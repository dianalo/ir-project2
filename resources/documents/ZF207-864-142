About 25 years later,black and white television gave way to color.andP;  The next leap, high resolutiontelevision coupled with CD quality stereo may be coming soon.andP;  Last April, inthe deep hours of the night, NBC, Channel 4 in New York City, announced atest: viewers would witness the first broadcast of the Sarnoff ResearchCenter's Advanced Compatible Television system.andM;The program of choice: the Saint Patrick's Day Parade.andP;  Researchers at theSarnoff Center in Princeton, NJ, watched the signal, which emanated from WNBCat the World Trade Center in New York, on experimental high-definitionmonitors.andP;  The Sarnoff group, along with ABC and General Electrichs consumerelectronics division, has invested $60 million to develop a system that hastwice the lines of regular TV screens (1050), scans at the same rate (29.97frames per second), and enhances the current standard signal.andP;  A plannedtwo-step approach to advanced television, the second phase would providegreater detail to those who bought wide-screen monitors, but it still wouldbe compatible with today's TVs.andM;The Sarnoff system is one of 20 advanced television research projects underway in this country, including those of the Zenith Electronics Group incooperation with ATandamp;T Microelectronics, Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology's Advanced Television Research Program, the New York Institute ofTechnology, the Del-Ray Group, and North American Philips.andP;  Many have appliedfor matching funds from DARPA, which has ear-marked $30 million for the nextthree years--half slated for transmission research and half for displaytechnology.andP;  As of august 1989, five companies had been granted money fordisplay technology.andP;  Newco Inc. of San Jose, CA, Raychem Corporation of MenloPark, CA, Texas Instruments Inc. of Dallas, TX, and Projectation Inc. of NewYork will receie money for projection display systems.andP;  Photonics TechnologyInc. of Northwood, OH, was selected for flat panel display technology.andP;  Moremoney may be forthcoming, as pressure is exerted to create systems to competewith or to supplant high-definition television (HDTV) as offered by Japan'snational broadcasting organization Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) and Europe'sEureka systems.andM;HDTV and The HillandM;HDTV has been a high priority this year for congressional committees.andP;  Tenhearings concerning HDTV have been held or proposed and nine bills thatrelate to it directly or indirectly have been introduced.andP;  The House Energyand Commerce's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance is mostspecifically concerned with HDTV.andP;  Although as of August, no bill had beenintroduced, the subcommittee is investigating ways to launch a U.S.andP;  HDTVindustry and safeguard U.S.andP;  industries that would be adversely affected by aJapanese-dominated HDTV industry.andP;  It is possible that an HDTV consortiumwill be recommended.andP;  The Senate Commerce, Science and TransportationCommittee has introduced the Technology Administrtion Authorization Act of1989, calling for $75 million for advanced imaging electronics, includingadvanced television, superconductors, X-ray lithography, and ceramics andcomposition.andP;  The committee's Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Spaceintroduced the National High-Performance Computer Technology Act of 1989,calling for $1.75 billion over five years for a national research andeducation fiber-optic computer network, science and technology databases andknowledge banks, high-performance scientific software, supercomputers, andbasic chip research.andP;  The Armed Services Committee eveluated DARPA's requestfor $100 million more and an authorization bill allocating $50 million isscheduled to go to the floor in September.andM;Although sometimes used interchangeably, advanced and high-definitiontelevision are not one and the same.andP;  Advanced television (ATV) woulddistribute wide-screen television signals with resolution substantiallybetter than current systems.andP;  It requires changes to current emissionregulations, including transmission standards.andP;  In addition, ATV would offerat least two-channel, CD-quality audio.andP;  HDTV can be thought of as a supersetof ATV; it would have about twice the horizontal and vertical resolution oftoday's TVs, a wide aspect ratio of 16 by 9, and better color and luminence.andO;So HDTV is ATV, but ATV is not necessarily HDTV.andP;  HDTV production equipmentcould be used for an ATV system that delivers entertainment to consumers.andO;HDTV, rather than ATV, has direct relevance to computer vendors interested innon-broadcast HDTV appications such as medical imaging or desktop publishing.andM;In the midst of all this techno-political activity, efforts are under way toset standards for the production and transmission of HDTV signals.andP;  It hasbeen difficult for standards proposals to went their way through severalorganizations.andP;  Some of the organizations involved are the FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) Advisory Committee, the Advanced TelevisionSystems Committee (ATSC), which makes recommendations to the U.S.andP;  StateDepartment, the Advanced Television Test Center set up by broadcastingorganizations), Cable TV Labs (also testing), and the International RadioConsultative Committee (CCIR).andP;  When the Society of Motion Picture andTelevision Engineers' (SMPTE) 240M production standard for analog signals waspresented last February to ANSI, the ABC television network blocked it with alegal challenge, citing &quot;lack of industry consensus.&quot; SMPTE 240M proposeddetailed parameters of the 1125/60 analog signal (see Table I, for acomparison of current television and proposed HDTV standards).andP;  Discussionsregarding the digital representation of 1125-line HDTV are currently underway in SMPTE's Working Group on High Definition Electronic Production.andP;  Oneof the concerns is the spacing between pixels on an HDTV screen for broadcastand non-broadcast applications and so several computer graphics companies aretaking positions on the matter.andM;Transmissions standards involve bandwidth constraints.andP;  Today, TV operatesaccording to the 1941 NTSC standard which calls for channels with 6-MHzspacing.andP;  The FCC has said that advanced television must take into accountNTSC television sets so that they do not become obsolete overnight.andP;  The 150million TV sets already in American households should be able to receive theHDTV signal, reasoned the FCC, even if viewers would not get the full benefitof the extra detial.andP;  The FCC is looking at proposals that reflect fourconcepts for terrestrial transmission of HDTV signals.andP;  The first, for whichthere are 10 proposals, including the Sarnoff ACTV system, is anNTSC-compatible system that adds information to the NTSC signal so that anadvanced TV could be viewed on a wide screen, at whatever HDTV parameterswere set.andP;  The second, for which there are three proposals, would provide theNTSC system with a 3-MHz augmentation channel.andP;  The ATV set would pick thatup and add it internally.andP;  The third scenario, comprising four proposals,calls for an NTSC signal and a 6-MHz augmentation channel.andP;  Finally, twoseparate channels could be simulcast, one for NTSC systems only and the otheroffering the same program in the ATV format (three proposals, includingZenith).andP;  Proposals using 9 MHz would be in the realm of satellite signals.andO;Japan's NHK falls into this category.andM;Between the FCC transmission guideline, the signal output by HDTV productionsystems (between 30 and 90 MHz), and the need for new display systems, thetechnical challenges are immense.andP;  As Robert Hopkins, ATSC Executive Directorsays, &quot;You have to do an awful lot of squeezing to get 90 MHz through a 6-MHzchannel.&quot;andP;  But while Japan's HDTV is largely analog-based andsatellite-transmitted, many U.S.andP;  HDTV systems under development areanalog/digital hybrids that would evolve into fully digital systems.andP;  Yetlast spring and summer, the reams of testimony of computer industry leaders,DARPA, and the American Electronics Association (AEA), to name just a few,pointed to a battle between analog and digital technologists.andP;  The morefocused fight has been for funds as TVs become more like computers andcomputers become more like TVs.andP;  In the meantime, as companies develop HDTVprototypes for FCC review in April 1990, video and electronic engineers areencountering hardware and software challenges.andM;HDTV and the Semiconductor IndustryandM;Before Congressman Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Chair of theTelecommunications and Finance Committee, first heard testimony in 1987, hethought HDTV was only important to the mass media industry.andP;  After hiscommittee's first hearings, he &quot;realized that HDTV will impact far more thanjust America's broadcast, cable, and direct broadcast satellite industries.&quot;andO;Speaking at the First Annual HDTV Conference, sponsored by the HDTVNewsletter, Advanced Television Publishing in Portland, OR, Markey said lastJune, &quot;We have learned that HDTV may represent the convergence of thetelevision, computer, and telephone industries.andP;  It is virtually a certaintythat HDTV receivers, monitors and videocassette recorders will besemiconductor-intensive.andP;  When you open up the back of an HDTV set you have avirtual computer.andP;  In fact, some engineers predict that the televisionreceiver of the year 2000 will contain a greater number and moresophisticated microchips than the personal computer of the year 1990.&quot;andP;  TheCongressman was well-familiar with the 1988 report of the AEA's AdvancedTelevision Task Force economic Impact Team.andP;  In its section onsemiconductors, excerpted in the sidebar on page 1304, the reprt states:&quot;U.S.andP;  semiconductor manufacturers will be excluded or reduced to a verysmall marketshare of the very large HDTV market unless U.S.-ownedmanufacturers of HDTV products exist and unless they purchase componentryfrom U.S.andP;  semiconductor manufacturers.&quot;andP;  The report also forecast the impacta strong, medium, or weak American HDTV industry would have on oursemiconductor industry (see Table II).andP;  The strong scenario represents a casewhere 50 percent of the U.S.andP;  market for HDTV is controlled by U.S.andP;  firms,medium would mean 30 percent, and weak would mean 10 percent.andP;  By the year2010, semiconductor sales would reach an estimated $124 billion with a strongU.S.andP;  HDTV sector, $99 billion with a medium HDTV sector, and $62 billionwith a weak HDTV industry, according to the report.andP;  This would mean that thecurrent 41 percent world marketshare would hold in a strong HDTV scenario,but fall to 20.5 percent in a week HDTV scenario.andM;HDTV and PCsandM;But the HDTV industry's clout as a semiconductor user is only part of theimpact it could have on the computer industry.andP;  The report also predicted athreat to the U.S.andP;  personal computer industry.andP;  The AEA 1988 report stated:&quot;Many agree that in the next 10 years HDTV receivers/VCRs will be able toconnect to 100 MBytes of data storage, a variety of floppy disk drives,printers, fax machines, telephones, and many other products and enhancements.andO;As this takes place, the U.S.andP;  personal computer industry will be faced withits most significant marketing challenge.andP;  This challenge will be twofold: 1)Sophisticated HDTV products may compete with home personal computers forconsumer dollars.andP;  2) More significantly, if the Japanese virtually own theHDTV industry, their HDTV engineering, consumer product research, andmarketing will enable them to greatly increase their ability to manufacture avariety of personal computers with substantial consumer appeal andacceptance.&quot;andP;  Like the semiconductor section of the report, personal computersales predictions for the year 2010 were made for strong, medium, and weakHDTV scenarios.andP;  With a strong HDTV base, personal computers would attain$221 billion in sales, in contrast with $110 billion in sales with a weakHDTV scenario.andP;  In terms of the percentage of worldwide market share, in astrong HDTV scenario, the U.S.andP;  would maintain the 70 percent share it hastoday, but in a weak HDTV scenario, the U.S.andP;  market share would fall to 35percent.andM;Mike Liebhold, Manager of Media Application Research in Apple Computer Inc.'sAdvanced Technology Group, who was interviewed for the AEA study, disagreeswith many of its findings.andP;  He says that the AEA study does not take intoaccount the potential economic impact of new applications with abundantvideo.andP;  &quot;What will transform the PC and video industries is a fundamentalunderstanding of the real applications of integrated video and computing, aswe're beginning to see with hypermedia,&quot; he asserts.andP;  Documents with embeddedvideo for instructional purposes or advertising applications, for example,could alter the public's television viewing habits.andP;  Or suppose thateventually you could dial up a video instead of having to go to the videostore and rent one, and regular NTSC video was sent over broadband.andP;  &quot;That'svideo on demand, with your personal computer acting as a database machine,&quot;says Liebhold.andP;  &quot;There are so many applications that could dilute the AEAprojections, which are based on a 1960s model of TV viewing,&quot; he says.andM;Liebhold is pessimistic about one worldwide standard being reached and heexpects HDTV to fragment into Japanese, European and American formats.andP;  Inaddition, there are other emerging formats like 1.5-Mbit per second,full-motion digital video that can be stored in CD-ROM, of which DVI is thefirst, and compressed video that can be sent at data rates of 56 to 64 Kbitsper second for picture phones.andP;  All of these will be vying for engineeringresources and the consumer pocketbook, he says.andP;  &quot;It's sad.andP;  We're just atthe beginning of promising digital processing and we ought to encourage truedigital video processing,&quot; he says.andM;Robert Cohen, an economist preparing a report entitled &quot;TelecommunicationsPolicy and the Emergence of High Definition Television&quot; for the EconomicPolicy Institute, testified before Markey's Committee last March.andP;  Heinterpreted the AEA's 1988 figures, and did dilute them, but for entirelydifferent reasons that Liebhold's.andP;  Cohen adjusted the strong, medium andweak scenarios to include estimates for how much of the U.S.andP;  market sharewould be produced in the U.S., as opposed to produced offshore by U.S.-ownedfacilities.andP;  (See Table III.)andP;  Sales for domestically produced personalcomputers in a strong HDTV scenario would be $176 billion rather than $221billion, for example.andP;  Cohen described a kind of &quot;feedback mechanism thatprovides its greatest advantages to our industrial base when the entire 'foodchain' of the electronics industry is improved.&quot;andP;  HDTVs will be used in thehome as display screens for personal computers, he said, and both HDTV andflat display screen technologies &quot;are intimately linked, economically, to theimprovement of our personal computer.&quot;andP;  Further, &quot;When a personal computeradopts the kind of flat display screen associated with HDTV technology, itwill not only create additional demand for the products associated with thisnew industry, but it will also require a large number of semiconductors tosupport the new projector and display technology that will be incorporated inthe screen itself,&quot; he said.andP;  But Liebhold says, &quot;Display is only one reasonwhy people might hook a personal computer to their TV.andP;  People have differentbehaviors for different appliances.andP;  Work, learning, and play are the threeuses for computers in the home.andP;  Only on the entertainment side is therelikely to be convergence.andP;  But they still occur in different locations in thehouse.andP;  There will continue to be redundant displays throughout thehouse--count the CRTs you have now.&quot;andM;Cohen also generated figures estimating the trade balance and jobs that wouldbe created.andP;  The trade balance would range from a surplus of about $10billion to an enormous deficit of $227 billion in one year, said Cohen, withthe semiconductor and personal computer industries as the main contributors.andO;Under a weak HDTV scenario, their respective contributions to the projecteddeficit would be $76 billion and $114 billion.andP;  Employment in thesemiconductor industry would grow due to 331,000 new jobs in a strongscenario but 83,000 jobs would exist under a weak scenario.andP;  The personalcomputer industry would grow to 588,000 under a strong scenario compared to147,000 under a weak scenario.andP;  Only in discussing the total employmentpicture for these industries and HDTV receivers.andP;  VCRs, and manufacturing,which could range from 1.1 million to 274,000, did Cohen mention emergingdigital technologies.andP;  He said, &quot;These estimates also fail to allow for newindustries that might emerge as a result of the commercial development ofdigital television, digital communications, and innovative flat-screendisplays between now and the year 2010.&quot;andM;The report's proponents seem to be saying that U.S.andP;  HDTV is good for U.S.andO;personal computers, but that Japanese HDTV would compete with U.S.andP;  personalcomputers.andP;  But what would stop U.S.andP;  HDTVs from competing with U.S.andO;personal computers?andP;  Furthermore, what will PCs be like in the year 2010 whentoday the lines between them and workstations are already blurring?andM;HDTV vs a Fiber-Optic Network?andM;Workstation vendors in the computer graphics arena, including SiliconGraphics Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., and Symbolics Inc. have been vocalabout HDTV-related issues.andP;  At SIGGRAPH '89, Silicon Graphics Chairman andFounder Jim Clark donated time that had been allocated for his company'spress conference to hold one devoted to HDTV and testimony he had justdelivered to the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space in July.andO;Larry Smarr, Director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign also addressed the press.andM;In May and June, the Subcommittee held hearings on a National TechnologyStrategy for HDTV and on Supercomputing and an Information Superhighway.andP;  InJuly, Subcommittee Chairman senator Al Gore (D), of Tennessee, introducedhearings on Visualization, AI, and Advanced Computer Software by emphasizingthe merits of scientific visualization and supercomputing.andP;  He then went onto say, &quot;There's been a great deal of talk about HDTV and how the Japaneseare going to beat us in that market.andP;  But Japanese HDTV is just a betterversion of old analog TV technology.andP;  We can't just worry about HDTV, we needto pay attention to the next revolution in TV technology--digital TV.andP;  Thetechnology being developed for visualization can be used to developsuper-high-resolution digital television and the same fiber-optic networkthat links computers today could be used to carry digital TV signals in thefuture.andP;  The U.S.andP;  has a lead in visualization and networking, but we need toredouble our efforts in order to keep that lead and to leapfrog the Japanese.andO;We can lead the digital TV revolution.&quot;andM;At the press conference, Clark and Smarr described their vision of afiber-optic infrastructure and &quot;National Co-laboratory&quot; whereby the nation'ssupercomputing centers and desktop computers everywhere would be linked.andO;Everyone could share weather and space data, for example.andP;  Instead of thecurrent NSF 1.5 million bits/sec network serving 10,000 faculty and studentsat 200 universities using five centers, the new network would be afiber-optic digital environment 2,000 times faster at 3 billion bits/sec.andO;Since glass can probably sustain 1,000 times that, Smarr explained, such anetwork would be a tremendous investment in the future and the benefits wouldalso be felt by consumers.andP;  &quot;We're talking about utilizing some of that, withthe government acting as a seed partner to empower a research environment.andO;Obviously we hope that the capabilities that we can demonstrate will helpguide the consumer revolution that fiber-optic cable to the home wouldprovide,&quot; Smarr said.andM;While most of the discussion in Washington and the media has centered aroundHDTV, said Smarr, &quot;from our point of view, HDTV is simply one service thatsuch a fiber-optic network would enable.&quot; As we move from an analog world toa digital, interactive one, said Smarr, and from intermediate storage levelslike cartridges, and CDs &quot;your workstation will probably become a largescreen on a wall that is your port into information space, whether fromtelecomputing if you stay at home and work, or whether for entertainment.andP;  Weexpect to see this merging of the consumer demand for services with thescientific reserch needs to empower the economy during the next decade.&quot;andP;  AndJim Clark stated that HDTVs and home computers will be one and the sameelectronically.andP;  &quot;One might buy a home computer and it delivers HDTV or onemight buy one as a television and it does home computing,&quot; he said, &quot;Themarkets will essentially collide.andP;  Fiber optics will be the predominentdelivery means.&quot;andM;Clark also addressed transmission standards and efforts to create analog HDTVsystems given the limitations of frequency spectra.andP;  &quot;I believe that thenotion of trying to retrofit existing TV with high-definition andconsolidating frequency bands in order to achieve broadcast TV in the way wedo it today is a dead end,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If we pursue that, we will ultimatelyfind that the best way to deliver this is over fiber.&quot;andP;  Referring to otherrequests for funds before Congress to assist U.S.andP;  companies to that end, hesaid, &quot;That technology is already owned by the Japanese and its more or lessridiculous to chase after it.andP;  We should recognize the trend away frombroadcast to cable--there are estimates away from broadcast to cable--thereare estimates that 30 to 50 percent of homes receive TV over cable--andthere's a trend from analog to digital.andP;  Digital is a more robust way ofcommunication.&quot;andM;Clark noted an imbalance between the performance improvement in computingcompared to networks during the last decade.andP;  &quot;Computing performance hasincreased by roughly a factor of 60 in 10 years.andP;  That same computingperforamnce price has gone down by a factor of 10.andP;  That's a combined factorof 500 to 600 performance improvement in computing in the last 10 years.andP;  Buton the networking side there has been a factor of about 3 to 5.andP;  It's veryimbalanced.&quot;andP;  In addition, he cited a &quot;tremendous imbalance&quot; between acomputer's internal data communication rates and intra-computer data rates.andO;Personal computers can move data around internally at about 1/30 GBit/sec andmost RISC processors have internal data rates of 0.5 GBit/sec.andP;  Somesupercomputers used for visualization manipulate data at rates between 3 to 5GBits.andP;  And a single static HDTV image contains roughly 1/30 of a Gbit, so tobroadcast one digital HDTV channel requires a bandwidth of 1 GBit per second(30 images per second), said Clark.andP;  These rates show that 40 personalcomputers, four workstations or two visualization supercomputers with today'stechnology could easily saturate a 3-GBit network.andP;  &quot;My only concern about(the proposed fiber-optic network) is that it is not ambitious enough,&quot; saidClark.andP;  What Senator Gore has called an &quot;Interstate Data Highway System&quot;Clark believes could &quot;very well be a country road by 1996.&quot;andP;  Clark is callingfor Gore to change the distribution of requested funds, which would be splitbetween numerical software and artificial intelligence research, to 30percent for numerial software, 20 percent for AI, 30 percent forvisualization, and 20 percent for AI, 30 percent for visualization, and 20percent for networking.andM;In closing, Smarr argued that a digital fiber-optic infrastucture is a longerterm solution to retaining technological leadership that is HDTV and that itwould combine technologies in which the United States still has the leadingedge.andP;  &quot;We're basing (the infrastructure) on workstations, fiber optics, andsupercomputers, in which the U.S.andP;  is the unquestioned leader.andP;  I'd like tosee a national infrastructure built on American strength and one that is alongterm investment--in digital technology, which is in its infancy, ratherthan analog technology, which is at the end of its lifecycle.&quot;andP;  Although theHDTV issue has arisen with regard to consumers, and personal computers,workstations and supercomputers have been issues for researchers, Smarr says,they have a common solution through the fiber-optic network.andP;  But &quot;Thecountry probably doesn't have enough money or time to do both independent ofeach other.andP;  Discussions on the Hill for both are merging together,&quot; he said.andM;HDTV and WorkstationsandM;While Clark and Smarr were expressing these views, another workstationvendor, Symbolics, was demonstrating its readiness for HDTV on the SIGGRAPHexhibition floor.andP;  They presented &quot;The Little Death,&quot; directed by Matt Elsonand produced by March Scaparro, which they say is the longest HDTV computergraphics piece produced in the U.S.andP;  It had premiered the night before at theannual film and video review and was presented again later at an HDTV Panelby Graphics Division Marketing Director Don Miscowich.andP;  Created and renderedwith Symbolics Paint and Animation software (S-Products release 4.1) on theSymbolics 3650, it was recorded in SMPTE 240M format on a Sony HDD-1000digital tape deck with simultaneous recording on a Sony HDV-1000 analogrecorder.andP;  At the booth it was shown on a Sony HDM-2820 monitor.andP;  For thefilm and video review the analog version was projected with current standardequipment.andP;  In the future, the digital version will be the path forconversion to 35mm film.andM;Symbolics was showing support for SMPTE 240M, but the company espouses aphilosophy of format flexibility, so the software and hardware also supportsa variety of other standards including NTSC, PAL, and the European HDT Eureka1250-line format.andP;  so what was Symbolics, known for symbolic processingsystems usually used for expert systems development, CASE, and CAD/CAE,really showing off? Says Thomas McMahom, General Manager and Director ofResearch and Development for Symbolics' Graphics Division, &quot;What we're reallydoing is putting a stake in the ground saying, 'Look, high-def is a goodthing.andP;  We are committed to it as a U.S.andP;  manufacturer, and we believe itoffers great promise in a lot of applications.&quot;andP;  The 1000-line video systemsthat all engineering workstations have are, in a sense, HDTV, says McMahon.andO;&quot;It is really nothing different from what computer people have been doing forten years now.andP;  But workstations were designed to do one thing and one thingonly, and that's compute a frame on the screen about 30 to 60 times a secondfor intractive engineering applications,&quot; he says.andP;  There has been nomechanism in most engineering workstations for capturing that sequence ofimages and storing it.andP;  &quot;High-def tape machines all of a sudden offer amedium for the storage and retrieval of information at phenomenal bandwidthsand phenomenal densities in real time.andP;  And this is one reason I think it'sgoing to have an impact on a lot of applications that have traditionally runon these sorts of workstations.&quot;andP;  But, flexibility is essential: &quot;If yourrenderer only knows how to compute at NTSC, or only knows how to compute atPAL, you're very, very limited market-wise,&quot; says McMahon.andP;  He anticipates anevolution toward HDTV.andP;  &quot;The broadcasters have a vested interest in thiswhole thing.andP;  They can't afford to change every transmitter in the U.S.andO;right now, so they're lobbying extremely hard that we retain a 6-MHz channel,even if it causes a great degradation.andP;  You can get a pretty good picturethrough a 6-MHz channel, but it's still a compromise, and a lot of peoplewould like to see something else defined that's a superset of that.andP;  There'llbe a gradual phase-in over time.&quot;andM;Symbolics is focusing not so much on enertainment, but on storing andretrieving high-definition medical and reconnaissance satellite images inreal time.andP;  Users in these areas &quot;have never before been able to deal withthese images live at that resolution.andP;  That's going to destabilize all thesemarkets at the high end, and we're going to be there,&quot; McMahon says, &quot;Webelieve we're first with a lot of this technology.&quot;andM;Symbolics drew on in-house VLSI talent that had developed its Ivory computeron a chip.andP;  Using the same tool kit used for Ivory, they developed an 11-chipset for supporting a high-definition display board, called Photon.andP;  Theheterogeneous display design had to be very fast and have an extremely highbandwidth on the order of 640 megabytes per second.andP;  It includes a SIMD(Single Instruction Multiple Data) processor, a MIMD (Multiple InstructionMultiple Data) processor, a vector pipeline, and a scalar processor.andP;  Alsoincorporated in Photon architecture is the ability to capture and thenupconvert images from NTSC to HDTV.andM;Although in favor of a fiber-optic network, McMahon notes that it willrequire new protocols.andP;  Trying to implement a gigabit per second undertoday's Ethernet protocols would mean that about 90 percent of the bandwidthwould go to waste simply because of overhead in the local CPUs trying tomanage the process, he explains.andM;Square Pixels, CRTs and New Display SystemsandM;At the SIGGRAPH HDTV panel, representatives from Japan's NHK and New VideoSystems Research Association showed HDTV clips including &quot;Flora,&quot; by thewell-know computer graphics artist, Yoichiro Kawaguchi, of Nippon ElectronicsCollege.andP;  This piece, which also appeared in the film and video review, wascreated on an Iris 40/70 with GROWTH model by Metaball.andP;  Kawaguchi declaredHDTV &quot;the salvation of computer graphics.&quot;andM;Symbolics' flexibility on certain issues caused some disagreements to beaired during the question-and-answer period that followed.andP;  The firstquestion raised was whether the Symbolics demonstration had square pixels,and if not, why.andP;  Don Miscowich said they were not square, and then added,&quot;Symbolics considers square pixels a non-issue.andP;  We feel that the state ofthe art allows you to pick whatever aspect ratio you want for pixels and allthe processing we anticipate having to do on images can be handled quiteeasily whether it's square or non-square.&quot;andP;  Another member of the audience,Glenn Reitmeier of the David Sarnoff Research Center, replied that hestrongly disagreed.andP;  &quot;Symbolics may have a lot of extra computing power lyingaround ...andP;  to turn 2-D bit map problems into geometry problems, but I don'tthink that's so everywhere,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Look at something as simple asturning an HDTV on its side to display something that's typeset like anewspaper page.andP;  You're going to be dealing with a 44 percent aspect ratio(instead of 4 percent).&quot; While there are solutions to that problem, he said,these involve extra computing power or hardware to correct it.andP;  That would becostly for interactive graphics, he noted.andP;  Miscowich had no further comment,but Reitmeier explained the origin of the non-square pixel standard.andP;  andthen commented, &quot;In terms of HDTV standards, both square pixels andprogressive scan are clearly issues that have to be addressed in future HDTVstandards.andP;  These are issues of great concern in the video industry whichwould benefit from some of your input.&quot;andP;  The audience applauded.andM;In fact, Sun Microsystems has been actively advocating square pixels.andP;  At theFirst Annual HDTV Conference last June, Charles A. Poynton, Staff Engineer,said that without square pixels, HDTV will not be embraced by the computergraphics community, which has square pixels now.andP;  &quot;The property of sampleshaving equal horizontal and vertical spacing will be important in HDTVapplications related to computer graphics, and could contribute greatly tothe acceptance of the detailed HDTV parameters in systems for printing andpublishing, medical applications, simulator applications, and othernon-broadcast industries.&quot;andP;  He explained his objections to the currentproposals in the latest CCIR document and the appendix of SMPTE 240M, whichcall for 1035 lines of 1920 &quot;active&quot; samples.andP;  Non-square pixels are theresult of choosing HDTV smapling parameters that have a close relationshipwith existing 525- and 625-line television parameters.andP;  The sampling numberschosen for digital sampling of the 1125/60 system are 1920 active samples perline and 1035 active lines.andP;  1920 is derived from the 720 active samples perline of 525- and 625-line systems according to CCIR Recommendation 601-1,times two for a nominal doubling of horizontal resolution, times 4/3, toreflect the increase in picture aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9, 1035 is thefraction 23/25 of the total number of lines; this fraction is the same ascurrently used in 525 and 625 systems.andP;  Adopting these relationships comes atthe expense of producing an unequal horizontal and vertical sample spacing,or &quot;non-square pixels.&quot;andP;  This relationship has no benefit to receivers, butaffects certain pieces of studio equipment.andP;  Poynton believes that makingHDTV systems applicable to the computer industry is much moe important thanoptimizing the system for a particular piece of studio equipment, and thatthis broader goal can be achieved only by choosing an HDTV standard withsquare piexels.andP;  Square pixels can be achieved in the 1125/60 system byincreasing the number of active lines to 1080, by reducing the number ofactive samples per line to 1840, or in mnay other ways.andP;  There is muchdiscussion of the choice of 1080 active lines in the internationalstandardization community, as this may allow the standardization of a &quot;CommonImage Format&quot; which would implement the same pixel structure worldwide eventhough raster structures and frame rates may differ.andM;Poynton says that non-broadcast users, potentially the largest HDTV userswithin two to six years, are not represented on standards committees.andP;  SMPTE,with its constituency of broadcasters and broadcast studio equipmentmanufacturers, is likely to recommend parameters appropriate for thoseapplications Poynton says.andP;  The result could burden non-broadcast users witha frame rate of 59.94 Hz, simply because it would maximize consistency withNTSC, which would be convenient for broadcasters.andP;  &quot;Unless the concerns ofnon-broadcasters are expressed within SMPTE, the broadcast orientation willprevail, and by the time the impact of these issues is felt by thenon-broadcast users, it will be too late to change,&quot; Poynton warns.andM;But no matter what the shape of pixels will be for HDTVs, their total numberwill be a problem for CRTs.andP;  Today's TVs display 500,000 pixels, workstationsdisplay up to 1.25 million, and HDTVs would display 2 million.andP;  &quot;Theprobability that we'll be using glass CRTs in the next 10 to 20 years, isvery, very low,&quot; says Silicon Graphics' Jim Clark.andP;  &quot;This notion of the glassCRT, which is an entirely Japanese-owned industry, has to fade,&quot; he says, &quot;Ifwe're really interested in revitalizing that segment of U.S.andP;  industry,Congress should allocate money for research on alternative displaymechanisms.&quot;andP;  The glass CRT is simply too big, he explains, it gets verydifficult to move a magnetic field at the rates necessary to generate thepixels in a high-definition system.andP;  Every pixel is put up in about 8nanoseconds.andP;  With four times as many pixels, the magnetic field energy istremendous because you have a high current going through the screen in orderto illuminate the phosphor.andP;  So it's really a severely limited technology,says Clark.andM;The military, which has very tight weight and space requirements for aircraftcockpits, command control displays, and tanks, is driving the need foralternative displays.andP;  DARPA is therefore funding projection and flat paneldisplay systems.andP;  Projectavision, of Westbury, New York, is one of fivecompanies to receive the first round of funds from DARPA (see sidebar on page1310.andM;Besides its joint venture with ATandamp;T Microelectronics, Zenith is also vyingfor dollars for display technology.andP;  It seeks $10 million from DARPA for its$21.5 million development program for flat tension mask picture tubes.andP;  Ithas already spent $60 million to develop this technology for regular-sizedTVs, and now wants to create large-screen versions.andP;  &quot;We are convinced thatsets based on direct-view picture tubes--and not projectors based on flatpanels or tubes--will have the largest share of the HDTV market, by far,&quot;says Zenith Chairman and President, Jerry Pearlman, &quot;Direct-view picturetubes are the most cost-effective means of building a high-resolutioncomputer or TV screen of less than 35 inches in diagonal.andP;  Projection systemsbased on tubes or flat panel displays cost roughly the same regardless of howlarge or small you make the image on the screen or on the wall, but with apicture tube, the smaller the screen, the lower the cost.&quot;andP;  But others pointout that flat screens are needed for pictures with a 37-inch diagonal orlarge.andP;  Says ATandamp;T's Ralph Cerbone, &quot;Tube technology has been improved andrefined over the years, but the fact of the matter is that people aredemanding large screens and today the only way to do that is through aprojection TV arrangement.andP;  Projection TV would require some additionalrefinement to handle HDTV, but it can certainly do it.andP;  But flat screendisplays are really the goal.&quot; That is where the most innovation for thesemiconductor applications for HDTV will be, he says.andP;  &quot;We're doing work onflat screens along with many other companies throughout the U.S., Japan, andEurope.andP;  But nobody's got a corner on it yet.&quot;andM;Given all the tugging and pushing for standards and funds and adamantly heldpoints of view by many different experts, there must be a lot at stake.andP;  Butthere is a great deal of confusion and people may be talking at crosspurposes.andP;  Every few years, politicians and lobbyists seem to notice anindustry that is leaving American shores.andP;  There have been cries for anindustrial policy as the Japanese cornered the automotive industry and thenagain as they cornered the DRAM market.andP;  Is television any different?andP;  IsU.S.andP;  re-entry into consumer electronics via HDTV the solution?andP;  Whether HDTVcomes from offshore or not, television as we know it today will changesynergistically, as the computer industry evolves.andM;AEA Assessment of HDTV's Impact on U.S.andP;  Semiconductor IndustryandM;The following excerpt is from the AEA 1988 report, &quot;High DefinitionTelevision (HDTV): Analysis and Impact.&quot;andM;Although there are many important industry product segments to be impacted byHDTV technology, most agree that semiconductors are the most strategicallyimportant to the U.S.andM;The Japanese have taken a significant lead in developing faster, moe compactIC packaging technology and &quot;driver&quot; integrated circuits (ICs)--virtually allof which are made outside the U.S.andP;  Two critical areas in which the U.S.andO;must maintain its lead are in computer technology and defense systems.andM;Even before the introduction of HDTV, memory consumption in digital featureTV and IDTV will approach that consumed by personal computers on a worldwidebasis by 1991, and easily surpass it by the mid-1990s.andM;The fact that the Japanese dominate the DRAM market today will haveincreasingly significant impact as the memory consumption of elevisionproducts surpasses personal computers.andP;  This is in part because, although apersonal computer's DRAMs must be absolutely perfect, a DRAM for a televisionreceiver does not.andM;For instance, a personal computer manufacturer cannot use a DRAM with anyimperfection, because it would create incorrect bits in a computerapplication.andP;  However, that same DRAM--defective for personal computers--issuitable for television, where it would only impair a pixel or two.andM;The consequences of a few inaccurate pixels are not anywhere near the drasticimperfection of incorrect bits in a computer application.andP;  Thus, verticallyintegrated Japanese producers may have an outlet for up to 10 percent oftheir DRAM production that is currently being scrapped.andP;  This wouldsignificantly lower their overall costs and be another edge over U.S.andP;  DRAMmanufacturers and purchasers, such as U.S.andP;  personal computer companies.andM;To consider the impact of HDTV on the U.S.andP;  semiconductor industry, it ishelpful to understand the current breakdown of U.S.andP;  semiconductormanufacturers' sales in the U.S.: Market  Percent Communications  11.0Computer  44.4 Consumer  6.4 Government  12.5 Industrial  15.3 Transportation10.4andM;Because the large HDTV market will allow the Japanese to rapidly descendtheir learning curves, they can easily keep the U.S.andP;  and other foreigncompetitors out of the markets for vital semiconductors--as occurred in thelast decade in CMOS circuitry and CCD (charge-coupled device).andM;Furthermore, U.S.andP;  semiconductor manufacturers will be in an increasinglyweak position to sell to overseas markets or to get their products into HDTVproducts that are built in the U.S.andP;  by foreign-owned manufacturers.andM;In turn, this significant lost business also reduces the ability of U.S.andO;semiconductor manufacturers to compete effectively in other end use equipmentsectors, such as personal computers.andM;Thus, semiconductor projections ...andP;  follow the same trend line as theprojections for personal computers ...andP;  only more so.andP;  If the U.S.andP;  loses itssubstantial lead in personal computers, it follows that this will severelyimpact the U.S.andP;  semiconductor industry.andM;Although volume is the major long-term concern, it is not the primary concernof the U.S.andP;  semiconductor industry relative to HDTV.andP;  Engineeringinnovations is the overriding issue.andM;In mid-1988, several managers from a top U.S.andP;  semiconductor firm were ableto preview the 40-chip set for HDTV receivers that has been developed by aJapanese firm.andP;  Validation that these chips already existed--a concern theU.S.andP;  executives had feared--was greatly overshadowed by the realization thattheir engineers probably did not even know how to engineer the chips.andP;  Thelevel of sophistication in consumer electronics had taken another quantumleap forward.andM;Presently, only 6 percent of U.S.andP;  semiconductor output compared to 50percent of Japan's semiconductor output is used in consumer electronicsproducts.andP;  Without a major U.S.-controlled presence, the economies of scaleprovided by this new HDTV market are likely to drastically reduce the currentworldwide share enjoyed by U.S.andP;  semiconductor manufacturers.andM;It was the unanimous consensus of every industry executive interviewed thatthe minor sales into the consumer products market by U.S.andP;  semiconductormanufacturers is one of the primary reasons they are currently struggling invirtually all markets worldwide.andM;Worldwide sales of semiconductors into consumer electronics products areestimated to be at least $10 billion in 1988.andP;  If the U.S.andP;  does notparticipate in the HDTV market, everyone surveyed is concerned the U.S.andO;could lose any current technological superiority it has in other markets assemiconductor products designed for consumer electronics--includingHDTV--broaden their applications into other significant end use markets.andM;Such a trend has grown recently because of the increased use of digitalcircuits in consumer applications.andP;  This makes the lack of participation byU.S.andP;  companies in consumer electronics even more critical as these digitalcircuits can also be used easily for industrial applications such ascomputers and telecommunications.andM;This technological edge question is further compounded because themanufacturing expertise in high-volume, low cost, high reliability consumerparts is directly applicable to smaller volume, industrial applications.andO;Therefore, the odds are significantly in favor of the market leader(s) inhigh volume semiconductors eventually dominating the markets for smallervlume semiconductors.andM;The impact of HDTV technology on U.S.andP;  semiconductor manufacturers isstraightforward:andM;U.S.andP;  semiconductor manufacturers will be excluded or reduced to a very smallmarket share of the very large HDTV market unless U.S.-owned manufacturers ofHDTV products exist and unless they purchase componentry from U.S.andO;semiconductor manufacturers.andM;The European community may be more likely than the Japanese to buy U.S.andO;semiconductors, because of the European weakness in semiconductor production.andM;The consensus of those interviewed agreed that without a reasonableparticipation in the HDTV marketplace by U.S.andP;  manufacturers, the outlook forthe U.S.andP;  semiconductor industry is bleak.andM;Source: &quot;High Definition Television (HDTV): Economic Analysis and Impact,&quot;November, 1988, American Electronics Association, pp.andP;  3-8 to 3-10.andM;U.S.andP;  Participation is Necessary--The ATVandM;&quot;Ripple Effect&quot;andM;As technology advances from ATV come about, they will predictably &quot;ripple&quot;out and erode market share in non-consumer electronics fields.andP;  First willlikely be in semiconductors, then in others such as test equipment, software,and automated manufacturing equipment.andP;  Eventually, it is believed thatvirtually every key electronic industry segment will be impacted.andP;  Theauthors of the AEA ATV Task Force's &quot;Economic impact Report&quot; discoveredlikely HDTV impact on several industry segments.andP;  They pointed out disturbingtrends:andM;Assuming technical knowledge from HDTV is used by our foreign tradingpartners as leverage to erode personal computer markets, the U.S.andP;  wouldlikely need to gain half the U.S.andP;  HDTV market over the next 20 years or loseas much as 50 percent of its computer market share of 70 percent.andP;  Anidentical trend for semiconductors seems probable.andM;The semiconductor industries predictably will feel the ATV technology effectsfirst.andP;  HDTV will gobbe computer memory chips.andP;  The HDTV semiconductor impactis twofold: Loss of market volume and loss of technological know-how.andP;  Thelatter becomes strategically critical--adding national security issues to theeconomic concerns.andM;Today, only 6 percent of U.S.andP;  semiconductor units are used in consumerelectronics products worldwide compared to 50 percent of Japanese units.andO;Following historical patterns, foreign companies--whether located in the U.S.andO;or in their home countries--will produce or buy integrated circuits (ICs)from their home country suppliers.andP;  In this event, U.S.andP;  semiconductormanufacturers will not only lose market share in America, but over time willbecome less competitive in world markets.andM;Source: &quot;Development of a U.S.-Based ATV Industry,&quot;
