The intent of this noticeis to discuss the results of USEPA's review of the Wisconsin Departmentof Natural Resources (WDNR) redesignation request and to provide an opportunityfor the public to comment on it and USEPA's proposed action. Under theClean Air Act (CAA) and USEPA's transitional particulate matter policy(July 1, 1987, 52 FR 24682), TSP designations can continue to be changedif sufficient data are available to warrant such a change. USEPA will continueto process TSP redesignation requests because various regulatory provisionsremain tied to an attainment status.USEPA is proposing to disapprove Wisconsin's redesignation request becausethe WDNR failed to provide any evidence that (1) the monitoring data wererepresentative of worst-case ambient concentrations, (2) emission reductionswhich were federally approved and permanent, resulted in the decrease inambient concentrations, and (3) dispersion techniques were not responsiblefor the improvement in air quality. These redesignation criteria are containedin an April 21, 1983, memorandum entitled ``Section 107 Designation PolicySummary'' from Sheldon Meyers, then Director, Office of Air Quality Planningand Standards (OAQPS), and a September 30, 1985, memorandum entitled ``TotalSuspended Particulate (TSP) Redesignations'' from Gerald A.

For Wisconsin, see 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978),43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978), and 40 CFR 81.350. These area designationsare subject to revision whenever sufficient data become available to warranta redesignation. A sub-city area of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, was designatedas not attaining the secondary TSP standard.\1\<NOTE/> On July 23, 1987, pursuant to section 107(d)(5) of the CAA,the WDNR requested that the sub-city nonattainment area of Oshkosh be redesignatedto attainment of the TSP NAAQS.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Oshkosh sub-city nonattainment area is defined asfollows: North: Corner Irving Ave. East to Bowen St. West: Corner OhioSt. and West 11th Ave. North to Route 26/44, continue Northeast along Route26/44 to intersection with Irving Avenue. South: Corner Ohio St. and West11th Ave., East along West 11th Ave. to Lake Winnebago. East: Corner IrvingAve. and Bowen St., South along Bowen to Lake Winnebago. Remainder of WinnebagoCounty, better than national standards.USEPA revised the particulate matter standard on July 1, 1987, (52 FR 24634)and eliminated the TSP ambient air quality standard. The revised standardis expressed in terms of particulate matter with a nominal diameter of10 micrometers or less (PM<T2>10</T2>). USEPA will continue to process redesignations of areas fromnonattainment to attainment or unclassifiable for TSP in keeping with pastpolicy, because various regulatory provisions such as new source reviewand prevention of significant deterioration are keyed to the attainmentstatus of areas. The July 1, 1987, notice (p. 24682, column 1) describedUSEPA's transition policy regarding TSP redesignations.According to USEPA's transition policy, TSP redesignation requests willbe reviewed for compliance with USEPA's redesignation policies issued inmemoranda on April 21, 1983, and September 30, 1985.USEPA's specific criteria for TSP redesignations, as identified in thesepolicies, and USEPA's analysis of Wisconsin's request under these criteriaare as follows:<T3>Criterion 1</T3>Violation-free monitoring data_Eight consecutive quarters of the most recentair quality data must reveal no violations of the TSP NAAQS. Monitors mustbe placed at the points of expected maximum TSP impact.WDNR submitted three years of violation-free data for four sites in Oshkoshand 2 years of data from an additional two sites in Oshkosh. However, theWDNR failed to address the representativeness of the monitoring networkat expected maximum TSP impact sites. At a minimum, the WDNR should haveprovided a map showing both emission sources and monitor locations. Ifmonitors are not at worst-case locations, dispersion modeling should havebeen used to support the redesignation.Criterion 2Implementation of USEPA-approved control strategy_For areas designatednonattainment for TSP, a TSP SIP was required which satisfied the requirementsof section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA which involved providing for attainmentand maintenance of the TSP NAAQS. To redesignate an area to attainment,USEPA-approved control strategy (i.e., Wisconsin State Implementation Plan(SIP)) must have been implemented. The improvement in monitored readingsfor TSP (since the base year used for the nonattainment designation) mustbe attributable to enforceable or permanent emission reductions implementedsince that year. USEPA approved the Wisconsin TSP SIP for Oshkosh on October 5, 1978. However,WDNR did not discuss this plan in relationship to any air quality improvement.The WDNR should have discussed the reasons for the original secondary nonattainmentdesignation; the control strategies implemented which resulted in cleanerair; the federal enforceability of the control strategies; and the completeimplementation of the SIP (i.e., no sources out of compliance).The WDNR did cite the paving of unpaved lots and street sweeping as reasonsfor the improvement in the air quality. USEPA accepts paving as a permanentreduction. However, the WDNR should have noted the approximate number andlocation of the lots. Additionally, in USEPA's experience, street sweepinghas not always proven to be effective. WDNR must document the street sweepingprogram (i.e., schedule of sweeping, silt loadings, and permanency, etc.)before USEPA can assess the effectiveness of the street sweeping program.Criterion 3Permanent emission reductions_Emission reductions and improvement in airquality must not be temporary or merely the result of economic downturn.It must be shown that it is highly unlikely that emission rates will increasesignificantly at any units operating below their allowable emission rates(e.g., because economic, technological or regulatory factors would preventsuch increases). There must also be a showing that it is unlikely thatproduction levels will increase significantly.WDNR did not discuss how the air quality standard will be maintained inthe future. At a minimum, WDNR should have provided historical operatingrates and historical actual emissions for major sources and discuss whyemission increases are unlikely. Current allowable emissions should alsohave been provided. If sources are emitting at levels significantly belowtheir allowable limits, then a modeled attainment demonstration would berequired to demonstrate attainment if sources were to emit at allowablelevels in the future. For any permanent source shutdowns, WDNR should havedocumented that, if such a source were to start up in the future, the sourcewould be required to undergo new source review procedures.Criterion 4Dispersion techniques_Dispersion techniques, which are not creditable accordingto the revised section 123 regulations (50 FR 27892), cannot be responsiblefor the improvement in air quality.WDNR failed to address dispersion techniques. WDNR should have reviewedall TSP sources and documented that dispersion techniques were not responsiblefor the improvement in air quality.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>USEPA proposes to disapprove the redesignation request to attainment fromsecondary nonattainment for a sub-city area of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, becausethe WDNR did not adequately document the reasons for the air quality improvementin Oshkosh; nor did it document, or make a finding, as to whether currentair quality will be maintained.All interested persons are invited to submit written comment on the proposedredesignation. Written comments received by the date specified above willbe considered in determining whether USEPA will approve the redesignation.After review of all comments submitted, the Administrator of USEPA willpublish in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>the Agency's final action on the redesignation.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this proposed disapproval of Wisconsin'sredesignation request will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities because it applies only to a sub-cityarea of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and imposes no new requirements on anyone.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subject in 40 CFR Part 81</ITAG>Air pollution control, National Parks, Wilderness areas.<ITAG tagnum="21">Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 18, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Valdas V.
