Chung on Thursday confirmed its renewal during a lunch with TVwriters held by CBS News to help promote two specials titled,``Face To Face With Connie Chung.'' The first will be shown Monday;the second May 14.   Monday's show includes interviews with actor Gene Wilder, whodiscusses the death of his wife, Gilda Radner, from ovarian cancer,and with talk-show star Arsenio Hall.   Last fall, Chung's Saturday series drew sharp criticism for itsre-creations of news stories.   ``We don't have them (re-creations) on very often'' because theytake a long time to produce, she said Thursday. But she defendedre-creations, calling them ``a great way to tell a story when youcouldn't tell it any other way.''   Although she said she didn't know if her one-hour show wouldreturn to its Saturday time slot next fall, Andrew Lack, theprogram's executive producer, said that ``as far as I know, we'llbe back Saturday night at 10 p.m.''</TEXT></DOC>
