His relatives and friends marked the event with a flood ofmessages and with a Mass in Washington. Radio reports saidLebanon's three television stations would screen a birthday messagefrom his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome.   The daily newspapers An-Nahar and As-Safir and theFrench-language L'Orient-Le Jour published English texts of lettersto Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress who was abducted March 16, 1985.   His sister, Peggy Say, wrote, ``In honor of your birthday onFriday, we will be in Washington with other hostage families tomark another sad year in which you have been denied your freedom.''   The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, made up ofcolleagues from all over the United States, wrote: ``Please believethat not a day passes when we do not think of you and pray foryou.''   The Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan said it was sending a33-foot birthday scroll to Anderson signed by 59 journalists andformer colleagues in Tokyo.   Anderson was a member of the club during a working assignment inJapan 1979-1981.   Prominent journalists, along with representatives of the StateDepartment and the embassies of Lebanon, Algeria and Syria,attended a Mass in Georgetown University's Dahlgren Chapel, whereMrs. Say said such ceremonies ensure her brother will not beforgotten.   Gunmen seized the 42-year-old Anderson in Moslem west Beirutafter a game of tennis that had been a brief respite from hisreporting on Lebanon's civil war.   He has not held Sulome, born three months after the morning hewas kidnapped. He probably does not know that his father andbrother died of cancer.   Anderson's fate now appears to be caught up in a power strugglebetween Shiite Moslem radicals and moderates.   He was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad, a group loyal to Iran whosename means Islamic Holy War. His abductors demand the release of 15men imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassiesin 1983.   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, an American whowas acting dean of agriculture at American University of Beirut.Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985.   Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on thewhereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon.   Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year,reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for theircomrades jailed in Kuwait.   A copy of the statement delivered to a Western news agency inBeirut was accompanied by a photograph of Anderson similar to onereleased Nov. 4, 1988, after his last birthday.   The statement was seen as a response to a declaration Monday byPresident Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran that he would use itsinfluence to free the hostages if the United States releasedIranian assets worth up to $12 billion that have been frozen since1979.   Kuwait has refused to free the prsoners, but two members of thegroup were released in February after completing five-yearsentences. The United States has said it will not negotiate withterrorists.   Anderson and Sutherland are among eight American hostages, mostbelieved held by pro-Iranians.   Islamic Jihad issued its statement as the leader of Iran'srevolutionary radicals, former Interior Minister Ali AkbarMohtashemi, was on a three-week visit to Lebanon. He met withprominent Shiites, including leading figures in Hezbollah, believedto be the umbrella group for kidnap gangs.   It was not clear why Mohtashemi, Rafsanjani's main politicalrival, came to Lebanon. But the trip underlined his power strugglewith Rafsanjani, leader of the comparatively moderate``pragmatists'' who want to restore relations with the West.   A knowledgeable Shiite said privately the Islamic Jihadstatement was ``a clear indication that the hostage-holders are notunder Rafsanjani's control.''   Hezbollah appears to have split into factions, with the maingroups supporting either Rafsanjani or Mohtashemi.   Rafsanjani dismissed Mohtashemi after his election as presidentJuly 28. The former interior minister's surprise appearance inLebanon quashed reports from Tehran that he was under house arrest.Mohtashemi returned to Tehran on Wednesday via Damascus, Syria.   Since he was kidnapped, Anderson has been allowed to write a fewletters to his family and occasionally to see Lebanese newspaperand television reports about relatives.   American and French hostages who shared his captivity and werereleased have told of his courage and fears, how he has defied hiscaptors and suffered the agonies of captivity.   His father, Glenn, and elder brother, Glenn Jr., died of cancerin 1986. Released hostages said he did not know of the deaths.   Anderson knows his daughter, Sulome, was born June 7, 1985, buthas seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed himto watch on Lebanese TV, according to letters from him released bythe kidnappers.</TEXT></DOC>
