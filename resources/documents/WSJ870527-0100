The decision, by a 6-3 vote, is an important boost for law-enforcement officials, many of whom have argued for almost two decades in favor of pre-trial preventive detention, as the practice is called. It also is a victory for the Reagan administration, which defended the law.    But the American Civil Liberties Union said in a friend-of-the-court brief that preventive detention is a &quot;constitutional subterfuge&quot; aimed at &quot;imposing punishment without trial.&quot;    Traditionally, bail has been denied to accused persons most often in order to guarantee that they show up for trial or to stop them from intimidating judges, jurors, witnesses or prosecutors.    But in 1984, Congress approved preventive detention as part of an overhaul of the federal bail system. The law, which applies to the federal court system but not the states, requires a federal judge to hold a hearing to decide whether an accused person poses a threat to others or to the community. The accused is entitled to have a lawyer present, must be given written reasons for the detention, and may appeal the decision.    In a decision written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court said this form of custody is &quot;regulatory in nature, and doesn't constitute punishment before trial.&quot;    A federal appeals court in New York ruled last July that even if the preventive detention was regulatory in nature, rather than punishment, it still denied accused persons the &quot;due process of law&quot; they are guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.    But Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion, reversing the appeals court ruling, said that &quot;the government's regulatory interest in community safety can, in appropriate circumstances, outweigh an individual's liberty interest.&quot; The high court said the law doesn't violate either the due process guarantee or the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits &quot;excessive bail.&quot;    Justices Thurgood Marshall, William Brennan and John Stevens dissented.    The appeals court ruling was in favor of two reputed New York City Mafia leaders, Anthony Salerno and Vincent Cafaro, who had been denied bail by a federal district court judge after they had been charged with various racketeering offenses. The appeals court delayed the effect of its ruling, however, pending Supreme Court action in the case, and the two remained in jail. While the high court appeal was pending, Salerno was convicted in another racketeering trial in New York with seven other alleged crime bosses.    David Goldstein, an ACLU lawyer, said: &quot;What the court has done is to reverse the 200-year assumption of innocence and replace it with this vague notion of dangerousness.&quot;    Suing Labor Unions   The justices ruled that a worker who is injured on a job can't sue a union under state personal-injury laws for failing to assure a safe workplace, if the claim is based on a collective-bargaining agreement. The high court said such a claim against the union is covered by federal labor law, rather than state law.    By a 9-0 vote, the justices threw out the ruling of a federal appeals court in Atlanta, which allowed a lawsuit based on state law against the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The suit was filed by a woman injured while working for Florida Power andamp; Light Co., an FPL Group Inc. unit. Under Florida law, she could file only a worker's compensation claim against the company.    But she sued the union for damages for negligence in failing to provide a safe workplace. A lawsuit under state personal-injury law offers the possibility of collecting punitive damages, instead of being limited to actual losses under federal labor law.    In an opinion written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the high court said the lawsuit essentially was one that involved interpreting the union contract. The court sent the case back to the appeals court to decide whether the time period for filing the lawsuit under federal law has lapsed.    AZL Resources Appeal   The justices refused to hear an appeal by AZL Resources Inc., a Tosco Corp. unit, accused of securities fraud by former customers of Atlantic Financial Management Inc., an investment adviser that touted AZL stock in 1981 and 1982.    The lawsuit blamed the company for alleged securities fraud that occurred when its chairman, Maurice Strong, falsely suggested that an important merger was imminent for AZL. Atlantic Financial, which later collapsed, bought 650,000 shares of AZL for itself and its clients. But no merger occurred, and AZL stock plummeted.    The case hasn't gone to trial yet. The appeal involved the legal issue of whether a company can be held liable for the actions of its officials, even when those actions weren't expressly authorized and weren't for the benefit of the company. A federal appeals court in Boston ruled in February 1986 that a company may be held liable if its official acted with &quot;apparent authority.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
