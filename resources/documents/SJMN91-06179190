They alsoobjected to plans to remove about 100 to 150 supervisors from two unions.;   &quot;Nobody wants a strike,&quot; said Jim McGrath, media liaison for Local 1555 of theAmalgamated Transit Workers. &quot;But you can't take 100 of our members away fromus and not expect us to put up a fight.&quot;;    Bay Area Rapid Transit managersand employees still have room to maneuver. Their three-year contract does notexpire until midnight Sunday.;    &quot;We're continuing to negotiate,&quot; DeputyDistrict Manager John Haley said. &quot;We have until Sunday night to nail thisthing down, and everything's on the table until then.&quot;;    Even if thedeadline passes, union officials may decide to continue talks, according toLarry Gerber, chief negotiator for Local 790, which represents 1,386 clericaland maintenance employees.;    The two sides disagree over wages, healthbenefits and the proposal to eliminate the supervisors, according to McGrath.BART management is offering a 3 percent annual pay raise -- an amount manyworkers find acceptable during a recession -- but is also asking workers tobear a greater share of health costs. Taken together, the package will costworkers money.;    &quot;You'd end up paying more out of pocket than putting inpocket,&quot; Gerber said.;    Haley declined to comment on the specifics of thelatest offer.;    Another controversial issue centers on a union proposal toprovide lifetime benefits to the families of BART workers who die duringviolent crimes.;    The proposal, retroactive to June 30, 1990, would directlybenefit the daughter and grandchildren of BART Director Nello Bianco. Bianco'sson-in-law, Peter Martinelli, a BART employee, was shot to death June 28 whiledriving his family to Lake Tahoe.;    A similar proposal was introduced -- andrescinded -- last year after many people objected. Fremont BART Director JohnGlenn does not like its new form any better.;    &quot;It was a shock to me,&quot; Glennsaid. &quot;It got inserted by (Bianco's) union buddies. I can't accept somethinglike this.&quot;;    Bianco could not be reached for comment.;    BART workers lastwent on strike in 1979, when they shut down the rail line for five weeks.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  FRANCES DINKELSPIEL, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910627  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  519  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 27, 199100179190,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
