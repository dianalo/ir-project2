The measure would end the strike and create a specialthree-member panel to resolve remaining contract disputesbetween eight rail unions and 11 major railroads. Thecontract talks broke off late Tuesday, prompting a nationwidewalkout of about 200,000 rail workers yesterday morning.</LP><TEXT>   The measure was passed in quick succession last night bythe House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously, the fullHouse on a 400-5 vote, and the Senate without debate.President Bush is expected to sign the measure.   The new panel, which will use the earlier recommendationsof a presidential emergency board as a starting point, wouldbe empowered to make binding decisions to settle any issuesthat the parties couldn't resolve through further collectivebargaining. The board and both sides would have 65 days toresolve any remaining issues.   Clearly uncomfortable with having to decide an issue thatthe railroads, the unions, the National Mediation Board and apresidential emergency board haven't been able to settle forthree years, members of Congress avoided imposing asettlement. But mindful of the strike's effects on a shakyeconomy, lawmakers were also eager to get the trains runningagain.   The administration estimated that the strike would costthe U.S. economy $50 million a day, with the daily costrising to $637 million if the strike lasts more than twoweeks, and $1 billion after four weeks. &quot;It's a seriousconcern to an economy that's in recession,&quot; said MichaelBoskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. &quot;Abouta third of all goods are shipped by rail.&quot; In the fourthquarter, the gross national product, a tally of production ofall goods and services, was about $15 billion a day.   Though a strike clearly could hurt the economy, economistssaid rail transport is less vital than it was several yearsago. &quot;Rail-car loadings were 27 million in 1970 and about 22million in 1990, in a much larger economy,&quot; said DavidRolley, an economist with the consulting firm Data ResourcesInc., Lexington, Mass. Trucking is making up much of thedifference, he said.   A presidential emergency board had recommended asettlement covering such items as wages and work-rulechanges. While Congress has typically enacted suchrecommendations in the past to settle railroad labordisputes, House Democrats aren't inclined to enact thisreport, which many unions consider unacceptable.   Putting it bluntly in a hearing by a House subcommittee onthe matter yesterday, Rep. Dennis Eckart (D., Ohio), said,&quot;Efforts to slam dunk or force feed the {emergency board}report down anybody's throats ain't going nowhere.&quot;   The new legislation could give unions another crack atreaching compromises that would displease them less than theemergency board's report, or at least take union leaders offthe hook from accepting work-rules changes without a bigfight.   The three members of the special panel would be appointedby the president. One would be a member of the emergencyboard and the two others would be chosen from a list ofarbitrators compiled by the National Mediation Board. Thepanel would consider only issues for which the emergencyboard made recommendations and on which the two sidesdisagree.   In the new panel's deliberations, there would be apresumption of validity for the emergency board'srecommendations. The unions or the railroads would have theburden of showing why any of those recommendations isn'tvalid and should be modified.   Many unions have said that the emergency board'srecommendations would mean wage cuts, in effect, because ofwork-rules changes such as progressively longer mileage toreceive a day's pay and moves toward more crew-sizereductions.   Mac Fleming, president of the Brotherhood of Maintenanceof Way Employees, said the board report &quot;is so skewed tomanagement's side, that . . . the carriers have no incentiveto conduct meaningful negotiations.&quot; According to Mr.Fleming, the recommendations would mean a 16% cut ininflation-adjusted wages over the life of the contract, whileproducing &quot;intolerable working conditions&quot; and eliminatingjobs. He and other union leaders called for a special reviewboard.   The Association of American Railroads says the averageannual wage for a rail worker is $42,809, but unions say thatfigure is greatly overstated.   Testifying before the House subcommittee yesterday,Secretary Skinner espoused the administration -- and railroadindustry -- view that Congress should simply enact theemergency board recommendations as the only realisticsolution at this point.   But Mr. Skinner said he wasn't drawing &quot;a line in thesand,&quot; and showed a possible willingness to consider adifferent approach. Some kind of &quot;process&quot; is needed toresolve ambiguities in the complex report, Mr. Skinner said,&quot;with some issues to be put off until the future.&quot;   Railroad companies also argued that Congress should justadopt the emergency board's report. Michael Walsh, chairmanof the Union Pacific railroad, praised the board's work as&quot;unprecedented in its mandate and scope.&quot; He noted, forexample, that it urged a 130-mile work day -- half-waybetween the railroad's favored 160 miles and the unions' pleato roll back the current 108-mile standard to the 100 milesthat prevailed in 1917.   ---   Paul Duke Jr. contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
