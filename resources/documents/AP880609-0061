The report by the government-sponsored Committee on MedicalAspects of Radiation in the Environment says six known cases ofleukemia were diagnosed among young people under 24 who livedwithin 15 miles of the plant in Dounreay between 1968 and 1984.   ``This is twice the number expected on the basis of the nationalrate,'' the report says, adding that the likelihood of such a highrate occurring by chance is about one in 12.   Five of the victims lived within 7.8 miles of the nuclearcomplex, the center for Britain's fast-breeder reactor researchprogram, the study says.   The report says the reason for the number of leukemia cases isnot known, though the findings echo a 1986 government investigationshowing the childhood leukemia rate near the Sellafield nuclearreprocessing plant in Cumbria, northwest England, to be four timesthe national average.   ``It is hard to imagine that you could see an excess aroundDounreay and an excess around Sellafield, and it is just badluck,'' said commission chairman Martin Bobrow.   The committee said it was ``conceivable that minute amounts ofradioactive material carried home may accumulate and lead toexposure of infants in some unforeseen way.''   But it said the level of leukemia might also be due to exposureto chemicals, viruses or even chance.   Scottish Health Minister Michael Forsyth said the government hadaccepted the committee's recommendation to hold an investigationinto the high rates, despite the``small number of cases involved.''   However, union spokesman Bryan Durrans of the Institute ofProfessional Civil Servants called the report ``inconclusive.''   ``If most of us thought anything was likely to happen to ourchildren or families, we would not be here.'' he said.   The Dounreay complex employs 2,100 workers in a barren area ofNorthern Scotland that offers little alternative employment.   The environmental group Friends of the Earth lauded the reportas the first government admission of a link between leukemia andnuclear emissions, and called for an immediate closure of both theDounreay and Sellafield plants.   ``The nuclear industry has finally been implicated in causingcancers _ something it has denied for years,'' said spokesmanStewart Boyle.   Leukemia clusters _ occurrences of the disease statisticallyhigher than normal _ have also been found in southern England nearthe Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, the Royal OrdnanceFactory and the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority.   In each case, scientists in the nuclear industry argued thatrecorded emissions of radiation were not high enough to account forhigher rates of the radiation-linked disease.   The national leukemia rate is eight cases per 100,000 people.</TEXT></DOC>
