If the Arab rivals settle their differences the results would bemore violence against Israel, isolation of Jordan and the end ofthe U.S. peace plan for the Middle East, already criticized by bothIsraelis and Arabs, the analysts predicted.   One said he did not expect the reconciliation to last becausedistrust between Arafat and Assad ``is so profound.''   The two met on Monday in Damascus, capital of Syria. Syrian andPalestinian sources said they discussed the U.S. peace plan and theArab rebellion that began nearly five months ago in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   It was Arafat's first visit to Damascus since Syria expelled himJune 24, 1983, during a mutiny against his leadership by PLOfactions backed by Assad.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel's response to themeeting would be to heighten its alert along its borders and in theWest Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied since the 1967Arab-Israeli war.   Since the rebellion in the territories began Dec. 8,Palestinians have tried 11 times to enter Israel from Lebanon. Inthe latest attempt Tuesday, two Israeli soldiers and threeguerrillas were killed.   ``Whenever you have an Arab consensus, it will always bedirected against the security of Israel,'' Shamir said on Israelradio. ``Therefore, we have to be vigilant.''   According to the analysts, the reconciliation effort wasprompted by Assad's desire for more influence in the occupiedterritories, where most Palestinians support the PalestineLiberation Organization, and by Arafat's need for free movement forhis fighters in Lebanon.   Syria has 25,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the main powerbroker in a nation factionalized by 13 years of civil war.   A significant element in Arafat's decision was the weakening ofhis mainstream Fatah movement by the assassination April 16 of hisdeputy Khalil Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad, military analystZeev Schiff said in an interview.   Wazir, who was buried in Damascus last week, was popular withboth Arafat loyalists and pro-Syrian PLO dissidents.   Israeli sources have said Israeli commandos killed Wazir, butthe government has not acknowledged it.   ``The Abu Jihad killing hurt Arafat's supporters and may havebeen an impetus for this meeting,'' said Schiff, a correspondentfor the daily Haaretz. ``Arafat wants to appear more radical. Thismeeting shows the PLO leader is like a pendulum, moving from oneposition to another.''   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said either Syria or the PLO mustcompromise if an alliance was to be achieved and Assad would notmoderate his position.   Instead, ``the Syrians will demand from him (Arafat) extremepositions that will pull him away from Jordan, from Egypt,'' Rabinpredicted on Israel television.   Yossi Olmert, a Middle East specialist at Tel Aviv University,said a PLO-Syrian alliance probably would isolate King Hussein ofJordan because he is more moderate than Assad and willing todiscuss solutions to the Middle East conflict.   Olmert said the meeting also was bad news for the United States.   ``This is the last nail in the coffin of the U.S. peaceproposal,'' he said. ``It's yet another insurmountable difficultyfor Secretary of State (George P.) Shultz, at least at thisjuncture.''   In predicting the Arafat-Assad alliance would collapse, he said:``The PLO and Syria ... both want to keep pressure on Israel fromthe territories and from Lebanon, and they both are not eager tomake concessions for peace.   ``But even though we see them kissing now, at the end of the daySyrian suspicion of the PLO and PLO distrust of Syria is soprofound that I can't see how it can last.''   He and others predicted the short-term impact of theArafat-Assad meeting would be negative.   ``The `Sulha in Damascus' will fuel further unrest in theterritories,'' correspondent Uzi Machnaimi wrote in the dailyYediot Ahronot, using the Arabic word for a reconciliation meeting.   Palestinians in the occupied lands applauded the meeting.   ``We Palestinians have been waiting for this moment,'' saidElias Freij, a Palestinian Christian who favors Jordan and is mayorof Bethlehem.   Former Mayor Bassam Shakaa of Nablus said: ``The PLO-Syrianreconciliation will double the power of the uprising. The fightingspirit of the Palestinians will soar.''</TEXT></DOC>
