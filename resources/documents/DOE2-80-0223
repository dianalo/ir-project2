After present obsolescence diagnosis techniques are outlined,as examples, the self diagnosis system of the remote monitoring and controlequipment installed on a pole with a switch, the obsolescence diagnosissystem capable of always monitoring the gas pressure of an undergroundautomatic gas-blast load-break switch from a service station, and thefacility management system alternative to facility ledgers, which isone of the subsystems of a total distribution management system underdeveloping, are presented. After present fault localization techniquesare outlined, as examples, the pole over current ground indicator (OGI)which displays the presence of fault locations on customer side by detectingfault current and voltage, the underground ground indicator (GI) whichdisplays the presence of ground fault on customer side by comparing betweenthe phases of zero-phase voltage and curent, and the thunderbolt previewsystem composed of a weather radar system and alarm system capable ofdetecting the surge voltage induced on distribution lines are presented.(11 figs, 1 photo)</TEXT></DOC>
