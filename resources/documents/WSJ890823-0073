The deficit continued a two-year string of multibillion-dollar losses, and showed the industry's performance worsened from a $3.5 billion loss in the first quarter. The loss narrowed, however, against last year's second quarter, when the loss totaled $4.1 billion.    In other action, regulators said they intend to honor rates on certificates of deposits issued by insolvent savings and loans under their control, or whose deposits and assets are sold to buyers. Buyers who only purchase the deposits of a thrift and not its assets -- relatively rare and minor transactions -- may pay off the CDs early. The regulators were seeking to address concerns that the sometimes unusually high rates generally wouldn't be honored in order to bring down the cost of the thrift bailout plan.    The OTS said two large California associations taken over earlier this year by regulators had losses of $1 billion together and were a major factor in the overall results.    Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan, based in Irvine, Calif., had a $788 million loss -- the biggest of any thrift in the quarter -- and Gibraltar Savings, Beverly Hills, had a $332 million loss. Non-operating losses were $460 million at Lincoln and $280 million at Gibraltar, a sign that regulators found overvalued assets on the thrifts' books and marked them down to market value, James Barth, OTS chief economist, said.    The signing of the thrift rescue bill two weeks ago won't stem the losses immediaely, partly because for the next several quarters regulators will be writing down assets and selling off perhaps 500 other insolvent thrifts. Mr. Barth said he &quot;wouldn't be surprised&quot; if a third-quarter loss matched that of the second quarter.    The OTS said 232 insolvent savings and loans taken over by the government this year -- but which remained open because regulators didn't have the funds to sell them or pay off depositors -- had losses of $3.2 billion in the second quarter. The OTS operates under the Treasury Department.    The losses at Lincoln and Gibraltar helped put the total loss in the San Francisco Home Loan Bank district, which also includes Nevada and Arizona, at $1.5 billion, following earnings of $17 million in the first quarter. Thrifts in the Dallas Home Loan Bank district, though, had the highest total loss in the quarter, $1.6 billion. That district includes New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.    Typical of the past several quarters, the industry was divided into two segments: 2,533 solvent thrifts had a total net income of $334 million, while 401 insolvent thrifts had losses totaling $4 billion.    But Mr. Barth said all thrifts had been hurt by paying higher interest rates to draw deposits. Thrifts are generally hurt more than banks by rising interest rates because the associations make longer-term loans and thus can't adjust the rates they charge as quickly as banks.    The cost of funds, which includes the rates thrifts pay for Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and other advances, increased to 8.38% from 7.88% in the first quarter. The highest rate in the second quarter was in the San Francisco Home Loan Bank district, where the cost of funds jumped to 8.75% from 8.09% in the first quarter.    The second-quarter loss also hurt the industry's capital position, leaving tangible capital at $15.5 billion, or 1.15% of assets, measured by generally accepted accounting principles. It was a decline from $19.2 billion, or 1.43%, at the end of the first quarter.    Under the savings-and-loan bailout law, thrifts must currently meet a 1.5% tangible capital ratio and reach 3% by the end of 1994. Thrifts that don't meet the criteria must submit a business plan to regulators detailing how they will raise capital.    Separately, officials of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created to merge or sell ailing savings and loans, sought to clear up confusion over its policy on honoring certificate-of-deposit rates at thrifts it takes over. The officials said they have no plans to pay off early those CDs earning unusually high rates in the 264 thrifts now in its conservatorship program.    However, when the RTC transfers a broke thrift's deposits to another institution -- in contrast to a sale of the whole thrift, including assets -- the acquirer may pay off CDs early if it wishes.    David Cooke, RTC executive director, said the agency follows the same policy as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which handles bank failures. There had been some concern that the RTC, which is operated by the FDIC, might pay off high-interest CDs early to bring down costs quickly at the thrifts it is overseeing. But Mr. Cooke said, &quot;We have no plans to sever deposit contracts in the conservatorship program.&quot;    &quot;If we break contracts there's some question what effect that will have on the funding markets,&quot; Mr. Cooke said, referring to suggestions that not honoring CD rates might prompt investors to demand even higher rates because of possible risk.    Rather than paying off CDs early, the RTC plans to use most of the $20 billion it will spend by the end of next month replacing high-cost deposits in thrifts as they mature. The RTC said yesterday it had already injected $921 million into 11 ailing savings and loans. </TEXT></DOC>
