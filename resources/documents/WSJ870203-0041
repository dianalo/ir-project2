But their former parent, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., lambasted the department as anti-competitive and anti-consumer. So did a coalition of big telephone customers, labor, consumers and others.    Thus the stage was set for more major battles in Washington this year by the Baby Bells, which want flexibility to expand their role in American business, and by their opponents, which want to block that expansion.    The department urged federal Judge Harold Greene, who enforces the accord under which the Bell System was broken up, to permit the regional concerns to offer computerized services and long-distance calling and to make telephone equipment. Under terms of the 1984 breakup, they are banned from those areas.    &quot;We are very happy with the recommendations,&quot; said Zane E. Barnes, chairman and chief executive officer of Southwestern Bell Corp., St. Louis. In Atlanta, John L. Clendenin, chairman and chief executive of BellSouth Corp., called the action &quot;a step in the right direction.&quot;    Chicago-based Ameritech's chairman and chief executive, William Weiss, said the action represents a &quot;move forward in the direction of where the information and telecommunications industries ought to go.&quot; In Philadelphia, Thomas E. Bolger, chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic Corp., said, &quot;It is a giant step forward in bringing benefits of full competition to the public.&quot;    New York-based Nynex Corp., San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group and Englewood, Colo.-based U S West Inc. also welcomed the recommendations.    The seven were particularly happy with the department's stance on computerized services and manufacturing, which recommended removal of all limits on the companies' involvement in those businesses. Ending those restrictions &quot;will give us a chance to maximize the use of our (telephone) network and central offices,&quot; said Southwestern Bell's Mr. Barnes.    The companies have long argued that it is uneconomical and inefficient for their multibillion-dollar networks and computerized central-office switches to exist and not be used in more and different ways.    If Judge Greene heeds the recommendations, the companies still couldn't introduce computerized services quickly, because the Federal Communications Commission has yet to complete numerous guidelines related to that market. For example, the FCC currently is developing with the industry rules to ensure that non-Bell information vendors have fair access to the Bell companies' network.    All seven companies were cautious in predicting whether Judge Greene would heed the recommendations. &quot;It is too early to predict what will happen,&quot; said Mr. Bolger of Bell Atlantic. &quot;However, the strength of the (Justice Department's) report should weigh very importantly on any decision by the court.&quot; And a decision probably will take several months. &quot;This isn't like the sun is going to rise tomorrow morning and it will be a new bright world,&quot; Ameritech's Mr. Weiss said.    Judge Greene certainly will have to weigh a flood of arguments against the recommendations, which were immediately and harshly criticized from several quarters.    &quot;Three years ago, the Justice Department broke up the finest telecommunications business in the world -- the Bell System,&quot; ATandamp;T said in a statement. &quot;Now that same Justice Department wants to change the rules again and risk re-creating the chaos and gridlock that characterized the industry just a few short years ago.&quot; ATandamp;T raised the specter of renewed controversies and antitrust litigation. &quot;Customers, investors and employees would go back to square one,&quot; the company said.    In Washington, MCI Communications Corp., the second-largest long-distance company after ATandamp;T, characterized the Justice Department's move as &quot;a flagrant attempt to overturn the nation's antitrust laws&quot; and said the agency has &quot;flip-flopped.&quot;    In Kansas City, Mo., US Sprint Communications Co. said it will &quot;submit our comments very soon to Judge Greene.&quot; A spokesman said US Sprint has previously taken the position that Bell operating companies shouldn't be permitted to enter the interstate long-distance market, &quot;even with some limitations.&quot; US Sprint is jointly owned by GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc.    The agency's stance &quot;sets the stage for a major fight, with seven companies and a handful of government administrators on one side and the rest of the industry on the other,&quot; said Brian Moir, the Washington representative for a coalition of consumer groups, big phone users, labor and others. He said his group would take their battle to Capitol Hill and to Judge Greene's court. &quot;We had come to expect better from the Justice Department in recent years,&quot; he said.    The regional companies said they expected the reaction and didn't expect their opponents to accept the recommendations without a fight. Calling ATandamp;T's reaction &quot;harsh rhetoric,&quot; Southwestern Bell's Mr. Barnes said that &quot;everyone wants to protect their own positions, including Southwestern Bell. A lot of interested parties are going to take strong positions on all of these issues.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
