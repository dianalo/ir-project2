The announcement was delivered 45 minutes before the 10 p.m. (3p.m. EDT) deadline set for Cicippio's death. It was the secondmessage today from the Revolutionary Justice Organization. Earlier,it released a statement announcing Cicippio's death sentence hadbeen put off from 6 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT) to 10 p.m.   The latest statement was delivered to a Western news agency inBeirut, along with an instant photograph of Cicippio, looking intothe camera with the trace of a smile on his face.   ``Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and stateswith whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, wedeclare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitutionwith an initiative,'' said the 14-line Arabic statement.   It demanded that Israel release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, aShiite Moslem cleric kidnapped Friday by Israeli commandos, as wellas Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held in Israel. Lists ofthem are to be prepared later and presented to the Red Cross, itsaid.   Previously, the group had only demanded freedom for Obeid andtwo companions seized with him.   ``Acceptance should be announced within days, otherwise theinitiative will be considered canceled,'' said the handwrittenmessage. It did not say if the death sentence would then berestored.   Earlier today, Israel said it would not free Obeid until Israelisoldiers and foreigners held in Lebanon are freed.   That was in response to the earlier Revolutionary Justicemessage, which included a videotape on which Cicippio reading astatement appealing for freedom for Obeid.   The group has put off the death order three times since Tuesday.   Earlier today, the White House said President Bush had notdecided whether to take military action if Cicippio was killed.   U.S. warships were reported moving toward the Mediterranean, butthe Pentagon said today the moves were nothing unusual.   A Shiite Moslem leader threatened a ``ruthless'' reprisal in theevent of a U.S. attack.   U.N. envoy Marrack Goulding was in Lebanon searching for thebody of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. Goulding toldABC's ``Good Morning America'' that some people told him Higginsmay still be alive.   A Shiite Moslem group claimed it killed Higgins on Monday toavenge Israel's refusal to release Obeid.   ``I appeal to each person having honor who can move to releaseSheik Abdul Karim Obeid ... Don't be late, because they (thecaptors) are very serious,'' said the statement Cicippio on thevideotape released earlier today.   Cicippio, with a bushy beard, was shown from the waist up. Hewas wearing eyeglasses and a blue track suit and looked haggard anddistressed. The statement's poor English suggested his captorswrote it.   ``So to help me move, I demand from the American people, obligeIsrael to release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid immediately because hiskidnapping is not human,'' Cicippio said, reading slowly.   ``We the American people are always the victims of Israel'spolitics, and President Bush has not helped to free us.''   Cicippio, choked with emotion, ended the statement with amessage for his Lebanese wife, Elham.   ``Goodbye, my wife. If you don't hear my voice and see my faceagain I want you to look after yourself and don't be sad and alwaysremember me.''   The kidnappers' handwritten statement accompanying the videosaid in Arabic: ``In response to Cicippio's request to delay theexecution until 10 p.m., in the hope that his appeal would befruitful and useful, it has been decided to grant a delay in thenew deadline.''   A Shiite source noted that Revolutionary Justice has threatenedto kill hostages in the past but is not known to have carried outthe threats.   Israel has offered to trade Obeid for three Israeli soldiers andforeign hostages in Lebanon. The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, of whichObeid is reputed to be a member, rejected a swap.   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for factions holdingmost of the 16 foreign hostages in Lebanon. The captives includeeight Americans.   Yossi Ben Aharon, a senior aide to Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir, today said Israel was not changing its policy onObeid. ``We took this gentleman for purpose of release of our threeprisoners, and this remains the objective,'' he said.   Cicippio, 58, of Norristown, Pa., was acting comptroller of theAmerican University of Beirut when he was abducted Sept. 12, 1986.   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Earlier today, U.N. envoy Marrack Goulding held a closed-doorsession in Beirut with Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,Hezbollah's spiritual guide.   In south Beirut, where most of the hostages are believed held,Sheik Abbas Mousawi, a senior Hezbollah leader, said his group'sresponse would be ``ruthless'' if the United States took militaryaction.   ``President Bush must think a million times before embarking onsuch a reckless adventure. I don't think he has forgotten thetruck-bombing of the American marine base at Beirut airport,''Mousawi said, referring to the 1983 attack that killed 241 U.S.servicemen at a military base in Lebanon.   Pentagon officials said the USS Belknap, flagship of the U.S.6th Fleet, and the fleet commander canceled a visit to the Sovietcity of Sevastopol in case Bush needs them, but that a militarystrike was unlikely. The aircraft carrier America cut short a visitto Singapore and headed to the Mediterranean.   Goulding, interviewed by telephone by ABC, said he had met twoShiite leaders and the charge d'affairs of the Iranian Embassytoday.   ``Some of them have told me that Col. Higgins is probably dead,others have said to me they think he may still be alive. And I prayto God the latter group is right,'' he said.   ``Let me make clear that my mission is not confined to Col.Higgins only,'' he added. `` But I'm also here to say whether theU.N. can do anything to get under control the hostage crisis.''</TEXT></DOC>
