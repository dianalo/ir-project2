But Mexico has to determine whether it can overcome its politicalconcerns about dealing in the U.S. energy market. If it should be ableto do that, then, as the author emphasizes, the U.S. gas market is stillone in which the larger foreign supplier is Canada. Mexico has to meetthe Canadian competition. There are other aspects to the importance ofMexico which should bear heavily on U.S. perspectives and which go farbeyond gas trade itself. While mutually successful gas trade could benefitboth countries, it cannot, probably, be as important to Mexico's prospectsas its oil. Nevertheless, U.S. interest in Mexico's well-being is basedon very solid considerations of national interest. To the extent thatfor reasons of a burgeoning growth in Mexican needs for revenue, gastrade with the United States could commence in earnest, the agenda ofissues between the two countries would be shorter.</TEXT></DOC>
