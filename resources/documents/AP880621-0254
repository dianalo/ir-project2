A Senate appropriations subcommittee late Monday approvedspending $5.5 million to purchase 5,017 acres at the southern tipof the Texas Gulf Coast island.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will buy the land at costfrom the Texas Nature Conservancy, and when the deal goes throughall the land on the island will be in either federal or stateownership, according to the office of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.   But a Gramm staffer said it still is unclear how the land willbe managed, with debate centering on whether it should be the stateor federal government or both. The state controls 24,893 acres, andwhen the final purchase goes through, the federal government willcontrol 30,502 acres.   As the whooping crane flock grows, some of the endangered birdshave wintered on Matagorda Island rather than at the Aransas refuge.   ``This is going to preserve and protect their habitat fromdevelopment,'' said Giezentanner. ``There are only two barrierislands in Texas that are not developed to some degree _ Matagordaand (adjacent) San Jose.''   More than 230 species of birds can be found on Matagorda Island,including endangered song birds who make the island their firstlandfall upon their northern spring migration from South America,Giezentanner said. A total of 20 endangered species of birds usethe island.   He said 132 whooping cranes wintered last year at the Aransasrefuge or nearby, including Matagorda Island. Two other members ofthe flock also spent the winter in Texas _ a record high since theearly 1930s.   The record low was in 1941, when 15 of the birds spent thewinter in Texas and six others in Louisiana, he said.   Of the 134 whooping cranes that left Wood Buffalo National Parkin the Northwest Terrorities, Canada, for Texas last fall, 25 werefledged birds _ those just able to fly _ and all made the 2,500 to2,800-mile journey.</TEXT></DOC>
