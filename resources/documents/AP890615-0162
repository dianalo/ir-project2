Key provisions would speed drug-related evictions and seizeapartments of alleged dealers and users. Those elements have beencriticized by tenants' rights groups as not providing adequate legalprotection for the accused.   ``As we aggressively pursue our objectives to eradicate drugsfrom our housing programs we will not do so at the expense ofindividual tenants' rights,'' he added in a written statement.   He said his Department of Housing and Urban Development isreviewing each state's judicial structure as it relates to evictionto ensure individual rights are protected.   HUD has granted exemptions from the agency's administrativegrievance procedures in evictions of alleged drug dealers and usersin public housing in Virginia, Massachuestts, New York and theDistrict of Columbia.   Public housing managers said federal regulations which requiredlocal government officials to allow tenants threatened with evictionto appeal to agency administrative panels and then to courts slowedevictions by as much as a year.   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., questioned how he would envisionhandling the case of the possible eviction of a single mother orgrandmother living in public housing with a drug-selling teen-agershe feared.   ``You cannot have one policy that will cover every singlecondition in public housing,'' Kemp said, adding eviction actionswould have to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.   However, Kemp said he wanted to give public housing authoritiesthe power to ``to remove the guilty and protect the needy.''   Kemp also cited the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as legislationthat has hampered his anti-drug efforts.   The law makes it illegal for any recipient of federal money todiscriminate based on ``mental and physical impairments,'' andincludes drug and alcohol dependent persons among those defined asbeing legally handicapped.   As a result, Kemp said public housing which gives priority to thedisabled would have to include such people.   ``In my view the drug user should not be put at the top of thewaiting list for public housing,'' said Kemp.   Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., has introduced legislation to excludedrug addicts and alcohol-dependent persons from those protected bythe 1973 law.   Other aspects of HUD's plan plan for drug-free public housingwould tighten security, reclaim vacant units and deny access to drugdealers, encourage resident management and homeownership, establishan anti-drug hotline at HUD for residents to anonymously reportdrug-related activities, terminate housing assistance of thoseconvicted of drug crimes and provide money for athletic programs inpublic housing.   Kemp offered no figures on the total cost of the program.   Meanwhile, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., head of theAppropriations subcommittee on HUD and independent agencies, told ameeting of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities thesecretary's anti-drug effort was initiated to show that thegovernment wanted to be a good landlord.   ``The point has been made. Now the point has to be turned intodollars,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
