Hissecond novel, a critic wrote, should be read by anyone wanting tounderstand the Japanese.   With his third novel, ``The Remains of the Day,'' the35-year-old novelist has turned his eye on his adopted country withan imaginative tour de force built around that most British ofinstitutions, the butler.   Like Jeeves, that other famous butler of fiction, Mr. Stevens ofDarlington Hall is a proud perfectionist. But there any resemblanceends. This is no P.J. Wodehouse farce but a somber, disturbing talethat has harvested ecstatic reviews plus this year's Booker Prize,Britain's most prestigious literary award.   Ishiguro's achievement is all the greater for the fact that hewrites of a Japan he has not seen since he was 5 and of an Englandthat died a generation before him.   At 35, this Nagasaki-born scion of samurai lineage is athoroughly modern Englishman, right down to the soft south Londonaccent. He writes in English, and says his Japanese is too poor forconversation with other Japanese. But he keeps a photo of himselfas a 10-month-old baby pictured beside the family samurai swords,and his prose has the subtlety and understatement one associateswith a Japanese watercolor.   He can vaguely remember grown-ups mentioning genshibakudan, theatomic bomb, but only now is he paying a visit to Japan, his firstsince his oceanographer father brought the family to England in1954 and settled in Guildford, a comfortably middle-class townsouthwest of London.   At school, Ishiguro recalls, ``I learned to use myconspicuousness to make myself very popular. They didn't knowwhether I should be hero-worshiped or stigmatized.'' He ended up``kind of mascotized.''   He backpacked through Europe and North America and did odd jobs,including a season as a fieldhand on royal grouse hunts. He wantedto be a rock musician, but ended up at novelist Malcolm Bradbury'screative writing department at the University of East Anglia.   He published some short stories, then a novel, ``A Pale View ofHills.'' In 1986 came his dazzling second novel, ``An Artist of theFloating World,'' set in 1950s Japan.   ``We are seeing here the emergence of one of the masters ofcontemporary English writing. And if you want to start tounderstand the Japanese, begin here,'' wrote Paul Barker in TheFinancial Times.   The novel told of a respected painter coming to terms with hisless-than-glorious World War II years as a propaganda artist forJapanese militarists.   ``The Remains of the Day'' is also about old men's regrets _ inthis case the butler's recognition that Lord Darlington, thegentleman he served with utter devotion, was a well-meaning butwholly misguided sympathizer with Nazi Germany and a pawn in thehands of Hitler's ambassador to Britain, Joachim von Ribbentrop.   The story begins in 1956. Darlington Hall has passed with itsbutler to an American owner, Mr. Farraday, who kindly lends Stevenshis car and sends him off on a motoring holiday through westernEngland.   As he drives, Stevens reflects on his life as a butler in the1930s, and gradually his shell of professional reserve peels awayto reveal truth after shattering truth:   Here is a man so duteous that he kept serving drinks even thoughaware that his father was dying upstairs; who was deeply loved bythe housekeeper but never realized it, and anyway, believedmarriage among servants disrupted household duties; who withoutdemur fired two Jewish maids because his lordship thought it was agood idea; who was deluded enough to believe he was contributing toworld peace by serving the correct wines to the British and Germanguests who would gather at Darlington Hall to plot the appeasementof Hitler.   Stevens' shame is not that he was pro- or anti-Nazi, but that henever had an opinion either way, so blinded was he by duty.   ``You see, I trusted,'' he tells a stranger when he finallyfaces up to the truth. ``I trusted in his lordship's wisdom. Allthose years I served him, I trusted I was doing somethingworthwhile.''   Thus Ishiguro neatly reverses the cliche of ``what the butlersaw'' by building a novel around what the butler didn't see, andposes a crucial question for democracies everywhere: How areordinary citizens to make up their own minds, when ``a group ofpeople can shout for a long time, `we know what we're doing, justtrust us,' and most of us in this country are in a helplessposition. We just don't know enough to argue back.''   Another achievement of ``The Remains of the Day'' is that intelling his story entirely in Stevens's voice, Ishiguro displays anear-flawless ear for butler language.   Stevens is fussy, buttoned-up, comical, even exasperating. Hereflects on the English countryside's calm beauty (so different tothe ``unseemly demonstrativeness'' of American and Africanlandscapes); on the essence of butlering (``Not (to) be shaken outby external events, however surprising''); or the importance ofproperly polishing the silver (``the state of the silver had made asmall, but significant contribution towards the easing of relationsbetween Lord Halifax and Herr Ribbentrop that evening.'')   He has trouble with his American master's little jokes andteasings, and takes to studying a humorous radio program for tips,``because the witticisms performed on it are always in the best oftaste and, to my mind, of a tone not at all out of keeping with thesort of bantering Mr. Farraday might expect on my part.''   Japanese and English societies share rigid structures thatinvite comparison, but Ishiguro resists the temptation. He can seemuch that is ``strange, bizarre and exotic'' in England, butrecognizes he must seem equally strange to the Japanese, who, hesuspects, are ``slightly baffled, fascinated and probably slightlythreatened'' by him because ``multiculturalism is something they'renot used to.''   But ``culturally, people are increasingly becoming a mixture ofthings,'' he says. ``I'm an obvious example of that.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Dec. 15-17</NOTE></DOC>
