PerryStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Whatever happens in the turbulent financial markets in the days and weeks ahead, the political fallout will help the Democrats as they enter the 1988 presidential campaign.    &quot;The Democrats have been talking for years about danger out there,&quot; says William Schneider, political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;Now the brush fire is really getting closer. The day of reckoning is at hand.&quot;    Monday's crash took place more than a year before Election Day, raising the possibility that good times might return in time to boost the Republicans, who in the Reagan era have sought to portray themselves as the party of prosperity. Just the same, many voters may find it hard to forget the shock of this week's events, and if the nation plunges into a serious recession, Democrats would be positioned to reap immense political advantages.    Such an event, moreover, might also increase the chances that the party would turn to a candidate who represents the old New Deal coalition, which so far hasn't played a major role in the party's 1988 nomination struggle.    Hours after the crash, Democratic candidates began pointing fingers at Republican mismanagement of the economy. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, for instance, called for &quot;immediate consultation&quot; with the U.S.'s financial allies. &quot;We cannot afford to have competitive beggar-thy-neighbor policies in our exchange markets,&quot; he said.    Democrats have known all along that their best chance to win back the White House would come with an economic downturn. They won that way four times in this century -- 1912, 1932, 1960 and 1976.    &quot;The Democrats,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican political theorist, &quot;stand to be the major beneficiaries if they can find someone who can be credible in a time of economic crisis. Historically that's been the Democratic advantage.&quot;    And if there's going to be a recession in the next few months, voters will have no problem apportioning blame. This will be President Reagan's recession, and GOP efforts to blame Congress almost surely won't work.    If the economic situation deteriorates, Kansas Sen. Robert Dole could be the principal beneficiary among the Republican presidential candidates. Mr. Dole has been the party's leading critic of the budget deficit, and perhaps the biggest skeptic of supply-side economic doctrine. &quot;The deficit remains Public Enemy No. 1,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;It won't go away and it won't grow away. This is an early warning.&quot;    Mr. Dole argues that he is a practical, old-fashioned Republican who knows how to get things done. &quot;This helps him,&quot; says Arthur Miller, a political scientist at the University of Iowa, site of the first 1988 presidential caucuses. &quot;He comes across as someone who has been working on the inside. People here see him as the most level-headed.&quot;    By contrast, Vice President George Bush, who has built his campaign around the administration's economic successes, could be hit hard by the week's events. And Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, a leading supply-side advocate, is put on the defensive.    Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. is trying to turn the situation to his advantage, saying that the market turmoil &quot;only confirms a lack of confidence in our economic policies.&quot;    While the situation may help or harm individual Republicans in the primaries, most analysts suggest that it will be a negative factor for them in the election no matter who the nominee is. No Democrat emerges as a clear winner in this kind of situation, but it may shift the terms of the debate. Where &quot;character&quot; until now has been the buzzword for Democrats, the new requirement may become competence and management skills.    Fratricidal Democrats pull together when the economy comes apart. It is the one issue that always unites them. And Democratic chances for winning the White House will surge if this week's gyrations are followed by a deep recession or even by a long period of economic uncertainty. &quot;If people are still frightened a year from now, this will have a tremendous effect on the election,&quot; says Richard Neustadt, a Harvard University political scientist, &quot;because if people are frightened, they tend to vote against the 'ins.'&quot;    But there is always a caveat with the Democrats: They are perfectly capable of bungling political opportunities. Perhaps a problem, too, is the party's relatively weak and inexperienced group of candidates, who may find it difficult to capitalize on any opportunity. Moreover, the party's most exciting candidate, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, has no credentials for dealing with complex economic problems.    But other candidates will stress their resumes in an effort to prove that they have the qualifications to deal with economic uncertainty. Rep. Gephardt can -- and does -- argue that he has the necessary skills to mobilize congressional support for a program to shore up the economy. As a member of both the Ways and Means and Budget committees, he has played a strong role in Congress dealing with economic issues. When Illinois Sen. Paul Simon served in the House, he was an early member of the budget committee. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis can point to his record managing a booming economy in his state; yesterday, he said the &quot;slide in the market is a warning sign, but it doesn't have to be the beginning of a collapse.&quot;    The sudden focus on economic issues may be disconcerting to Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who has been stressing foreign-policy issues in an effort to set himself apart from the rest of the pack and to appeal to voters in the South. Events in the Persian Gulf, which ordinarily would have played into his hands, have been eclipsed by the economic news, and he has rarely played a big role in the Congress in budgetary and fiscal issues.    Some people believe that if the economy really falls apart, the party might reach out to a New Deal/Great Society candidate. Sen. Simon is the closest thing to that in the current crop, but the American Enterprise Institute's Mr. Schneider, for one, predicts in that situation that the pressure for New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to run would become &quot;inexorable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
