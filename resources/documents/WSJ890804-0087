FDA records show that at least 35 manufacturers have flouted a law that requires them to report promptly any malfunction that results in death or serious injury, according to Public Citizen Health Research Group. The group said another 33 companies failed to meet the reporting deadline.    Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Washington-based advocacy group, said &quot;gross underreporting&quot; of malfunctions and design defects undermines the FDA's early-warning system for detecting patterns of potential problems and initiating recalls of malfunctioning devices. As a result, dangerous devices remain in use, he said, adding: &quot;It may be costing a large number of lives.&quot;    At the same time, Dr. Wolfe faulted the FDA for waiting eight years to begin enforcing the 1976 law and for failing to prosecute any companies for reporting violations. The agency is engaged in an &quot;educational caper,&quot; he asserted. &quot;They're educating the device industry that it is perfectly all right to break the law.&quot;    William Grigg, a spokesman for the FDA, took issue with the group's findings. &quot;This is a fairly new reporting system,&quot; he said. &quot;We are getting 15,000 reports a year . . . We think we're getting reasonable cooperation from the industry. The system has allowed us to do several quick recalls.&quot;    Public Citizen based its study on FDA documents it obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. These included reports on routine inspections of manufacturers between December 1985 and June 1988 and so-called notices of adverse findings that the agency sent them for failing to report deaths, injuries and malfunctions. Dr. Wolfe belittled these notices as a &quot;slap on the wrist.&quot;    During the period reviewed by the group, FDA inspectors found in company files records of seven deaths, 109 serious injuries and 265 malfunctions and one design defect that should have been passed on to the FDA, according to Dr. Wolfe.    In one case involving apparent alarm failures on an infant respiration and heartrate monitor, four infants died and four others suffered serious injuries, the group's study found. In another case, 178 malfunctions -- including ones that resulted in two deaths and one serious injury -- were linked to use of an intra-aortic balloon catheter, an implant that helps the heart pump blood. In addition, the group said, at least 31 serious injuries resulted from leaking breast prostheses.    Public Citizen also uncovered unreported cases of malfunctioning or defective pacemakers, wheel chairs, oxygen masks, crutches and defibrillators, which are used to restart heart beats. Yesterday, the group asked Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) to investigate the appearent breakdown in the reporting system and the FDA's enforcement performance. Messrs. Dingell and Kennedy are chairmen of subcommittees that oversee the FDA.    Mr. Grigg, the FDA spokesman, said that the agency will take a &quot;second look&quot; at the companies that didn't file reports as required. &quot;We don't have any reason to believe any of these cases were hidden from the FDA,&quot; he added. </TEXT></DOC>
