Current photometricand design requirements for original equipment sealed beam and integralbeam headlamps and replaceable light sources would be retained, but theamended requirements could serve as an optional means of compliance. Underthe proposal, roadway illumination systems would conform with roadway illuminationrequirements, instead of the individual lamps or light sources being designedto conform with photometric requirements applicable to specific types.NHTSA is proposing two sets of roadway illumination requirements for thelower beam, but only one would be adopted. Both sets of proposed specificationsoriginate in a computer model of test points based upon illumination oftarget areas representative of those in the driving environment as, forexample, pedestrians on roadways, lane markings, and signs. One of thespecifications proposed includes only those test points that are compatiblewith existing photometric specifications. The other specification proposedis based upon a better illumination of target areas, and illumination ofa larger locational range of targets. With either, the manufacturer ofa vehicle would have complete freedom to determine the number and characterof frontal lighting devices needed to provide the requisite minimum lightto illuminate the target areas. However, to ensure that replaceable lightsources intended for replacement purposes would have the dimensions andperformance of the original light source, manufacturers of original equipmentlight sources, whether intended for replaceable bulb headlamps or roadwayillumination devices, would be required to file dimensional informationwith NHTSA in a public docket pursuant to a new regulation, proposed Part564, <T3>Replaceable Light Source Dimensional Information. </T3>The notice implementsNHTSA's tentative conclusion that Standard No. 108 is at present overlydesign restrictive. The intended benefit of the change is to afford manufacturersgreater opportunities for design freedom and innovation, and to relievethem of the burden of petitioning for changes in Standard No. 108 whennew frontal lighting systems are developed. A further change proposed isdeletion of the impact test for headlamps, and an updating of the SAE J575test procedure referenced by Standard No. 108 based upon comments to anearlier NPRM on headlamp simplification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comment closing date for the proposal is November 9, 1989.The effective date of the final rule would be 6 months to a year afterpublication of the final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should refer to the docket number and noticenumber, and be submitted to: Docket Section, Room 5109, Nassif Building,400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

An NPRM, published on December 27, 1987, presentedNHTSA's recommendations for short term simplification, most significantlyin the area of aimability performance, with removal of some dimensional,durability, and photometric requirements that appeared no longer necessaryfor motor vehicle safety. A final rule based upon that proposal is beingpublished concurrently with this NPRM appearing elsewhere in this issue.The NPRM published today presents the agency's recommendation for longterm simplification of Federal headlighting requirements. This takes theform of a vehicle-based roadway illumination performance standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for a More Performance-Oriented Standard</ITAG>The history to date of the headlighting requirements of Standard No. 108may be divided into two chapters. The first covers the years 1968-1983.During this period, the only headlamps permitted were of sealed beam construction.The dimensions and photometric specifications for these headlamps werethose specified by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), and incorporatedby reference in Standard No. 108. Beginning in 1983, Standard No. 108 wasamended to allow another kind of headlamp, one that was no longer indivisible,and in which the light source could be replaced. Dimensions were no longerspecified for the lamp itself, but only the light source to ensure standardization.During this period, several additional types of sealed beam headlamps havebeen adopted as well. However, at no time in the history of Standard No.108 have manufacturers been free to adopt any type of headlamp or lightsource without first petitioning NHTSA to conduct a rulemaking proceedingto amend Standard No. 108 to make it responsive to their requests.A third chapter of Standard No. 108, one in which only roadway illuminationperformance is specified, begins with the issuance of this notice. NHTSAis proposing an optional set of requirements under which manufacturersmay use any type of headlighting system or light source they develop withoutthe need of petitioning for changes. Illumination would be provided by``roadway illumination devices'' or ``RIDs'', and a roadway illuminationsystem of such devices is termed a ``RIS'' in this notice. If the proposedamendments are adopted, future headlighting systems could be developedin conformance with the roadway illumination performance specifications,and it would no longer be necessary to petition for the adoption of furtherdesign-specific sealed beam headlighting systems or replaceable light sources.The roadway illumination specifications eventually adopted would offervehicle manufacturers an option to the photometrics of SAE J579c and Figures15 and 17 of Standard No. 108.<ITAG tagnum="84">Approach</ITAG>NHTSA has approached the issue of performance-oriented roadway illuminationfrom two directions. It seeks comments on each; however, only one approachwould be chosen for the final rule. Additionally, NHTSA seeks commentson whether the approach selected should be mandatory for all motor vehiclesat some time in the future. The specifications that are fundamental tothe development of each approach were produced by computer models of driver-visibilityneeds. Situations that commonly occur in the motoring environment and whereillumination is necessary to maintain the current level of safety wereselected. They were chosen and prioritized from analysis of accident dataincluding fatalities and injuries occurring during night driving. Thesesituations included the necessity to stay within lane boundaries, to avoidpedestrians on the side of the roadway, to illuminate signs, and to avoidobjects in the roadway. The development of these models and explanationof their use are contained in a Technical Paper which has been enteredinto the docket. From these models, test points and related illuminationlevels were developed.The plan for the development of this performance-oriented standard wasannounced in a Request for Comments that was published on August 14, 1987(52 FR 30393). The details of this plan were further expanded at a publicmeeting on this subject on September 2, 1987, which was announced in thesame notice. The plan, as outlined in the notice and at the meeting, is based on thevisibility needs of night driving. As noted above, the basic needs areto stay on the roadway, to avoid pedestrians and other objects, and tosee signs. A review of these needs, including a detailed analysis of accidentfiles, led the agency to evaluate the lighting requirements associatedwith these driving needs for a variety of conditions and situations. Theseconditions include the presence of either an approaching or a followingglare-producing vehicle, and driving on curved and hilly roads as wellas straight-level roads. The evaluation consisted of using a computer model of visibility to determinethe necessary amount of light that the vehicle must produce to enable thedriver to see important features, such as pedestrians and lane markers.The necessary amount of light for each of a large number of driving situationswas determined. In those driving situations where there was a glare-producingvehicle, the maximum amount of light that should be produced by the glare-producingvehicle was also determined. The criteria used in these determinationsinclude: the amount of light needed to see a pedestrian for a distanceequal to the stopping distance for a specified speed, the amount of lightneeded to see a sign at a distance which corresponds to 5 seconds of travelor the necessary stopping distance for a stop sign, and the light necessaryto see a lane marker at a distance which corresponds to 2 seconds of travel.The result of this evaluation was a set of roadway illumination specificationswhich consisted of over a thousand individual values. A compliance procedurethat includes such a large number of test points would clearly be impracticable.For this reason, the agency condensed the large number of values to a morerealistic number of values which could be used for determining compliance.Two methods for performing the condensation were developed and appliedto the data. The first method consisted of establishing a priority ranking of drivingsituations. This ranking was determined from the analysis of accident data.The relative priority of the driving situations was then used to eliminatelighting specifications for the lower-priority driving situations. Thebasis for this elimination was the concept that if two driving situationsresult in lighting specifications which are closely spaced, the higherpriority situation will preempt the lower priority situation. The numberof points was then further reduced by judiciously combining points thatwere close together. The final set of specifications from this approachis shown in Figure X-1. This set of specifications covers a broader areain front of the vehicle and contains higher intensity light near the centerof the roadway than the current requirements in Standard No. 108. It alsocontains minimum intensity specifications for the light that illuminatessigns. There is not a similar specification in the current requirements.The agency believes that if this set of photometric values is adopted therewill be an improvement in the lighting needed for nighttime driving whichmay in turn lead to a reduction in nighttime accidents. The second method for condensing the number of values consisted of comparingeach value with a set of values which corresponds to the average lightoutput from a large number of lamps, mounted between 22 inches and 32 inchesfrom the ground with a four foot separation, that meet the current requirementsof Standard No. 108. The application of this method resulted in eliminationof any point where the value exceeded the average value for the correspondingpoint. As with the first method, the number of points was reduced furtherby judiciously combining points which are close to each other. The resultingset of specifications is shown as Figure X-2. This set of specificationsis compatible with the average output of current lamps. However, it alsoincludes minimum values for the light that illuminates signs. The specifications which result from either of these methods are expressedas either a minimum or a maximum amount of illumination at specified pointsin front of the vehicle. An underlying condition that was part of the modelingis that only intensities which correspond to acceptable levels of glareare included. This fundamental constraint will have the effect of limitingthe heights at which some lower beam lighting units can be mounted. Lampscould still be mounted above 32 inches but they could not exceed lightlevels in the glare zone. As for the upper beam, intended to be used only in the absence of othervehicles, conversion to a vehicle-based performance is not necessary toassure adequate roadway illumination. The proposed specifications, identicalunder each alternative for lower beam, are those being implemented in theFinal Rule being published concurrently with this NPRM, for S7.4 IntegralBeam Headlighting System and S7.5 Replaceable Bulb Headlamp System. NHTSAbelieves that these photometric requirements will provide enough freedomof design that a vehicle-based illumination requirement is not necessary.NHTSA is, however, providing an additional vehicle oriented means for upperbeam performance: each side of the vehicle shall provide an upper beamthat meets the requirements of Figure 17. The application of the upper beam requirements of S7.4 and S7.5 would beaccompanied by the removal of horizontal and vertical location restrictionsthat now apply. The use of lower beam with upper beam permitted when usingthe photometry of Figure 15, however, would not be permitted in a RIS.The concern is that excessive foreground illumination could occur if thelower and upper beams were to be activated simultaneously. As presentlyspecified, upper beam photometry of Figure 15 has been specifically modifiedto permit simultaneous beam use without excessive foreground illumination.Excessive foreground illumination may occur should the lower and upperbeam of a RIS be simultaneously activated. This could occur as a resultof the upper beam RID's being placed substantially below the lower beamRID's, causing the light from the upper beam to strike the ground closerto the vehicle than would normally occur, since the upper beam RID's locationwould be unregulated. The resultant increase in foreground light couldfar exceed the levels of today's headlighting systems. NHTSA is concernedthat this would be detrimental to the driver's ability to see targets downthe road. Therefore a prohibition is proposed that would disallow simultaneousbeam use. The Notice proposes that the new systems ``conform'' to the roadway illuminationrequirements rather than being ``designed to conform'' as individual headlampsare today. Design language was introduced in Standard No. 108 when it becameeffective in the late 1960s because headlamp manufacturers felt that itwas economically infeasible to manufacture every headlamp to conform withthe photometrics specified for every test point. Normal variability inmanufacturing processes, even with quality control considerations, wouldcause a number of test point failures. This in turn, they feared, wouldlead to noncompliance determinations by NHTSA and the consequent notificationand remedy required by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.Although NHTSA emphasized that it would exercise discretion in noncompliancedeterminations, it adopted the ``design to conform'' language, not onlyfor photometrics but also for all aspects of lamp design. Originally itapplied only to the two sealed beam headlighting systems then existing,but amendments permitting new headlighting systems have also included ``designto conform'' language. The presence of ``design to conform'' language constitutesa lack of objectivity which could inhibit enforcement of the standard.The Act requires the safety standards to establish minimum performancelevels irrespective of design, and in proposing that roadway illuminationsystems ``conform'' to the new photometric specifications NHTSA seeks toimplement the intent of the statute. Because the new standard is performance-oriented,this appears to be an appropriate time and place to require conformance. Because of the performance orientation of NHTSA's proposed roadway illuminationrequirements, as long as the requisite light is provided at each specificpoint, it would no longer be material to specify the number, type, size,or location of lamps providing that light. However, to ensure adequatelighting should any RID in the RIS fail, the remainder of the system wouldbe required to produce not less than 40% of the light required. The vehicle-basedspecifications, however, do have one aspect that would affect design. Oneeffect is that since the illumination performance is based on drivers'safety needs instead of considerations of headlamp design, the illuminationperformance requirement is sensitive to glare light which originates fromheadlamps that are located higher than the driver eye height chosen forthe model. This eye height is 3.5 feet, and is the American Associationof State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) design guidelinefor highway sight-distance for hills and curves. As a practical matter,this means that headlamp mounting height may in effect be limited to amaximum of 3.5 feet, which would affect heavy trucks of conventional (ascontrasted with aerodynamic) design.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Test Procedures  </ITAG>Although Standard No. 108 establishes original equipment headlighting requirements,it is the headlamps that are tested for conformance, individually and notas part of a vehicle headlighting system. A fundamental difference betweenthe existing standard and the NPRM is the proposal of a systems approach.The term ``headlamp'' would no longer be used. The proposal refers to a``Roadway Illumination System'' or ``RIS.'' The RIS would consist of twoor more ``roadway illumination devices'' (RIDs), which would not necessarilybe headlamps as known today. Each RID need not produce a specific upperor lower beam, provided that a combination of RIDs would supply in totalthe prescribed roadway illumination at each specified point. Provisionis made for a required minimum level of system illumination to accommodatethe possibility of individual RID failure. If RID locations and numberare similar to those used on passenger cars today, the required performanceof a RID system (RIS) would also be similar. But if RID height above groundand distance from vehicle centerline differ markedly, or an asymmetricalarrangement were adopted, the designer would face a greater challenge indesigning the RIS to provide the requisite roadway illumination performance. The test procedure for lower beam would work in the following fashion.The individual RID Test Points would be determined according to certainmathematical expressions that would be provided. By using the locationof each RID relative to the Vehicle Reference Point (that point on theroad surface below the intersection of the vehicle's longitudinal axisand the vertical plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axisand tangent to the forwardmost RID lens face), and the Roadway Test Points,the vector from each RID to each Roadway Illumination Test Point couldbe determined. The vector components would constitute the RID Test Point.The level of illumination for an individual RID would be determined bythe lamp designer. However, the combination of illumination from each RIDon the vehicle at a Roadway Illumination Test Point would be governed bythe illumination value for that Roadway Illumination Test Point.  Readers will note that the impact test has been deleted from the seriesof proposed requirements and test procedures. This will apply to all replaceablebulb headlamps with plastic lenses, not only those developed and used underthe proposed roadway illumination performance requirement. In its NPRMon short-term headlighting simplification published on December 29, 1987(52 FR 49038), the agency asked for comments on the test but did not proposeits deletion; however, the comments received suggested deletion on thebasis that plastics used for headlamp lenses were sufficiently impact-resistant. Finally, with respect to test procedures, NHTSA is proposing that, unlessotherwise specified (such as for the vibration test), the version of SAEJ575 applicable to headlamp testing and Type F simultaneous aim photometrytests be changed from that of June 1980 to that of July 1983. This providesa more comprehensive and up to date test procedure.  The proposed options are intended to increase the flexibility of manufacturersin selecting methods of compliance and to encourage innovation withoutcompromising safety. NHTSA believes that the proposed requirements foreach option would achieve these goals. However, the agency seeks commentson whether the requirements would in fact do so, and on the likelihoodthat manufacturers would take advantage of both options.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Aftermarket Considerations</ITAG>The change to a specification based upon performance means that the designof replaceable light sources would no longer be specified in Standard No.108. To ensure that replaceable light sources manufactured for replacementare interchangeable with those used as original equipment, and that photometricperformance equivalent to the original is provided, NHTSA is proposingnew Part 564, <T3>Replaceable Bulb Dimensional Information.</T3> This would require manufacturersof replaceable bulbs used as original equipment in the headlighting orroadway illumination systems to submit to the agency dimensional informationas specified in the regulation, such as filament position dimensions andtolerances, dimensions pertaining to the filament capsule and its supports,and bulb base interchangeability dimensions and tolerances. The agencyhas established information dockets relative to tire rim combinations (StandardNo. 109), and vehicle identification number (49 CFR Part 565), and hasfound that they have worked well to date. This information would be submittednot later than 30 days after a light source entered production. Updatingwould be required upon changes to the light source. The regulation wouldcover only filament-type replaceable light sources, as the agency has insufficientinformation about the characteristics of other types to include them. In the past, the process of adding headlight designs, one by one, to thestandard, necessitated NHTSA's analyzing, and querying manufacturers about,rulemaking petitions concerning design-specific headlighting devices. Thatprocess often resulted in the indentification and correction of potentialhardware problems and led to design improvements. Under the proposal, headlightdesigns would no longer have to be added to the standard in that manner,and thus there would be no occasion for the agency to discover design problemsin the course of analyzing petitions and querying manufacturers. NHTSAinvites comments on whether SAE, the International Standards Organization(ISO), or some other group or mechanism can assure that any potential problemsin new designs are identified and corrected. Also, NHTSA invites commentson whether, if the proposal were adopted, the agency could or should continueto be involved in the specifics of headlamp designs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Impacts and Request for Comments</ITAG>NHTSA has preliminarily considered the economic impacts of this rulemakingproposal and has made a tentative determination that it is not major withinthe meaning of Executive Order 12291 ``Federal Regulation,'' but is significantunder Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures.The proposed roadway illumination requirements would afford an alternativeto motor vehicle manufacturers, who could choose to meet them, or to continueto meet the present requirements. In addition, within the optional roadwayillumination requirements, two alternative illumination specificationsare presented. A Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation of these alternativeshas been prepared and is available in the docket for this rulemaking atthe address listed above under <T2>ADDRESSES.</T2> As indicated in the Evaluation, it appears that thesafety benefits of the proposed alternatives would exceed the safety benefitsassociated with existing design requirements, and that it would be possibleto achieve the benefits of the proposal within the current cost levelsof today's headlighting systems. Because of an absence of detailed informationon benefits and costs, further analysis of the expected benefits in relationto the costs of the alternatives is needed for use in arriving at finaldecisions in the rulemaking. Accordingly, in order to determine the extentof any impacts, the agency requests the following information for use inpreparing the final regulatory evaluation:1. The ability of headlighting systems meeting current requirements tocomply with either of the proposed optional requirements.2. The production feasibility and costs of headlighting systems that wouldcomply with each of the proposed optional requirements.3. Indentification of the portion of the commenter's vehicle productionwhich, tentatively, might be certified to the vehicle-based requirement.4. The difference in compliance costs between certifying to the currentlamp-based requirements, and the proposed vehicle-based requirements.5. Suggestions for alternative compliance methods that would achieve thegoal of eliminating the ``design to conform'' language without imposingexcessive cost burdens.6. Further information regarding the effects on safety that are associatedwith the optional performance requirements.7. Other consumer benefits or disbenefits associated with the increaseddesign flexibility of the optional vehicle-based requirements, e.g. changesin aerodynamic drag, driver comfort and convenience, repair or replacementcost, etc.8. With respect to the destandardization of replaceable bulbs for headlamps,comments on the effect of the development of new replaceable bulbs, theircost, and the availability or replacements.9. Whether a greater or lesser number of dimensions should be proposedunder Part 564 than are included in this proposal.NHTSA has analyzed this proposal for the purposes of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. It is not anticipated that a rule based on the proposal wouldhave a significant effect upon the environment. The design and compositionof headlamps and roadway illumination devices might change from those presentlyin production, but it is not anticipated that the types and quantitiesof materials used in their construction would change.The agency has also considered the impacts of this proposal in relationto the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this proposal would nothave a significant impact upon a substantial number of small entities.Accordingly, no initial regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.Manufacturers of motor vehicles and headlamps, those affected by the proposal,are generally not small businesses within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictionswould be significantly affected only if the price of new vehicles and headlampsis more than minimally impacted.This proposal has also been analyzed in accordance with the principlesand criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and NHTSA has determinedthat this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications towarrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The replaceable bulb dimensional identification requirements in this proposal(proposed Part 564) are considered to be information collection requirements,as that term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in5 CFR Part 1320. Accordingly, these proposed requirements are being submittedto the OMB for its approval, pursuant to the requirements of the PaperworkReduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Comments on the proposed information collection requirementsshould be submitted to: Office of Management and Budget, Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer forNHTSA. It is requested that comments sent to the OMB also be sent to theNHTSA rulemaking docket for this proposed action. Interested persons areinvited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not requiredthat 10 copies be submitted.All comments must be limited not to exceed 15 pages in length (49 CFR 553.21).Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regardto the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commentersto detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion.If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality,three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidentialinformation, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the streetaddress given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidentialinformation has been deleted should be submitted to the docket section.A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter settingforth the information specified in the agency's confidential business informationregulation (49 CFR Part 512).All comments received before the close of business on the closing dateindicated above, will be considered, and will be available for examinationin the docket at the above address both before and after that date. Tothe extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also beconsidered. However, the rulemaking action may proceed at any time afterthat date, and comments received after the closing date and too late forconsideration in regard to the action will be treated as suggestions forfuture rulemaking. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant material asit becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommendedthat interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments inthe rules docket should enclose, in the envelope with their comments, aself-addressed stamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docketsupervisor will return the postcard by mail.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571</ITAG>Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles.The engineer and lawyer primarily responsible for this proposal are RichardVan Iderstine and Taylor Vinson respectively.In consideration of the foregoing, it is proposed that 49 CFR 571.108 MotorVehicle Safety Standard No. 108, <T3>Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment</T3> be amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 571_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

Paragraphs S8 and S8.1 would be revised to read:S8 <T3>Tests and Procedures for Integral Beam and Replaceable Bulb Headlamps,and RIS</T3>When tested in accordance with the following procedures, each integralbeam headlamp shall meet the requirements of paragraph S7.4, each replaceablebulb headlamp shall meet the requirements of paragraph S7.5, and each RIDof a RIS shall meet the requirements of S7.7.S8.1 <T3>Photometry.</T3> Each headlamp to which paragraph S8 applies, or RID,shall meet the appropriate requirements when tested in accordance withthe following procedures.S8.1.1 <T3>Headlamps.</T3> Each headlamp shall be tested according to paragraph3.5, Photometric Design Requirements of SAE Standard J579 DEC84 for meetingthe applicable photometric performance, after each of the tests specifiedin paragraphs S8.2, S8.3, S8.5, S8.6.1, S8.6.2, and S8.7.S8.1.2 <T3>RID Lower Beam.</T3> Each RID of a RIS (and any RID intended for itsreplacement) shall comply with this requirement when tested according tothe procedures of paragraph 3.5, Photometric Design Requirements of SAEStandard J579 DEC84 and paragraph 4.6 Photometry, of SAE Standard J575JUL83 after it has been tested according to each test specified in paragraphsS8.2, S8.3, S8.5, S8.6.1, S8.6.2, and S8.7. A \1/4\ degree reaim of anyRID is permitted to allow for errors between test laboratories. The RIScomplies if, at each test point of Figure X-1 (Figure X-2), the sum ofthe illumination provided by the RIDs in their design mounting positionon a vehicle meets the vehicle illumination performance specified in FigureX-1 (Figure X-2). In calculating this performance, the verification ofcompliance shall include consideration of the nominal design location ofeach RID including manufacturing tolerances, and all variances in heightof the RIDs attributable to any and all options authorized by the manufacturerfor installation on the vehicle, and to any and all conditions of vehicleloading.S8.1.2.1 The photometric performance of the lower beam of a RIS is determinedby taking the vehicle-referenced performance of Figure X-1 (Figure X-2),and converting it to a RID-referenced performance. The following mathematicalexpressions shall be used in the conversion for each test point:<ITAG tagnum="26">RIDHA=arc tan ([DIST*SIN(HORIZ ANGLE)-SEP]/[DIST*COS(HORIZ ANGLE)])</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">RIDVA=arc tan ([DIST*tan(VERT ANGLE)-HT]/DIST))</ITAG>RIDHA is the horizontal angle of the RID's beam that illuminates the RoadwayTest Point.RIDVA is the vertical angle of the RID's beam that illuminates the RoadwayTest Point.DIST is the straight line distance in feet from the Vehicle Reference Pointto the Roadway Test Point.VEHICLE REFERENCE POINT is the point on the road surface below the intersectionof the vehicle's longitudinal axis and the vertical plane which is perpendicularto the longitudinal axis and tangent to the forwardmost RID lens face.ROADWAY TEST POINT is any point specified in Figure X-1 (X-2) in frontof the vehicle where a target exists that needs a specified level of illumination.HORIZ ANGLE is the angle in degrees between the vehicle's longitudinalaxis at the Vehicle Reference Point and the line from the Vehicle ReferencePoint to the Roadway Test Point measured in the horizontal plane. As usedin Figure X-1 (X-2), ``Positive'' is to the right, as viewed by the driver.VERT ANGLE is the angle in degrees measured in a vertical plane betweena horizontal plane through the Vehicle Reference Point and the line fromthe Vehicle Reference Point to the Roadway Test Point. As used in FigureX-1 (X-2), ``Positive'' is upward, as viewed by the driver.SEP is the horizontal distance in feet from the vehicle's longitudinalaxis to the photometric axis of the RID. As used in Figure X-1 (X-2), rightis ``Positive'' as viewed by the driver.HT is the vertical distance in feet from the road surface to the photometricaxis of the RID.Test point intensities in candela are determined by multiplying the requiredtarget illumination in foot-candles by the square of the target distancein feet:<ITAG tagnum="26">TARGET ILLUM. x. (TARGET DIST) \2\ =SCREEN CANDELA</ITAG>S8.1.3 <T3>Roadway Illumination Devices, Upper Beam. </T3>The RIDs comprisingthe upper beam shall be tested for upper beam compliance using the proceduresof paragraph 3.5, Photometric Design Requirements of SAE Standard J579DEC84, paragraph 4.6, Photometry of SAE Standard J575 JUL83, after thetests specified in paragraphs S8.2, S8.3, S8.5, S8.6.1, S8.6.2, and S8.7.The RIDs shall be tested for conformance with the photometry appropriatefor the configuration of Integral Beam System or Replaceable Bulb Systemthat comprises the RIS. If the photometry is that of Figure 17, the RIDsfor each side of the vehicle shall be placed in a test fixture that replicatestheir design locations on the vehicle. The test fixture shall be placedon the goniometer such that the centroid of the RID(s) optical axis (axes)is aligned with the photometer axis. The assembly of RIDs shall be correctlyaimed in accordance with the photometric test procedures referenced inthis section. If the RIDs are aimable with a Vehicle Headlamp Aiming Deviceas specified in S7.8.5.2, the goniometer alignment procedures of that sectionshall be used. The RID assembly so configured shall conform to Figure 17.A RIS shall comply with any combination of original or replacement RIDs.A \1/4\ degree reaim of any RID assembly is permitted to allow for errorsbetween test laboratories.9. In the last sentence of paragraph S6.1, and in paragraph S10(a), withreference to SAE J575 the words ``JUN80'' would be changed to ``JUL83''.10.
