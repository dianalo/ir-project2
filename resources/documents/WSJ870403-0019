The Indianapolis-based company said it wants to focus its resources on its core pharmaceuticals business. Most analysts hailed Lilly's move to sell a sluggish corporate performer and concentrate on its fast-growing biomedical research. Lilly introduced its second genetically engineered product, a form of human growth hormone, earlier this week.    Lilly is just the latest in a series of drug companies that have moved to shed their cosmetics businesses and concentrate on pharmaceuticals. Last December, Squibb Corp. sold its fragrances and cosmetics business to Yves Saint Laurent S.A., the Paris fashion house, for about $630 million.    &quot;The drug industry tried cosmetics and realized it was a whole different marketing game,&quot; said Lynne Pauls, an analyst with E.F. Hutton in New York. &quot;Cosmetics businesses don't offer the margins that pharmaceutical businesses do.&quot;    Lilly said proceeds from any sale of Arden would be used in part to buy back stock. It said it plans to buy back as many as 2.3 million shares to offset the dilution that would result from the conversion of notes Lilly issued during its acquisition last year of Hybritech Inc., a San Diego-based biotechnology company. At the end of February, Lilly had 139.6 million shares outstanding.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Lilly closed at $95.75 a share, up $2.25.    Arden's profits have been hurt by sluggish growth in the U.S. market for upscale cosmetics, some analysts said. Despite a strong market presence, the unit's operating profit over the past five years grew at only half the rate of the total company, said Ronald Nordmann, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York. Although Arden's sales rose 13% in 1986, almost all of that growth took place overseas; the unit's operating profit actually fell 22% because of increased competition in the industry and flooding at Arden's sole U.S. cosmetics manufacturing plant.    Nevertheless, Arden could be considered a hot property by some cosmetic and personal-care companies, analysts said. Arden has well-known fragrance and cosmetic brands and a strong position in skin care, the fastest-growing segment of the market.    &quot;Avon (Products Inc.) would give their eyeteeth for Elizabeth Arden,&quot; said Lynne Hyman, Hutton's cosmetics analyst in New York. New York-based Avon, which bid unsuccessfully for Squibb's cosmetics business, is currently looking for a company to broaden its distribution channel.    In New York, an Avon spokesman said the company &quot;would be interested in looking&quot; at Elizabeth Arden. He added: &quot;We have said we are interested in entering retail channels and reaching customer segments we don't presently reach.&quot;    Shiseido Co. Ltd., of Tokyo, the world's largest cosmetics company, might also be interested in acquiring Arden to expand its market niche in the U.S., Hutton's Ms. Hyman said. </TEXT></DOC>
