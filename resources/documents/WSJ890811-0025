While the Bush administration refused to rule out direct talks with Iran, Pakistan's foreign minister is expected to meet with officials in Tehran to discuss the release of hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems in Lebanon. A Tehran newspaper reported that &quot;indirect talks&quot; would begin soon. The Pakistani minister, who is planning a trip to Tehran next week, met with U.S. officials last week in Washington, and an administration aide said the captives were &quot;prominently discussed.&quot;    Two U.N. peacekeepers were injured as militiamen allied with Israel rounded up Moslems in southern Lebanon, a day after an Israeli convoy was attacked.    ---   MOSCOW SAID it would start paying farmers partially in foreign currency.    In an effort to reduce the nation's agricultural imports and increase domestic production, the Soviet Union announced that farmers growing wheat and other commodities would be paid in foreign currency, presumably U.S. dollars, for anything they produce above average levels from 1981-85. The official Tass news agency said the government decision appeared to apply, at least initially, to state and collective farms.    The plan, first proposed during a recent session of Moscow's new legislature, is the latest in a series of moves to shake up the agricultural sector.    ---   Rescue crews in Ethiopia were sent to a remote area after two U.S. satellites detected separate emergency distress signals that could have come from the missing aircraft of Democratic Rep. Leland and 13 others. The signals, both far from the flight path of the plane that disappeared Monday, boosted hopes of finding the aircraft.    ---   Solidarity lawmakers met with members of two small political parties to discuss Walesa's proposal to form a government coalition in Poland without the Communist Party. If the two parties, traditionally aligned with the Communists, join with the union-led opposition, they would hold the balance of power in the Parliament.    ---   Estonia banned strikes in an attempt to end a protest by thousands of the Soviet republic's ethnic Russian minority. But the strikers vowed to continue the walkouts, which have affected more than 30 factories. The strikes erupted Wednesday after the approval of a law tightening residency requirements to vote or run for public office.    ---   Bush selected Powell to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The four-star Army general, national security adviser to Reagan, would be the first black to hold the post as the nation's senior military officer. Bush who passed over several more senior officers with his decision, called Powell, 52, a &quot;complete soldier.&quot;    ---   The Air Force confirmed that the five astronauts aboard the space shuttle Columbia had placed a spy satellite into orbit. The satellite reportedly is designed to snap detailed photographs of military targets, mainly in the Soviet Union. The spacecraft is scheduled to land Sunday in California.    ---   Agricultural officials have detected hot spots of aflatoxin, a carcinogen that plagued the U.S. corn crop last year, in Texas and the Midwest. The outbreak of the fungus-produced poison in south Texas is of particular concern since much of the region's recently harvested corn crop is used by many food companies.    ---   Officials in Mexico said more than 100 people were killed and about 200 injured in Wednesday's derailment of a passenger train in northwestern Sinaloa state. Rescue workers searched for survivors of the crash, which scattered cars across the track into surrounding fields and a ravine. The train was headed to Mexicali from Mazatlan.    ---   U.S. immigration officials have approved requests from three of nine Nicaraguan Contra members seeking political asylum, the State Department said. The rebels had sought asylum Wednesday, two days after five Central American leaders agreed on a plan to disband the guerrilla forces.    ---   Police in South Africa dispersed a rally by about 500 trade union members outside a Johannesburg courthouse, where 27 of their co-workers were charged with disturbing the peace. Police used whips and batons to break up the protest. At least 18 black demonstrators were injured and 20 people were arrested, union authorities said.    ---   Authorities in Lebanon said at least 22 people were killed and about 140 injured in artillery duels between Syrian gunners and Christian forces in and around Beirut. More than 500 people have been killed since the latest round of fighting erupted in March.    ---   A study concluded that 10% of U.S. hospitals surveyed, mainly in inner cities, treated 58% of 14,145 patients with AIDS in 1987. The National Public Health and Hospital Institute also said that hospitals had a loss on average of $136 a day for each AIDS patient admitted. </TEXT></DOC>
