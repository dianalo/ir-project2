Gatorboxes have to download their configurations from a machineover the network.andP;  Sometimes that works better in theory than practice.&quot;andM;The gateway also ships with monitoring and control software.andP;  &quot;It collectsnetwork statistics that the manager's software lets you tap into.andP;  I use thatto really see what's going on,&quot; said Paul Veverka, network technician forTucson, Ariz.-based Alphagraphics Inc., a chain of commercial print shops.andM;Ballowe said he'd like to see better security features.andP;  &quot;I'd like to be ableto keep a single device, like a printer, from showing up on other zoneswithout having to isolate an entire port,&quot; he said.andM;Compatible Systems Corp. is at P.O.
