<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-1076 </DOCNO><TEXT>Motor Vehicle exhaust emissions have been the subject of legislation inEurope since 1970. America and Japan introduced legislation earlier andmade it progressively more sever such that catalysts had to be fittedto cars. These catalysts require unleaded petrol to achieve satisfactoryperformance. In the early 1980s, political pressure was applied in theEuropean community (EC) to both lead in petrol and exhaust emissionsof unburnt hydrocarbons (HC), Carbon Monoxide (CO) and oxides of nitrogen(NO/sub x/). This resulted in the EC'S commission making studies to assessthe possibilities and implications of eliminating lead from petrol andfurther reducing exhaust tail-pipe emissions. After many months of discussionsand negotiations the member states were able to agree on two directives.The 'Lead' directive introduced unleaded petrol at a quality of 95 researchoctane number (RON), 85 motor octane number (MON) on a mandatory basisfrom October 1989. The 'emissions' directive specified a further reductionof HC, CO and NO/sub x/ levels for different categories of vehicles andin different timescales, beginning in 1988. The costs associated withthe measures contained in the directives will be high for the oil andmotor industries and, ultimately, the motorist.</TEXT></DOC>
