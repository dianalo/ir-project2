Former Marine Corps Commander Paul X. Kelley testified atNorth's trial that in spring 1984 ``there were a number of people''who intervened in the North matter, including CIA Director WilliamCasey and United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick. They urgedthat North be permitted to remain at the NSC.   Also today, the Supreme Court refused to scuttle North'sIran-Contra trial or block the trials of two of his co-defendants.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments aimed atdismissing the case because of testimony the defendants gave to acongressional committee.   Contacts with Casey and Kirkpatrick followed a plea from RobertMcFarlane, then National Security Council adviser, that North wasengaged in ``extremely important work'' and should stay on, saidKelley.   The former Marine commandant said he was concerned that a delayin returning to the corps would hurt North's military career, buthe acquisced to the request.   While Kelley was on the witness stand, prosecutor John Kekerpresented a series of messages between North and McFarlane showingthat North did not want to return to the Marine Corps base at CampLejeune to command a battalion.   A major private contributor to the Contra cause, Mrs. EllenGarwood, testified that North never asked her for money and that atno time did she make out a check in his presence. She said that a$75,000 check she wrote to a fund-raising organization was draftedafter she left a briefing by North in his office.   ``He said, `this is a desperate situation for the freedomfighters. I'm not asking you for money. As a member of thegovernment and the National Security Council I cannot ask formoney','' said Mrs. Garwood, an Austin, Texas, heiress who has saidpreviously that her contributions to the Contra cause totaled $2.2million.   On Sept. 12, 1985, Mrs. Garwood said, she wrote out a check for$32,000 after a briefing from North at a Dallas airport.   ``While Colonel North was present, did (fund raiser Carl)Channell ask you for money that night?'' asked defense counselBrendan Sullivan.   ``No, he never did that,'' she said. ``Colonel North wouldn'thave allowed it.''   Kelley became the first witness for the defense, following asix-week presentation by the prosecution, which formally concludedits case today.   Kelley said that in February 1985 McFarlane asked in a breakfastmeeting McFarlane had requested that North's NSC tour be extendedagain.   ``I was not favorably disposed'' to grant the extension, butagain did so, said Kelley.   By February 1985, North was deeply involved in a secret effortto ship arms to the Contras. Congress had banned military aid tothe Nicaraguan rebels as of October 1984.   A third request to extend North's tour came in the spring of1986 and was granted through the ``normal channels,'' said Kelley.   North had sought to call President Reagan as his first witness,but the judge in the case said Friday there was not any evidence tobolster a claim that Reagan had authorized North to commit illegalactivities.   North lawyer Barry Simon jumped Friday on the prosecution's weakpoints, citing uncertainty by McFarlane about whether North wrote akey draft of a letter to Congress.   The September 1985 letter to then-U.S. Rep. Michael Barnesdenied North was assisting the Contras and resulted in a chargeagainst him of making false statements to Congress.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell reserved the right to setaside a verdict on another charge on grounds the alleged crimemight not have been committed in Washington, D.C., but rather inadjacent Virginia.   The charge accuses North of accepting a security system free ofcharge from co-defendant Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted torun arms to the Contras.   Proving the charge is complicated by the testimony of former CIAemployee Glenn Robinette, who testified he sent backdated bills toNorth demanding payment for the security system without beingasked. Robinette said he engaged in a cover-up after getting aphone call from North pointing out that he hadn't sent him a bill.   Robinette had been paid months before by Secord and North didn'tcontact Robinette about the matter until a week or so after beingfired from his National Security Council staff job in theIran-Contra affair. The attorney general had announced when Northwas fired that a criminal investigation would be conducted.   At Friday's hearing, the judge mused whether Robinette was on``a frolic of his own or CIA bias or what'' when he launched acover-up without being specifically asked to do so.   Gesell dashed North's hopes that he could call Reagan as awitness in an attempt to bolster the defense's central contention,that if North told lies, he was authorized to do so.</TEXT></DOC>
