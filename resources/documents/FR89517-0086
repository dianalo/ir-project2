The new system was mandated by Congress to improve the Institute'sability to motivate and retain staff and to attract and hire highly qualifiedcandidates. NIST will also simplify personnel administration and give managersmore authority and accountability for personnel management.The major features and interventions of the project are total compensationcomparison with the private sector, simplified position classificationwith delegation of authority and accountability to line managers, agency-basedhiring, direct-hiring, recruiting and retention allowances, pay for performance,and supervisory pay differentials.NIST will annually compare compensation for NIST positions with compensationfor similar positions in the private sector and, to the extent allowedby budget limitations, will make up the net increase in the deficiencythrough an annual comparability pay increase for all employees rated ``fullysuccessful'' or higher. In position classification, career paths and broadpay bands have replaced the General Schedule (GS) grade structure. NISTconducts its own hiring, rather than hiring through the Office of PersonnelManagement (OPM) registers, and fills most scientific and engineering vacanciesthrough the direct-hire process. NIST management will grant recruitingand retention allowances up to $10,000 in special cases. Supervisors willdetermine pay increases within pay bands on the basis of performances appraisals.Supervisors and managers who would not otherwise be compensated for supervisionor management will be given pay differentials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Project Plan Modifications </ITAG>The official NIST Project Plan appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 2, 1987 (52 FR 37082). In order toimplement the plan fully, it is necessary to modify certain sections sothat they express more clearly the intentions of OPM and NIST in designingthe project. In the ``Staffing'' section of the original plan, errors were made in describingappointment reports to OMB (none required), open-continuous applications(should be critical shortage occupations only), the career paths coveredby the category of critical shortage highly-qualified candidates (shouldnot include Support Career Path), and the approval authorities for thetiming of Recruitment and Retention Allowances (the approval authoritycited for Recruiting Allowances should have been cited instead for RetentionAllowances, and the authority cited for Retention Allowances should havebeen cited for Recruiting Allowances). The definition of ``promotion'' (52 FR 37091) has not proved practicablein its coverage of movements from one career path to another, because itdiffered too much from the traditional definition in the Federal PersonnelManual (FPM). The revised definition parallels the definition in the FPM.Also, the time-in-pay-band requirement one year for promotion eligibilitywas not made explicit. This Notice, therefore, changes the definition of``promotion'' and adds the time-in-pay-band requirement to the same section.The original project plan provides that new hires are eligible for reimbursementof travel expenses to first post of duty and relocation expenses ``in thesame manner as is authorized in sections 5723 and 5724 of title 5, U.S.Code'' (52 FR 37091). It was intended that the authority cover all thefacets of relocation expenses described in sections 5724a, 5724b, and 5724cof title 5, as well as those mentioned in the original plan. This noticeamends the project plan to add specific reference to the three recipientsto repay travel expenses when they separate prior to the end of their serviceagreements. The project plan does not mention the process by which a supervisory paydifferential is discontinued when the supervisory responsibilities arediscontinued. This modification adds this process and makes clear thatloss of a supervisory differential is not an adverse action and is thereforenot subject to appeal. Finally, all instances of ``National Bureau of Standards,'' ``NBS,'' and``Bureau'' are changed to ``National Institute of Standards and Technology,''``NIST,'' and ``Institute,'' respectively, in accordance with a provisioinof the Technology Competitiveness Act signed into law by the Presidenton August 23, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director. </ITAG>The demonstration project plan for the Alternative Personnel ManagementSystem at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on Friday, October 2, 1987 (52 FR 37082-37096)is amended as follows: 1. <T3>Staffing_Reports to OPM:</T3> OPM's Office of Examining Services hasdecided it does not want a report on each direct-hire appointment. Thefollowing sentence (52 FR 37090) is deleted: <ITAG tagnum="21">A completed copy of the Federal Automated Examining System (FAES),Key Entry Examination System (KEES), or other appropriate appointment packagewill be provided to OPM's Office of Examining Services for all individualsappointed. </ITAG>2. <T3>Staffing_Open-Continuous Applications:</T3> The statement on open-continuousapplications appeared under the subsection titled ``Direct Examinationand Hiring: Critical Shortage Occupations,'' and was intended to applyonly to that category; therefore ``critical shortage occupations'' is addedto the following sentence (52 FR 37090) as indicated by brackets: <ITAG tagnum="21">Although no registers will be maintained, NBS will accept applicationson an open-continuous basis for all direct hire [critical shortage occupations]</ITAG>3. <T3>Staffing_Critical Shortage Highly-Qualified Candidates:</T3> The SupportCareer Path was not intended to be covered by this category; therefore,the sentence that reads ``Critical shortage highly-qualified candidatesmay be directly hired for entry level positions in the Scientific and Engineering,Scientific and Engineering Technician, and Support Career Paths'' (52 FR37090) is changed to read: <ITAG tagnum="21">Critical shortage highly-qualified candidates may be directly hiredfor entry level positions in the Scientific and Engineering and Scientificand Engineering Technician Career Paths </ITAG>4. <T3>Staffing_Recruitment and Retention Allowances:</T3> The authoritiesfor approving recruiting and retention allowances were unintentionallyreversed in one passage (52 FR 37091). The passage is changed to read:<ITAG tagnum="21">A Recruitment Allowance may be paid in a lump sum at or soon afterentry on duty or may be paid in increments over a period of time determinedby the [MOU Director], not to exceed 36 months. A Retention Allowance maynot be paid in a lump sum but must be paid in increments over a periodof time determined by the [PMB], not to exceed 36 months.</ITAG>5. <T3>Travel Expenses:</T3> The ``Travel Expenses'' subsection (52 FR 37091)is replaced with the following new subsection (new material is bracketed)to make clear which sections of title 5, U.S. Code, are covered and toemphasize the repayment obligation upon separation prior to the end ofthe agreement:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Travel Expenses </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the discretion of the NIST Director, travel and transportationexpenses, advancement of funds, [per diem expenses incident to travel,and/or relocation expenses] may be provided to new hires in the same manneras is authorized in sections 5723, 5724, (5724a, 5724b, and 5724c) of title5, U.S. Code. The selecting official, with approval of the MOU Directoror the MOU Director's designee, will make application decisions. Recipientsmust sign service agreements indicating commitment of at least 12 monthscontinued service. Service agreements will contain [a repayment obligation]in the event the recipient separates from Federal service before the endof the agreement. Actions to collect repayment may be terminated underappropriate circumstances and in accordance with generally applicable standardsfor termination.</ITAG>6. <T3>Staffing_Promotion:</T3> The sentence that reads ``A promotion is amove from one level (pay band) to a higher level within a career path,or a move from a level in one career path to a level with a higher payrange in another career path'' (52 FR 37091) is changed to read:<ITAG tagnum="21">A promotion is a change of an employee to (1) a higher pay band inthe same career path, or (2) a pay band in another career path in combinationwith an increase in the employee's salary. The time-in-pay-band requirementfor promotion eligibility is one year.</ITAG>7. <T3>Supervisory and Managerial Pay Differentials:</T3> The intent of Congresson the discontinuance of a supervisory differential was not adequatelyreflected in the notice; therefore, the following new subsection is addedto the section on ``Pay Administration'' (52 FR 37092) immediately underthe subsection titled ``Supervisory and Managerial Pay Differentials'':<ITAG tagnum="84">Supervisory and Managerial Pay Differentials </ITAG>The House Post Office and Civil Service Committee Report accompanying theproject legislation stated that supervisory and managerial pay differentials``will be terminated when an employee leaves a supervisory or managementposition. Such termination will not be cnsidered a reduction in pay.''Where an employee's pay band does not change as a result of undertakingsupervisory responsibilities, the granting of a differential will not beconsidered a promotion or a competitive action. The differential will bediscontinued when an employee's supervisory responsibilities are discontinued.The cancellation of a differential will not itself constitute a demotionor a reduction in pay. The cancellation of a supervisory differential,therefore, will not constitute an adverse action and there will be no rightof appeal under 5 USC Chapter 75. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-11778 Filed 5-16-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6325-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
