(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two youngsters pulled a prank on theirmom Saturday but it backfired and no one laughed _ especially notauthorities who believed an 8-year-old had been kidnapped.   The older of the boys, age 12, told their mother his youngerbrother was ``picked up by somebody in a red car who took off,''said Constable Stephen Williamson of the Roxbury Town PoliceDepartment.   The 12-year-old and his mother approached Williamson's patrolcar and ``both of them were crying,'' the officer said. ``Themother was hysterical. All the kid told me was that `a car pulledup and took my little brother.'''   Williamson alerted the Delaware County Sheriff's Department andthe state police in Oneonta and Margaretville on his radio, thenheaded toward Margaretville _ ``because he (the boy) said they wentthat way.''   The sheriff's department, in turn, notified the local radiostation in this small town about 80 miles southwest of Albany.   ``They wanted us to tell listeners to be on the lookout for ared car headed to the Roxbury or Margaretville area from GrandGorge,'' said Kevin Wright, the disc jockey at station WDLA.   The station interrupted programming and broadcast the warning onits AM and FM frequencies at least seven times, said Wright.   Meanwhile, authorities set up roadblocks and Williamson returnedto question the children's mother. It was then he learned it wasall a joke devised by the children, intended only to scare theirmother.   The 8-year-old child had been ``in the woods near the home thewhole time and he'd come back (home),'' Williamson said.   His 12-year-old brother was crying. ``The kid realized what hedid,'' the constable said.   Williamson refused to release the names of the children or theirmother.   ``In a way it was sad, but I was glad it wound up being likethat 'cause nobody really was hurt,'' Williamson said. Then hespeculated about what would happen to the 12-year-old boy, saying,``I think maybe his mother will warm his bottom.''</TEXT></DOC>
