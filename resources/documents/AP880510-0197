But Murphy also said the United States was ``completelysatisfied'' with assurances given by China and the Saudis that themissiles would not be equipped with nuclear or chemical warheads.   He told a congressional hearing the assurances were made bothorally and in a letter from Saudi King Fahd to President Reagan.   Despite those assurances, the United States still would like toinspect the missile sites and was continuing to discuss thatpossibility with the Saudis, Murphy said. But another U.S.official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said he wasdoubtful the Saudis would change their minds.   Defense analysts argue that the conventional missiles could beconverted easily for use as nuclear or chemical arms. But Murphytold the hearing that by agreeing last month to sign theInternational Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Saudi Arabia wasprecluding the missiles' conversion to nuclear weapons.   Murphy conceded, in response to questioning, that U.S.intelligence agencies had failed to detect the 1986 deal for thesale of the CSS-2 intermediate-range missiles which have a range ofup to 1,800 miles.   ``We had no firm fix on it until January (1988) and nothingdefinite until March,'' he told a joint hearing of the HouseForeign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East and thesubcommittee on arms control, international security and science.   The Chinese missiles being deployed in the Saudi desert are notaccurate weapons and ``in our view, they also do not improve thesecurity of Saudi Arabia. But the Saudis feel differently,particularly in view of the threat from Iran,'' Murphy said.   Saudi Arabia and Iran have been at odds for several years andthe tensions culminated last month in the Saudi decision to cut offdiplomatic ties with Tehran.   Murphy was testifying on behalf of the administration's proposalto sell the Saudis a $325 million package of maintenance andtraining for U.S.-made AWACS radar surveillance planes. The fiveplanes were supplied to the Saudis last year under a 1981 contract.   Murphy also was lobbying for the sale of 200 Bradley fightingvehicles, equipped with anti-tank TOW missiles, worth $500 million.   Murphy said Saudi Arabia had warned the United States that ifCongress rejects the sale, the Saudis ``will go elsewhere.'' Henoted that when Congress turned down the sale of F-15 fighter jetsto Saudi Arabia in 1985, the Saudis signed a $12 billion contractwith Britain for Tornado fighters.   ``We lost business and influence,'' Murphy said.   He said Saudi Arabia uses the U.S.-supplied AWACS for aerialpatrols to protect American naval forces against Iranian attacks inthe Persian Gulf. The Saudis also allow the United States access totheir ports and air bases, and provide F-15 fighter jet protectionfor U.S. AWACS flights over the northern part of the gulf, he said.   The two sales before Congress ``are clearly in the interest ofthe United States,'' he said.   More than 180 members of the House and 58 Senators have askedSecretary of State George P. Shultz to block the Saudi salespending clarifications of the Chinese missile purchase.</TEXT></DOC>
