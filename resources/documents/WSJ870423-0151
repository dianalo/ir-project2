Icahn, chairman, said.    TWA's estimated operating loss of about $25 million will make it the &quot;best first quarter TWA has had in the last 15 years on an operating basis,&quot; Mr. Icahn said in an interview, in which he was optimistic about the airline's prospects. For the 1986 first quarter, TWA had an operating loss of $150 million, on revenue of $656.4 million.    Traffic gains and cost-cutting shrank the latest quarter's loss, Mr. Icahn said. &quot;Since I took over TWA in 1985, TWA has cut off about $400 million in costs, but we are still basically flying the same number of planes,&quot; he said. He also said the &quot;benefits of the Ozark (Air Lines) acquisition (in 1986) are now coming on stream.&quot;    For all 1987, &quot;barring unforeseen circumstances,&quot; Mr. Icahn said, &quot;we will far exceed the best year that we ever had, which was in 1965,&quot; when the company had net income of $83 million.    Mr. Icahn declined to estimate first-quarter or full-year revenue. TWA had a 1986 net loss of $106.3 million, on revenue of $3.15 billion.    TWA expects heavy summer traffic on its North Atlantic flights, Mr. Icahn said. Bookings rose strongly in the first 19 days of April, he said, to about 10,000 a day, compared with 3,000 a day last April, when a flight attendants' strike and fears of terrorism discouraged travel.    TWA's load factor, or the percentage of available seats occupied, will rise to about 66% on its international fights this month from about 45% in April 1986, Mr. Icahn said.    He said TWA is negotiating long-term leases on 10 new McDonnell-Douglas 80 aircraft.    By the end of April, he said, TWA will have on hand cash and equivalents of about $550 million after paying off $250 million in five-year extendable notes. No new financing is expected in 1987, he said. He also noted that TWA has &quot;more than $50 million in unrealized profit&quot; on its 4% stake in USX Corp.    He said that this year, &quot;TWA will probably hire back more than 500&quot; of the 5,000 flight attendants who were fired during the strike last year. Already more than 200 attendants have returned to work as a result of a federal court order.    He reiterated that, contrary to rumors, &quot;TWA is not for sale, nor are we currently looking to acquire any other airline.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
