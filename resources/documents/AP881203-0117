All of the demonstrations were peaceful and no injuries werereported, police said.   ``The goal from the beginning was to lock the doors and savebabies from abortion,'' said Brian Rechten, spokesman for the NewJersey demonstrators, who he said kept as many as 10 women fromentering the clinic.   ``We're just trying to give them the other side,'' Rechten said.``We're not talking about a blob of protoplasm. We're talking abouta human life.''   The protests are the latest in a series around the country mostlyorganized by a group called Operation Rescue and dating to thissummer's Democratic National Convention. Hundreds of people havebeen arrested, many staying in jail for extended periods, refusingto identify themselves.   New York police arrested about 250 anti-abortion demonstrators ina failed attempt to shut down a Manhattan Planned Parenthood clinicthat provides abortions, counseling and other health services forwomen.   The protesters prayed and sang, drawing jeers from a handful ofpro-choice advocates. As the anti-abortion demonstrators sang ``GodBless America,'' their counterparts chanted: ``Sexists, fascists,anti-gay! Born-again bigots, go away!''   Mimi Grinker, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, said the clinicsaw about 25 women during the day, about half the number of patientsthat visit on a normal Saturday.   Those arrested were issued appearance tickets and then freed ontheir own recognizance, said Sgt. Norris Hollomon, a policespokesman.   In Cincinnati, 77 people were charged with trespassing at aPlanned Parenthood clinic, and three of them faced additionalcharges of resisting arrest because they had to be carried to policevans, authorities said.   Sara Meyer, a spokeswoman for the demonstrators, claimed success,saying: ``With the streets blocked off, the `girls' can't get inthere. They've got another day to think about it.'' Ann Mitchell ofPlanned Parenthood said the clinic had rearranged its appointmentschedule in anticipation of the sit-in.   Police arrested 56 people on trespassing charges after about 100demonstrators blocked entrances to the Akron Center for ReproductiveHealth, said Susan Palidar of Cleveland, spokeswoman for the protestorganizers.   Merrillville, Ind., police arrested 34 anti-abortion protesterson criminal trespass charges after protesters blocked doors to aPlanned Parenthood clinic. All but two of them were from out oftown, police said.   More than 50 peaceful demonstrators forced the closure of theWomen's Medical Center, an abortion clinic in Howell Township, N.J.,but they dispersed about 11 a.m. and there were no arrests, policesaid.   ``Once the clinic closed, that was the end of it,'' said Lt.Peter Wulfekotte.</TEXT></DOC>
