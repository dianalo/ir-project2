Discussion of Comments</ITAG>We received comments from two health care organizations in response tothe notice of intent: The American Medical Association (AMA), and the GeorgiaHealth Network (GHN). Both organizations expressed the view that deferringthe update of prevailing charge levels is inadvisable.The AMA commented that the deferral should not be carried out because (1)physicians' costs continue to rise, (2) other factors besides physicianpayment levels are to blame for program cost increases, and (3) comparingCHAMPUS payment levels with the lower amounts paid by Medicare is inappropriatebecause Medicare has arbitrarily restricted growth in payment levels. Regardingthe first point, we agree that increases in physician costs should be recognizedin payment levels. However, the current update methodology does not considerphysicians' costs; it reacts only to physicians' billed charges. Assumingthat Congress adopts the update methodology that actually considers physicians'costs, namely the Medicare Economic Index (MEI), we will implement it.The action to defer the October 1, 1988 update, therefore, is a stopgapmeasure, taken to restrain growth until the MEI is in place for CHAMPUS.The MEI is designed to factor in increases in physician office costs andgeneral wage levels.The AMA is correct that factors other than higher payment levels have contributedto program cost growth. Some of those factors, such as growth in the numberof beneficiaries and introduction of new, high-cost health care technologies,are beyond our control. We feel it is sound public policy to attempt tofairly constrain program growth by addressing the factors which we canaffect, such as the unconstrained growth in payment levels. This has clearlybeen one of the major factors that has contributed to spiraling CHAMPUScosts.The final point raised by the AMA is that it is inadvisable to use Medicareas a benchmark for CHAMPUS because the Medicare reimbursement methodologyis being reviewed and appears to be flawed, and because Medicare paymentlevels for physicians have been severely constrained in recent years. Weagree that Medicare payment levels should not be the barometer for determiningthe appropriate level for CHAMPUS reimbursement; the two programs servedifferent beneficiary populations under different circumstances, and havedivergent methodologies for determining reimbursement levels for professionalservices. We do not propose, nor would either this deferral of updatingprevailing charge levels or adoption of the MEI method result in CHAMPUSpayment levels being the same as those for Medicare. Comparisons with Medicareare provided only to indicate the present generosity of CHAMPUS paymentlevels, as compared with the major Federal payor for health services, andto emphasize that modest constraint on increases in CHAMPUS prevailingcharges is a reasonable step to undertake.The Georgia Health Network had two main comments: first, that the proposeddeferral will have negative effects far outweighing the value of the costsavings, and second, that other avenues to controlling costs are more appropriate.GHN raises the concern that beneficiary access to care will suffer becausephysicians will be hesitant to treat CHAMPUS patients if payment levelsare reduced. The group points out that payment levels are currently veiwedfavorably, while the administrative burden associated with the programis viewed negatively by physicians. We agree that beneficiary access tocare is an important issue in relation to establishment of payment levels;it has been our contention all along that payment levels are sufficientlyhigh that a modest constraint can be achieved without threatening access,and we continue to believe that. In view of the generous allowable chargelevels that will continue to exist, even with a one-year deferral, we donot think it likely that many physicians will deny affordable care to militaryfamilies. We are concerned about providers viewing the program negatively,and have worked very hard to assure timely and accurate payments and highquality provider service by our fiscal intermediaries.GHN comments that there are two policy objectives to be pursued: Maximizingbeneficiary access to high quality care, and securing that care at thelowest cost to the government. GHN comments that constraints on the levelof reimbursement should be matched with systemic constraints upon beneficiaryutilization of the program. We agree in concept, and are developing andtesting ways to constrain unnecessary utilization of services, includingthe development of working relationships with the Peer Review Organizationswhich review medical care for Medicare. This will help for inpatient care,but for other kinds of care, it is considerably more difficult to constrainunnecessary utilization. In the meantime, we feel it is appropriate topursue constraints on payment levels as a first step.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Action to be Taken</ITAG>The Director of the Office of CHAMPUS will defer the update of CHAMPUSprevailing charge levels for professional services effective October 1,1988. This will have the effect of maintaining the prevailing charge levelsin effect for Fiscal Year 1988, which ends on September 30, 1988. Thisdeferral will be in effect until January 1, 1989, if the MEI is then inplace as a restraint on growth in CHAMPUS prevailing charges, in whichcase prevailing charge levels will be updated based on the MEI methodology,or, if Congress does not adopt the MEI method until October 1, 1989.As an aside, a January 1 MEI-based update would allow CHAMPUS to be placedon the same calendar year update cycle as is currently followed by Medicare.This would assure that in future years we will have accurate MEI-relateddata before our updates.As stated in our notice of intent of August 17, 1988, there are severalreasons for implementing a deferral of the update of CHAMPUS prevailingcharges for professional services. First, CHAMPUS costs have been risingat an alarming rate, resulting in Congressional calls for Department ofDefense action to restrain costs. From fiscal year 1984 to 1987 CHAMPUScosts grew by over 70 percent, from $1.2 billion to over $2.1 billion.The prefessional services component has been growing faster than CHAMPUSas a whole, increasing by nearly 90 percent from 1984 to 1987. This yearprofessional services will account for about $1 billion. DoD has takena series of steps to gain some control over components of the CHAMPUS budget,most notably including the establishment of a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)-basedpayment system and other payment method reforms affecting certain categoriesof institutional charges. To date, however, CHAMPUS has not yet implementedneeded cost saving measures relating to professional fees.Second, because CHAMPUS continues to pay for most professional fees onthe basis of the physician's or other provider's billed charges, CHAMPUSallowable amounts are higher than necessary to assure fair payment to providersand broad access to care for beneficiaries. Part of the reason for thisis that CHAMPUS has not yet adopted some of the cost containment measuresthat have become popular with public and private payors. For example, beginningin 1974 under and Act of Congress, the Medicare program began restrainingthe rate of growth in professional fees by limiting increases to amountsjustified by documented changes in physician office practice costs andgeneral wage levels, these things being measured by the Medicare EconomicIndex (MEI). As an indication of the generosity of current CHAMPUS allowablecharges relative to other payers, the CHAMPUS costs per professional visitgrew by about 31 percent from 1984 to 1987, while the MEI grew by only11 percent. Thus, it is most likely that the FY 1988 CHAMPUS physicianpayment levels (to be carried over in FY 1989) generally exceed those Medicarewill be paying in FY 1989.The third reason for implementing a deferral of prevailing charge updatesis that this can be accomplished without hardship to CHAMPUS beneficiaries.Under current procedures, the vast majority of all physicians' chargesare paid exactly as billed. Because of this, there is almost no amountdisallowed and almost no balance billing of the beneficiary. In total,about 93 percent of the total amount charged by physicians is allowed byCHAMPUS. Less than four percent of all dollars shown in billed chargesare subject to balance billing. Because CHAMPUS payment rates are now sohigh, there is room for modest constraint without risk of a significantdrop in assignment rates or an increase in balance billing. For these three primary reasons, the Director of CHAMPUS, with the approvalof the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, will defer anyallowable charge update until October 1, 1989, unless the MEI is in placefor CHAMPUS, or January 1, 1989, in which case allowable charge levelswill be updated by the MEI method. Subject to final Congressional actionon the pending Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1989, it appearsthat the MEI will be put in place by January 1, 1989, in which case thedeferral of the update of prevailing charges will cease at that time.<ITAG tagnum="6">Linda Bynum,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Alternate OSD Federal Register Liaison Officer, Department of Defense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="34">September 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-22378 Filed 9-28-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3810-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
