The agreement announced Wednesday by the Labor Department'Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires the companyto implement the plan within three years. It will affect plants in20 states and is the second such agreement between OSHA and a majormeatpacker in a year.   Sara Lee also agreed to pay $20,000 in fines and drop its appealof four OSHA citations issued in November after an inspection of thecompany's Hillshire Farm plant in New London, Wis.   Those citations were for willful violations of laws limitingexposure to cumulative trauma disorders.   ``Sara Lee deserves praise for its willingness to recognize theergonomic hazards ... in the meat industry and to take positivestops to control those illnesses throughout its many meat processingplants,'' said acting OSHA head Alan C. McMillan.   Attempts to reach Sara Lee for comment were not successful. Acompany spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone message.   The meatpacking industry is considered to be among the nation'smost dangerous, with common ailments suffered by workers includingloss of digits and carpal tunnel syndrome, a degenerative nerve andmuscle disorder that can render hands and fingers inflexible andoften is attributed to repetitive motion.   The agreement requires Sara Lee to employ consultants to reviewthe processes used in its meat plants that expose workers torepetitive motion and other hazards linked to cumulative traumadisorders.   If new equipment and other engineering controls cannot be used toreduce the potential hazards, Sara Lee will be required to rotateworkers and take other steps to prevent physical fatigue of certainmuscles, OSHA said. In some cases tests of workers exposed torepetitive motion will be required to determine whether their dutiescause muscle deterioration.   Sara Lee also agreed to develop training programs for itsworkers, supervisors and plant medical personnel. Proper knife careand usage would be among the topics of training for workers, OSHAsaid.   The agreement is similar to one reached in November between OSHAand IBP Inc., in which the meatpacker agreed to implement similarpreventive measures at 15 plants.</TEXT></DOC>
