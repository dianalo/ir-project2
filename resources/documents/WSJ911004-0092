Appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr.Gates spoke in a voice quavering with emotion as he sought todefend his integrity against adverse testimony by formercolleagues that has threatened his candidacy to lead the CIA.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I never distorted intelligence to support policy or toplease a policy maker,&quot; said Mr. Gates, using words such as&quot;pernicious&quot; and &quot;reckless&quot; to describe the allegationsagainst him. &quot;It is a period when we got a lot right. We gotsome important things wrong, but people were basicallycalling them as they saw them.&quot;   Republicans applauded the force of Mr. Gates'spresentation, but the former CIA deputy still faces doubtsamong the moderate and conservative Democrats who are mostimportant to him in the committee and full Senate.   Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), who had been silentpreviously, weighed in yesterday with questions challengingthe CIA's independence in evaluating Pakistan's nuclearweapons program in the 1980s. And Chairman David Boren's (D.,Okla.) cross-examination of the nominee reflected continuedconcern about Mr. Gates's role in the Iran-Contra affair andhis handling of a politically sensitive intelligenceassessment in 1985 on the Soviet role in the attemptedassassination of Pope John Paul II.   The attack on the Pope was a preoccupation for former CIADirector William Casey, and though Mr. Gates said he had nofixed opinion on Moscow's complicity, the 1985 paper wasstructured to make the case for the plausibility of Sovietinvolvement. Written in a matter of weeks, the analysis wasdistributed to cabinet secretaries and the White House, butwas sharply criticized months later by an internal CIA studythat found the work &quot;spotty&quot; and lacking balance.   The episode is embarrassing for Mr. Gates because he hadbeen the conduit for circulating the paper to high officials,and his letter to then-Vice President Bush described theanalysis as &quot;comprehensive&quot; and enabling the agency to&quot;present our findings with some confidence.&quot;   In retrospect, the nominee conceded yesterday that thecover letter should have better reflected the limitations ofthe work. But he acknowledged too that he had never alertedMr. Bush or other high policy makers about the later,internal CIA critique.   Mr. Glenn's questioning regarding Pakistan touched on Mr.Gates's active role within the agency on behalf of militaryaid to Afghan resistance groups fighting the Soviet-backedregime in Kabul. This covert program was carried out in closealliance with Pakistan through the 1980s, and the senatorindicated that the CIA inspector general's office wasinvestigating if intelligence had been skewed in the sameperiod so as not to disrupt relations over the nuclearweapons issue.   Mr. Gates said he remembered no instance in which the CIAhad been pressured to &quot;tone down&quot; intelligence related to thePakistan weapons program, but his answers suggest that theremay have been an effort to work around the legal wording ofrestrictions affecting assistance to the Islamabadgovernment. Aid to Pakistan is subject to an annualcertification by the president that the government doesn'thave a nuclear weapon. In this connection, Mr. Gatesdescribed a &quot;caution&quot; from the Reagan administration for theCIA &quot;to be very careful about the words that were useddescribing the situation.&quot;   More often, &quot;caution&quot; was hardly the watchword for Mr.Gates, who cut a swath through the agency as he rose underthe guidance of the late Director Casey. &quot;You did too good ajob for Bill Casey,&quot; said Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.),who has swung against the nominee since the hearings beganlast month, and Mr. Gates admitted that he must address theperception of politicization at the agency if confirmed asdirector.   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D.,Ga.), who is slated to question the nominee this morning,indicated last night that he remains troubled by thetestimony against Mr. Gates. More broadly, the hearings couldforce lawmakers to reassess their own responsibility to keepcloser tabs on intelligence analysis.   Senate and House oversight committees have historicallypaid more heed to budget issues and covert operations, yetthe hearings have suggested that ideological differences hada far-reaching impact on what policy makers were told of theSoviet threat to the U.S. and role in the Third World.   Mr. Gates faulted the CIA for being &quot;flabby&quot; in assessingMoscow's intentions in developing countries in the 1970s, andhis critics argue with equal ferocity that the Casey erabrought on a hard anti-Soviet line that led the U.S. toignore evidence of a Soviet retreat in the 1980s. Thousandsof papers and intelligence estimates were produced in Mr.Gates's tenure in the top management, and he seems to havebeen torn between his intellectual, analytical background andhis political ambitions to rise in the bureaucracy.   With obvious pride yesterday, he cited an October 1986memo arguing for more sensitivity to changes in Sovietsociety; days later, he delivered a still controversialspeech to advance the Reagan administration's StrategicDefense Initiative. Similarly, Mr. Gates was a sterntaskmaster in insisting on more factual evidence to support acritique of the Afghan resistance forces. Yet he frustratedhis own Soviet analysts at another juncture when they felt apaper actively promoted by Mr. Casey was without sufficientevidence to back up back up a central premise in favor ofselected arms sales to Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
