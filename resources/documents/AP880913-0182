The department's Energy Information Administration said therevisions in estimates of existing reserves were the largest ithasever recorded.   Proven reserves amount to oil in the ground that has beenmeasured, and is considered producable with ``reasonablecertainty'' with current prices and techniques. Many analysts likenthe category to the on-the-shelf inventory in a store.   Since the amount recoverable depends on price, withcostly-to-produce formations being passed over when prices are low,proven reserves will fluctuate even if additions to reserves justbalance production.   As of Dec. 31, the department said, U.S. proven reserves were27.256 billion barrels, up 1.4 percent or 367 million barrels from26.889 billion barrels recorded a year earlier.   Proven natural gas reserves fell 2.3 percent from 191.6 trillioncubic feet to 187.2 trillion cubic feet, continuing the trend ofthe past six years.   Alaska crude oil reserves increased 503 million barrels with netupward revisions in estimates totaling 535 million barrels beforediscoveries, other adjustments and production of 718 millionbarrels. Projects to recover oil normally left in the ground,``infill'' drilling to increase production from existing fields andbetter estimates of field performance all contributed to theincreases, the department said.   In the lower 48 states, reserves decreased 0.7 percent or 136million barrels with net upward revisions in estimates of 1.353billion barrels before discoveries, other adjustments andproduction of 2.155 billion barrels.   Large gross upward revisions in reserves also were recorded inCalifornia, 505 million barrels, and in West Texas, 477 millionbarrels, because of ``enhanced recovery'' efforts to produce oilfrom existing fields, the department said.   Overall Alaska reserves increased 7.3 percent from 6.875 billionbarrels to 7.378 billion barrels. Lower-48 reserves decreased 0.7percent from 20.014 billion barrels to 19.878 billion barrels.California reserves fell 0.5 percent from 4.734 billion barrels to4.709 billion barrels and Texas reserves fell 0.6 percent from7.152 billion barrels to 7.112 billion barrels.   For the country as a whole, discoveries added 691 millionbarrels to reserves in 1987, 29 percent above the 534 millionbarrels added in 1986 but 22 percent below the 1977-1986 average.   A higher average price for the year, $15.41 per barrel vs.$12.51 for 1986, enabled oil companies to count more oil in the``proven'' category, the department said.   Prices are now falling, said Ed Murphy of the American PetroleumInstitute, the principal trade group.   Though the Alaska gain was larger than he expected and thelower-48 decline smaller, he expected, ``the downward trend inreserves over the last four to six years is apparent,'' he said. Inonly two years since 1980, when reserves were 29.805 billionbarrels, have reserves increased, 1984 and 1987.   The upward revisions from enhanced recovery projects ``are theresult of substantial investments made in the late 1970s and theearly 1980s which are just showing up.''   Such investments are now declining, and the consequent lack ofproduction and upward revision in reserve estimates will take a fewyears to become apparent, Murphy said.</TEXT></DOC>
