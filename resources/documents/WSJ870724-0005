Up to 28% Rise in NetFor Fiscal 4th Quarter</HL><DD> 07/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DFDOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO) </IN><DATELINE> FRANKLIN PARK, Ill.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dean Foods Co. expects to post an increase of as much as 28% in net income for its fourth quarter ended May 31, on a sales increase of about 6%, Chairman Kenneth J. Douglas said.    The food and dairy concern expects to report profit in the range of $13.1 million to $13.6 million, or 49 to 51 cents a share, Mr. Douglas said. Year-earlier net was $10.6 million, or 40 cents a share. He said sales rose to about $373.7 million from $353.3 million.    Earnings estimates are being bolstered by the strong sales of the company's new liquid yogurt, he said. &quot;It's drinkable yogurt that comes in three flavors,&quot; he said. &quot;So far it's been introduced in Chicago, and soon we'll have it out nationally.&quot;    Mr. Douglas also said: &quot;Milk sales have been very good in recent months. Ice cream, probably because of the warm spring and summer, has been a strong seller.&quot;    One new Dean Foods product that isn't selling well is its Calcium Plus milk. &quot;We're a little disappointed in it,&quot; Mr. Douglas said.    For the fiscal year, he estimated that net was flat at about $41 million, or $1.53 to $1.54 a share, compared with $40.7 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier. He said sales rose about 12% to $1.4 billion from $1.27 billion.    Mr. Douglas said capital spending for the full year rose to $41.6 million from $36.5 million, largely because of the costs of developing tamper-resistant packaging for certain dairy items.    Dean Foods is studying acquisition prospects, Mr. Douglas said: &quot;We're busy looking. We want to stay in the food business.&quot; He added, &quot;We're not looking for turnarounds, only (for) profitable companies in the U.S.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dean Foods closed at $35.75 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
