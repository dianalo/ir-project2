Rather, it mixed reassurance on the warfront with appeals for altruism on the home front as Bush alternately talkedto Americans as commander-in-chief and as a &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; president.;   In response, congressional Democrats supported Bush's war goals but criticizedhis undefined domestic agenda, saying the federal government needs to do morefor Americans without health insurance, children with an inadequate educationand families struggling to survive the recession.;    Sen. George Mitchell,D-Maine, the majority leader, struck at what the Democrats consider the greatvulnerability of the president, that he is too consumed by the Persian Gulf topay attention to &quot;the crisis&quot; on the domestic front.;    Not surprisingly,Bush received some of his loudest applause when addressing the war, whichstarted Jan. 17 to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. His emotional tributeto U.S. forces serving in the Persian Gulf drew a long bipartisan standingovation.;     Bush said the war was &quot;on course,&quot; and that &quot;Iraq's capacity tosustain war is being destroyed.&quot; He vowed that Iraqi President SaddamHussein's apparent effort to prolong the conflict will not work.;    &quot;Timewill not be Saddam's salvation,&quot; Bush said.;    &quot;We will succeed in the gulf.And when we do, the world community will have sent an enduring warning to anydictator or despot, present or future, who contemplates outlaw aggression,&quot; hesaid.;    He depicted the war as part of the &quot;hard work of freedom&quot; familiarto Americans.;    &quot;We know why we're there,&quot; Bush said. &quot;We are Americans:part of something larger than ourselves.&quot;;    For Americans who worry that theUnited States is shouldering too much of the burden of expelling Iraq fromKuwait, Bush said that such a responsibility is &quot;the burden of leadership.&quot;;   'Our cause is just';  &quot;This we do know,&quot; he said. &quot;Our cause is just. Ourcause is moral. Our cause is right.&quot;;    As a guard against terrorism spawnedby the war, Bush's address was delivered under heightened security precautionsat the Capitol. Streets within four blocks of the building were closed off twohours before the speech. Dignitaries were advised to arrive early to allow forsecurity checks.;    One dignitary not invited was the top-ranking Iraqidiplomat in Washington, Khalid al-Shewayish, the charge d'affaires. A StateDepartment spokeswoman said he was excluded &quot;for obvious reasons.&quot;;    Asusual, one Cabinet member was not at the speech, to prevent the 17 officialsin the presidential line of succession from being in the same place. InteriorSecretary Manuel Lujan Jr. was the designated no-show this year.;    Emotionalhigh points;  Two emotional high points in the evening came when Bushintroduced Brenda Schwarzkopf, wife of H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commandinggeneral of the U.S. gulf forces, and Alma Powell, whose husband, Colin, ischairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They watched the address with BarbaraBush from the gallery above the House floor and were greeted with standingovations.;    In the speech, Bush decided to put more emphasis on domesticissues than some advisers thought he would. Polls show persistent publicdoubts about Bush on the domestic front.;    But he offered little more thangeneralities when outlining his agenda. More details will come when theadministration's budget is released Monday, but the constraints of theexpanding federal budget deficit, which the administration estimates at $318billion this year, are expected to make any new programs relatively small andinexpensive.;    'Something to give';  Bush called for increased volunteerism,something that doesn't cost the government money. For Bush, it was aresurfacing of the &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; theme that marked his presidentialcampaign and first months in office but has been absent during the gulfcrisis.;    &quot;We all have something to give,&quot; Bush said. &quot;So if you know how toread, find someone who can't. If you've got a hammer, find a nail. If you'renot hungry, not lonely, not in trouble -- seek out someone who is.&quot;;    Infact sheets accompanying the speech, the White House said the administrationwould soon release banking reform legislation, a program to deal with highinfant mortality rates in targeted cities and a comprehensive energy plan.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CHARLES GREEN, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910130  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  918  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 30, 199100030138,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
