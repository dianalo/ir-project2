Siegel, one of Wall Street's leading investment bankers, was spending the afternoon in the Park Avenue offices of Martin Lipton, an eminent takeover lawyer and a man Mr. Siegel had come to regard almost as a father.    Suddenly a federal marshal burst in upon the two men, thrusting a subpoena into Mr. Siegel's hand. When Mr. Siegel read the subject matter of the investigation -- Ivan F. Boesky -- and the accompanying list of his own takeover deals at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. in the 1980s, he knew his career was over. He began sobbing, as a horrified Mr. Lipton rushed to comfort him.    The public end to Mr. Siegel's career, once one of the most spectacular success stories on Wall Street, came last Friday. He resigned his year-old position as co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and pleaded guilty in federal court to two felony counts for his role in the Boesky scandal. Coming just a day after the stunning arrests of three top Wall Street professionals, Mr. Siegel's pleas still managed to shock Wall Street. More than anyone else so far implicated in the scandal, Mr. Siegel personified the American dream.    He also embodied the new breed of investment banker who has ridden the takeover boom of the '80s to the top. Inside information was inextricably linked to his own rise, and he is cooperating fully in the government's continuing investigation. His testimony has already implicated the three men arrested last week, and he has described the pressure for profits from high-level Kidder Peabody officials that allegedly led to the misuse of inside information by the firm's arbitrage department.    In sum, Mr. Siegel's testimony is a vivid chronicle of how systemic the abuse of inside information has become on Wall Street.    This is the story of Mr. Siegel's rise and abrupt fall. It has been pieced together from scores of interviews with people who know Mr. Siegel and with people who are familiar with at least portions of Mr. Siegel's recent statements to the government as well as those of others who have testified in the government's continuing investigation.    (Mr. Siegel couldn't be reached to comment on this account. The government wouldn't identify his whereabouts, citing his continuing cooperation and importance as a potential witness. His lawyer, Jed S. Rakoff, declined comment.)    In the eyes of many Wall Street observers, the takeover boom came of age on Aug. 26, 1982, when Bendix Corp. launched a $1.5 billion hostile bid for Martin Marietta Corp., the opening salvo in what became the now-legendary four-way battle involving Bendix, Martin Marietta, United Technologies Corp. and Allied Corp. And thrust into the center of the action, in his role as Martin Marietta's chief strategist, was a young, hitherto little-known merger specialist at Kidder Peabody named Martin Siegel.    By the time of the Bendix bid, Mr. Siegel had known Ivan F. Boesky for years. Kidder Peabody, where Mr. Siegel was the key mergers and acquisitions strategist, didn't have an arbitrage department so Mr. Siegel couldn't use his own firm for the information about stock positions and company valuations that is crucial to takeover strategy and is the arbitragers' stock-in-trade. He had come to rely on Mr. Boesky, whose persistent phone calls had led to a close relationship. Indeed, they spoke on the phone for five years before they met in person in 1980.    Mr. Siegel had become awed by the vast wealth he saw Mr. Boesky amassing. Two years before the Bendix bid, Mr. Siegel had been invited to dinner at Mr. Boesky's sprawling estate in suburban Westchester County; the Boesky house dwarfed the house that Mr. Siegel was planning to build on Long Island Sound. On two other occasions, Mr. Boesky had come out to the Siegel home to play tennis, a game Mr. Siegel loved and played well. Mr. Boesky arrived in his pink Rolls-Royce.    Mr. Siegel's awe at Mr. Boesky's possessions was all the more pronounced because he came from a modest family background that had been marked by financial struggle. When he was 20 years old, his father, then in his 40s, had filed for bankruptcy, an event that left an indelible impression on the son. Indeed, friends say that Mr. Siegel was haunted by the fear that someday, like his father, he would fail just as he reached the prime of life.    For the same reason, he saved money compulsively. For years, he had lived as a bachelor on his relatively modest $50,000 annual salary at Kidder Peabody, saving all of his much larger bonuses. But in 1981 he married his second wife, another investment banker at Kidder Peabody, and they had their first child the next year. They built a large home in Greens Farms, one of the most exclusive enclaves on the Connecticut coast. They had a New York apartment as well and hired a nurse for the child. Mr. Siegel's salary wasn't enough to cover these burgeoning expenses; he was depleting his carefully saved capital.    Several days before the Bendix bid, Mr. Siegel, then 33, trim, dark-haired and strikingly handsome, pushed through the double doors of the grill room at New York's Harvard Club. Mr. Siegel spotted Mr. Boesky and the two settled down for what would become a fateful conversation.    Mr. Siegel aired some of his personal financial concerns to Mr. Boesky. He must have known that to do so in front of an arbitrager was like placing red meat before a lion. &quot;I'll make some investments for you,&quot; Mr. Boesky volunteered, and one thing led to another. By the end of that conversation, the two had forged an agreement: In return for information furnished by Mr. Siegel, Mr. Boesky would pay him an unspecified percentage of Mr. Boesky's own profits from trading on the information.    At the beginning, Mr. Siegel didn't expect to be leaking inside information; he thought he would simply be using his expertise as an investment banker to identify companies he deemed likely takeover targets. Indeed, Mr. Boesky had agreed that to trade on inside information just before a deal was publicly announced, or during the course of a deal, was too risky. The goal was to get Mr. Boesky into a takeover stock so early that the purchases couldn't possibly attract the interest of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other market watchers.    Bendix/Martin Marietta, however, provided an opportunity too good to resist. Martin Marietta, Mr. Siegel's client, had responded to the Bendix bid with the most audacious of tactics: the &quot;PacMan&quot; defense, named after the video game, in which the target tries to devour its suitor with a counterbid. Martin Marietta offered to pay $1.5 billion for Bendix.    In some ways, the tactic showed Mr. Siegel at his best. Although it wasn't the first time it had been employed, &quot;it was wildly creative to do it on this scale,&quot; recalls one participant. Says another colleague, &quot;You see the creative impulse in the literary and artistic worlds, only rarely in law or business. Marty had it.&quot;    But the PacMan defense, to be effective, needed some market momentum to get Bendix into play, pushing up its stock price so it would realize the market was taking the Martin Marietta attack seriously. So just before Martin Marietta's bid was unveiled, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Boesky and leaked the top secret plan, fully aware that he had just crossed the line of illegality. It was the last time he ever used the telephone to convey inside information to Mr. Boesky; shortly after, his feelings of guilt manifested themselves in a paranoid belief that his phone was tapped.    Using Mr. Siegel's information, Mr. Boesky bought Bendix stock, eventually realizing a profit of about $120,000. The PacMan defense succeeded. Bendix lost its independence and was acquired by Allied, and Martin Marietta survived, though at a cost so high that the PacMan defense has never again been attempted on such a scale. The battle was a coup for Mr. Siegel, thrusting him into the limelight just as the nation's takeover boom erupted. And it put Kidder Peabody, considered an established but sleepy firm in decline, at the forefront of merger-defense work.    Mr. Siegel parlayed that fame into a thriving defense-oriented merger practice, modeled in part on the successful takeover law firms. Mr. Siegel tirelessly traveled around the country, persuading chief executives of major corporations to pay Kidder Peabody a retainer to defend them should they become the target of a hostile corporate raid. Over time, he succeeded in scores of instances. &quot;Marty was the most persuasive, most charming investment banker I'd ever met,&quot; recalls one chief executive who joined the Kidder Peabody fold. &quot;He had a terrific bedside manner with {chief executive officers} and boards.&quot;    But his success wasn't immediately reflected in a significantly higher salary. Over the years he complained about Kidder Peabody's stinginess, its refusal to recognize his contributions to the firm and its penchant for doling out money to unproductive senior partners. In December 1982, a few months after the Bendix/Martin Marietta battle began, he turned to Mr. Boesky and asked the arbitrager for a cash payment of $125,000.    Mr. Boesky readily agreed even though the sum exceeded his profits from Mr. Siegel's information about Bendix. To avoid detection, Mr. Boesky placed the cash in a suitcase and gave it to a courier who met Mr. Siegel in a public place. Mr. Siegel gave the courier an agreed-upon password, and he handed over the suitcase. Mr. Siegel kept the cash hoard, dipping into it throughout the year to pay employees, such as his child's nurse, and for spending money. He thought of the money as a &quot;consulting fee.&quot;    With the exchange of money, Mr. Siegel's relationship with Mr. Boesky settled into a pattern. When Mr. Boesky wanted information, or when Mr. Siegel had information he wanted to leak, the two got in touch by telephone. The signal was &quot;Let's have coffee,&quot; and they then met in person to exchange the information, first in an alley behind 55 Water St., the financial-district building where Mr. Boesky worked, and later, after Mr. Boesky moved into the former Fifth Avenue offices of fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich, at a nearby midtown coffee shop.    In early 1983, Mr. Siegel leaked inside information about a bid by Diamond Shamrock Corp. for Natomas Inc. and a bid for Pargas Inc., later acquired by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. In September he told Mr. Boesky that Gordon Getty, one of Mr. Siegel's clients, was dissatisfied with the management of Getty Oil Co. and that a sale of the company was likely; it was eventually acquired by Texaco Inc. In 1984, he told Mr. Boesky about a bid for Midlands Energy Co. and used inside information about Carnation Co. to predict it would be sold. Nestle S.A. eventually acquired Carnation, and Mr. Boesky earned a profit of more than $28.3 million on that deal alone.    The insider trading in these instances was extremely clever. In at least three cases, Natomas, Getty and Carnation, Mr. Siegel used inside information to make an educated prediction that a major corporate transaction would ensue. Mr. Boesky was thus able to take enormous stock positions ahead of any final decision to make a bid. Even if detected by the authorities, such trading didn't look like it could possibly be insider trading. And in every instance, it could be argued that Mr. Siegel's leaks actually worked to his clients' benefit by driving up the stock price at which they were eventually acquired, and to Kidder Peabody's benefit by boosting its fees that were based on the sale price.    At the end of both 1983 and 1984, Mr. Boesky and Mr. Siegel met to tally up Mr. Siegel's fee. Mr. Boesky began by saying, &quot;What did you do for me this year?&quot; and Mr. Siegel responded with an analysis of his leaks. The two end-of-year cash payments totaled $575,000.    Mr. Siegel, however, was becoming increasingly anxious about the scheme; and during the summer of 1984, he received a tremendous jolt from an article in Fortune magazine. Buried in the text of an otherwise-flattering profile of Mr. Boesky was one sentence: &quot;Boesky's competitors whisper darkly about his omniscient timing, and rumors abound that he looks for deals involving Kidder Peabody and First Boston.&quot;    Panicked, Mr. Siegel hastily sought a meeting with Mr. Boesky. But the arbitrager was unfazed, noting that the magazine had nothing specific and suggesting that he could set up a foreign bank account for Mr. Siegel if he was really worried. Mr. Siegel demurred, appalled by the image of himself as a fugitive. He vowed to stop passing inside information, even though he couldn't bring himself to tell Mr. Boesky, and he accepted the 1984 payment.    The Carnation deal, details of which Mr. Siegel leaked from April through June 1984, was the last about which Mr. Siegel passed information to Mr. Boesky. Indeed, the pattern of Mr. Siegel's leaks is almost as conspicuous for the deals in which he didn't leak inside information as for those in which he did. For example, one of Mr. Boesky's greatest windfalls came when he correctly anticipated that Lenox Inc. would give in to a hostile bid from Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. in 1983. Mr. Siegel represented Lenox, but he wasn't the source of any leak. Mr. Boesky apparently had inside information even before Mr. Siegel knew it.    Similarly, Mr. Siegel defended Richardson-Vicks Inc. in a hostile bid by Unilever in 1985, but he didn't pass information to Mr. Boesky. Rather, Mr. Boesky passed valuable information about the transaction to Mr. Siegel indicating the presence of another source. The Richardson-Vicks transaction has been named in government subpoenas related to the Boesky investigation.    In these and other transactions, Mr. Siegel learned the value of inside information in the day-to-day workings of mergers and acquisitions. He continued to listen to Mr. Boesky, even after he stopped giving him inside information. At the end of 1985, when the two met for their annual session, Mr. Boesky told Mr. Siegel that he wanted a written list of the deals Mr. Siegel had helped him on, indicating that he was disappointed in the arrangement. &quot;Don't you love me anymore?&quot; Mr. Boesky asked.    By then, Mr. Siegel had allegedly forged a far more valuable relationship, one in which he was able to tap into one of Wall Street's greatest repositories of inside information: Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    At Kidder Peabody, Mr. Siegel had developed into the model investment banker, idolized by many he worked with. The firm began having its annual summer party for interns at Mr. Siegel's home in Connecticut, the message being, as one participant recalls, &quot;that if you come to Kidder and work hard, you're going to be like Marty -- a beautiful home, beautiful wife, beautiful kids. It was like a stage set for 'The Great Gatsby.'&quot;    Mr. Siegel commuted from the house to lower Manhattan by helicopter. At home, he pursued his two hobbies, tennis and sailing on adjacent Long Island Sound. Colleagues say Mr. Siegel was never swept up into the fast-paced whirl of Manhattan society. &quot;He disdained the charity-ball set,&quot; says one friend. &quot;He was not a social climber. He didn't globe-trot. His main interest was his children.&quot; (In addition to a daughter, the Siegels had twins, a boy and a girl, who were born in 1985.)    Despite his growing success, Mr. Siegel was coming under mounting pressure from within Kidder Peabody. Many of its areas were not doing well, and many partners feared for the firm's future. In March 1984, Ralph DeNunzio, the firm's chief executive, told Mr. Siegel that in addition to his merger and acquisitions work, Mr. Siegel had to help create an arbitrage department. The firm allotted $30 million to that effort.    The directive seemed to undermine the &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; that is supposed to limit the exchange of information between arbitrage departments and mergers and acquisition departments at investment-banking firms. Evidently in recognition of the inherent conflicts in having the firm's top mergers and acquisitions specialist directly involved in trading on takeover rumors, Mr. DeNunzio also indicated that Mr. Siegel's involvement in arbitrage not be disclosed publicly; it never was. Indeed, when the government identified Mr. Siegel as the Kidder Peabody arbitrager it had previously identified only as &quot;CS-1,&quot; it came as a shock even to some Kidder Peabody employees who had no idea that Mr. Siegel was involved in arbitrage.    Repeated efforts to reach Mr. DeNunzio, both at home and in the office, over the holiday weekend were unsuccessful. A Kidder Peabody spokesman denies the account of Mr. DeNunzio's involvement. The spokesman says Mr. DeNunzio's role in arbitrage at Kidder Peabody &quot;is the same as any chief executive officer who supervises departments of a firm.&quot; Any inference that Mr. DeNunzio was aware of, or condoned, any misuse of inside information or other wrongdoing &quot;is false and absurd,&quot; the spokesman adds.    Despite pressures from the firm's officials to generate large profits, Kidder Peabody didn't have the resources to succeed at arbitrage. Assigned to officially head the new unit was Richard Wigton, generally regarded as a loyal but plodding trader; assigned to work with him was Timothy L. Tabor, a young and headstrong former accountant. (Messrs. Wigton and Tabor were among the three arrested by the government last week.) Mr. Siegel despaired that the unit could generate legitimate profits and complained at the time that his own role in arbitrage was untenable.    Apparently, the result was the alleged arrangement with Robert Freeman, the head of arbitrage at Goldman Sachs, who, when he was arrested by the government last week, was charged with entering into an agreement with Mr. Siegel to swap inside information. It was information that gave Mr. Siegel a tremendous edge in his own merger and acquisitions work. Mr. Freeman, too, became a highly valued strategist on Goldman Sachs merger deals.    The arrangement turned Kidder Peabody's arbitrage unit, virtually overnight, into one of the firm's principal profit centers. In an extraordinary first-year performance that aroused amazement within the firm, the arbitrage unit accounted for more than 25% of Kidder Peabody's pre-tax profits the first year it existed. Although that percentage declined slightly in subsequent years, the unit generated &quot;millions of dollars in illegal profits to Kidder,&quot; the government charged last week. Confidential profit figures from Kidder Peabody obtained by this newspaper show that arbitrage profits in 1985 were $6.9 million out of total profits of $47 million, or 15%, the firm's third-highest profit center. In 1984, arbitrage profits were also about $6.9 million out of a total profit of $39 million.    The alleged arrangement with Mr. Freeman seemed foolproof. The idea was that Kidder Peabody would trade on information from Goldman deals and that Goldman Sachs would trade on information from Kidder deals, so there were no obvious leaks within the firms. (The government, however, hasn't said whether there was any trading by Goldman Sachs on information Mr. Freeman allegedly received from Mr. Siegel. It did allege that Mr. Freeman traded in his own account, which, if true, breached the alleged understanding with Mr. Siegel.)    Moreover, arbitrage departments took positions in so many stocks rumored to be takeover targets that a few striking successes wouldn't appear unusual. There were no messy exchanges of cash, no unsavory-looking couriers. Goldman Sachs said last week that its own internal investigation suggests no wrongdoing on the part of either Mr. Freeman or the firm.    During 1985, as the alleged Goldman Sachs/Kidder Peabody scheme flourished, Mr. Siegel's communications with Mr. Boesky diminished. They didn't meet until the end-of-year session, and it didn't result in any more money changing hands. Mr. Boesky kept pressing hard for more information from Mr. Siegel, but Mr. Siegel resisted.    Then, in January 1986, Mr. Siegel decided to move to Drexel as co-head of its merger and acquisitions department, in part because the pressures of sustaining the Kidder Peabody arbitrage operation while building the firm's mergers and acquisitions practice had become nearly unbearable. Mr. Siegel arranged to meet again with Mr. Boesky, fearful that Mr. Boesky would be furious that he had made the decision without consulting Mr. Boesky. Mr. Boesky was furious, though apparently for reasons unrelated to Mr. Siegel's concerns. Dennis B. Levine, then an investment banker at Drexel, was already leaking inside information to Mr. Boesky; Mr. Siegel was far more valuable to Mr. Boesky at Kidder Peabody. (Last year, Mr. Levine pleaded guilty to four felony counts and is scheduled to be sentenced tomorrow.)    Even at that meeting, Mr. Siegel couldn't bring himself to tell Mr. Boesky that the relationship was over. Mr. Siegel's paranoia about the scheme had continued unchecked, and he increasingly viewed Mr. Boesky's swarthy, muscular couriers as potential hit men. Behind his usual cheerful, outgoing facade, Mr. Siegel lived in a state of fear.    But at Drexel, Mr. Siegel put insider trading behind him. He severed his ties with Mr. Freeman. He had come to Drexel to wed his defense expertise to Drexel's legendary financing capabilities, and the result was hugely successful. Mr. Siegel represented blue-chip clients like Lear-Siegler Inc., Holiday Corp. and Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. -- the kind of client Drexel desperately wanted to attract. Ironically, Goldman Sachs was furious when Goodyear, a longstanding Goldman Sachs client, insisted that both Drexel and Goldman Sachs represent it in its defense against a hostile bid by Sir James Goldsmith.    Last summer, Mr. Boesky tried several times to get in touch with Mr. Siegel. In August, almost exactly four years after their fateful Harvard Club meeting, Mr. Boesky called to say, &quot;I must meet with you&quot; to discuss their &quot;arrangement.&quot; Mr. Siegel resisted, then suggested a public place -- the Harvard Club. Mr. Boesky said it had to be private; Mr. Siegel declined. Mr. Boesky was presumably wired at the time, but the government never obtained convincing recorded evidence of Mr. Siegel's guilt.    On Nov. 14, the question of the government's evidence became moot. After news of Mr. Boesky's settlement with the government and after he sobbed in Mr. Lipton's office, Mr. Siegel determined almost immediately to plead guilty. He returned to Drexel's offices that evening, where, without going into details, he offered to take a leave of absence. Frederick H. Joseph, Drexel's chief executive, wouldn't hear of it, saying the firm would back him.    But Mr. Siegel's career was effectively over. Though he kept coming into the office, he ceased active participation in pending transactions. The Connecticut home he loved was hastily sold. He moved his family away from New York. He quickly agreed to the government's offer of a guilty plea to two felony counts; negotiations with the SEC over the financial terms of his settlement took longer. Under his agreement, he is paying $9 million to settle the charges. When he resigned from Drexel, he also forfeited approximately $11 million -- $7 million in compensation due him and about $4 million in Drexel stock.    On Friday morning Mr. Siegel, flanked by his lawyers, Mr. Rakoff and Audrey Strauss, appeared in Manhattan federal court. He was dressed like an investment banker in an expensive dark gray suit, blue shirt and red tie. Occasionally wiping tears from his eyes, Mr. Siegel pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to violate securities laws, as well as to one count of tax evasion for failing to declare the Boesky payoffs on his tax return.    Later, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and Gary Lynch, the SEC director of enforcement, held a crowded press conference to celebrate Mr. Siegel's guilty plea. Said Mr. Guiliani, &quot;His cooperation is very valuable, and Mr. Boesky's cooperation is very valuable. The value of this will be apparent as time goes on.&quot;    Mr. Siegel's negotiations with the U.S. Attorney's office didn't include any explicit promises to name others in the scandal, but he is cooperating fully in the government's continuing investigation. He is familiar with the inner workings of Kidder Peabody and has implicated Messrs. Wigton and Tabor. He is expected to provide testimony about the involvement of other Kidder Peabody executives in the firm's arbitrage activities as the government considers possible criminal charges against the firm.    To a lesser extent, Mr. Siegel is knowledgeable about the inner workings of Drexel, a firm also under investigation for reasons unrelated to Mr. Siegel's activities. As for Goldman Sachs, it is known that Mr. Siegel is not the government's principal witness against Mr. Freeman, but his testimony could be valuable corroboration if the government's case against Mr. Freeman goes to trial.    In addition, Mr. Siegel is intimately familiar with many important takeover deals, including the role inside information may have played in them. For government investigators, Mr. Siegel's guilty plea is thus the biggest coup since the capture of Mr. Boesky.    For his part, Mr. Siegel faces a maximum of 10 years in jail and a $260,000 fine on the two charges. He also settled, without admitting or denying guilt, SEC charges that he tipped Mr. Boesky about six takeover stocks. Mr. Siegel was permanently barred from working in the securities industry. In a statement read afterwards by Mr. Rakoff, Mr. Siegel said, &quot;I hope that, by accepting responsibility for my mistakes, I have begun to make up for the anguish I have caused my family, friends and colleagues.&quot;    In the end, it was Mr. Siegel, seemingly blessed with nearly every attribute for success, who was his own worst enemy. By embracing the use of inside information for personal gain, to advance his career, and to benefit his firm, Mr. Siegel sealed his fate. Mr. Siegel's fears that his career, like that of his father's, would end in financial ruin, proved self-fulfilling. </TEXT></DOC>
