(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four local middle school students aretraveling 5,000 miles for a hamburger and fries.   The students, members of an eighth grade civics class, areflying to the Soviet Union this week on an 11-day tour sponsored bySteel of West Virginia Inc.   They'll be free to do and see what they want in the Soviet Unionand Berlin, with one exception.   To make sure they understand the ins and outs of worldeconomics, the students must visit the Moscow McDonald's.   ``Just to drive it home to 14-year-olds, the only stipulation isthat they have to stand in line at McDonald's and buy ahamburger,'' said teacher and chaperone Jean McClelland.   Officials of Steel of West Virginia, which makes custom steelproducts, have been participating in a program in which localbusiness officials visit Ms. McClelland's civics classes once aweek to teach students about economics.   But while the other visitors have been content to provide giftsfor a school-sponsored auction at the end of the term, Steel ofWest Virginia's representatives opted for a more expensive present.The company is footing the $14,000 bill for the trip including airfare, lodging and the cost of obtaining passports.   ``We believe that we can have an impact upon the children ...that will affect them positively for the rest of their lives,''said Larry Gue, vice president of human affairs at Steel of WestVirginia. ``That's all we're looking for.''   He said the company picked the Soviet Union because of theeconomic lessons presented by the Moscow McDonald's: the differencebetween Huntington's McDonald's and its inexpensive fast food, andthe Moscow operation, where customers are willing to stand in linefor hours to spend a substantial part of their paycheck foressentially the same items.   ``The idea is hopefully they'll understand the American freeenterprise system,'' Gue said.   McClelland has 25 students in her civics class. The class cameup with the criteria their teacher used in picking the four winnersincluding attendance, grades and willingness to go new places andeat strange foods.   They also were given one week for research and then asked towrite an essay about the Soviet Union. Even the worst students gaveit a shot, McClelland said.   ``I had never, ever gotten essays of that quality before,'' shesaid.   One eventual winner, Jason Simms, wrote a paper titled ``Is theParty Over?'' Another, Sonja Meenach, wrote about communications inthe Soviet Union.   ``It's exciting and the chance of a lifetime,'' said anotherwinner, Sara Walker.   The group flies to New York on Steel of West Virginia'scorporate jet Wednesday, then catches a flight to Frankfurt, WestGermany, for a 5-hour layover and a connecting flight to Leningrad.   McClelland and the students will tour the Soviet Union for aweek, then travel to Berlin for three days before returning to theUnited States.   Although just four students were chosen for the trip, theirfellow students have been caught up in the excitement, McClellandsaid.   ``The whole school's been studying the Soviet Union,'' she said.``They've been having speakers, videos. Music classes have beenstudying Russian composers. Health classes have been studying jetlag. Even math classes have been studying how far it is to Moscow.''   During their trip, the students will make videotapes and attemptto call their classmates during class.   ``We wanted to share the experience,'' McClelland said. ``Wedidn't want to be selfish.''</TEXT></DOC>
