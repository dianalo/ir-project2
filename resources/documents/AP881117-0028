Documents released late Wednesday by the FBI said the magnetictapes were from the account of Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, a Cornellgraduate student in computer science who has told friends he createdthe virus program.   The program spread earlier this month throughout a number ofuniversity and military computer networks, disrupting theiroperation. Morris has said that he did not intend for it to invadecomputer systems around the nation.   According to the documents released Wednesday, U.S. DistrictJudge Gustave J. DiBianco in the northern district of New York inSyracuse issued two warrants on Nov. 10 for the Cornell searches.   The searches were conducted that same afternoon, the documentsindicate.   The government had said earlier that it might try to obtaindocuments from the university before interviewing Morris, andCornell's vice president for information technologies, M. StuartLynn, had said the university would cooperate fully with theinvestigation.   No charges have been filed in the case.   According to the FBI documents, investigators seized ``twomagnetic tapes labeled `files from Morris account including backups'and hard copy related thereto'' from Dean Krafft, a researchassociate in computer science at Cornell.   Federal agents also obtained ``two yellow legal pads withcalculus and assorted notes.'' An associate university counsel,Thomas Santoro, had taken the legal pads from an office in UpsonHall, a campus building that contains computer science classroomsand offices.   The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation to determinewhether statutes concerning wire fraud, malicious mischief orunlawful access to stored communications may have been broken withthe introduction of the virus into military and university computersystems.   A computer virus works by duplicating itself, spreading intoother programs in the computer and infecting one computer afteranother as users share floppy disks or link up over telephone lines.   Mild viruses may do nothing more than flash a provocative messageon a user's screen; ``deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple acomputer. Some are ``time bombs'' designed to wreak havoc on apre-programmed date.   The virus that infected 6,000 university and military computersnationwide this month apparently did its damage by rapidlyduplicating itself, thereby slowing computers' processing speed andtaking up their memory space.</TEXT></DOC>
