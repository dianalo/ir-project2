By a 62-38 vote, lawmakers provided a crucial endorsement of Mr. Bush's arms-control strategy of simultaneously developing two new, multibillion-dollar intercontinental ballistic-missile systems. The Senate went along with White House requests for $1.1 billion for the mobile MX and $100 million to proceed with design of the smaller Midgetman.    Partisan bickering prompted the House last week to gut Mr. Bush's missile proposals, making a resounding Senate vote essential in order to give the dual-track approach a chance to survive the House-Senate conference.    Yesterday's Senate action also breathed life into Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's effort to kill production of Grumman Corp.'s F-14 jet fighter.    But in an unexpected swipe at Northrop Corp.'s B-2 Stealth bomber, lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to distance themselves from the Pentagon's ambitious $70 billion plan for the radar-eluding planes. The Senate voted 93-7 to adopt a non-binding resolution warning the White House that it isn't currently &quot;prudent or possible to commit&quot; to large-scale B-2 purchases. The resolution also calls on the administration to consider whether &quot;significantly fewer&quot; B-2s should be built than the currently planned fleet of 132 bombers.    The fate of the MX and Midgetman missiles, the B-2 bomber and carrier-based F-14 fighters won't be decided until September, when Congress is scheduled to approve the final version of the $305 billion defense authorization bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.    Work on the Senate bill, which authorizes military spending and funds the Energy Department's nuclear weapons-making operations, proceeded as the House Appropriations Committee adopted a separate measure determining actual outlays by the Pentagon.    By voice vote, the Senate also approved an anti-drug amendment giving federal law-enforcement officials additional authority to force down private planes suspected of being used to smuggle narcotics. The measure authorizes officials, if all else fails, to fire at an aircraft if its pilot has refused to heed warnings to land.    As debate moved into the evening, there was widespread support for a trio of non-binding amendments intended to prod Japan, South Korea and Western European nations to shoulder a greater share of the allied defense burden.    On the MX issue, the Senate rejected an amendment, offered by Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), that would have cut over $500 million from the White House's $1.1 billion request for placing the missiles on specially equipped railroad cars. Sen. Levin proposed transferring most of the funds to keep open the F-14 production line on Long Island, New York.    Referring to a similar anti-MX amendment that passed the House, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) urged members to avoid &quot;that kind of unraveling over here.&quot; Knocking out funds to make the MX mobile would produce &quot;a totally illogical, unsound program&quot; of upgrading U.S. land-based missiles, he argued.    Despite shrinking Pentagon budgets, administration supporters contend that proceeding with both mobile missiles gives Mr. Bush maximum flexibility in arms-control talks with the Soviet Union.    But the White House has met with considerably less success in pressing its case for the B-2. Just last week, senators appeared ready basically to endorse administration plans that, among other things, envisioned B-2 production soaking up fully one-third of the Defense Department's overall aircraft-procurement budgets in the mid-1990s.    But in the past few days, the mood in the Senate has changed. During yesterday's debate, Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine) and others urged senators to go on record indicating that they haven't signed off on the full B-2 program. Noting that &quot;many Americans are understandably shocked&quot; and have complained to lawmakers about the estimated $530 million price tag for each bomber, Sen. Tim Wirth (D., Colo.) said the Senate should carefully assess alternatives, including much less expensive, radar-evading cruise missiles.    The Democratic and Republican managers of the defense bill supported language indicating that the Senate hasn't committed to B-2 production beyond the two or three aircraft likely to be funded in fiscal 1990.    Apparently responding to the public outcry over the cost of the B-2, the House last week adopted more-stringent language intended to suspend production until the administration agrees to deep cuts in the bomber program.    The Senate's action comes on the heels of White House lobbying for the B-2. Vice President Dan Quayle, for example, told reporters last month that U.S. arms-control positions would be jeopardized if the full B-2 fleet isn't built. &quot;Congress doesn't have any {other} game plan,&quot; Mr. Quayle said, to reach an arms-control agreement with the Soviets. &quot;They don't have anything better&quot; than the B-2, he asserted. </TEXT></DOC>
