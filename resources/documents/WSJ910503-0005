Itcontinues Amoco's strategy of selling mature properties withrelatively high operating costs in the U.S. as it focusesmore of its exploration and production efforts overseas.Amoco has been steadily selling U.S. reserves; in 1989, forexample, it sold a total of $322 million.   &quot;Many of these properties are relatively small for a verylarge company to operate effectively,&quot; said Patrick Early,president of Amoco's oil production unit. But independentslike Apache have been willing to bet they can operate thesefields for less than big companies.   In the transaction, Apache will pay Amoco $515 million incash and two million Apache shares, making Amoco Apache'slargest shareholder with a roughly 4.5% stake. Apache stockclosed yesterday at $15.875, up $2.125 in composite tradingon the New York Stock Exchange, putting a value of $31.8million on the stock portion of the purchase. Amoco finishedat $53.375, down 87.5 cents, in Big Board trading.   Apache officials said they have discussed the possiblityof offering Amoco a board seat. In addition to the cash andstock portion of the transaction, the two companies haveagreed to make certain adjustments to the sale price incoming years if oil prices fall above or below certainthreshholds.   Apache said the purchase will be underwritten through a$530 million credit facility it has with First Chicago Corp.and Chemical Banking Corp. In addition, Apache said it wouldtry to sell $150 million of oil and gas assets, includingsome of the Amoco properties, over the next 18 months toreduce debt. The company said it will cut debt another $50million in the period through cash flow.   The Amoco properties consist of 63 million barrels of oiland 288 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves located inseven states. Daily current production from these fieldsaverages 28,000 barrels of oil and 117 million cubic feet ofgas.   Apache's oil reserves will increase to 40% of its totalenergy reserves from 21%, the company said. &quot;We get a muchbetter balance,&quot; said Mr. Plank, the chairman, as well asbroader geographic diversity.</TEXT></DOC>
