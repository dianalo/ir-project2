At the end of 1987, therewas East-West agreement in Vienna on objectives and methods for theseCST talks. Briefly, the objectives are to strengthen security and stabilityin Europe through the establishment of a stable and secure balance ofconventional armed forces, which may include lower levels of conventionalarmaments and equipment; and the elimination of disparities prejudicialto stability and security, with priority on eliminating the capabilityto launch surprise attacks or initiate large-scale offensive action.These objectives are to be achieved through militarily significant measures,such as reductions, limitations, redeployment provisions, equal ceilings,and related measures. The achieve these objectives, measures will applyto the whole of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals, in a way whichprecludes circumvention. The CST agreement will provide, if necessary,for regional differentiation to address disparities within the area;that is, particular provisions may apply to certain areas within Europe,with Central Europe a likely candidate for such special attention. Agreementon general objectives is only the beginning. The actual start of negotiationsdepends on producing a fleshed-out negotiating mandate.</TEXT></DOC>
