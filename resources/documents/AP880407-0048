Mrs. Whitehead-Gould on Wednesday was immediately granted onesix-hour day of visitation with the 2-year-old child, MelissaStern, with the schedule expanded over the next year to includeovernights, holidays and a two-week vacation in the summer of 1989.</TEXT><HEAD>MELISSA'S BEST INTERESTS</HEAD><TEXT>   The court finds that Melissa's best interests will be served byunsupervised, uninterrupted, liberal visitation with her mother.</TEXT><TEXT>   She and her mother have the right to develop their own specialrelationship.</TEXT><HEAD>MARY BETH WHITEHEAD-GOULD</HEAD><TEXT>   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould had custody of Melissa and nurturedher for four months after her birth. Thereafter, she has seenMelissa on a regular, periodic basis until the present time. Theyhave a warm and loving relationship, interact well andappropriately, and stay engaged with each other over two-hourperiods under restrictive and confining circumstances.</TEXT><TEXT>   The court finds no credible evidence or expert opinion thatMelissa will suffer any psychological or emotional harm bycontinued and expanded visitation with her mother.   William and Elizabeth Stern offered no evidence to support theirfears that Melissa's continued relationship with her mother willsomehow adversely affect her development or jeopardize theirparent-child relationship.</TEXT><HEAD>WILLIAM AND ELIZABETH STERN</HEAD><TEXT>   William and Elizabeth Stern are extraordinarily good parents whoare devoting themselves to the nurturing and development of theirdaughter and their daughter is firmly bonded to them.</TEXT><TEXT>   (The Sterns) will be her parental role models and provide theday-to-day, parent-child interaction which will largely determinewhat kind of person Melissa will become. They will make theparental decisions concerning her religion, education, and moralstandards.</TEXT><TEXT>   William and Elizabeth Stern must accept and understand thatMelissa will develop a different and speciial relationship with hermother, stepfather, siblings and extended family and that theserelationships need not diminsh their parent-child relationship withMelissa.</TEXT><HEAD>MELISSA STERN</HEAD><TEXT>   Melissa is a resilient child who is no less capable thanthousands of children of broken marriages who successfully adjustto complex family relationships when their parents remarry.</TEXT><TEXT>   Melissa has no problems separating from her father andstepmother when brought to visitation, no separation anxiety duringthe two hours she is left with her mother, and no adverse reactionsto visitation after she has returned to her father and stepmother.</TEXT><HEAD>STRIFE BETWEEN STERNS AND MRS. WHITEHEAD-GOULD</HEAD><TEXT>   Melissa's adustment and the quality of her relationships withher parents and stepparents will depend largely on how well theyaccept and adjust their respective roles.</TEXT><TEXT>   The court does not underestimate the great difficulty theparties will have in accepting the others' role in Melissa's life.Family dreams have been shattered, insults and false accusationshave been exchanged, and lies and deceptions made in the heat oflitigation. However, family tragedies in our society are notuncommon and parents often are called upon to make sacrificesarising from unforeseen circumstances. In the context of familyproblems frequently seen by Family Court judges, the causes of theparties' estrangement do not appear insurmountable.</TEXT><TEXT>   The parties do not have the emotional scars of a failure of anintimate relationship intertwined with that of their child. Theyhave never been emotionally involved and should be able to makerational decisions in their mutual best interests and the bestinterest of Melissa.</TEXT><HEAD>PUBLICITY</HEAD><TEXT>   The parties have represented that they have no intention ofselling any ``movie rights'' they may have concerning ``Baby M'' asthe sale of such rights may permit the parites, Melissa, or theiractivies to be fictionally portrayed. Therefore, the court willrestrain and enjoin the parties from the sale of any such rightsthey may have without prior approval of the court.</TEXT><TEXT>   The court will not infringe on the parties' right to communicatepublicly on the issue of surrogate parenting and their personalexperiences so long as they do not affect Melissa's right toprivacy.</TEXT></DOC>
