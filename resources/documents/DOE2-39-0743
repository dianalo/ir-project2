<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0743 </DOCNO><TEXT>Three different levels of description are available to describe the interactionof electromagnetic radiation with electrons in a fully ionized plasma:when the scattering of radiation occurs by excitation of a plasmon, thecollective plasma oscillation of the electrons, it is called stimulatedRaman scattering; if it occurs by excitation of a heavily dampled plasmon,it is called stimulated Compton scattering, and if it occurs by excitationof individual electrons, it is called Compton scattering. The scatteringrates in each case differ significantly. The physics of these mechanismsis illustrated by taking a quasar as the source of intense radiationand the hot plasma surrounding it as the scattering medium. It is concludedthat, through Raman scattering, the non-thermal radio radiation equilibrateswith the intercloud medium at much higher temperatures than are achievablethrough Compton processes.</TEXT></DOC>
