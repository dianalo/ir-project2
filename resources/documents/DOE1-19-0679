Theimportant question of the distribution of the emission points and momentsis brought up: are these particles coming only from the region betweenthe fragments (the neck) or, are they coming with comparable probability,from any point of the surface of the fissioning system and: are theyemitted just at scission or at any sufficiently deformed stage of thefission process. The simultaneous division of the nucleus into threefragments (the true ternary fission) is discussed in terms of the dynamicalliquid-drop model. It is suggested that this process occurs in the tail(corresponding to overelongated shapes) of the distribution of the fissionprobability in the multidimensional space of the collective coordinates.</TEXT></DOC>
