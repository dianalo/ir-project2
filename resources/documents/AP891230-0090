The expulsion order from Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega was``clearly motivated by Nicaraguan desires to reduce the size of ourmission before Nicaraguan elections in February,'' the StateDepartment said in a statement.   ``By reducing our mission drastically, the Nicaraguan governmenthopes to curtail severely our ability to monitor the fairness andopenness of the elections,'' the statement said.   The wide array of weapons discovered during Friday's search ofthe residence were returned when U.S. troops determined they hadsearched the residence of a Nicaraguan diplomat, the StateDepartment said.   Shortly after the search, Ortega said 20 American diplomats werebeing expelled from Managua in retaliation for the incident.   Nicaragua's ambassador to Panama, Antenor Ferrey, said U.S.troops surrounded his residence in Panama City, ordered allpersonnel outside and searched the building for weapons.   The State Department said U.S. troops were ``reacting toreliable information regarding an arms cache'' when it searched theresidence. It was occupied by individuals who turned out to bemembers of the Nicaraguan diplomatic mission, the department said.   Ferrey had said five rifles were seized and later returned byU.S. troops with apologies, but the State Department said Saturdaythat U.S. troops located weapons ``in excess of normal requirementsfor defending the residence.''   The State Department said the cache included four Uzi machineguns, six rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 12 AK-47s, three handgrenades, 10 FEN rifles, 17 bayonets, one M-1 carbine, one shotgun,four rocket-propelled grenade sights, one light anti-tank weapon,27 rocket-propelled grenade rounds and approximately 1,300 roundsof ammunition of various caliber.   The residence was not damaged and there were no injuries to theoccupants, the department said, adding that the United States had``expressed our regrets'' about the incident.   The State Department declined to identify the expelleddiplomats, but Nicaragua's Foreign Ministry identified them as:Louis Falino, John S. Boarman, J. Warren Navarre, ChristopherMcMullen, Katherine M. Igmanson, Susan Kay Mutschler, Barbara M.Hamm, Jacqueline N. Dontric, William J. Overton, Robert L. Delves,John W. Fuhrer, Mary S. Gaber, Santiago Urieta, John Durham,Michael J. Weidmann, Frank R. Newland, Deolinda S. Armijo, John T.Torres, Pauline E. Davis and Valentino Martinez.
