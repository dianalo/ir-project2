The dollar had slipped Wednesday on speculation that such a move was in the works. Traders grew nervous when West German monetary officials, after complaining about the weakness of the mark, said Wednesday that they would hold a news conference yesterday. The rate increase by West Germany was a surprise, however, because some economists thought the Bundesbank wouldn't risk cooling its domestic economy.    The Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, increased its discount rate one-half percentage point, to 3.5%. Interest rates were also raised in Britain, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria and Switzerland. The sharpest increase was a one percentage-point rise by Britain. That nation's action followed a report that showed a bigger-than-expected British trade gap.    By boosting interest rates, the West European central banks are trying to make their currencies more attractive, and the dollar less attractive.    The dollar had risen strongly against the currencies of major industrial nations since the Federal Reserve Board Aug. 9 boosted its discount rate to 6.5% from 6% as part of a campaign against inflation.    Traders aren't sure how effective the campaign by the central banks will be against the dollar. Some expect it to weaken today, but they doubt that the banks' move is enough to spark a large liquidation of dollars held by investors. &quot;This is a real test of market psychology,&quot; an analyst said.    At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the West German mark futures contract for September delivery settled yesterday at 53.81 cents, up 0.53 cent.    In other commodity markets yesterday: -   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices puzzled analysts by easing, despite a weaker dollar and the concern about accelerating inflation raised by the revised second-quarter U.S. gross national product report. December gold futures contracts fell $2.20 to $442.20 an ounce, while September silver declined 7.5 cents to $6.7150 an ounce. October-delivery platinum was down $3.50 to $547.70 an ounce. Analysts confessed an inability to understand why precious metals didn't react to the Commerce Department's upward restatement of the second-quarter GNP price deflator (the adjustment applied to raw GNP figures in order to arrive at &quot;real&quot; growth). The department restated the second-quarter price deflator upward a full percentage point, to an annual rate of 5.1%. And analysts disagreed about whether the revised GNP figure was higher or lower than expected, too. Some suggested all the confusion might have unsettled the market and distorted price reactions, although the analysts agreed that the continuing lack of demand for physical gold and silver appears to be hindering strong moves in both metals' prices. One analyst said that precious metals seemed to take their direction from the weaker crude-oil market late in the day. Another analyst cited the rise in near-term interest rates as an additional factor keeping a lid on the market. Rate increases damp demand by increasing the cost of carrying precious metals investment positions, costs that precious metals investors normally have been willing to carry only when inflation is adding to the price of the metals, he noted.    ENERGY: Crude-oil futures fell in stepped-up trading on news that oil production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was surging. Output reached as much as 20 million barrels a day last week, a high for the year, according to the latest production surveys. Traders said that the market opened lower yesterday, and that the selling pressure didn't let up during the entire session. West Texas Intermediate for October delivery sank 37 cents a barrel, to close at $15.31 a barrel. Earlier, on European spot markets, North Sea Brent crudes were down about 25 cents a barrel.    COCOA: Futures prices eased, following weakness in London. December-delivery cocoa fell $45 a metric ton, to $1,328. An increase in the base lending rate in Britain touched off a sharp rally in sterling, which attracted arbitrage selling of cocoa futures there that dropped prices to an eight-year low, according to Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York. The weakness overseas helped depress New York futures prices to seven-year lows, she said. Slow seasonal demand for cocoa discouraged buying interest during the session, which had relatively quiet trading, she said. Miss Kaul observed that despite rumors to the contrary from time to time, which tend to depress prices, the Ivory Coast is holding fast to its policy of selling beans only at higher prices. The West African nation, the world's top producer, &quot;has about 135,000 tons on hand and it has only sold in dibs and dabs of 3,000 to 5,000 tons at a time,&quot; Miss Kaul said, adding that &quot;most important, it is making these sales at the fixed price . . . equal to about $500 a ton above New York market prices.&quot; She said, &quot;People aren't taking the high selling prices into consideration when they describe these sales as price depressants.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
