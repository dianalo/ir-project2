The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Wednesday that capital _representing the difference between loans and other assets andsavers' deposits and other liabilities _ edged up by $507 million inOctober following advances of $2.47 billion September and $6.11bilion in August.   Through the first 10 months of the year, Sandamp;L capital has risen by$2.94 billion, compared with a loss of $3.07 billion in the sameperiod of 1987.   The bank board began increasing the pace of Sandamp;L rescues inmid-August. Rescues in effect wipe out the red ink of the failedinstitutions by transferring it to the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., the agency that insures deposits up to $100,000.   The agency has dealt with more than 150 troubled institutions sofar this year.   Meanwhile, deposits increased by $390 million in October,representing the first net increase in deposits since April.   The October net increase in deposits represented a sharp contrastto net withdrawals of $2 billion in September. A year earlier, therewas a much larger deposit increase of $6.17 billion, when investorssought a safe haven for their money after the October 1987 stockmarket crash.   The assets of federally insured Sandamp;Ls, made up primarily of loans,grew at an annual rate of 9.5 percent in October, down from an 11percent growth rate in September.   Abouth three-fourths of the asset growth in October reflected a$7.8 billion increase in mortgage holdings, including purchases ofmortgage-backed securities. This followed a September increase of$4.7 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
