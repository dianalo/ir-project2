At the meeting, the finance ministers are to carry outtheir regular &quot;surveillance&quot; of the 12 EC economies. Thefocus is likely to be on Germany's high interest rates and oneconomies such as those of Italy, Spain and Ireland, whichare moving especially slowly towards meeting the criteria formonetary union set out in the Maastricht Treaty in December.</LP><TEXT>   EC foreign and finance ministers met Friday in Maastrichtto sign the final version of the treaty, which sets out stepstowards economic, monetary and political union.   Just before the signing, the Bundesbank issued a statementin Frankfurt declaring that monetary union is flawed withouta political union to set down rules to better align thefiscal and social policies of EC governments.   &quot;Agreement on the future structure of a political union toparallel monetary union hasn't emerged from the Maastrichtaccords,&quot; the Bundesbank said, adding that political union isof &quot;central importance&quot; if monetary union is to be tenable.   The latest Bundesbank call for better convergence ofgovernment policies affecting currencies and interest ratescomes amid growing concern in Germany that Bonn is moving tooquickly to give up the mark, without ensuring that areplacement currency won't be undermined by othergovernments. As a symbol of currency stability, theBundesbank could serve as a rallying point for German popularopinion as monetary union draws closer.   In its statement, the Bundesbank said it worries aboutplans for a special &quot;social cohesion fund&quot; under which poorercountries will be bolstered by financial transfers from theunion's richer members. The German central bank particularlyobjects to fixation on set timetables that might compel somecountries to enter the currency union before they are ready.It repeated its concern that political pressures could resultin rule-bending when it comes to appraising whether acandidate country meets the stiff economic criteria foradmission into the currency union.   When presenting the position paper at a brief newsconference Friday, Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesingersought to depict the Bundesbank's role as a concerned party,asserting that the framework for monetary and political unionrequired political decisions by EC governments andparliaments.   Officials in Brussels and at other EC capitals said theBundesbank's well-known warnings risked losing their impact,especially since they seemed to ignore decisions that hadalready been taken by elected political leaders of ECcountries. The Bundesbank's doubts over the agreed timetablefor introducing the EC currency were &quot;arrogant andunnecessary,&quot; a Brussels-based diplomat said.   One EC official, who shares many of the Bundesbank'sconcerns about convergence, said the German central bank was&quot;beginning to sound like a broken record.&quot; He said while theBundesbank's influence in the coming debate was unchallenged,its constant nay-saying would do little to inspire confidencein the EC's monetary plans. &quot;We have committed ourselves tomonetary union and we have set a timetable for doing it,&quot; theofficial said. The Bundesbank won't be able &quot;to wish away&quot;the Maastricht treaty, he added.   A British official said he was pleased that the Bundesbanklaid emphasis on the need for close convergence of ECeconomies before proceeding with monetary union. But he saidBritain didn't share the Bundesbank's concern about politicalunion. The important thing is that the EC maintain a systemof economic and financial discipline. He said that marketpressures would have an important effect on keeping countriesfrom conducting irresponsible economic or budgetary policies,because badly managed economies would have difficulty raisingfunds on international capital markets.   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the Maastrichttreaty had resulted in acceptable and workable compromises.&quot;I think we can make it work,&quot; he said at the treaty-signingceremonies in Maastricht Friday.   German Finance Minister Theo Waigel also expressedconfidence in the monetary union treaty, saying that thewhole Community would soon have the same inflation-fightingmonetary system that has reigned in Germany for most of theperiod since World War II.   &quot;The task to secure monetary stability has been formulatedeven more clearly than for the Deutsche Bundesbank,&quot; Mr.Waigel said at the Maastricht ceremonies.</TEXT></DOC>
