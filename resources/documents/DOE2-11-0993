The objective of this feasibilitystudy was to find out if reliable results can be expected from a researchproject with this topic. The precondition for generating quantitativecoherences between the development of the environment pollution whichhas started and the economic and technologic development of the nationaleconomy is the availability of representative time series over long yearsrelating to indicators of environment pollution (e.g. immission, emissions).A review of the data revealed that this is only the case of the environmentmedia air, surface waters, sediments and, with some restrictions, groundwater. A result-oriented main investigation is, with some restrictions,estimated to be feasible. The results will not be able to give us a completepicture of the reciprocity of economic growth and environment pollution;it will be possible, however, for some important environment media, toderive reliable statements about the impact of economic activity andtechnological changes on partial pollutions.
