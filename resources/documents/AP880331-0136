(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggartreportedly said preacher Oral Roberts freed him of ``demons withlong fingernails'' digging into his body before Swaggart decided todefy his church and return to the pulpit.   Swaggart, accused of motel trysts with a prostitute, intends toreturn to the pulpit May 22, three months after stepping down,BillTreeby, his lawyer and a board member of Jimmy Swaggart WorldMinistries, said Wednesday.   Swaggart said several weeks ago that he has undergone extensiveprayer and counseling with Roberts, the Rev. Mike Evans of Euless,Texas, Swaggart's friend and a fellow TV evangelist, said in atelevision interview Wednesday.   ``And he said to me that Oral Roberts called him up and told himthat he saw demons with long fingernails digging their flesh intoJimmy Swaggart's body and that he cast those demon spirits out ofJimmy Swaggart,'' Evans said.   Evans told Dallas television station WFAA he did not knowwhether Roberts' counseling led to Swaggart's plans to resumepreaching May 22, but said that Swaggart feels the process hasfreed him of his sin.   ``I am proud to confirm that,'' Oral Roberts' son, Richard, toldthe television station.   Gus Weill, a spokesman for Swaggart, said today that Roberts hadspoken to the evangelist only once.   ``Rev. Oral Roberts is one of hundreds and hundreds of ministerswho have called Rev. Swaggart to pray with him and he deeplyappreciates those calls,'' Weill said. ``He spoke to Rev. Robertsabout four weeks ago and that was the only time he called him.''   Swaggart's return May 22 coincides with the end of a three-monthsuspension by the church's Louisiana council. The national church'sGeneral Presbytery on Tuesday overruled that term as too lenientand barred him from the pulpit for at least a year and ordered himto undergo two years of rehabilitation and counseling.   Treeby said there was a conflict within the Assemblies, thenation's largest Pentecostal denomination, over whether thenational presbytery or the Louisiana council has the right todiscipline ministers.   ``He is willing to submit himself to the Louisiana District,''Treeby told a televised news conference at Swaggart's headquartershere. ``He will be considering an appeal to the nationalPresbytery.''   However, Juleen Turnage, a spokeswoman for the national officeof the Assemblies in Springfield, Mo., said Swaggart's option toreturn after three months ``does not exist anymore.''   ``The General Presbytery overwhelmingly and without a dissentingvote affirmed the authority of the Executive Presbytery to makedecisions on matters concerning ministerial credentials,'' she saidWednesday.   The 13-member Executive Presbytery acts as the church's board ofdirectors, while the 232-member General Presbytery is its oversightbody.   The Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, the Assemblies' generalsuperintendent, said Tuesday that if Swaggart did not accept itsruling, ``the Executive Presbytery would no doubt take action todismiss him.''   Church officials originally said Swaggart had 30 days to appealthe terms of his rehabilitation. However, Mrs. Turnage saidWednesday church bylaws provide for an appeal only in cases ofdismissal, not suspension.   Asked if a year away from the pulpit would ruin Swaggart'slucrative ministry, Treeby said, ``He is weighing all thoseconsiderations very carefully.''   The ministry has said it took in $150 million in 1986 from itsworldwide operations, including sales. It contributes an estimated$12 million a year to the Assemblies' foreign missions program.   Louisiana Assemblies officials have close ties to Swaggart'schurch, television and Bible school enterprise. Cecil Janway,superintendent of the Louisiana district, also sits on the board ofJimmy Swaggart World Ministries.   Although the Executive Presbytery interrupted its regularbimonthly meeting to watch Treeby's news conference, ``We don'tconsider that we've heard from Jimmy Swaggart, because we don'tcommunicate through television news conferences with ourdisciplined ministers,'' Mrs. Turnage said.   Swaggart tearfully stepped down from the pulpit on Feb. 21 afterconfessing an unspecified sin. Church officials later said they hadseen photographs of the evangelist with a prostitute in a motelroom.   According to the Presbytery's terms of rehabilitation, Swaggartmust stop preaching and distributing videotaped sermons for atleast one year, and undergo counseling and supervision by churchelders for two years.   Swaggart is the latest evangelist to be forced from the pulpit.His accuser, Marvin Gorman, was forced from the Assemblies of Godwhen he admitted to an immoral act with a woman. Jim and TammyBakker were forced from their PTL ministry in a scandal thatincluded a sexual encounter between Bakker and former churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.</TEXT></DOC>
