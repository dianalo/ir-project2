North's motion to be tried separatelyfrom his three co-defendants.   The legal status of McFarlane, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanorcharges of withholding information from Congress about secretReagan administration aid to Nicaraguan Contra rebels, wasmentioned in a footnote to North's request for a separate trial.   The names of the unindicted co-conspirators in the case havebeen sealed by the court.   The defense brief, along with naming McFarlane, identifies theother unindicted co-conspirators as Fawn Hall, North's formersecretary at the National Security Council; Joe Fernandez, a formerCIA agent also known as Tomas Castillo, and Marine Lt. Col. RobertEarl, North's aide at the NSC.   Hall and Earl are cooperating with the investigation byindependent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh under grants of immunity fromprosecution.   Neither McFarlane's lawyer, Leonard Garment, nor James Wieghart,a spokesman for Walsh, would comment on the defense revelations.   North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter, andarms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. RichardV. Secord, all asked to be tried separately on charges stemmingfrom their involvement in the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-saleprofits to the Contras.   In their motions for separate trials, the defendants said theywanted to use the congressional testimony of their co-defendants toprove their innocence.   A joint trial of all four defendants would unfairly prejudicethe case against them because all the defendants, except Secord,testified before Congress under limited grants of immunity fromprosecution, the defense said.   ``The court must grant each defendant a separate trial toprotect both the Fifth Amendment right of defendants North,Poindexter and Hakim to be tried before a jury that has not beenexposed to their immunized testimony or its fruits, and the SixthAmendment right of each defendant to use the immunized testimony ofhis co-defendants and its fruits in his defense,'' North's lawyerssaid in their brief.   The lawyers for North, a former NSC aide, noted a furthercomplication involving McFarlane, who returned to the Iran-Contracommittee last year for additional questioning following North'sappearance.   The defense noted that Walsh acknowledged in a staff memo lastsummer that McFarlane's testimony ``was likely tainted'' because itwas given ``in direct response to Lt. Col. North's immunizedtestimony.''   ``The IC (independent counsel) has also made clear thatMcFarlane, an alleged unindicted co-conspirator, will be a keyprosecution witness,'' the North brief said. ``Lt. Col. North'sco-defendants are certainly entitled to cross-examine McFarlaneabout his tainted testimony.''   McFarlane was identified in the defense brief as an unindictedco-conspirator in the conspiracy to defraud the government countthat charges all four defendants. The brief says Ms. Hall,Fernandez and Earl are also unindicted co-conspirators in thatcount of the indictment.   McFarlane, who resigned as national security adviser in late1995, traveled with North to Tehran in May 1986 on a plane thatdelivered spare parts for Hawk missiles. McFarlane carried a Biblesigned by President Reagan and a cake in the shape of a key thatwere presented to the Iranians in the negotiations to free hostagesheld in Lebanon in exchange for arms sales to Iran.   McFarlane, who is also cooperating with Walsh's investigation,could receive a prison sentence of up to four years and a $400,000fine for his guilty plea to misdemeanor charges of withholdinginformation from various congressional committees that inquiredinto covert aid to the Contras during a ban on direct U.S. militaryassistance.   In other developments in the case, the prosecution made anotherstab at obtaining nearly 3,000 pages of diaries that North keptwhile he was at the NSC.   The recently retired Marine lieutenant colonel last week invokedthe Fifth Amendment when the diaries were subpoenaed by a SenateForeign Relations subcommittee.   Walsh, who has unsuccessfully tried to subpoena the material,asked that they be produced as part of pre-trial discovery for``any and all notebooks, journals or ledgers kept by thedefendants.''   The request also included documents of financial transactionsinvolving a series of companies used by Hakim and Secord to brokerarms to the Iranians and to ferry materiel to the Nicaraguan rebels.   Walsh also accused the defense of ignoring U.S. District JudgeGerhard A. Gesell's order to specifically challenge the applicationof the Classified Information Procedures Act to the case.   The law sets out procedures for disclosure of secret governmentdocuments during a criminal trial. Walsh has amassed some 300,000pages of classified documents in his investigation.   Walsh contended that the defense ``did not attempt tosubstantiate the specific problems'' they had identified withcomplying with the law raising instead ``hypothetical and abstractarguments'' about the law's constitutionality.</TEXT></DOC>
