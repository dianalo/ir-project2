These vehicles areknown by several names, e.g., camp cars, outfit cars, and bunk cars. Forconvenience, these vehicles are referred to as ``camp cars'' in this noticeand proposed rule. The units range from modular homes mounted on flat carsto converted passenger and freight cars. There are approximately 1,309flat cars, 422 converted passenger cars, and 1,869 converted freight cars.Nearly all are used by six Class I railroads: Atchison, Topeka and SantaFe, Burlington Northern, Conrail, CSX Transportation Systems, Norfolk andWestern, and Union Pacific.Under current industry practice, sizable groups of workers are organizedin so called ``production gangs'' to improve the speed, quality, and efficiencywith which large scale maintenance can be accomplished. Such a group willmove progressively over that section of rail line on which work is beingdone. This is typically seasonal work that must be accomplished while weatherpermits. Railroads need to house workers in reasonable proximity to thework site; in many areas of the country, no feasible alternatives exist.Railroads assemble groups of workers and mechanized (on-rail) equipmentand assign a certain number of cars outfitted as mobile living quarters.That collective unit will station itself at a given site and perform itswork. At the end of the work day, crews return to the site of the sleepingquarters. In this notice, FRA is proposing to require the use of certainoperating procedures to protect railroad workers housed in such on-trackvehicles.Camp cars are generally parked in yards. When space allows, they are placedon tracks to which they have exclusive access. However, in many cases campcars must be located on tracks where switching is performed or to whichother carrier equipment requires access.When camp cars share a track or siding with other equipment, there is therisk that the cars will be struck by rolling stock and that the occupantswill be injured. A number of railroads have rules addressing this hazard.However, the level of protection varies among railroads and FRA observationsindicate that adherence to such rules is sporadic.Current FRA regulations governing railroad operating practices, 49 CFRPart 218, prescribe rules for protection of railroad employees assignedto inspect, test, and repair rolling stock. This proposed amendment tothose rules would extend similar protection to workers occupying camp cars.Section 19(c) of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 (RSIA) (Pub. L.100-342) states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary shall, within one year after the date of the enactmentof this Act, amend part 218 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, toapply blue signal protection to on-track vehicles where rest is provided.</ITAG>The purpose of this provision is to require that the same type of protectionnow provided to workers on rolling stock be provided to maintenance-of-way,signal, and bridge and building workers. However, FRA's proposal does differin some respects from both the existing regulatory formulation and fromother existing methods for protecting rail workers because of the particularsafety concerns that are present in this situation.In formulating its proposal, FRA examined three distinct but related effortsto address the safety problems that are the focus of the legislative concern:(1) The historical industry approach to analogous safety concerns, nowembodied in FRA's blue signal provisions in Part 218; (2) the current individualrailroad practices for worker protection; and (3) a joint recommendationsubmitted by a labor-management task force. FRA's proposal blends elementsfrom each of these sources.FRA is particularly grateful for the very timely efforts made by the Associationof American Railroads (AAR) and the Brotherhood of Maintenance-of-Way Employes(BMWE). In the brief interval since the legislation was enacted, an AARand BMWE task force has agreed on an approach to this issue and providedFRA with detailed written suggestions about ways to resolve virtually allof the issues raised in connection with this proposal. Many of these suggestionshave been incorporated in this proposal. The BMWE/AAR submitted some suggestionsthat FRA believes are separate and distinct from those it intended to addressin this rulemaking. One, a prohibition against humping occupied camp carsor flat switching them without being coupled to a locomotive, was so importantthat it is included in this proposal. Another suggestion was to createa 25-foot ``envelope'' around camp cars to protect them from movementson adjacent tracks, at least movements in excess of a designated speed.FRA has not included a proposal on this subject because it goes beyondthe mandate of the statute and because FRA does not have sufficient informationon the need for or parameters of such protection. Commenters, however,are invited to address this issue.FRA's basic safety purpose in this rule is to protect rail workers whenthey are occupying camp cars that have been parked on main track or otherthan main track. In such circumstances, the occupants of that equipmenthave a reasonable expectation that the equipment will not be unexpectedlymoved. If the equipment is unexpectedly moved, the workers risk being injuredor killed. In one such instance, a freight train collided with severalcamp cars resulting in injuries to twenty-two people, including the fourcrew members of the locomotive and 18 maintenance-of-way employees. Thecause was a failure to close a switch on the main track.Since the camp cars themselves are not capable of self-propulsion, movementof these cars results either from the use of a locomotive or from the impactof other cars entering the track occupied by the camp cars. It is the riskposed by unanticipated movement of this nature that FRA is addressing inthis NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="84">Current Practices</ITAG>Rail workers whose duties cause them to be on, under, or between rollingequipment for purposes such as inspecting, testing, or repairing that equipmenthave historically been afforded a method of protection that is commonlydenominated as ``blue flag'' protection. The essential elements of thismethod of protecting workers are placing a warning signal near the endsof the equipment being worked on and physically limiting access to thesegment of track on which such equipment is located. FRA has establishedclear minimums concerning each basic element of that method in SubpartB of Part 218.Rail workers who occupy camp cars have historically been afforded varyingmethods of protection. This diversity is reflected in the current individualrailroad practices that FRA examined in preparing this proposal. When specificsystem-wide methods for protecting such workers have been in effect, mostrailroads employed both a warning signal and some form of physical accessdeterrent.Building on that historical precedent, the BMWE/AAR recommended use ofboth a warning signal and physical impediments to prevent the unanticipatedmovement of occupied camp cars.<ITAG tagnum="84">FRA's Proposal</ITAG>Where railroads currently provide blue signal protection to camp cars,most use a white signal with black lettering warning of the camp cars'presence. We are aware, however, of at least one carrier which uses a bluetinted signal. In drafting the proposed rule, we considered the optionof requiring one type of sign, while permitting the alternative colorationif the signal was otherwise deployed in accordance with the regulation.We were concerned, however, that permitting various railroads to use differentcolored signals for camp car protection would create a safety hazard, especiallywhere a train crew operates over another railroad's territory. We notethat adoption of a uniform tint could create at least a short-term riskon carriers required to shift to that coloration. But the proposal setforth in this notice is premised on the belief that there is less dangerin requiring one, or a small number, of carriers to experience a short-termadjustment than there is in allowing a system of differing color codesto exist over the long-term.The blue tint is recognized throughout the industry as a warning that movementbeyond the signal will create a hazard of death or injury to workers onor about equipment on that track, and as a requirement to obtain the permissionof those workers prior to any such movement. However, signals colored blueare normally employed for only relatively brief periods (hours rather thandays) and only to denote a particular class of hazards (i.e., that workersare on, under, or between rolling equipment on that track). Uniform colorcoding of hazard signals is a long tradition in the railroad industry.Orange identifies a rear-end marker; yellow is used by many carriers forderails, and red represents a ``stop signal.'' The color blue has longbeen associated with a particular risk_workers on, under, or between rollingequipment on an occupied track_and we are concerned that its use for longperiods in relationship to a different class of hazards could promote confusioncounterproductive to the safety objectives of this proposal. We are alsoconcerned that using the color blue to denote differing hazards could underminethe employees' confidence in the reliability of color coding for otherhazards. Finally, we believe_subject to the receipt of comments in thisproceeding_that more carriers use a white lettered disk to identify campcars than a blue tinted warning, meaning that the adoption of a white diskwill require less adjustment than endorsement of the color blue. As a consequence,the proposal in this notice specifies use of the white disk. However, FRAsolicits public comment on this issue.One final concern about the signal is the need to illuminate the device.Given the fact that workers tend to occupy camp cars during darkness andthat such equipment contains a ready source of electrical power, FRA isproposing that the signal be illuminated during darkness. FRA welcomescomment on this aspect of the proposal as well as on the benefits or problemspresented by any of these or other possible options, including an explanationof how the option would comport with the statutory mandate.The placement of a warning signal alone does not provide a sufficient levelof protection for workers in camp cars. Any number of circumstances canrender that signal ineffective. Oversight, inattention, inadvertent removal,and vandalism are some of the more common illustrations of what can nullifythe effectiveness of such devices. FRA, therefore, is proposing to supplementthe signal display with at least one method for physically limiting accessto the track on which the camp cars are parked.Any track on which camp cars are parked will be connected on at least oneend to some other track. FRA proposes to physically restrict movement onthe segment of track on which the camp cars are located by controllingsuch connections that could provide other cars or locomotives access tothe camp cars. Physical restriction of access to the camp cars would occureither through placement of a locked derail at a specified distance fromthe end of the camp cars or by having the connecting switches lined awayfrom the segment of track occupied by the camp cars and locked in thatposition. The derails or switches would have to be locked with an effectivelocking device. FRA previously defined such locking devices as excludinglocks that multiple parties can operate, such as the typical switch lock.FRA's definition of this term requires a special lock that is controlledonly by the workers who are being protected by it. <T3>See</T3> 49 CFR 218.5(d). FRA previously discussed the meaning of thisprovision when it adopted the current rules (44 FR 2175, January 10, 1979).In essence, FRA proposes to employ the same procedures for limiting accessthat are contained in its existing rules but with one important difference.The procedures for physically limiting access to the segment of track occupiedby camp cars will be applied regardless of whether the cars are parkedon main track or other than main track. FRA is mindful of the fact thatthe most common form of protection is spiking the switch providing accessto the track where camp cars are located; this is currently done by fiveof the six major railroads. Some also require that the switch be locked,and at least two railroads require placement of a derail to avert the chanceof rolling equipment striking the occupied cars. The BMWE/AAR suggestedapproach would require that switches be locked and spiked. FRA's proposaldoes not incorporate the use of multiple levels of protection because FRAdoes not believe that such redundancy is required in a Federally mandatedminimum standard and because experience has demonstrated that compliancewith our existing rules establishes effective protection for workers undersimilar circumstances. That is, an ``effective locking device'' meetingthe regulatory definition of that term makes additional protection superfluous.FRA did consider making spiking an alternative to use of a lock, but concludedthat since a spike can be removed by anyone, while the effective lockingdevice can be removed only by those benefiting from the protection, thespike would not provide the same degree of protection. Railroads can, ofcourse, do both pursuant to railroad rules or collective bargaining agreements.However, FRA welcomes comment on this issue.FRA proposes to deviate from its existing regulatory approach to addressthe fact that camp cars, unlike employees assigned to work on, under, orbetween rolling equipment, tend to remain in a single location for lengthyperiods of time. FRA proposes to follow the practice of several railroadsand require that the dispatcher be notified of camp car placement. FRAproposes to allow the dispatcher flexibility in alerting operating personnelabout the presence of the camp cars rather than dictate the manner in whichthat information will be disseminated. At present, one railroad issuestrain orders indicating the location of cars and the others use a combinationof measures to notify affected personnel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>FRA proposes to add a new subpart E that would include the provisions relatingto camp cars. FRA recently initiated another rulemaking to prohibit tamperingwith locomotive safety devices that will become subpart D of this regulation(see the August 31, 1988 issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 53 FR 33786). FRA also proposes to add a newdefinition to existing andSection;218.5 to define the type of rolling equipmentto which this subpart applies.  Section 218.61 would state the scope of the subpart.  Section 218.63 would require that a signal be displayed whenever such carsare designated for occupancy, not only when crews would normally be restingor off-duty (such cars are also used to provide meals for crews or to housesick or injured workers). When such signals are displayed, cars could notbe coupled to other rolling equipment or moved. As noted earlier, FRA proposesthat this signal be a white disk with the works ``Occupied Camp Car'' inblack lettering. This section would also indicate who is authorized todisplay or remove such signals.  Section 218.65 would require that each switch providing access to the segmentof track where camp cars are located be lined and secured with an effectivelocking device and tagged with an appropriate signal. This requirementwould apply regardless of whether camp cars are located on main track orother than main track. FRA proposes to employ the same definitions forwhat constitutes ``switch providing access,'' ``main track,'' and ``effectivelocking device'' that it currently employs for blue signal protection provisionsof these rules. This section also contains FRA's proposal of notificationthat camp cars are occupying a segment of track.  Section 218.69 would provide alternative methods of protection for occupiedcamp cars covered under andSection;218.67. When railroad operations demandthat a portion of the track be used by other equipment, FRA is proposingto sanction the use of derails to subdivide the track in question, justas the current blue signal rules permit in servicing areas. Camp cars locatedon tracks where switching occurs or where other rolling equipment has accesscould be protected by use of a portable derail placed 150 feet from theend of the camp car and by use of the required signal. If speed withinthe area is restricted to not more than five miles per hour, a derail,capable of restriction access to that portion of the track where the occupiedcamp cars are located, will satisfy the requirements of a manually operatedswitch when placed at lease 50 feet from the end of the equipment to beprotected by the appropriate signal. When derails are so used, they mustbe locked with an effective locking device and flagged with an appropriatesignal.  Section 218.67 contains the details of how protection would be establishedin areas where remotely controlled switches are present. The designatedperson, normally the camp car foreman, must notify the operator of theswitches that camp cars have been placed in the area. The operator of eachremotely controlled switch must inform the designated camp car employeethat each switch has been lined against movement to that track and locked.The operator of each remotely controlled switch shall maintain for 15 daysa written record of each notification with the requisite information. Thisproposal varies from FRA's approach to remotely controlled switches underthe current blue signal rule in two ways. First, the retention period forthis written record remains the same, but the retention period does notcommence until the operator has been notified that protection is no longerneeded. Second, FRA proposes to modify slightly its methods of physicalprotection when the access switch is a remotely controlled switch. As notedearlier, FRA's current blue signal rule implicitly contemplated only relativelybrief time periods when the use of a remotely controlled switch would beconstrained. Since the locking devices for such switches do not have thesame level of physical security as the locks required for manual switches,FRA is concerned that, with the passage of an extended period of time,such a remotely controlled switch could be inadvertently activated. FRAproposes to address this possible occurrence by requiring that a lockedderail be installed at least 150 feet from the end of the camp cars ifthe cars remain on main track for more than 48 hours.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Economic and Regulatory Impact  </ITAG>E O. 12291 and DOT Regulatory Policies  The proposed rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing policiesand procedures. It is considered to be a non-major rulemaking under ExecutiveOrder 12291 but significant under DOT policies and procedures (44 FR 11034;February 26, 1979).  At present, railroads own an estimated 3,637 camp car type vehicles. Ofthis total, approximately 90 percent are owned by the following carriers,ordered by size of fleet: Burlington Northern (901), CSX (730), Conrail(539), Union Pacific (486), Norfolk and Western (362), and Santa Fe (327).These six railroads comprise the majority of the activity as well as ownershipof camp cars. The remaining 10 percent of camp cars are owned by 16 carriers,with none of these carriers owning more than 70 camp cars, or 2 percentof the total camp car fleet.  The majority of camp cars are currently afforded sufficient protection.The proposed rule will further reduce the accident risk by mandating moreuniform safety procedures for protecting workers housed in camp cars. Projected potential benefits of the proposed rule are based on avoidanceof accidents. Historical data from FRA shows one major accident in thelast ten years. Track and property damage from the accident amounted to$36,550 and 22 injuries (4 crew members and 18 maintenance of way employees).Each injured employee was estimated to be absent from work an average ofalmost 17 days, but at this time the injury costs have not been quantified.The projected potential costs from the proposed rule are also expectedto be minimal. Cost impacts will be limited to purchases of additionalequipment that may be needed by carriers not already complying with theplanned regulatory action. It is estimated that manufacture and illuminationof the proposed signal device will be $94.95 per commercial device andapproximately $20.00 per carrier made device. The 760 estimated devicesinclude all cases and may well overstate the actual cost of the proposal.Nevertheless, the total cost of this estimate does not exceed $34,178,assuming that a third of the devices are manufactured commercially andthe remaining two thirds are produced by the carriers. There will be minimalcosts resulting from the recordkeeping provisions. This rule will not havea significant economic impact since the basic protection mandated in theRail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 is already practiced by most carriersusing camp cars. With no notable changes in potential benefits and costs, a draft regulatoryevaluation has not been prepared; however, the agency invites commentson costs and benefits expected to be incurred. Regulatory Flexibility Act These proposed regulations will not have any economic impact on small entities.FRA therefore certifies that this proposal will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed rule has information collection requirements. FRA is submittingthese information collection requirements to the Office of Management andBudget for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Any commentsof these information collection requirements should be provided to Mr.Gary Waxman, Regulatory Policy Branch, Office of Management and Budget,New Executive Office Building, 726 Jackson Place, N.W., Washington, DC20503. Copies of any such comments should also be submitted to the docketof this rulemaking at the address provided above. Environmental Impact The proposed rule will not have any identifiable environmental impact.<ITAG tagnum="81">Federalism Implications </ITAG>This proposed rule will not have a substantial effect on the states, onthe relationship between the states and the national government, or onthe distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparationof a Federalism Assessment is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 218 </ITAG>Occupational Safety and Health Penalties, Railroad employees, Railroads,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation </ITAG>Interested persons are invited to participate in this proceeding by submittingwritten data, views, or comments. Communications should identify the regulatorydocket number and the notice number and must be submitted in triplicateto the Docket Clerk, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration,400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Persons desiring acknowledgementthat their submissions save been received should attach a stamped pre-addressedpostcard to the first page of each submission. Comments received beforeMarch 22, 1989, will be considered before final action is taken on theproposed rule. All comments received will be available for examinationby interested persons at any time during regular working hours in Room8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. In addition, FRA will conduct a public hearing at 10:00 a.m. on April 5,1989, in Room 2230, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC. The hearingwill be informal. There will be no cross-examination of persons makingstatements. A staff member of FRA will make an opening statement outliningthe subject matter for the hearing. Interested persons will then have theopportunity to present their oral statements. At the completion of allinitial oral statements, those persons who wish to make rebuttal statementswill be given the opportunity to do so in the same order in which theymade their initial statements. Additional procedures for conducting thehearing will be announced at the hearing. Interested persons may present oral or written statements at the hearing.All statements will be made part of the record of the hearing and willbe a matter of public record. Any person who wishes to make an oral statementat the hearing should notify the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,Federal Railroad Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC20590 (telephone (202) 366-0635), before March 31, 1989 stating the amountof time required for the initial statement. FRA proposes to amend Part 218 as set forth below. FRA solicits commentson all aspects of the rule and may make changes to the final rule basedon comments received in response to this proposal. The final rule in thisproceeding will include a revised penalty schedule for Part 218 reflectingthe higher maximum penalties now available and will add entries for thenew sections proposed. See the recent revisions to the penalty provisionand penalty schedule of Part 218 required by the RSIA and published inthe Federal Register on July 28, 1988 (53 FR 28594). Because FRA's penaltyschedules are statement of policy, notice and comment are not requiredon revisions of these schedules (see 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(3)(A)). Nevertheless,interested parties are welcome to submit their views on what penaltiesmay be appropriate.
