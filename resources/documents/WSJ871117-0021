In a case cited by critics as evidence of lapses by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the jury Friday convicted Pymm Thermometer Corp. in Brooklyn, N.Y., of assault and reckless endangerment, among other charges. Also convicted were William Pymm, company president; Edward Pymm Jr., vice president; and an affiliate, Pak Glass Machinery Corp.    But in setting aside the verdicts, a state judge said the case should have been tried in federal court because OSHA and its rules were federally created, according to a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office. &quot;We'll appeal the decision,&quot; she said.    An attorney for Pymm couldn't be reached.    In an indictment handed up in October, the state charged that Pymm operated a machine to crush broken thermometers and recover the mercury in an illegal workroom and that one of its workers suffered permanent brain damage from mercury exposure.    At the time of the indictment, prosecutors faulted OSHA for failing to follow through on alleged safety problems after being told of the Pymm workroom. After New York state officials began investigating the company in February, OSHA cited Pymm for alleged violations of federal safety standards. OSHA officials later acknowledged the Pymm case had been mishandled.    The district attorney's office said Pymm had paid OSHA some fines under the citations and that other fines were pending.    If the judge's ruling is reversed, the executives face five to 15 years in prison, and fines of $5,000, or double the profit made by failing to comply with the rules, a district attorney's office spokeswoman said. The companies could be fined a maximum of $10,000, or double the profit. </TEXT></DOC>
