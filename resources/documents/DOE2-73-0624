In detail it is shown that, with the inclusion of radiant absorptionand emission being decisive effects for long-term climate variations,global evolution criteria can be formulated quite generally and appliedto typical meteorological-climatological conditions. For our specificsystem in which radiant phenomena and Fourier-type heat conduction arecombined, the validity of the Glansdorff-Prigogine general evolutioncondition is discussed. This principle is applied as a basis to derivea sufficient thermodynamical stability criterion for Budyko-Sellers typeenergy balance models. With given simplifications so-called kinetic ordiffusive potentials characterizing Lyapounov-stability can be formulated.This analysis is used to discuss the limiting case of an isothermal gray(and especially a black) body whose entropy production becomes a minimumin stationary states. We notice too, how Paltridge's former hypothesisof a climate having a maximum production of entropy can be interpretedin this thermodynamical connexion.</TEXT></DOC>
