(see Analyst's Note,Page 36).andM;From the outside, color scanners look the same as their monochrome kin, andthey operate in much the same manner.andP;  The difference is the illuminationthat they provide.andP;  Instead of a single ordinary fluorescent tube, most colorscanners use three, one for each of the primary colors of light (red, greenand blue).andP;  Each tube is equipped with one color of phosphor and a filter tofine-tune the hue of its output.andM;During scanning, the three tubes are flashed rapidly in succession while asingle charge-coupled device (CCD) measures the light level reflected fromthe artwork being scanned, one dot at a time.andP;  The CCD measures the intensityof each color separately, discriminating as many as 256 different levels.andO;Alternatively, using just one of its tubes -- typically the green -- a colorscanner can duplicate the work of the best monochrome machines, potentiallyresolving a full 256 gray-scale levels.andM;In testing it took 30 percent less time to do a monochromatic scan than acolor scan.andP;  Because each image must be scanned three times at once in acolor scan, a single color pass through the scanner took four minutes or morefor the sharpest rendering of a full page.andP;  The wait is worthwhile, however,because the output is Polaroid-perfect.andM;Or better.andP;  Color-scanner image-processing programs can improve the originalart by allowing independent manipulation of colors, contrast and brightness.andO;And with built-in gamma correction, clear images can be lifted from murkyoriginals.andM;Judging the best color scanner here is not an issue for a sharp eye.andP;  Thecolor spectra and resolution capabilities of these scanners far exceedcomputer display and output systems -- and even original artwork.andP;  Ordinaryprinted images may use 1,000 to 2,000 distinct tones, hundreds of times fewerthan what these color scanners can distinguish.andP;  Consequently, these machineswill deliver the same results on-screen and on paper.andM;In fact, all three scanners examined offer identical color and resolutioncapabilities.andP;  Which to buy depends more on what needs to be scanned andwhether a turnkey or mix-and-match solution is required.andM;The Sharp JX-450 shines as the best choice for scanning large (up to 11 by 17inches) or transparent originals.andP;  Howtek's Scanmaster II and Sharp's JX-300limit scans to images slightly larger than 8 by 11 inches, but these machinestake up a minimum of desk space.andM;Howtek's Scanmaster II wins when the user needs a comprehensive, easy-to-usesystem.andP;  While Sharp offers no control software for its color scanners,Howtek offers its machine both bare and as a turnkey system, with aninterface and Howtek's own control software.andP;  Buyers will need to pay carefulattention to the control software they choose to use with their scanner,since this software determines the file formats supported.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
