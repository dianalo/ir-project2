 DOS extenders help large DOS programsthat have run out of room, but the industry still needs a better operatingsystem -- OS/2.andP;  In this generation, companies like Lotus and Microsoft arebringing out applications on OS/2 and DOS.andP;  The next round will be OS/2 only,and that is where the future lies.andP;  Word v5.0 and Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3.0 arein DOS and OS/2, but versions beyond that are going to be OS/2 only.andM;DOS extenders are nice, but they don't give a leap forward for applications.andO;Future applications may have a threat running in the background, analyzinghow the user is tackling a problem by using AI techniques and maybesuggesting a better way if relevant.andP;  That is the real power of OS/2.andM;Q But don't you think the current popularity of DOS extender technology willslow down the acceptance of those applications by extending the life of DOS?andM;A yes, OS/2 has been slower to take off than we anticipated two to threeyears ago.andP;  But with the version for the 386 and 486 chips due soon, it willbe a long-lived operating system.andP;  Three hundred and fifty applications areshipping worldwide, aside from corporate internal development.andP;  The big roundof applications will be released in the second half of this year.andP;  Inaddition, all software companies behind OS/2 have said that PresentationManager is central to their strategy.andP;  If we can extend DOS, that will helppeople for a period of time, but the competitiveness of the market for OS/2applications will encourage people to move over.andM;Q Wasn't there a version of DOS 3.5, planned to incroporate DOS extendertechnology?andM;A There may have been, but it never had any status as far as I know.andP;  We havenot announced plans to introduce such a version -- our plan for DOS is tomake it smaller and faster because we believe we have a better solution.andM;Q Bill Gates went on record saying that Microsoft would have the full quotaof applications available for OS/2 in the next four to five months.andP;  Doesthis mean we'll be seeing a lot of announcements in the near future?andM;A Our application strategy is firmly fixed on graphics, and the threeplatforms are Windows, Presentation Manager and the Macintosh.andP;  We plan ourdevelopment around five strategic applications: spreadsheet, (includingcharting), word processing, email, databases, presentation graphics, andintegrated software, represented for us by the Works package.andP;  Our strategyis to put applications in all those categories and on all platforms.andM;In future we'll be using a common core that will be adapted to make all thedifferent versions.andP;  That's a very ambitious plan which will be hard for usto achieve, so we won't have every square on the matrix filled in three tofour months.andM;Q Where does that leave your existing character-based applications?andM;A We'll continue to develop and enhance our character-based products.andP;  Forinstance, there's a new version of Multiplan, 4.0, released in Germanyrecently.andP;  We are making a transition from character to graphical-basedproducts because we believe graphics is better, but harder to develop.andP;  For many users character-based applications provide a solution that they're happywith.andM;Q All your next generation products are rumoured to require highspecification machines, especially if running OS/2, but reports on the betaversion of Word for Windows suggest that will also require a lot of memoryand a fast processor.andP;  Aren't you expecting people to make rather a largeleap in hardware terms?andM;A In five years there may well still be single tasking machines running oneapplication, but the vast majority will want multiple applications that willbe available for OS/2, with email capable of sending text and graphicsrunning in the background.andP;  If people are happy with the existingapplications, we aren't suggesting they change.andM;The PC came out originally with 64K.andP;  Then Lotus and Microsoft came alongwith applications, and soon they were demanding 256K and even 512K.andP;  To domore capable work we'll need more capable machines; you can't go 180mph in avolkswagen.andM;Running graphical applications needs a fair chunk of power, a 286, 386 or 486and plenty of memory.andP;  We are concerned that the price of memory should comedown.andM;Q Is the graphical model, with the need for a high resolution display, themouse and memory really the way forward?andM;A We can attribute the success of the Macintosh exclusively to the graphicalinterface.andP;  If it had just had an A: prompt we wouldn't even remember it, butApple has captured 10 per cent of the world PC market with it.andP;  Graphics hasattracted those users, and now more copies of Windows are being sold permonth than Macintoshes.andM;Q Will the recent decision in the first round of the court case between youand Apple affect the development of Windows and Presentation Manager?andM;A Although the judge made statements that we read in the headlines,indicating perhaps that Apple had gained some advantage, the judgment was aconfirmation of both our positions.andP;  The designs for Windows v1.0 arelicensed, and the real issue is to be decided on the copyright of Windowsv2.0.andP;  Microsoft feels that everything in Windows is appropriate.andM;Q Why do you think Apple brought the lawsuit against Microsoft in the firstplace?andM;A Ask Apple.andP;  We didn't ask them to sue us.andM;Q Excel has achieved a share of the spreadsheet market at a time when Lotuswas failing to deliver on time.andP;  Now that the market leader has its strategysorted out, and version 3.0 is soon to be available, do you think this mightaffect your sales?andM;A We're very satisfied with the market share progress of Excel.andP;  We neverplanned to bankrupt Lotus and it's difficult to change such an establishedstandard like 1-2-3.andP;  We're playing a long-term spreadsheet game.andP;  Manypeople have been waiting to see Release 3.0 and we expect our market share tocontinue increasing.andP;  It is not just the capabilities of Excel, but its easeof learning for newer users, reduced training costs and DDE that make it sellwell.andM;Q Having seen Release 3.0, it recovers most of the ground you had ahead ofthem, and adds other features like 3D sheets that overhaul Excel?andM;A Excel is not standing still.andP;  It's not a flagship product, and comparesfavourably with what's on the market, even in its current version.andP;  We'llleave it to the market to decide.andM;Q NeXT has just signed a deal with Businessland to market their machinecommercially in the US and UK.andP;  DO you regret your decision not to supportthat machine?andM;A Steve Jobs is a very brilliant guy and did a great job when the PC marketwas young and searching for directions.andP;  Now there is a strong commitment tothe 386 and 486 architectures, the latter being superior to the NeXT, Sparcand Motorola 68040 processors in terms of pure chip power.andP;  The NeXT machinehas some interesting features like the optical disk, but there are a numberof unanswered questions.andP;  It's interesting but rather expensive, and we don'texpect it to do much more than find a niche.andM;Q Might it not also be related to your interest in UNIX, with your purchaseof an enlarged stake in SCO?andM;A Microsoft has always been the world's largest seller of UNIX with XENIX.andO;SCO is taking on more development and marketing and strengthened thepartnership we had all along.andM;Q Is it not a threat to OS/2?andM;A UNIX is important in vertical markets and may gain some popularity withhorizontal applications, but there are so many standards and still a lack ofstandard applications that it is hard to conceive of UNIX machines with abroad spectrum of horizontal productivity software applications.andM;Q Do you favour OSF or UNIX International?andM;A We support the need for standardization and have been working with the OSFon PMX, but we haven't made any public announcements on that.andM;Q Will the forthcoming Windows v3.0 have any changes to bring the API back inline Presentation Manager?andM;A No, we are not planning to bring them together, that's technically toodiffficult.andP;  There is more in OS/2 1.1  than Windows, and a bunch ofhistorical reasons for the difference.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
