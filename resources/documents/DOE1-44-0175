<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-0175 </DOCNO><TEXT>In order to optimise well completions and production in naturally fracturedreservoirs and to predict the effectiveness of enhanced oil recoveryschemes, it is important to locate and describe the in-situ fractures.A combination of log measurements and core data were employed to locateand orient the fractures and assess their overall contribution to reservoirperformance in a Devonian reef complex. These techniques include theimaging of the wellbore with the Formation MicroScanner Log (FMS) andthe Borehole Televiewer (BHTV). The image data were compared to detailedcore analysis, where available, and were used to determine the length,orientation and probability of fractures as a function of porosity. TheArray-Sonic tool was also run to help identify fractured zones usingfull waveform data and to quantify producibility from Stoneley wave datain comparison to flowmeter production logs. From the comparison of theimages with core, the utility of the FMA and BHTV Logs were establishedin identifying fractures and fracture sets as well as determining theorientation and vertical extent of the fractures. In addition, the responseof FMS images to different porosity types was confirmed by core data.Comparison of the Array-Sonic data and the flowmeter production log dataestablished the usefulness of the Stoneley wave attenuation as a meansof identifying permeable zones. The study results permit better definitionof tool response to porosity types and fractures, and reveals the influenceof fractures on the overall rpoduction of the reef complex. These resultshave implications on the initial and secondary production techniquesof this and other carbonate reservoirs.</TEXT></DOC>
