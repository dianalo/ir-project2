(Product introduction).andO;Product:   BICC Data Networks ISOLAN EtherConnect System/4 Structured WiringHub (Network hub) (Product introduction).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionLocal Area NetworksNetwork Hubs.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>BICC Data Networks, Inc., a supplier of Ethernet LAN equipment, announced theexpansion of its ISOLAN EtherConnect System for local-area networks.andP;  BICCData Networks demonstrated its full ISOLAN system at NetWorld '90.andM;The ISOLAN EtherConnect System/4, designed for a small office LAN,accommodates up to four line cards (i.e., multi-media repeaters, bridges,multiport transceivers) and can support over 400 users.andP;  It also provides twotypes of network management: local management, without using dedicated PCresources, and remote management.andP;  The ECS/4 is compatible with the existingISOLAN ECS/10.andM;Both the ECS/4 and the ECS/10 incorporate BICC Data Networks' &quot;DistributedRepeater Architecture&quot; (DRA), a fault-tolerance feature that prevents afailure of one repeater line card (RLC) from affecting the entire network.andO;This is achieved because each card contains its own built-in repeater logicdevice, a BICC Data Networks RULA repeater chip, which integrates allrepeater functionality into a single device for maximum reliability.andP;  Onlythose segments attached to the RLC would be impacted by a repeater failure,ensuring that the rest of the network continues normal operation.andM;The ISOLAN EtherConnect Systems offer interoperability based on the 10BASE-Tstandards for unshielded-twisted-pair (UTP) wiring, shielded-twisted-pairwiring, thick and thin coaxial cable, and fiber-optic media.andP;  The systemsprovide built-in support for the IEEE 802.1 standard for network management.andM;The EtherConnect System/4 Enclosure is priced at $1,595 (Line Cards andManagement Card are priced separately).andM;In addition, BICC Data Networks announced new products that supportshielded-twisted-pair (STP) wiring:  the 1201-3 STP System and the new 1182STP Transceiver were added to the ISOLAN EtherConnect System for use in astructured wiring environment.andM;The STP System, including an STP repeater line card, distribution panel, andconnecting cable, enable users to operate on an Ethernet network implementedon IBM Cabling System either in a facility prewired with STP cable, or in anetworking environment where token-ring has been previously used.andP;  Users whoalready have the appropriate connectors and connecting cable may purchase theSTP Repeater Line Card separately.andP;  The STP Transceiver can be used toconnect Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and other network components to an STPEthernet network.andM;The 1201-3 Shielded Twisted Pair System is also priced at $1,595, includingrepeater line card, distribution panel, and connecting cable.andP;  The 1203-1Shielded Twisted Pair Repeater Line Card alone is $1,295.andP;  The 1182 ShieldedTwisted Pair Transceiver is priced at $195.andM;Both a managed bridge line card and a multiport transceiver fine card werealso announced.andP;  The 1205 Managed Bridge Line Card allows interconnection offully configured Ethernet networks, expanding the network both in terms ofusers and geography.andP;  ISOVIEW Network Manager can monitor, configure, andcontrol the 1205 Managed Bridge Line Card from one point on the EtherConnectSystem network.andP;  High-speed filtering and forwarding rates and duplicate pathoperation are made possible by support of Spanning Tree software.andP;  The 1205Managed Bridge Line Card is priced at $4,495.andM;The 1201-4 Multiport Transceiver Line Card, with four AUI connectors,simplifies cabling and connectivity between EtherConnect Systems and otherrack-mounted products (such as bridges and terminal servers) by eliminatingtransceivers and AUI connectors.andP;  The 1201-4 is fully managed under theISOVIEW Network Manager.andP;  The 1201-4 Multiport Transceiver Line Card ispriced at $495.andM;Information:  Charles MacMullen, 508-898-2422.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
