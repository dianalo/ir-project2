But, alas, if a &quot;white backlash . . . to tighten repression,&quot; a South African government &quot;even less responsive to U.S. influence&quot; and blacks &quot;suffering the most as U.S. companies pull out&quot; are signs of success, what would failure look like?    The South African economy, you report, managed to grow 2.5% to 3% this year, up from 1.5% in 1986, despite sanctions. But, we are told in tones of satisfaction, without sanctions the economy would have grown a point faster, &quot;making it more difficult for South Africa to reach the 5% to 6% annual growth rate needed to keep up with population growth and to cut unemployment.&quot; Is that another way for the U.S. to bestow its blessings on black South Africans who need jobs, not just to survive, but to make the system feel their economic power, as they just did in a three-week mine strike? With friends like these, they don't need enemies.    So what is supposed to be paying off? Much is made of the U.S. having sent a clear message that it is &quot;on the side of the downtrodden majority, reinforcing blacks' determination.&quot; Is that meant to suggest a determination to continue an indefinite armed struggle, on the mistaken assumption that the West will come to their aid, and not to negotiate the accommodation that in the end is unavoidable? If so, sanctions are clearly sending the wrong message, one that not only is disastrous for South Africa and the region, but also in terms of U.S. interests.    It is bad enough for a great power to deal in empty gestures, but gestures that are positively harmful are worse. Worst of all is to opt for doing harm in order to prevent &quot;the perception of inaction.&quot; You have given &quot;Washington Insight&quot; a depressing new meaning.    Herman W.
