Introduction</ITAG>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is proposing to amendits regulations governing the implementation of Title II of the PublicUtility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA).\1\<NOTE/> Since issuance of the current regulations, a number of problemshave developed with the interpretation and implementation of these regulations.The instant rulemaking addresses problems with the criteria and proceduresunder section 201 of PURPA by which qualifying small power production andcogeneration facilities, <T3>i.e., </T3>qualifying facilities (QFs), can obtain PURPA benefits.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 16 U.S.C. 796-825r (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Section 210 of PURPA directs the Commission to ``prescribe,and from time to time thereafter revise, such rules as it determines necessaryto encourage cogeneration and small power production * * *.'' In a separaterulemaking in Docket No. RM88-6-000, the Commission recently proposed toclarify its rules on the administrative determination of avoided cost underPURPA. <T3>See</T3> Administrative Determination of Full Avoided Costs, Salesof Power to Qualifying Facilities, and Interconnection Facilities, 53 F.R.9331, IV FERC Statutes and Regulations, Proposed Regulations andpara; 32,457at 32,155 (1988) [hereinafter ADFAC NOPR]. The Commission also proposedrules in Docket No. RM88-5-000 to permit states to set avoided cost ratesthrough bidding mechanisms. <T3>See</T3> Regulations Governing Bidding Programs, 53 F.R. 9324, IV FERCStatutes and Regulations, Proposed Regulations andpara; 32,455 at 32,031(1988) [hereinafter Bidding NOPR].Specifically, the Commission proposes to clarify its rules by amendingPart 292. In so doing, the Commission believes it will satisfy its statutoryobligation to periodically review and revise regulations as necessary toencourage cogeneration and small power production, energy conservation,efficient use of facilities and resources by electric utilities and equitablerates for electric consumers.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>PURPA was one component of Congress' effort to solve what was perceivedas a nationwide energy crisis in 1978, when it enacted omnibus legislationintended to provide for increased conservation of electric energy and increasedefficiency in the use of facilities and resources by electric utilities.In PURPA, Congress recognized the potential of cogeneration\3\<NOTE/> and small power production\4\<NOTE/> to increase the efficiency of generating electric energyand reduce the nation's reliance on imported oil.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Cogeneration is the sequential production of electricalpower and useful thermal energy, such as heat or steam. The sequentialuse of energy can involve either electricity production first, thermalapplication second (``topping-cycle'') or vice versa (``bottoming-cycle'').Because both types of energy (heat and electricity) are produced in a singleprocess, fuel savings in the range of 10-30% are generally possible incogenerated production of electricity and steam as compared to producingthe two separately. <T3>See </T3>Stobaugh and Yergin (editors), <T3>Energy Future </T3>159 (Random House 1979). These fuel efficiencieswere explained in a 1980 General Accounting Office report:<ITAG tagnum="28">Most industrial process steam is produced through direct combustionof fossil fuels. Direct combustion of results in available heat reachingtemperatures as high as 3,600 degrees F. Most industrial processes, however,require steam at much lower temperatures, less than 400 degrees F. Thus,burning fuels to produce only low-temperature process steam is an inefficientuse of energy. Substantial fuel savings can be achieved if the high-temperatureenergy available from combustion is first used to generate power, and thenreject heat, ranging from 200 to 1,000 degrees F, depending on the typesof fuel and systems involved, is used for industrial process heat applications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Comptroller General, ``Industrial Cogeneration_What It Is, How ItWorks, Its Potential,'' at 11 (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1980).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Small power production facilities use biomass, waste,renewable resources (including wind, solar, and water) geothermal energy,or any combination thereof to produce electric power. Reliance on thesesources of energy can reduce the demand for traditional fuels.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>Report of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resourceson S. 2114 (the Senate version of PURPA), No. 95-442, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.2 (1977).Prior to the enactment of PURPA, a cogeneration or small power productionfacility seeking to establish interconnected operation with a utility facedthree major obstacles. First, a utility was not generally willing to purchasethe electric output or was not willing to pay a fair rate for that output.Second, some utilities charged discriminatorily high rates for back-upservice to cogeneration and small power production facilities. Third, QFsthat provided electricity to a utility's grid risked being considered apublic utility and subject to extensive state and Federal regulation.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>123 Cong. Rec. 23848 (daily ed. Aug. 1, 1977) (remarksof Sen. Percy); <T3>id. </T3>at 32403, (Oct. 5, 1977) (remarks of Sen. Durkin); <T3>id. </T3>at 32437, (remarks of Sen. Haskell); <T3>Id. </T3>32419 (remarks of Sen. Hart).In recognition of these impediments, Congress enacted Title II of PURPAto foster the development of cogeneration and small power production.Section 210 also directs the Commission to exempt qualifying cogenerationfacilities and certain small power production facilities, in whole or inpart, from the Federal Power Act (FPA),\7\<NOTE/> the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA),\8\<NOTE/> and state laws and regulations regarding the financial ororganizational regulation of electric utilities, if the Commission determinessuch exemption is necessary to encourage cogeneration and small power production.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 16 U.S.C. 792 <T3>et seq. </T3>(1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 15 U.S.C. 79 <T3>et seq. </T3>(1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 16 U.S.C. 824a-3(c) (1982). Qualifying cogeneration facilities,qualifying small power production facilities not exceeding 30 megawattspower production capacity are exempt. 16 U.S.C. 824a-3(e) (1982). Subsequentlegislation exempted geothermal and solar powered small power producersup to 80 megawatts from FPA and PUHCA oversight. Energy Security Act, Pub.L. 96-294, section 643(b); Energy and Water Development AppropriationsAct of 1988, Pub. L. 100-202, section 310.Congress took this action because it believed that the burdens of traditionalutility-type regulation were likely to discourage cogeneration and smallpower production.\1\\0\<NOTE/> Thus, Congress concluded that exempting these facilitiesfrom traditional utility-type regulation would be an effective stimulusto QF development.\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ <T3>See </T3>Executive Office of the President, The National Energy Plan(G.P.O. 1977) at 45. <T3>See also The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Cogeneration: Its Benefitsto New England </T3>(Oct. 1978).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ Resource Planning Associates, Inc., <T3>The Potential for Cogeneration Development in Six Major Industriesby 1985 </T3>(1977).Section 3(17) of the FPA, as amended by PURPA, defines a qualifying smallpower production facility as an entity which ``produces electric energysolely by the use, as a primary energy source, or biomass, waste, renewableresources, geothermal energy, or any combination thereof,'' \12\<NOTE/> with a power production capacity which, together with anyother facilities located at the same site, is not greater than 80 megawatts.\13\<NOTE/> A small power producer must use a specified ``primary energysource'' for all electric generation, except as required for emergency,maintenance, control and related purposes.\14\<NOTE/> Persons ``not primarily engaged in the generation or saleof electric power (other than electric power solely from cogeneration facilitiesor small power production facilities)'' may obtain qualifying small powerproduction facility status if they meet such eligibility requirements asthe Commission may prescribe by rule.\15\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 292.204.

The United StatesCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the Commissionwith respect to fuel use, holding that the statute did not require theCommission to establish separate fuel use criteria and that the Commission'sregulations ``were a reasoned, adequate response to the charge Congressgave it.'' American Electric Power Service Corp. v. FERC, 675 F.2d 1226,1241 (DC Cir. 1982).With respect to technical standards, Order No. 70 set forth permitted levelsof fossil fuel use by qualifying small power production facilities forsuch purposes as ignition, startup, testing, flame stabilization, and control,and for operation during unanticipated outages of the primary energy source.For qualifying cogeneration facilities, Order No. 70 set forth efficiencystandards for certain new facilities using oil or gas and adopted operatingstandards for all topping-cycle cogeneration facilities in order to assurethat a qualifying cogenerator is a <T3>bona fide </T3>cogenerator that procudes a minimum quantity of thermalenergy as well as electricity.\20\<NOTE/> Order No. 70 established further definitions and proceduresto determine QF status, described more fully in each section below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ 45 FR 17960, FERC Statutes and Regulations, RegulationsPreambles 1977-1981 andpara;30,134 at 30933.Pursuant to andSection; 292.205(d) of the Commission's regulations, the Commissionmay waive the operating and efficiency standards ``upon a showing thatthe facility will produce significant energy savings.'' \21\<NOTE/> Order No. 70 also set forth criteria for the ownership ofQFs so as to limit ownership of qualifying QFs to entities not primarilyengaged in the generation or sale of electric power.\22\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ 18 CFR 292.205(d) (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ 45 FR 17970, FERC Statutes and Regulations, RegulationsPreambles 1977-1981 andpara;30,134 at 30,953.

Moreover, the Commission solicitscomments on any procedural or technical modifications to the rules thatmay have been overlooked. By proposing these clarifying changes the Commissionis satisfying its continuing obligation to review its policies and rulesthat encourage cogeneration and small power production, energy conservation,efficient use of facilities and resources by electric utilities and equitablerates for electric consumers, and thereby fulfill its statutory responsibilitiesunder PURPA.\23\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ 16 U.S.C. 2601 <T3>et. seq. </T3>(1982).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Proposed Procedural Modifications</ITAG>A. Public Reporting BurdenPublic reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 8 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. A single responsemay be a notice of qualifying status. As discussed <T3>infra, </T3>under the Paperwork Reduction Act, section IX, the informationcollection burden is estimated to be substanitally shorter under the self-qualificationmethod than under the application certification procedure. The eight hoursindicated above is a weighted average reflecting the projected number ofboth types of those filings as well as the length of time to complete aparticular filing. Send comments regarding this burden estimate, or anyother aspect of this collection of information; including suggestions forreducing this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 (Attention: Kenneth Thomasat (202) 357-5253) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.B. Commission Certification Versus Self-Qualification<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background</ITAG>The original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) that the Commission issuedto implement sections 201 and 210 of PURPA \2\\4\<NOTE/> required that any person seeking qualifying status for afacility: Initiate discussions with the utility with which it wished tointerconnect; and file an application with the Commission. This was intendedto resolve potential problems between the applicant and affected electricutility early in the development of a QF, as well as ensure that an applicantconsider the suitability of its facility for interconnected operation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ Docket No. RM79-54, 44 FR 38822, FERC Statutes andRegulations, Proposed Regulations 1977-1981, andpara; 32,024 (1981).Most of the comments received on this proposed regulation favored eliminatingthe filing requirement either for all qualifying facilities or for specificclasses of facilities. These commenters argued that the complexity, delays,and uncertainties caused by case-by-case certification would act as a significanteconomic disincentive to owners of small facilities. One utility \2\\5\<NOTE/> proposed having regulations on an ``exception'' basis wherethe utility, state regulatory authority, or other interested party couldobject to the granting of qualifying status.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ Pacific Gas and Electric Co.In the final rule,\2\\6\<NOTE/> the Commission eliminated the requirement that all personsseeking status as a QF must file an application with the Commission. TheCommission stated:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ Order No. 70, 45 FR 17971, FERC Statutes and Regulations,Regulations preambles 1977-81 andpara; 30,134 and 30,954.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission believes the initiation of purchase and sale arrangements* * * will necessitate the flow of information between potential qualifyingfacilities and affected electric utilities. The Commission therefore notesthat the requirements contained in the proposed rule both for discussionsbetween a potential qualifying facility and the utility with which it wishesto interconnect and for the filing of substantial information with theCommission are not necessary.\2\\7\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ 45 FR 17962, FERC Statutes and Regulations, RegulationsPreambles 1977-81 andpara; 30,134 at 30,938.The final rule provides that any small power producer or cogenerator whichmeets the critiera for qualification set forth in andSection; 292.203 ofthe Commission's rules is considered a qualifying facility. Facilitiesmeeting these requirements need only provide notice to the Commission oftheir status in order to be eligible for PURPA benefits. This is commonlyreferred to as self-qualification.Under the statute, Commission certification of a facility's eligibilityfor PURPA benefits is unnecessary. However, the Commission did providefor an alternative approach under which developers with novel technologiesor approaches could seek certification of their status by the Commission.This provision of the rules was viewed as a means of resolving disputes.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Problem </ITAG>Currently, in order to have qualifying status a facility must either followa self-qualification procedure or apply for and obtain Commission certification.Although notices of self-qualification have comprised approximately 50percent of applications received, it is unclear why self-qualificationhas not been utilized to an even greater degree. Apparently, the biggestobstacle is the reluctance of financial institutions to back projects withoutthe Commission's ``seal-of-approval.'' For example, one applicant specificallystated that the lenders to the project required Commission certificationas a QF as a condition to the project's financing.\28\<NOTE/> To the extent such ``forced'' filings delay bringing eligiblefacilities into service and therefore increase the cost of facilities enteringinto production, the development of cogeneration and small power productionis discouraged, contrary to the intent of Congress.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ Ecogen One Partners Ltd., Docket No. QF87-615-001 (1988).Although the Commission cannot force financial institutions to back self-qualifiedprojects, we can address the likely cause of their reluctance to do so.This reluctance may be the result of uncertainty over eligibility for PURPAbenefits. If so, the clarifications suggested in this proposed rule, aswell as the development of standardized applications for Commission certification,should alleviate the problems.Such clarifications may not address, however, all of the problems thatmake financial institutions reluctant to finance self-qualified projects.Apparently, some electric utilities and state regulatory agencies use Commissioncertification as a prerequisite for dealing with electric utilities.\29\<NOTE/> Such a requirement may be designed to distinguish <T3>bona fide</T3> QFs in order to assure that the benefits of cogenerationand small power production are actually realized when purchases are made.However, such a requirement is contrary to the Commission's rules. TheCommission reemphasizes utilities' obligation to offer to interconnectwith, purchase from, and sell to self-qualified facilities. Commissioncertification is not necessary to qualify facilities for these PURPA benefits;self-qualification is sufficient.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>application by McKee Products, Inc. in Docket No. QF86-902-001,43 FERC andpara; 61,534 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposed Solution</ITAG>The Commission recognizes the concerns implicit in distinguishing <T3>bona fide</T3> QFs from power producing facilities not entitled tothe benefits of PURPA. In an effort to address these issues and to lendmore credence to the self-qualification option, the Commission proposesthat instead of a self-qualification notice, a QF file an affidavit, withthe Commission, signed by the facility's owner, operator, or authorizedrepresentatives which provides a basic description of the facility as requiredby the exiting rules and a statement that the facility meets the Commission'scriteria. The advantage of such a statement is that, since it is a legallybinding document, it provides greater assurances of a facility's qualifyingstatus than the minimal filing now required.Where it is clear that a facility meets the Commission's criteria, thereis little risk to attesting to its eligibility for PURPA benefits. If QFdevelopers do not have the expertise to determine whether they meet therequisite criteria to supply an affidavit, they could employ industry ``experts''to do so. The Commission has tentatively concluded that an affidavit wouldprovide utilities and state regulatory authorities adequate assurance thata facility is not being misrepresented, and that it does provide the inherentbenefits associated with cogeneration or small power production. As such,the demand for Commission certification should be lessened.The Commission also proposes that a self-qualifying facility provide thesame affidavit to the utility it expects to deal with. The Commission proposesthat the utility be afforded 90 days after receipt of the affidavit tofile objections with the Commission regarding such qualification. Absentfiling such an objection the utility would be obligated to deal with suchfacilities pursuant to our rules without insisting upon Commission certification.The Commission does not wish to encourage needless paperwork or expendtime and resources unnecessarily; therefore, the Commission solicits commentson ways to discourage the filing of frivolous objections.The Commission also solicits comments on what information should be includedin the affidavit, both to satisfy the Commission's need for informationand to facilitate utilities' ability to determine whether to object. TheCommission also invites comments on what procedural steps might be appropriateafter an objection is filed. Assuming that the Commission retains the certificationprocedure, one option for resolving objections could be a limited certificationreview process.The Commission also solicits comment on the continued need for the opportunityto obtain Commission certification. Our review of QF applications for certificationsuggests that in many such applications, eligibility for qualifying statusis easily ascertained. These facilities should use the self-qualificationoption and not the Commission certification option. If the Commission certificationoption were eliminated, facilities employing those novel technologies applicationsand ownership arrangements for which Commission certification was originallydesigned could apply for a declaratory order under the Commission's rules.\30\<NOTE/> The benefits of a separate procedure appear negligible, andthe option of self-qualification may never be fully successful as longas the opportunity for Commission certification remains. The Commission,therefore, solicits comments on the possibility of eliminating the procedurefor Commission certification. In the event the Commission concludes thatthe option of Commission certification is no longer necessary, and eliminatesthe possibility for such certification, the sections of the rules concerningthe certification process for which revisions are being proposed may beomitted from the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ 18 CFR 385.207(a)(2) (1987).c. Qualifying Facility CertificationApplication Filing Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background</ITAG>Of the 3,998 QF filings made from the beginning of the QF program throughDecember 31, 1987, 2,011 have been applications for certification by theCommission. Although approximately 50 percent of these have been filedin complete form and have been processed routinely, incomplete filingshave created problems. Deficient filings result in staff requests for supplementaldata, which delay the ultimate decision on the application. Deficient filingshave not been entirely the fault of the applicants, but may also resultfrom modifications to the information required for certification due tocase precedent as the QF program has evolved.Information submitted in a certification application is presently specifiedin the regulations in broad terms and subsequent case law has necessitatedadditional information to be filed. In practice, precise measures havebeen developed to aid in using these broad guidelines. Moreover, the Commissionhas confronted a variety of situations not explicitly anticipated whenthe original rules were issued. Novel combinations of technologies, energysources, heat uses and business arrangements have occurred that have requiredthe Commission to interpret the proper application of its rules in actingon individual certification filings. Thus, applicants must often examinenot only the basic language of the regulations but also the history ofrelated cases in order to file a complete application. This can be burdensomefor applicants, who may not have ready access to Commission resources.For some applicants, a filing for QF certification may be the initial andonly time they deal with this Commission.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Proposed Solution</ITAG>In the event the Commission continues to use the certification option,the Commission proposes to explicitly outline its information requirementsby incorporating two standardized application forms in our regulations.Specifically, the Commission proposes to delete andSection;292.207(b)(3)and (b)(4) from the current rules and replace them by adding andSection;292.207(b)(2)(i),which would contain the form for applicants requesting certification ofa facility as a small power production facility, and andSection;292.207(b)(2)(ii),which would contain the form for applicants requesting certification ofa facility as a cogeneration facility. Applicants would use such formsfor all applications for certification. By incorporating the specific informationrequired by the rules, the Commission seeks to make it easier for the publicto apply for certification, to reduce the number of deficiency lettersfrom staff, and to eliminate unnecessary delays in processing certificationapplications. The Commission solicits comments on the adequacy of the datarequest in the proposed forms. The Commission notes that any form wouldrequire some degree of flexibility since the uniqueness of individual facilitiesand novel applications will occasionally require supplemental data submissions.\31\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\For example, in McKee Products, Inc., 43 FERC andpara;61,534(1988), the Commission considered whether kinetic energy produced as theresult of moving rocks down conveyor belts constitutes waste.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. General Contents of Applications For Commission Certification</ITAG>All applicants, whether small power producers or cogenerators, must filea common set of infomation. The Commission proposes to continue requiringidentifying information such as the name and address of the applicant andthe location of the facility. The Commission proposes to require additionalinformation in order to accelerate routine processing and evaluation ofapplications. The telephone number of a person with direct knowledge ofthe application should be provided. Either the owner or operator may bethe applicant. Also, the location of the facility should include the state,county, town and street address if known.Electric utility interests in QFs present the Commission with special informationneeds.\32\<NOTE/> Information is required with respect to the identity of theowner of the facility and the percentage of equity ownership by any electricutility or electric utility holding company. The Commission proposes torequire that the applicant provide a statement as to whether or not anelectric utility, electric utility holding company, or any combinationthereof, has or will an ownership interest in the facility, and to requirecopies of relevant agreements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\<T3>See</T3> Ultrapower 3, 27 FERC andpara;61,094 (1984).The Commission further proposes the following data requirement: Descriptionof the facility; identification of the principal components (such as boilers,prime movers, and electric generators); and a narrative sufficient to identifyany characteristics of the facility that the applicant believes may bearupon its qualification status.The Commission also proposes that the energy source to be used by the facilitybe identified in terms of: wastes; renewables, such as water, solar andwind; geothermal resources; fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or naturalgas; and biomass. A description of the energy source is also required (<T3>e.g.</T3> if biomass, the applicant should describe its form, suchas landfill gas, municipal solid waste, wood waste from logging, etc.).The Commission requires sufficient information to verify that the smallpower producer's capacity is below the 30 megawatt threshold for exemptionfrom FPA rate regulation and 80 megawatt threshold for qualifying smallpower production status. This requires an indication as to the power productioncapacity of the facility as defined in new andSection; 292.202(s).For the definition of power production capacity, the Commission will usethe standard set forth in <T3>Occidental Geothermal Inc.,</T3>\33\<NOTE/> where the Commission stated that the power production capacityof a facility is the maximum net output of the facility, as measured atthe busbar, which can be safety and reliably achieved under the most favorableoperating conditions likely to occur over a period of several years.\34\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\17 FERC andpara;61,231 (1981).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\<T3>See</T3> discussion in Power Production Capacity, <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">4. Application Requirements for Small Power Production Facilities</ITAG>The Commission proposes to modify application requirements for small powerproduction facilities. For purposes of verifying the eligibility of a smallpower production facility for qualifying status, the applicant should indicatenot only whether the facility is within one mile of other small power productionfacilities owned by the applicant and uses the same energy source, butalso the identity and individual power production capacities of such facilities.\3\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ <T3>See </T3>Windfarms, Ltd., 13 FERC andpara; 61,017 (1980).In addition to the annual energy input of any natural gas, oil or coal,the Commission proposes to require the percentage of total energy inputto the facility for each. The Commission also proposes that small power producer applicants demonstratethat any wastes that are both primary energy sources and not included inthe proposed list of wastes meet the Commission's proposed ``no currentcommercial value'' test.\3\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ <T3>See </T3>discussion in Waste, <T3>infra. See </T3>Kenvil Energy Corp., 23 FERC andpara; 61,139 (1983);Electrodyne Research Corp., 32 FERC andpara; 61,102 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Application Requirements for Cogeneration Facilities</ITAG>The Commission proposes certain changes to the application requirementsfor cogeneration facilities. Currently, the Commission's regulations simplyrequire a description of the cogeneration system as to whether it is atopping- or bottoming-cycle facility, the date installation of the facilitybegan, and ``sufficient'' information to determine compliance with ``anyapplicable requirements under andSection; 292.205.'' No other specifics areprovided. Consequently, many cogeneration certification filings provideinadequate information for approval.The review of cogeneration certification applications primarily focuseson whether the facility conforms to the requirement for sequential useof energy, and the operating and efficiency standards. Therefore, it isessential for applicants to provide a cycle diagram that depicts the facility'ssequential use of energy, and which allows verification of the other technicaldata. Quantitative information must be submitted regarding the energy flowspertinent to evaluation of the facility's compliance with the operatingand efficiency standards.To determine compliance with the operating standard, the Commission mustbe able to validate the data used by the applicant in its calculation ofthe standard.\3\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission must also be able to validate the data usedby the applicant in its calculation of the facility's compliance with theefficiency standard. In view of this, the Commission proposes to requirethat an applicant submit a legible cycle diagram. The cycle diagram shoulddepict the physical arrangement of the system components and show systemenergy flows and conditions (<T3>i.e., </T3>fuel flow inputs, working fluid flow rates, temperature,pressure and enthalpy at inputs and outputs of prime movers and at deliveryto useful thermal energy applications). A demonstration of compliance withthe efficiency standard for topping-cycle oil and gas cogeneration facilitieswith less then 50 percent use of these fuels will no longer be required.\3\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ The 5 percent operating standard requires a comparisonof the facility's useful thermal output (made available for use in an externalcommercial or industrial process, or used in a heating or cooling application)to the total energy output (the sum of the useful thermal and power outputs).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ <T3>See </T3>discussion in Efficiency Standard Calculations, <T3>infra.</T3>The Commission also proposes that data be submitted that indicate separatelythe annual energy input from each energy source (such as natural gas, coal,or oil) in terms of quantity consumed and Btu content. Btu content determinationsusing the standard industry Lower Heating Value for gas and oil will remain,unchanged. Where appropriate, separate data pertaining to gas or oil usedfor supplementary firing would be required.The Commission proposes to modify its requirements for energy output information,as well as its requirements for energy input information. Data pertainingto the annual useful power output (net electrical output and net mechanicaloutput, if applicable) and annual useful thermal energy output (topping-cycles)will be required. More specifically, the useful thermal energy output informationshould address any heating, cooling or process uses for external industrialor commercial purposes, and should include a description of each such process.Additional information is required for verification of the useful thermaloutput. For heating or cooling uses, the applicant would be asked to identifythe aggregate annual use, factoring hourly and seasonal variations intothe calculation of the annual total. For process uses of thermal energy,the applicant would be asked to identify the output available for use (<T3>i.e., </T3>actually delivered to process) and also provide the enthalpy(Btu/lb), pressure (psia), average flow rate (lbs/hr) and temperature (deg-F)of working fluids that deliver the thermal output to process, and of anyreturn from process.For purposes of demonstrating conformance with the operating and efficiencystandards, the annual aggregate thermal energy input and output due toany supplementary firing must be provided in terms of Btu content.D. Administration of The 90-Day Certification Period And Rejection Of ApplicationsFor NoncomplianceAn application for Commission certification of qualifying status is filedwith the Secretary's Office pursuant to andSection; 292.207 of the Commission'sregulations. Section 292.207(b)(5) provides that an order granting or denyingthe application, setting the matter for hearing or ``tolling'' the timefor issuance of an order will be issued within 90 days of the filing ofa complete application. There appears to be some confusion on the partof many applicants as to when this 90-day frame starts.The Commission proposes to clarify that the 90-day time period for Commissionaction does not begin until all the information needed to complete theapplication has been submitted. In approximately 50 percent of all applications,the information supplied by an applicant is insufficient to verify thata project meets the Commission's QF requirements. In such cases, a determinationof qualifying status is not possible and additional information is requestedfrom the applicant. The 90-day period does not commence running until acomplete application is received_<T3>e.g., </T3>until the receipt of all information filed in response todeficiency letters.E. Effect of OF Project Modification on Qualifying Status Section 292.207(d)(2) of the Commission's rules implementing PURPA providesthat a previously certified qualifying facility may petition the Commissionfor a ruling on whether a prospective change to the facility would affectits qualifying status.\3\\9\<NOTE/> Currently, no distinction is made between petitions underthis rule and an original application for qualifying status certificationunder andSection; 292.207(b). Payment of a substantial filing fee has beenrequired \4\\0\<NOTE/> and lengthy review by Commission staff, including publicationof a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, has unnecessarily delayed action for many simpleproject modifications.\4\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ Section 292.207(d)(2) states that:<ITAG tagnum="28">(2) Prior to undertaking any substantial alteration or modificationof a qualifying facility which has been certified under this section, asmall power producer or cogenerator may apply to the Commission for a determinationthat the proposed alteration or modification will not result in a revocationof qualifying status.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ In a separate rulemaking (RM87-26-000), filing feesfor Commission certification as a QF were recently increased to $4,310for cogenerators and $6,560 for small power producers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ Currently an order usually takes at least 30 days fromthe publication of the notice of the change in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> since interested parties are usually given thatlong to intervene.  Assuming that the Commission retains its certification process, the Commissionis reevaluating the need to subject all ``recertification'' filings tothe same degree of scrutiny as the initial application for certificationof qualifying status. The current approach to QF project modification appearsunnecessary and overly burdensome. In many cases, proposed changes to aqualifying facility are minor in nature and clearly would not affect afacility's qualifying status. Of course, such changes could and shouldbe handled through self-qualification. But in the event Commission certificationis sought, such changes should be approved (or ``certified'') in an expeditedmanner. In most cases, the ``difficult'' questions (such as does the facilityapply its thermal output to a ``useful'' purpose) have already been answeredin the original certification. Thus, the effort required to evaluate thesechanges typically will be substantially less than that required for theoriginal certification and does not warrant charging petitioners the andSection;292.207(b) filing fee or subjecting the petition to protracted review. Streamlining the review of andSection; 292.207(d)(2) petitions should reduceadministrative burdens for both the Commission and QFs. Consequently, theCommission proposes to allow QFs undertaking certain changes to their facilitiesto maintain their qualifying status by simply notifying the Commissionof the particular change. To facilitate this process, the Commission wouldinclude a list of such modifications for convenient reference. Notificationwould take the form of a letter to the Commission describing the changein sufficient detail that the Commission can readily determine that itwould not affect a facility's status. For changes identified below theCommission would return a copy of the letter to the applicant stamped ``approved.''It is possible, however, that certain modifications would substantiallyalter the basic characteristics of the facility and therefore would entaila more detailed and thorough review. For example, significant decreasein efficiency or in the operating standard calculations (particularly whena facility's previous eligibility was borderline) or changes in the technicaldesign of a facility can affect a facility's qualifying status. Petitionsfor such major modifications are more appropriately treated as an originalfiling for certification of qualifying status. Therefore, should continuedCommission certification be sought, fundamental changes in the design oroperation of a facility would need to be reviewed under andSection; 292.207(b).If a proposed change could not be stamped ``approved,'' it would be treatedas a section 207(b) filing with the required fee assessed. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Examples of Changes That Would Not Affect QF Status </ITAG>For purposes of the above proposal, the following is a nonexhaustive listof changes to a QF that would clearly not affect its qualifying status.This means that it is readily evident from a review of a letter describingthe change that the qualifying status of the facility would not be affected.Initially, the Commission proposes the following list of changes: andbullet; A change in the name of the corporation or partnership owningthe QF. andbullet; A change in the ownership of a small power production facilityif the new and remaining owners are unaffiliated with an electric utility,electric utility holding company or combination thereof.  andbullet; A change in the ownership of a cogeneration facility if (1) thenew and remaining owners are unaffiliated with an electric utility, electricutility holding company or a combination thereof, and (2) the user of thethermal energy produced by the cogenerator is unaffiliated with the cogenerator. andbullet; A change in the location of a proposed qualifying small powerproduction facility if the new location is not within one mile of any othersmall power production facility and is owned by the same parties and usesthe same primary energy source.  andbullet; A decrease in the amount of natural gas or oil used by a cogenerationfacility if the efficiency and operating standard calculations for thefacility remain at or above the minimum limits for those standards.   andbullet; A decrease in the amount of fossil fuel used by a small powerproduction if the total use of fossil fuel remains below the limit forthe fuel use. andbullet; A change in the primary energy source of a small power productionfacility if the new energy source is biomass, renewable resources, geothermalresources, one of the waste energy sources in our proposed list, or anycombination thereof. andbullet; A change in the energy source of a cogeneration facility if thenew primary energy source does not result in an increase in the facility'suse of natural gas or oil.andbullet; An additional use of a cogeneration facility's themal output ifthe original uses are maintained as specified in the original certificationorder. andbullet; An increase in the efficiency or operating standard calculationof a cogeneration facility. andbullet; A change in the power production capacity of a small power productionfacility, if the facility capacity does not exceed the capacity limit establishedfor that particular type of facility. andbullet; A change in the power production capacity of a cogeneration facilityif the efficiency and operating standard calculations for the facilityremain at or above the minimum limits for those standards.The Commission requests comment on the appropriateness of these changesand any additional changes to QFs that could be included.<ITAG tagnum="85">IV.

Discussion of Issues </ITAG>a. <T3>Introduction</T3>_As the above discussion of Commission orders indicates,the current regulations and policy on electric utility ownership of QFsrequire the Commission to engage in an examination of the stream of benefitsand management organization of QF projects on a case-by-case basis. Theseexaminations often involve determinations about appropriate discount rates,what is or is not a benefit, whether a particular preferred stock is equityor debt, and who can exercise control over the business venture. The processmay become more difficult to administer should analyses become more complex.However, a codification of our existing precedent could help eliminatesuch administrative difficulties. Aside from administrative inefficiencies, the Commission's current 50 percentownership restriction may not be the best means for achieving the policyobjectives of PURPA. The present rule may be too lenient in some circumstances,and too strict in others. Limiting utility equity participation to 50 percentmay unnecessarily restrict the advantages of utility participation wherethe potential for abuse of monopoly power through self-dealing by an electricutility is low, yet may offer incomplete protection where the potentialfor abuse is high. On the other hand, the Commission's ownership rule hasworked reasonably well. The rule has proven sufficiently flexible to allowutilities to participate in QF projects and, at the same time, appearsto offer adequate protection against abuses due to self-dealing in manycircumstances. b. <T3>Concerns Regarding Utility Ownership of OFs_</T3>(1) <T3>Self-dealing. </T3>The legislative history of PURPA does not fullyexplain the rationale behind the limitation on utility ownership of QFs.The legisaltive record is clear that none of the drafters wanted to discourageutility ownership of cogeneration. However, one of Congress' concerns wasto protect against the potential abuse of monopoly power that might resultif electric utilities were exempted from traditional utility regulation.\71\<NOTE/> One means of abusing monopoly power is self-dealing_thata utility may favor its own subsidiary over others. However, the meansby which such favoritism may be expressed range from the simple to theexceedingly complex. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ Early versions of PURPA required that utilities be giventhe right of first refusal to construct and operate cogeneration facilitiesbefore a cogenerator could itself build such a facility. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>the Cogeneration and Waste Heat Utilization Act (H.R.6661 and S. 1363); the Electric Utility Act of 1977 (H.R. 6660). Thesebills also extended tax credits to utilities investing in congeneration.However, when President Carter proposed the National Energy Act, the ownershipof qualifying cogeneration projects was limited to those ``to primarilyengaged in the generation or sale of electric energy.'' <T3>See </T3>section 522(b) of H.R. 6831 and S. 1469, the National EnergyAct. In testimony before the House and Senate on the issue of utility ownership,the Federal Power Commission (FPC) agreed that the FPA must be amendedto make cogeneration more lucrative for utilities, but expressed concern,however, about relaxing price regulation for utilities by virtue of theirownership of congeneration since utilities have monopoly power. The FPCcommented that both utilities have monopoly power. The FPC commented thatboth utilites and industrials should be allowed to own cogeneration facilitiesbut only industrials should be assumed to be competitive enough to be freedfrom price regulation. Response to the Federal Power Commission in Appendix,<T3>Responses to Subcommittee's Request for Answers to Questions on PublicUtilities, </T3>in Part 3, Vol. II, National Energy Act, <T3>Hearings Before The Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committeeon Interstate and Foreign Commerce, </T3>95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) at1743-46. Also, witnesses expressed concern that mandatory ownership ofcogeneration by utilities would deprive industrials of their independencefrom utilities and thereby discourage industrial development of cogeneration.<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Testimony of Mr. Gerald L. Decker in Part 3, Vol. II,National Energy Act, <T3>Hearings Before The Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committeeon Interstate and Foreign Commerce, </T3>95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) at338. <ITAG tagnum="28">The bill initially passed by the House, H.R. 8444, contained tax incentivesfor utilities owning cogeneration facilities, gave utilities the rightof first refusal to construct and operate cogeneration plants, and didnot contain the Carter Administration's ownership limitation with regardto exempted QFs. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>section 546(b) of H.R. 8444, the National Energy Act (introducedby Rep. Ashley). 123 Cong. Rec. 27,244 (Aug. 5, 1977). In contrast, whilethe Senate bill, S. 2114, was also designed to encourage utility ownershipof cogeneration, it did contain the Administration's limitation of utilityownership of exempted cogeneration. <T3>See </T3>section 12(c) of S. 2114, the Public Utilities RegulatoryPolicy Act of 1977 (<T3>reported </T3>by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resoruces). 123Cong. Rec. 32,696 (Oct. 6, 1977). With regard to this provision, SenatorJohnston explained that the exemption from FPA and PUHCA regulation appliesonly to persons not primarily engaged in generating and selling electricpower. 123 Cong. Rec. 32391 (Oct. 5, 1977). The Conference Report adoptedthe Senate's position with no explanation. However, in explaining the owenrshiprestriction, the Conference Report stated that ``[t]he test of this [ownership]case is whether the entity which owns the facility is primarily engagedin the generation or sale of electric power other than in connection withits ownership of the cogeneration facilities or small power productionfacilities.'' H.R. No. 95-1750, Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act,95th Cong., 2d Sess. 89 (1978). Abuses due to self-dealing might arise under a variety of circumstances.A utility might offer a higher price for QF power from its subsidiariesthan from nonaffiliated QFs. Alternatively, the price may be no higher,but other contract terms may be more favorable. Self-dealing concerns mayalso arise in the duration of contract negotiations. Potential for abuse due to self-dealing may also arise apart from contractnegotiations. For states that set avoided cost administratively, a utilitysubsidiary could be placed ``first in line'' to avoid the next incrementof capacity. Subsequent QFs would receive lower (or no) capacity paymentssince the utility's capacity needs would already have been satisfied. Insuch a case, the utility, by purchasing first from its own subsidiary,might indeed skew the payments in favor of its own interests. The potential for abuse of monopoly power through self-dealing also extendsto circumstances beyond the construction of the QF. For example, a utilitymight be more lenient in enforcing performance standards upon its subsidiarythan upon its nonaffiliated QFs. Or, if QF contracts call for dispatchablepower, a utility might self-deal by dispatching its own facilites preferentially.The above forms of self-dealing could be very difficult to identify sincethere are legitimate reasons for a utility to treat different suppliersunequally. For example, the utility subsidiary might propose a technicallysuperior project. Whether an electric utility concluded contract negotiationswith its QF subsidiary more quickly than with others because of favoritism,or simply because the subsidiary proposed a better project, presents verydifficult questions. Regulators could face an extremely complicated taskin unraveling the utility's motives and might never be able to identifyabuses due to self-dealing from the reasonable exercise of management discretion.Another potential self-dealing problem is the utility's manipulation ofthe avoided cost when it receives substantial power affiliated QFs. Forexample, the utility could sign contracts with affiliated QFs that callfor the avoided energy cost to be computed on an ``as delivered'' basis.At some future time, the utility could experience an outage of its coal-firedbaseload unit and instead rely on more expensive oil or gas-fired sources.The utility would not incur a financial penalty for this. Rather, the coal-firedunit would remain in rate base, and the higher fuel costs would be passedthrough to ratepayers in the fuel adjustment clause charge. The avoidedenergy cost would also rise, resulting in greater profits to the QF subsidiary.(2) Cross-subsidization.Another concern with utility ownership of QFs is ratepayer subsidizationof the electric utility's QF activities. This concern is not unique toelectric utility participation in QFs. Indeed, this same concern aroseduring Commission consideration of the proposed regulations regarding independentpower producers (IPPs).\7\\2\<NOTE/> When a company subject to cost-plus regulation diversifiesinto an unregulated competitive venture, an incentive develops to passcosts from the unregulated activity on to captive customers of the regulatedactivity. It is particularly difficult to protect against such behaviorwhen the unregulated activity is in the same field as the regulated one(as in the case of electric utility ownership of QFs).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\2\ Regulations Governing Independent Power Producers,Docket No. RM88-4-000, 53 FR 9327, IV FERC Statutes and Regulations, ProposedRegulations andpara; 32,456 at 32,114 (1988) [hereinafter IPPs NOPR] (proposingrelaxed FPA pricing regulation and streamlined FPA corporate regulationfor a class of nontraditional power suppliers that the Commission can categoricallyconclude lack significant market power).The problem of cross-subsidization is not new, however, and the opportunityto misallocate costs arises only to the extent that regulators are unableto separate nonregulated activity costs from native load-related costs.State regulatory agencies have had to deal with these issues many timesin the past, and have developed techniques which, although imperfect, allocatecosts between regulated and unregulated ventures. Some states require thatunregulated activities be placed in separate subsidiaries to simplify accountingdemands. Others may forbid diversification altogether.The Commission tentatively concluded in the IPPs NOPR \7\\3\<NOTE/> that this problem may be best dealt with by the states, sincethey have had the most experience with it and because it relates more directlyto retail rates. Recent experience suggests that it would be difficultfor franchised electric utilities to cross-subsidize.\7\\4\<NOTE/> Generally, franchised electric utilities now face more aggressivestate regulators who have experience with policing utility involvementin diversified activities and potential abuses due to cross-subsidies andcost misallocations. Cross-subsidization may also be difficult becauseindustrial consumers, in particular, have considerable ability to varytheir demands for electrical energy in response to price increases.\7\\5\<NOTE/> The phenomenal growth of self-service through cogenerationunder PURPA, the increasing demands of industrial customers to ``shop''for their electrical needs and the ``rate discounts'' franchised electricutilities are offering their industrial customers to delay cogenerationall attest to the price-sensitivity of industrial customers. In short,misallocations and cross-subsidization may subject the utility to significantregulatory and business risks.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\3\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\4\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\5\ The demand-side substitution of energy inputs is discussedgenerally by James L. Sweeney, <T3>The Response of Energy Demand to Higher Prices: What Have We Learned?</T3>74 Am. Econ. Rev. (Proceedings) 31-37 (1984).c. <T3>Advantages of Greater Electric Utility Participation in QFs. </T3>Counterbalancingthe concerns with utility participation in QFs are two principal advantages:The utilities' expertise and their access to capital. Many utilities haveengineering staff whose experience and expertise could be put to work designingand constructing efficient QFs. Additionally, many utilities have a substantialflow of internally generated funds available for diversification into otherbusinesses. There may be distinct efficiency gains to be achieved by allowinga utility's particular expertise to be brought to bear in an area not toofar afield from its core business.There are already very competent companies involved in the financing, construction,and operation of QFs. But maximizing the number of participants in theQF market, including utilities, cannot but have positive effects on achievingfurther efficiencies_to the benefit of consumers.\7\\6\<NOTE/> The existing ownership regulations may impede electric utilityparticipation in QFs even when there is no risk of self-dealing. Allowingfor greater participation of electric utilties when the risks of such increasedparticipation are low would encourage the development of efficient QFsconsistent with the goals of PURPA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\6\ The Commission tentatively concluded in Docket No.RM88-5-000, that purchases from QFs fall within the meaning of ``anothersource'' under the PURPA section 210(d) definition of ``incremental costof alternative energy.'' Thus, any reduction in QF costs due to competitionresulting from increased number of potential QFs will not only benefitsociety as a whole, but will also be translated into lower avoided costsand savings to consumers. Bidding NOPR andpara; 32,455 at 32,027.Furthermore, permitting greater electric utility participation in QFs couldalso benefit consumers by permitting QFs to become active in power projectsthat would not qualify as QFs under PURPA. Investors in non-QF power plantsare, by definition, electric utilities. QFs, therefore, can only make aminimal investment in non-QF power projects without simultaneously becomingelectric utilities and thus subjecting themselves to the Commission's currentownership restriction. As long as electric utility participation in QFsis restricted, QFs cannot participate in non-QF power projects withoutjeopardizing their QF status.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Potential Reforms of Ownership Restriction</ITAG>Although the Commission recognizes that certain problems have been raisedconcerning the Commission's current ownership rules, we do not believethat we have an adequate basis at this time to conclude that any changeis warranted. The existing rule appears to represent a reasonable compromisebetween all of the interests involved in the QF industry. However, becausequestions have been raised as to whether our regulation is fully achievingthe purposes of PURPA, the Commission seeks comment on a number of matters.Where there is little possibility of abuse due to direct self-dealing,the current 50 percent restriction may unnecessarily inhibit electric utilityinvolvement. Where the possibility of abuse of monopoly through self-dealingcannot be ruled out, the present 50 percent equity limitation on utilityownership may not offer complete protection.The Commission solicits comment on the need to circumscribe direct utilityparticipation in QF projects by a means other than focusing on utilities'equity position. One approach could be to focus on utilities' control ofsuch projects.\7\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission also desires commentary on whether the regulationof utility participation in QFs should parallel the Commission's proposedregulation of IPPs.\7\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\7\ The issue of control has been considered in a numberof other contexts which might offer guidance in developing standards forwhat would constitute control in the instant situation. For example, underthe Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.A. 688, which provides a cause of action for seamenwho are injured in the course of their employment, seamen have a causeof action if they can show effective control by U.S. interests over foreignships. Effective control has been defined through a non-exhaustive listof factors, such as the allegiance of the defendant shipowner. Under theFinancial Accounting Standards Board accounting standards, the usual conditionfor control is ownership of a majority (over 50%) of the outstanding stockalthough the power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage ofownership, e.g., by contract or lease. Under the Federal Trade Commission'sPremerger Rule andSection; 801.1(b), in the case of an entity that has nooutstanding voting securities control means having the right to 50 percentor more of the profits of an entity, or having the right in the event ofdissolution to 50 percent or more of the assets of the entity, or regardlessof its form of organization, having the contractual power presently todesignate 50 percent or more of its directors or individuals exercisingsimilar functions.<ITAG tagnum="28">In contrast to numerical tests, in Order No. 497 (Docket No. RM87-5-000)the Commission adopted a definition of control for identifying affiliateswhich emphasizes the authority to direct or cause the direction of themanagement or policies of a business entity rather than a percentage ofownership or voting rights; a 10 percent voting interest creates a rebuttablepresumption of control. Similarly, andSection; 240.12b-2 of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission's regulations defines control as directly or indirectlypossessing the power to direct or cause the direction of the managementand policies of a person through ownership of voting securities, contractor otherwise. 15 CFR 240.12b-2 (1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\8\ Under the Commission's proposed definition of IPPs,a subsidiary of a franchised utility could not sell to the parent subsidiaryand qualify for IPP treatment for that transaction. A franchised utilityor subsidiary of the franchised utility could only qualify as an IPP fornonaffiliate sales of power. IPPs NOPR at 32,112.By imposing similar restrictions on utility ownership of QFs and IPPs,it may be possible to avoid the Commission's regulations biasing franchisedutilities' investment choices in QFs and IPPs. Absent reform of the currentQF ownership regulations, dissimilar treatment of IPPs may create incentivesfor electric utilities to ``game the system.'' If electric utilities werenot allowed to own IPPs selling to affiliates but were allowed to own upto 50 percent of a QF doing so, to the extent the utility wants to makesales to affiliates an incentive would exist to create QFs by adding contrivedthermal loads to facilities that would otherwise be IPPs or regulated utilityplants. On the other hand, to the extent the utility does not want to engagein affiliate transactions it may avoid OFs and concentrate on IPP projects.It will do this because it can own 100 percent of IPPs, but is limitedto 50 percent ownership in QFs. Thus, absent alteration, the Commission'sexisting ownership restriction may actually discourage the developmentof QF projects.  Parallel regulatory treatment would eliminate the possibilityof the Commission's ownership restriction's biasing utilities' choicesbetween IPP and QF projects.Accordingly, the Commission solicits comments on three potential changesto the regulations regarding electric utility ownership of QFs. The firstpotential reform on which the Commission seeks comment is a bar againstaffiliate sales. Congress left it to the Commission to prescribe, by rule,regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of PURPA. As such, theCommission has broad authority to take action necessary to ensure thatelectric utility ownership of QFs would not undermine the purposes andobjectives of PURPA. The abuse of monopoly power through self-dealing maybe serving to discourage the development of nonaffiliated QFs. Such actionmay also undermine the independence of industrial cogenerators. Accordingly,the Commission seeks comment on whether the potential for abuse due toself-dealing is a matter that requires Commission action.A key concern regarding potential abuses due to self-dealing is that thefranchised electric utility can financially benefit by purchasing fromits affiliate. Should Commission action be warranted, to successfully protectagainst potential abuses due to self-dealing the definition of an ``affiliate''may have to be structured to eliminate the potential for financial gaindue to self-dealing. This suggests that, to fully succeed, franchised electricutilities may need to be prohibited from purchasing from QF projects inwhich they own more than a <T3>de minimis</T3> share of the project. Rather than wrestle with howto define ``<T3>de minimis</T3>'' on a case-by-case basis, the Commission could simplybar any transaction where the purchasing utility has <T3>any</T3> financial interest.\7\\9\<NOTE/> This bar would be administratively easy to apply, and shouldnot limit the flow of electric utility capital into QF projects.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\9\ It should be noted that such a bar would be prospectiveonly.A restriction on affiliate sales, however, may not need to be imposed withoutexception. Not all arrangements between electric utility-owned QFs andaffiliates necessarily raise self-dealing issues. For example, an EastCoast utility that owns several West Coast QFs might find it desirableto have its QFs sell to an affiliate and then have this affiliate act asa broker of the QFs' power. Alternatively, if wheeling can be arranged,the utility could use power from one QF to provide power to other QFs.Since the franchised affiliate would not be involved in the transactionin any way, other than through its ownership of the QFs, self-dealing isnot a concern. Also, potential abuses due to self-dealing are unlikelyto be a major problem when the electric utility is procuring QF power ina competitive bidding program.Consequently, restrictions on affiliate sales may not be necessary undera variety of circumstances. It might be possible to accommodate such circumstancesby establishing a waiver of any affiliate sale restriction whenever thereis limited or no potential for abuse due to self-dealing. One possibilitythat pershaps should be explored would be to have any prohibition againstaffiliate sales operate as a blanket restriction, subject to waiver bystate regulatory authorities on a case-by-case basis. The state regulatoryauthorities could review the specific facts of each case for potentialself-dealing, and have the authority to grant a waiver where supportedby the facts. Alternatively, the waiver could be granted by the Commissionupon petition by the QF and affiliated utility and possibly in conjunctionwith the relevant state regulatory Commission. The Commission invites commentson the possibility of waiving the bar against affiliate sales, how sucha waiver should be implemented procedurally, and how it ought to be appliedwith respect to nonregulated utilities. The Commission also solicits commenton alternative approaches other than a case-by-case waiver that would permitaffiliate sales when there is little potential for abuse due to self-dealing.The second change would be the elimination of the ``upstream'' attributionof ownership provided the previous change barring affiliate sales is adopted.Elimination of such attribution would permit utility subsidiaries to own100 percent of QF projects. The Commission solicits comment on whethersuch a change would be appropriate provided that the rulemaking recordsupports the conclusion that such ownership would foster the purposes ofPURPA, and provided that such ownership does not run afoul of the concernsabout exempting from FPA regulation those persons that have monopoly power.Electric utility ownership of QFs through subsidiaries may encourage activeelectric utility participation in QFs while at the same time ensuring thatelectric utilities' activities in which they have monoply power remainsubject to FPA and PUHCA regulation. Also, eliminating the ``upstream''test and permitting electric utility subsidiaries to own 100 percent ofQFs would support allowing QFs to own 100 percent of non QF power projectswithout losing their QF status. They could accomplish this result by eithersetting up subsidiaries through which to invest in IPPs, or reorganizingso that QFs become a subsidiary of a parent corporation that participatesin IPP projects.Finally, the Commission seeks comment on the advisability of adopting arevenue test for defining when a company is ``primarily engaged'' in thesale of non-QF electric power. Under PURPA, a qualifying facility mustbe ``owned by a person not primarily engaged in the generation or saleof electric power (other than electric power solely from cogeneration andsmall power production facilities).'' \80\<NOTE/> Under a ``revenue test,'' persons whose business is not primarilythat of electric utilities, but who may sell some power that is not froma qualifying facility, would be permitted to own QFs. A person could beengaged in both QF and non-QF power transactions and not be deemed ``primarilyengaged,'' provided that power transactions did not constitute that person'sprimary business.\81\<NOTE/> The Commission solicits comment on the value of adoptinga revenue test, and if so, how such a test should be structured.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ 16 U.S.C. 796(17)(C) and (18)(B) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ So long as power sales are not the primary business,a company can engage in a variety of business ventures without losing itsQF status. For example, Company A derives 50 percent of its income frommanufacturing widgets, 20 percent from sales of QF power, and 30 percentfrom sales of IPP power. In this instance, Company A would still have aqualifying facility since power sales in general (and IPP power sales inparticular) would not consititute its primary business.The Commission recognizes that any revisions in the ownership criteriashould be made effective prospectively. Barring affiliate sales, for example,a new ownership test, if applied to existing projects, could disturb avery large number of contracts. Also, permitting utility subsidiaries toown 100 percent of QFs in combination with an affiliate sales restrictioncould result in a major reorganization of the electric utility industry'sparticipation in QF projects. Therefore, the Commission solicits commentson whether the Commission, if it were to change its ownership rules, shouldnot only grandfather existing projects and contracts, but also providefor a transition period before any new restrictions would become effective.Calendar YearThe Commission's rules require all QFs to meet the operating and efficiencystandards on a calendar year basis. Small power production facilities usingfossil fuels must meet a similar requirement with respect to the proportionof fossil fuel use. Under a strict interpretation of the ``calendar year''language, QFs must meet the Commission's standards, on average, betweenthe period of January 1 to December 31 of every year. This interpretationof the calendar year language is clearly overrestrictive and does not reflectthe Commission's original intent.The Commission proposes to clarify its intent by establishing a 12 consecutivemonth average as the period of applicability for a QF's first year of operation.Under this proposal, QF facilities would be required to meet the Commission'stechnical standards on an annual basis beginning on the in-service dateof the facility. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to replace the phrase``during any calendar year'' in andSection;andSection; 292.204(b)(2), 292.205(a)(1),and 292,205(a)(2) with ``on an annual basis beginning with the inservicedate of the QF.''<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Proposed Technical Modifications for Cogeneration Facilities</ITAG>A. Efficiency and Operating StandardsCogeneration facilities can realize significant fuel savings through thesequential use of energy to produce two forms of useful output, namelyelectric power and heat, as opposed to the separate production of electricpower and heat. To assure that the efficiency inherent in the joint productionof power and thermal energy would be realized, the Commission establishedan ``operating standard'' for topping-cycle cogeneration facilities.\8\\2\<NOTE/> The Commission's standard requires that ``[f]or any topping-cyclecogeneration facility, the useful thermal energy output of the facilitymust, during any calendar year period, be no less than 5 percent of thetotal energy output.'' \8\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\2\ A topping-cycle cogeneration facility means a cogenerationfacility in which the energy input to the system is first used to produceuseful power output, and the reject heat from power production is thenused to provide useful thermal energy (18 CFR 292.202(d)). In bottoming-cyclecogeneration facilities the sequence of the two processes is reversed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\3\ 18 CFR 292.205(a)(1) (1987).The 5 percent thermal output requirement was the result of a balancingof competing interests. It does not preclude any available technology nordoes it bias the choice of fuels. However, the operating standard by itselfdoes not assure the most efficient use of energy.\8\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\4\ For example, calculations show that for a steam turbinecogeneration facility, a 5 percent operating standard improves fuel useefficiency by less than 1 percent_fuel use being measured as the differencein energy requirements of the cogeneration facility and the quantity ofenergy that would be required if the electric generation and thermal usefunctions were satisfied separately. A 20 percent operating standard onlyincreases energy savings to 4.2 percent.In the original rulemaking, therefore, the Commission sought to assurethe efficient use of scarce fuels by imposing an efficiency standard ontopping-cycle cogeneration facilities using oil or natural gas. Both energysources were considered to have high strategic value and were subject topervasive use and price regulation. Strategic concerns have led to extensiveefforts to conserve oil and natural gas. These include: The Energy Supplyand Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 (ESECA),\8\\5\<NOTE/> which proposed to deal with the Nation's energy shortagesfollowing the oil embargo ``by providing for coal conversion,'' among otherthings; and the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA),\8\\6\<NOTE/> which prohibited, except to such extent as may be authorizedunder Title II, Subtitle B of the FUA,\8\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\5\ Pub.

The standard requires that, fortopping-cycle cogeneration facilities (that began on or after March 13,1980) for which any of the energy input is oil or natural gas, the usefulpower output plus one-half of the useful thermal energy output during anycalendar year must be no less than 45 percent of the total energy inputof natural gas and oil to the facility when the operating standard calculationis less than 15 percent.\8\\8\<NOTE/> This standard is relaxed to 42.5 percent when the operatingstandard calculation is more than 15 percent.\8\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\8\ 18 CFR 292.205(a)(2)(B) (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\9\ 18 CFR 292.205(a)(2)(A) (1987). Operating and efficiencystandards are not feasible for bottoming-cycle cogeneration facilitiesand, therefore, no standards for such facilities are in place except wheresupplementary firing is involved.No efficiency standard is applied to facilities using other fuels. Themajor alternative to gas and oil is coal. An abundant domestic supply ofcoal, free from price and use regulations,\9\\0\<NOTE/> made this unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\0\ ``Project Independence'' (1974) found that increaseduse of the country's abundant indigenous coal reserves could provide along-term solution to the nation's apparent growing shortage of naturalgas and ever-increasing reliance on imported oil.Sine the Commission's efficiency standards were promulgated, the nation'snatural gas supply picture has improved dramatically and world oil priceshave stabilized. So much so, that Congress amended the FUA and the NaturalGas Policy Act (NGPA). The FUA amendments relaxed or repealed many of therestrictions on the use of natural gas and petroleum fuels in new powerplants, major fuel-burning installations, and other facilities. Specifically,the amendments allow gas or oil use by certain baseload facilities \9\\1\<NOTE/> provided that they certify that they are not precluded frombeing coal-capable. Those facilities precluded from being coal-capablemust seek an exemption from the Department of Energy. The amendment (Pub.L. 100-42) also removed the incremental pricing requirements under TitleII of the NGPA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\1\ A baseload unit is one that generates greater than3,500 hours per year. U.S. Department of Energy certification of futurecoal capability is required for cogenerators using more than 100 millionBtus/hour of natural gas or oil and selling more than 50 percent of theirelectrical output. Otherwise, no certification is required to use naturalgas or oil.Now that government control of the uses and prices of natural gas havelargely been removed, questions have arisen as to the continued usefulnessof the efficiency standard. Given deregulation of oil and natural gas prices,the efficient use of fuel is ultimiately determined by economic considerations,as reflected in the market price of natural gas and oil. Oil and gas pricesnow reflect their relative scarcity or abundance. As such, it may be arguedthat choices among alternative fuels should be based on long-term expectationsof their price and availability. Prices will encourage the appropriateuse and conservation of these fuels.The Commission raised the issue of the continued appropriateness of itsoperating and efficiency standards in its regional conferences.\9\\2\<NOTE/> The opinions of the various segments of the electric utilityindustry differ on the need for and magnitude of the operating and efficiencystandards. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\2\ Commission's Conference on PURPA, Docket No. RM87-12-000,52 FR 2552, FERC Statutes and Regulations andpara; 35,011 (1987). Regulated electric utilities essentially agreed that both standards shouldbe increased, but there is a lack of unanimity as to the appropriate levelof the increases. Increasing the standards, the utilities argue, would(1) eliminate the ``PURPA machines''; (2) bring electric generation andthermal output into a more satisfactory balance; and (3) better fulfillthe societal objectives of conserving energy in general, and natural gasand oil in particular. The operating standard most frequently recommendedby electric utilities is 25 percent.\9\\3\<NOTE/> Utilities argue that this is the minimum standard that isneeded to attain all the above objectives: it would discourage questionablethermal energy schemes; it would provide for a more satisfactory balancebetween thermal use and electric power generation; and it would increasefuel use efficiency. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\3\ <T3>See </T3>Comments of Utah Power and Light Co., Florida Power Corporation,Oklahoma Gas and Electric Co., Southwestern Electric Power Co., and MiddleSouth Utilities, Inc. Most regulated electric utilities assert that the current efficiency standardis not very meaningful. The bulk of the oil and gas used by cogenerationfacilities is for consumption in combined-cycle units. Modern technologyhas progressed to a point where normal operation of a combined-cycle facilitywould readily result in attainment of a 45 percent efficiency standard.\9\\4\<NOTE/> Thus, utilities argue, as a minimum, the efficiency standardshould be raised to 50 percent. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\4\ The Technical Assessment Guide, EPRI P-4463-SR, December,1986, lists a heat rate (at higher heat value) of 8150 Btu/kWh for a conventional220-megawatt combined-cycle unit operating at full load and using distillatefuel oil or gas fuel. That yields an efficiency (at lower heat value asused in the Commission's regulations) of 46.32 percent when the fuel isnatural gas and 44.69 percent when the fuel is a light distillate oil.The nonregulated electric utilities that commented on issues relating to``PURPA machines'' and the need to change the operating and efficiencystandards generally seem to agree with their regulated counterparts.\9\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\5\ <T3>See </T3>Comments of Alabama Electric Cooperative, Inc. (recommendedthat the Commission act to discourage ``PURPA machines''); National RuralElectric Cooperative Assoc. (NRECA) (supported proposal that current thermalefficiency standard for cogenerators be increased); Colorado-Ute ElectricAssoc. (suggested that overall efficiency of a QF should at least meetor exceed the efficiency of a comparable electric utility and that theoperating standard be increased to 25%). Cogenerators almost unanimously disagree with this position. Most smallpower producers concur with the cogenerators that the Commission's currentstandards for qualification either are adequate or should be reduced. Severalreasons are given for this position. First, with the FUA amendments arguably there is no longer any need forefficiency standards.\9\\6\<NOTE/> Second, for most cogenerators, particularly the large ones,the need to find additional thermal load to meet the requirements of anincreased operating standard may create a hardship, or lead to the creationof questionable thermal loads. Third, to the extent that thermal loadsare fixed, an increase in the operating standard will reduce the capacityof the generating component and, therefore, the overall efficiency of thecogenerator.\9\\7\<NOTE/> Fourth, from an energy conservation standpoint, even relativelyinefficient cogeneration is more efficient than simple production of electricpower.\9\\8\<NOTE/> Fifth, higher efficiency standards reduce the operationalflexibility of the facility and make dispatching more difficult.\9\\9\<NOTE/> Since most utilities want dispatchable QFs, this would greatlydiscourage cogeneration. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\6\ <T3>See</T3> Comments of Signal Energy Systems. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\7\ <T3>See</T3> Comments of Cogen Technologies, Inc. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\8\ <T3>See</T3> Comments of ANR Venture Management Co. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\9\ <T3>See</T3> Testimony of Albert Smith, Chairman and President, PSE Inc.at Tr. 243-244, Commission's Conference on PURPA, Washington, DC, April16, 1987. The Commission has several options regarding its operating and efficiencystandards. The standards could be increased to levels that would assuresubstantial increases in the energy efficiency of individual cogenerationfacilities. Alternatively, the Commission could eliminate the standardsaltogether, or leave the standards unchanged. Increasing the existing standards would undoubtedly discourage some potentialcogenerators that are in all other respects consistent with the Congressionalintent for the PURPA program. Eliminating the standards would make cogeneratorsfor all practical purposes indistinguishable from other powerplants. The Commission proposes to leave the operating and efficiency standardsunchanged as long as <T3>bona fide </T3>cogenerators enjoy the special privileges bestowed byPURPA. The Commission believes that a simple means of identifying <T3>bona fide </T3>cogeneration facilities remains appropriate. The currentminimum operating standard, that 5 percent of the facility's total energyoutput be in the form of useful thermal energy output, meets such a test.Elsewhere in this NOPR, the Commission is proposing more detailed economictests which should discourage token uses of thermal output for QFs. Furthermore,with the encouragement of entrepreneurial investment in non-QF power projectsas an alternative to cogeneration, there may be less incentive to employ``creative'' use of thermal output. Maintenance of the operating standardwill also assure some degree of energy efficiency and fuel conservation.The Commission also believes that the efficiency standard should remainat its current level for cogenerators using oil and natural gas. Althoughthis standard does not assure that cogeneration facilities be made as efficientas possible, it does require that cogeneration facilities be no less efficientthan state-of-the-art combined-cycle generating plants. With the amendmentsto the FUA, utilities may now construct combined-cycle baseload plants.Cogenerators would be held to a standard no more and no less strict. Finally, the Commission observes that where the purchasing utility's avoidedcosts are accurately set, the market will dictate the proper balance thermaland electric output.\1\\0\\0\<NOTE/> Maintenance of both standards at current levels would offerprotection against wasteful use of fuel if avoided costs, as set throughadministrative methods, are determined inaccurately. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\0\ The Commission has proposed, in a separate rulemaking(Docket No. RM88-5-000), to waive the efficiency standard for oil- andgas-fired cogeneration facilities that compete in a bidding program forcapacity payments and are selected as winning bidders. This waiver wouldnot apply to the operating standard under andSection; 292.205(a). <T3>See </T3>Bidding NOPR at 32,030. B. Efficiency Standard Calculations<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background</ITAG>Under andSection;292.205(a)(2), the efficiency standard for new topping-cyclecogeneration facilities is applied to <T3>``any </T3>topping-cycle cogeneration facility for which <T3>any</T3> of the energy input is natural gas or oil''.\1\\0\\1\<NOTE/> Both facilities that use oil or natural gas as the primaryenergy source and those using other primary energy sources in combinationwith some oil or gas must meet the Commission's efficiency standard.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\1\ 18 CFR andSection;292.205(a)(2) (emphasis added).The efficiency standard applies only to facilities, the installation ofwhich began on or after the date the rules were issued, March 13, 1980.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Problem</ITAG>Some cogeneration facilities are primarily fired by energy sources otherthan oil or natural gas and use only small amounts of these fuels, forpurposes such as ignition, start-up, flame stabilization, and control.The application of the Commission's efficiency standard to these facilitieshas been a source of some confusion.The Commission's efficiency standard was designed to assure that topping-cyclecogeneration facilities fired by oil or natural gas use these fuels moreefficiently than any combination of facilities separately producing electricityand steam.\1\\0\\2\<NOTE/> As such, the efficiency standard is intended to be directedtoward facilities primarily fired by these fuels and was not intended fortopping-cycle cogeneration facilities not primarily fired by oil or gas.These facilities easily exceed the Commission's standard by wide margins.\1\\0\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\2\ 45 FR, note 56 at 17967.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\3\ The reason for this is that the standard comparesthe overall output of a facility only to the natural gas or oil input.Thus, facilities using small amounts of oil or natural gas for purposesof flame stabilization, start-up, or control easily exceed the Commission'sstandard.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposed Solution</ITAG>The Commission believes that topping-cycle cogenerators using oil or naturalgas in amounts less than or equal to 50 percent of the annual energy inputshould not be required to document compliance with the Commission's efficiencystandard. The Commission proposes to exempt topping-cycle cogenerationfacilities using only some natural gas or oil from providing computationsas evidence that they meet the Commission's efficiency standard. Thus,only topping-cycle cogeneration facilities that derive more than 50 percentof their annual energy input from oil or natural gas would be requiredto document that they meet the Commission's efficiency standard. The Commissionbelieves this proposal will further streamline the review of certificationapplications.C. Sequential Use of EnergyIn adopting its regulations for qualifying status of cogeneration facilities,the Commission added the requirement of sequential use of energy to thestatutory definition of a cogeneration facility.\104\<NOTE/> In so doing, the Commission explained that sequential usemeans that:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\104\ Section 201 of PURPA added section 3(18)(A) of the FPAwhich defines a cogeneration facility as a facility which produces (i)electric energy, and (ii) steam or forms of useful energy (such as heat)which are used for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes.16 U.S.C. 796(18)(A) (1982). The Commission's regulations define a cogenerationfacility as ``equipment used to produce electric energy and forms of usefulthermal energy (such as heat or steam) used for industrial, commercial,heating, or cooling purposes, through the sequential use of energy.'' 18CFR 292.202(c) (1987).<ITAG tagnum="20">rejected heat from a power production or heating process is used inanother power production or heating process. It is precisely this ``cascading''use of energy in sequential processes that gives rise to the energy conservingcharacteristic of cogeneration.\105\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\105\ Order No. 70, 45 F.R. 17959, 17960-61, FERC Statutesand Regulations, Regulations Preambles 1977-81 andpara; 30,134 at 30,934-35.<T3>See also </T3>EGandamp;E, Inc., 16 FERC andpara; 61,060 at 61,104 (1981).There are two type sof sequential uses of energy. In a ``topping-cycle''cogeneration facility, the energy input to the facility is first used toproduce power, and the reject heat from power production is then used toprovide useful heat.\106\<NOTE/> In a ``bottoming-cycle'' cogeneration facility, the energyinput to the system is first applied to a useful heating process, and theresidual heat emerging from the process is then used for power production.\107\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\106\ 18 CFR 292.202(d) (1987). In a topping-cycle facility,not all of the working fluid (typically steam) which passes through theprime mover (typically a turbine) to produce electricity must be appliedto a useful thermal output. The sequential use rule requires, for example,only that the portion of turbine steam flow used for a thermal purposebe previously used for generation. <T3>See </T3>Texas Industries, Inc., 29 FERC andpara; 61,051 at 61,111 (1984);Adolph Coors Co., 34 FERC andpara; 61,209 at 61,355 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\107\ 18 CFR 292.202(e) (1987).In applying these criteria, the Commission may determine that only partof a cogeneration facility meets the sequential use requirement. Accordingly,it may certify the qualifying status of that portion of the facility thatmeets the sequential use requirements while denying certification to thenonsequential use portion of the same facility.\108\<NOTE/> In some combined-cycle cogeneration configurations, applicantsappear to have designed their projects so that a token amount of steamfrom the condensing steam turbine can be extracted to establish sequentialuse.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\108\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>California Portland Cement Co., 20 FERC andpara; 61,217(1982).The Commission is proposing a revision to its current regulations in orderto eliminate potential confusion about the sequential use requirement andto eliminate the incentive to propose token uses of steam which do notimprove the cogeneration facility's efficiency. The Commission notes that,although the sequential use requirement is discussed in the preamble toOrder No. 70,\109\<NOTE/> the term is not explicitly defined in the regulations. However,the sequential use requirement is implied in our definitions of topping-and bottoming-cycle cogeneration facilities.\110\<NOTE/> The Commission is also concerned that the current use requirement,as it has been applied on a case-by-case basis, may have resulted in inconsistentapplication of the requirement and a bias toward certain technologies overothers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\109\ <T3>See </T3>45 F.R. 17960-62, FERC Statutes and Regulations, RegulationsPreambles 1977-1981 andpara; 30,134 at 30,934-37.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\110\ 18 CFR 292.202(d) and (e).The Commission reaffirms the general definition that sequential use ofenergy means either that rejected heat from power production is used toprovide useful thermal energy, or that rejected heat from a thermal processis used for power production, so that, in either case, energy flows fromone activity to the other. However, we are proposing to modify the definitionof at topping-cycle cogeneration facility to allow that only some of thereject heat from power production must be used for a useful purpose independentof power production_an industrial thermal process or a heating application,for example. The definition will then be consistent with Commission casepractice.\111\<NOTE/> In order for a topping-cycle cogeneration facility to qualifyfor the PURPA benefits, energy delivered to a useful thermal process orheating application must have first been routed through some portion ofthe power production process. Similarly, the Commission proposes to makea parallel change in the definition of bottoming-cycle facilities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\111\ <T3>See </T3>Texas Industries, Inc., 29 FERC andpara; 61,051 and County ofOlmsted, Minnesota, 31 FERC andpara; 61,066.There are many possible arrangements of equipment that would satisfy therule outlined above. It is important to note that thermal energy wouldnot have to be extracted from every turbine. The rule requires only thatthermal energy be extracted somewhere along a chain of turbines linkedby a sequential energy flow. A condensing turbine may be part of a qualifyingcogeneration facility, provided that useful thermal energy is extractedfrom an ``upsteam'' turbine. In this example, the upstream turbine providessteam both to a thermal process and to a lower pressure, downstream turbine.By contrast, an example that would not meet our proposed definition ofsequential use of energy is a situation where a condensing unit takes steamdirectly from fuel-fired boilers, uses it to generate power, then condensesit, with none of the steam being used for any thermal energy application.\112\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\112\ <T3>See </T3>Adolph Coors Co., 34 FERC andpara; 61,209 at 61,355 (1986).A combined-cycle facility would meet the proposed sequential use test ina number of ways. Useful thermal energy could be extracted in the formof steam from the steam turbine. Alternatively, the thermal energy couldbe taken directly from the heat recovery boiler, since this energy wouldalready have passed through a power producing process in the gas turbine.Of course, a combined-cycle power plant without any heat recovery wouldnot qualify as a cogeneration facility. D. Useful Thermal Energy Output Under section 201 of PURPA, a qualifying cogeneration facility must producesteam or forms of useful energy (thermal energy output) which are usedfor industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes.\113\<NOTE/> The existence of a <T3>bona fide </T3>useful thermal energy output is what distinguishes a<T3>dual </T3>product cogenerating facility from a single product generatingfacility. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\113\ 16 U.S.C. 796(18)(A) (1982). In order to be considered ``useful,'' a thermal output must have an ``independentbusiness purpose'' with some economic justification.\114\<NOTE/> The rationale for this test rests on the premise that opportunitiesfor improved energy efficiency with cogeneration arise from the productionof dual products, electricity and useful heat, from a single energy source.Therefore, the absence of a genuine purpose for a heat product negatesthe potential to gain improved efficiency from cogeneration. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\114\ <T3>See </T3>EGandamp;E, Inc. 16 FERC andpara; 61,060 at 61,104 (1981) (``theuse of thermal energy must be completely independent of the power productionprocess''); John W. Savage, 28 FERC andpara; 61,233 (1984) (applicant providedpersuasive evidence of the independent economic attractiveness of his aquacultureventure). The Commission's application of the independent business purpose test hasevolved along two areas of concern. One such area of concern is the determinationthat a cogeneration facility must have two <T3>separate </T3>products.\115\<NOTE/> The objective in such cases is to determine that the proposed``useful thermal product'' is truly separate and not just one of the processingsteps in the production of electricity. As the Commission stated in <T3>Electrodyne:</T3> \116\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\115\ 16 FERC at 61,104. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\116\ Electrodyne Research Corp., 32 FERC andpara; 61,102 at61,279 (1986). (Footnote omitted). <ITAG tagnum="21">[U]seful thermal energy output must truly be an output. Thermal applicationssuch as power plant feedwater heating, deaerating and fuel preparationare internal to the power production cycle and are, therefore, not outputs* * * [T]he application must be used for a process in which thermal energyeffects a chemical or physical change. The production of electricity ormechanical energy, a steam driven pump for instance, is not a thermal output.</ITAG>The second area of concern has focused on the validity of the businesspurpose underlying the thermal application. Whereas industrial and commercialprocesses with established steam or heat requirements and standard thermaluses for heating and cooling buildings have been considered acceptablewithout any additional evidence of business purpose, new or unusual applicationsof thermal energy have had to be supported by evidence that the thermaloutput is to be used in an economically justified activity and is not contrivedto satisfy the Commission's operating standard to obtain QF status.\117\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\117\ <T3>See </T3>EGandamp;E, Inc., 16 FERC at 61,104; John W. Savage, 28 FERCandpara; 61,273 (1984); James A. Drake and Miller's Plant Farm_Foliage andChrysanthemum Division of Dustin, Oklahoma, Inc., 28 FERC andpara; 61,241(1984); <T3>Electrodyne, </T3>32 FERC at 61,279; Fayette Manufacturing Corp., 36FERC andpara; 61,230 (1986). A variety of information could be used to substantiate the legitimate businesspurpose of a novel thermal use. The Commission has not restricted the natureof information that would constitute sufficient economic justification,but has suggested that cost/benefit studies might be used to provide thenecessary evidence.\118\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\118\ <T3>See </T3>Electrodyne Research Corp., 32 FERC andpara; 61,102 (1986).The determination that a new technology or novel heat use constitutes anindependent business purpose and is, therefore, consistent with a ``usefulthermal energy output'' has been a difficult and time consuming task forboth the Commission and QF certification applicants. Applicants for QFstatus have not known with certainty what information must be suppliedin order to establish the economic justification of a thermal output. Thisuncertainty has increased the difficulty of planning and developing cogenerationprojects and, in the worst cases, may encourage some applicants to tryto ``game the system'' by producing elaborate business projections fornonfunctional undertakings. Appraising the economic viability of differenttypes of new undertakings, such as greenhouses, fish farms and industrialgas plants, is very time consuming, and involves decision making over whichreasonable people can differ. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Proposed Solution </ITAG>Determining the independent business purpose of the thermal output doesnot assure that the primary objective of the Commission's cogenerationrules is actually met. The existence, or lack, of an independent businesspurpose does not assure that there is a net gain in energy efficiency.In place of the independent business purpose test for new or non-standardthermal uses in qualifying cogeneration facilities, the Commission proposesto require that applicants demonstrate that the revenues received fromthe sale of heat or steam are equal to or greater than the cost of an equivalentquantity of the QF's fuel input. This test for novel thermal uses wouldrequire that the applicant sell heat or steam at a price that would atleast compensate for the cost of the fuel consumed to provide it. The revenueswould not include income from the sale of electricity or any other product.Therefore, no qualifying cogeneration facility would ``give away'' heatto continue a useful thermal purpose only to meet the standards to qualifyfor status.Where the thermal user is not affiliated with the facility, evidence ofan arms-length transaction has been taken to indicate economic justificationfor the thermal use. In cases where the cogenerator and the thermal userare affiliated, more elaborate documentation of the economic justificationhas been required. A contract between a QF and a nonaffiliated heat orsteam customer that specified a price per Btu for energy delivered to theuser that is equal to or greater than the Btu equivalent price of the cogenerator'sfuel actually used would satisfy this test.\1\\1\\9\<NOTE/> Transactions between affiliated entities would be subjectto the same standard, but additional documentation on the derivation ofthe price attributed to the steam or heat transfer may be required to substantiatethat prices between affiliates are fair representations of market value.The Commission solicits comments on what kind of documentation would benecessary. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\9\ The Commission would consider requests for confidentialtreatment of such information pursuant to andSection; 388.112 of the regulations.18 CFR 388.112 (1987).The Commission invites comment on how it might most easily substantiatetransfer prices among affiliates. By setting a standard based on the pricepaid for thermal energy rather than the business purpose, the Commissionintends to streamline the requirements for obtaining QF status and to discouragetoken thermal uses which do not improve the efficiency of energy utilization.E. Bottoming-Cycle<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background</ITAG>Bottoming-cycle cogeneration facilities are cogeneration facilities whichuse a single energy source first to produce useful thermal energy and thento recover heat left over from the first process application and use itto produce electric power. In other words, the sequential process in bottoming-cyclesis first thermal applications and second electric generation. Bottoming-cycle cogeneration plants are far less common than topping-cyclefacilities. Of the approximately 3,998 QF filings received by the Commission,only 9 are listed as bottoming-cycle cogeneration facilities. Nevertheless,the technology is well established and the Commission's regulations providestandards for bottoming-cycle QFs. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Problem</ITAG>Technically, opportunities to install bottoming-cycle cogeneration facilitiesare far fewer than for topping-cycles because most thermal applicationsuse energy at relatively low temperatures_compared to either the combustiontemperature of the fuel or the temperature at which the turbine generatoroperates. Many bottoming-cycle designs require supplemental firing to increasethe energy level of the reject heat used for electric generation. Thissupplemental firing reduces the natural energy efficiency of cogeneration.Under the current rules, bottoming-cycle designs with unlimited supplementalfiring could easily lead to program abuses. For example, a modest amountof process heat at a low temperature and pressure could be fed into a wasteheat recovery boiler with large amounts of supplemental firing. At theextreme, these configurations could become power plants embodying littleof the improved energy efficiency the program is intended to capture. Some proposed bottoming-cycle cogeneration facilities have received QFcertification as small power production facilities using waste heat asthe primary energy source.\1\\2\\0\<NOTE/> But if these facilities are treated as small power productionapplications, they are subject to the size limits. Furthermore, the classificationof waste under the small power production category is already sufficientlydifficult without trying to expand the definition to cover some types ofcogeneration designs as well as energy sources. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\0\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Energy Technology Engineering Center, Rockwell InternationalCorp., 31 FERC andpara; 62,357 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposed Solution</ITAG>The potential for abuse of bottoming-cycle QF status could be substantiallyreduced by imposing an operating standard on such facilities. Unfortunately,it would be very difficult to establish the necessary engineering standardsto determine overall contributions to thermal and power uses for bottoming-cycleconfigurations. The Commission solicits comments on a test for bottoming-cyclecogeneration facilities with supplementary firing.On an annual basis beginning with the in service date, the proposed supplementaryfiring standard would require that all energy inputs subsequent to thermaluse not exceed one half the energy input into the thermal application.Under this limitation, energy applied to supplementary firing would beconstrained and could never become the major energy input to the entiresystem. Of course, it would be possible to use wasteful amounts of energyin the first thermal stage application in order to reduce supplementaryfuel consumption. The Commission expects that this strategy would be discouragedby the cost of the additional fuel, and the likely impact on the thermalprocess of greatly increasing the flow of fuel and combustion air, andby properly set avoided cost rates for utility purchases of electricity.Bottoming-cycle applications that do not use supplementary firing wouldnot be affected by this change.<ITAG tagnum="85">VI. Technical Standards For Small Power Production Facilities</ITAG>A.WasteUnder PURPA, a qualifying small power production facility must produceelectric energy ``solely by the use, as a primary energy source, a biomass,waste, renewable resources, geothermal resources, or any combination thereof* * *'' \1\\2\\1\<NOTE/> The term ``waste'' was not defined in the statute. The ConferenceReport merely stated that ``the term `waste' in the definition of `smallpower production facility' includes wood and liquid or solid waste.'' \1\\2\\2\<NOTE/> In its final rule implementing PURPA, the Commission definedwaste as ``by-product materials other than biomass.'' \1\\2\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\1\ 16 U.S.C. 796(17)(A)(i) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\2\ H.R. Rep. No. 1750, 95 Cong., 2nd Sess. 89, <T3>reprinted in </T3>1978 U.S. Code Cong. and Ad.

The Commission proposed the followingdefinition of ``waste'' in its notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Docket No.RM79-54): The term ``waste'' covers municipal, agricultural, and industrialwastes and includes any byproduct materials of any operation for whichmarket value is less than disposal cost. Waste may be solid, liquid orgaseous. Municipal sewage sludge would be a qualifying fuel under thisdefinition. Manure and cornstalks are examples of qualifying agriculturalwastes. Wood derived waste and debris from sawmill, lumbering, or pulpmill operations would qualify as biologically derived industrial wastes.This proposed definition of waste did not receive favorable public response.All of the examples of waste were subsumed within the definition of biomass,thus leaving no concrete example of what type of material would constitutewaste. Moreover, the commenters pointed out extensive problems in applyingthe economic test, ``market value is less than disposal cost.'' Calculationof both market value and disposal cost is difficult and both are likelyto fluctuate widely.The Commission has found it difficult to determine what constitutes a by-product.\1\\2\\4\<NOTE/> In addition to determining what constitutes a ``by-product'',the Commision has examined whether the energy source had any commericalvalue. In <T3>Stieren Farms,</T3>\1\\2\\5\<NOTE/> the Commission determined that gas from an abandoned coalmine was waste and noted that ``generally waste is an economic conceptreferring to materials whose cost of salvage or marketing exceed the costof disposal.'' Later, in <T3>Kenvil Energy Corporation,</T3>\1\\2\\6\<NOTE/> the Commission found that to be a ``waste'', the energy sourcemust be both a by-product and currently have little or no commercial value.In <T3>Pynoyl Corporation, </T3>(<T3>Pynoyl</T3>) \1\\2\\7\<NOTE/> the Commission found that low quality natural gas producedfrom a natural gas well which had little or no commercial value could beconsidered waste. The Commission held that the gas was an undesired productand was a by-product of the distillate recovery process. However, the Commissionalso reasoned that low quality gas is an undesired result of the searchfor high quality gas. The Commission stated:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\4\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Kenvil Energy Corporation, 23 FERC 61,139 (1983), andTulsa Energy Corporation, 19 FERC andpara; 61,331 (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\5\ 17 FERC andpara; 61,260, (1980) at 61,509.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\6\ 23 FERC andpara; 61,139 (1983).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\7\ 38 FERC andpara; 61,136 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="21">Consistent with the intent of PURPA, we believe that natural gas whichis not commercially marketable because of its poor quality may be consideredto be a by-product. Whenever a drilling operation is undertaken, the desiredresult is that a remarketable product will be found. If the gas which isactually found has no commercial value because of its poor quality, thegas is an undesired product.\1\\2\\8\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\8\ In <T3>Pynoyl, </T3>the Commission recognized that its decision could resultin an increase in applications proposing to use low quality natural gasas a primary energy source in small power production facilities. In anticipationof this increase, the Commission, in Order No. 471, established genericstandards for determining whether natural gas is commercially unmarketable.38 FERC at 61,361. Interpretation of ``Waste'' Natural Gas, III FERC Stats.andamp; Regs., andpara; 30,744, 52 FR 19,308 (May 22, 1987). <T3>See, </T3>18 CFR 2.400 (1987).The Commission has found that applying the by-product test is cumbersomeand does not adequately address the issue of what constitutes ``waste''.The Commission believes that waste can be determined by examining onlythe economic value of the energy source rather than also determining whetherit is a by-product of some manufacturing, production or industrial process.The Commission further believes that a strict adherence to the by-producttest might exclude some energy sources that, although not technically by-products,are generally considered to be waste because they have no value. Therefore,the Commission proposes to redefine waste as ``an energy source other thanbiomass that has essentially no commercial value at the time and placein which it is produced.''This proposed definition would account for the time when the energy sourceis produced as well as the area in which it is produced. An energy sourcemay have some economic value but because of market conditions at the timeit may have no commercial value. For example, an energy source producedin one area of the country may not be marketable in the area in which itis produced but may be marketable in another area. However, transportationcosts may make the sale uneconomic. The Commission is requesting commentsas to how to account for these geographic differences in determining whetheran energy source is waste.The Commission is also proposing to adopt a list of specific energy sourcesmaterials that it considers to be waste. The list is intended to be illustrative,and not inclusive. In addition to these specific energy sources, identifiedbelow, the Commission recognizes that there are other potential sourcesof ``waste'' energy that meet the definitions of waste. Some of these potentialenergy sources have already been included in various applications for certificationas for example, oil-impregnated diatomaceous shale, residual heat, andheat from exothermic reactions. For other potential ``waste'' energy sources,there is no Commission precedent. These include char and tar (coal by-products),crankcase oil, oil shale retort residues and oil storage tank bottoms (oilby-products). The Commission invites comment on whether additional energysources should be added to the list of specific energy sources that meetthe definition of ``waste''.The Commission proposes to treat the following specified energy sourcesas ``waste'': (1) Anthracite culm producted prior to July 23, 1985.\1\\2\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\9\ The Commission determined that anthracite culm producedprior to July 23, 1985, is waste in Electrodyne Research Corp., 32 FERCandpara;61,102 (1985). (2) Anthracite coal refuse that has a heating value no greater than 6,000Btu per pound and that has 45 percent or more ash.\1\\3\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\0\ This includes anthracite culm produced after July23, 1985, anthracite silt and other anthracite refuse from mining operations.An analysis of data on the quality of anthracite and anthracite refuse(including culm and silt) that is being purchased by electric utilitiesfor boiler fuel shows that anthracite refuse that has a heating value nogreater than 6,000 Btu per pound and an ash content of at least 45 percentincludes less than 1 percent of anthracite considered to be of commercialgrade during the five year period 1981-1985. (3) Bituminous coal refuse that has a heat content no greater than 9,500Btu per pound and that has 25 percent or more ash.\1\\3\\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\1\ The category includes: <ITAG tagnum="28">(1) Cleaning plant tailings from coal cleaning operations;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) Gob (loose coal refuse) left behind on the floor of mined areas;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(3) Bone or bone coal (carbonaceous shale that has a high contentof noncombustible materials); and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(4) Other bituminous coal refuse, such as ``pond coal,'' ``filtercake'' and ``screen refuse.'' Pond coal is the very fine coal that is carriedaway from the cleaning plant with the wash water and is allowed to settlein ponds. ``Filter cake'' is the solid or semi-solid material separatedfrom a liquid and remaining on a filter after pressure or vacuum filtration.``Screen refuse'' is a coal-bearing refuse generated in the crushing andscreening of coal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Practically no bituminous coal with a heat content of 9,500 But perpound or less and 25 percent or more ash was purchased by electric utilitiesduring the five-year period 1981-1985.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The heat content of coal decreases as the moisture and ash contentof the coal increases. When a high ash and a high moisture content combinein the same coal, the result is a low Btu refuse. However, the moisturecontent can frequently be reduced by a drying operation, thus increasingthe heat content of the coal and rendering it into a marketable product.Consequently, a bituminous coal, regardless of its type and origin, mustbe both low in Btu content and high in ash content in order to be ``waste.''</ITAG>(4) Top or bottom subbituminous coal that has a heat content of 8,000 Btuper pound or less and a sulfur content of 1.5 percent or more and whichhas been determined to be waste by the Bureau of Land Management.\132\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\132\ The Commission determined that top or bottom subbituminouscoal was ``waste'' in Big Horn Energy Partners, 38 FERC andpara; 61,265 (1987).In some areas of the Powder River Coal Basin (covering northeastern Wyomingand southeastern Montana), the top and bottom layers of subbituminous coalseams are inferior in quality to the main, central portions of the seams.Where these quality differences occur, a thin layer of coal at the topmay be removed and mixed with the spoil. After the central portion of theseam is mined, a thin layer of coal at the bottom of the seam may be leftunmined. In most strip mining operations, the bulk of the ``top'' and ``bottom''coal is blended in with coal from the main central portions of the coalseams and is marketed as single commercial product. However, if the ``top''or ``bottom'' coal is so inferior that it cannot be blended and still meetbuyers' quality requirements, such coal is waste. Since most of the subbituminouscoal in the Powder River Coal Basin is from Federal lands, the determinationof what ``top'' and ``bottom'' coal is waste should be made by the Bureauof Land Management.(5) Lignite produced in association with the production of montan wax,and lignite that becomes exposed as a result of such a mining operation.\133\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\133\ Lignite is a low rank coal in which the alteration ofvegetal material has proceeded farther than in peat but not as far as insubbituminous coal. In a few areas of the country, lignite contains montanwax that is recovered for sale as feedstock for the manufacture of candies,phonograph records and polishes. In American Lignite Products Company,25 FERC andpara; 61,054 (1983), the Commission certificated a small powerproduction facility that proposed to use lignite residue resulting fromthe production of montan wax.(6) Gaseous fuels, except (a) synthesis gas from coal, and (b) naturalgas (including natural gas liquids and liquefiables) from gas and oil wellsunless the natural gas meets the requirements of andSection; 2.400 of theCommission's regulations.\134\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\134\ This category includes refinery gases, coke oven gas,blast furnace gas, carbon black gas, and coal mine gas. It also includes``waste'' natural gas as defined in Order No. 471, Interpretation of ``Waste''Natural Gas, III FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara; 30,744, 52 FR 19,308 (May22, 1987). <T3>See</T3>, 18 CFR 2.400 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28">Synthesis gas from coal is not included because synthesis gas plantscan be designed to produce a low Btu gas (less than 300 Btu per Mcf) anda residual char that has little or no market value. If neither of the productscan be sold commercially, both could qualify as ``waste.'' This would simplybe a roundabout way of using good quality coal to produce ``waste.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Refinery gases are a by-product of petroleum refining. Refinery gaseshave a high Btu content (1000+ Btu per cubic foot) but may be unsuitablefor pipeline use because of impurities. These gases are usually used inthe refinery to generate process heat. Excess gases are sometimes soldas power plant fuel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Coke oven gas is formed in the production of coke. In producing coke,some of the coal used is converted to gases or vapors. After valuable productsare recovered from the gases, the noncondensable portion is called cokeoven gas. Coke oven gas has a heating value of 575 to 590 Btu per cubicfoot and burns readily because of its high free-hydrogen content.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Blast furnace gas is used in mills for heating furnaces, for gas enginesand for steam generation. Blast furnace gas is variable in quality butgenerally has a high carbon monoxide content and low heating value (about85 Btu per cubic foot).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Carbon black is of nearly pure elementary carbon composed of smallspherical particles that are usually produced from natural gas and otherhydrocarbons by partial combustion or thermal decomposition under carefullycontrolled conditions. The flue gases from carbon black manufacture havea residual heat value of 60 Btu per cubic foot and can be burned to producesteam.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Coal mine gas comes from abandoned or active coal mines. When an abandonedunderground coal mine is sealed off, gases containing elevated concentrationsof methane may accumulate in the mine. The gas mixture may be tapped andburned for heating nearby homes or for the production of steam. Activeunderground coal mines are ventilated to remove methane and other noxiousgases. Methane gas may be of pipeline quality but is not under enough pressureto be suitable for long distance transport.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The mined out areas in underground coal mines employing the longwallmining method are filled with gob (a mixture of unmined coal and roof rock)that is usually a source of methane gas emissions. Gob gas is a mixtureof mine air and methane and its Btu content varies. Vertical bore holesthat are used to drain methane gas from the coal seam may then be usedto drain gob gas. Both types of gas have been used for space heating andfor steam production.</ITAG>(7) Petroleum coke that cannot be commercially marketed.\135\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\135\ Petroleum coke ordinarily has less than 1 percent ash,has a high fixed carbon content (about 90 percent), is very low in volatilematter (6 percent to 11 percent) and usually contains more than 4.5 percentsulfur. For these reasons, it is not a very desirable boiler fuel.(8) Rubber tires that cannot be commercially marketed.\136\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\136\ Tires are reported to have an average heating valueof 14,500 Btu per pound.(9) Plastics that cannot be commercially marketed.\137\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\137\ Plastics refer to synthetic or natural resins that canbe molded by heat or pressure into finished products.(10) Materials that a government agency has certified for disposal by combustion.\138\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\138\ Various industrial processes generate hazardous wasteby-products and contaminated materials frequently. These by-products andmaterials originate from the manufacture of paints, textiles, paper andink or processes associated with printing, metal working or those usingnonchloride hydrocarbons. One method of disposing of these by-productsand materials is by combustion.<ITAG tagnum="28">Defining the material as waste simply recognizes the obvious factthat it has no commercial value. The definition in no way affects the requirementthat the combustion of the material and its use as fuel could be undertakenonly in compliance with all applicable Federal, state or municipal environmentalcontrol laws or regulations and the approval of the appropriate governmentalbodies.</ITAG>The Commission's proposed definition of ``waste'' would be applied prospectivelyonly. Furthermore, once an application for qualifying status for a particularproject is granted, certification for that project may not later be revokedon the ground that the ``waste'' material is later found to have commercialvalue. This requirement is necessary to protect the small power productionfacility against the loss of or inability to obtain financing.B. Permissible ``Minor Uses'' of Fossil Fuels in Small Power ProductionFacilitiesUnder the FPA as amended by PURPA, a small power production facility mayuse ``minimum amounts'' of fossil fuels for purposes of ignition, startup,testing, flame stabilization and control uses and also to alleviate orprevent unanticipated equipment outages and emergencies directly affectingpublic health, safety or welfare.\139\<NOTE/> In implementing these statutory requirements, the Commissionadopted regulations allowing a small power production facility to use,in the aggregate, up to 25 percent fossil fuels (natural gas, oil, or coal)for the listed statutory purposes.\140\<NOTE/> The Commission subsequently authorized ``minor uses'' offossil fuels in addition to those specified in the statute, provided thatthe use in question enhances the efficiency of the facility's essentialfixed assets.\141\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\139\ 16 U.S.C. 796(17)(B) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\140\ Order No. 70, 45 FR 17959, 17966, FERC Statutes andRegulations, Regulations Preambles 1977-1981 andpara; 30,134 at 30,945; <T3>amended, </T3>45 FR 33958, 33962, FERC Statutes and Regulations, RegulationsPreambles 1977-1981 andpara; 30,160 at 31,113 (1980).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\141\ <T3>See </T3>LUZ Solar Partners Ltd., 30 FERC andpara; 61,122 (1985); PowerDevelopers, Inc., 32 FERC andpara; 61,101 (1985), <T3>reh. denied, </T3>34 FERC andpara; 61,136 (1986; Northeastern Power Co.,34 FERC andpara; 61,197 (1986); LUZ Solar Partners II Ltd., 34 FERC andpara;61,383 (1986).The current 25 percent test has resulted in some difficulty in obtainingadequate information for processing certification applications where applicantsenumerate uses other than those permitted in the statute but do not explainhow the essential fixed assets are being used more efficiently by suchuses. Additionally, various uses under the essentially fixed assets testhave been problematic.\142\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\142\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Hydro Corp. of Pennsylvania, 43 FERC andpara; 61,276(1988) where a diesel engine was proposed for a hydroelectric project.In the Commission's recent conference on PURPA, Southern California EdisonCompany argued that the limit on supplementary use of fossil fuels shouldbe reduced from 25 percent to 10 percent.\143\<NOTE/> Other commenters not only opposed more stringent fuel useregulations, but favored raising the limit to 50 percent, citing the repealof portions of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FuelUse Act) as a reflection of Congressional intent to ease the restrictionson the use of fossil fuels. They also claimed that increasing the allowableuse of fossil fuels would have a positive effect on the dispatchabilityand load-following capabilities of technologies relying on intermittentresources,<T3> i.e.,</T3> solar energy.\144\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\143\ <T3>See</T3> Comments to the Commission's Conference on PURPA, Docket No.RM87-12-000, filed by Southern California Edison Company at 7. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\144\ Comments to the Commission's Conference on PURPA, DocketNo. RM87-12-000, filed by LUZ at 2-5, Hawaiian Sugar Planters Associationat 4; Solar Stirling Industries, Inc. at 3; Renewable Energy Instituteat 9. The Fuel Use Act was intended, in pertinent part, to prohibit or,as appropriate, minimize the use of natural gas and petroleum for the benefitof present and future generations, while encouraging greater use of coaland other alternative fuels as primary energy sources. 42 U.S.C. 8301 (1982).Based on the Commission's experience with QF applications since FiscalYear 1985, the Commission believes that it may be appropriate to reestablishthe fossil fuel use percentage at a level such that any use below sucha level would be presumed to meet the statutory uses and other minor usespermitted by the regulations. This proposal would allow the Commissionto avoid time-consuming inquiries into the specific uses of fossil fuelsin small power production facilities. The administratively burdensome ``essentialfixed assets'' test would be eliminated in favor of a simple percentagerule. For example, a limit of 15 percent fossil fuel use would encompass virtuallyall of the small power producer applications reviewed by the Commission.The basis for this percentage is the information contained in prior applicationswhere specific information was provided on amounts of fossil fuel to beused for the specified statutory purposes. The following two tables providesuch information for applications involving ``waste'' burning QFs and forbiomass QFs. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>9,L2,i1,s75,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10</C><T4>Waste._Percentage of Fossil Fuel Use</T4><H1> </H1><H1>(0-5)</H1><H1>(6-10)</H1><H1>(11-15)</H1><H1>(16-20)</H1><H1>(20-25)</H1><H1>Total \145\ </H1><H1>Unspecified</H1><H1>Total \145\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">QFs<D>20</D><D>0</D><D>1</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>21</D><D>71</D><D>91</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent<D>95</D><D/><D>5</D><D/><D/><D>100</D><D/><D/><F>\145\ Total filings reviewed.

It would also be unnecessary to determine whetherproposed uses of fossil fuels would enhance the efficiency of facilities'essential fixed assets. Whatever percentage limitation is established wouldbe considered sufficiently minor as to meet the statutory intent of a minoruse without further inquiry. The Commission invites comments as to whatpercentage would be appropriate as the upper limit for fossil fuel use.The Commission occasionally receives requests to certify small power producersthat purchase a portion of the energy input to the facility in the formof electricity \149\<NOTE/> or steam \150\<NOTE/> instead of direct use of fossil fuels such as oil, gas andcoal. Although the regulations speak to the use of fossil fuels for minoruses, such indirect uses of fossil fuels are also considered as input tothe facility in determining the proportions of energy supplied from waste,renewable, geothermal or hydroenergy sources.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\149\ McKee Products, Inc., 43 FERC andpara; 61,534 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\150\ LaJet Energy Co., 43 FERC andpara; 61,288 (1988).The Commission, however, recognizes that under certain circumstances individualwaivers of the percentage limitation may be appropriate. The Commissionsolicits comments on whether such waiver requests should be entertained.If waiver requests are allowed, the Commission also solicits comments onthe criteria to be used to determine whether to grant these requests.Most recently, Representatives Philip Sharp and Carlos Moorhead, Chairmanand Ranking Minority Member of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power,respectively, brought to the Commission's attention the possibility thatsetting the maximum allowable use of non-renewable fossil fuel at 15 percent,rather than 25 percent, may adversely affect the promising technologicalbreakthroughs in solar technology that motivated Congress to increase themaximum size of solar facilities that can be exempted from federal andstate law under section 210(e) of PURPA from 30 to 80 megawatts. This isnot the intent of the Commission, and the Commission solicits comment onthis possibility. The Commission also requests comment on whether thisconcern would be adequately accommodated and the development of solar technologyfurther encouraged through the possibility of waivers of a percentage limitation.The Commission is also concerned that any change in the allowed amountof fossil fuel might adversely impact small power production facilitiesin the planning stage. Commentary is requested on the need for a transitionperiod if changes are adopted.C. Power Production Capacity<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background</ITAG>The electrical capacity of a small power production facility is of crucialimportance under the PURPA regulatory scheme. By statutory definition,small power production facilities must be no larger than 80 megawatts.Moreover, certain of the regulatory exemptions generally afforded to QFsare not extended to small power production facilities larger than 30 megawatts.Facilities powered by ``waste,'' wind and hydropower are subject to boththe FPA and PUHCA if their capacity exceeds 30 megawatts. Facilities firedwith biomass would be subject to the FPA but exempt from PUHCA. Geothermalfacilities and solar facilities (for a limited period of two years) areexempt from the regulatory provisions of both statutes, up to the maximumallowable size of 80 megawatts.Many types of projects exhibit economies of scale in size ranges up toa few hundred megawatts. Such projects can produce electricity more cheaplyif sized larger. But if sized too large, a facility may be exposed to regulationas a utility or may fall outside the definition of a small power productionfacility. A clear tension exists between the economic motivation of projectdevelopers and the statutory framework. For this reason, the Commissionhas repeatedly been confronted with questions of how to measure the electricalcapacity of a small power production facility.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Problem</ITAG>Small power production facilities employ a wide range of energy sourcesand technologies. This variation greatly complicates the task of determininga particular facility's electrical capacity. There are two reasons forthis. First, the on-site station use of electricity can vary enormously.Station use is the use of power in the power plant itself. For example,electricity is typically used to operate boiler feedwater pumps, and inducedand forced draft fans, and for excitation of the generator. All of thesestation uses are consumed in the process of power production. Only thenet output (gross output less station use) of a facility is available toconsumers of electricity, and the Commission has concluded in <T3>Power Developers, Inc.</T3>\151\<NOTE/> that utilities are only obligated to purchase a QF's netoutput.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\151\ 32 FERC andpara; 61,101 (1985), <T3>reh. denied, </T3>34 FERC andpara; 61,136 (1986).Station use of power depends on the production process employed. Hydroelectricfacilities require very little station use of power. Geothermal facilitiesmay require a large amount, since geothermal fluids must be pumped throughthe facility and reinjected into the ground. Power production from municipalsolid waste may also require a large input of station use for processingthe garbage. The station use problem makes reliance on the generator'snameplate rating an unreliable guide to the facility's actual productioncapability.Station use is not the only complicating factor. The output of a powerplant can be limited by any of a number of elements in the facility. Ina Rankine cycle steam plant, the limited component could be the boiler,the turbo-generator, or the condenser. For large utility power plants,the individual components are engineered to operate harmoniously. But thecomponents of a small power production facility are typically not customdesigned and produced. These projects often use a variety of ``off theshelf'' components. Discussions with small power producers have indicatedthat standard turbine sizes are sometimes ordered that are oversized relativeto the available energy resource. Again, the generator's nameplate ratingmay be a poor guide to the facility's real capability.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposed Soution</ITAG>The Commission is proposing to codify its decision in <T3>Occidental Geothermal Inc</T3>.,\152\<NOTE/> in which we explained:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\152\ 17 FERC andpara; 61,231 (1981). <ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission will consider the ``power production capacity'' ofa facility to be the maximum net output of the facility which can be safelyand reliably achieved under the most favorable operating conditions likelyto occur over a period of several years. The net output of the facilityis its send out after subtraction of the power used to operate auxiliaryequipment in the facility necessary for power generation (such as pumps,blowers fuel preparation machinery, and exciters) and for other essentialelectricity uses in the facility from the gross generator output.</ITAG>We are proposing to add a new andSection; 292.202(p) that will reflect theconcept of net capacity outlined in <T3>Occidental Geothermal</T3>. The Commission recognizes that this definitiondoes not eliminate the need for some measure of judgment in assessing thecapacity of a small power production facility. We have tentatively concludedthat the exercise of reasonable judgment is necessary for determining afacility's capacity. Any other approach, such as using nameplate capacity,appears to overlook the large variation in station use of power among smallpower production technologies. The Commission believes that its proposeddefinition will help QF certification applicants by sparing them the needto research the record of case decisions since 1981. Comments are invitedon the merits of the proposed definition. In addition to the question of <T3>how </T3>a QF's capacity is to be measured, the Commission must alsodecide <T3>where </T3>the measurement is to be made. Small power production facilitiesmay comprise interconnection equipment, transformers, and radial transmissionlines as well as the generator. Since electrical losses occur in all suchequipment, the capacity of a facility will vary if measured at differentpoints in the facility. The capacity of a powerplant has traditionally been measured at the busbar.However, in <T3>Malacha Power Project</T3>, <T3>Inc</T3>. (<T3>Malacha</T3>),\153\<NOTE/> the Commission ruled that:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\153\ 41 FERC andpara; 61,350 (1987). <ITAG tagnum="20">``the electric power production capacity of the facility is the capacitythat the electric power production equipment delivers to the point of interconnectionwith the purchasing electric utility's transmission system.'' \154\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\154\ <T3>Id</T3>. at 61,946.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The logic of the <T3>Malacha </T3>order was that capacity should be measured at the ``outerenvelope'' of the facility. Since switchyards and radial transmission lineswere found to be part of the facility,\155\<NOTE/> the facility's capacity should be measured at the end ofsuch switchyards and lines. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\155\ <T3>See </T3>Clarion Power Co. (Clarion), 39 FERC andpara; 61,317 (1987);Sycamore Cogeneration Co. (Sycamore), 40 FERC andpara; 61,237 (1987) wherethe Commission determined that a QF facility included transmission linesas long as they are used for transmitting the QF's power to the purchasingutility and transmitting backup, supplemental and maintenance power tothe QF. Apart from appearing consistent with the finding that a QF can includecertain interconnection and transmission facilities, the <T3>Malacha </T3>approach provides one other benefit to small power producers.Larger generation facilities can be constructed than if capacity were measuredat the busbar. In effect, certain transmission and transformer losses arecounted as internal losses in the facility. The <T3>Malacha </T3>approach also has certain apparent drawbacks. The needto collect data on switchyard and transmission losses is one obvious liability.The required data may be complex. Losses will vary (in a nonlinear manner)due to the influence of such factors as the weather, the load imposed onthe equipment and the power factor. The cost of collecting and analyzingsuch data would be imposed on all petitioners for QF certification, throughthe filing fee. The additional factors that affect transmission and switchyardlosses may also make the capacity of individual QFs more uncertain, andsubject to challenge if the factors change. Moreover, the <T3>Malacha </T3>approach is inconsistent with the approach is inconsistentwith the approach used to determine the capacity of utilities' generationresources. If the capacity of utility powerplants were evaluated at thebusbar and QFs were evaluated after transformation and transmission, theQFs may be underpaid for their capacity. This is likely to occur becausethe utilities' power must also be stepped up to transmission voltage andcarried over transmission lines. These losses must be treated consistentlyin order for QFs to be paid a correct measure of avoided cost. The Commissionhas recognized this need by including line losses as a factor which mayaffect avoided cost.\156\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\156\ <T3>See</T3> 18 CFR 292.304(e) (1987); ADFAC NOPR. On balance, the Commission believes that its statutory mandate to encourageQFs would best be met by measuring a QF's capacity at the busbar. The alternativeapproach of measuring capacity at the point of interconnection appearsto raise problems that far outweigh the few benefits. The Commission wishesto emphasize that any rule which may be adopted would not affect the qualifyingstatus of any facility already certified. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Environmental Finding</ITAG>Commission regulations require that an environmental assessment or an environmentalimpact statement must be prepared for any Commission action that may havea significant adverse effect on the human environment.\1\\5\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission has categorically excluded certain actionsfrom this requirement as not having a significant effect on the human environment.\1\\5\\8\<NOTE/> No environmental consideration is necessary for the promulgationof a rule that is clarifying, corrective, or procedural or that does notsubstantially change the effect of legislation or regulations being amended.\1\\5\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\7\ Regulations Implementing National EnvironmentalPolicy Act, 52 FR 47897 (Dec. 17, 1987), III FERC Statutes and Regulationsandpara; 30,783 (Dec. 10, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\8\ 18 CFR 380.4 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\9\ 18 CFR 380.4(a)(2)(ii) (1987).Under this NOPR the Commission proposes to clarify its regulations on thecriteria and procedures under which cogeneration and small power productionfacilities can obtain qualifying status for PURPA benefits. The proposedapplication form is a procedural requirement specifying certain informationto be included in an application for certification. The proposed rule doesnot substantially change existing Commission regulations with respect tothe criteria and procedures by which qualifying facilities can obtain PURPAbenefits.Section 201 of PURPA includes ``waste'' as an allowable primary energysource for qualifying small power production facilities. To the extentthe Commission is proposing a revised definition of ``waste'' and providingan illustrative list of waste energy sources, this action simplifies currentCommission practice but does not substantially change the effect of theunderlying legislation.The Commission is also proposing to revise the limit on the amount of fossilfuel that can be used in a small power production facility from 25 percentof the facility's energy input to 15 percent. This 15 percent limit, however,would have encompassed virtually all of the small power production applicationsreceived by the Commission since the beginning of the PURPA program. Therefore,a prospective change in this standard should have no significant environmentaleffect.Accordingly, the Commission has determined that the proposed rule, if adopted,would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting thequality of the human environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires Federal agencies to considerwhether the rule, if promulgated, will have a ``significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.'' An agency is not requiredto make an RFA analysis, however, if it certifies that the rule will nothave such an impact.\1\\6\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\0\ 5 US.C. 605(b) (1982).The proposed rule would provide a number of benefits to small businessentities. The proposed rule would improve the usefulness of the self-qualifyingapproach for small power production and cogeneration facilities seekingto qualify for PURPA benefits (qualifying facilities of QFs). Small entitieswould benefit by avoiding the time and expense of requesting Commissioncertification. In the event that a small entity desires Commission reviewof a proposed QF (either by certification or by declaratory order), theproposed rule would reduce administrative expense by clearly spelling outthe information that needs to be filed. For facilities that have alreadybeen certified as QFs, the proposed rule under andSection; 292.207(d)(2)would provide a quick and relatively inexpensive means of ascertainingthe impact of changes to the QF. The proposed rule would provide workablealternatives to certification and should act to reduce the cost of certification.For these reasons, the Commission believes that the streamlined regulatoryprocedures applicable to QFs will have a beneficial impact on these entities.Since the impact on these small entities affected by this rule is expectedto be beneficial, the Commission does not believe the economic impact willbe ``significant'' within the meaning of the RFA. The Commission certifies,therefore, that this rule, if promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act \1\\6\\1\<NOTE/> and the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) regulations\1\\6\\2\<NOTE/> require that OMB approve certain information collection requirementsimposed by agency rule. The information collection provisions in this NOPRare being submitted to the OMB for its approval.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\1\ 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520 (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\2\ 5 CFR 1320-12 (1985).The Commission promulgated the information collection provisions of thisrule in order to streamline the process by which qualifying small powerproduction and cogeneration facilities may apply for certification andto eliminate unnecessary delays in processing certification applications.In addition, the Commission encourages facilities to follow an alternativeself-qualification procedure, which reduces the filing requirement to anaffidavit providing a basic description of the facility and a statementthat it meets the Commission's criteria. In either case, these filingsare on a one-time only basis.For a small power production or cogeneration facility that files an applicationfor certifiction, the information collection burden is estimated to be22 hours per response. The number of likely respondents is 254 based onFY 1987 filings.  For facilities that choose the self-qualification procedure, the informationcollection burden is estimated to be approximately one hour per response.The number of likely respondents is 523 based on FY 1987 filings.  Interested persons can obtain information on the information collectionprovisions by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 (Attention: Kenneth Thomasat (202) 357-5253).

Trabandt</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I concur in the issuance of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR)on the regulations governing implementation of the Public Utility RegulatoryPolicies Act of 1978 (PURPA), with several observations and reservations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">First, I am pleased that the Commission now is finally addressingthe PURPA implementation issues highlighted in the four regional PublicConferences on PURPA held in early 1987. Those issues have been awaitingaction since then, because of the Commission's primary focus on the threeelectric policy NOPRs in Docket Nos. RM88-4, 5, and 6., While I preferredstrongly that we take up and dispose of these issues first, at least wecan finally act on them in the broader context of the other pending proposals.Hopefully, in the end, we will be successful in developing a consistentand complementary set of obviously interrelated policies for the implementationof PURPA and the Federal Power Act (FPA) under these four NOPRs, as wellas the electric transmission NOPR under development at this time by theCommission staff.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I urge all interested parties in their review of this NOPR to carefullyconsider that need for consistent and complimentary policies across thebroad spectrum of interrelated issues presented in the four NOPRs and underreview in the transmission area. Parties whenever possible should reflectsuch consideration and conclusions on the various interrelated issues intheir comments in this docket. To that end, I have included as an attachmentmy opening statement at the public hearings on RM88-4, 5 and 6 on July21 and 22, 1988. I particularly invite the attention of interested partiesto the alternate approach for the pending NOPRS I recommended on page 4of the statement. I would appreciate it if commenters would comment onhow the proposals in the instant NOPR could be made consistent with andcomplementary to such an alternate approach.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, as a general matter, this proposal deals with another wholeseries of PURPA issues, including self certification of qualifying facilities,utility ownership of QFs, Efficiency and Operating standards, and a seriesof technical requirements affecting fuels and technology. The proposalcould make sweeping changes in the various requirements, which controlthe types of projects that qualify for PURPA benefits. When one standsback from the 120 page proposal, the potential bottom line is obvious toany observer. The proposal could greatly expand PURPA coverage in termsof technology, fuel, utility ownership, operations and otherwise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a result, FERC under this NOPR could dramatically liberalize qualificationfor PURPA and open the floodgates for an entire new generation of QualifiedFacilities (QFs), which under the old rules would have to be non-QF IndependentPower Producers (IPPs). The practical result would be that many independentpower projects now would receive PURPA benefits, not be subject to thePublic Utility Holding Company Act, and avoid certain state regulation.As a result, the proposal could be yet another way to force an independentcompetitive generating sector in the name of the primacy of economic efficiency.Notwithstanding Commission staff protestations to the contrary at the July13, 1988, Commission meeting, there is good reason to believe that theunderlying objective here is to make IPPs eligible for qualifications asQFs and receipt of PURPA benefits. I do not believe that result is justifiedby the existing record.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fourth, I have serious concerns about the ownership issue in thisNOPR. In my judgment, Congress made unambiguously clear its intent withregard to ownership of QFs in PURPA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under sections 3(17)(C) and 3(18)(B) of the FPA as amended by PURPAa QF can only be ``owned by a person not primarily engaged in the generationor sale of a electric power (other than electric power solely from cogenerationfacilities or small power production facilities).'' (16 U.S.C. 796(17)(C)and (18)(B) (1982).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The terms `qualifying small power production facility' and `qualifyingcogeneration facility' exclude facilities which are owned by a person whois primarily engaged in the generation or sale of electric power. Electricutilities may participate in an entity which owns such facilities withother persons and such entity could qualify under these definitions. <T3>The test of this case is whether the entity which owns the facilityis primarily engaged in the generation or sale of electric power otherthan in connection with its ownership of the cogeneration facilities orsmall power production facilities.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(H.R. No. 1750, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 89, </ITAG><T3>reprinted in </T3>1978 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Ad. News 7797, 7823, <T3>and in </T3>FERC Statutes and Regulations andpara; 5151 at 5097). (Emphasisadded)<ITAG tagnum="21">In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) leading to the adoptionof its current ownership criteria, the Commission stated:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[U]nder a literal interpretation of the Conference Committee's statement,several electric utilities could from a subsidiary which owned small powerproduction or cogeneration facilities. Such a subsidiary would constitutean entity which is not primarily engaged in the generation or sale of electricpower other than in connection with its ownership of cogeneration or smallpower production facilities. Under such an interpretation the subject facilitywould be eligible to receive qualifying status.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Docket No. RM79-54, 44 Fed. Reg. 3882, FERC Statutes and Regulations,Proposed Regulations 1977-1981 andpara; 32,028 at 32,333 (1981))</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, the Commission declined to adopt this position, because itbelieved that ``the thrust of section 201 of PURPA is to limit the advantagesof qualifying status to cogeneration and small power production facilitieswhich are not owned exclusively by electric utilities or their subsidiaries.''Consequently, the Commission proposed that QFs be limited to 50 percentownership by electric utilities, public utility holding companies, or theirsubsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as ``ownership restriction'').</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the final rule, the Commission noted that several commenters tothe NOPR agreed with the Commission that, under a literal interpretationof the Conference Report, electric utilities could form subsidiaries whichwould own QFs, and such subsidiaries would not be ``primarily engaged inthe generation or sale of electric power other than in connection withits ownership of cogeneration or small power production facilities.'' (<T3>See</T3> Order No. 70, Final Rule, Small Power Production and CogenerationFacilities_Qualifying Status, Docket No. RM79-54, 45 Fed. Reg. 17595, FERCStatutes and Regulations, Regulations Preambles 1977-1981 andpara; 30,134at 30,953 (1980)). Thus, utility subsidiaries could own cogeneration andsmall power production facilities without such facilities losing theirqualifying status. However, the Commission again declined to adopt thisposition in its final rule, restating its belief that the thrust of section201 was to limit the advantages of qualifying status to facilities whichare not ``owned primarily'' by electric utilities or their subsidiaries.The Commission concluded that the rulemaking comments did not provide sufficientreasons to change the percentage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The threshold question for the Commission today is whether PURPA,as a matter of law apart from any relevant policy consideration arisingfrom the pending NOPRs, would sanction the ownership through an affiliateor subsidiary of a QF by an electric utility primarily engaged in the generationor sale of non-cogeneration electric power. Or, put another way, whetherthe Commission's judgment at the time of initial PURPA implementation notto allow corporate veils to be used to extend PURPA section 210 benefitsto electric utilities remains legally valid. On this issue, the plain meaningof the statute and the clear intent of Congress in the Conference Reportsupport persuasively the original conclusion of the Commission adoptedin the 1980 regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nevertheless, the Commission's Office of General Counsel (OGC) hascompleted an exhaustive, if not necessarily wholly objective, review ofthe legislative history of this issue in PURPA and not surprisingly concludedthat under settled rules of statutory construction the Commission now couldreinterpret legally the ownership limitation to allow utility subsidiariesto own 100% of QFs. The OGC opines that permitting utility subsidiariesto own 100% of the QFs thus should not be viewed as a reversal of the Commission'sprior interpretation of PURPA, but may be characterized solely as a ``newpolicy position.'' That so-called new policy position could be adopted,accordingly to OGC, if the Commission obtains evidence in this Docket supportingthe conclusion that 100% utility subsidiary ownership fosters the purposeof PURPA to encourage cogeneration, without offending Congressional concernabout exempting electric utilities from the FPA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">That conclusion here also would support as a matter of law, it isargued, (a) 50% direct ownership of QFs by an electric utility or 100%direct ownership if not more than 50% of revenues are attributable to non-QFpower sales; (b) 100% direct ownership by (i) subsidiaries of electricutilities, which could include an IPP subsidiary, and (ii) electric utilityholding companies; and (c) QF direct ownership of IPPs where no more than50% of the revenues came from non-QF power sales. These ownership possibilitiescould be coupled to a restriction in some form on sales by utility-subsidiaryQFs to the parent utility or on location of the utility-subsidiary QF inthe utility's service territory, if the Commission decided such restrictionwas necessary because of concerns about utility monopoly power or potentialabuses due to self-dealing. Thus, OGC concludes, the Commission has broadlatitude in this rulemaking docket to reinterpret the ownership test inthe statute as a ``new policy position'' and completely restructure the1980 regulations to effectuate the new policy position.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I shall await the comments of interested parties as to the OGC position,rather than debate it at length at this point in the proceedings. Sufficeit to say that thus far I remain unmoved by the analysis presented to theCommission, which might be characterized uncharitably as revisionist legislativehistory and analysis, to the effect that somehow Congress didn't reallymean what it said or, in the alternative, Congress should not have meantit, in light of our new policy position. For me, any effort ten years afterenactment of PURPA to find the corporate veil suddenly impenetrable, asif resurrected <T3>sua sponte</T3> from the legal trash heap, will require a great dealmore in objective and persuasive argumentation that that presented thusfar to the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Next, the Commission here is proposing to make a fundamental shiftin the processing of QF applications from Commission certification to self-certification.The Commission already has received communications from QF and independentpower officials urging a cautious approach to this proposal. In a nutshell,they are very concerned that the current form of Commission certificationmay continue to be necessary in order to provide adequate legal certaintyof the project's eligibility for QF status and resulting PURPA benefits.That legal certainty is particularly important for the financial communityin the context of project-type financing and for electric utilities interms of applicable law and avoided cost rates. I believe that the Commissionmust be very careful in assessing and responding to those quite legitimateconcerns reflecting the real world requirements for QF project development.The Commission, in my judgment, cannot attempt to abandon Commission certificationunless and until there is persuasive evidence that self-certification asa practical matter will be fully adequate to provide the necessary legalcertainty to assure the predictable development and financing of futureQF projects. Only that approach would support the fundamental PURPA section210 objective of encouragement of cogeneration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, I remain concerned about the potential impact and effectof the proposed changes in the technical area, particularly the sequentialuse of energy. The proposal here would liberalize significantly the currentrequirement such that potentially much larger power plants could qualifyfor QF status. This is one example of the effect where IPP-type projectsmay now more easily qualify for QF status, thus expanding the scope ofthe PURPA cogeneration program beyond original Congressional intent. Irecommend that commenters review all the technical proposals and carefullyassess the potential aggregate effects and impact on the current program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the July 13 meeting, I pointed out the proposed 15% bright linetest for the permissible ``minor uses'' of fossil fuels would have theobvious effect of prohibiting the qualification of innovative solar energytechnology QFs, such as the LUZ projects. I am pleased that the NOPR hasbeen modified to acknowledge that problem and seek comment on the spectrumof other possibilities available to address the issue. Without prejudgingthe preferred option, I believe the Commission must balance carefully thedesire for administrative expediency in processing applications, on onehand, and the continued importance of pursuing available renewable resourcetechnologies for the near term and long range future, on the other. Inthe end, we must strike a responsible compromise between those two considerations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Before concluding, I want to note that the procedures for public commentwere modified at the July 27 Commission meeting to provide that the Commissioncould ask questions of witnesses at the public hearing and that they wouldbe allowed to answer orally, as well as in writing for the record. Whilethis may seem to be a small matter, the Commission over the last year hasrefused to allow witnesses at public hearings to provide oral responsesto Commissioner questions. As I have previously stated, that restrictionrendered the public hearings into a public farce and a gross embarrassmentto the Commission, to say nothing of the extreme and understandable frustrationexperienced by the muzzled witnesses. The whole approach, in my judgment,made a mockery of the intended due process aspect of the public hearingprocess, and prevented the Commission from having the open dialogue withwitnesses so essential to Commission and public understanding of theseissues. I am pleased that the modification was adopted and further thatit will be a precedent for all furture public hearings. It is time to endsuch due process excesses in our public comment procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In conclusion, I support the issuance of this NOPR for public comment.It appears that it has been developed in many respects as a companion tothe three pending electric NOPRs, as another step to mandate a competitiveelectric generating sector comprised of IPPs and QFs, and with the QF benefitsextended more broadly to IPPs. In some sense, this NOPR would narrow thegap between IPPs and QFs and make the QF program more comparable to andparallel with the IPP NOPR. At the same time, these PURPA implementationissues have deserved resolution since the public hearings in early 1987,irrespective of the other electric policy NOPRs. Consequently, the Commissionshould proceed to address them now while continuing the rulemaking proceedingin the other dockets. Subject to these several observations and reservationsnoted previously, I concur.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles A. Trabandt,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Commissioner.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="75">Public Hearings on RM88-4, RM88-5 and RM88-6 Opening Statement ofCommissioner Trabandt</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">July 21 and 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I want to join my colleagues in welcoming the large number of witnessesfor these two days of hearings on the electric policy Notices of ProposedRulemakings (NOPR) in Docket Nos. RM88-4, RM88-5 and RM88-6. These arevery important hearings, indeed, on the Commission's three interrelatedproposals in the areas of all source competitive bidding (ASCB), IndependentPower Producers (IPP) and administrative determination of avoided cost(ADFAC) under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), includingthe <T3>Orange and Rockland</T3> decision. At the outset, I would like to makesome brief observations for the benefit of the witnesses and other interestedparties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Secretary of Energy John Herrington last year stated that reformof electric power regulation must <T3>not</T3> be undertaken just for the sake of change. Rather, the objectiveof such reforms must be to make the system work <T3>better</T3>, not just to make it work <T3>differently</T3>. The public comments filed in these dockets and thepublic testimony today and tomorrow will provide the Commission with anassessment of whether these proposals, in fact, will make the current systemwork better or just differently. A quick-look review of the filed commentsindicates that the proposals clearly would <T3>not</T3> improve the system and, in all likelihood would make the systemwork much worse, as well as differently. In fact, the comments reflectvirtually no support for the particular ASCB proposal and indicate generallystrong opposition on the merits from all segments of industry, states andconsumers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I also want to highlight for the witnesses and other interested partiesthe comments of Senator J. Bennett Johnston, distinguished Chairman ofthe U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, at the confirmationhearing last week for Betsy Moler, who was nominated by President Reaganfor FERC Commissioner. Senator Johnston stated that it is premature toadopt these rulemakings at this time, for a number of reasons. First, becausethere are too many holes in the rulemakings, too many things that haven'tbeen thought out. It is in effect incomplete. Second, because Ms. Molerand any other new Commissioners ought to have a chance to take a look atthe rulemakings and be involved in the rulemakings and to have the timeto do so. He would hope that the Commission will slow down our processand not rush to judgment. He would regard that as a rush to judgment ifwe tried too quickly to enact these rules, because he thinks it's justpremature and they have not been thought out. Senator Johnston characterizedhis comments as a statement which he hoped will get over to FERC and concludedby saying, ``I hope that message gets over there.'' Senator Domenici concurredwith Chairman Johnston's view that these rulemakings ought to go slow.It is my belief that Chairman Johnston's comments reflect a bipartisanconsensus in the Senate. That fact should be of critical importance tothis Commission in deciding how to proceed with these NOPRs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Congressman Phil Sharp of Indiana, the distinguished Chairman of theEnergy and Power Subcommittee in the U.S. House of Representatives, commentedlast year about Federal-state responsibilities under PURPA, and he reiteratedthose remarks last month in a letter to FERC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">PURPA's evolution over the past ten years_both positive and negative_isin part the result of the division of authority between FERC and the statecommissions. That bifurcation is a proper exercise in both Federalism andenergy policy, and I urge FERC to remain sensitive to the key role thatthe state commissions play. The appropriate role for FERC must be to clarifyFederal law_where necessary_and to provide guidance with advice_where appropriate_(but)not to mandate any particular model or approach (for the states). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Again, a quick-look review of the filed comments indicates that theproposals are <T3>not</T3> sensitive at all to the key role that state commissions play.Quite the contrary, the proposals would mandate a particular model anda particular approach for every state. The proposals would have sweepingpreemptive effect, which would largely federalize state implementationof PURPA and preempt inconsistent state laws and actions in electric regulation.In particular, almost all existing state competitive programs would bestruck down under the proposals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Furthermore, closely related Commission action in June in the <T3>Orange and Rockland </T3>rehearing and in the decision in the Florida<T3>Industrial Cogenerators</T3> case have demonstrated beyond any reasonabledoubt that there really is only one way to proceed_<T3>and that is the FERC way. </T3>The procedural and substantive aspectsof those cases reflect a recurring FERC approach of unabashed Federal arroganceand inherent Federal superiority, with profound negative implications forthese electric NOPRs. In those cases, FERC established itself as an appealscourt for all state PURPA actions with a ``star chamber'' process. FERC,as a Federal ``Big Brother,'' has issued these Federal dictatorial fiatsas part of its concerted effort to federalize all implementation of PURPA<T3>and </T3> regulation of the generation sector of the electric industry.With the FERC way as the only way, FERC will virtually mandate the restructuringof the electric generation sector. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I have repeated many times over the past year the threshold issueof the need for these interrelated proposals. What is the real objective?What is broke that needs to be fixed? What is the problem FERC is attemptingto solve with these initiatives? The proposals argue that the ``regulatorycompact'' is broken irreversibly and must be replaced with ASCB and IPPin a newly competitive and independent generating sector to achieve theprimacy of economic efficiency and to ensure adequate supplies of electricpower in the future. The filed comments do not agree that the regulatorycompact is broken, nor that ASCB and IPP will improve efficiency or betterassure adequate supplies. To the contrary, the comments document decreasedefficiency and less assured supply, with serious potential reliabilityrisk, under these proposals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the real world of today, 28 or more states, including New York,New Jersey, Colorado and Washington most recently, have adopted, or arein the process of adopting, various forms of competitive processes forthe selection of new electric generation facilities. Similarly, a growingnumber of utilities are soliciting bids for new generation capacity, withmany thousands of megawatts already bid for several thousand megawattsof solicited capacity for utilities across the country. All of that stateand utility activity has proceeded thus far without one single new wordof regulations from FERC. And yet, those state competitive programs andutility solicitation programs, it appears, would be seriously threatened,if not wiped out completely, by these proposals for no apparent publicpolicy purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It also is quite apparent that the NOPRs inevitably will force a piecemealdecisionmaking process for Federal transmission policy contrary to theinterests of all segments of the electric industry. The far better, andlong overdue, approach to transmission reform is in a separate genericrulemaking specific to Federal transmission regulation. Otherwise, FERCwill inevitably fall into the tyranny of small decisions so thoroughlydiscredited by Dr. Alfred Kahn and many others. Without any particularor clear vision of a comprehensive and cohesive transmission policy, wewill make a series of discrete decisions, each one perhaps rational, whichwill add up to an irrational result. Even though each step will be conscious,the cumulative result will be largely inadvertent, because there is nota clear conception of what the ultimate outcome would or should be. Federaltransmission policy is far too important to allow the tyranny of smalldecisions to be the result. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In a general way, then, how should the Commission proceed with theproposals in the NOPRs in the face of the overwhelmingly negative publiccomments. I recommend that the witnesses, and those filing reply commentsin August, consider the following approach. First, the bidding NOPR wouldbecome the functional equivalent of a policy statement approving statecompetitive processes under PURPA with general guidelines and very few,if any, specific requirements. Second, the ADFAC NOPR would be scaled backdramatically to address only the need for power and capacity payments issue,with a few general guidelines. Third, the IPP NOPR would provide some modestrelief from current regulations, as in the January, 1988, <T3>Orange and Rockland</T3> IPP case. All transmission policy and Federalpreemptive effects would be removed from the three pending proposals asa result. And, fourth, FERC would develop and issue a NOPR addressing ona generic basis reform of Federal transmission regulation, <T3>before</T3> adopting final rules in the other three pending dockets.I believe this approach would be generally consistent with the majorityof public comments and urge its consideration by all parties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I look forward to all the testimony.
