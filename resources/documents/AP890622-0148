(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of civil rights activistsboarded buses Thursday to retrace the trail of the 1960s FreedomRiders and honor three slain volunteers. Many carried with them anew attitude about this southern state.   ``I'm leaving with an improved image of Mississippi,'' saidMinnie Sutton, 65, of New York. ``This state has made stridesforward although it looks like there's still a ways to go.''   Sutton was among 470 pilgrims who arrived in a caravan of 13buses from New York and Philadelphia, Pa., to attend ceremoniesWednesday in Philadelphia, Miss., honoring three civil rightsworkers who were slain 25 years ago.   More than 1,000 people went to a church once burned by the KuKlux Klan to hear veteran civil rights activists and state officialspay tribute to the work of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and MichaelSchwerner during a commemoration of their deaths on June 21, 1964.   On Thursday, 10 chartered buses left Meridian en route toWashington and additional ceremonies. The caravan, modeled on theNorth-to-South Freedom Rides of the 1960s, will end in New Yorklater in the week.   Several of those boarding the buses described thier trip as alearning experience and several agreed with Sutton that improvementshad occurred in Mississippi in the years since the killings.   Secretary of State Dick Molpus, a Philadelphia native who was 14at the time of the slayings, said the ceremony ``was good forMississippians and for people acorss this country.   ``We were able to send the message out very clearly that a newday has dawned here in our state and at the same time we had theopportunity to acknowledge a dark corner of our past, said Molpus,who offered an apology in remarks to Wednesday's ceremony.   ``Obviously, things aren't perfect in Mississippi but because ofthe turmoil of our past, there is a special racial sensitivity andwe hope that sensitivity can serve as a beacon for the rest of thenation,'' Molpus said.   ``We deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago,'' he said.``We wish we could undo it. Every decent person in Philadelphia andNeshoba County feels that way.''   The observance, in front of the Mount Zion Methodist Church,where Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner had been conducting a blackvoter registration meeting the night they were killed, showed that``Mississippi and America are far different places than they were 25years ago,'' Gov. Ray Mabus said.   After leaving the church, the three men were arrested on atraffic violation and taken to the Neshoba County Jail inPhiladelphia, 60 miles northeast of Jackson.   They disappeared after being released and an FBI investigationconcluded they were shot to death by members of the Ku Klux Klan.Their bodies were found 44 days later buried in an earthen dam.   Schwerner, 24, and Goodman, 20, were white volunteers from theNew York City area. Chaney was a 21-year-old black man from Meridian.</TEXT></DOC>
