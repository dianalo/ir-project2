 Nevertheless, in among the new maintenance and leasingoptions, and an array of programs already announced that IBM wants to adviseus are now ready to ship - on time, there was the odd noteworthy item, ledoff by a reminder that IBM is quite serious about artificial intelligence andexpert systems, and has both in-house and bought-in lines.andP;  The companyannounced Release 2.0 of its Expert System Environment with severalenhancements.andP;  The environment comprises an expert system shell, designed tosimplify the development and use of knowledge bases, and knowledge-basedapplications.andP;  IBM says that the new release will provide interaction betweenknowledge bases and IMS, CICS and MVS applications, and enable a knowledgebase developed in the environment to be consulted interactively in VM/CMS andMVS/TSO.andP;  In embedded Application Programming Interface, API, mode, Release2.0 also returns results from a consultation to the application in MVS/IMS,MVS/CICS, MVS/TSO and MVS/batch environments.andP;  Other new features include theability to merge separately developed knowledge bases, by allowing oneknowledge base to invoke another, and a MRI Machine Readable Informationmodule which enables national language expert system translation.andP;  The newrelease also provides translation of all standard text that may be displayedfor Japanese, and is enhanced to take advantage of MVS/XA.andP;  The company alsoannounced a Complete Expert System Consultation Environment, ESCE, which usesa re-entrant capability to make a single copy accessible to multiple users.andO;The Expert System Environment running under MVS costs $44,620 or $2,478 amonth, with prices for the Expert System Consultation Environment/MVS set at$7,875 or $436 respectively.andP;  For VM users, Expert System Environment one-offprices range from $22,300 on a Model 10 Processor Group to $57,570 on a Model50 Processor Group, and from $3,920 to $10,160 for the ConsultationEnvironment.andP;  Monthly charges are $2,478 and $436 respectively; it is due tobe available in June.andM;Second announcement in the artificial intelligence arena is IBM's version ofIntellicorp Inc's Knowledge Engineering Environment, KEE, modified to run inan MVS/XA environment with IBM Common Lisp for MVS.andP;  Described as aknowledge-based systems development tool, IBM says KEE offers artificialintelligence functions including a flexible frame language; inheritance;object-oriented programming; interactive graphics; and a range of reasoningand analytic tools.andP;  It also provides a graphics-oriented editing anddebugging environment, and features for integrating completed applicationswith other information systems.andP;  The IBM version is upwards-compatible withall versions of Intellicorp's KEE 3.1, and costs $98,000 or $4,900 a month.andO;The product is currently available on a controlled release basis in the USand general availability is promised for March 24.andM;VM users have not been forgottenandM;Following the new release of VM/XA which came out at Christmas (CI No 1,084),IBM now says it will be offering a VM Performance Reporting Facility, VMPRF,for VM/XA.andP;  Reports used to analyse and tune system performance will coverareas such as use of resources and machine channels, response time,throughput, and disk and tape activity.andP;  IBM says that VMPRF will beavailable in April for $5,500.andM;And there will also be a Maintenance Release 4 fo the VM/DirectoryMaintenance application that enables users to manage, maintain, and modifycontrol statements in a VM/SP, VM/SP HPO, or VM/XA SP directory.andP;  The newrelease promised significant performance improvements and usabilityenhancements, plus efficient and timely maintenance of the system directoryas the number of CMS users supported on a system increases by removing thearbitrary user ID limits - &quot;arbitrary&quot; is IBM's word!andP;  It costs a one-time$1,055 on a baby 9370 to $7,280 on a large 3090, $117 a month on all machinesizes, and IBM hopes to ship it in the US on March 31.andM;SNA and communications enhancementsandM;First in a series of communications announcements comes Version 3 of IBM'sTeleprocessing Network Simulator, TPNS.andP;  The program is used to testapplications, control programs, subsystems, and access methods, by simulatingnetwork resources and message traffic.andP;  Version 3 enhancements mean thatusers can execute a TPNS control program in a 3745 Communication Controller,and can connect to an IBM Token Ring network via the 9370 Token Ring Adaptor.andO;IBM also says V3 offers a number of new ease-of-use enhancements and greaterfunctional capabilities, including a new Structured Translator Language, STL,and a log compare utility.andP;  V3 prices range from $1,775 a month on a ModelGroup 20 large 9370, to $2,375 on a Model Group 50 3090-500 or 600; one timecharges are $112,320 to $171,000; it is available in the US in July.andM;IBM also chose last week to announce VM support for Version 1 Release 2 andVersion 2 of its X.5 Interconnection program, XI, for Systems NetworkArchitecture networks.andP;  The former operates in the 3725 running AdvancedCommunication Function/Network Control Program, ACF/NCP Version 4 Release 3,the latter in the 3270 and 3745 running ACF/NCP Version 5 Release 2.andP;  Bothprograms are for VM/XA or VM/SP with or without the High Performance Option,HPO.andP;  Both versions should be available in May.andP;  VM support is also extended,via Release 2, to IBM's X25 Interconnection program resource manager, the X25SNA Network Supervisory Function, NSF.andP;  It runs on MVS, MVS/XA, VM/SP, orVM/XA hosts as a subtask of NetView, and is designed to collect X25 trafficand accounting information.andP;  IBM says Release 2 will support existing XIversions and releases, and should be available in May.andP;  Onetime charges startat $3,780 on a Model Group 10, and reach $26,010 for Model Group 50.andP;  Themonthly licence option costs $420, regardless of the size of the user'smachine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
