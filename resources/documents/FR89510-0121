No. 34-26783; File No. SR-NSCC-89-02] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation;Order Approving Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>On February 8, 1989, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'')filed with the Commission a proposed rule change under section 19(b) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). As discussed in detail below,the proposal provides for accelerated comparison of securities transactions.Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 8, 1989, to solicit comments from interestedpersons.\1\<NOTE/> No comments were received.\2\<NOTE/> This order approves the proposal. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26585 (March 1, 1989);54 FR 9958. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ As discussed below, however, one comment letter was receivedby NSCC in response to a pre-filing notice to its broker-dealer participants. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description of the Proposal </ITAG>The proposed rule change consists of fundamental modifications to SectionII (captioned ``Trade Comparison Service'') of NSCC's Procedures.\3\<NOTE/> In general, the proposal would shorten the comparison cyclefor all regular-way,\4\<NOTE/> non-systematized trades.\5\<NOTE/> It would implement an initial match routine on the nightof trade date and move up the trade resolution process by one day.\6\<NOTE/> The NSCC states in its filing that the proposal would applyto transactions in equity securities (<T3>i.e., </T3>stocks, rights, and warrants) \7\<NOTE/> executed over-the-counter (``OTC'') and on national securitiesexchanges other than the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'').\8\<NOTE/> The NSCC notes that it also has other procedures under developmentthat would shorten the comparison time frames for transactions executedon the NYSE.\9\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Trade comparison, or the matching of the buy and sellsides of a securities transaction, is the process after a trade has beenexecuted by which broker-dealers confirm with each other the trade's terms(<T3>e.g., </T3>security, number of units, and price) and the existenceof a contract. This process results in a compared trade. Comparison isthe first of the three basic steps in processing a securities transaction(the other two being clearance and settlement). <T3>See </T3>Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break, </T3>Ch. 10 at 2-4 (hereinafter <T3>Division Report</T3>); NSCC Procedures, Sect. II.A.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ A ``regular-way'' transaction means settlement on T+5,the ordinary time-frame for settlement of transactions in stocks, rights,and warrants, and certain other securities. <T3>See </T3>D. Scott, <T3>Wall Street Words </T3>291 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ A ``systematized'' or ``locked-in'' trade refers to atrade in an automated system. Under the locked-in comparison method, theentity (<T3>e.g., </T3>the exchange) that operates the system becomes the contra-sideto each half of the trade. A ``non-systematized'' trade refers to the traditionaltwo-sided comparison method where trade input data come from the buyingand selling brokers to the clearing agency. <T3>See Division Report, supra </T3>note 3, at 10-3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The NSCC notes that acceleration of its comparison cycleis being developed in conjunction with the Automated Confirmation TransactionSystem (``ACT''), currently under development by the National Associationof Securities Dealers. <T3>See </T3>NSCC Important Notice A3097, dated November 16, 1988, whichappears as <T3>Exhibit C </T3>in the instant file. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The Commission notes that the NSCC's use of the term ``equitysecurities'' to mean stocks, rights, and warrants is for the purposes ofthis rule proposal and does not constitute a definition of the term. <T3>See </T3>Section 3(a)(11) of the Act. <T3>See also </T3>M. Thomsett, <T3>Investment andamp; Securities Dictionary </T3>99 (1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Stated positively, the proposal would apply to equitytransactions executed in the OTC market and on the following securitiesexchanges: the American Stock Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, theCincinnati Stock Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange, the Pacific StockExchange, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (<T3>i.e., </T3>all United States securities exchanges except the ChicagoBoard Options Exchange, the Spokane Stock Exchange, and, as stated in theproposal, the New York Stock Exchange). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ In this connection, the NSCC and the NYSE currently areengaged in a cooperative effort to reduce the comparison cycle for equitytransactions executed on the NYSE from T+5 to T+1. That effort is independentof the instant proposal. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, Securities ExchangeAct Release No. 26627 (March 14, 1989), 54 FR 11470 [File No. SR-NYSE-88-36];Notice of Proposed Rule Change, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26742(April 18, 1989), 54 FR 18063 [File No. SR-NSCC-89-04]. Specifically, the proposal provides that NSCC clearing members must submitall non-systematized transactions to NSCC no later than 2:00 a.m. on theday after the trade date (<T3>i.e., </T3>on ``T+1''), which is a proposed acceleration of 11 hours(from 1:00 p.m. on T+1). Clearing members could delete trades only until2:00 a.m., a proposed acceleration of 13 hours (from 3:00 p.m. on T+1).The NSCC would be required to produce regularway contract lists by 7:00a.m. on T+1, a proposed acceleration of 25 hours.\10\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ NSCC's ``clearing member reports'' (also known as ``contractsheets'' and ``contract lists'') list: (1) Compared trades, (2) uncomparedtrades, and (3) advisory trades. Uncompared trades are trades by a clearingmember that have not been matched. Advisory trades are trades submittedby the contra-side, against the member, that have not been matched. <T3>See </T3>NSCC Procedures, Sect. II.B.; <T3>Division Report, supra </T3>note 3, at 3.Moreover, under the proposal, clearing members, upon receiving their contractlists on T+I, would have until 2:00 p.m. on T+I to submit adjustments,a proposed acceleration of 24 hours (from 2:00 p.m. on T+2). NSCC wouldbe required to issue the corresponding output by 7:00 a.m. on T+2. Thereafter,clearing members could submit adjusting information to NSCC, generatingcorresponding output, until the final comparison output on T+3. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Rationale </ITAG>The NSCC states in its filing that the proposal, by shortening the comparisoncycle, would: (1) Increase the efficiency of the post trade comparisonprocess, and (2) shorten the length of time that investors and NSCC clearingmembers are exposed to the risk of market fluctuations on uncompared trades.The NSCC states that, consequently, as required in section 17A(b)(3)(F)of the Act, the proposal would protect investors and the public interest.Further, the NSCC states that, as required in section 17A(b)(3)(F), theproposal, by shortening the comparison cycle, would help promote just andequitable principles of trade and foster cooperation and coordination withpersons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing informationwith respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion </ITAG>The Commission believes that this proposal is consistent with the Act.The proposal, by shortening the comparison cycle for OTC and non-NYSE exchangetrades, would reduce the risk exposure to investors and to NSCC clearingmembers as well as contribute to the prompt and efficient clearance andsettlement of securities transactions. The NSCC's proposal marks the first major overhaul to its comparison systemsince the 1970s. Moreover, this proposal constitutes only one phase ofthe contemplated redesign of the NSCC's comparison operations, with relatedefforts that involve the NYSE.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ <T3>See, supra</T3>, note 9. The Commission notes, as a general matter, that the goal of prompt andefficient clearance and settlement of securities transactions (includingthe comparison of securities transactions) and the use of automated systemsin pursuit of this goal are expressly contemplated in section 17A(a)(1)of the Act. Congress stated in that provision that inefficient proceduresfor the clearance and settlement of securities transactions impose unnecessaryrisks and costs on investors and that prompt and accurate clearance andsettlement are necessary for investor protection. Congress further stated in sections 6(b)(5), 15A(b)(6), and 17A(b)(3)(F)that the rules of exchanges, securities associations, and clearing agencies,respectively, should be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions. Moreover, in section 17A(a)(2)of the Act, Congress directed the Commission to use   its authority tofacilitate a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance andsettlement of securities transactions. The risks posed by uncompared trades came under intense scrutiny followingthe Market Break of October 1987.\12\<NOTE/> During the Market Break, uncompared trades on all securitiesmarkets (including the exchanges and the OTC market) increased substantiallyand, for several reasons, became a major stress point in the clearanceand settlement process. First, uncompared trades required special labor-intensivetreatment (``exception processing'') under working conditions already renderedchaotic by record trading volume.\13\<NOTE/> Second, the rate of uncompared trades did not remain at itsusual   percentage of trading volume, but as trading volume increased to2\1/2\ times normal levels during the week of October 19-23, uncomparedtrades doubled as a percentage of total trades.\14\<NOTE/> And, third, the record market volatility (primarily downward)threatened to impose financial penalties on those firms that could notresolve trade comparison errors quickly, or at any rate before settlementwith their customers on T+5.\15\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>See, e.g., Division Report, supra </T3>note 3, Ch. 10 at 5-13; <T3>Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms </T3>51-52,Study VI at 48-49 (January 8, 1988) (hereinafter the <T3>Brady Report</T3>); <T3>Interim Report of the Working Group on Financial Markets</T3>, AppendixD at 6 (May 1988) (hereinafter <T3>Working Group Report</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See Division Report</T3>, Ch. 10 at 5. During the Market Break, theexchanges, NASD, and NSCC took unusual steps to resolve uncompared trades.During the week of October 19, 1987, the NYSE required its member organizationsand specialists to meet in the morning before trading opened, in the eveningafter trading closed, and on weekends to resolve uncompared trades. TheNASD operated its Trade Acceptance and Resolution System, or TARS, from10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 23 to resolve uncompared trades.The NSCC extended its 6:00 p.m. deadline to as late as 1:00 a.m. for itsclearing members to report the resolution of unmatched trades, and theNSCC was open on Saturday, October 23 to receive reports of compared tradesfor processing on the following Monday. Additionally, from October 23 to30, all of the exchanges and NASDAQ closed trading two hours early to allowfirms to catch up on their back office work. <T3>See id. </T3>at 10-9. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ For OTC executions during the week of October 19, 1987,T+2 uncompared trades processed by two-sided comparison increased froman average rate of 5.6% to 10.6%. <T3>See  Division Report</T3>, Ch. 10 at 8. <ITAG tagnum="28">For OTC executions on October 19 and 20, T+2 uncompared trades fortwo-sided input increased from an average of 5.6% to 22.3% and I1.5%, respectively.In arithmetic terms, however, uncompared trades on T+2 increased from adaily average of 6,200 to 27,685 and 27,035 for executions on October l9and October 20, respectively. </ITAG><T3>See id.</T3>, Table 10-2 at Ch. 10, p. 60. <T3>See a1so Brady Report</T3>, Study IV at 48. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See Division Report</T3>, Ch. 10 at 5-6. In terms of price volatility,on Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA'')closing value had declined a record 508.32 points (22.6%, also a record)from its previous close, <T3>i.e</T3>., from 2246.74 to 1738.41. After two more daily reversalsof over 100 points, the DJIA closed out the week on Friday, October 23,1987, at 1950.76, a net 5-day decline (from Friday, October 16) of 295.98points (13.2%). <T3>See id.</T3>, Appendix D at Tables 2 and 3.Based on the experience of October I987, with its unprecedented tradingvolume and price volatility, the Commission concluded that, among otherthings, efficient markets will require same-day, floor-derived trade comparison.\16\<NOTE/> Thus, the NSCC's proposal (which will shrink the comparisoncycle from T+2 to T+1), while it does not meet the Commission's final objectiveof same-day comparison, is consistent with the Commission's desire to shortenthe comparison cycle. The NSCC's proposal likewise is consistent with the<T3>Workinq Group Report,</T3> which concluded that the development ofon-line trade matching systems would enhance the capacity of market participantsto monitor their intra-day exposure.\17\<NOTE/> The proposal also is consistent with the intermarket clearingand credit mechanisms espoused by the <T3>Brady Report</T3> to reduce market exposure to clearing corporations.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ See Securities and Exchange Commission Recommendationsregarding the October 1987 Market Break, contained in Testimony deliveredby David S. Ruder, Chairman, SEC, before the Senate Committee on Banking,Housing and Urban Affairs, 23-24 (February 3, 1988). <T3>See also Division Report. </T3>Ch. 10 at 12; <T3>Working Group Report, </T3>Appendix D at 6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>The Working Group Report </T3>called for same-day, floor-derived comparisonof securities transactions. <T3>See Working Group Report,</T3> Appendix D at 6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>See Brady Report </T3>at 64-65. The Commission favors the efforts of this proposal to reduce the lengthof the comparison cycle. The Commission also expects that the NASD andNSCC will consider its proposed comparison system not to be a final goalbut only a near-term phase in its efforts toward the development and implementationof a same-day comparison system.\19\<NOTE/> In this regard, the Commission notes that clearing membersrely on NSCC's two sided comparison system to process the majority of theirOTC trades in corporate equity securities.\20\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ The Commission's staff has met with the NSCC's staffand the staffs of securities markets and has discussed the technical andother problems associated with a change to a same-day comparison system.The Commission is cognizant of the various concerns, including: (1) Theneed for further systems development; (2) the competing demands for space,as on a trading floor; (3) the possible need for expanded clerical staffs;(4) the potential disruptions to operations during the phasing-in period;and (5) the financial cost of the undertaking. <ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission also notes that several regional exchanges (</ITAG><T3>e.q., </T3>the Options Floor of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange) alreadyhave floor-derived comparison systems in operation on their trading floors.With these systems, all trades are matched on the floor at the time ofexecution. Such automated systems, by locking-in the trade data in thismanner, can almost totally eliminate uncompared trades. <T3>See Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10, note 1 at 2.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ In an effort to streamline comparison and clearance ofOTC trades, the NASD is developing the Automated Confirmation TransactionSystem (``ACT''). <T3>See, supra,</T3> note 6. ACT is being designed to lock-in the termsof OTC trades among market makers for submission to the NMS high-speedticker and to NSCC for clearance and settlement. ACT, a trade confirmationand reporting facility (which will not be designed as a trade executionfacility), will apply to conventionally-handled OTC trades that are negotiatedby telephone (as distinct from trades executed in automated systems). Aftera trade has been negotiated, the parties (<T3>i.e., </T3>the market maker side and the order entry side) will entertrade data for automatic matching or display on the contra party's terminal.When all elements of a trade have been entered into the system and match,the trade will be treated as locked-in and forwarded automatically to theNSCC. The NASD plans to begin testing ACT in June 1989. The Commissionnotes that before ACT can be implemented, it will have to be filed withthe Commission as a rule proposal under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. While the Commission has received no comments in response to its noticeof this proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the NSCC reported in its filing that it hadreceived one comment letter in response to its November 16, 1988 ImportantNotice. The commentator, Pershing Division of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corporation (``Pershing''), an NSCC clearing member, statedthat under present comparison rules it is able to review trades from introducingbrokers prior to their input to NSCC and to delete such infrequent tradesas fail to meet its standards, but that, under the accelerated comparisoncycle, it will lack the time to make an informed review,\21\<NOTE/> and that, accordingly, it will have to delete a large numberof trades based on general standards rather than an informed review.\22\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ A clearing member's opportunity to delete the tradesof its introducing firms would be reduced by the proposal from 3:00 p.m.on T+1 to 2:00 a.m. on T+1, <T3>i.e., </T3>by 13 hours. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Joseph D. Donnelly, Senior Vice President, PershingDivision of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corporation, toNSCC, dated November 29, 1988. A copy of this letter is included in NSCC'srule proposal as <T3>Exhibit D.</T3>Consequently, the commentator requested an accommodation from the NSCCwhereby, when the comparison process is accelerated, any party whose nameis given up for clearance by another party would continue to have the unilateralopportunity to delete any transaction until 3:00 p.m. on T+1.\23\<NOTE/> In response, the NSCC noted, among other things, clearingmembers are obligated for trades of the firms to whom they provide clearanceservices and concluded that, it would not be appropriate for NSCC to offersuch firms a unilateral T+1 delete capability.\24\<NOTE/> Moreover, NSCC has reported that the proposed accelerationof trade data submission will not otherwise burden clearing members becausemost NSCC clearing members voluntarily submit OTC trade data for comparisonwithin the proposed earlier trade data submission time frame on T+1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ The term ``give-up'' in this context describes a broker'sacting in behalf of another broker, as where an introducing broker in placingan order ``gives up'' the name of a clearing broker, indicating that itis acting on that firm's behalf. <T3>See</T3> M. Thomsett,<T3> Investment andamp; Securities Dictionary</T3> 120 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Karen L. Saperstein, Vice President and AssociateGeneral Counsel, NSCC, to Joseph D. Donnelly, Senior Vice President andGeneral Counsel, Pershing Division of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corporation, dated March 16, 1989. The Commission recognizes that the NSCC's OTC trade comparison process,in order to operate smoothly, requires cooperation from many differentparties, including: Market  makers, clerical staff, clearing members, servicebureaus, the staff of NASDAQ and the NSCC. The Commission believes thatshortening the OTC trade comparison cycle will provide improved efficienciesin clearance and settlement of these trades and will reduce clearing agency,clearing member and investor risks because firms will know their tradingpositions and market exposures on a timely basis. The Commission believes that clearing firms must maintain appropriate riskcontrol mechanisms and recognizes that clearing firms are reviewing theadequacy of those control mechanisms. For example, the Commission understandsthat (1) some clearing firms have been developing new credit systems withregard to introducing firms that will provide clearing firms with betterfinancial controls, and (2) the NASD is developing a risk management modulefor use with ACT that would allow clearing firms to establish, on an automatedbasis, preset credit limits for their introducing firms. Although the Commission believes it is appropriate for clearing firms todevelop rigorous risk control mechanisms, the Commission does not believeit would be appropriate to require NSCC to provide clearing firms an extendedopportunity to delete the trades of introducing firms. The Commission believesthat certainty and finality of trades is critical to the efficient operationof the OTC market. Indeed, the Commission is concerned that the assertedauthority of clearing firms to dishonor trades, if exercised, could substantiallyreduce market confidence in market makers who are introducing firms. Accordingly,the Commission believes that providing a more extended opportunity forclearing firms to exercise their asserted authority to delete trades until3:00 p.m. on T+1, a full day after their execution, would raise doubtsabout the finality of trades with non-clearing firm market makers and thegeneral reliability of the clearance and settlement system. The Commissionalso does not believe that NSCC's rule proposal imposes improper burdenson clearing firms, particularly in light of the increased efficiency andreduced risks obtained from earlier trade comparison. To summarize, the proposed rule change, by shortening the NSCC's comparisoncycle, would make the NSCC's comparison procedures: (1) Safer with regardto the risks of market price volatility, and (2) more efficient in termsof the time and expense involved in trade processing. Further, the proposalwould help protect investors and other persons that safeguard investors'funds and facilitate their transactions. Moreover, the Commission believesthat the proposal is consistent with the Act, particularly sections 6(b)(5),15A(b)(6), and 17A of the Act, and that it warrants approval. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed in this order, the Commission finds that theproposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulationsthereunder. <T3>It is Therefore Ordered,</T3> pursuant to section 19(b) of the Actthat the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-89-02)be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 4, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
