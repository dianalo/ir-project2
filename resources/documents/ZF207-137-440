Heights, Framingham, Mass.andO;01701 (508) 875-6553.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Fred Cagle, president of Integrated Micro Medical Systems Inc. of San Diego,is developing a medical-records system for the Veterans Administration.andO;''With medical records, you get so much information that no one wants to lookat it,'' he said.andP;  ''We needed some way to simplify it, and hypertext seemedthe way to go.andM;''HyperBase handles ASCII standard files, so documents could be used infuture systems.andP;  The Prolog language was a nice extra,'' he added.andM;HypertiesandM;Cognetics Corp.andM;Hyperties grew out of research at the University of Maryland's Human-ComputerInteraction Laboratory.andP;  Marketing and continued development is handled byCognetics, a firm that specializes in human/ computer interfaces.andM;Hyperties imposes a standard interface on all its applications.andP;  A menu atthe bottom of the screen allows users to go to the next or previous page orreturn to a previous article.andP;  Automatically generated path histories listall the articles a reader visited in a session.andP;  Readers can search forarticles containing specific words.andM;Hyperties support for authors is thoughtful.andP;  Indexes are createdautomatically but can be edited.andP;  Although Hyperties can be used to authordocuments that include both text and graphics, no built-in facility isprovided for linking to parts of a graphic image.andM;Hyperties supports all levels of IBM graphics, from ASCII through VideoGraphics Array (VGA).andP;  The $349 version includes the right to distribute 20copies of a Hyperties database.andP;  Another version supports Microtouch and IBMInfowindow touch screens, and videodisk.andM;Cognetics Corp. can be reached at 55 Princeton-Hightstown Road, PrincetonJunction, N.J.andP;  08550 (609) 799-5005.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Bill Fraser, associate director of R and D for specialty chemicals at UnionCarbide Corp. in Tarrytown, N.Y., used hypertext to train personnel aboutsafety.andP;  ''Procedures change over time.andP;  With a paper manual, it is difficultto keep track of what is different,'' he said.andP;  ''I like the way Hypertieslets you look at information from several different points of view.''andM;Bernard Rous, associate director of publications for the Communications ofthe ACM, the main publication of the Association for Computing Machinery,oversaw the special July 1988 issue on Hypertext.andM;''The Hyperties version includes more material and does a nice job ofproviding short, chunky articles that lend themselves well to a computerscreen,'' he said.andP;  ''I find the user interface for Hyperties really easy toget around.andP;  This is not surprising when you understand that it evolved outof a human-interface lab.''andM;IBM LinkWayandM;IBM Educational SystemsandM;LinkWay is a mouse-driven, graphics-based hypertext-authoring system targetedat the educational market.andP;  It supports all IBM graphics modes.andP;  Included isa memory-resident program that can capture screens produced by any standardpaint program.andP;  Buttons can be overlaid on top of these graphics screens.andP;  Inmost cases, if a reader can read the document, he can also edit it to suithis needs.andM;LinkWay supports videodisks, local area networks (LANs), digitizers and voiceboards.andM;A single copy costs $110.andP;  License to copy the program 12 times costs $495,and the LAN version costs $660.andM;IBM Educational Systems can be reached at P.O.andP;  Box 2150, Atlanta, Ga.andP;  30055(404) 238-3245.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Kerry Johnson, director of information services and educational technology atthe Sacramento City Unified School District, has been beta-testing LinkWaysince August (LinkWay was released in January).andM;''I use it to do demonstrations and to create my presentations,'' she said.andO;''We interface a PS/2 to large 65-inch SuperVHS displays.andP;  We have about 40MS-DOS networks that all use a Novell [Inc.] network manager and IBM's ICLASSInstructional Manager.andP;  A teacher can put any activity on the network andassign any lesson to any child.andM;''I wanted 256 colors and wanted to digitize video.andP;  In my presentations, Iuse digitized video images, usually pictures of kids.andP;  I put text or textboxes over the video with LinkWay.''andM;KnowledgeProandM;Knowledge Garden Inc.andM;KnowledgePro blends an expert-system shell with a hypertext-developmentsystem.andP;  The documents that result are more structured than orthodoxhypertext and easier to use than other expert systems.andM;KnowledgePro applications certainly look like hypertext.andP;  Point to a wordhighlighted on-screen, and a link takes you to a related screen.andP;  These linksdiffer from most hypertext-development systems: KnowledgePro comes with abuilt-in programming language.andP;  This allows much more intelligence to bebuilt into an application than is usually possible.andP;  What is lost is freedomfor the user to make his own decisions.andM;The $495 KnowledgePro development system supports keyboard and mouseselection of menus and hypertext linkages.andP;  The run-time version can becopied and distributed royalty-free.andM;An $89 Graphics Toolkit supports PCX images drawn in Enhanced GraphicsAdapter (EGA) mode and is a tool for overlaying buttons on graphics.andP;  A $40Database Toolkit provides access to dBASE III and Lotus 1-2-3 files.andP;  A $249VideoDisk Toolkit supports the Sony LDP player.andM;PC Week was unable to locate users.andM;Knowledge Garden Inc. can be reached at 473A Malden Bridge Road, RD 2,Nassau, N.Y.andP;  12123 (518) 766-3000.andM;Houdini, MaxThink,andM;HyperLink MaxThinkandM;MaxThink Inc.andM;MaxThink's interrelated hypertext-development tools may be less slick thanother offerings, but collectively provide a great deal of power.andM;All MaxThink products are text-based and keyboard-driven.andP;  Support forgraphics and mice is minimal.andP;  Links can be made to call up graphics, butimages and text cannot be merged, nor are buttons easily overlaid overgraphics.andM;At the low end is a shareware product called HyperRez.andP;  This memory-residentsystem is best-suited for authoring small hypertext applications with fewerthan 100 links.andM;The next level up is the $89 TransText combination word processor/hypertexteditor.andM;The $89 Houdini 3.0 system processor is the principal tool for buildingcomplex hypertext networks.andP;  It is used to index files (nodes), constructcross-references, find common node groups and polish the final appearance ofthe hypertext system.andM;The $6 PC-Hypertext program acts as a run-time system that allows existingMaxThink documents to be distributed royalty-free.andP;  Other MaxThink add-onsare tools for managing and editing complex hypertext environments.andM;MaxThink Inc. can be reached at at 44 Rincon Road, Kensington, Calif.andP;  94707(415) 428-0104.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Bruce Winters, national senior manager of R and D at Touche-Ross in New York,is building an accounting and auditing knowledge base using Houdini.andP;  ''Onereason we picked Houdini is that it stores files individually,'' he said.andO;''Because the files are saved as small ASCII files, we can remove a file oredit it with any word processor.andP;  The editing tools are extremely powerfuland take awhile to master.andM;''Our biggest problem is getting the information in electronic form.andO;Maintenance is definitely an issue.andP;  Experts have to maintain the database.''andM;Guide ReviewandM;Owl International Inc.andM;Guide is an interactive tool for creating and reading hypertext documentsthat can include any mixture of text, graphics, audio and video.andP;  The programis offered in Macintosh and IBM Windows versions.andM;Guide is very graphically oriented.andP;  A mouse is required, as is a graphicscard for the PC version.andP;  The Guide author is free to create applicationsthat place any mixture of text and graphics in multiple windows on a singlescreen.andM;Guide provides editors with a great deal of freedom, which requires excellentorganizational skills on their part.andP;  Although the program neither generatesnor requires indexes, tables of contents or other standard interfacetechniques, editors are free to incorporate such devices into their designs.andM;For PC users, Guide 2.0, running under Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 2.0 (arun-time version is included) lists for $275.andP;  The IBM PC version is $300;the Mac version is $199.95.andM;Owl International Inc. can be reached at 14218 N.E.andP;  21st St., Bellevue,Wash.andP;  98007 (206) 747-3203.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Bob Wallace is a vice president and technical director of HyperView SystemsCorp., of Middletown, R.I., which generates technical manuals in hypertextfor military, regulatory and legal markets.andP;  ''We looked for a product withan open architecture that could support extensions.andP;  The extensions wecreated for Guide provide it with the multimedia abilities we need,'' saidWallace.andP;  ''For example, we use VideoWorks on the Mac to provide animation.andO;Audio and support for videodisk players were also easily incorporated.andP;  WithGuide, the amount of training our production people needed to buildapplications is very minimal.andP;  But as easy as Guide is to use, it takes fourto six months to train employees to handle some of the design issues.''andM;Window Book ReviewandM;Window Book Inc.andM;As its $50,000 price tag indicates, Window Book Review is designed forcompanies planning to employ a staff of a dozen or so hypertext authorswriting applications for thousands of readers.andM;Hypertext documents generated by Window Book can be run under DOS, Unix andOS/2.andP;  Products created under Window Book can be distributed license-free.andO;Window Book's strength is text; graphics and fancy fonts are not supported asfully as on other hypergenerators.andM;Window Book enforces a very simple standardized interface centered around themetaphor of a book.andP;  Its authoring system generates tables of contents andindexes automatically, then allows those items to be messaged manually.andM;Window Book Inc. is at 61 Howard St., Cambridge, Mass.andP;  02139 (617) 661-9515.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Neil Duane, president of Boston Documentation Design Inc., ahypertext-publishing firm in Newton, Mass., likes Window Book's metaphor.andO;''We think the most effective systems use a book metaphor -- i.e., table ofcontents, alphabetical index and extensively cross-referenced pages,'' hesaid.andP;  ''Key-word search capability is a plus, but not a necessity in mostcases.andM;''The book metaphor is important because we do not want to impose the burdenof learning yet another skill on users.andP;  In the PC world, people just want tofind information quickly.andP;  People take to Window Book's book interfaceimmediately.andM;''Window Book's compaction scheme is a big advantage,'' Duane continued.andO;''It allows us to get the average manual onto one or two diskettes.andP;  Cuttingdown the number of disks results in considerable savings for clients whobundle disk-based manuals with their laptop computers.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
