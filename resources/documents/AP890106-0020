The suit contends that the regulations contain inadequatesafeguards to prevent violations of laws governing minimum wage,child labor, maximum work hours, workplace safety and other issues.   It also attacks the department's record of enforcing regulationscovering homework in the knitted outerwear industry _ which has beenlegal for the past four years _ and asks that the government beordered to consider reinstating the ban in that field.   Labor Department officials said they had not seen the suit andtherefore could not comment on most aspects. But they rejected itscharacterization of enforcement of labor laws in the knitted outwearindustry.   ``It's just not true that the department cannot enforce the FairLabor Standards Act in a homework environment,'' said Alan McMillan,a deputy assistant secretary. ``We absolutely feel that we can.''   McMillan said the four-year experience monitoring homework in theknitted outerwear industry had prompted the department to strengthenits enforcement procedures and include the improvements in the newregulations.   The five manufacturing industries covered by the new rules are:gloves and mittens, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs, embroideriesand, to a limited extent, jewelry.   Much of the women's apparel industry is not affected. But theLabor Department last week said it was considering drafting proposedrules for lifting the broader homework ban, too, and the outcome ofthe suit could signal whether organized labor will be successful inblocking that attempt.   About 167,000 workers are employed by the five affectedindustries, which generated $10 billion worth of production in 1986,said Susan Cowell, vice president of the ILGWU.   Joining the garment workers' union in filing the suit were twoother national unions, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile WorkersUnion and the Service Employees International Union; two NewYork-based union locals; three apparel-industry employerassociations representing 255 companies; and the states of New Yorkand Pennsylvania, where homework is banned by state law.   ``Industrial homework has always been a way to violate labor lawwith near impunity,'' New York Attorney General Robert Abrams saidin a statement. ``Homework can never be adequately regulated.''   Named as defendants were Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, andPaula V. Smith, administrator of the department's wage and hourdivision, which enforces many of the laws the suit contends would beviolated if the homework regulations were allowed to take effect.   Prohibitions on apparel industry homework were adopted in the1940s to combat exploitation of immigrants and other low-wageworkers. Lifting the bans has been the Reagan administration's topderegulatory effort in the labor relations area for the past severalyears. President-elect Bush has backed the efforts and is expectedto continue the deregulatory push.</TEXT></DOC>
