Rounding out the list of the top 11 are Italy, WestGermany, Czechoslovakia, Spain, Brazil and South Korea.   The report, which charts arms agreements with the Third Worldfrom 1980 to 1987, found that the Soviets had increased their shareof the Latin American arms agreements by 10 percent over the pastthree years.   In 1987, arms agreements with the Third World amounted to $30billion _ the lowest since the peak 1980 total of $60.5 billion,according to the report.   From 1980 to 1987, the value of all Third World arms contractswas $306.8 billion, with the Near East and South Asia accountingfor more than 67 percent.   U.S. arms sales agreement with the Third World rose to $5.6billion in 1987, from $4.1 billion in 1986, constituting 18.5percent of the total.   Soviet agreements, which constituted 48.5 percent of the totalfor the period, fell slightly in 1987 to $14.6 billion, the reportsaid.   Iran and Iraq, who have been at war with each other for 7{years, accounted for 20.9 percent _ or $64.1 billion _ of all ThirdWorld arms agreements from 1980 to 1987, according to the study.   The Soviets supplied 29 percent of the combatants' arms, andChina accounted for 13 percent. The share of all Europeannon-communist countries in agreements with Iran and Iraq was 31percent, the study said.   Iran's largest supply source was all communists states excludingthe Soviet Union. They accounted for 31 percent of the total. Chinawas Iran's second-largest supply source with 21 percent.   The Soviets were Iraq's single biggest supply source with 37percent of the total, and China's share was 10 percent, accordingto the study.

Of the Soviets' nearly$8.2 billion in 1984-1987 arms agreements with Latin America, 70percent were with Cuba.
