But now, the millions who have gone west are causingmany others to go to the polls.   Across the state, and particularly in Southern California, votersare being asked to put the brakes on growth, at least until theroads, sewers and water supplies can catch up.   In last November's local elections in California, 15 of 17 ballotmeasures aimed at limiting growth won approval.   On Tuesday, voters in Orange County, Seal Beach, San Clemente,Manhattan Beach, Pasadena, Hemet and San Marcos are being asked toadopt growth-related initiatives. In rapidly developing northern andwestern Los Angeles County, Supervisor Mike Antonovich is beingchallenged by candidates who say he has allowed developers to makelives miserable.   And more such challenges and slow-growth measures are in storefor November.   ``What we have is an authentic grass-roots movement,'' said BobBuster, who co-wrote a successful 1979 Riverside growth initiativeand who supports a new Riverside County measure.   ``We think it's time to fight back,'' he said.   The movement started to gather steam in 1986, when Los Angelesvoters chose Proposition U as a means to slow growth by cuttinghousing densities in some areas. Also that year, San Franciscovoters passed Measure M, slashing office construction in half for upto 10 years.   Worries about rapid growth are especially severe in SouthernCalifornia, where the 13.1 million residents of the six-countyregion are expected to be joined by 5 million others by the year2010, an amount equal to the population of Indiana.   In Riverside County, the 4-year-old city of Moreno Valley, apatchwork of housing tracts and shopping centers, is often cited asan example of growth gone awry. In 10 years, its population hastripled to near 90,000.   Flood control in some areas consists of crude ditches and sandbags. Many schools are surrounded by trailer classrooms, laid likedominos to hold a student population that has more than doubled infour years.   The story is the same in school districts throughout the state _wherever populations are expanding.   ``We are being packed in like sardines,'' complains GeraldSilver, 55, a San Fernando Valley no-growth activist.   Studies have predicted that by 2010 the average SouthernCalifornia freeway commuter can expect to limp to work at 11 mphunless roadways are improved.   Already, pollution levels fail to meet federal clean airregulations, and for the last two years drought-like conditions havestirred concerns about future water supplies.   ``It's like the lifeboat that says 65 (capacity),'' says BillCunningham, a slow-growth advocate on the Redlands City Council.``The 66th guy steps in. They all drown.''   Critics say the growth-control measures will mean even higherhousing costs for California, where the average home price tops$152,000.   A study by the Center for Economic Research at Chapman College inOrange found the Orange County slow-growth initiative would cost thecounty nearly $270 million in lost sales tax by 1997, and in thatperiod, 100,000 jobs would vanish.   The initiative, Measure A on Tuesday's ballot, would limit growthoutside city jurisdictions, depending on the impact that growthwould have on roads, emergency services, flood control and parklands.   Identical measures are on the ballot in the Orange County citiesof San Clemente and Seal Beach. Proposition E in Manhattan Beach, inLos Angeles County, would limit building heights and require voterapproval before residential areas can be rezoned for commercialdevelopments.   Critics say the anti-growth sentiment is a sign of racism andelitism, a product of the same thinking that spawns bumper stickersreading ``California Native'' or ``Welcome To California, Now GoHome.''   ``The people involved in the movement are typically wellensconsed and have their piece of the American dream,'' said JohnErskine, executive director of the Orange County Building IndustryAssociation.   Pasadena's ``Responsible Growth Initiative,'' or Proposition G,does less to stop growth and more to direct it. It asks thatdevelopments of 25,000 square feet or 25 units be approvedunanimously by the city's directors for the next two years andrequires that developers pick up the tab for sewers and roadimprovements and dedicate land or fees for parks.   Measure C in the Riverside County farm town of Hemet also wouldrequire developers rather than taxpayers to pay for growth, as wouldProposition R in the San Diego County city of San Marcos.</TEXT></DOC>
