In what was labeled a &quot;tentative decision,&quot; the judgefound that the current fee -- $3 for each bounced check -- isexcessive and represents an unfair business practice. Heinstructed the bank to collect no more than $1.73 a check,starting Aug. 1.</LP><TEXT>   A Bank of America spokesman, who called the decision&quot;simply erroneous,&quot; said that the BankAmerica Corp. unit willappeal the ruling, which Alameda County Superior Court JudgeJohn Sutter issued last Wednesday. Bank of America also willask the courts to stay the ruling until the bank hasexhausted its appeal.   &quot;We don't think the court has either the capability or thejurisdiction to make a decision on how we price ourservices,&quot; the bank said in a statement yesterday. Similarlysized financial institutions in California generally billretailers about the same or even more for returning bouncedchecks, but this suit was filed only against Bank of America.   Lawyers involved in such litigation over banks' servicefees -- which has been winding through the courts since theearly 1970s -- called the ruling unprecedented. &quot;It's thefirst decision in which a judge has told a bank, you areovercharging by almost double,&quot; said James Sturdevant, anattorney who has represented plaintiffs in several caseschallenging bank fees associated with credit-card services.&quot;That's pretty significant,&quot; he added. But Mr. Sturdevantcautioned that the case hasn't been battle tested yet. &quot;Atentative ruling by a single judge is a long way from beingfinal.&quot;   Pointing to several cost studies conducted by the FederalReserve and by Bank of America, itself, the judge noted thatit cost the bank anywhere from 24 cents to 60 cents toprocess a returned check. The resulting markup, he wrote inhis opinion, &quot;is certainly high enough to violate thecovenant of good faith and fair dealing between the depositorand the bank.&quot; It &quot;translates into millions of dollars ofexcess revenue flowing into the bank out of the pockets ofconsumers.&quot;   The suit was filed by California Grocers Association, anonprofit trade group. The group maintains that the averagesmall grocer winds up paying $1,200 a year -- or 2% of hisincome -- in bounced-check fees. &quot;We've been disgusted withthe way the banks have absolutely refused to do anything tohelp curb bad checks,&quot; said the association's president, DonBeaver. He called bank service fees &quot;the second-largestprofit center that banks have today.&quot;   A Bank of America spokesman said that the bank had takensteps to encourage customers to avoid unintentional bouncingof checks, by offering to sell them overdraft protection. Andbusinessess themselves must shoulder much of the blame, hesaid. &quot;We would hope that retailers would take pains to knowtheir customers,&quot; he said.   The California Grocers Association opted out of an earlierclass-action suit against Bank of America-Rudolfi vs. Bank ofAmerica. The group called the resulting out-of-courtsettlement in 1988 a &quot;sell-out&quot; by plaintiff attorneys, whoagreed to allow the bank to raise its fees in the future.   As part of that settlement, Bank of America agreed to givecustomers a coupon for $25 worth of banking services, tofinance low-income housing loans and to put $1 million inannual increments into a consumer trust fund. &quot;The banks gotoff, the lawyers got rich and the customers got nothing,&quot;said California Grocers Association's attorney, Manuel G.Abascal.   Mr. Abascal termed Judge Sutter's ruling &quot;restrained&quot; andsaid: &quot;Bank of America is lucky he didn't set {the acceptablefee} at 75 cents instead of $1.73, based on the evidence.&quot;Indeed, the judge wrote in his opinion that &quot;the $1.73 figureis probably on the high side.&quot;   Apart from billing retailers, Bank of America also charges$10 to customers who write bounced checks. And in 1987, itadded a $1 &quot;reclear&quot; fee, when it runs a check through asecond time in hopes that it will clear. The judge's rulingdoes not affect these charges to customers.   Judge Sutter noted that Bank of America had raised the feecharged retailers repeatedly in the 1980s (from 50 cents in1980 to $3 in 1985) and had increased fivefold all itsservice fees for processing bounced checks. Yet, he said, thecost of processing these checks had declined substantially inthe same period. Thanks to automation, the bank was able tocut sharply its staff processing bad checks. And the bank hasmade clear that it plans to lay off soon 40% more of theemployees currently processing bad checks.</TEXT></DOC>
