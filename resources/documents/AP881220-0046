AHN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government today announced anamnesty for more than 2,000 ``politically motivated offenders,''including two who were serving 20-year sentences for burning a U.S.government building.   The Justice Ministry said the clemency was approved at a specialCabinet session.   Ministry officials said 281 prisoners would be releasedWednesday, including Kim Hyun-jang and Moon Boo-shik, who wereserving 20-year sentences for leading a raid on the U.S. CulturalCenter in the southern city of Pusan in early 1982.   Protesters set fire to the building to protest U.S. support forthe government of then-President Chun Doo-hwan. One person waskilled and three were wounded.   Another 1,581 people already freed on parole will have theircivil rights restored Wednesday, 92 prisoners will have theirsentences reduced, and 61 people who were sought by police will betaken off the wanted list, authorities said..   Among those who will be granted restoration of civil rights isprominent dissident Kim Kun-tae, who was freed from prison in June,He received the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Human Rights in April.   Kim was sentenced to five years in prison in 1986 for incitingunrest, but supporters alleged he was forced to confess by policetorture.   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said in a statement that theleniency was a ``bold step intended to heal the depressing wounds ofthe past era and thus to promote democratization.''   He said the action was taken through consultations with all majorpolitical parties, as had been promised by President Roh Tae-woo.Roh pledged on Nov. 26 to release many political prisoners andinstitute other reforms to dissociate himself from Chun, hispredecessor.   The main opposition Party for Peace and Democracy said thegovernment amnesty was an important step toward democratization, butparty officials said there were still 60 more political prisoners tobe freed.   The Reunification Democratic Party, another opposition group,welcomed the measure, but dissident groups charged that Roh betrayedhis promise for a total release of political prisoners by excludingabout 300 political prisoners, mostly involved in movements forworkers and depressed people.   Government officials disagreed and claimed the figure was about200 who were involved mostly in communist spy cases and otheranti-state activities.</TEXT></DOC>
