In this context, the paper summarizesthe characteristics of various conventional methods of uncertainty andsensitivity analysis, mainly in the point of view of uncertainty propagation,sensitivity analysis, and reduced model construction capabilities. Then,a new technique based on the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test and stepwiseregression technique is suggested and applied to the thermal margin analysisfor peak clad temperature at loss of coolant accident, which is one ofthe most important parameters in the design and operation of nuclearreactors.</TEXT></DOC>
