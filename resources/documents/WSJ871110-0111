The conviction, upheld last June by a federal appeals court, also in Boston, was based on 31 counts of failure to obey federal laws requiring banks to file reports of all cash transactions in excess of $10,000. The reporting requirement is part of congressional efforts to crack down on the laundering of money from drug trafficking, organized crime and other illegal activities.    The Boston bank, a unit of Bank of New England Corp., was convicted for failure to report cash withdrawals by a convicted gambler in 1983 and 1984, and fined $40,000 for each of the 31 counts. Payment of the fine was stayed last July until the high court could act on the bank's appeal.    The bank argued that it shouldn't be held criminally liable. Its violations of the law were due to &quot;organizational indifference&quot; and lacked any criminal intent, it said. The bank also contended that the violations should be treated as a single felony, rather than 31 separate episodes. But the high court, without comment, refused to hear the appeal.    In a prepared statement, Bank of New England said, &quot;We are of course disappointed that the Supreme Court has declined to review our case, but it is now time to put the matter behind us.&quot;    Oil Overcharges   The high court let stand a federal appeals court ruling holding an Alabama oil man, Bart Chamberlain, and two companies, Citronelle-Mobile Gathering Services Inc. and Citmoco Services Inc., liable for $6.8 million in crude oil overcharges. With interest dating from 1973 and 1974, when the overcharges occurred, total liability is estimated to be in excess of $20 million. Mr. Chamberlain is president and principal shareholder of both companies.    The overcharges involve the sale of crude oil to the Bahamas at prices higher than were then allowed by domestic price controls. A special appeals court in Washington, D.C., that handles energy matters ruled in May that if Citronelle and Citmoco can't meet their liability, Mr. Chamberlain is personally liable for the full amount.    It is up to the Department of Energy to decide how the money should be paid to the persons or firms that were overcharged.    Sexual Counseling   The justices agreed to decide the constitutionality of a 1981 law that provides federal funding for groups that counsel unmarried teen-agers to abstain from sexual activity. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled last April that the law violated the First Amendment's separation of church and state because funds were provided to religious organizations to counsel teen-agers. The Reagan administration, defending the law, appealed directly to the Supreme Court. </TEXT></DOC>
