Last week, as a number of lenders began offeringfixed-rate mortgages below 9%, homeowners took the bait. AtGMAC Mortgage Corp., for instance, phone inquiries jumped 40%after the Elkins Park, Pa., unit of General Motors Corp.began advertising the new low rates on Monday.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Whenever you have a hard interestrate break from onedigit to another, you see a burst of activity,&quot; says TerenceWilliams, vice president of residential mortgage originationsat GMAC Mortgage Corp. Mortgage rates are now at their lowestlevels since 1978, with the 30-year fixed rate falling to9.05% last week, according to a survey of 2,000 lenders byHSH Associates Inc., a Butler, N.J., mortgage monitoringfirm.   According to a Mortgage Bankers Association index,refinancing activity is currently approaching levels seen inthe spring, when a sharp drop in rates triggered anotherburst of refinancing. Oddly, the lower rates are not pumpingup new home sales now as they did this past spring.   The refinancing market, however, is booming, with manyhome owners swapping their adjustable-rate mortgages forfixed-rate products in order to lock in at today's low rates.&quot;Falling rates add to the growth of the fixed-rate market,&quot;says Jonathan Gray, a thrift analyst with Sanford C.Bernstein andamp; Co.   &quot;In some cases, that will be good news (for lenders). Inother cases, it won't,&quot; notes Larry Dale, senior vicepresident of marketing and mortgage-backed securities for theFederal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, whichbuys loans from originators and packages them as securitiesfor resale to investors.   The flight to fixed-rate mortgages is a boon to mortgagebanks and some commercial banks, which make fixed-rate loansstrictly for resale into the secondary market. They turn aprofit by continuing to service the loans. These servicingportfolios held by mortgage bankers are growing.   &quot;Anyone who is in servicing is doing extremely well,&quot;concludes Bruce Harting, a thrift analyst with SalomonBrothers Inc.   That success, however, is coming at the expense of thriftsand some commercial banks, which prefer to makeadjustable-rate loans to hold in their own portfolios. Therisk of holding such loans is low, because their rates trackthe cost of funds, thereby cutting interest-rate risk.   These lenders now face the choice of converting many loansfrom adjustable-rate to fixed-rate, or lose the business tomortgage bankers. Those who do convert shed the interest-raterisk by selling the new fixed-rate loans into the secondarymarket.   &quot;It's more profitable to originate and hold an ARM inportfolio than to originate and service a fixed-rate loan,&quot;says Sam Lyons, senior vice president of mortgage banking atGreat Western Financial Corp., a large Beverly Hills, Calif.,thrift.   &quot;In a predominantly fixed-rate market, loan servicing bybanks and thrifts will grow, but their loan portfolios willshrink,&quot; says Mr. Harting. &quot;We're looking at lowering ourestimates for a number of the Sandamp;L's, because their assets aregoing to be shrinking.&quot;   At best, he says, many institutions will see theirportfolios hold steady. But a 5% to 10% shrinkage is morelikely, he says.   &quot;The challenge of 1991 is trying to replace the runoff ofyour portfolio to other lenders,&quot; says Mr. Lyons. &quot;Ourportfolio is not shrinking. But it's not growing by leaps andbounds.&quot;   Citicorp, a large portfolio lender, is also feeling thesqueeze. Albert Sofia, vice president of residential realestate credit, says that Citicorp's portfolio of unsoldmortgages is shrinking a bit, but the bank aims to retain thefixed-rate loan servicing business. &quot;It costs us more to losethe customer than to refinance,&quot; says Mr. Sofia.   Refinancings are also hurting investors in mortgage-backsecurities. Loan prepayments mean lower-than-expectedinvestment yields; those who want to reinvest in newsecurities must do so at lower rates.   However, Fannie Mae and its secondary market rival, theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., which both sell thesecurities, have capitalized over the past two months byissuing new securities at record levels, says Sanford C.Bernstein's Mr. Gray.</TEXT></DOC>
