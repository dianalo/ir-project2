(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Boeing Co. maintained a secretlibrary of classified documents through much of the 1970s at amarketing office in Kent, Wash., a retired employee of theaerospace giant testified today.   The witness, Gloria Mahaffey, testified at the U.S. DistrictCourt trial of Richard Lee Fowler, a onetime Boeing Co. employeeaccused of illegally obtaining classified budget documents from theDepartment of Defense.   He has pleaded innocent to 39 felony counts, includingconspiracy, illegal conveyance of classified documents and mailfraud.   Ms. Mahaffey, who has been granted immunity from prosecution byU.S. attorneys, said the documents were used by a ``very selectgroup of marketing managers for Boeing.''   She said they were delivered to her by Fowler, among otherBoeing employees, but were not entered into a company log used tokeep track of classified documents.   At times she obscured with correction fluid or covered withsmall pieces of paper the classification stamp on the documents,Ms. Mahaffey said.   When the documents became obsolete, she said, she destroyedthem. ``I took them home and burned them in my fireplace, page bypage,'' she said.   At one point in the mid 1970s, Ms. Mahaffey said, she wasordered to destroy the documents in the library and to immediatelyleave and lock her office.   Instead, Ms. Mahaffey said, she volunteered to take thedocuments home where they sat in her recreation room for about twoweeks. Eventually ``I was called to come back to work and open upshop again,'' she said.   Ms. Mahaffey testified that when she set up the library in Kentin 1973 or 1974 she was told the data was ``commonly usedthroughout the industry. The impression I had was that thedocuments were not generally in the public domain but that othercompanies had access.''   Fowler worked at Boeing from 1978 until he was fired in 1986. Hecould face 310 years in prison and fines of $225,000 if convicted.   During the first day of testimony Monday, former Secretary ofDefense Frank Carlucci said it was well known around the Pentagonthat documents Fowler is accused of stealing ``were not releasabledocuments.''   But under cross-examination, Carlucci said that during his timeat the Department of Defense he did not believe defense contractorswere told directly that they couldn't have the documents.   Carlucci said the documents Fowler is accused of taking wereamong the ``most sensitive'' ones in the Pentagon outside ofintelligence documents.   Lawyers for Fowler said Monday that their client did nothingillegal and suggested he was being prosecuted because he refused toname the Defense Department employees who gave him the documents.   During opening arguments, defense lawyer John Bray said therules covering release of such documents ``are not clear, they arenot specific.''   John Klein, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the jury Fowlerengaged in a conspiracy that included the ``unlawful acquisition,conveyance, use, dissemination and destruction'' of classifieddocuments.   Boeing pleaded guilty Nov. 13 to receiving classified documentsfrom Fowler and agreed to pay $5.2 million in fines andrestitution. In addition, Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz compliedwith a judge's order to write a letter of contrition.   The Air Force has suspended Boeing's 100-person Washington-areaoffice from bidding on contracts and has proposed a long-termdebarment of the branch office from contract bidding.</TEXT></DOC>
