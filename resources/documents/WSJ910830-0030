The ruling party's candidate, former Mexico City MayorRamon Aguirre, was expected to announce at a news conferencescheduled for last night that he was bowing out. The statehas been swept with street protests since last week when Mr.Aguirre was declared winner of the Aug. 18 election with 53%of the vote, compared with 39% for Vicente Fox of theconservative National Action Party, or PAN.</LP><TEXT>   A government official stressed the decision was strictlyMr. Aguirre's, and was no reflection on the fairness of theelection. But it's inconceivable in Mexico's presidentialistsystem that such an action could have been taken without thedirection of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.   In addition to quieting tensions in Guanajuato, the actionalso could add credibility to the results in other midtermraces, in which Mr. Gortari's ruling InstitutionalRevolutionary Party, or PRI, won 61% of congressional seatsand five other governors' races. The action also servesnotice on other local PRI bosses to refrain from theballot-rigging that has long been countenanced by the party.   &quot;We see it as something very healthy for democracy inMexico,&quot; the official said. &quot;It's a lesson in politicalmaturity for the PRI and the opposition.&quot;   The PRI, the longest-reigning political party in thenon-Communist world, saw the midterm elections as a key testin the wake of its weak showing in national elections of1988. So the ruling party geared up a massive registrationcampaign, targeted new public works to woo potential votersand -- in a number of cases -- resorted to time-testedmethods of balloting fraud. But analysts say these oldpractices resulted in an election day victory toooverwhelming to be credible with a skeptical Mexican public.   In Guanajuato, pre-election polls had shown Mr. Aguirrenarrowly ahead of the PAN's Mr. Fox. But on election daythere were widespread allegations of polling irregularities.According to neutral observers, state transit policeintimidated opposition voters, PRI operatives made off withballot boxes and electoral officials sympathetic to the PRIsaw to it that PAN strongholds were without sufficientballots. As a result, more than 500 voting booths wentunanimously for the PRI.   The local Congress, which is controlled by the PRI, wouldname an interim governor until new elections are called,probably within a matter of months.   A leading figure in Mexico's political old-guard, Mr.Aguirre was one of six PRI members who vied for thepresidential nomination won by Salinas in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
