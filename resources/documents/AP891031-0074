Lawyers on Monday began questioning potential jurors one at atime about their knowledge of the Jan. 16 shooting, which touchedoff three days of rioting that left one person dead and causedmillions in damage.   People were called into the courtroom from a jury pool createdlast week and were asked how they felt about past riots and thepotential for more violence after a verdict.   A white woman in her 50s said she couldn't put aside her fear ofviolence and was dismissed.   ``It's frightening,'' she said. ``You're afraid that if you wereon the jury and brought in a verdict the black community didn'twant to hear, there'd be rioting.''   In all, nine people were retained and five excused Monday. Thoseexcused included two men and a woman, all white, who had formedstrong opinions on the case, and a black woman with seven children.   Selection of potential jurors was to continue today.   The trial of Colombian-born William Lozano, 30, has raised fearsof more violence in Miami, which erupted in 1980, 1982 and 1984after slayings of black men by police or the officers' acquittals.   The Miami officer is charged in the deaths of Clement AnthonyLloyd, 23, who was shot in the head during a chase, and AllanBlanchard, 24, a passenger killed in the crash of Lloyd'smotorcycle.   Lozano contends he fired in self-defense.   Some of those questioned said there was the potential for unrestwhichever way the verdict went.   ``There's two sides and somebody's going to be dissatisfied,''said one middle-aged woman. She was retained for the jury pool.   This year's disturbance started on the Martin Luther Kingholiday and came as Miami got ready to be host of the Super Bowl.</TEXT></DOC>
