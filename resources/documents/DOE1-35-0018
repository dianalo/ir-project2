For a 10 ton pilot plant, variouslarge-size chemical reaction tubes were prepared as a trial and experimented.The strength of the tubes was satisfactory except for some tubes. Thereaction tubes were SiC-CVD treated for cleaning anti-corrosion. Presenceof free SiC and C in the CVD film reduces the anti-corrosion and hardnessof the film. No troubles were found on adhesion between the film andthe base. A large scale CVD unit was manufactured. The trial tubes areunder experiment by using a 10 ton pilot plant. The tube had no initialrupture and were durabic to 400 hour operation and cleaning. A largescale reactor was developed, in which the tube structure was modifiedfrom the double to the single one. A rough design for a 1000 - 10000ton / year pilot plant and an automatic control system were developed.The 10 ton / year pilot plant was operated for testing of the reactiontube life time.
