In seven days, he put in 97 hours of work.    Chronically short of control-room staff, Edison for years was able to keep Pilgrim running only because of excessive overtime, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission says. Frustrated by the utility's sluggish response to repeated NRC criticism, the agency ordered Edison not to restart Pilgrim when equipment malfunctions forced a shutdown 15 months ago.    Eighty miles to the south, at Northeast Utilities' Millstone 1 nuclear plant, overtime is rare. The Waterford, Conn., plant has so many operators on the payroll -- and it has had for the past 16 years -- that each such worker spends one week of every six in training classes.    Pilgrim and Millstone 1 are comparable in size, design and vintage, but in one crucial respect, they aren't at all alike: The NRC ranks Pilgrim one of the worst-managed nuclear plants in the country and Millstone one of the best.    For years, the debate over nuclear power has focused on design safety, construction quality, emergency plans, human error and regulatory competence. But more and more, regulators, the industry and the public are dwelling on how well plants are managed.    Bad management may be common enough in American business, but the risks presented by badly run nuclear plants are frightening. &quot;No level of technical safeguards can make a nuclear facility safe unless it has good management,&quot; the NRC told Congress last year. Indeed, the agency recently has begun to close plants because of management, not just mechanical, shortcomings. In April, for instance, the agency ordered Philadelphia Electric Co. to turn off its Peach Bottom plant after inspectors found operators asleep at the controls.    &quot;We expect one or more serious operating events in each of the next several years, resulting in a prolonged, unplanned shutdown of a nuclear plant,&quot; says Paul Parshley, a utility-bond analyst at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities Corp. &quot;The 'worst' operators bear a disproportionately large share of the risk of nuclear accidents.&quot;    For all its failings, Pilgrim hasn't had a major accident. But some of the worst mishaps at American nuclear power plants have been blamed on a series of relatively minor foul-ups that plague poorly managed plants. Badly run plants also shut down more frequently, produce more contaminated garbage, expose workers to more radiation and produce less electricity. In the past 15 months, Pilgrim has generated as much power as Plymouth Rock, which is to say none. Millstone 1, though currently shut down for routine refueling, has generated enough to supply a city of 540,000.    Northeast Utilities and Boston Edison offer a contrast between a utility that paid attention to detail and one that didn't; between a plant that hasn't been fined a penny by the NRC and one that has had to shell out $666,000 in various fines; between a utility that hired a local fire department to teach workers how to fight a real fire and one that didn't even train its own fire brigade to use the plant's fire truck.    Managing a nuclear power plant is different from managing one that uses fossil fuel. Besides the problems that accompany radioactivity, nuclear plants are bigger and more complex; they are crammed with redundant safety features needing maintenance, and they are far more closely scrutinized by regulators and the public.    Northeast realized all that long ago. &quot;It never occurred to me that they were alike,&quot; says Northeast's chairman, William B. Ellis, who says the distinctions were sharply drawn within the company when he was hired in 1976. But Edison came late to such understanding, says Ralph G. Bird, a retired admiral from the nuclear Navy who became Edison's senior vice president for nuclear early this year. &quot;It was not seen as something different,&quot; he says. &quot;It was just another way to generate steam and make electricity.&quot;    At Millstone, a motto inscribed on the wall of a training facility expresses management's philosophy: &quot;Excellence in operations is the sum of many small details done right.&quot; At Pilgrim, management's attitude has been different, says Thomas Murphy, a veteran Pilgrim plant operator. He expresses the company's attitude this way: &quot;We have to make a profit. We do what we have to do. We don't do more than we have to do.&quot;    Of course, Millstone 1's record does have its blemishes. In 1980, for instance, rusted switches caused water to back up into steam generators, thus breaking dozens of turbine blades and shutting the plant for six months. And, recently, the NRC scolded Northeast for sloppiness in packing contaminated garbage before shipping it to a South Carolina dump. But Millstone 1, the oldest of three plants that sit a few miles from a nuclear-submarine base on Long Island Sound, long has had better-than-average performance, according to NRC and industry measures.    The problems at Pilgrim -- which accounts for a quarter of Edison's generating capacity -- date at least to the early 1980s. In 1981, the NRC discovered that a safety system hadn't been installed to NRC requirements, despite Edison's statements to the contrary. The agency levied a $550,000 fine, more than it had fined any utility before. Edison reshuffled management, hired consultants and counted 126 improvements it had made. Nevertheless, the NRC review of the plant's 1985 record complained that &quot;problems tend to linger for long periods until drastic measures are taken.&quot; And it noted &quot;a pattern of performance that raises . . . questions.&quot; Finally, after malfunctions forced Pilgrim to shut down in April 1986, the NRC -- in the midst of the post-Chernobyl controversy over nuclear power -- said Pilgrim would stay shut until Edison finally licked its management problems.    Edison now acknowledges Pilgrim's shortcomings. Besides hiring Mr. Bird, it has named a new plant manager, recruited new operators, doubled the maintenance staff and begun an extensive decontamination and construction effort to make the plant safer. NRC officials say conditions at Pilgrim are better, but not yet good enough. &quot;We remain to be convinced,&quot; says James Wiggins, who oversees the plant from the NRC's regional office in King of Prussia, Pa.    Despite Pilgrim's progress, a comparison of the two nuclear plants and their owners illustrates how differently the two similar plants were run.    Consider the job of plant superintendent, the person who oversees day-to-day operations. Millstone 1 has had two in the past five years. Pilgrim has had three different superintendents in the past year alone. Northeast, exceeding NRC requirements, demands that superintendents maintain NRC operator licenses for the plants they run. Edison doesn't.    Millstone has always had clear lines of authority: The staff reports to the superintendent. Until recently, the staff at Pilgrim reported to one man when the plant was operating and to another when it was closed for refueling or repairs. At Millstone, the superintendent visits the control room nearly every morning to check the logs and chat with the staff. &quot;If he doesn't go, I'll talk to him. It's important that they get the impression that everybody cares,&quot; says Wayne Romberg, Northeast's vice president for nuclear operations. At Pilgrim, operators say they rarely see the superintendent in the control room.    Then, too, there is the matter of fire protection, which has been a big issue at nuclear plants since a serious fire at the Browns Ferry nuclear plant in Alabama in 1975. At one point last year, Pilgrim had so much broken equipment and so many violations of fire-safety rules, according to the NRC, that it had to hire people to do nothing but watch for fires at 72 different locations in the plant. That number is declining now, but &quot;not fast enough,&quot; Mr. Bird says. Millstone has no such monitors at the moment, and it doesn't feel the need of any.    Pilgrim has had problems with radiation, as well. For years, Pilgrim has been an industry leader in the number of workers exposed to radiation and in the total amount of radiation to which workers have been exposed. Even after the NRC ordered Edison to beef up its radiation-protection program in 1984, &quot;improvements weren't closely monitored by site management,&quot; the NRC said last year. Pilgrim doesn't dispute that conclusion. Disagreements between plant radiation experts and maintenance workers, for instance, resulted in &quot;unnecessary discussions . . . in a high-radiation area,&quot; it said. Edison since has filled the long-vacant chief radiological engineer's post and scrubbed away much of the radioactive debris that contaminated the plant.    Millstone 1 -- though criticized by the NRC for &quot;strong control over high-exposure jobs but multiple lapses in routine radiation controls&quot; -- has exposed workers to only a third the radiation workers at Pilgrim have experienced in the past three years.    Stephen J. Sweeney, Edison's chairman and chief executive, replied to questions from an angry shareholder at the company's annual meeting this year that Edison had concentrated on making Pilgrim &quot;physically capable of running well&quot; but that Edison had overlooked other aspects of running the plant. &quot;It takes almost as long to get out of a situation as it does to get into it,&quot; he said. &quot;It has taken far too long. . . . We know it. But we are making an accelerating pace of improvements.&quot;    How does a utility find itself with a poorly run nuclear plant? How did Edison find itself in such a fix?    &quot;If you don't have the discipline in operations and maintenance that corrects the small problems, then you get behind, and catching up is difficult,&quot; says Mr. Bird, Edison's new senior vice president. When he arrived in January, he found a maintenance backlog of 12,000 separate items, more than half of which have since been fixed. None of the items were critical, but the long list demonstrated the inadequacy of Pilgrim's maintenance staffing and scheduling system.    The paper work for tracking maintenance at Pilgrim was such a mess that a worker might fix a valve and return it to service without realizing that another maintenance request was outstanding on the same valve, says Neil Brosee, who oversees maintenance at Pilgrim. The plant is now installing a computerized maintenance-tracking system. Millstone did that four years ago.    As companies, Edison and Northeast differ, of course. Northeast, with 1986 revenue of $2.03 billion, is twice as large as Edison, which had revenue of $1.11 billion, and Northeast is generally regarded as better managed. Edison, though financially strong, has been roundly criticized by regulators and others for a variety of management sins. Edison runs just one nuclear plant. Northeast runs four, giving it the wherewithal to hire in-house experts that Edison can't afford. That doesn't fully explain the contrasting records, though. Zack T. Pate, the president of the industry-sponsored Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, says some utilities with just one plant have good records, and some with several have bad ones.    Mr. Pate suggests that unlike fossil-fueled plants, nuclear plants demand managers with the potential to fill a utility's top jobs. &quot;We have heard the argument that old Charlie is a good man in the plant, but he just wouldn't work out in the corporate office,&quot; he says. &quot;If good old Charlie doesn't have the potential to become the nuclear vice president, then you can bet that he isn't providing the proper motivation and leadership.&quot;    At Pilgrim, not one of the seven former plant superintendents has been promoted in the Edison hierarchy. At Northeast, the vice president for nuclear operations, the senior vice president for nuclear and the executive vice president for engineering and operations all are former Millstone managers. Another former Millstone superintendent recently resigned as Northeast's president to become chief executive of a New Jersey utility.    The benefits of a well-run nuclear plant are obvious. Boston Edison illustrates how severe the penalties can be for running one poorly. The company's image is in tatters. Its biggest asset is out of service, at least until mid-September. It is spending $200,000 a day -- $91 million so far -- to buy electricity to replace what Pilgrim would have generated.    And it faces the possibility of the ultimate penalty: a plant it can never use. Pilgrim's critics want the NRC to forbid Edison to restart the plant. And a panel of the Massachusetts legislature recently asked state utility regulators to explain where the state will get its electricity if Pilgrim is shut down for five more years.    ---                   Two Power Plants Compared                                PILGRIM        MILLSTONE 1 Owner                          Boston         Northeast                                Edison Co.
