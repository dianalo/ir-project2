Officials at Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., said the purchase of Rediffusion Simulation from BET PLC, a British international-services concern, would give Hughes 35% of the private airline market world-wide for simulators and 40% of the British military market.    Hughes expects world-wide military and civilian flight-simulator sales to grow to $4 billion in five years from its current $3 billion. &quot;Simulators will be used increasingly by military customers to train pilots. . .as defense budgets flatten out,&quot; said Albert D. Wheelon, Hughes chairman.    Hughes officials said they plan to operate Rediffusion as a subsidiary. Rediffusion had sales of $260 million in 1987 with 2,500 employees at plants in Crawley, England, and Arlington, Texas.    The acquisition, expected to be completed in May, would greatly increase Hughes's flight-training-equipment production. Hughes makes weapons-tactics trainers for the Navy's F/A-18 aircraft and mission trainers for the Navy's F-14A aircraft. </TEXT></DOC>
