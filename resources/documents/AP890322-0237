Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., a frequent critic of theenvironmental policies of then-President Reagan, applauded thecoastal barrier plan completed in the final days of the Reaganadminstration, calling it ``a very good start.''   But Studds, chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheriessubcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation, was told byInterior officials that the Bush adminstration does not have aposition on the recommendations and no legislation would be offeredby the White House.   ``As I understand it, the administration would be in a reactivemode,'' reacting to whatever proposal Congress comes up with, saidSusan Reece-Lamson, deputy assistant interior secretary for fish andwildlife.   Beth Millemann, director of the Coast Alliance, an environmentallobby, said after the hearing that the administration's activebacking would be helpful but not mandatory for success this year.   ``I think it will go through if Congress is willing to act outits commitment to reducing the deficit and protecting coastalbarriers,'' Ms. Millemann said. ``They don't have to depend on theadministration to jump on this.''   But Studds said that ``there is no way on earth'' Congress willexpand coastal barrier protection without strong backing from theWhite House.   Subcommittee aides pointed to the intense pressure developers canplace on their local House members. The legislation would affectnearly every coastal district from Maine to Texas, and coastalbarrier advocates expect a heavy lobbying push from the building andreal estate industries.   Coastal barriers are elongated, narrow landforms made of sand andsediments that protect wetlands, lagoons and salt marshes from oceanwaves. They include barrier islands, barrier spits and bay barriers.   In 1982, Congress and the Reagan adminstration, led bythen-Interior Secretary James Watt agreed to prohibit federalbuilding subsidizes for 452,834 acres of undeveloped coastalbarriers along 666 miles of shoreline along the East Coast and Gulfof Mexico.   The law bans federal expenditures on the protected lands,including federal flood insurance, disaster relief, community blockgrants, housing loans, water and wastewater treatment grants andbeach erosion project aid.   The idea is to discourage development of the land, which isenvironmentally fragile and could pose dangers to residents, whilesaving federal money.   Ms. Reece-Lamson told the subcommittee that there has been nosignificant development on the already protected tracts since theban on federal flood insurance took effect in 1983.   In December, the Reagan administration recommended adding 790,884acres of coastal barrier lands along 423 miles of shoreline to theprotection. The proposal would save an estimated $3 billion,according to an Interior Department report.   Environmentalists said the Interior Department plan does not gofar enough. They say it should include coastal barriers on the WestCoast and Great Lakes and other areas on the East Coast.   A 1985 government study identified more than 5.8 million acres ofU.S. coastal barriers along an estimated 2,500 miles of shoreline.</TEXT></DOC>
