Howard Metzenbaum said he may seek tosubpoena one of President Bush's former aides, who as alobbyist helped an Arizona insurance executive buy 15 Texasthrifts even though his bid was apparently $97 million moreexpensive to the government than a competitor's.   The Ohio Democrat, who is conducting an inquiry into thegovernment's December 1988 sale of the insolvent savings andloan associations to James Fail, said he will ask the SenateJudiciary Committee to subpoena Robert Thompson if he won'ttestify voluntarily.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Thompson was an aide to George Bush when he was vicepresident. After leaving Mr. Bush's staff, Mr. Thompson wroteto Danny Wall, then the head of the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, urging consideration of Mr. Fail's offer for the Sandamp;Ls.   Sen. Metzenbaum also said he may seek a subpoena for thetestimony of I.C.H. Corp. Chairman Robert Shaw. Sen.Metzenbaum said at a hearing that Mr. Shaw arranged forChicago-based Bankers Life Insurance Co., a unit of I.C.H.,to loan $35 million to Mr. Fail to back the purchase of thethrifts, which Mr. Fail consolidated and now runs asBluebonnet Savings Bank.   The senator said documents obtained by investigators onhis staff suggest that Mr. Shaw personally received the rightto 50% of the profits or ownership of Dallas-basedBluebonnet, although the loans were made by Bankers Life.   In testimony before the senator's Judiciary subcommittee,Zack Stamp, the top insurance regulator for the state ofIllinois, wouldn't discuss details of his agency's inquiryinto the matter. However, he said there was &quot;the likelihoodof an administrative or criminal action out of theinformation {subcommittee investigators} gave us.&quot;   Mr. Stamp didn't elaborate, but said it was a violation ofIllinois regulations for officers of insurance companies toengage in activities that would benefit themselves withoutreporting such activities to state regulators. A spokesmanfor I.C.H., an insurance-holding company based in Louisville,Ky., didn't return a telephone call seeking comment.   A lawyer for both Mr. Fail and Mr. Thompson denounced Sen.Metzenbaum's inquiry as &quot;motivated by sheer politicalopportunism&quot; and questioned whether the senator'ssubcommittee had the jurisdiction to look into Sandamp;L matters.Another spokesman for Mr. Fail and Mr. Thompson said nodecision had been made on whether the two men will testifyvoluntarily.   Sen. Metzenbaum said he hopes the committee will issuesubpoenas within a week if the two men refuse to testify.   Mr. Wall, the former Bank Board chairman who oversaw thesale of the thrifts, said, &quot;there was no political pressurewhatsoever&quot; from Mr. Thompson. In fact, Mr. Wall said, heknew Weston Edwards, the businessman whose bid was apparently$97 million cheaper for the government, &quot;better than I knewThompson.&quot; Mr. Wall said the Bank Board staff recommended Mr.Fail's bid and &quot;that's what the full board -- two Republicansand a Democrat -- approved.&quot;   Sen. Metzenbaum said Mr. Wall had declined to testify atyesterday's hearing. Mr. Wall said he had been invited onlylast week, and that he would testify if given enough time toprepare.   Sen. Metzenbaum has criticized the sale of the 15 thriftsas a giveaway in which Mr. Fail put up only $1,000 of his ownmoney and borrowed $70 million, while the U.S. pledged $1.85billion in assistance.   But Stanley Brand, the attorney for Messrs. Fail andThompson, said Mr. Fail also &quot;pledged virtually all hisholdings as collateral . . . {It} is ludicrous and unfair topretend that he does not have a substantial stake in thewell-being of these institutions.&quot;   Separately, Common Cause, the self-styled citizens lobby,said that people associated with Columbia Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, Beverly Hills, Calif., gave a total of $284,900in campaign contributions to political candidates and partycommittees from January 1981 through April 1990.   Last week, the Office of Thrift Supervision filedadministrative charges against Thomas Spiegel, former chiefexecutive of the thrift, alleging he spent several milliondollars of thrift funds on personal expenses. The thriftoffice is seeking a record $24 million in fines andrestitution from Mr. Spiegel, who has denied any wrongdoing.   Common Cause said that federal filings show Mr. Spiegelmade a $100,000 &quot;soft money&quot; contribution benefitingPresident Bush's 1988 campaign. Soft money contributions aregiven to political parties and aren't subject to limits ofthe federal election laws.   The Common Cause study showed that Senate BankingCommittee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) ledcongressional recipients of donations from Columbiaofficials, their spouses, and Columbia's political actioncommittee during the period with $29,000. Utah Sen. JakeGarn, the committee's ranking Republican, was second with$25,200.   Sen. Metzenbaum was seventh with $11,000. Sen. Metzenbaumsaid at yesterday's hearing, &quot;I raised eight or nine milliondollars for my last campaign. Columbia clearly didn't buy afriend of the savings-and-loan industry in me.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
