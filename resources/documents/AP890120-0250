PLC said it was dropping the attempt, which would havebeen Britain's largest ever takeover.   However, Metsun Ltd., in its announcement Thursday, left open thepossibility of launching a future bid for the giant Britishelectronics company.   The decision follows several recent ``significant events,''including last Friday's announcement of a major joint venturebetween GEC and its unrelated U.S. counterpart, General ElectricCo., Metsun said.   ``Metsun continues to believe that a new direction is needed atGEC in order to enhance shareholder value,'' the company said in abrief statement. ``It doesn't consider that GEC will achieve this byplacing a substantial proportion of its business in a series ofjoint ventures over which GEC and its shareholders mightn't exercisecomplete control.''   Metsun announced earlier this month that it had been formed toput together an international consortium which might or might notbid for GEC.   Plessey Co., another British elecronics company which is thetarget of a joint takeover attempt by GEC and West Germany's SiemensAG, had been expected to join a consortium bid for GEC.   Such participation would have been what Wall Street calls the PacMan defense because of its similarity with the eat-or-be-eaten videogame.   Metsun said Lazard Brothers and Co., a merchant banker for bothMetsun and Plessey, had arranged talks with several internationalcompanies, including GE, American Telephone and Telegraph Co. andFrance's Thomson SA, in an effort to form a consortium to make anexpected bid for GEC of between 6.5 billion and 8 billion pounds.That would be equivalent to around $11 billion to $14.1 billion.   Metsun also announced that ``in view of the potential conflict''of Lazard Brothers being adviser to both Plessey and Metsun, thecompany had decided to replace Lazard with Baring Brothers and Co.Ltd.   The decision to drop the GEC takeover came on Baring Brothers'advice and Lazard agreed with it, Metsun said.   The potential bid ran into trouble last Thursday, when theBritish government said it would conduct a three-month investigationinto the GEC-Siemens 1.7 billion pound ($3 billion) bid for Plessey.The move likely would obstruct any bid for GEC by Metsun until theinvestigation's conclusion in early April.   Last Friday GE, another party seen as central to Metsun's plans,announced its joint venture with GEC.   GE will pay GEC 325 million pounds ($572 million) under theagreement, in which the two electronics giants will merge theirEuropean consumer products, medical equipment and some of theirelectrical divisions.   The GE-GEC venture, the government investigation and Plessey'sdefensive strategies make it ``really quite impossible to go ahead''with a bid at this point, said a Metsun spokesman, who wasn'tidentified in accordance with British practice.</TEXT></DOC>
