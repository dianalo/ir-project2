Both 44 and 100 keVimages are digitised in 128 x 128 matrices and processed in a SiemensMicroDelta System attached to a VAX 11-750 computer. Shorter imagingtime, low source strength and the usage of existing nuclear medicineequipment are the major highlights of the technique. In external standardsmade of various amounts of hydroxyapatite, a correlation coefficientgreater than 0.990 with a standard error of the estimate (SEE) 0.0225is obtained between measured and actual values. In a limited clinicaltrial, high-resolution images of human spines are acquired and quantitativeestimates of bone mineral content are evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
