The Taiwan delegation refused to reduce tariffs on 60agricultural products, or to lift import bans on peanuts, poultryand animal organs.   Another U.S. request to renew a five-year bilateral agreementnext year that limits Taiwan's rice exports was also rejected.   Taiwan called for scrapping a 1986 agreement that allows localmagazines to advertize American cigarettes, claiming it promotessmoking and also causes hardship for local tobacco growers. U.S.officials rejected the request.   ``We would not consider reducing tariffs on agriculturalproducts because we did not protect our farmers more than yourcountry did,'' said Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien, whoheads the Taiwan delegation.   Taiwan officials, however, promised to review later a U.S.proposal for tariff cuts on about 110 industrial products to helpreduce Taiwan's massive trade surplus with the United States, whichtotaled $16 billion last year.   Hundreds of farmers protested in the capital Taipei earlier inthe week, exhorting the government to resist any U.S. demands. Thefarmers claimed Taiwan's earlier tariff cuts on fruits and otheragricultural products have already hurt their livelihoods.   Taiwan reduced tariffs on 3,500 foreign products in February,including 480 agricultural items. Import duties dropped to anaverage rate of 22.6 percent from 35 percent.   In the latest talks, Taiwanese negotiators agreed to takemeasures to curb what the Americans called the rampant infringementof U.S. intellectual property rights, but differed with their U.S.counterparts on major details.   Taiwan officials agreed in principle that translations of U.S.works require the permission of their authors, but opposed makingthe agreement retroactive.   ``The discussion of a bilateral copyright agreement was verydisappointing,'' Allgeier said. ``Taiwan's positions areout-of-step with more positive trends elsewhere in the region.''   He said U.S. companies lose ``tens of millions of U.S. dollars''every year because of pirated U.S. works in Taiwan.   Taiwan agreed in 1985 to extend protection to all original U.S.copyrighted works published after 1975, but pirated books are stillavailable at many book stores. That agreement does not extend totranslations.   Taiwan also agreed tentatively to give either patent orcopyright protection to U.S. semiconductor products.   Taiwan, however, refused to allow American banks to set upbranches outside of Taipei or ease restrictions on their creditservices.   ``We know the modernization of our financial businesses can helpwith our economic development, but this has to be taken step bystep,'' Wang said.   Officials said more negotiation sessions will be held in Juneand August to settle these differences.</TEXT></DOC>
