James Law, 51 years old, was in charge of testingammunition manufactured by Honeywell, which at the timeoperated the Joliet Army Arsenal near Joliet, Ill.</LP><TEXT>   In April, Mr. Law pleaded guilty to charges of conspiringto defraud the government. He told the court that, underpressure from Honeywell to get out the ammunition quickly, hefalsified test results between 1984 and 1987, and that thegovernment as a result paid $15 million for 1.1 millionrounds of substandard ammunition.   Honeywell voluntarily informed the government of Mr. Law'smisdeeds when it learned of them in 1988, a prosecutor in theU.S. attorney's office said. Honeywell last year spun off toshareholders its munitions and weapons operations -- nowknown as Alliant Techsystems Inc.   &quot;It is absolutely clear that Law acted as a result ofpressure put on him by Honeywell,&quot; the prosecutor said.   Mr. Law's former assistant, Russell Miller, has also beencharged in connection with the case and is expected to go totrial. Mr. Law is cooperating with the government against Mr.Miller.   No one was injured by trying to use the defectiveammunition, which wasn't properly water-proofed. Theammunition consisted of .25-caliber and .30-caliber roundsused in the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and some helicopters.   Alliant Techsystems officials weren't available forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
