The U.S. public seems tothink that supporting Mikhail Gorbachev is more importantthan the rights of the Lithuanian people toself-determination and that U.S. support of Lithuania wouldbe some kind of interference in Soviet domestic affairs.   This confusion can be cleared up by an understanding ofRussian history. Conservatives sometimes call the U.S.S.R.the Soviet empire because the Soviet Union is indeed acolonial empire, the same as Czarist Russia in all but name,and the last surviving such empire in the world. Just likethe British and the French empires, it acquired much of itsterritory by military conquest during the 100 years from thelate 18th century to the late 19th.</LP><TEXT>   During the era of decolonization in the 1950s and 1960sthere was a general public consensus that empires had to bedissolved because most colonies had the right toindependence. But partly because that movement was originallyleftist inspired, everyone forgot about the Soviet empire.   It is time to recognize the necessity of decolonization.Not because we want to &quot;cause trouble for Gorbachev,&quot; butbecause there is a moral obligation for the West, includingthe U.S., to support freedom and independence for the captivenationalities of the &quot;Prison of nations.&quot;   Eiketsu Hirose   Livonia, Mich.   ---   Congratulations on the thorough and objective reporting ofthe situation and activities in Lithuania. Your excellentreport was perhaps lacking only in some historic perspectiveto help alleviate the &quot;tradition of xenophobia&quot; of theAmerican people by revisiting the events of the holocaust inUkraine in the mid-1920s, when some 10 million Ukrainianpeasants were starved to death by our onetime ally, JosefStalin, because of their resistance to agriculturalcollectivization. This was accomplished by cutting offsupplies to the region and by a blockade not too dissimilarto what is now being implemented by our &quot;entrusted&quot; futurebusiness partner Mikhail Gorbachev. Several of the Ukraineblockade masterminds and Stalin's henchmen, including LazarKaganovich, still reside in Moscow on relatively comfortablepensions.   Ivars Reimanis   Phoenix, Ariz.   ---   I fear that the current Lithuanian course of action couldderail the reforms taking place and could give Soviethardliners the chance to retake power. Lithuania, unlike theWarsaw Pact countries, is actually a part of the SovietUnion; our administration disavows so because of the way itcame about.   Lithuania was an independent, sovereign, self-governingcountry until it was invaded and conquered by the SovietUnion in 1940, and subsequently annexed. Today it forms asubstantial part of the Soviet Union's western frontier, andis probably indispensable to the Soviets' national-securitystrategy, at least for a while. The difference and extremedelicacy of this situation might be better seen with aconvenient analogy.   Hawaii was an independent, sovereign, self-governingcountry until it was invaded and conquered by the U.S. in1893, and subsequently annexed. Today it forms a substantialpart of our western frontier and is indispensable to ournational security. If native Hawaiians organized a Congress,proclaimed their independence, seceded from the union, andcalled loudly upon the world for recognition and support,what would our reaction be? What options would we have? Ithink you see the point.   A more promising course of action for the Lithuanianswould be to back down for now, be a &quot;good little state&quot; fortwo or three years, until the political and economic reformsare on a firmer footing.   Randall P. Shook   Boiling Springs, N.C.   ---   I will not believe that 61% of Americans would rathermaintain friendly ties with the murderous U.S.S.R. thansupport freedom for Lithuania. Something must have gone wrongwith the poll. I have not found a single person who agrees.   Americans who wave the flag and celebrate our Constitutionand the anniversary of our freedom should at least prefer tosupport freedom for the people of Lithuania, whose bondagethe U.S. has never recognized. Those same Americans should atleast question friendship with a nation that is guilty ofmurdering millions of its own and other people, and that hasantagonized and opposed the U.S. for more than 40 years. Thispoll, coming on the heels of Soviet admission of guilt forthe Katyn Forest massacre, reveals much about changingAmerican values.   A nation that can find nothing worth fighting for isdoomed.
