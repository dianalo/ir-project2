Tax talk by James Baker and Howard Baker riles administration conservatives. &quot;If the president signs off on significant taxes, there'll be a lot of screaming and shouting,&quot; says a White House aide. But despite the rhetoric, any tax bill accepted by the White House is likely to do little to reduce the red ink. Severe new taxes proposed by the House on takeovers also appear doomed.    Administration and congressional negotiators struggle just to reach the $24.8 billion of deficit reduction needed to head off automatic cuts. &quot;The trumpets blare and the headlines scream and, in the end, out will come a mouse,&quot; predicts one skeptical senator. But participants, aware that Wall Street is watching closely, vow to push for a significant compromise.    &quot;If we don't reach an agreement,&quot; says House Budget Chairman Gray, &quot;we risk another Black Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.&quot;    STOCK TURMOIL strengthens Reagan's hand for a trade-bill veto.    Thirty-eight Republican senators sign a letter to Reagan signaling that a veto would have strong support in the Senate. &quot;In light of events in the stock market this past week,&quot; the letter says, &quot;we wish to assure you once again, Mr. President, that we will oppose the enactment of protectionist legislation which would have adverse consequences on the U.S.&quot;    Treasury chief Baker could use a veto to gain concessions from West Germany and Japan on the dollar and economic policy. Opponents hope to scare Democrats away from even passing a trade bill. But Senate Finance Chairman Bentsen contends the bill's passage would &quot;help break down protectionism around the world and have a positive effect.&quot;    SUMMIT TALKS could be undercut by Gorbachev, U.S. officials worry.    The Soviet leader may use an expected December meeting with Reagan to turn up pressure against the Strategic Defense Initiative. After signing a pact eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe, Gorbachev could declare that further arms-control progress isn't possible until SDI development is limited, U.S. officials say.    If that happens, the long-sought summit &quot;could turn sour,&quot; one administration official warns. U.S. advisers insist Reagan will stand firm, while also pressing for cuts in long-range nuclear weapons. They credit the administration's tough bargaining with getting the Soviets to make concessions.    Some U.S. officials, concerned Gorbachev will captivate the media, are relieved his visit probably will be brief.    VIRTUE REWARDED: Ethical precautions save Greenspan up to $76,000. Before becoming Fed chief, he divested himself of bank-related stocks; they declined 26% when the market collapsed. But about 40 other stocks went into a blind trust and sank as much as $198,000, though some of them may have been sold, too.    REAGAN'S POLICIES in the Persian Gulf continue to get strong public support. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows 61% of Americans agree the U.S. should be protecting Kuwait's oil tankers against attacks from Iran. But 43% say they are &quot;very concerned&quot; that the situation will lead to a war between the U.S. and Iran.    DUKAKIS SUSTAINS his steady rise in support among likely Democratic voters after last month's flap over aides' role in forcing Biden out of the race. In the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 15% of such voters prefer Dukakis for president, about the same as 13% in a previous poll before Biden dropped out.    SORRY, HARRY: Simon builds much of his presidential campaign around being a Truman Democrat, but, as a young newspaper editor in 1948, he actually endorsed Dewey. Aides say that Simon, who was too young to vote at the time, chalks up his past preference to youthful inexperience.    RIVALS SCRAMBLE to counter Bush's strong debate showing in Houston.    Dole rushes back to Washington budget talks and curtails travel to underscore his role in managing the economic crisis. Kemp cancels a campaign trip to Kentucky to be on hand during budget decisions; he plans to emphasize the economy in a five-day swing in New Hampshire and Iowa. Du Pont tries to build on his aggressive debate showing to get attention in early voting states.    Democrats step up campaign efforts as well. Gephardt maps a farm offensive in rural Iowa. Babbitt sets speeches stressing environmental issues. Jackson plans to move his campaign headquarters to Chicago from Washington to be closer to Iowa. Democrats insist their candidates have stronger television presences than their GOP foes showed in Houston.    &quot;The Katzenjammer kids looked awful,&quot; Democratic strategist Robert Squier snipes at the GOP debaters. &quot;The dwarfs grew a foot.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: After the Secret Service retrieved a bag of its guns nearly left at the airport when Bush flew to Florida, an agent remarked: &quot;Good job. We'd have been the only ones in Miami without guns.&quot; . . . A Washington store displays a T-shirt with a picture of a vigorous-looking Nixon and the message &quot;He's tan, he's rested, he's ready for 1988.&quot; . . . Sponsors of a dinner for conservative American Spectator magazine include liberal Democrat Joseph Califano, but the former HEW secretary insists, &quot;I'm nobody's house liberal.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
