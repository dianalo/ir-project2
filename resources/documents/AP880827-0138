At least three other crewmen were believed still trapped insidethe damaged submarine, which was in 96 feet of water, butauthorities said the sailors were expected to be rescued Saturdaynight.   The submarine Pacocha sank after being accidentally rammedFriday evening by the Japanese fishing ship No. 8 Kyowa-Maru nearthe port city of Callao, the navy and the Japanese Embassy said.   Four people _ the commanding officer and three junior officers _were killed immediately after the crash and three crew membersremained unaccounted for, said navy spokesman Luis Castro.   Castro said 22 other crewmen were rescued as the vessel sankwhen they donned life preservers and jumped into the PacificOcean's frigid waters.   At least 21 others went down with the vessel and rescuers workedinto the night and through Saturday to free them. By late Saturday,all but three had been rescued.   Official navy accounts have varied as to the number of crewmembers on board the vessel when it collided with the fishing boat,the number who have not been accounted for and the number believedtrapped inside vessel.   Earlier, authorities said 52 sailors were on board the vesselwhen it collided with the fishing boat and that 24 were on boardwhen it sank.   But Castro's most recent count indicated that 50 people were onboard the ship and that 21 had been trapped.   On Saturday, rescuers used a diving bell that attached to thehatch of the submarine and began bringing crew members to thesurface from the submarine.   The bell, linked to the surface ship by a cable, was bringingcrew members up two at a time, Castro said.   Callao, Peru's largest port, is eight miles west of Lima. Porttraffic was banned until Monday to facilitate rescue operations,the port authority said Saturday.   Helicopters and navy rescue boats could be seen maneuvering offthe port, but officials refused to allow journalists into the area.   Castro said the 1,870-ton submarine, which was cruising on thesurface toward the port, sank shortly after being rammed on theleft stern side by the 412-ton, steel-hulled fishing boat.   There were no reported injuries on the fishing boat.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman who declined to be named said the U.S.Navy was sending a special team and equipment aboard three C-141transport planes to assist in the rescue operations.   The U.S. equipment includes a diving bell designed for submarinerescues, the official said. The Peru navy did not describe thediving bell already used in the rescue.   Sources close to the rescue said the trapped men were believedto be in the forward part of the submarine and had sealed thesection with hatch doors from the rest of the vessel, which isbelieved filled with water.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an airline running to the surface had been attached, giving survivors anunlimited supply of air.   The Peru navy said the submarine was purchased in 1974 from theU.S. government. The vessel, formerly the U.S.S. Atule, wascommissioned on June, 21, 1944, according to Jane's Fighting Ships.   The submarine sank shortly after impact, Castro said, adding hedid not know the extent of the damage to the craft.   Castro said divers working since 8 p.m. Friday made contact withcrewmen inside the sunken vessel.   The Callao port authority said the submarine was heading fornaval ship repair docks and the Japanese boat, carrying a crew of21, was leaving port to fish when the accident occurred.   The Japanese boat, skippered by Tsukasa Ohkado, suffered somecracks on the bow, the Japanese Embassy said Saturday.   The embassy said 16 of the Japanese boat's crew are Japanese andthe remaining five are Peruvians.</TEXT></DOC>
