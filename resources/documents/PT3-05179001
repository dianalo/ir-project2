Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates generally to infectious diseases and, more      particularly, to the diagnosis of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection      especially as associated with cystic fibrosis. </PAR><PAR>  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic syndrome among      Caucasians. In the United States, the incidence is 1 in 2,000 live births.      CF is a generalized metabolic disorder involving change in the serous and      mucous secretions resulting in, among other symptoms, progressive      obstructive pulmonary disease and malabsorption due to pancreatic enzyme      insufficiency. As late as the 1950's, life expectancy for cystic fibrosis      patients was extremely short. Even today, only half of CF patients reach      their 20th birthday. </PAR><PAR>  Pulmonary complications associated with progressive obstructive pulmonary      disease are responsible for the majority of morbidity and virtually all      mortality in afflicted patients. Pulmonary infections are generally a fact      of life for the CF patient. The majority of these infections are caused by      the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Once established      in CF patients, PA is an extremely difficult organism to eradicate. The      majority of CF patients are chronically infected with PA. </PAR><PAR>  Treatment of chronic PA infection with antibiotics, including the      aminoglycosides, generally fails to eradicate PA. Indeed, some researchers      believe that the continuous use of antibiotics actually contributes to the      bacteria's persistence. It is not uncommon to find patients infected with      PA strains resistant to all known antibiotics. These patients often have      an unrelenting deterioration of pulmonary function ultimately leading to      death. A recent study reported survival rates to age 16 years in CF      afflicted children with and without chronic PA infection. The researchers      reported a 53% survival rate in infected children versus an 84% survival      rate in non-infected children. </PAR><PAR>  Recent advances in the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections,      particularly PA infections, provide hope for CF patients with chronic PA      infections. Methods employing monoclonal antibody compositions, such as      those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 855,878, appear      particularly promising. Before any therapy can be effective, however it is      important to accurately diagnose the nature of the infection. Once      diagnosed, it is extremely beneficial to follow the effectiveness of      therapy throughout its course. There is therefore a need for compositions      and methods useful in the diagnosis of chronic PA infection and in      following the course of such infection. </PAR><PAR>  2.

No. 4,587,121 discloses the use of hyperimmune serum globulin      having high titers of antibody against all seven Fisher Immunotypes of      Pseudomonas aeruginosa for use in treating patients with Pseudomonas      infection. </PAR><PAR>  Rowe and Meadow, Eur.

The subject compositions comprise core      lipopolysaccharide derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAC 605,      especially antigenic determinants found on such core lipopolysaccharide.      The compositions are employed in diagnostic methodology such as enzyme      linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and Western blot assay. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention, the novel compositions are employed      because of their ability to bind immunoglobulin molecules (antibodies or      active fragments thereof) which bind antigenic determinants on      gram-negative bacteria. Donors of particular interest include human      patients afflicted with cystic fibrosis. Immunoglobulin molecules of      particular interest include human IgG molecules. </PAR><PAR>  According to the method of the present invention, the novel antigenic      determinant compositions are bound to a solid support and employed in a      variety of assay techniques well-known to the art, particularly ELISA.      Western blot analysis, or the like. Solid supports of particular interest      include a particle, e.g., bead, fiber, or the like, or container wall and      include materials such as nitrocellulose, cellulose, agarose, polystyrene,      dextran, glass, polymer coated magnetic metals, nylon, silica gel,      polyacrylamide, polymethyl, methacrylate, and the like, and of particular      interest is nitrocellulose (NC). </PAR><PAR>  The composition may be coupled directly to the support or via a spacer arm      to aid in preventing any possible charge or steric interferences with      antigen binding. Various spacer arms are available and well known in the      art. The ratio of antibody to support may be about 100:1 usually about      1,000:1 or higher. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention, kits are provided comprising      lipopolysaccharide derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAC 605      cells. These compositions may be provided in kit form bound to a solid      support and may include reagents employed in any of a variety of assay      techniques well known to those skilled in the art. These kits find      particular utility in diagnosing and monitoring chronic Pseudomonas      aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis patients. </PAR><PAR>  The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not      limitation. </PAR><PAC>  Experimental </PAC><PAC>  EXAMPLE I--MATERIALS AND METHODS </PAC><PAR>  1. LPS: PAC 605 bacterial strain (parent strain PAC1R, Habs 0:3) was      deposited on Sep. 27, 1985 with the American Type Culture Collection      (A.T.C.C.). Rockville, Md., Accession No. 53273. Cells were grown in a      aerated fermenter and LPS was extracted using the method described by      Darveau and Hancock, J. Bacteriology (1983) 155:831-38, which is      incorporated by reference. Coomasie blue dye protein assay (BIORAD)      measured a protein contamination of 1%. Purified J5 E. coli, Fisher type 1      PA, and Salmonella minnesota Ra LPS were purchased from LIST Biological      Laboratories. </PAR><PAR>  2. Anti-PA core LPS monoclonal antibody: XMMPS-605 (A.T.C.C. Accession No.      HB8909 is an IgG2b murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb). It was produced by      fusing spleen cells with SP2/0 myeloma cells following immunization with      killed PAC 605 cells. Hybrids were screened by using purified PAC 605 as      antigen. XXMPS-605 -is cross-reactive, binding to the core region of LPS      from all 7 Fisher types of PA. </PAR><PAR>  3. Patient sera: Normal human sera was donated by laboratory workers with      no history of PA infection or of working with PA organisms. Patient sera      was made available by the clinical laboratories of UCLA Center for the      Health Sciences, Los Angeles, Calif., and Pacific Medical Center, San      Francisco, Calif. Samples used were from excess serum obtained for routine      chemistry and antibiotic levels. </PAR><PAR>  4. IgG ELISA: An ELISA was developed and standardized to measure human IgG      titer against purified PAC 605 LPS. </PAR><PAR>  a) 25 .mu.l of PAC 605 LPS (500 .mu./ml in distilled water with 0.05%      triethylamine (TEA), boiled for 2 hours before use) and 25 .mu.l of 0.02M      MgCl.sub.2 with 0.05% TEA were added to triplicate wells of polystyrene      COSTAR 96-well EIA plates which were then covered and incubated overnight      at 37.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  b) Wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with      0.02M MgC.sub.2, pH 7.1. 100 .mu.l of 1% gelatin in PBS/MgCl.sub.2 was      then added to LPS coated wells and triplicate control wells and incubated      overnight at room temperature. </PAR><PAR>  c) The next day 50 .mu.l of human serum diluted serially in 0.1% gelatin in      PBS/MgCl.sub.2 was added to triplicate LPS coated and control wells and      incubated for one hour. All plates had positive test controls (XMMPS-605      20 .mu.g/ml) and negative test controls (pooled human serum from 4      volunteers, mixed just before use and diluted 1/640) added to triplicate      LPS coated and control wells. </PAR><PAR>  d) All wells were washed three times, then 50 .mu.l of Protein A-peroxidase      (BIORAD) diluted 1/10,000 in 0.1% gelatin in PBS/MgCl.sub.2 was added to      all wells and incubated for one hour. </PAR><PAR>  e) Wells were washed 5 times, then 100 .mu.l aliquots of ABTS substrate was      added to each well (per 5 ml: 4.9 ml 0.1M disodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5;      0.1 ml of 2.2'-azino-d-andlsqb;3-ethyl-benzthiazolinesulfonate {6}andrsqb; (BOEHRINGER      MANNHEIM), 20 mg/ml in citrate buffer; 5 .mu.l 30% H.sub.2 O.sub.2. </PAR><PAR>  f) Optical density (O.D.) was read on an automated microreader (BIOTEK or      FLOW LABORATORIES) when the O.D. of the positive plate control (XMMPS-605)      was close to 1.0. Results of triplicate test and control O.D.'s were      averaged. For a given test sample dilution, the mean control O.D, was      subtracted from the mean test O.D. A positive serum titer was defined as      that dilution yielding an O.D. greater than that of pooled human sera      diluted 1/640 (negative control) recorded on the same plate. </PAR><PAR>  5. Serum IgG levels: Patient and volunteer serum IgG levels were determined      by radial immunodiffusion, using KALLESTAD IgG Endoplates. KALLESTAD low,      medium, and high reference sera were used as controls. </PAR><PAR>  6. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: PAC 605 and J5 E. coli purified      LPS were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels with a discontinuous      buffer system as described by Hames, B. D., Gel electrophoresis of      Proteins: A Practical Approach, (1981) IRL Press, Oxford, England, P.      1-93. The separating gel contained 12.5% acrylamide/methylene      bisacrylamide (30.0/0.8) in Tris/SDS buffer, pH 8.8. The stacking gel      contained 4.5% acrylamide/methylene bisacrylamide in Tris/SDS buffer, pH      6.8. 350 .mu.g of LPS was boiled for 10 minutes in final sample buffer and      applied to a sample well. A lower molecular weight standard was applied to      a control well. Gels were electrophoresed at 8 mAmps overnight, then at 18      mAmps until the tracking dye reached the bottom. </PAR><PAR>  7. Electrophoretic transfer and immunoblot: Gels were immediately      transferred to nitrocellulose for three hours at constant amperage (190      mAmp) using the Western blot method of Towbin et al., Proc. Nat. Acad.      Sci. USA (1979) 76:4350-54. Molecular weight lanes were cut and stained      with amide black in acetic acid and methanol. The remainder of the sheet      was allowed to dry then stored at -20 degrees Centigrade until use. For      immunoassay of these blots, 0.5 cm strips were cut and blocked for 30      minutes in 1% gelatin in PBS. Individual strips were then incubated on a      rocker overnight with 4 ml of a 1/40 dilution of human serum in 0.1%      gelatin in PBS. Positive control strips for each blot were incubated with      either XMMPS-605, 20 .mu./ml, or rabbit anti-J5 E. coli serum, 1/40      dilution. The following day strips were washed for one hour with 4 changes      of PBS, then incubated in a 1/2000 dilution of Protein A-peroxidase, then      washed for one hour with 6 changes of PBS. Strips were developed with 4      chloro-1-naphthol substrate (per 5 ml: 4 ml PBS, 1 ml of 0.3% w/v 4      chloro-1-naphthol andlsqb;SIGMAandrsqb; in reagent grade methanol, 5 .mu.l 30% H.sub.2      O.sub.2).

Proteinase K digestion and periodate oxidation of LPS: To confirm that      bands seen on immunoblots of LPS represent non-protein, carbohydrate      determinants, 175 .mu.g of PAC 605 LPS was pre-digested with Proteinase K      (BRL) 1 mg/ml frozen stock added in a 1:10 v/v ratio to LPS in final      sample buffer and incubated overnight at 55 degrees Centigrade. An      additional aliquot of Proteinase K was added the next day and incubated      for three more hours. This digested LPS was fractionated in one half of an      SDS-polyacrylamide gel while an equal amount of undigested PAC 605 LPS was      fractionated on the other half. SDS-PAGE and Western blot were performed      as previously described. Strips containing digested and non-digested LPS      were immunoblotted with positive patient sera. </PAR><PAR>  Additional strips of blotted proteinase-treated PAC 605 LPS were oxidized      with periodic acid to destroy carbohydrate epitopes, then immunoassayed      using the same positive patient sera. Western blot strips of PAC 605 LPS      and control immunodots of Salmonella minnesota Ra LPS were blocked in 1%      gelatin in PBS, then bathed overnight at 4 degrees Centigrade in 50 mM      periodic acid, 50 mM acetic acid, pH5. After brief washing, strips and      control immunodots were immunoassayed as previously described. An IgG2a      MoAb specifically reactive with Salmonella Ra LPS was strongly reactive      against the control Ra immunodot but completely unreactive against the      periodate-oxidized Ra LPS dot. </PAR><PAR>  9. Silver stain: To confirm location of LPS bands, SDS-PAGE was done with      individual lanes containing PAC 605 LPS. J5 E. coli LPS and several other      PA LPS controls. This gel was then silver stained using the method      described by Hitchcock and Brown, J. Bacteriology (1983) 154:269-77, which      is incorporated by reference. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE II--RESULTS </PAC><PAR>  1. IgG ELISA: Results of the ELISA used to detect human IgG antibodies to      PAC 605 LPS are summarized in Tables 1, 2, and 3. </PAR><PAR>  Convalescent sera were available for 10 patients with documented PA      bacteremia. Five of these patients had documented localized infection      prior to the onset of bacteremia (pneumonia andlsqb;2andrsqb;, brain abscess andlsqb;1andrsqb;,      cystitis andlsqb;1andrsqb;, sinusitis andlsqb;1andrsqb;). The geometric mean titer of these 10      patients (obtained a minimum of seven days after blood cultures were      drawn) was 1/171 (range 1/40-1/1280). This did not differ significantly      from the geometric mean titer of sera from 5 normal volunteers (mean      1/211, range 1/160-1/320, pandgt;0.5, Student's test) or of convalescent sera      of 11 patients with documented non-PA enteric gram-negative bacteremia      (mean 1/97, range 1/40-1/320. pandgt;0.5). Blood culture isolates from this      latter group included E. coli (3), Klebsiella pneumonia (3), Enterobacter      cloacae (3), Proteus mirabilis (2), and Aeromonas hydrophila (1). </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 1                                                          ______________________________________                                         Geometric Mean IgG anti-PAC LPS Titers                                                 Number                                                                         of     Mean                                                                    patients                                                                              titer   Range       P value*                                    ______________________________________                                         PA bacteremia,                                                                           10       1/171   1/40-1/1280                                                                              p andgt; 0.5                                   convalescent                                                                   Non-PA    11       1/97    1/40-1/320                                                                               p andgt; 0.5                                   gram-negative                                                                  bacteremia,                                                                    convalescent                                                                   Cystic fibrosis                                                                          18       1/1808   1/320-1/10,000                                                                          p andlt; 0.001                                 Normal     5       1/211   1/160-1/320                                                                              p andgt; 0.5                                   volunteers                                                                     ______________________________________                                          *Student's t test                                                         </TBL><TBL>                TABLE 2                                                          ______________________________________                                         Paired Acute and Convalescent                                                  Mean IgG Anti-PAC 605 LPS Titers                                                       Number of                                                                      Patients                                                                               Acute   Convalescent                                                                              P value*                                    ______________________________________                                         PA bacteremia                                                                             6        1/143   1/160    p andgt; 0.5                                   Non-PA gram-                                                                             11        1/132   1/97     p andgt; 0.5                                   negative                                                                       bacteremia                                                                     ______________________________________                                          *Student's t test                                                         </TBL><PAR>  Paired acute and convalescent sera were available from 6 patients with PA      bacteremia and all 11 patients with non-PA gram-negative bacteremia.

The geometric mean titer of these      patients was significantly higher (mean 1/1808, range 1/320-1/10,000) than      the mean titer of normal volunteers (pandlt;0.001) and the mean convalescent      titer of patients with PA (pandlt;0.001) bacteremia. </PAR><PAR>  IgG Levels: Hypogammaglobulinemia was excluded as the reason for the      surprisingly low IgG anti-PAC 605 titer observed in convalescent sera of      PA bacteremic patients compared to uninfected normal volunteers. Serum IgG      levels were measured and compared. The mean IgG level of the 10 PA      bacteremic patients (1.118 mg/dl, range 640-1680 mg/dl) did not differ      significantly from the mean of 5 normal volunteers (1.236 mg/dl, range      1000-1380 mg/dl, pandgt;0.5). The CF patients' markedly higher IgG titer to PAC      605 LPS could have been a nonspecific artifact related to higher IgG      levels. To test this hypothesis, 9 of the 18 CF patients' sera were      randomly chosen and IgG levels were measured. The mean IgG level of these      9 patients was 1734 mg/dl, compared to 1118 mg/dl in the 10 PA bacteremic      patients--not a significant difference (pandgt;0.1). </PAR><PAR>  3. Western blots of PAC 605 LPS: In order to reveal the exact nature of the      PAC 605 LPS determinants bound by human IgG, whole SDS-polyacrylamide gels      were loaded with LPS, then fractionated by electrophoresis, then      transferred by the Western blot method to nitrocellulose (NC) sheets.      These sheets were cut into strips, incubated first with 1/40 patient sera,      then with Protein A-peroxidase and finally developed with substrate. All      data was confirmed by incubating the same test sera with a second strip      blotted from a different prep gel of PAC 605 LPS. Results are summarized      in Table 4. Several distinct band patterns were seen, and examples of each      pattern are shown in FIG. 1. As a positive control for each prep gel that      was blotted, the murine monoclonal IgG2a designated XMMPS-605 (which is      sensitive and specific for the core determinants of PAC 605 LPS) was      reacted with one NC strip. This reproducibly showed an intense broad band      between 10 kD and the dye front (see FIG. 1, lane A). No bands were      visible when pooled normal human sera or convalescent sera of patients      with PA bacteremia were incubated with strips of fractionated, blotted PAC      605 LPS. However 13 of 18 CF patients showed one of the following three      patterns. Five patients demonstrated a single broad core band between 10      kD and the dye front (same pattern as that shown by the anti-PA core LPS      monoclonal antibody XMMPS-605). Three patients showed a faint typical      smooth LPS ladder pattern between 30 and 50 kD. Five patients showed both      core and 30-50 kD ladder bands. One additional patient (RR) had a broad      core band in combination with two narrow intense bands at 14 kD and 24 kD.      When this immunoblot was repeated using PAC 605 LPS pretreated with      Proteinase K before electrophoresis, the 14 kD band disappeared suggesting      it represented a protein determinant. Only 4 of the 18 had a low molecular      weight core band and 8 of 18 had faint higher molecular weight ladder      bands. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 4                                                          ______________________________________                                         Western Blot Band Patterns of                                                  PAC 605 LPS and J5 E. coli LPS                                                            Cystic fibrosis                                                                           PA bacteremic                                            PAC 605 LPS                                                                               patient sera                                                                              convalescent sera                                                                           P value*                                    ______________________________________                                         Broad band 11/18      0/10         p andlt; 0.01                                    andlt;10 kD                                                                         Ladder bands,                                                                              8/18      0/10         p andlt; 0.05                                    30-50 kD                                                                       J5 E. coli LPS                                                                            11/17      3/9          p andgt; 0.1                                     Broad band                                                                     andlt;10 kD                                                                         ______________________________________                                          *Chi square with Yate's modification                                      </TBL><PAR>  4. Silver stain of PAC 605 LPS: The appearance of 30-50 kD ladder bands was      unexpected since PAC 605 LPS does not have smooth LPS. Several studies      were done to elucidate the nature of these bands. PAC 605 LPS and several      control purified LPS samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, then      silver-stained to exclude the possibility of contamination. Twenty-five      .mu.g of PAC 605 LPS run in a single lane (FIG. 2, lane E) showed an      intense core band from 10 kD to the dye front--the exact location of the      broad core band seen on Western blots reacted with both the anti-core MoAb      XXMPS-605 and with 11 of the 18 CF patient sera. There were narrow sharp      bands at 14 kD and 24 kD corresponding to the bands that occurred with CF      patient RR's sera. The band at 14 kD may represent a protein-LPS complex      since this band disappeared from RR's immunoblot when PAC 605 was      pre-treated with Proteinase K. No bands were seen between 30  and 50      kD--the location of faint ladder bands on Western blot strips. As a      control, Proteinase K digested boiled whole cells of a rough, non-typable      sputum PA isolate from one of the CF patients were fractionated in the      same gel (FIG. 2, lanes C and D). This apparently rough isolate has small      amounts of high molecular weight smooth LPS faintly detectable when      7.5.times.108 cells were run in lane C, and clearly visible when      1.5.times.109 cells were run in lane D. Another gel run by SDS-PAGE was      loaded with 25-125 .mu.g of PAC 605 LPS per well. Silver stain of the      overloaded wells showed a diffuse smear throughout the lane. Individual      ladder bands, however, were not visible. </PAR><PAR>  5. Proteinase K digestion and periodate oxidation of PAC 605 LPS:      Immunoblots were repeated to determine the exact nature of these high      molecular weight ladder bands. First PAC 605 LPS was pre-digested with      Proteinase K to destroy any protein determinants before fractionating by      SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. NC strips of blotted, Proteinase K-digested      LPS and untreated LPS were reacted with two CF patient s sera that had      previously shown ladder bands (FIG. 3, lanes A and C). Ladder bands      remained visible after Proteinase K treatment, suggesting the bands are      not due to protein epitopes. Several of these LPS strips were then      oxidized overnight with periodic acid, pH 5, to destroy carbohydrate      determinants, as described by Caldwell and Hitchcock, Infect. Immun.      (1984) 44:306-14, which is incorporated by reference, and then reacted      with the same CF patient's serum. Ladder bands disappeared after periodate      oxidation, suggesting that the responsible determinants are located on      repeating polysaccharide units of smooth LPS. </PAR><PAR>  6. Western blots of J5 E. coli LPS: If the core determinants of PAC 605 LPS      are very similar to those of the cross-reactive core of enteric      gram-negative bacilli (i.e. purified J5 E. coli LPS), then the difference      in IgG anti-PA core LPS response between CF and convalescent PA bacteremic      patients may just be a reflection of a difference in cross-reactive IgG      anti-gram-negative core titer. To test this hypothesis, J5 E. coli LPS was      fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted onto NC sheets. Individual NC      strips were immunoassayed with sera from 17 CF patients and 9 convalescent      PA bacteremic patients. All results were confirmed by incubating the same      test serum with a second strip blotted from a different prep gel of J5      LPS. Eleven of 17 CF sera versus 3 of 9 convalescent PA bacteremic sera      showed core bands below 14 kD (pandgt;0.1, Chi square with the Yates      modification). These core bands were in the same location that      immunoblotted rabbit anti-J5 LPS appeared on silver stain (FIG. 2, lane      B). Hence it was highly unlikely that the difference between CF patients      and convalescent PA bacteremic patients in IgG anti-PA core LPS response      was simply due to cross-reactive antibodies to the common endotoxic core      of enteric gram-negative bacilli. </PAR><PAR>  As may be appreciated from the foregoing, the present invention provides      those skilled in the art with novel compositions and methods useful in the      diagnosis and monitoring of P. aeruginosa infections.
