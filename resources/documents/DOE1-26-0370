One method of improvementis by insulation, but if the wall faces approximately south, it is possiblethat greater benefits could be obtained by improving the wall's performanceas a solar collector. Three solid 225 mm walls were constructed: oneglazed, one unglazed, and one waterproofed unglazed wall. Two glazedcavity walls were also constructed one glazed with a fan to recover heatfrom the cavity by forced convection, and one unglazed, with no fan.These walls gave small heat gains. The walls behind the glazing werethan insulated on their outer faces, and warm air collected by naturalconvection. Such a collector was built using a selective surface, a maximumefficiency of about 50% was observed. A theoretical model was developedbased on simple steady state theory, this was found to correlate wellwith experimental data. The theory could be used for any system of lowthermal storage, including forced flow collectors. Finally, these walls,and others, are compared and their relative merits discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
