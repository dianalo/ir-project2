DTC, by a letter dated January5, 1989, extended the time for the Commission to take action on the proposaluntil February 15, 1989. This order approves the proposal on a pilot basisfor a period of 90 days.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26344 (December 7,1988), 53 FR 50145 (December 13, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description of the Proposal</ITAG>The proposed rule change will implement ATOP, which will further automatethe manner in which tender and exchange offers can be processed throughDTC's facilities. ATOP will permit DTC participants to transmit electronicallyto a bidder's agent through DTC acceptance of a tender or exchange offercontemporaneously with delivery of securities on deposit at DTC that theparticipant intends to tender.Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-14 requires most tender or exchange agents to establisha book-entry account at qualified securities despositories for deliveryof securities from participants in those depositories who wish to tendersecurities under the terms of the offer.\3\<NOTE/> DTC is a qualified securities depository for purposes ofRule 17Ad-14.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See</T3> 17 CFR 240.17Ad-14 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20581 (January 19, 1984),49 FR 3064.DTC's current service for processing tender and exchange offers enableparticipants to submit written instructions to delivery, by book-entrymovement, securities to the tender or exchange agent's account in satisfactionof the terms or exchange agent's account in satisfaction of the terms ofthe offer. To authorize DTC to surrender securities on the participant'sbehalf, a participant must submit two hardcopy documents to DTC. The firstdocument, a DTC Voluntary Offering Instruction (``VOI''), authorizes DTCto deduct the securities from the participant's account and deliver themby book-entry to a special account maintained at DTC on behalf of the agent.The second document is a letter of transmittal, the terms of which areprepared by the bidder and which the participant obtains from the bidderor its representatives. The participant signs the letter of transmittaland submits it to DTC. DTC then forwards the letter of transmittal anda copy of the VOI to the agent. If the shares are accepted by the agent,DTC makes arrangements with the agent to receive cash or securities whichit will allocate to the accounts of the appropriate participants. A participantmay submit multiple VOI forms and letters of transmittal authorizing upto the total quantity of target shares in the participant's DTC account.Currently, a participant may also accept an offer through the agent andsubsequently surrender those securities through DTC. The participant cansubmit a letter of transmittal or other documentation, sometimes calleda ``notice of guaranteed delivery'' or a ``protect letter'' directly tothe agent and later submit a VOI form, along with a copy of the letterof transmittal, to DTC. This procedures allows the participant to surrendersecurities through DTC during the offer protection period, if any, (<T3>i.e., </T3>the period after the expiration date of the offer duringwhich securities may be surrendered pursuant to a notice of guaranteeddelivery submitted prior to the expiration date).ATOP will eliminate the submission of the hardcopy VOI and letter of transmittalby a participant to DTC by allowing the participant to make the same instructionselectronically through DTC's Participant Terminal System (``PTS'').\5\<NOTE/> To accept an offer through ATOP, a participant will sendan ATOP instruction to DTC through its PTS terminal. The ATOP instructionwill contain the same information currently contained in the hardcopy VOIform. In addition, the ATOP instruction will contain a special field inwhich the participant will acknowledge that it has received the letterof transmittal (as prepared by the bidder or its agent) and that the participantagrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal.\6\<NOTE/> The participant will also be able to enter in the ATOP instructioncharacters responding to any special representations that are requirtedby the terms of the offer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ DTC's PTS allows participants to communicate with DTCthrough a computer terminal in the participant's office. Participants usePTS to send instruction, inquiries and other messages to DTC and to DTCand to receive messages and reports from DTC. <T3>See</T3> File No. SR-DTC-76-8, Securities Exchange Act Release No.20519 (Dec. 30, 1984), 49 FR 966.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ ATOP will not charge current practices regarding the preparationand distribution of tender and exchange offer materials. Bidders will continueto prepare and distribute the same hardcopy offer materials, includingletters of transmittal, as it does now, and distribute them to Participantsand other who do not use DTC's facilities to accept offers.DTC will check some of the data in the ATOP instruction, verifying, forexample, that the participant has correctly identified a current offerand the target securities. DTC also will reject any ATOP instruction inwhich the participant has failed to enter the leter of transmittal acknowledgement.if the participant does not have sufficient securities in its DTC accountat the the ATOP instruction is submitted, the ATOP instruction will recycleuntil sufficient securities are present. If the participant does not havesufficient securities in its account by the end of the day, the ATOP instructionwill not be processed.If the participant has sufficient securities in its DTC account, DTC willdeduct the specified securities from the participant's account and addthem to the agent's account. At the same time, DTC will automatically generatehardcopy messages reflecting this transaction on the PTS printers in theoffices of the participant and the agent. A participant will receive onemessage for each instruction sent by the participant. The agent will receiveone message for each instruction sent by a participant.DTC will send the agent a receipt and confirmation report summarizing theday's activities in each particular offer at the end of each business daythe offer is open. The agent also will be able to review information aboutthe offer throughout the day on its PTS terminal.Each participant using ATOP has agreed with DTC to be bound by DTC's ParticipantOperating Procedures. Those procedures, as they relate to ATOP, will providethat any participant sending DTC an ATOP instruction containing the letterof transmittal acknowledgment agrees to be bound by the terms of the relatedletter of transmittal and agrees that the bidder in the offer may enforcethe participant's agreement (and agreement to the terms of the offer) directlyagainst the participant.Under DTC's current service, each agent enters into an agreement with DTCcovering a number of matters relating to the service. The ATOP agreementbetween the agent and DTC will contain provisions to the effect that DTC'sdelivery of an ATOP message to the agent (<T3>i.e.,</T3> by printing the message on the agent's PTS printer) willhave the same legal effect as the execution and delivery of a letter oftransmittal by the participant identified in the agent's message; thatsuch agreement is enforceable against the bidder by the participant; andthat the agent is authorized to make such agreement on behalf of the bidder.DTC will operate ATOP as a pilot program with its participants and a fewhigh volume tender and exchange agents with PTS terminals. DTC plans toexpand the program as it gains operating experience and expects eventuallyto include lower volume exchange and tender agents that do not have PTSterminals. DTC, however, will continue to offer the current hardcopy servicealong with ATOP for those exchange and tender agents that wish to continueto rely on written letters of transmittal.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ At a later date, and subject to approval under section19(b) of the Act, DTC expects to expand the type of information availableto the participant. DTC plans to eventually allow a participant to sendan instruction that would serve as a notice of guaranteed delivery. Theparticipant would send such an instruction when it does not have the securitiescredited to its DTC account but anticipates receiving the securities ona later day. The Participant would send another instruction to surrenderthe securities in the offer when it receives them.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. DTC's Rationale</ITAG>DTC states that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirementsof the Act and the rules thereunder applicable to DTC. Specifically, DTCbelieves that the proposed enhancement to DTC's tender and exchange offerservices is consistent with the requirement to safeguard securities andfunds in DTC's custody or control or for which it is responsible undersection 17A of the Act.DTC also states that ATOP will alleviate problems arising from use of hardcopydocuments in tender and exchange offers, such as the risk of loss, delayduring shipment and the expense and labor involved in the physical handlingof documents. In addition, ATOP will provide agents for tender and exchangeoffers with an improved ability to control the processing of such offersby making a variety of information available to the agent (and to the bidder)while an offer is open.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with section 17Aof the Act in that it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlementof securities transactions. ATOP will bring to DTC's tender and exchangeoffer processing service the benefits and efficiencies of automation, includingdecreased risk of loss, reduced costs to participants and a later cut-offdate for the submission of instructions.The principal benefit of ATOP may be a reduction in the paperwork associatedwith tender and exchange offers. Currently, reams of paper must be shuffledamong participants, DTC and the agents using the mails, overnight deliveryservices and facsimile transmissions.ATOP may also allow DTC to extend its deadlines for accepting an offerthrough DTC. Currently, because of the delay in shipping letters of transmittalfrom participants to DTC and then from DTC agents (which are frequentlylocated outside New York), DTC in many cases can accept letters of transmittalonly up to a certain time prior to the expiration date of the offer. UnderATOP, DTC will be able to accept the VOI and letter of transmittal fromparticipants through PTS for a period much closer to the expiration dateof the offer. This will allow participants more time to receive their customer'sinstructions to tender or exchange securities.The Commission agrees with DTC that ATOP should begin as a pilot. A 90-daypilot should provide DTC with the operational experience to make any necessaryadjustments to its operational procedures. DTC has not finalized the proceduresfor ATOP but expects to do so prior to the expiration of the pilot period.DTC will include ATOP procedures when it files a proposed rule change pursuantto Rule 19b-4 for permanent approval of ATOP.The Commission notes that DTC's proposal will provide, in essence, facilitiesfor communications between agents and participants. Although Exchange ActRule 17Ad-14 requires agents to establish accounts with DTC because DTCis a qualified securities depository, nothing in that rule currently<T3> requires</T3> agents to participate in ATOP or to accept ATOP transmittalsabsent an agreement to do so.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed in this order, the Commission finds that theproposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly section17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.<T3>It is therefore ordered,</T3> pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act,that the proposed rule change (SR-DTC-88-19) be, and hereby is, approvedon a pilot basis for a period of 90 days from the date below.For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegatedauthority.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
