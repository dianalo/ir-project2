(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL evangelist Jim Bakker was convictedThursday of using his television show to defraud followers of $3.7million, money the jury foreman said corrupted a minister whostarted out to do good.   ``He was called by God. But eventually the money became too muchfor him,'' said foreman Ricky Hill, who said during jury selectionthat he was a Christian. ``We kept looking for something from thedefense and we never saw it.''   Bakker faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and $5million in fines. The U.S. District Court jury convicted him of all24 counts in the indictment, which charged he oversold lodgingguarantees, called ``lifetime partnerships,'' at his Heritage USAreligious retreat.   The government said 152,903 partnerships were sold, producing$158 million.   ``The message is you can't lie to the people and use televisionand the mails to get them to send you money,'' said prosecutorDeborah Smith. ``It doesn't matter who you are or how well knownyou are, you simply can't do it.''   Defense lawyer George C. Davis said the verdict would beappealed.   Prosecutors said Bakker diverted $3.7 million in ministry fundsfor personal use while knowing PTL was in financial trouble. Heused money from PTL for vacation homes in California and Florida, alakefront parsonage, a houseboat, Rolls-Royce and Mercedes cars andmore peculiar luxuries such as an air-conditioned doghouse.   Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, said she and her husband would returnto Orlando, Fla., where they moved the die-hard remnants of theirministry.   ``It's not over until it's over,'' added Mrs. Bakker during anews conference after the verdict. Hundreds of Bakker faithful andthe lunchtime curious flocked around the courthouse, and Mrs.Bakker serenaded them with a verse of ``On Christ, the solid rock,I stand. All other ground is sinking sand.''   Bakker was freed later Thursday on $250,000 bond imposed by U.S.District Court Judge Robert Potter. The judge set sentencing forOct. 24.   ``I'm going to keep my faith in God and I'm going to go seeTammy now. I feel sad but encouraged in God,'' Bakker said, smilingin a brief midafternoon statement to reporters. He said he was``still innocent of the charges against me.''   Potter said he granted bond reluctantly because Bakker faithfulhad a ``Jim Jones mentality'' and might help him flee the country.   ``They think he could walk on water,' Potter said.   Davis declared the reference to the 1978 murder-suicide of 900followers of Jim Jones' cult in Jonestown, Guyana, ``horrible,absolutely uncalled for.''   Bakker showed little emotion as the verdict was read. Tearswelled in the eyes of Mrs. Bakker, who also received large bonusesfrom PTL but was not charged with any crimes.   The jury foreman said he was unswayed by Bakker's testimony, inwhich he defended his earnings as reasonable for someone who raisedmillions of dollars for the work of the Lord.   ``He was a man of God. He got corrupt and I feel sorry for theman,'' Hill said. He said that in the day and a half of jurydeliberations, ``The most disagreement was when the fraud started.''   Trial testimony showed PTL paid $265,000 to Jessica Hahn tocover up the sexual encounter with Bakker that led to hisresignation fom PTL in 1987.   ``I'm sorry I don't have a song to sing like Tammy but I knowthis is God's amazing grace,'' Ms. Hahn said in a statement afterthe conviction.   ``I don't feel sad for what happened to Bakker,'' she said.``I'd like to look him in the eye and tell him, `Get out therowboat, you can't walk on water.'   ``This is going to go down in history as saying, `you can toucheven the mightiest of men who are armed with Bibles, white collarsand microphones,'' she said. ``Today's verdict is not attackingGod, but the people who are abusing God.''   Reaction to the conviction varied among trial spectators.   ``I think it's wonderful,'' said Beverly Sparrow. ``He deserveseverything he's going to get.''   ``My faith was that he would be set free on all charges,'' saidBill Fisher of Fort Mill, S.C. ``I still believe he will.''   The trial started Aug. 28 and was interrupted Aug. 31 whenBakker didn't come to court. His attorneys told the judge Bakkerwas in a fetal position with his head under a couch.   After a brief hearing about the emotional collapse, Potterordered Bakker sent to a prison psychiatric ward. He was declaredfit to resume the trial Sept. 6.   A key to the government's case was the sale of about 153,000partnerships between 1984 and 1987. The partnerships typicallypromised three free nights' stay annually for life in exchange fora $1,000 donation, and Bakker testified that there was room for211,000 partners. Government evidence showed that Bakker had only258 rooms available.   Several partners testified they were never able to use thelodging Bakker had promised. Bakker's former second-in-command,Richard Dortch, indicated in his testimony that Bakker knew he wasmaking false promises.   Dortch, 57, pleaded guilty in a plea bargain to two counts ofwire fraud and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy. He wasgiven an eight-year prison term and fined $200,000.</TEXT></DOC>
