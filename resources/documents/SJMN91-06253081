Although Sovietimmigrants in the center of the country face a desperate shortage of housing,not enough of them have moved to Arad to fill the 1,700 units nearingcompletion -- much less the 2,500 more soon to be started.;   Even if theSoviets were here, Mayor Bezalel Tabib said, there would be no place for themto work, because Israeli and foreign companies have little interest ininvesting in a town of 15,000 people in the desert mountains, a hundred milesor more by two-lane road from major ports or markets.;   The prospect of aghost town here illustrates why Israel's effort to absorb its huge wave ofimmigration is threatened with economic catastrophe -- and why the governmentof Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has grown desperate to win the support of theU.S. Congress and the Bush administration for a U.S.-backed, $10 billionbailout.;   Experts forecast problems; When the Soviet immigration began twoyears ago, Israeli, American and European financial experts warned Shamir thatIsrael could successfully absorb the sudden flood of new population only if itopened its markets to private and foreign investment.;   Nevertheless, theseexperts say, Shamir's government has responded to the influx in classicsocialist fashion, launching massive, state-run housing and job programs inwhich political and nationalist priorities -- such as settling the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip -- have taken precedence over economic criteria.;  Now, the economic costs of the government's approach are beginning to comehome. Even as the state spends billions of dollars to build tens of thousandsof public housing units, housing prices in central Israel are soaring.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Arad, Israel  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910909  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  392  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 9, 199100253081,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
