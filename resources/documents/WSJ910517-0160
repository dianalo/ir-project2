The gulf is evident in question after question on thelatest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, with black votersconsistently offering what pollsters Peter Hart and RobertTeeter, who conducted the survey, call &quot;a far morepessimistic&quot; vision about the state of affairs in the U.S.and the prospects for the future.</LP><TEXT>   For example, white voters say by a 2-1 margin thatrelations between whites and blacks have gotten better overthe past five years -- while black voters say by the samemargin that relations have gotten worse. Nearly seven out of10 white voters believe blacks are better off than they werea decade ago; fewer than half of black voters agree.   The Journal/NBC poll was one of four special surveysconducted each year that examines a specific topic in depth.This one focused largely on social issues -- but it found thesame sharp divergences on other topics as well. &quot;The sharpestdifferences between any demographic groups on most all thequestions on this poll having to do with economic or domesticissues are between white and black voters,&quot; say Mr. Hart, aDemocrat, and Mr. Teeter, a Republican.   For example, 40% of white voters believe the economy willget better in the next year, while 19% think it will getworse; among black voters, 41% think it will get worse and18% think it will get better. Nearly eight in 10 whites, butfewer than half of blacks, believe the war with Iraq wasworth it.   And while only 10% of white voters think President Bush'shealth problems will affect his ability to perform his job asvigorously as in the past, 22% of black voters think it will.   The poll did find some areas of consensus between blackand white voters, even on sensitive racial issues. Forinstance, 57% of all voters -- including a majority of whitesand more than eight in 10 blacks -- say they approve ofaffirmative-action programs in business for blacks and otherminority groups.   Moreover, 78% of all voters believe poverty has gottenworse in the U.S. over the past decade, and 65% -- with 61%of whites and 88% of blacks -- believe the federal governmentis spending too little to combat the problem.   But for the most part, black and white voters expresssharply different opinions. For instance, the Journal/NBCsurvey found that 70% of black voters think blacks arediscriminated against in this society, while only a quarterof white voters think so. Half of white voters think blacksare treated fairly, while only 22% of black voters think so.And one out of five whites believes that blacks are getting&quot;too many special advantages,&quot; while only 2% of blacks agree.   Whites tend to be similarly skeptical that Hispanics andAsian-Americans are discriminated against; majorities believethey are receiving fair treatment. Majorities of blacksbelieve that Hispanics are subject to discrimination butAsian-Americans aren't; nearly one in five black votersthinks Asian-Americans receive &quot;too many special advantages.&quot;   Several public-opinion specialists say they aren'tsurprised at the differing world views of the two groups.Linda Williams, a visiting fellow at Harvard University whohas written widely on black political issues, saysdifferences are often most pronounced on &quot;economic issues andthe role of government.&quot; She adds: &quot;It's somewhatunderstandable, given that blacks and whites live in twodifferent Americas and live two different experiences.&quot;   Julian Bond, a longtime civil-rights activist who is now avisiting professor at American University here, says blackAmericans are more likely to see government as &quot;a positive,helpful force&quot; because many of them &quot;have seen governmentmake an enormous difference in their lives. . . . Governmenteliminated discrimination in the ballot box, government endedsegregation.&quot;   Many whites, he says, &quot;have been told, and believe, thatthe only time government tried to help poor people itfailed.&quot; Thus, he says, &quot;it's natural for whites to say&quot; thatgovernment intervention &quot;can't work, it didn't work, it won'twork; black folks are likely to say it did work, it can workand it will work.&quot;   Black and white voters show less difference on some of themore explosive social issues that divide the rest of America,such as abortion. Both groups, for example, are sharplydivided internally over the question of whether theypersonally believe abortion is wrong. Nationwide, 44% say yesand 46% no; among whites it is 43% yes and 47% no, whileamong blacks it is 50% yes and 38% no.   At the same time, strong majorities in both groups believethat abortions shouldn't be banned. Among all voters, 60% sayabortion shouldn't be made illegal, while 31% say it shouldbe.   Similarly, strong majorities of all voters favor a lawthat would require companies to give employees as much asthree months unpaid leave to take care of a newborn or carefor a seriously ill family member, even if the law increasedcosts to businesses. Among all voters, 72% favor such a law,while 23% oppose it. Although the White House has opposedsuch a mandatory-leave law, the poll found that 64% ofRepublicans support it.   When voters are asked which of the two political partiescomes closest to their views on a variety of social issues,Democrats lead by 28% to 21% on abortion and by 30% to 16% onfamily-leave policy. Sentiment on gun control is split, with27% saying Democrats and 28% saying Republicans. But the GOPhas a 32%-16% lead on the issue of the death penalty.   In addition, a racial difference re-emerges on thedeath-penalty issue. While 74% of white voters favor thedeath penalty and only 16% oppose it, among blacks only 47%favor it, 34% oppose it and 19% aren't sure. Among allvoters, the death penalty is endorsed by 71% and opposed by18%.   Blacks and whites also disagree sharply about the role ofthe federal government in assisting minorities. Despite thegeneral support for affirmative-action programs, only 39% ofwhites say the government should make special efforts toimprove the social and economic position of blacks and otherminorities to correct past discrimination, while 46% say thefederal government shouldn't make any special efforts andthese groups should help themselves. Black voters favor such&quot;special efforts&quot; by 82% to 11%.   Similarly, the two groups are at odds over whether moreanti-discrimination laws are needed on the books. Fifty-ninepercent of blacks say current laws should be toughenedbecause they don't protect minorities well enough; only 14%of whites agree. At the other end of the spectrum, 39% ofwhites think existing laws have &quot;gone too far&quot; and resultedin &quot;reverse discrimination&quot;; 20% of blacks agree.   Neither black nor white voters have strong views about thepending civil-rights bill that has stirred intensecontroversy in Washington: 77% of all voters and 66% ofblacks are unfamiliar with the measure. Among the smallnumbers who had heard of it, most thought it wouldn't affecttheir jobs.   Whites and blacks were also united on one somewhat ominousnote. Majorities of both groups -- 56% of whites and 66% ofblacks -- believe that the kind of racial disturbances thatoccurred in the 1960s could happen again now.</TEXT></DOC>
