For itsintroduction, a careful planning and design is necessary by calculatingthe quantitative economic points. Considerable points are: (1) Supplyand demand balance of power and heat. (2) Economy of equipment and operation.(3) Installation space and system of operation and control. (4) Relatedregulations and laws. This report describes on a program for the decisionmaking for the introduction of the system, not on the design programfor the equipment specification. Features of the economic evaluationmethod are as follows: (1) Evaluation of energy supply and demand pertime. (2) Consideration on the dynamic characteristics of the equipments.(3) Automatic calculation of tariffs of electricity and gas. (4) Calculationof equipment cost by a unit price curve of various heat source units.(5) Preparation of energy load patterns per building and the application.(6) Standardization of a print format.
