Barranquilla is well known in drug-trafficking circles as thejumping-off point for much of the Colombian cocaine that issmuggled into the United States.   The army headquarters in Barranquilla said in a communiquebroadcast by the radio network RCN that five hotel employees and aguest were injured in the blast. A suspect reportedly was arrested,RCN said, quoting police sources.   In other developments, two more mid-level drug traffickingsuspects were arrested and being held for extradition to the UnitedStates, Colombia's federal police said, and judges demanding moreprotection from traffickers ended a strike.   The national radio network Caracol, meanwhile, reported thatauthorities took about 2,000 Bogota emerald dealers in forquestioning following last week's slayings of seven dealers inQuipama, a town 60 miles north of Bogota.   Authorities arrested several detained dealers and confiscatedsome small arms, Caracol said. It said the detentions were intendedto prevent more violence among dealers vying for control of emeraldmines in Boyaca state.   A Bogota police spokeswoman said she could not confirm thedetentions.   In the last two months, 22 people have died as a result ofbattles for control of the mines.   The drug suspects were identified by Colombian national policeas Robert James Sokolowski and Nelson Cuevas Ramirez. Both werearrested Thursday, Sokolowski in Cerrejon and Cuevas Ramirez inCartagena, police said.   The Justice Department in Washington said Sokolowski wasactually Robert Sokol Jr., 29, who is wanted on a 1984 federalindictment in Greensboro, N.C., on conspiracy to distribute cocaine.   Colombian police said Cuevas Ramirez, 55, is wanted by a NewYork federal court on charges of possession of cocaine andconspiracy to distribute the drug.   Four drug traffickers already have been extradited to the UnitedStates to face trial. The latest arrest brings to six the number ofColombians awaiting extradition on drug-related charges in theUnited States.   None of the leaders of Colombia's cocaine cartels however havebeen arrested since President Virgilio Barco announced hiscrackdown Aug. 18 on traffickers following the assassination of aleading presidential candidate.   Although judges ended a three-day strike for protection fromdrug barons, they said their demands were not met and they have notreceived any of the $19 million in security aid promised byWashington.   The judges threatened to strike again if the government does notprovide bulletproof vests, bulletproof cars and bodyguards.   The government has promised for next week 25 motorcycles forguards, 72 bulletproof vests and 14 metal detectors, a lawyer withthe union told The Associated Press on Friday.   On Nov. 30, 50 bulletproof cars will be turned over to judgeswho face the most danger from the traffickers, said the lawyer,Gregorio Oviedo. All of the promised equipment is Colombian, hesaid.   Oviedo said, however, the equipment will cover just 2 percent ofthe judges who have received death threats from drug traffickers.   The only protection given the country's 5,000 judges so far were40 bulletproof vests delivered as part of a $65 million U.S.military aid package for fighting traffickers, Oviedo said.   But the vests weighed 45 pounds and were returned because theywere so heavy and many of the lighter-framed judges were barelyable to walk around with them on, the lawyer said.   The bomb in Barranquilla, placed in a Renault sedan, brokealmost all the windows in the front of the 16-story Royal Hotel,fire chief Horacio Blanco told the RCN radio network. Several carsalso were damaged, he said.   A bomb Sept. 25 in the Hilton Hotel in another Caribbean city,Cartagena, killed two people.   As in the Cartagena bombing, no one claimed responsibility forthe Barranquilla explosion.   Since the crackdown began, 165 bomb blasts have killed 16 peopleand injured 201.   The federal and municipal judges and 12,000 other court workerswent on strike Tuesday, hours after a federal judge was murdered inMedellin.   Drug traffickers claimed responsibility and said the judge waskilled in retaliation for the extradition to the United States ofdrug trafficking suspects.   In the last 12 years, 221 Colombian court workers, including 42judges, have been killed, many by traffickers.   The daily El Tiempo reported Friday that a lawyer representingthe Medellin cocaine cartel contacted the country's leading leftistpresidential candidate two weeks ago.   The candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo of the leftist Patriotic Unionparty, and the lawyer met at Jaramillo's house, El Tiempo said. Thelawyer, who was not identified, made a plea for contacts betweenJaramillo's party and the traffickers, the daily quoted Jaramilloas saying.   Former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen said Thursday theUnited States should give $500 million a year to Colombia to fightdrug traffickers, noting Washington spends millions ``to stop theadvance of communism'' in El Salvador and Nicaragua.</TEXT></DOC>
