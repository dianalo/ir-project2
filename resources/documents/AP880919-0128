But South African clergymen who met the pontiff at the end ofhis pilgrimage said he should have spoken out more forcefullyagainst apartheid.   John Paul's 49th foreign trip, which took him to five nations,was marked by a forced landing in South Africa, a deadly bushijacking in Lesotho and a papal appeal for aid to victims ofMozambique's drought and civil war.   In a misty-eyed departure speech at Maputo Airport inMozambique, the pope decried the ``scandalous poverty'' of theregion and the ``painful violations of elementary rights of eachman,'' a reference to South Africa's racial policies.   Speaking of the hunger in Mozambique, the pope described ``theworried gaze of so many children, the uncertain look of so manyyouths (and) the weary eyes of so many adults.''   He also appealed to ``all those who have politicalresponsibilities'' in the region to settle their differencespeacefully.   Six days before the pope visited Mozambique, South AfricanPresident P.W. Botha held a surprise meeting with his Mozambiquecounterpart, Joaquim Chissano, to revive a 1984 non-aggression pactand jointly develop energy sources and tourism.   Chissano, a Marxist, said the pope had seen for himself ``thesigns of good will to overcome the crisis.''   Civil war has left 6 million of Mozambique's 14.5 million peoplein need of foreign food aid, and John Paul said he felt ``the heartof the people bleed.''   ``This nation needs assistance from other peoples ... to save alarge amount of human lives,'' the pope said.   Activist clergymen from South Africa, who on Monday attended apapal Mass in Mozambique, said John Paul should have spoken outmore forcefully against apartheid during his tour of the region.   On Wednesday, John Paul made an unscheduled stop in SouthAfrica, where his plane was diverted in bad weather, forcing him totravel by road to Lesotho.   The pope ``had given the South African government more comfortthan it deserved,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of theWorld Alliance of Reformed Churches. He spoke to reporters after heand other Protestant clergy from South Africa joined Mozambicanchurch leaders at a meeting with John Paul.   During his pilgrimage, John Paul condemned all violence, butsuggested he was not enthusiastic about anti-apartheid strategiessuch as economic sanctions and election boycotts.   Boesak said the three-hour papal stop in Johannesburg was apropaganda coup for South African authorities, who had complainedabout the omission of their country from the official itinerary.   South Africa's foreign minister, Pik Botha, greeted the pope,ordered a security force escort for a motorcade to Lesotho, andlater boasted about South Africa's hospitality.   ``Anyone who enters into dialogue with the South Africangovernment must be aware that they are going to use you for theirown purposes,'' Boesak said.   One of Boesak's colleagues, the Rev. Frank Chikane, said thepope had met with officials who ``hurt us and cause us pain'' andhad been escorted by ``people who torture us.''   Chikane is secretary general of the South African Council ofChurches, which is leading a civil disobedience campaignchallenging emergency regulations and apartheid laws.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.   During his nine-hour return flight to Rome, John Paul sent hisfirst public message in at least five years to Libyan leaderMoammar Gadhafi, whose country has no diplomatic relations with theVatican.   The pope, who flew over the Libyan coastal city of Benghazi,sent a telegram extending ``good wishes for the peace andwell-being of the peoples of the Jamahiriya,'' the name thegovernment has used for Libya since Gadhafi took power in a 1969coup.   The pontiff began his trip in Zimbabwe, where he attended aconference of southern African bishops. Just before the papal planelanded in Botswana, topless women dancing at the airport inGabarone were told to cover themselves.   In Swaziland, the pope stressed the virtues of monogamy at aMass attended by 20-year-old King Mswati II and three of his fourwives.   The pope's visit to tiny Lesotho was the most dramatic of hispilgrimage. The night before he arrived, rebels hijacked apilgrims' bus carrying nuns and schoolchildren to see the pope. Sixpeople were killed when South African soldiers stormed the bus toend the 27-hour ordeal.</TEXT></DOC>
