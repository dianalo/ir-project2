Frederick Wolf, head of the GAO's accounting division, told a House subcommittee yesterday that the FSLIC should set aside about $8 billion to handle thrifts that are expected to fail soon. When that amount is taken into account, Mr. Wolf testified, the FSLIC ended 1986 with a deficit of more than $3 billion.    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees the FSLIC, has said the fund had reserves of $1.9 billion on Dec. 31.    Meanwhile, the Bank Board is looking into how to borrow money from the U.S. Treasury for the first time in its history, according to administration and congressional sources.    With a dispute over whether any money is available to insure the more than $900 billion in deposits that the FSLIC backs in the nation's 3,200 federally insured thrifts, the borrowed funds could be used to maintain the public's confidence in thrift deposits, the sources said.    Bank Board officials said they had no comment on this matter.    Both of these developments underscore the dire condition of the federal thrift regulators and the need to raise money for the FSLIC. Legislation to add as much as $25 billion over five years for the fund is currently under consideration in the House.    Since it was established in 1943, the FSLIC has supported itself with premiums from institutions it insures and with income from investments. The FSLIC is authorized to borrow as much as $750 million in additional funds for insurance purposes from the Treasury, but has never used that option.    Use of this line of credit would increase the federal budget deficit, but the Bank Board could issue public debt securities to repay the Treasury.    On Monday, Bank Board Chairman Edwin Gray asked the Justice Department for a legal opinion on whether congressional action is necessary before the FSLIC may draw those funds, according to the sources. A Justice Department official declined to comment yesterday, citing department policy not to discuss requests for opinions.    According to a separate GAO report on the FSLIC presented to Congress yesterday, congressional action isn't necessary for the FSLIC to borrow the money.    Testifying on the GAO's audit of the FSLIC's books, Mr. Wolf told the lawmakers, &quot;Clearly, such a fund balance cannot handle the real liability FSLIC now faces.&quot; Ailing thrifts kept open by the Bank Board lose $6 million a day, according to the Bank Board.    A Bank Board spokesman said the agency hadn't any comment on the GAO's findings. Last week, Mr. Gray said the fund's current reserves totaled $1.4 billion.    Also yesterday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) made final changes to a comprehensive banking bill the panel is to consider tomorrow. Mr. Proxmire made the revisions, which weaken two major provisions, after consulting with Democrats on the committee.    The bill would place a ban on the establishment of new limited-service banks beginning tomorrow until one year after the measure becomes law. Limited-service banks already operating wouldn't be allowed to expand either their services or the number of their offices during that time. The bill would limit the annual growth of those institutions' assets to 3%.    Mr. Proxmire had sought to abolish all limited-service banks established after July 1, 1983. Limited-service banks, also called non-bank banks, either accept deposits or make commercial loans, but not both, and aren't subject to the restrictions put on full-service banks.    In addition, the Federal Reserve Board would be barred from granting additional securities or insurance underwriting powers to bank holding companies for the same period of time. Mr. Proxmire had sought congressional approval for bank holding companies to underwrite commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, municipal revenue bonds and mutual funds.    The Fed has said it would make decisions by April on applications -- made through a gap in current law -- from Bankers Trust New York Corp., Citicorp and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. for most of the same underwriting authority proposed in the original Proxmire bill.    No other changes were made in the rest of the bill, which includes provisions raising $7.5 billion for the FSLIC, giving federal regulators broader powers to deal with troubled financial institutions and limiting the amount of time an institution may hold customers' deposited checks before making the funds available for withdrawal.    The American Bankers Association, which had endorsed the original Proxmire bill, withdrew its support for the legislation. The trade group said the revised bill isn't strong enough on limited-service banks and takes a &quot;dramatic step backwards&quot; on additional powers for banks. </TEXT></DOC>
