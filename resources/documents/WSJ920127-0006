The new spreadsheet from Daniel Bricklin and RobertFrankston, the creators of VisiCalc, is a second attempt tostrike it rich in the spreadsheet business where their firstproduct was surpassed by Lotus Development Corp.'s 1-2-3.</LP><TEXT>   The two men have developed a $295 spreadsheet called AtHand for Slate Corp., a closely held Scottsdale, Ariz., firmthat is producing software for the nascent pen market. Infact, the pen market is so new that At Hand won't go on saleuntil after GO Corp., Foster City, Calif., completes work onan operating system for pen computers early this spring.Users control pen computers by writing on their screens witha pen-like wand.   Pen computers &quot;open up spreadsheets to people who aren'tcomfortable with keyboards,&quot; says Mr. Bricklin, who is vicepresident of Slate's Boston area development center.Demonstrating At Hand, he prints three numbers in a column;the computer recognizes them and turns them into neat type.He taps twice at the top of the column and makes a plus signat the bottom; the computer totals the figures. &quot;You can doback-of-the-envelope calculations in a boardroom or on akitchen table,&quot; he says.   The pen computer can also hold huge spreadsheets developedusing Lotus's 1-2-3 or Microsoft Corp.'s Excel, so users cancarry the information around or see the effect of changingjust one or two numbers by hand.   Mr. Bricklin was 28 and studying at Harvard BusinessSchool when he designed VisiCalc in 1979. Mr. Frankston, whohe had known as an undergraduate at Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, did most of the programming. VisiCalc, whichran on an Apple computer &quot;really created the personalcomputer market,&quot; says Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0,an industry newsletter.   VisiCalc was snapped up by Wall Street analysts, corporatestrategic planners and recently minted MBAs. &quot;It was thefirst product useful to large numbers of people thatcorporations would spend money on,&quot; says Ms. Dyson.   The two men started a programming company called SoftwareArts Inc. and planned to build a giant. But they becameembroiled in litigation, and they misread the market's moveto the International Business Machines Corp.'s personalcomputer. Lotus's 1-2-3 quickly took over the spreadsheetmarket. In 1985, debt-ridden and discouraged, they soldVisiCalc to Lotus where Mr. Frankston went to work.   Mr. Bricklin, who says resignedly, &quot;I didn't even become amillionaire off of VisiCalc,&quot; started programming in hishouse. &quot;Dan Bricklin's Demo Program&quot; became popular amonghard-core programmers, and a program for laser printers metmoderate success.   Messrs. Bricklin and Frankston came together again atSlate when they became intrigued by the potential of pencomputers. Mr. Bricklin says he designed the prototype of theproduct and Mr. Frankston wrote a &quot;scripting language&quot; thatlets users program the pen computers; other programmers didmost of the programming.   The market potential for At Hand is unclear. Will Fastie,a software analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons in Baltimore, sayshe thinks most pen computers will be used by corporate salesand service organizations where people will fill outelectronic forms on the screens. &quot;I personally am a littleskeptical of the appeal of horizontal applications,&quot; such asspreadsheets, he says. Ms. Dyson adds, &quot;they've done a nicespreadsheet, but it won't play the same role in pens that itdid for the PC.&quot;   Mr. Bricklin, who still wears the long black beard andplaid work shirts he sported in his college days, figures AtHand wins either way. &quot;For people who have never bought acomputer, this could be a reason to buy it. Other people willbuy the pen computers for custom applications and thenthey'll add this.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
