A comparison between powder characteristics, sintering behavior,and mechanical properties of sintered virgin and reclaimed cemented carbideswas made. The most important and promising result was found from thereal rock-drilling tests. In spite of the differences in powder characteristicsand behavior during sintering, the reclaimed cemented carbide insertshad similar performance in drilling operation to virgin hard-metal inserts.Nor were there significant differences between different reclaimed/virginblends. It was possible to drill about 130 meters with all inserts, whichis a good result for the type of drill used. The authors used a hand-helddrill in their tests, but the results might be different if a biggertype of drill were used.</TEXT></DOC>
