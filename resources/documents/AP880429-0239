LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Soviet official on Friday criticized NATO'sdecision to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the issue wouldbe discussed at the superpower summit in Moscow next month.   Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin told a news conferencethe action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization diminished thesignificance of last year's U.S.-Soviet pact to eliminateintermediate-range nuclear missiles.   NATO defense ministers agreed at their Nuclear Planning Groupmeeting in Brussels Thursday to develop a replacement for theshort-range Lance missile and a new air-launched missile forbombers.   Adamishin called the NATO decision serious and said, ``We areagainst modernization. We want to reduce the level of nuclear andother armaments and not to raise it.''   He was asked if the issue was serious enough to be discussed atthe May 29-June 3 meeting of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev andPresident Reagan and replied:   ``They have to discuss this problem. It's one of the keyproblems of the situation.   ``As soon as we have some result in reducing arms, immediatelythere is a tendency _ and it's a negative tendency _ to try tocompensate, to try not to give the full development to thisdisarmament tendency.''   Adamishin said it was a ``rather interesting coincidence'' thatin Brussels America asserted the Soviet Union was conducting teststo shorten the range of some intercontinental ballistic missiles(ICBMs), so they could be targeted towards Europe, and then NATOagreed to develop new missiles.   He said: ``Let's consider for a moment that the Americans areright and we are making ICBMs to hit targets in Europe, althoughexperts would say this is absolute nonsense, ... why not appeal tothe Soviet Union to demand clarification, to discuss this situation?   ``No, at the moment the news breaks out, the decision has beenadopted (by NATO).''   Adamishin said he still hoped U.S. and Soviet negotiators wouldreach agreement on cutting long-range nuclear missiles by 50percent before the summit.   ``If we fail in climbing this mountain, then the task would beto go as high as possible on the way toward the top and to create asituation which would make it impossible to go back,'' he said.   ``We are working in this direction.... There are very seriousand large efforts on our side to make this agreement a reality.''   He added the United States should be ``a little bit morepersistent'' in trying to resolve outstanding issues, and listed asexamples a ceiling on sea-launched missiles and a verificationsystem.   Both sides have agreed to those points, he said, but Washingtonhas not specified a ceiling or responded to Soviet proposals onverification.   In the case of ICBMs and submarine-launched missiles, Adamishinsaid ``there is more or less a clear picture emerging as to how theagreement would work.''   But with sea-launched cruise missiles and some other weaponswhere the United States has ``a considerable superiority over us''there is no agreement, he said. He did not specify what otherweapons he was referring to.</TEXT></DOC>
