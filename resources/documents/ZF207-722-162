(includes related article on laser power)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Forst, Gary T.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Sharpness and brightness are the two key advantages of lasers.andO;Sharpness refers to a laser beam's focusing ability on a spotlimited in size only by the wavelength of the light, whilebrightness refers to the amount of light delivered to a targetarea.andP;  These two properties determine the speed and density of agiven application and generally involve trade-offs.andP;  Today's laserdiodes, which can be as small as a grain of sand, solve thecooling problems associated with gas lasers.andP;  All lasers requireoptical coatings with unique reflective properties for basicoperation.andP;  Computers are used to control laser systems bymanipulating the direction the laser points in.andP;  Lasers are alsoused to fabricate chips with increased yields, improvingworkstation performance.andP;  High-resolution I/O devices and opticaldata storage are other applications of laser technology.andP;  Colorlaser printers are being developed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     LasersOptoelectronic devicesComputer DesignOptical ComputersTechnology.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotographchart.andO;Caption:   Semiconductor laser.
