KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate supporters of a bill imposing harsh newsanctions against white-dominated South Africa acknowlegedWednesday they do not have the votes to override a certain veto byPresident Reagan.   But they said that in order to highlight opposition to SouthAfrica's racial policies, they would battle for Senate passage ofthe bill, which requires an end to most trade with South Africa aswell as the withdrawal of all U.S. corporate investment.   Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, DeputySecretary of State John C. Whitehead strongly opposed the harshsanctions measure as counterproductive.   And Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the leading opponent of usingsanctions to increase pressures on South Africa to adopt majorityrule reforms, said he will introduce legislation repealing the lesssevere sanctions bill passed over President Reagan's veto two yearsago.   Whitehead said that while the Reagan administration believesapartheid is repugnant, ``sanctions are the wrong tool becauseSouth Africa has the resources to resist an economic siege and hasbeen preparing for such a contingency for many years.''   He said it has become clear over the past two years that theindustrial allies of the United States will resist the U.S. leadand will not impose sanctions of their own.   He said South Africa could at will cut off exports of strategicminerals vital to U.S. industrial efforts.   Americans must accept the fact that U.S. leverage in SouthAfrica is limited, Whitehead said.   ``Resorting to drastic remedies, such as the misuse of Americanpower to destabilize the South African economy, only increases thechances of a catastrophic outcome for all South Africans,''Whitehead said.   Instead, he said, `'our mission should beone of using allavailable means to maximize our influence and leverage.'   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a strong sanctions supporter, saidthe administration's attitude demonstrates that the ``thoroughlydiscredited'' administration policy of ``constructive engagement''to nudge South Africa toward reform still survives.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said the 1986 sanctions bill has notproduced results because ``the administration has been dragging itsfeet, creating loopholes, doing nothing to urge our allies to joinin the sanctions.''   But he and other senators said the drive to impose virtuallytotal economic sanctions likely will fall short, at least for now.   ``Candidly, right now I don't think we have the votes tooverride a veto,'' Simon said.   But he said the effort should proceed to demonstrate the breadthof the U.S. opposition to apartheid and to support internalpressures for change in South Africa.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., another sanctions supporter,told the committee: ``There are those who say that waging economicwar against South Africa will only hurt the people we want to help,the black workers. But those people are already being hurt moreprofoundly by apartheid than any trade sanction we could possiblydevise or impose.''   The sanctions measure calls for the total removal of all U.S.corporations and businesses from South Africa and for the end oftwo-way trade except for U.S. imports of certain strategic SouthAfrican minerals.   A similar sanctions bill apparently has gathered strongermomentum in the House.   So far it has been consdidered favorably by the House ForeignAffairs, Intelligence, Armed Services and Banking committees and ispending before the Ways and Means Committee.   It is likely to be considered on the House floor at a relativelyearly date. Passage is expected by a large majority, probablygreater than the two-thirds needed to override a veto.</TEXT></DOC>
