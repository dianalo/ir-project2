HAMM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge on Monday blocked the Districtof Columbia's curfew law from taking effect for at least 10 daysbecause of questions about its constitutionality.   The curfew, passed by the city council April 4 in an attempt tokeep youths from becoming involved in drugs and crime, had been setto start at 11 p.m. EDT Monday and continue for 90 days.   ``There are serious First, Fourth and Fifth Amendment concernsraised in this issue,'' U.S. District Judge Charles H. Richey saidbefore issuing a temporary restraining order, which he said hewould extend for another 10 days if necessary.   ``I'm happy today. My clients are happy today,'' said Arthur B.Spitzer, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union,representing 15 young people who contended the curfew threatenstheir constitutional rights.   ``This law will do essentially nothing to solve the problem ofdrugs in the district, while having harmful effects on the rightsof our youth,'' he said. ``There is no reason to put juvenilesunder house arrest every night,'' he added.   The judge said he would hold a hearing in the near future toreach a final decision on the curfew law.   Richey struck down the city's original curfew law on March 20.   The latest version, while still requiring those under age 18 tobe off the city's streets, sidewalks and other public areas by 11p.m. Sunday through Thursday and midnight Friday and Saturday,contains several exceptions.   Exempt from the curfew would be minors accompanied by a parent;those returning home from an activity sponsored by a church, schoolor non-profit organization; those traveling in a motor vehicle; andthose employed during curfew hours or on an emergency errand.   Police would take violators to the nearest police station andcall their parents. There would be no fine for a first violation.Parents would be fined $100 for the second violation and $300 forall subsequent ones.   If the parent didn't come for the violator, the youth would bein the custody of the Human Services Department's child protectiveservices office until 6 a.m., then sent home.   Spitzer said the curfew law discriminates against poorerjuveniles because many come from broken homes or have parentsworking odd shifts and unable to accompany them.   He said youths living in public housing could not step out thedoor during the curfew while youngsters in more affluentneighborhoods have private property surrounding their homes.   Assistant city lawyer Victor Long said that the council hadadopted the ``least restrictive measure'' it could to deal withjuvenile crime. The law did not infringe on constitutional rightsbut sought to place ``reasonable restraints'' for ``a validreason,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
