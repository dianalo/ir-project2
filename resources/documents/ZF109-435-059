 Isthere a parking utility that comes with the drive that I should be using?andO;Also, is it true that the company has gone bust?andP;  My dealer's beingfantastically unhelpful.andP;  Jean Middleton, London SW14.andM;A Not so much gone bust, as been snapped up by another company.andM;This summer, Miniscribe disappeared into Maxtor Europe ((0483) 729814) andone of the reasons you've probably had trouble tracking them down is thatthere aren't actually many staff in the UK at the moment, which means thetelephone has a tendency to ring for a long time.andP;  Persevere and you'll getan answer.andP;  As for the dealer, if Maxtor is keen -- as indeed it should be --to pick up Miniscribe's old customers, then it'll take a big stick to him.andM;Q We've been using Windows 3.0 almost since it came out and we think it looksgreat.andP;  The only thing we don't like is when, during an entirely routine savein Word for Windows 1.0, we get an error message -- 'System error cannot readfrom drive C: Cancel Retry'.andP;  After that, the best we can do is to hit thebig switch, recover our most recently saved file and start again from there.andO;It's got so bad that we've given up and gone back to text-based wordprocessing.andP;  There we shall shall stay until we get an answer.andP;  The Surgeons,Surgery Central, PC User, London.andP;  (Doctor, heal thyself -- ed.)andM;A A long one.andP;  First, you confirm that the problem only happens in 386Enhanced mode and doesn't seem to be associated with any non-Windows programsor TSRs like SideKick.andP;  Checking through the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYSfiles, everything appears to be in order, the version number of DOS is OK andall's well with the rest of the world.andP;  Except that it isn't, because there'sa problem with the way your hard disk has been set up.andP;  Windows 3.0 includesa cacheing utility called SMARTDRV.SYS which is there to enhance performance.andM;According to Microsoft, SMARTDrive improves speed on all systems, is idealfor users who work with several applications and files at once, is installedautomatically by Setup and is farly easy to adjust.andP;  The disadvantages arethat it requires either extended or expanded memory and can't be used inconjunction with other disk cacheing programs.andM;There is, however, a much bigger disadvantage.andM;The trouble is that SMARTDRV.SYS doesn't go through the operating system likea good program should.andP;  Instead, it writes directly to the hardware.andP;  Thatmeans when it pages to disk, it expects the swap file to be in a certainplace and the hard disk to have been set up in a certain way -- using theFdisk utility which formats to 512 bytes per sector and comes with DOS.andP;  Ifyour hard disk has been set up using someone else's program, you may be introuble.andP;  Here's how to solve it.andM;The instant way to fixe the problem is to remove the line DEVICE =C:\WINDWOS\SMARTDRV.SYS from your CONFIG.SYS file.andP;  This will eradicate anydifficulties you have in reading or writing to the C: drive.andP;  It will alsodeprive you of the use of the cacheing software.andP;  Not great.andM;The other way is far worse.andP;  If you find that performance stutters withoutSMARTDRV.SYS and you just can't do without it, you'll have to reformat thehard disk and partition it using the 'approved' Fdisk.andM;Officially, Microsoft explains the problem thus: &quot;The Microsoft Windowsdevelopment team has identified two rare scenarios that might result in lossor corruption of data.andP;  The scenarios involve using third-partydisk-partitioning software with Microsoft's SMARTDrive disk cacheing utility.andO;We've shipped several hundred thousand copies of Windows 3.0 and have only 12customers with verified problems.&quot;andP;  (The surgeons request that the number berevised to 13.)andM;&quot;Microsoft Windows 3.0 works fine on these systems.andP;  The conflict arisesbetween the disk cacheing utility included with Windows called SMARTDrive and(certain) third-party disk partitioning software.andP;  Windows 3.0 is fullyfunctional without the optional disk cacheing utility.&quot;andM;According to Microsoft, there are two basic systems which are potentially atrisk.andM;* A PC with third-party disk partitioning software such as Disk Manager fromOntrack Systems, SpeedStor from Storage Dimensions, Innerspace from Priam orVfeatures Deluxe from Golden Bow Systems, with a hard disk with more than1024 cylinders and SMARTDrive active.andM;* A PC with third-party disk partitioning software, a hard disk whose type isnot directly supported by the system's ROM BIOS, which is using SMARTDrive,and DOS 3.30 or higher.andP;  The risk is greater if your PC has been customisedwith off-the-shelf parts.andP;  Name brand computers ship with ROM BIOS versionsthat support the hard disks installed by the manufacturer.andM;The official solution is actually no better than the one suggested by thesurgeons.andP;  In Microsoft's own words: &quot;If you've identified that your systemis at risk, you can either remove SMARTDrive or repartition your hard diskusing the DOS Fdisk utility instead of third-party partitioning software.&quot;andM;Microsoft says it's working to make SMARTDrive compatible with third-partypartitioning programs and will proviee a free update to affected users in thenear future.andP;  What's not clear from the official statement is that, as thingsstand, this will simply allow SMARTDrive to switch itself off when itdiscovers a hard disk with a third-party partition.andP;  The surgeons suggestthat this is a shabby way to treat your users.andP;  More news as we get it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
