(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Where most people list their jobexperiences, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry's resume brags,``Arrested 26 times in seven cities.''   Terry complains it's out-of-date.   ``It might be closer to 30 right now,'' the 29-year-old activistsaid during an interview at the unmarked storefront office inupstate New York where the latest protests against abortion arebeing planned.   Since its national debut at the Democratic National Convention inAtlanta last summer, Operation Rescue has made abortion ahigh-profile issue again.   Terry and his followers have blocked women from entering abortionclinics throughout the country, lying in front of doors until policecarry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras.   Terry says he is trying to produce the ``social tension''necessary to change abortion laws by using the non-violent 1960scivil rights protest as a model.   ``He's the Martin Luther King of a movement,'' said DominickBrignola, an Albany lawyer and footsoldier in the anti-abortiondrive.   Terry's critics claim Operation Rescue, so named becausefollowers try to ``rescue'' the unborn, is an assault on women'srights.   ``The civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people.They're trying to take away the rights of living, breathing humanbeings,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National Organizationfor Women.   More than 450 anti-abortion demonstrators clogged Atlanta jailsduring the five-day Democratic convention. Since then,demonstrations have spread to New York City, Indianapolis,Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia and Boston and still more cities.   The activists want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade,its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions. An estimated1.6 million women have abortions each year in the United States.   Standing at the forefront of Operation Rescue is a used carsalesman who once wanted to be a rock star.   Terry and his wife, Cindy, began their crusade in 1984 bystanding in front of abortion clinics, trying to talk women out ofentering. Friends soon joined them, and the couple opened an officethat offered women free pregnancy tests and hand-me-down babyclothes.   ``God clicked a light on in my head and said it wasn't enough tojust be against child-killing, that I had to do something aboutit,'' said Terry, who's selling his auto dealership because he istoo busy with Operation Rescue.   Critics concede Terry has a mesmerizing personality. He eventries to convert relatives at family reunions, said Dawn Marvin ofRochester, his aunt.   Terry was reared in a low-key Protestant environment but quithigh school at 17, dreaming of a career in music, said Marvin, whois communications director for the Rochester chapter of PlannedParenthood, a medical service that anti-abortion pickets frequentlytarget. She stressed that she does not speak for the organizationabout her nephew.   ``He went away and he flipped out,'' she said about Terry'stransformation into a born-again Christian. ``He came back a totallychanged personality. It was more like a cult reaction than aspiritual quest.''   Marriage and his highly public role as Operation Rescue spokesmanhave calmed him somewhat, she said. The Terrys have one child andthree foster children.   Terry dismisses his aunt's comments _ including her assessmentthat ``he's an egomaniac,'' lapping up news media attention.   To Margaret Johnston, administrator at Southern Tier Women'sServices in Binghamton, Operation Rescue is nothing new. She saidanti-abortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot andglued the clinic's door shut four or five times.   Terry's first arrest came in January 1986 when he chained himselfto a sink at the clinic, which performs abortions. He was jailed for22 days for refusing to pay a $60 fine.   ``It doesn't matter what you say to him. There is no reasoninvolved,'' Johnston said. ``He doesn't care about women. I think hereally hates women.''   Iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to theBinghamton clinic. A court order keeps the nearly ever-presentdemonstrators at shouting distance.   ``They really want to make it personal,'' Johnston said.   Even when she has run into him on a Saturday in the post office,Johnston said Terry has shouted at her, ``How many babies did youmurder today?''   Terry criticizes the anti-abortion movement as being ``too nice''during the 1980s, pacified by the presence of an ideological friendlike President Reagan into not working hard for its goal.   ``We cry that abortion is murder, it's child-killing, and yet wecarry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters,'' hesaid. ``That's not an adequate response to murder. A logicalresponse to murder is physical intervention on behalf of thevictim.''   The lean, bushy-haired Terry expects and even hopes hisdemonstrators will be arrested. He claims Operation Rescue isresponsible for 11,000 arrests this year and predicts 500,000 willbe arrested in the next year.   There are no situations, he said, when abortions are justified.   ``In most areas of life it's OK for people to follow their ownbeliefs, but not when it comes to having innocent childrenmurdered,'' he said.   ``That's like saying, `Why can't a white man follow his ownconscience concerning owning a black slave? Why can't a Germanfollow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot Jews?'''   Terry has attracted some prominent supporters, including formerpresidential candidate Pat Robertson, who said he backs ``any meansshort of violence'' to stop abortion.   If anti-abortion demonstrators set their minds to it, Terry said,they could change abortion laws in six months because the politicalsystem is not built to deal with mass protests.   Yard dismisses Terry as a ``puppet'' groomed for the role ofpoint man in the latest anti-abortion offensive.   ``Women are really outraged by the whole thing,'' she said. ``Thereason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings (ofabortion clinics) and Operation Rescue is that people don't believeRoe vs. Wade can be overturned. ... I'm not so sanguine. All I knowis we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can.''   At Operation Rescue's office, a competing outcry is being plotted.   Pinned to the wall is a large map of the United States, with``abortion mills'' dotted in red. Terry distractedly complains to astaff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that willtake him to a television appearance.   As a photographer snaps pictures, he removes his foot from hisdesk, saying ``that's too casual for someone trying to change worldhistory.''   He adds, chuckling: ``It's comical, really. I think God has asense of humor. Don't you think it's rather funny that a former usedcar salesman is heading such a movement?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues AMs Jan. 3</NOTE></DOC>
