The pristine lake offers five-star fly-rodding for big, bulldogging bluegill and acrobatic large-mouth bass; the challenging sporting-clays course is an excellent place to try a custom shotgun.    Yet the real thrills lie within the native stone walls of the gun shop. Safes filled with fine shotguns hold as much excitement and promise for a firearms connoisseur as does a box of shiny new crayons for a child.    While browsing through the Berettas, Ferlibs, Weatherbys, Arrietas and the like you will come across something that most would think out of place in a premier gun shop. Along with the finest sporting arms in the world, Mr. Murphy sells air rifles, guns that use compressed air rather than burned powder to propel a projectile.    The thought of such guns often brings flashbacks of adolescence and plinking tin cans with inexpensive and often inaccurate weapons. Yet air guns have been around for centuries, and were developed to be anything but toys.    &quot;We know there have been air guns in existence for 400 years,&quot; said Robert Beeman, president of Beeman Precision Arms Inc. of Santa Rosa, Calif., and a noted airgun expert. &quot;By the late 1700s there were some very sophisticated military air guns. For instance, there was a .51-caliber air gun that could fire 10 shots in as many seconds and be lethal to 200 yards. Remember, this was a time when powder guns were still loaded down the barrel {which took up to a minute per shot}.&quot;    But air rifles designed for adults all but faded from the American shooting scene with the advent of cheaper and more reliable cartridge-loading guns.    The past decade, however, has seen the cycle start to reverse. Ironically the current limitations on cartridge-firing firearms are partially responsible for the skyrocketing popularity of adult air guns.    The combination of tighter gun laws and an increasingly urban society is making it more and more difficult for many Americans to find a place to shoot firearms. Busy schedules also are limiting how much time shooters can spend traveling to and from gun ranges.    According to Mr. Murphy, many have simply opted for a hassle-free alternative to their beloved sport. &quot;Even in an area with the strictest of gun laws it's easy for someone to use an air gun,&quot; said Mr. Murphy, whose shop sits a few miles north of this Wichita suburb. &quot;One of their real beauties is that you can shoot them in your backyard, home or office.&quot;    Using specially made but inexpensive metal traps, air-gun shooters can have target practice inside with minimal danger. The guns' near-silence also will not offend shooters -- or their neighbors.    Another big attraction has been the continuing development of adult air rifles by such companies as Mr. Beeman's, RWS of Germany and others. Comparing the Beemans in Mr. Murphy's shop to the tiny and cheaply made Red Ryders of our youth is, as one observer said, &quot;like comparing a Mercedes to a moped.&quot;    Quality adult air rifles rival their large, cartridge-firing counterparts in size, feel, options -- and accuracy. The trio of fine air rifles that Mr. Murphy laid upon a table were all crafted of thick, beautifully finished hardwood and quality steel. They pointed and balanced as well as most hunting rifles, and each was topped with a specially designed telescopic sight. Adult air guns also come in a variety of sizes and calibers, some of which can shoot a pellet at a velocity of more than 1,000 feet per second.    Though the lead pellets fired by an air rifle can cost as little as a penny a shot, the purchase prices of adult air rifles and conventional rifles are comparable. Good air rifles can cost from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on components and specialized accessories.    Messrs. Beeman and Murphy said adult air guns are becoming increasingly attractive to varied segments of society. &quot;Many avid big game hunters have one in their office and home so they can practice shooting whenever they have a few free minutes,&quot; said Mr. Murphy. &quot;You also can use specially designed pellets for hunting small game or as a selective, clean and humane way {in comparison to poison} to control vermin like feral pigeons or rats.    &quot;But the biggest potential might be for people who don't hunt very much or maybe not at all,&quot; Mr. Murphy added. &quot;They're simply a lot of fun to shoot.&quot;    After his shop closed for the day, Mr. Murphy took the three air rifles, a pellet trap, and an assortment of ammo and targets to his guest quarters. The trap was placed at the end of a hall and a table topped with couch cushions for a gun rest was pulled up 30 feet away.    Mr. Murphy spent a few seconds demonstrating how to cock and load the rifles and then turned them over to a pair of neophytes. Four consecutive shots fired by one of his guests opened a pea-sized hole where the speck of a bullseye used to be. Another target was hung, followed by another, and another, and . . .    &quot;It's kind of like eating peanuts, isn't it?&quot; said Mr. Murphy. &quot;Once you start it's tough to stop.&quot; The umpteenth sounds of lead smacking metal and a rifle being cocked served as a quick answer to his question.    ---   Mr. Pearce is a free-lance writer in Manhattan, Kan. </TEXT></DOC>
