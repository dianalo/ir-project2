France has promised to give Brazil the technology of a liquidfuel motor called Viking, which powers the Ariane space launchvehicle, the officials said. In return, the French companyArianespace would be awarded a $60 million contract for the launchof two Brazilian communications satellites, they added.   The U.S. officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,said French President Francois Mitterrand personally made thedecision to give the technology to Brazil, promising thatsafeguards would be placed to prevent use of the motor for lethalpurposes.   But a statement issued by the government in Paris denied a finaldecision had been made. ``The definitive contract will be submittedto the government for approval and this contract has not yet beengiven'' to the government, the statement said.   ``This contract will have to follow certain purposes andrestrictions regarding technology transfers,'' it said.   The United States, however, is doubtful such safeguards can beimplemented effectively.   ``If someone like Libya wants to use this motor to harmfulpurposes, who will stop them?'' asked one official.   Libya has been seeking to buy from Brazil equipment and know-howin an effort to develop a ballistic missile arsenal capable ofdelivering chemical weapon warheads, according to U.S. experts.   Brazil, one of an estimated 20 Third World countries which havesome form of ballistic missile capability, has been exporting somemissile technology while and attempting to develop a more accurateand sophisticated arsenal of its own.   Word of the planned French sale was first reported by Signalmagazine, published by the Armed Forces Communications andElectronic Association.   Representatives of McDonnell Douglas Corp., the St. Louis-basedfirm competing for the Brazilian launch contract againstArianespace, were informed of the French proosal by Brazilianofficials and conveyed the information to the Defense Department,officials said.   A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, Bob O'Brien, said that if theFrench ``transfer is made, obviously it wouldn't enhance ourchances'' to win the contract. He said Brazil had been expected toannounce its decision already but has not done so yet.   The United States first protested the planned French sale lastJuly during the seven-nation economic summit in Paris, one officialsaid.   For while it appeared the protest had stopped the French plan,the official said. But the French government reconsidered when itappeared France stood to lose the lucrative satellite launchcontract, he said.   The United States has warned France the technology transferwould violate the Missile Technology Control Regime, a 1987agreement to stem the proliferation of such weapons, of whichFrance is a signatory, the official said.   But France contends the Viking motor will be used for peacefullpurposes and would not violate the agreement.   The United States is still reviewing whether it can stop thedeal, the official said.</TEXT></DOC>
