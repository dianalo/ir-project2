The sanctions are the most sweeping measures given to aJapanese brokerage house and are the latest imposed onNomura, the world's largest brokerage firm, in the unfoldingJapanese securities scandal. Analysts agreed that thegovernment's actions will hurt Nomura, but they differed inpredicting how bad the damage will be.</LP><TEXT>   Ministry officials said the latest sanctions -- underwhich operations will be halted for between four and sixweeks at 87 of Nomura's 153 domestic branches -- will punishthe firm for violating a provision in Japan's securities andexchange law that prohibits &quot;excessive promotion&quot; of theshares of a single company, as well as ministry guidelinesagainst compensating favored clients for investment losses.   The compensation of favored clients is at the heart of thesecurities scandal, which has touched Nomura, the other threeof Japan's Big Four securities houses and second-tierbrokerage firms.   In additional sanctions against Nomura yesterday, theministry also ordered the temporary suspension of operationsat the corporate-sales divisions of Japan's three other majorsecurities companies: Daiwa Securities Co., YamaichiSecurities Co. and Nikko Securities Co.   The initial penalties against Nomura, levied in July,included a week-long suspension of corporate sales andspawned pay cuts for senior executives. Some analysts saidthe actions hurt the firm's image more than its pocketbook,but the cumulative impact of the sanctions is beginning totake a heavy toll on Nomura's finances.   Stuart Matthews, a financial analyst at Barclays de ZoeteWedd Securities Ltd., estimated that the temporarysuspensions of Nomura's retail operations could cut earningsby about 10% in the year ending March 31.   Nomura's fiscal pretax profit fell about 50%, to 234billion yen ($1.8 billion), in the year ended March 31, 1991.Mr. Matthews said Nomura, which only a few years ago wasJapan's most profitable company, will struggle to record aprofit in the current fiscal year. &quot;We could see Nomurahitting toward the red,&quot; he said.   Nomura's shares fell 50 yen, or 2.8%, to 1,730 yen($13.40) yesterday.   However, the impact of the ministry's disciplinarymeasures may be limited by an important loophole. Theministry won't prevent Nomura's clients from transferringstocks normally traded through the 87 suspended branchoffices to other Nomura branches, Nomura officials said.Investors also will be able to shift their accounts to one ofNomura's affiliates.   The ministry's penalties &quot;look severe but aren't thatbad,&quot; said Robert Zielinski, an analyst at Jardine FlemingSecurities Ltd. He calculated that the retail-salessuspension will reduce earnings for the current fiscal yearby less than 2%.   In announcing the sanctions, Nobuhiko Matsuno,director-general of the ministry's securities bureau, saidthe sanctions are intended to punish Nomura for usinghigh-pressure tactics in 1989 to sell shares of Tokyu Corp.,a leading railway concern. The 87 branch offices targeted bythe ban were all involved in the Tokyu sales campaign.   Under the sanctions, the ministry extended through the endof November an existing ban on Nomura's participation ingovernment bond auctions that was imposed in September. Italso forbade Japan's investment trusts to deal with any ofthe branches involved in the Tokyo sales campaign for threemonths.   Ministry officials requested the one-week closure ofNomura's corporate-sales operation in response to aninspectors' discovery last month that Nomura and otherJapanese securities firms compensated favored clients forinvestment losses in the year ended March 31, 1991. Anon-binding ministry directive condemns such practice. Allfour brokerage firms had admitted making payments beforeApril 1990 but had insisted they didn't reimburse clients forlosses after that.   Mr. Matsuno stressed that the primary purpose of Nomura'sretail sales suspension, which takes effect Oct. 15, isn't toinflict financial pain but to give the firm's employees &quot;thetime they'll need to implement fundamental reform&quot; of theirmanagement style.   Mr. Matsuno noted that ministry officials are displeasedwith the way Nomura presents the findings of its researchdepartment to its various investors. The publications Nomurahas sent to clients offering advice about stock purchases&quot;contained much information that was extremely subjective,&quot;he said. He also faulted Nomura for putting heavy emphasis onsales quotas in evaluating its sales personnel's performance.   Mr. Matsuno said the ministry warned that officials planto evaluate the thoroughness of the firm's housecleaningefforts at the end of November.   At a news conference, Nomura President Hideo Sakamaki saidhe is less concerned about damage to the company's bottomline than about &quot;restoring investor trust.&quot;   As a measure of Nomura's seriousness, Mr. Sakamakiannounced the resignations of Yoshida Kitsuda, executive vicepresident for domestic sales, and Junichi Nakano, executivemanaging director for equity. Before the scandals sweptNomura, it was widely assumed that either Mr. Kitsuda or Mr.Nakano would eventually assume Nomura's presidency fromYoshihisa Tabuchi. Mr. Tabuchi resigned in June.   Nomura also said that, as punishment for excessivelypromoting Tokyu shares, it will cut its president's pay by20% for a year, its vice president's pay by 20% for ninemonths and lower-ranking senior officials' pay by 20% forbetween two months and six months. For paying compensationafter March 1990, Nomura will cut Mr. Sakamaki's salary anadditional 10% and the pay of directors at the time of thecompensation 10%.   The other big securities firms announced pay cuts as well.Nikko said it will cut the salaries of 14 senior officialsbetween 10% and 30% for six months; Daiwa said it will cutsalaries of five employees, including the president, 10% forsix months; and Yamaichi announced 10% pay cuts for threeofficials and 20% pay cuts for eight other employees for sixmonths.</TEXT></DOC>
