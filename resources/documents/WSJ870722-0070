At one of his last appearances as chairman before Congress, where he was lavishly praised for his inflation-fighting legacy, Mr. Volcker declared: &quot;It's terribly important right at this juncture to be cautious in the conduct of monetary policy.&quot;    Mr. Volcker's statement to a House subcommittee on monetary policy seemed to be a gentle parting admonition that the Fed shouldn't reduce interest rates much -- and may have to raise them -- to guard against price instability. As he delivered his remarks, his designated replacement, Alan Greenspan, was telling a Senate panel that he intends to continue Mr. Volcker's anti-inflation policy.    Mr. Volcker disclosed that the Fed hasn't eased credit conditions in recent weeks. There has been widespread speculation in financial markets that the central bank deliberately had brought interest rates down a bit.    The Fed tightened credit in late April, draining reserves from the banking system and driving interest rates higher, because the dollar was plunging at an alarming rate on foreign exchange markets. But even though the dollar subsequently stabilized, &quot;the approach of the Federal Reserve toward the provision of reserves has not changed since May,&quot; Mr. Volcker told the panel, suggesting that the reason interest rates have receded a little in recent weeks is because of market factors rather than an easier Fed policy.    The Fed chief indicated that the central bank is maintaining its tighter credit grip largely because of concerns about inflation. He observed that inflation &quot;has accelerated appreciably&quot; this year compared with last year, a change that was widely expected because of the rebound in oil prices and the decline of the dollar, which makes imports more expensive.    &quot;We're in a rather critical period right now&quot; in the war against inflation, Mr. Volcker declared. The recent run-up in prices may prove merely temporary, and so far it hasn't been reflected in wage settlements, he said. But if the price surge &quot;gets built into the cost structure, then we have a very serious problem on our hands,&quot; the Fed chief added. It was at that point that he issued his warning about the need for the Fed to be &quot;cautious.&quot;    Members of the House subcommittee lauded Mr. Volcker's eight-year performance at the Fed, during which the central bank pushed interest rates up to record levels to combat double-digit inflation, plunging the nation into a deep recession. But under Mr. Volcker, the Fed's policy subsequently fostered a recovery that has proven surprisingly durable and inflation-free. Panel chairman Stephen Neal (D., N.C.) called the Fed chief &quot;a major hero of our time -- a real hero of our time.&quot;    In his testimony, the first part of the Fed's semiannual report to Congress, Mr. Volcker disclosed that the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, reaffirmed the money-supply targets that it adopted in February for 1987.    But he said the committee agreed that two broad money-supply gauges, M2 and M3, may have to expand &quot;around the lower end&quot; of their growth-target ranges, and possibly even below target. That reinforced indications that the Fed will maintain a moderately restrictive credit stance during the remainder of the year.    On other subjects, Mr. Volcker:    --Issued an unusual criticism of another financial regulatory agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. He said the Bank Board, which regulates the savings and loan industry, &quot;has been insufficiently independent of the industry it regulates.&quot;    --Suggested for the first time that he was somewhat unhappy with the sudden announcement earlier this year by Citicorp and other big banks to set aside billions of dollars in loan-loss reserves for bad loans to developing countries. &quot;One cannot object to conservative accounting,&quot; he said, but added: &quot;One would wish it came about not so dramatically; perhaps it would have been preferable if it had been more gradual.&quot;    --Reiterated his complaints about the size of the federal budget deficit. The deficit targets set by the Gramm-Rudman law, he said, &quot;are threatening to become pie in the sky.&quot;    --Said he hopes an agreement can be concluded by the end of this year with a number of nations to establish uniform rules that would link the amount of capital banks must have to the riskiness of their loan portfolios. A tentative agreement with Britain has already been reached, but Mr. Volcker said it has been put on hold, pending the attainment of a multilateral accord.    In the semiannual monetary-policy report that Mr. Volcker submitted to Congress, the Fed panel said it considers slow growth in M2 and M3 acceptable because of changes in the way those money measures relate to economic growth.    As it did last February, the panel failed to set a target for the narrowest money measure, M1, which consists of cash and checking accounts. The committee has suggested the figure's relationship to underlying economic trends is distorted by interest-rate changes and the introduction of interest-bearing checking accounts. M2 consists of M1 plus savings and money-market accounts; M3 consists of M2 plus large certificates of deposit.    For 1988, the Fed committee set slightly lower M2 and M3 targets than for the current year. This will help assure that the recent bulge in prices doesn't &quot;become a base for a renewed inflationary process,&quot; Mr. Volcker said. The panel set tentative target growth ranges for M2 and M3 of 5% to 8% in 1988, compared with 5.5% to 8.5% for 1987.    According to the Fed report, the panel believes that its monetary growth targets are consistent with inflation-adjusted economic growth of 2.5% to 3% in 1987, and inflation of 3.5% to 4% as measured by the so-called GNP deflator. In February, the panel projected a similar growth rate for 1987, but a slightly lower inflation rate. For 1988, the panel projected inflation-adjusted growth of 2.5% to 3%, and inflation of 3.75% to 4.25%.    ---           The Federal Reserve's Economic Projections                                 Latest        Original  1987  GNP Growth*  (Current dollars)              6.25-7%       5.75-6.5%  GNP Growth*  (Inflation-adjusted)           2.5-3%        2.5-3%  Inflation Rate*  (Measured by the  GNP &quot;Deflator&quot;)                3.5-4%        3-3.5%  Average  Unemployment Rate  (4th quarter 1987)             6.2-6.4%      6.5-6.75%  1988  GNP Growth**  (Current dollars)              5.75-7%        ---  GNP Growth**  (Inflation-adjusted)           2.5-3%         ---  Inflation Rate**  (Measured by the  GNP &quot;Deflator&quot;)                3.75-4.25%     ---  Average  Unemployment Rate  (4th quarter 1988)             6-6.5%         ---  Note: Figures represent the consensus estimate of Fedgovernors and district Reserve Bank presidents  *Measured from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987  **Measured from fourth quarter 1987 to fourth quarter 1988</TEXT></DOC>
