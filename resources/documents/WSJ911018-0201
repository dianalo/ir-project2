A lead ball zings through the dark and smacks the exactcenter of a can of car wax. &quot;Haven't lost me touch,&quot; thepoacher says, lowering his slingshot. &quot;I hope ol' Alan heardthat.&quot;   Alan Count is a gamekeeper who lives just two doors away.He, too, is plotting for the season ahead. &quot;This time ofyear, you don't linger at the pub,&quot; he says, testing ahigh-powered lamp. &quot;You don't want the poacher to know whereyou're lurking about.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In England each autumn, as pheasants grow fat and leavesfall from trees, gamekeepers and poachers begin acenturies-old rite. Prowling through the dark, deployingeverything from horsehair to infrared beams, they duel overgame that is reared for the sport of much richer men. Atstake is their livelihood, and also their pride.   &quot;The poacher knows most of my tricks and I know most ofhis,&quot; says Mr. Count, a keeper for 35 of his 53 years. &quot;We'reheads and tails of the same coin.&quot;   Mr. Count's role isn't the romantic one of the gamekeeperwho beds Lady Chatterley in D.H. Lawrence's novel. He beganhis career trapping rats and selling their tails for aha'penny bounty. Later, he toted bullets and bagged game fora rich huntsman with a waxed mustache and manners to match.&quot;The only thing he ever said to me was `don't drag them haresthrough the mud]'&quot; Mr. Count recalls.   Even so, gamekeeping offered some escape from class-riddenrural life. &quot;The land belonged to rich people, and much of itstill does,&quot; he says. &quot;But if you're a keeper, the land isyour beat. It belongs to you.&quot;   It also is his to defend. For the gamekeeper, poachers arebut one of many pests with which he must wage nonstopguerrilla war. By day he sets traps for stoats and weasels,and uses ferrets to flush out hares. By night, he stalksfoxes, feral cats, badgers and other &quot;vermin&quot; that prey ongame birds, their eggs or their food. His only ally is a hipflask of sloe gin, &quot;the keeper's drink.&quot;   Picking up the potent, garlicky scent of a fox, Mr. Countpans his lamp and spots a pair of flame-red eyes in a beetfield. To lure the fox closer, he makes a squeaky sound withhis mouth and hands, mimicking a wounded rabbit. &quot;I reckonevery predator's entitled to his share,&quot; he says, raising hisgun. &quot;But the fox is a wanton killer. He'll take every birdhe can.&quot;   So too does Mr. Count's neighbor in Nocton, a poacherwhose nom de guerre is Charley Peace, a 19th-century catburglar famed for eluding the law. The modern-day Mr. Peaceonce dreamed of gamekeeping, but when he couldn't find a postturned to poaching instead. He tries, however, to target vastestates.   &quot;I loathe aristocracy,&quot; says the 44-year-old laborer, agrizzled man with graying mutton chops. &quot;Game was put on thisearth for every man. I'm just part of the natural balance.&quot;   The workshop behind his home is decorated with hugeantlers. &quot;Them's from the Earl of Ancaster's estate,&quot; hechuckles. &quot;Took that stag with a wire snare.&quot; His armory alsoincludes a rifle fitted with a homemade silencer, a dragnetfor sweeping up partridges, and raisins threaded withhorsehair, which catch in a pheasant's throat and leave thebird flapping on the ground.   But Mr. Peace's preferred weapon is a simple, hazel-woodslingshot. &quot;Silent, deadly and efficient,&quot; he explains. Onbright nights, he picks out the pheasant's silhouette anddowns the bird with lead musketballs he crafts himself.&quot;Simplicity itself,&quot; he says. &quot;And no need to spit shot outat dinner.&quot;   For cover, he relies on a face mask and foul weather. &quot;Theonly night to go out is when it's fit for neither man norbeast,&quot; he says. In the wet and cold, birds roost low in thetrees, sound doesn't carry, and keepers are less likely toventure out.   Mr. Peace clears about $400 a week in season illicitlyselling poached game on the cheap to willing dealers. And in25 years, he's been caught only once, when a jitteryaccomplice turned him in. Reveling in his roguish success,Mr. Peace wears his poaching camouflage to the pub and oftenleaves a bird or musketball at the scene of the crime, &quot;as mecalling card.&quot;   Even so, stealthy loners like Mr. Peace are a dying breed.To some degree, gamekeepers tolerate local poachers,particularly &quot;one for the pot&quot; men who catch birds for theirown consumption. But city gangs have been moving in, taking1,000 birds a night and disregarding the smalltimer's turf.   To defend against them, some keepers use night-sightbinoculars, infrared beams to locate intruders, and rubberpheasants that set off an alarm when hit. The gangs, many ofthem from depressed mining and mill towns, also have acertain flair. Alan Edwards, a North Yorkshire gamekeeper,has found couples smooching in getaway cars -- as decoys,while their partners poach game with lamps and dogs.   Mr. Edwards spends his Friday nights creeping with the fogacross the desolate grouse moors. A light flashes in thegloom, shuts off, flashes again. Mr. Edwards checks hiswatch. &quot;That'd be right,&quot; he says. &quot;It's pub letting-outtime.&quot;   Back in his jeep, he edges forward without lights. But thepoachers hear him and break for a waiting car. Mr. Edwardshits on a spotlight and gives chase. &quot;Jill, can you read me?&quot;he yells into his radio phone. Jill is his wife, who relaysmessages from the Edwards's cottage to the police. On thisnight, though, she is sound asleep.   Mr. Edwards bluffs instead. &quot;Give it up, lads]&quot; he shouts.&quot;The police are on the way]&quot; The driver, a scowling youngskinhead, waves his fist and shouts a threatening obscenity.Then the two men begin a high-speed chase across a wheatfield, with the poacher trying to bump Mr. Edwards's truck.   &quot;Not worth getting killed for,&quot; Mr. Edwards says, as thecar vanishes in the fog. Though poachers only face a fine ofabout $75, many have criminal records and would rather fightthan face the police. Mr. Edwards once was badly beaten;other keepers have been wounded with crossbows, andoccasionally shot dead.   For gamekeepers, such risks bring modest rewards. Those ontraditional landed estates earn about $300 a week, plus tipsfrom hunters and a range of rather feudal perks: a lonelycottage, coal for the fire, work clothes and a tweed suit towear on shooting days. Mr. Count, the Nocton keeper, prefersto work for &quot;shooting syndicates&quot; that rent or buy land foruse during the hunting season. But to &quot;keep the wolf from thedoor,&quot; he says, he has often had to take second jobs.   This fall, Mr. Count began teaching gamekeeping at theLincolnshire College of Agriculture. While passing on theage-old wiles of his craft, he also teaches his students howto deal with animal-rights activists, who often appear athunts, shouting &quot;Scum] Scum] Kill For Fun]&quot; and tootlinghorns to mislead dogs. If the Labour Party wins next year, itmay well try to ban &quot;blood sports,&quot; especially fox-hunting,which Oscar Wilde termed &quot;the unspeakable in full pursuit ofthe uneatable.&quot;   &quot;To most people now, we're cruel old bastards who murderand persecute every creature in sight,&quot; Mr. Count reflects,dropping a rabbit on the run at 75 yards. &quot;I guess if there'sjustice in this world, I'll collapse out here one day, wherethe vermin can feast on me.&quot;   Gamekeeping also is under siege on other fronts. Manyestates have broken up, thinning keepers' ranks to just2,500, down from 23,000 in 1911. And as village life wanes,there are fewer men with the appetite or know-how for lonelypatrol of woods, moors and fens.   But Mr. Count clings to one consolation: If gamekeepers gothe way of the dodo, so too will his lifelong antagonist,Charley Peace. &quot;He's not a villainous character, really,&quot; Mr.Count says, slipping out of the pub as his counterpartappears. &quot;So in heaven, he'll still be poaching birds, andI'll still be there chasing after him.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
