Among recent anti-testing court actions, a San Francisco jury awarded $485,000 in damages to a computer operator fired by Southern Pacific for refusing to take a random drug test. The National Labor Relations Board ruled that unions have a right to bargain over employer drug-test plans. Southwest Airlines fights a court order blocking its tests and calls the body of legal opinion on drug testing &quot;contradictory.&quot;    Many companies, such as Long Island Lighting Co., are undaunted, though they often limit tests to new hirees, annual physicals or for suspected drug abuse. Grumman Corp. sees no problem if its tests are &quot;fair.&quot; Rohr Industries Inc. says it reviewed legal questions before it began testing, to avoid hassles.    But Tandy Corp. delays any program while waiting &quot;for the dust to settle&quot; on legal concerns.    BARTENDERS LEARN to pour less, amid liability worries.    With the holiday drinking season upon us, more liquor servers are taking courses that stress limiting drinks before a customer has too much. The spur: a rise in state laws and court decisions holding bars and bartenders liable for auto crashes caused by drunk patrons. Some 200 server-training programs are offered, up from about six in 1982, says James Peters of Responsible Hospitality Institute, which promotes the training.    A recent court decision held both a Kentucky Eagles lodge and a bartender there liable for a drunk-driving crash that killed a policeman and injured another. &quot;Now, I'm responsible till my customer walks through his own front door,&quot; says Richard Devine, a Springfield, Mass., bartender and server-training graduate.    LABOR COST CONTROL stays high on the corporate agenda for 1988.    Hay Group consultants find that 20% of 660 organizations surveyed consider raising employees' contributions to health-care premiums; 32% increased that pay-in this year. Another 18% may boost the health-care deductible in 1988. The poll, taken at a pay meeting before the stock-market crash, showed that salary raises would ease about 0.2 percentage point from 1987 boosts, to a range of 4.5% to 5.4%; a poll today would produce &quot;lower numbers,&quot; Hay says.    Ford Motor Co. will cut overtime pay and trim medical benefits for staff. Half of 40 personnel officials surveyed by Hay in mid-November said they will use &quot;caution&quot; in granting pay increases, and most don't plan to make up for executives' loss of stock-option value in the crash. Instead, they will link pay more to company performance.    Bankers Note Inc., Atlanta retailer, moved to slash all wage and benefit costs, before the crash.    FOUL BALL? Minnesota Gov. Perpich gave many state workers an afternoon off to celebrate the Twins' World Series win. But some AFSCME locals filed grievances, saying the order unfairly denied time off to employees who weren't slated to work that afternoon, and to some part-time employees who lost hours of pay.    TO THE RESCUE: Fully 247 House members sent a letter to Attorney General Meese, protesting the Justice Department plan to seek federal takeover of the Teamsters Union. Teamsters President Jackie Presser, whose union lobbied for congressional help, says, &quot;This issue transcends politics.&quot;    SKIP THE HOLIDAYS for job hunting? It's a bad idea, placement firms say. Most people do, which means it's a good time for job seeking; and the job interview goes better amid holiday goodwill. Employers &quot;hire in December to implement start-up plans for the new year,&quot; adds executive search man Robert Snelling.    CROSSING THE BORDER would ease for engineers, consultants and others seeking to go north or south for brief jobs, under the new U.S.-Canada trade pact. Trade officials consulted the AFL-CIO, but a federation spokeswoman says unions remain opposed to relaxing the immigration rules.    FIRE WHEN READY, but do it with care, employers are warned.    The recent California airline crash, apparently caused by in-flight shooting by a fired employee, dramatized the perils of job terminations, placement experts say. They urge bosses to tell someone being fired that the change is for the best and to use counselors to talk to the person, and even to his family. One textile-fibers manager, afraid to tell his wife he'd been fired, faked going to work every day for four months.    Do it fast and don't bad-mouth the worker, or give long reasons, says James Challenger, Chicago placement executive. He says a major company once fired a worker on Christmas eve -- a poor choice. Asked why that day, the firing official said, &quot;I didn't want to think about it over the holiday.&quot;    &quot;Terminating somebody is a greater responsibility than hiring them,&quot; says Andrew Sherwood, a New York placement man.    THE CHECKOFF: The Communications Workers of America and Zendentsu, a Japanese telecommunications union, sign a mutual-support pact. . . . Carnegie Mellon University researchers develop a stick-type robot that simulates human balance, like standing on one &quot;foot&quot; to reach high places. . . . &quot;I do my best work on hold,&quot; says Deborah Reisner, a New York public-relations woman. &quot;Nobody bothers me when they see a phone in my ear.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
