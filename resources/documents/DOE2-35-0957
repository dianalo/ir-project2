Depth profiles of the as received double coatedfiber revealed concentration oscillations which disappeared after annealingthe fiber in the environment used to fabricate the composite. After thecomposite was fractured, the Auger depth profiles showed that failureoccurred in neither the Beta-SiC fiber body nor in the Si{sub 3}N{sub4} matrix but, concurrently, at the fiber coating/matrix interface andwithin the fiber coating itself.</TEXT></DOC>
