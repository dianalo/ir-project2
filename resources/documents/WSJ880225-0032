But Santa Fe's plan to pursue its restructuring must overcome a legal challenge by Henley. A hearing is scheduled for tomorrow in the Delaware Court of Chancery, where Henley is seeking, among other things, to block a Santa Fe special dividend.    In court papers filed Feb. 9, La Jolla, Calif.-based Henley argued that the dividends, which carry clauses that would restrict financial flexibility at Santa Fe, are an attempt to entrench the company's management.    In a letter to Henley, Santa Fe's president and chief executive officer, Robert D. Krebs, called the $17.50-a-share bid for the new stock an effort to gain control of the railroad, energy and real estate concern without paying a takeover premium to Santa Fe holders.    A spokesman for Henley said, &quot;We are disappointed but not surprised,&quot; by Santa Fe's rejection. The spokesman declined to elaborate.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Santa Fe closed yesterday at $24.25 a share, up 75 cents. Henley closed at $23.50 a share, up 75 cents in national over-the-counter trading. Henley priced its offer at $17.50 because it said the new stock wouldn't qualify for a $5-a-share cash dividend that Henley proposed as part of its restructuring.    &quot;The offer would dilute the interest of all of our shareholders except for Henley Group,&quot; Mr. Krebs said in the letter. The company said the purchase would have given Henley a 35% stake in Santa Fe and effective control of the company. Currently, Henley has a 15.7% interest in Santa Fe.    The Henley plan, made Monday, was seen as an attempt to put pressure on Santa Fe to accept a takeover proposal by the manufacturing, engineering and financial services concern.    The plan was proposed as an alternative to Santa Fe's planned payment of about $780 million in senior subordinated debt to shareholders. Santa Fe's payout of a special dividend of $25 in cash and $5 in debentures a share is an attempt to build support in the face of a potentially bitter proxy fight between the company and Henley.    Henley's proposal involved canceling the debenture payment and instead using the $780 million raised from the sale of stock to Henley to pay a $5-a-share cash dividend. The plan also was contingent on the removal of a shareholder rights defense, which currently would be triggered if a holder or group of holders were to hold more than a 20% stake in Santa Fe stock without the board's approval.    Santa Fe said in the letter that the payout would provide a better value to shareholders. &quot;Your proposal provides better value for the Henley shareholders at the expense of other Santa Fe Southern Pacific shareholders,&quot; the company said.    It added that it still intends to pay the special securities dividend next Tuesday to stock of record Feb. 5.    A spokesman for Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd., which holds a 10.5% stake in Santa Fe and has offered to raise its interest to 19.6%, declined to comment on Santa Fe's rejection of the Henley offer.    Separately, Olympia andamp; York SF Holdings Corp., an Olympia andamp; York unit said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it sent a letter on Feb. 16 to Santa Fe's board asking that Santa Fe amend its bylaws &quot;expressly electing that the company shall not be subject to the provisions of the new Delaware statute.&quot;    The Delaware law, passed last month, applies to offers that began after last Dec. 23 and would ban hostile acquirers from merging with target companies for three years after an offer is launched, except under certain conditions. For example, an acquirer can bypass the three-year restriction by purchasing at least 85% of a target company's stock in a single transaction.    It was believed that Olympia andamp; York has sought the exemption in order to boost its stake to 19.6% or higher without tripping the law's sanction against subsequent mergers after passing the 15% threshold. However, Santa Fe's exemption from Delaware's anti-takeover provisions might also aid other acquirers of the stock.    The Olympia andamp; York spokesman declined to comment on the letter.
