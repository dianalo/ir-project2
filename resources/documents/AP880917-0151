The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in an8-3 decision Friday, ruled that public interest lawyers areentitled to collect fees at the often-higher, prevailing rate whenthey successfully challenge federal government policies.   Under federal laws, the government must pay the legal fees ofthe winning side in a variety of challenges to federal statutes, asystem designed to encourage private initiatives to enforce thelaw. The government, however, has challenged the size of the fees.   Judges dissenting from the appellate decision asserted that theruling overturns a rational and efficient method for determiningfees, established by a ruling in 1984, and will ``create anenormous administrative burden for this court.''   A former assistant U.S. attorney who was involved inestablishing the rule that the government would reimburse lawyersat the rate normally charged by their law firms said the rulingwould create chaos.   ``How can you determine what the market price is?'' he asked,speaking on condition that he not be identified. ``Every law firmcharges a different hourly fee.''   The case arose after four lawyers successfully sued the InteriorDepartment, challenging laws that they said allowed huge miningcompanies to skirt environmental standards. The lawyers representedSave Our Cumberland Mountains Inc., a citizens group based inTennessee.   A U.S. district judge awarded them just under $200,000 in legalfees for the four-year legal battle, according to one of thelawyers. The government appealed.   A three-judge appellate panel ruled that the two lawyers shouldbe compensated at a lower rate of $100 an hour, finding that thedistrict court judge had erred in using the prevailing market rateto determine the legal fees.   U.S. Appeals Court Judge David B. Sentelle, in his opinion forthe majority, said the three-judge panel's ruling was``inconsistent with the intent of Congress in enacting fee awardstatutes'' and with Supreme Court rulings. From now on, he said,awards would be based on ``the prevailing market rate.''</TEXT></DOC>
