Experiments were carried out to demonstratethis technique employing a high flux reactor neutron beam using an HPGedetector and a scanning system which incorporates a BBC microcomputerfor control, data acquisition, image reconstruction and display. Neutrontomography of the same objects was also performed in order to correctthe emission tomography results for the neutron flux depression withinthe sample. The images produced represent the intensity of the inducedgamma-ray of interest, and hence the concentration of the isotope ofinterest.</TEXT></DOC>
