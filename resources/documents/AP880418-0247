(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new breed of leaner, faster-growing``designer'' livestock may soon take up residence in America's morefashionable barnyards.   The sheep, pigs and cattle of tomorrow will be given dailysupplements of growth-regulating hormones, synthetic versions ofproteins that naturally occur in animals.   Experiments at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's BeltsvilleResearch Center and elsewhere have shown that daily doses of thesynthetic hormones add up to greater yields of milk and meat.   While they have not yet been approved by the Food and DrugAdministration for commercial use, growth hormones have reducedfat, increased yields of lean meat and improved feed efficiency inthe laboratory.   Administered to mature dairy cows, growth hormones can increasemilk production by 20 percent, according to animal researcherNorman Steele.   On growing animals, the effects are more dramatic. ``Whensupplemented by increased dietary protein, we can create longer,bigger, leaner animals,'' Steele says.   In one recent experiment involving two 66-pound hogs, the animaltreated with growth hormones reached a goal weight of 130 poundstwo weeks faster than his untreated brother. At the end of the40-day experiment, the treated pig was 42 percent bigger.   He also was leaner. ``It takes fewer calories to make a pound oflean meat than it does to make a pound of fat,'' Steele says. ``Theuntreated hog required 2.6 pounds of feed per one pound of bodyweight gain. The treated hog required 1.96 pounds of feed to gain apound. To a farmer, that means a 30 percent increase in profits.''   The news appears to be good for consumers, as well. ``It's anatural product _ in people, it's digested. And we'll produce moremeat with less feed, which could bring prices down,'' says DouglasBolt, a USDA research physiologist.   Genetic engineering has enabled researchers to produce syntheticgrowth hormones at low prices. So far, daily injections are theonly known way of administering growth hormones, although the raceis on among drug companies to develop a slow-release deliverysystem.   Steele and other scientists are now researching the dietaryrequirements of the ``new'' pig, the latest in a series ofstreamlined models.   The effort to reduce fat and increase lean meat in hogs datesback to the emergence of vegetable oils, which began replacinganimals fats in Americans' diets in the '50s.   In addition to health considerations, ``we realized that fat isa very inefficient way of using expensive feed,'' Steele says. ``Wenow want that feed used to make meat.''   Efforts to rebuild the hog are among modern agriculturalscience's greatest triumphs, resulting in larger quantities of meatfrom animals whose longer, leaner bodies now yield a bonus: twoadditional pork chops and two extra ribs, the result of an addedvertebra.   Commercial use of growth hormone in hogs could make the processcomplete, making pork competitive with poultry, both in price andnutrition, says Steele.   ``However, there comes a point where you can't reduce fatanymore,'' he acknowledges. ``Bacon doesn't fry up and it's notvery flavorful. It's also much harder to slice.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 1</NOTE></DOC>
