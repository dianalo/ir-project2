The bill was passed in the hallowed name of civil rights. In the real world it will have the same effect as all the other spongy, open-ended laws the modern Congress enacts: petty harassment and dubious lawsuits. The Members seem to understand this. They have exempted Congress from Grove City's legal coverage.    Congress consistently passes laws that bind 240 million Americans and blithely exempts itself from their coverage. Such landmark laws as the Fair Labor Standards Act and the 1964 Civil Rights Act don't apply to Congress. Rep. Steve Bartlett tried this year and in 1984 to extend the Grove City bill to Congress. In 1984, he lost in the House by 277-125. This year, the Rules Committee denied him a floor vote.    We recently highlighted one example of Congress above the law -- the 200 employees in the House folding room who were working 70-hour weeks, without overtime pay, to process 30 million congressional newsletters and other mailings.    We're happy to report that the Folding Room 200 may have been granted relief. This month a House committee passed a measure by Rep. Bartlett to extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to some congressional employees, including those in the folding room sweatshop. It turns out, though, that Capitol Hill is like some musty old castle, where one room leads to yet another display of behavior the local villagers don't hear much about. Look at the folding room.    Rep. Mervyn Dymally, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, says there is a &quot;plantation relationship&quot; between workers and management. Management in this case is George F. Early, who has run the folding room since 1979. &quot;He's got people so scared of him that we speak in whispers about everything,&quot; one employee told Roll Call magazine. One would think Rep. Dymally would be gunning to replace Mr. Early with someone who could improve morale. But Mr. Dymally says he doesn't want that: &quot;We're dealing with the conditions, not with the person.&quot;    That struck us as curious until we learned that Mr. Early is the brother of Rep. Joseph Early, a Dymally colleague. This led us to wonder how many other relatives of Members work for Congress.    We found that in 1967, when 50 Members had their wives on staff, Congress passed a law prohibiting any public official from hiring a relative. But both UPI and Roll Call reported earlier this year that a form of &quot;loophole nepotism&quot; is alive and well: At least 80 congressional relatives have worked on Capitol Hill in the past 20 months. No restrictions apply if relatives work for Congress itself or for other Members, and UPI found some who were quite willing to put a colleague's kin on the payroll:   When Rep. Early's nephew Dennis left a $26,000-a-year job with Rep. Bob Traxler in 1986, it was Rep. Early's son Mark who replaced him. In 1986, Rep. Traxler also hired Stacey AuCoin, the daughter of Rep. Les AuCoin, as an office aide.    Rep. AuCoin's brother, Leland, in turn works for the House clerk. Rep. AuCoin also has provided paid internships for the daughters of Reps. Barbara Boxer and Carroll Hubbard. An AuCoin aide said it is &quot;common practice&quot; for Members to employ &quot;the kids of other congressmen.&quot; Insofar as more than 98% of House incumbents were returned to office in the last election, it shouldn't surprise anyone that the Members are turning Congress into a family business.    Consider Rep. Charlie Rose. The House ethics committee concluded this week that Rep. Rose borrowed money from his own campaign and used a certificate of deposit from the campaign as collateral on a personal loan. An executive-branch official would twist in the wind for similar actions, but the House's all-in-the-family ethics committee merely sent Rep. Rose a letter saying his behavior was &quot;deserving of reproach.&quot;    Mark Twain lampooned double standards when he quipped, &quot;To do good is noble. To advise others to do good is also noble, and much less trouble.&quot; If the Members had wanted to show their concern for civil rights when they overrode Mr. Reagan's veto of the Grove City bill, they would have started by freeing the Folding Room 200 and then living for a while by the laws they want the rest of America to obey. </TEXT></DOC>
