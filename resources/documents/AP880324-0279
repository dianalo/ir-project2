ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As George Bush amazed the pundits with apolitical resurrection, the Democrats lost a front-runner off thegood ship Monkey Business, staged what looked like candidate-a-weekauditions for a replacement and now worry about a conventionwithout a clear winner.   At its midpoint, the 1988 presidential campaign can claim morethan its share of unexpected twists and turns.   Without a front-runner, the lesser known Democrats found it hardto get attention and gain stature.   The race became ``a series of isolated judgments,'' said BillCarrick, campaign manager for Rep. Richard Gephardt. Carrickreferred to the phenomenon of no Democratic being able to puttogether a series of victories.   And as both parties looked ahead to November, they expressedpessimism.   ``This looks to me like 1960 all over again,'' said DonaldDevine, a conservative Republican and adviser to Kansas Sen. BobDole's presidential campaign. That was a year the Democratsrecaptured the White House at the close of Republican DwightEisenhower's second term.   Once again, said Devine, ``You have an aging president, who'skind of loved and recognized as doing a decent job.''   ``This is the Democrats' year,'' he lamented. ``The Republicansare going to have to work real hard to change that and theDemocrats are going to have to help them a little in thisnomination process, which I think they're going to do.''   Some Democrats agree that they could easily give the Republicanthe help they need.   Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York predicted there'll be somebrokering before the party's nominee can be selected, and he warnedthat if it takes place at the Democratic National Convention nextsummer in Atlanta ``the whole United States will see you in thegrubby business of cutting deals.''   Two Democrats _ Gary Hart and Joseph Biden _ were knocked out ofcontention long before any votes were cast. Television evangelistPat Robertson startled Republicans with his organizational skill,and even more with his accounts of conversations with God.   Southern Democrats tried to give their nominating process aconservative cast and created Super Tuesday which gave the biggestboost to a pair of liberals _ Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis.   Iowa's reputation took a beating and so did momentum.   Voters demonstrated repeatedly they don't always do what thepollsters predict they will.   And once again, money proved the indispensable element ofcampaigns for everybody but Jackson.   After Ronald Reagan, who?   Among Republicans, the debate centered on who could legitimatelyclaim his conservative legacy and retain some of his electoralmagic. For the most conservative element in the party, it also wasthe year to determine whether they or GOP moderates, represented byBush, would control the party in the post-Reagan era.   The Democrats looked forward to a presidential campaign withoutReagan on the ballot, but also were aware they had lost four of thelast five national elections, being virtually shut out in the Southand West.   They, too, talked of a fight for control of the party's future.   Both parties started out with bumper crops of candidates andnear candidates.   Remember Donald Rumsfeld? A former Illinois congressman, WhiteHouse chief of staff and defense secretary, he had a resume thatrivaled Bush's and a speaking style that was a sure cure forinsomnia. He appeared at Republican events around the countrytrying to drum up support for a presidential bid before finallygiving up on April 2, 1987.   Former Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, best known as Reagan's closefriend, also dipped a toe into the presidential waters but pulledit out when he discovered how tough it could be to raise millionsof dollars.   Conseratives were titillated by the prospect that Pat Buchanan,the former White House communications director, or JeaneKirkpatrick, the former United Nations ambassador would run. Botheventually said no.   The Democrats had their share of reluctant dragons.   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia considered running and then didn't;Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey said, no, no, a thousand times no.Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and his governor, Bill Clinton,decided against running. Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado wanted torun but found raising enough money too great a hurdle.   And then, of course, there was the ubiquitous Governor Cuomo ofNew York.   ``I will not be a candidate,'' Cuomo declared in 1987, settingoff still more speculation on whether or not he was running.   ``Why don't you want to be president?'' he was asked a yearlater.   ``Who said I don't want to be president?'' he retorted.   ``Do you want to be president?'' pressed the questioner.   ``No,'' he replied.   But there plenty of real candidates.   Bush, Dole, Robertson, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, former Gov.Pete du Pont of Delaware and former secretary of state Alexander M.Haig Jr. on the Republican side.   Hart, Biden, Dukakis, Jackson, Rep. Richard Gephardt ofMissouri, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt ofArizona and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee for the Democrats.   The race began early with Democrats Gephardt, Biden and Babbitttaking the traditional route throught the small towns of Iowa,campaigning for legislative candidates in the 1986 elections. Dole,Kemp and du Pont did much the same thing on the Republican side.   Meanwhile, Michigan Republicans tried to grab some of thepresidential campaign spotlight. In the summer of 1986, theyelected thousands of precinct level party officials who eventuallywould decide the allocation of the state's 77-member delegation tothe GOP convention in New Orleans in August 1988.   The Bush campaign liked the idea. The vice president beat Reaganin Michigan's 1980 primary.   But Robertson was already at work and his forces matched thevice president's at the crucial task of recruiting candidates forthe Michigan election. That was the first indication of Robertson'spotential.   It was bad news for Bush and even worse for Kemp.   Then came Iran-Contra and the disclosures that theadministration had been involved in covert arms sales to theAyatollah.   It was a bleak moment for the administration and it looked likeBush would be the principal political victim.   Dole's advisers were split on the likely impact, but the senatorwas among those who thought it would severely wound Bush.   ``I thought it was serious,'' said Lee Atwater, Bush campaignmanager. ``But I never thought it would deprive the vice presidentof the nomination.''   Iowa's economy would prove an even greater hurdle for Bush.   Throughout the Reagan presidency, things had gone from bad toworse in the state and it was one of the few soft spots in Reagan'sgenerally strong approval from Americans.   Dole campaigned there as a fellow Midwesterner with a ruralbackground and an understanding of the problems of farmers.   ``I'm from Russell, Kansas, and proud of it,'' he told countlessaudiences.   The campaign began to get nasty.   ``He's sort of had a charmed life in politics, he's gotten quitea ways without ever doing much,'' Dole said of the vice president.   As Dole continued to portray Bush as a vice president who had nomore than a passive role in administration affairs, the Bushcampaign accused the senator of being ``mean-spirited'' andpracticing ``cronyism.''   Dole later accused the Bush campaign of deliberately trying toprovoke him.   ``I think that was the effort,'' he said. ``I was a bit testy atime or two. I was getting angry.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
