They willcarefully graph the butt-twitching, fist-pumping, pelvis-grindingcome-and-get-it-baby moves. They will try to interpret the correlation betweenwomen's underwear and the pregnant pauses in the song &quot;What's New, Pussycat?&quot;They will puzzle over the role of sweat as a performance metaphor. And theywill come to one conclusion:;   Now this was a man.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  A NEW SHINE TO SWEATY JONES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Pop Music  </MEMO><TEXT>     Friday night, before an adoring full house at the Circle Star Center in SanCarlos, the 51-year-old Welsh paragon of masculinity punched his way through aworkmanlike 90-minute, 21-song set that included all the old cornballfavorites and a preview of what might be his richest work to date.;   Ageneration of children has been born, raised and sent through college in theyears since Tiger Tom bounded onto the pop scene with &quot;It's Not Unusual&quot; in'65. But the enduring appeal of this consummate pop jack-of-all-trades knowsno age limits. Friday night, the old-line matrons in their big Cadillacs andBuicks were out in force, along with the sharkskin-suited Vegas crowd and asurprisingly large contingent of dressed-for-distress post-teen mods androckers. They had all come to pay homage to the high priest of hip.;   Midwaythrough the set, the parade of female admirers -- ages 10 to 60 -- who soughta stage-side one-on-one audience with the Tomster became so unwieldy that hepaused to conduct a receiving line. It's not unusual. . . . A little kisshere, a coy peck there, and -- boom -- we're back in business.;   Let therecord show that when the dust finally settled, these items were on thecircular stage: six pairs of women's underwear, one pair of peach-coloredpantyhose, three love notes, more than a dozen floral arrangements and onebottle of Dom Perignon.;   Jones is the genuine item, a sincere and thoroughlyconvincing performer whose patchwork of schmaltzy pop, chugging rock andromantic ballads is held together by sheer force of personality. Hiscredibility with the over-50 crowd is so strong he can open with two pounding,brassy rock rave-ups (as he did Friday) and still provoke Beatlemania-strengthfits of shrieking out of the old guard.;   His credentials with the hip clubcrowd are equally impressive, due in large part to a young generation of discjockeys who constantly use his old records as a form of comic irony. Andunlike the Engelbert Humperdincks and Barry Manilows of this world, Jones is abona-fide rocker who's forever forging new alliances -- with Prince, thePogues, the Art of Noise and a legion of other forward-looking rockers.;  Predictably, Friday night's audience reserved its strongest approval for thestandards -- &quot;What's New, Pussycat?&quot; &quot;The Green, Green Grass of Home,&quot;&quot;Delilah&quot; and &quot;Never Fall in Love Again.&quot; But the new Van Morrison-pennedmaterial off Jones' current album, &quot;Carrying a Torch,&quot; was nothing short ofspectacular.;   The marriage of Jones' larger-than-life baritone (which was infair-to-middling shape) and Morrison's Celtic soul is one made in rock 'n'roll heaven. His glowing, inspired delivery of &quot;Carrying a Torch&quot; and &quot;SomePiece of Mind&quot; far overshadowed his work on the older material. Of the fournew numbers he trotted out Friday, only &quot;Killer on the Sheets&quot; -- a grungyrocker best suited for the likes of Alice Cooper -- fell short of the mark.;  To say Jones is a very physical performer is a great understatement -- heworks like plow horse. His bumps and grinds were coarse enough to make aMadonna fan blush. After casting off his purple double-breasted blazer 10songs into the set, he spent the remainder of the night with sheets of sweatpouring off his black slacks and black shirt like rain off a tin roof.;   Youcould get sweaty just watching this guy -- and I'm sure a few people did.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID PLOTNIKOFF, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911021  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  700  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, October 21, 199100295030,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
