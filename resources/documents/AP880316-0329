Under the $6 billion deal, the venture would build and operate apetrochemical complex off the Caspian Sea in the Central Asianrepublic of Kazakhstan. It is expected to produce 400,000 tons ofpolypropylene, 600,000 tons of polyethylene and more than 1 milliontons of granulated sulfur annually.   Polypropylene and polyehylene are used to make plastics.   The foreign partners are Occidental Petroleum Corp. of LosAngeles, the Italian companies of Montedison and Enichem andMarubeni of Japan.   Officials of the four companies signed a preliminary agreementwith Soviet representatives on Wednesday, committing them to studyplans for the petrochemical complex for nine months beforecompleting a long-range contract.   Montedison Chairman Raul Gardini said the Soviets had invitedthe four companies to establish the joint venture.   ``It reflects the necessity for the Soviet Union to get involvedin the world market and the necessity for Western firms to getcloser to sources of raw materials in order to process them moreefficiently at the sites,'' he said.   The Soviet Union has vast natural resources, and is the world'slargest oil producer.   Vassily A. Dinkov, Soviet oil minister, told a news conferencethat housing for the petrochemical workers, roads, a railroad link,electricity and communications facilities are under constructionfor the complex, which will be built near the western Kazakh townof Kulsary.   Under the agreement, Dinkov said, gas and oil extractionfacilities are to be operating next year, with refining plantsfollowing within the next few years. Oil reserves in the deposit,known as the Tengiz Oil Field, are estimated at between 14 billionand 17.5 billion barrels, Dinkov said.   Foreign participants will hold a total of no more than 49percent of the joint venture's capital, with the rest held by theSoviet government.   Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer told the news conference eachof the foreign partners will invest $750 million in the project,and the Soviets will put in $3 billion. The Western partners willutilize bank financing, he said.   Previous joint ventures, which have sprung up under Mikhail S.Gorbachev's overhaul of the Soviet economy, have been worth in themillions of dollars.   The foreign partners will sell half the complex's productsabroad. The Soviets will sell the other half, either domesticallyor on the world market.   Hammer, whose business ties with the Soviets date to the 1920s,expressed confidence that the Western partners will find the dealfinancially satisfying.   ``We're not here for charitable purposes,'' he said. ``We, eachof the four companies, expect to make profits.''</TEXT></DOC>
