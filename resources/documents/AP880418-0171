Col William R. Higgins was killed by hiskidnappers this month after several weeks in captivity.   United Nations officials said they had heard nothing to confirmthe report by the Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon.   The station, which has broadcast several inaccurate reportsabout the hostages in Lebanon, said Higgins was ``killed and buriedby his captors'' early this month in Siddiqine, a village in southLebanon.   Higgins was serving with the U.N. Interim Force in south Lebanonwhen he was kidnapped near the southern port of Tyre on Feb. 17.   Timur Goksel, the spokesman for the U.N. group, said Monday:``We have no such information, and therefore we cannot comment onthe radio report.''   ``We have checked with our sources, and everybody was surprisedwhen they heard about the report,'' he added in a telephoneinterview from the U.N. group's headquarters in Naqoura on theLebanese-Israeli border.   At U.N. headquarters in New York, spokeswoman Nadia Younes toldreporters that UNIFIL had checked with its sources and found noconfirmation of the broadcast.   The radio said Higgins was killed hours before pro-Syrianmilitiamen of Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal militia capturedSiddiqine from supporters of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, apparentlyto keep Amal from claiming credit for his liberation.   Amal and Hezbollah spokesmen in Beirut did not comment on thereport. The two groups have been at odds since Higgins, 43, ofDanville, Ky., was kidnapped.   Siddiqine, 10 miles southeast of Tyre, was a Hezbollahstronghold before Amal crushed its Shiite Moslem fundamentalistrivals in a four-day battle early this month.   Amal supports the presence of the U.N. peacekeeping force inpredominantly Shiite south Lebanon. Hezbollah, or the Party of God,opposes it.   Amal has charged that Hezbollah masterminded Higgins' abductionto undermine Amal's control of south Lebanon.   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for factions holdingmost of the 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon. It has not claimed tohold any foreign hostages.   Higgins' abduction was claimed by a group calling itself theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth, which charged that he was aCIA spy. Both the United States and United Nations have denied thecharge.   Amal spokesmen had said their fighters found no trace of Higginsin any of the Hezbollah strongholds they captured.   The foreigners missing and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon arenine Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, one Irishman, oneItalian, one West German, one Indian, and two unidentified men.   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
