(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Suffolk County Legislature overrode the county executive's veto and enacted a bill regulating the use of video display terminals in business.    The vote was 13-5. Twelve votes were needed to override.    The bill requires businesses with 20 or more terminals to meet safety standards, such as non-glare screens. Rest breaks are required for those working more than 26 hours a week at such screens. Employers must pay 80% of the cost of eye exams and eyeglasses.    County Executive Patrick Halpin had vetoed the bill, saying it would hurt the county's economic growth by dissuading businesses from locating in Suffolk. Business groups said they feared the loss of 3,000 jobs.    Mr. Halpin said he was disappointed by the override and vowed to &quot;do my best to implement this law so that it has the minimal impact on our business community.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
