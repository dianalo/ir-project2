Issuance. Crop Genetics International, 7170 Standard Drive,Hanover, MD 21076. This EUP allows the inoculation of a <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subspecies <T3>cynodontis </T3>bacterium that has been genetically engineered to containa <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis </T3>delta endotoxin gene (Cxc/Bt) into cornseedlings to evaluate the efficacy of this organism as a plant associatedinsecticidal agent against the European corn borer, and to obtain furtherknowledge on the behavior of this organism in the environment. The totalacreage authorized in this EUP is 4 acres with approximately 2 acres inIngleside, Maryland and approximately 2 acres in Beltsville, Maryland.5andmultiply;1016 organisms have been authorized for shipment to each site.The EUP is effective from May 24, 1988 to May 24, 1989. This EUP was issuedsubject to several limitations, among which is the requirement that thecrop be destroyed or used for research purposes only.CGI tested at the two Maryland locations in the spring of 1988. Cxc/Btwas injected into corn plants which will be studied through the summerand fall. The parental strain of <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subspecies cynodontis (Cxc) was isolated fromBermuda grass in Westover, Maryland (CGI isolate number MD69a).The Agency evaluated potential adverse effects on nontarget species thatconceivably might occur as a result of this small-scale test. This evaluationalso included an assessment of the potential exposure this microorganismmight exhibit to the nontarget species.The Agency has concluded that the potential to affect nontarget organismsis not of concern for this small-scale field test. The reasons follow.The inherent properties of Cxc and the results of the infectivity and pathogenicitytests in mice submitted by CG indicate that there are not likely to behuman health risks. Cxc grows slowly at 34anddegrees;C and does not growat 36anddegrees;C; normal human body temperature is 37anddegrees;C. The deltaendotoxin from <T3>B. thuringiensis </T3>var. <T3>kurstaki </T3>has been extensively studied and there has been no indicationof any health problems. In addition, all crops will be used for researchpurposes or destroyed so there will be no dietary exposure to humans.The genetic alterations are not likely to enhance any potential plant pathogenicproperties of the <T3>C. xyli cynodontis </T3>parental strain which occurs naturally in Maryland.This experiment will not appreciably increase the quantity of the parentalstrain or the quantity of the delta endotoxin already occurring naturallyin the environment, nor will it appreciably alter the distribution of thedelta endotoxin as produced by <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis. </T3>In addition, CGI has shown that Cxc/Bthas a relatively low order of toxicity to susceptible insects.CGI has demonstrated that the toxin gene will eventually be irreversiblylost from the parental Cxc strain, and that the revertant and/or parentalCxc strains that have lost the toxin gene will outgrow the engineered strainso that, for the limited quantity used in this small-scale field test,the Cxc/Bt will not persist in the environment.The Agency has assessed the probability that the <T3>B. thuringiensis </T3>toxin gene could be transferred to other microorganisms.CGI submitted tests which indicated that Cxc had no mechanism for naturally-occurringgenetic transfer. Accordingly, the Agency has concluded that the probabilityof transfer of this gene is extremely remote.Furthermore, the Agency has concluded that the exposure of Cxc/Bt to nontargetspecies will be minimal since stringent containment, monitoring, and contingencyprocedures will be followed. Thus the environmental spread of Cxc/Bt willbe limited from this small-scale field test.CGI submitted data indicating that, although Cxc can infect many plantsafter direct inoculation (an infective dose for corn was demonstrated at100 CFU/plant), it does not appear to persist naturally in certain susceptibleplants surveyed by CGI in the field. It has been shown to occur naturallyin Bermuda grass. In addition, the incidence of transmission of Cxc fromartificially colonized corn plants seems to be very low. CGI has shownthat there is no gross colonization of sugarcane from infected Bermudagrass and no gross colonization of Bermuda grass or bindweeds in fieldsof Cxc-colonized corn. It is not likely to persist at levels that couldinfect plants in water or soil. This conclusion is supported by studiesshowing that corn was not infected by high levels of Cxc in soil, bothin the laboratory and in the field. Overall, the data indicate that theremay be an avenue for limited movement of the Cxc to other plants, particularlyby mechanical transfer, i.e. by cutting tools, or by transmission throughseed, but the rate of movement is of a low order and the containment, monitoring,and contingency plans will be adequate to control potential movement fromthe test site.The Agency has specified procedures to minimize spread of Cxc/Bt beyondthe test site. The field test design includes buffer zones, barriers tocontain runoff, and fencing. The protocols include tool disinfection, destructionof all seed, monitoring, and contingency plans to minimize any transferto other plants, and prevent the transfer to subsequent crops.The Agency issued an announcement of receipt of EUP application in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 26, 1988 (53 FR 2641). The nonconfidentialbusiness information portions of the application were made available forpublic comment at that time. In addition, the Agency's March 25, 1988,Preliminary Scientific Position was made available for public comment atthe time it was sent to an <T3>ad hoc</T3> subcommittee of the EPA Biotechnology Science AdvisoryCommittee (BSAC) for their review and comment.All commenters, except for one, agreed with the Agency's conclusion thatno significant risk to humans or to nontarget organisms could be foreseenfrom this small-scale field test.Several commenters, while not objecting to permit issuance, expressed reservationsabout the adequacy of the existing data base to support future testingconducted on a large-scale. The BSAC also expressed some concern regardingthis issue. The Agency shared some of these concerns and informed the applicantof this situation. The Agency focused on assessment of risk for this well-containedsmall-scale field test.Several substantive comments were directly related to the proposed small-scaletest. One commenter stated that CGI did not follow Good Laboratory Practice(GLP) regulations when they tested the identity, purity, strength, andcomposition of the test substance. In fact, CGI stated in the submissionthat it did not possess a formal independent Quality Assurance Unit asprovided in the GLP regulations. For this reason, the Agency conductedan audit of these studies on May 17, 1988. The purpose of the audit wasto determine the validity of the subject studies, and establish a chainof custody concerning the product tested between CGI and MicrobiologicalAssociates, which had performed the toxicology studies. This audit confirmedthat while CGI did not possess a formal quality assurance unit, the studieswere conducted under more than adequate control and are considered valid.One commenter questioned the validity of the data waivers requested bythe applicant. The regulations concerning the data requirements (40 CFRPart 158) allow for such waivers if the applicant can demonstrate thatthe requirements are not applicable. The waivers requested by CGI werereviewed by the Agency and found to be reasonable. Prior to submittingthe application, CGI met with the Agency on several occasions to discussspecific studies which would be required to support the experimental program.As a part of this process, several studies not listed in Part 158 wererequested by OPP and supplied by CGI.One concern expressed at the BSAC subcommittee meeting was the abilityto protect plants in surrounding areas from the runoff of water after rainfall.Specifically, the subcommittee recommended that EPA set a standard forthe construction of a dike around the plot area, and gave us an example,one which would be effective to withstand a severe rain event with an occurrencefrequency of 1 in 10 years. The Agency has considered the BSAC suggestionand has made the construction of a dike (berm) a requirement associatedwith permit issuance.It is the Agency's view that the data requirements needed to support anEUP have been adequately satisfied and that a point has been reached inthe research and development of this product where small-scale field studiesare warranted. Remaining questions on efficacy and questions regardingpossible environmental effects of Cxc/Bt products can best be answeredby conducting a carefully controlled and monitored small-scale study. TheAgency believes that, although issues of potential hazards from the releaseof genetically engineered microbial pesticides have been raised, thoseissues have been satisfactorily addressed by information provided by CGIand other relevant sources. This conclusion is based on reviews from theAgency scientific staff and recommendations from the <T3>ad hoc</T3> subcommittee of the BSAC. It is the Agency's consideredoption that approval and issuance of this EUP under the conditions imposedwill not result in adverse effects on humans or the environment. There,the Agency has issued this EUP.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edwin F.
