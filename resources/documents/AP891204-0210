This time it's Roseanne Barr who shows those vengeful gentsthe kind of hell that a scorned woman can administer.   Barr is the dull, slovenly, accident-prone wife of Ed BegleyJr., an ambitious New York accountant with amazing tolerance forher many failings. They include running their suburban home like acity slum and mismanaging their two overbearing children.   When the couple attends a gallery opening in Manhattan, he fallsinto the clutches of a man-hungry, self-adoring writer of romancenovels, Meryl Streep. Weary of her live-in gigolo, she decides togive the accountant her business and her love.   Barr slowly realizes her husband has been led astray. She boilswith Mephistophelean wrath, vowing to rob him of everything heholds dear: his family life, his career, his new love, his freedom.Her methods are as far-fetched as they are hilarious.   Full-out farce such as ``She-Devil'' requires a featherydirectorial touch and the most delicate of playing. SusanSeidelman's direction is on target most of the way, maintaining awhirlwind pace that forestalls suspension of belief. The script byMark R. Burns and Barry Strugatz is cleverly constructed, thoughsome of the comedy is misdirected (example: the spoofing ofsenility in a retirement sanitarium).   The movie is based on the novel, ``The Life and Loves of aShe-Devil,'' by Fay Weldon. Set in Britain, the novel was made intoa critically acclaimed TV miniseries telecast by PBS.   The big news in ``She-Devil'' is Streep's emergence as aworld-class comedy actress. She attacks the role of the vain,foolish novelist with a skilled gusto that invites comparison tothe great Lucille Ball. Streep is delicious in her cunningcalculation and convulsively funny when her champagne world losesits fizz.   Another revelation is Ed Begley Jr., heretofore known for expertcharacter roles in films (``The Accidental Tourist'' and ``ScenesFrom the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills'') and as theself-centered doctor of television's ``St. Elsewhere.'' Tall andclunky with unruly straw-colored hair, he is the ideal foil for themarvelous Streep.   ``She-Devil'' marks Barr's film debut following her rapid riseas a standup comedian and television star. It would be nice toreport that she scores another triumph. Alas, she seems uneasy andtentative in her role as the vindictive wife, as if wondering wherethe jokes are. With more expert handling, she can undoubtedlyregister on the big screen. Next time, Roseanne.   The Orion release is rated PG-13, for mild swearing andsuggestive situations.
