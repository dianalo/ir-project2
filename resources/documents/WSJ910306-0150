The free-for-all is likely to begin in June when ToshibaCorp. says it will become the first company to offer portablecomputers with a built-in cellular modem, a device thatenables telephone carriers to transmit data from one computerto another. By the fall, many other portable makers areexpected to match Toshiba.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Almost every major computer company is taking a seriouslook at integrating a cellular modem with {its} portables,&quot;says Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of CreativeStrategies International, a Santa Clara, Calif.,market-research company.   Embracing cellular technology is the first step towardcreating a &quot;personal communicator,&quot; a product that wouldcombine elements of the notebook-sized computer, electronicorganizers such as Sharp's Wizard and the ever-smallercellular telephone. As envisioned by its proponents, thegadget would fit inside a coat pocket and be capable ofsending and receiving data over a cellular network. It alsowould function as a sort of electronic Man Friday,automatically taking phone messages, updating simple programsand files, prompting its owner about upcoming meetings anddisplaying information on tiny liquid-crystal screens.   &quot;The marketplace would like us to do this. Now ourchallenge is to figure out how to marry these technologies,&quot;says Genelle Trader, director of portable systems marketingfor AST Research Inc., an Irvine, Calif., computer maker.   Observers aren't sure how quickly the market for personalcommunicators will emerge. Backers of the concept note thatmillions of both electronic organizers and cellular phonesare sold annually. But skeptics claim that a hybrid devicemight not catch on.   &quot;In the past, there have been many attempts to integratethe desk-top computer with the {wired} phone. None of thosewere successful,&quot; says Philippe Ribeyre, vice president,product-line management, for Zenith Data Systems, a U.S.computer maker owned by France's Groupe Bull. &quot;Attempts to dothe same with {wireless} devices also will fail.&quot;   Despite the risks, many companies seem willing to gambleon personal communicators. Makers of cellular phones want apiece of the action. And some of the loudest boosters of thepersonal communicator are cellular carriers who stand tobenefit greatly from increased data traffic; today, cellularnetworks carry almost exclusively voice connections.   At the moment, customers wanting to send and receive datawith cellular connections must cobble together a customsolution using an &quot;external&quot; modem. John Rule, president ofSpectrum Cellular Corp., a modem maker, says these current&quot;speciality&quot; solutions often are still dogged by glitches andincompatibilities with the cellular network. He expects themore convenient built-in modem to work more smoothly and addonly about $400 to $500 to the price of a portable computer.   Advances in modems come just as cellular carriers arebeefing up their own networks, adding capacity by swappingpuny analog switches with digital equipment designed to pushboth voice and data more efficiently and economically. Inanalog systems, voice transmissions can withstand a certainamount of static or interruptions. Similar problems, however,can corrupt a flow of data; as a result, &quot;today, datatransmission is inefficient and actually overloading{cellular} systems,&quot; says Miklos Korodi, chief executiveofficer at Cellular Data Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.   It won't be until next year, at the earliest, thatpersonal communicators hit the market. And when they dobecome available, a wide variety of uses is envisioned forthem. For example, they might receive, send and display faxmessages or electronic-mail; or they might run softwareprograms that, say, provide detailed information for avisitor to a strange city and catalog his expenses.   &quot;There's a strong desire in the market for a mix ofpersonal information and communication,&quot; says Jean LouisGassee, who departed as Apple Computer Inc.'s product chieflast year. &quot;In time, this will be a major segment of thecomputer market, but it needs new technology that's far fromtrivial.&quot;   Apple, for one, is hunting for the new technology. TheCupertino, Calif., company is backing an effort by two topengineers from the team that designed Apple's originalMacintosh computer. Last year, the engineers, who won'tcomment on their venture, formed General Magic Inc. inMountain View, Calif. With financial support from Apple andengineering help from Sony Corp., the fledgling company isconsidered likely to be among the first to produce a personalcommunicator.   Sony is readying its first cellular phones forintroduction this spring. &quot;Its natural for cellular tosupport computing services,&quot; says Michael Lang, marketingmanager, telecommunication products, for Sony Corp. ofAmerica. &quot;Having the ability to send data back and forth whenyou're in your car and walking around . . . will change thewhole nature of how you access information.&quot;   Sony forsees offering an entire line of personalcommunicators. &quot;The trick is making it easy to use andunderstand,&quot; Mr. Lang says, adding that it isn't likely anysingle device will satisfy everyone. &quot;We make 41 models ofthe Walkman,&quot; he says, referring to Sony's popular portableaudio and video players. &quot;The features vary according to lifestyles. You're going to see communications {devices} evolvein the same way.&quot;   Not all cellular-equipment makers are as enthusiasticabout the merger of cellular phones with portable computers.James Caile, vice president, marketing, for Motorola Inc.'scellular-equipment group, says the company has no plans toincorporate computing functions into its cellular phones,though Motorola does sell stand-alone computers. Even ifcustomers wanted a multifunction personal communicator, itmight prove too costly for some price-sensitive cellularshoppers, he says, adding: &quot;You cannot afford to load downevery unit with additional functionality.&quot;   Nevertheless, some manufacturers seem determined to try,and cellular carriers stand ready to help. While they have noplans to make personal comunicators, cellular carriers areeager to see new gadgets that might spur more cellulartraffic by their customers. Already, a unit of BellSouthCorp. is working with Sony on producing personalcommunicators.   More alliances seem likely. McCaw Cellular CommunicationsInc., the largest U.S. cellular-phone supplier, says it isholding exploratory discussions with Apple regarding thecharacteristics of personal communicators.   Craig McCaw, McCaw's chief executive, envisions thepersonal communicator as the linchpin for futurecellular-telephone networks. He acknowledges his hopes wereinspired by Apple, which several years ago made a video abouta visionary, and thus far unrealized, device called theKnowledge Navigator. The pocket-sized device, whichsymbolizes the hopes of promoters of the personalcommunicator, receives and stores information like aconventional computer. It also alerts its owner -- in spokenEnglish -- about incoming calls, sorts messages, updatesschedules and even retrieves data in response to queries.   Mr. McCaw is quick to caution that the functions performedby the Knowledge Navigator are years, if not, decades away.But in the meantime, he concedes that a merger of two red-hotmobile technologies -- cellular telephone and notebookcomputing -- is well under way.   Mr. Gassee, the former Apple official, agrees. &quot;Mobilecomputing and mobile voice and data transmission are anatural match,&quot; he says, adding: &quot;Yet that doesn't mean thatin the future all phones will be computers. It does, however,mean that without waiting for the technological messiah,today's phones can be made more useful.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
