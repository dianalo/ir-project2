The rate had remained at 6.7% for three months, the Labor Department said. Using a separate measure that counts the military among the employed, the rate dropped to 6.5% from 6.6% in February.    The report showed, however, that nonfarm payroll employment rose a lackluster 164,000 last month after a revised 236,000 increase the month before. The February increase was originally reported as 337,000.    Moreover, the employment increase occurred entirely in the service sector. Factory jobs declined by 24,000 after a 46,000 increase the month before. There was a decline in the average workweek for all nonfarm workers as well as for factory workers.    &quot;This is a generally weak report all around,&quot; said Robert Wescott, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia. &quot;It's a break in the momentum that we've built up in the past couple of months.&quot;    Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told Congress's Joint Economic Committee that &quot;job growth continued in March, but at a somewhat slower pace than in recent months.&quot;    Still, some economists contended the figures may overstate the economic softness. Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, noted that earlier reports were distorted by unseasonably warm weather in some regions and unusual retail hiring patterns, among other factors. He suggested that the March weakness may reflect a correction following those aberrations.    Taking the past few months together, Mr. Dederick said, &quot;the economy is continuing to move at a poke-along pace, but it is moving upward.&quot; He added that growth in the first quarter probably was considerably better than the 1.1% annual rate of the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department will release its initial estimate of first-quarter growth later this month.    Mr. Wescott said he expects the March softness to be temporary.    Last month, overall goods-producing employment fell 68,000 after a 32,000-job rise in February. The department said the decline in factory jobs was concentrated in motor vehicles and electrical and electronic equipment. Construction employment fell 47,000 after a 15,000-job decline the month before. Mining employment, which includes the oil and gas extraction industry, rose 3,000 after a 1,000-job rise.    In the service sector jobs rose by 232,000 after a 204,000-job increase in February. Business and health services, finance, insurance and real estate showed strong gains.    The agency's survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, found that civilian employment actually fell by 14,000. The labor force fell by 127,000, however, so the jobless rate declined. In February, jobs increased 371,000 and the labor force rose 315,000 (see chart on page one).    The unemployment rate for Hispanics fell to 9% from 9.6% in February and 10.6% in January. Mrs. Norwood said additional data are needed to determine whether there's a trend, however. The rate for blacks fell to 13.9% from 14.3% but remained more than twice the rate for whites, which fell to 5.6% from 5.7%.    The average workweek for nonfarm workers fell to 34.8 hours from 35. The factory workweek fell to 40.9 hours from 41.2, although factory overtime rose to 3.7 hours from 3.6.    Average hourly earnings rose to $8.89 from $8.86. The department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, increased to 171.8% of its 1977 average from 171.4%.
