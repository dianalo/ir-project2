The evaluations are based on analysis of experimentaldata and results of model calculations which reproduce the experimentaldata. Evaluated data are given for neutron induced reaction cross sections,angular and energy distributions, and for gamma-ray production crosssections associated with the reactions. File 6 formats are used to representenergy-angle correlated data and recoil spectra. Uncertainty files areincluded for the major cross sections. Detailed evaluations are givenfor /sup 58/60/Ni, and results of calculations for the major reactionsare used for evaluations of the minor isotopes. 29 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
