(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Perhaps the least of thechallenges facing the private school that proclaims itself ``thepearl of the Midwest'' is explaining to parents why it's worth$12,000 annual tuition.   The 300-acre campus of Cranbrook Kingswood School outsideDetroit has the requisite prep-school luxuries: a hockey arena,bowling alleys, indoor and outdoor tennis courts where players'strokes are videotaped, and an old-time swimming hole called LakeJonah, so named because it's shaped like a whale.   For its 800 students, each day is an aesthetic feast _ from thetapestries and art deco light fixtures down to the very doorknobsand lunchroom chairs. These, and practically everything else, weredesigned or influenced by famed Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen,who lived and taught here from 1925 to his death in 1950.   But just as the virtues of top private schools like this aren'tjust skin-deep, neither are the problems.   With the school-age population declining and prep schooltuitions sometimes rivaling Ivy League colleges, officials worryabout future enrollments and are casting their recruiting nets fromcoast to coast.   The nation's approximately 1,700 independent private schools,those not receiving tax or church funds, enroll some 600,000students, up 9.7 percent over the last decade.   But the number of students taking private school admissionstests dropped by 14 percent in the last two years, according to theNational Association of Independent Schools.   A few years ago, Cranbrook Kingswood could almost fill itsclasses with students just from Michigan and surrounding Midwesternstates. Now the school recruits from as far away as southernFlorida and California.   ``If we didn't do that kind of thing we wouldn't be in goodshape in five years because of the demographics. The best schoolsare out there all the time,'' said admissions director BruceKridler, whose travel budget has risen from $500 to $15,000 inrecent years, and who now makes routine visits to 35 cities in 17states.   Like other prep schools, Cranbrook Kingswood has constantlyfought a perception of elitism. The formerly all-white,predominantly Episcopalian school is now 25 percent Jewish and 25percent ``persons of color'' including Indians, Asian-Americans andblacks, a change due largely to aggressive minority studentrecruiting and a $15.8 million endowment that helps make sizablescholarships possible.   Cranbrook Kingswood is the most expensive boarding school inMichigan, and among the most expensive in the Midwest. But it is abargain compared with the priciest Eastern schools.   Leland Academy, in Franklin, Mass., is the nation's mostexpensive private college preparatory school, charging $18,500 fora year's tuition, fees, room and board. Cranbrook Kingswood, at$12,000, ranks 44th in the nation.   Another stubborn problem is finding minority teachers. Of 90upper-school faculty members, four are black, one is Hispanic, oneis Asian-American.   But such challenges seem remote at 8 a.m. as English teacherPeter Fayroian poured the coffee in his carpeted classroom for adozen students, about half the size of most public school classes.   He kicked off a discussion on the religious and moralimplications of Herman Hesse's classic ``Siddhartha'': ``Should weprepare to come to the presence of the holy on a motorcycle?'' heasked. ``What should be the relationship between technology and theholy?''   In Russ Conner's biology lab, nine juniors toil on a typicallycomplex question: At what wavelengths does chlorophyll in plantsabsorb the most light?   ``They use a college text,'' Conner said. ``And I don't givethem a whole lot of answers.''   ``Academically I've never seen anything like it,'' said JerryRubino from nearby Sterling Heights, Mich., whose daughter Lisa isan 11th-grade day student. ``Public school kids might come home at2:30 or 3 in the afternoon, but my daughter typically isn't homeuntil 6 or 7 at night, and then she buries herself in the books.''   It's a school rule that the 270 boarding students must be intheir rooms studying every evening Sunday through Thursday.   Upon graduation, each student's name is hand-carved into the oakwalls of Alumni Court. Those names include such luminaries asWyoming Senator Alan K. Simpson; Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked thePentagon Papers; poet Brad Leithauser, and New Republic editorMichael Kinsley.   Nonetheless, schools that tout themselves as training groundsfor future leaders in an increasingly diverse world simply can'tignore the issues of race and ethnicity any longer, said schoolpresident and acting director Lillian Bauder.   Yet private schools remain overwhelmingly white, according tothe NAIS's own statistics. In 1986-87, independent schoolenrollments were 4.7 percent black, 1.8 percent Hispanic, 4.7percent Asian-American and 0.1 percent Native American.   ``I recruit in Cabrini Green,'' said Kridler, referring to anall-black Chicago housing project, ``and I go to Mexican-Americanneighborhoods.   ``Inner city kids think we're not affordable. I talk a lot aboutfinancial aid opportunities,'' Kridler said.   About 24 percent of students in the upper school, grades 9-12,get financial aid, covering two-thirds of need on average. Still,22 students accepted last year did not enroll for money reasons.   Low teacher salaries remain a source of frustration, especiallyfor younger faculty, even though median salaries have risen $7,000in five years. Nationally, beginning private school teachers make$12,000-19,000 and average salaries for all such teachers was$23,000, about $5,000 less than public school teachers.   Fayroian, a 25-year-old first-year teacher, earns $16,300. Hesays he is up at 4 a.m. and in bed at midnight, spending his dayand evening grading papers, teaching classes and meeting withstudents. The salary ``can be disheartening for the amount of workwe do,'' he said.   Top scale at Cranbrook Kingswood is $34,000, and the median is$25,600. There's no teacher union and no tenure.   On the other hand, private school teachers generally have morefreedom to choose textbooks and shape their lessons free ofbureaucratic interference.   At Cranbrook Kingswood, the resulting curriculum is so rigorousmany students find college easy by comparison. The school recentlystudied its recent graduates and found their freshman grades oftenimproved compared with their grades at Cranbrook Kingswood.Students who averaged 2.0 to 2.5 at the prep school averaged 2.86as college freshmen, for example.   What makes the grind worth it is the extraordinarily highprobability of admission to one of the better U.S. colleges.   Of 190 graduates in 1987, 187 went to college, 14 as nationalmerit finalists. Their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores averaged1100 of a possible 1600, compared with a national average of 906.   Mark Botvinick, a 17-year-old senior from Bloomfield Hills,whose public schools lead the state, nonetheless chose to come hereand was recently granted early acceptance at his dream school, DukeUniversity.   Denise Brainard, a 12th grader from Crosslands, W.Va., saysthere's no comparison between what she gets here and what she wouldhave gotten at her hometown school.   ``Private schools are very stereotyped,'' she said. ``Peoplethink they're very snobby. But we're not; we come here for theeducation. I don't know what my chances would have been at NitroHigh School in Crosslands, W.Va.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, May 4</NOTE></DOC>
