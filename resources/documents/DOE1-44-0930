Ostroj is currently producing 15-20 plows per annum. Describesdevelopment work currently being undertaken, including design of thePL 82-1 plow for very thin seams (0.5 m): it uses 26 mm or 30 mm chains,is 380 mm high and requires minimal maintenance. Future developmentswill be concerned with automation involving new electronic and hydrauliccontrol devices. 2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
