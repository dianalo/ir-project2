Such loans were suspended after the bloody clash in Beijing on June 4.    So far, only a few loans have been announced, although some others are believed to have been quietly negotiated. Of those made public, one was to finance the purchase of a passenger jet and one was for the construction of a power station.    Most bankers are waiting for the World Bank to provide an international vote of confidence by resuming its funding. The World Bank's president, Barber Conable, recently said that although he hoped the bank would be able to resume lending to China soon, any decision would be delayed until after this month's Communist Party Central Committee meeting.    Bankers are drawn to China by the view that the country's cheap and abundant labor gives it significant potential. But in light of last June's events, they probably will be choosier about the projects they consider, and borrowing costs are likely to rise.    JAPANESE SALES TAX    Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, cheered by a landslide by-election victory for his party, said his government would review, but wouldn't abolish, an unpopular 3% sales tax. &quot;Seen from the standpoint of the fairness of the tax burden and our country's future outlook, the sales tax is indispensable,&quot; he said in his first policy speech to Parliament since taking power in August. The tax was the main cause of a crushing defeat for Mr. Kaifu last July, when his ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its upper-house majority.    UNILEVER BUYS BOURSIN    Unilever said it acquired the privately owned French cheese maker Boursin. The Anglo-Dutch food and health-products concern didn't say how much it paid for the acquisition. Boursin, whose brands include Boursin and Boursault, had sales of 30 million pounds ($48.6 million) and an after-tax profit of 3.4 million pounds in 1988. Boursin says it holds a 30% share of France's specialty-cheese market.    FRENCH TAKEOVER CODE    A new takeover code took effect in France. The new code's main provision requires anyone who buys more than one-third of a company to bid for at least two-thirds of the shares. That assures small holders of a chance to sell at a fair price if control of a company changes. Also under the new code, groups acting together are treated just like individual acquirers. That makes it hard for an investor to &quot;park&quot; shares with allies in order to avoid hitting the 33.3% threshold.    TOSHIBA'S JOINT VENTURE    Toshiba Denshi Device Inc., a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp., and Nippon Motorola, the Japan subsidiary of Illinois-based Motorola Inc. set up a new firm to sell the American company's computer chips in Japan. An official of the Japanese company said the new Nippon Motorola Micro Electronics will be owned equally by the two units. Access to the Japanese market by foreign semiconductor makers has been a contentious trade issue between Japan and the U.S.    LUFTHANSA'S TALKS    Lufthansa is holding talks with Austrian Airlines about acquiring a stake in the Austrian air carrier. Austrian Airlines said the West German national airline would buy up to 10% of Austrian Airlines in the course of a share offering planned for 1990; the Austrian government would reduce its stake in Austrian Airlines to 51% from the current 61%. All Nippon Airways holds 3.5% of Austrian Airlines. Swissair owns 8% and is planning to raise its interest to 10%, and Air France is also interested in raising its holding from the current 1.5%, according to Austrian Airlines.    SWEDISH TEST    A Swedish hospital said it would become the first in the world to begin testing a controversial French abortion pill as a contraceptive.    A spokesman of Stockholm's Karolinska Hospital said the pill, called Mifepristone or RU-486, would be tested on 30 women for six months to establish whether a single monthly dose could prevent pregnancy. The drug, made by Rousell Uclaf Co., is available in France and China, where it is used for non-surgical abortions.    Marc Bygdeman, head of the project, told Sweden's daily Dagens Nyheter that the drug appeared to force the womb to reject the egg, making a pregnancy impossible. &quot;We think that if the pill is taken around 24 hours after ovulation it can prevent pregnancy,&quot; he said.    Under French law, the drug can be used to induce an abortion up to about five weeks after fertilization has occurred. It has fewer side effects and is cheaper than surgery.    POSTSCRIPTS . . .    Land prices in Tokyo's residential areas have fallen for the first time since the National Land Agency began compiling local prices in 1975, but real-estate costs have been rising elsewhere in Japan, the agency said. . . . Cross-Purposes: The Voice of America's Portuguese-language broadcasts to Angola were disturbed last summer by signals from &quot;The Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel,&quot; a station experts say was set up by the CIA. </TEXT></DOC>
