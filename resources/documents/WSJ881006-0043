Roberts (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> DNB </CO><IN> PUB </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp.'s consumer marketing operations laid off about 178 employees, reflecting increasing rivalry and slowing growth in the business of distributing cents-off store coupons.    While the layoffs, which were effective Monday, are small in comparison to the size of the operations, they are Dun andamp; Bradstreet's first major move to protect its position in the coupon market.    The use of such coupons exploded during the 1980s as a promotional tool of packaged-goods marketers, who pay distributors to deliver their coupons. In turn, competition has become fierce among distributors who deliver the coupons for marketers through Sunday newspapers, in stores and by direct mail. Last year, industry revenue totaled $1.25 billion.    Dun andamp; Bradstreet's distribution operation, Donnelley Marketing, is one of the leading companies specializing in direct-mail distribution. Donnelley has been hurt in particular by increased competition from distributors who work through newspapers. Some 70% to 75% of coupons are delivered through newspapers.    In recent years, price-cutting by distributors has been rampant, sharply hurting industry profit margins, said John A. Cleary, Donnelley Marketing president.    In recent weeks, prices that distributors charge marketers have firmed, largely because of consolidation in the distribution business. Last month, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. acquired two of the three largest companies distributing through newspapers. But the price increases came too late to stave off Donnelley's cutbacks.    Most of the layoffs are at Donnelley, but Dun andamp; Bradstreet's Nielsen Marketing and Nielsen Media Research were also affected. Nielsen Marketing measures coupon usage and product purchases, among other things. Nielsen Media measures television ratings.    Meanwhile, packaged-goods marketers are beginning to back off from coupons because of &quot;clutter,&quot; industry people say. &quot;There are early signs that marketers have perceived a coupon glut and are questioning the efficacy of pouring out billions of them every year,&quot; said Joseph Laird, an investment banker active in the information industry.    For many years, the volume of coupons had been rising at 14% to 16% a year, Mr. Laird said, adding that it has cooled to 10% to 13%. The average household now receives about 2,300 coupons a year, noted Donnelley's Mr. Cleary. Rather than just flooding the market, he added, marketers are looking for more efficient ways to reach consumers who use coupons.    The Dun andamp; Bradstreet layoffs totaled 113 at Donnelley, or roughly 3% of that concern's total U.S. work force. The combined cuts at Nielsen were in the range of 65, or roughly 1% of its U.S. work force. In addition to the layoffs, Mr. Cleary said Donnelley is preparing new advertising and will attempt to reduce its reliance on package-good concerns by going after new types of customers such as financial-services concerns. Donnelley's share of the total coupon-distribution market is 5%.    Until 1986, Donnelley's sales had been rising, but they began to fall last year as Donnelley cut prices in response to cuts by concerns distributing through newspapers. Prices charged to marketers for delivering coupons fell to as low as $4 a thousand from about $6 several years ago.    Mr. Murdoch has moved swiftly to boost prices since buying Quad-Marketing Inc. and Product Movers Inc. The third major distributor, Valassis Inserts, is owned by Kerry Packer, an Australian magazine publisher. The price-per-thousand charged for delivering coupons has risen 25% to 40% in recent weeks, Mr. Cleary said. </TEXT></DOC>
