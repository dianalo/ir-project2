The British Broadcasting Corp. said the politicians met Oct.14-15 at the Angerhof Hotel between Duesseldorf and Duisburg andunanimously agreed they wanted to be partners in governing thetroubled British province.   It said the talks could produce the most important politicalbreakthrough since sectarian violence in the Protestant-dominatedprovince flared in August 1969. Meetings have continued in NorthernIreland since October, it said.   Catholic and Protestant party leaders who were not at the talksdivorced themselves from the report. John Hume, the province'sleading Catholic politician, called the BBC version ``nonsense.''   James Molyneaux of the Official Unionist Party and Ian Paisley ofthe hard-line Democratic Unionists, Northern Ireland's two mainProtestant leaders, also denied the report.   Peter Robinson, who the BBC said was a Protestant representative,had been Paisley's chief lieutenant but apparently has taken a moreindependent position recently.   Deputy leader Gordon Mawhinney of the Alliance Party, which getssupport from both religious communities, told The Associated Presshe participated in the talks.   The BBC said that in addition to Mawhinney and Robinson, theother two politicians who worked out the agreement in West Germanywere Jack Allen, chairman of the Official Unionists, the largestProtestant party; and Austin Currie of the moderate SocialDemocratic and Labor Party, the largest Catholic political group.   Mawhinny said the talks were arranged by a German Lutheran churchofficial for a different purpose, which he did not specify, but thefour politicians involved departed from the agenda ``somewhat byaccident'' and discussed their differences.   ``There was a regular line of communication opened between theNorthern Ireland political parties and ... great willingness to lookat the problems of the other community,'' he said.   The BBC said there never has been a Northern Ireland initiativeto solve the province's political problem and the fact that bothsides had continued the secret talks at home for four months showedwillingness to agree.   Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland said Wednesday nightbehind-the-scenes contacts had been going on. ``This is a delicateand sensitive area,'' he said. ``There is a fair amount of contacttaking place.'' Britain's Northern Ireland Office, the Cabinetdepartment in charge of the province, did not confirm knowledge ofthe talks, but said: ``If the reports of contact and talks betweenthe Northern Ireland parties are correct then the government wouldwelcome them.''   From its establishment 1921 until 1972, Northern Ireland had itsown parliament and government, including control of security forces.Britain handled only finance, defense and foreign affairs.   With terrorist activity increasing, Prime Minister Edward Heathdecided in 1972 to end self-government and impose direct rule. Thatwas followed by an agreement in 1974 to establish a Northern Irelandassembly of all parties.   That plan collapsed on the issue of power sharing and Protestantsopposed to joint rule with Catholics conducted several cripplingstrikes. Several unsuccessful attempts to revive the dialogue weremade in the past decade.   In its report Thursday, the BBC said the so-called DuisburgAgreement provides for a provincial government with power shared byall parties at all levels and control of the police.   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed IrishRepublican Army, was not included in the talks. The IRA is fightingto end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite it with the IrishRepublic, which is overwhelmingly Catholic.   More than 2,700 people have been killed in sectarian violence inNorthern Ireland since 1969.</TEXT></DOC>
