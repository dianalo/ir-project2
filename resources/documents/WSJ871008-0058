Rubin</HL><DD> 10/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMT </IN><TEXT>   Many Americans seem to believe that the world is becoming more dangerous, surveys find, at the same time that objective data show that risks are actually decreasing.    The nearby table illustrates some ways in which life is becoming less dangerous. Life expectancies are rising. Risks from major classes of accidents -- workplace deaths, home accident deaths and auto deaths per vehicle mile -- are falling.    One explanation for the apparent contradiction between belief and reality is that we are becoming better at identifying risks. This ability is useful, but it may lead to undue attention to unlikely events. Newly discovered risks get publicity because they are new. But such risks, while often worth addressing, tend to be minor. Significant risks, such as death from automobile accidents, do not need to be &quot;discovered.&quot; Common events, no matter how tragic, are not usually newsworthy; uncommon ones often are.    Focusing attention on small risks may create pressures for regulation not in the public interest. Several recent events involving the Consumer Product Safety Commission illustrate these points:    Cigarette lighters. Every week three people die in fires started by children playing with lighters. The press reports these deaths. But since they are relatively common, they often are relegated to the back of the paper or a few seconds on the air. On the other hand, deaths from exploding cigarette lighters are rare -- no more than one a year -- and when they happen they usually make the front pages.    The commission has been examining methods of reducing deaths from children playing with lighters. The technical staff is looking at the causes of these accidents and seeking possible remedies. If these researchers shifted their focus to the much smaller hazard of exploding lighters, fewer lives would be saved.    Pacifiers. Commission data indicate that the hazards of pacifiers are greatly exaggerated. These hazards have received a lot of publicity because of a March report by the Americans for Democratic Action's consumer-affairs committee. Most injuries associated with pacifiers occur when a child falls with a pacifier in his mouth; this is neither a product hazard nor an area for government regulation.    Nine of the 10 deaths in the past three years occurred when children were strangled by strings used to tie the pacifiers around their necks. Commission regulations prohibit the sale of pacifiers with strings and require a label warning against this practice. Any further effort to reduce the hazards associated with pacifiers would divert attention and resources from greater dangers, and the warnings probably would cause needless worry.    Bunk Beds. Another example of a widely reported &quot;hazard&quot; is the danger from bunk beds, a product that is actually quite safe. The commission has been petitioned by the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer-activist group, to require stronger standards for bunk beds.    Between 1973 and 1986 there have been only 22 known entrapment deaths involving bunk beds and, while each death is tragic, this is a small number compared with deaths associated with many other products. Many of the deaths involved children too young to have been safely placed in any bed at all or who were put in the upper bunk, contrary to warnings.    Moreover death by entrapment is not a bunk-bed hazard; it is a bed hazard. The commission is aware of 212 deaths from bed entrapment between 1973 and 1986. Bunk beds, involved in 10% of all such entrapment deaths, constitute about 10% of all beds. They are therefore no more dangerous than other beds, and there is no justification for more stringent regulation, nor is there any reason to view them as especially hazardous.    The risks associated with cigarette lighters, pacifiers and bunk beds have been exaggerated. But there are those with an interest in such exaggeration. &quot;Public interest&quot; organizations depend on voluntary contributions for their existence and must convince their constituencies that there are risks that the government isn't regulating adequately. The staffs of regulatory agencies benefit from increased funding brought about by public worry about risks under their jurisdiction; staffers therefore may have an incentive to treat these small risks as being more serious than is appropriate. The media can also be to blame for hyping stories about freak accidents, giving the misleading impression that they are commonplace.    The interaction of these groups can lead to several effects. First is excessive and inappropriate regulation. Terence Scanlon, chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, has attempted to direct his agency toward more substantive matters. However, a bill introduced in the House last month contains terms that would remove him from office and would require the agency to address several relatively minor issues such as lawn darts, a game that has been involved in only three fatalities in the past 13 years. The bill also addresses cigarette lighters but does not distinguish between the serious problem of child-caused accidents and the much less serious one of explosions.    The second effect is needless fear on the part of the public. Finally, if all risks are treated the same, people may respond either by ignoring all warnings or by making efforts to avoid trivial risks while inadvertently accepting much larger ones.    ---   Mr. Rubin, formerly chief economist of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, is an economic consultant in Washington.    ---           Life Expectancy and Accidental Deaths                         1930     1960     1980     1984-5  Life expectancy   at birth              59.7     69.7     73.7     74.4  Work accident deaths*  14.7      7.7      5.8      4.8  Motor vehicle deaths** 15.6      5.3      3.5      2.6  Home accident deaths*  24.0     15.6     10.0      8.6   *Per 100,000 population   **Per 100 million vehicle miles   Sources: Statistical Abstract; Accident Facts</TEXT></DOC>
