Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed ServicesServices Committee. ``Well, the War Powers Act is broken and itshould be fixed.''   The Vietnam-era law, enacted over the veto of President Nixon,restricts the power of a president to send U.S. military personnelto situations of ``imminent hostilities.''   The current law requires a report from the president when suchtroops are dispatched. Under some circumstances, those troops mustbe withdrawn after 60 days or 90 days, unless Congress specificallyvotes to authorize them to remain.   The new proposal would allow the troops to remain for anunspecified length of time unless Congress votes to remove them.   In addition, the proposal creates a group of 18 seniorcongressional leaders who would regularly meet with the presidentto discuss national security matters.   In situations of hostilities, the group of congressional leaderscould trigger the war powers law by introducing a resolution toeither authorize the troops to remain or to order them withdrawn.   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the regular consultationsbetween the congressional leaders and a president ``will forge astronger basis for bipartisan cooperation in national securitymatters.   ``Meaningful and consistant consultation with the Congress wouldalso help prevent the president from implementing a controversialpolicy that Congress could not responsibly change,'' said Mitchell.   All four presidents since the enactment of the war powers lawhave contended that it is an unconstitutional restriction on theirauthority.   ``The War Powers Act, as presently constituted, is unworkable,''said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a co-sponsor ofthe proposed change.   ``Frankly, if I were president, I would thumb my nose at thislegislation,'' said Byrd, speaking of the existing law. ``Nopresident can indicate to a potential enemy'' plans such as thelength of a proposed deployment of troops, he said.   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the ArmedServices Committee, said he supports the change because theexisting law ``has never worked very well.''   ``Every president resents a diminution of his power,'' saidWarner, explaining why the law has always been a focus oflegislative-executive fights.   Byrd and Warner said the Reagan administration had not beenconsulted in advance about the proposed change in the law.   ``I would hope the administration won't veto this,'' said Byrd.He said hearings will be held later by the Foreign RelationsCommittee.   Warner said, ``It will be up to the administration to look atthis and see if they can support it.''   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign RelationsCommittee, agreed that ``the present law does not seem to beworking.''   The latest fight over the War Powers Act involves Reagan'sPersian Gulf policy of reflagging 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers andprotecting them with Navy warships.   Reagan has refused to invoke the law, even though there havebeen four separate clashes between the Navy and Iran. Congress hasdebated trying to invoke the law, but has been unable to agree onwhether that should be done.</TEXT></DOC>
