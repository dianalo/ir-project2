The rebel New People's Army Central Luzon command made thewarning in a statement released to news agencies.   Also Saturday, a newspaper reported that guerrillas had trailednine U.S. servicemen, apparently in preparation for an assassinationattempt.   The rebels' policy ``of punishing American troops deployed inU.S. military installations in the country'' is still in force, theguerrilla statement said. It said about 1,000 Filipino soldiersproviding additional security around Clark Air Base also are targets.   The Filipino troops were assigned to the U.S. base last yearfollowing reports that guerrillas had trailed the nine U.S.servicemen.   The Pacific Stars and Stripes, an unofficial U.S. militarynewspaper, quoted authorities as saying they learned of thesurveillance through documents seized in July from the New People'sArmy.   The newspaper quoted police Maj. Efren Alamares as saying thenine _ two U.S. Air Force colonels, a lieutenant colonel, fourcaptains, and two sergeants _ were apparently targeted because theylived off base.   The U.S. military command at Clark refused comment on the rebelstatement. Capt. Donna Eggelston, a Clark spokeswoman, said the U.S.Air Force ``periodically receives intelligence reports on terroristactivity'' but does not comment on their content.   Communist guerrillas have attacked Americans in the past.   In April, guerrillas killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe ashe drove to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group inQuezon City.   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipinocivilian in coordinated ambushes outside Clark.   The rebels have repeatedly threatened to attack U.S. personnelbecause of Washington's support for President Corazon Aquino'scampaign to crush the guerrillas' 20-year insurgency.   Some 40,000 American troops, civilians and military dependentsare stationed at six U.S. military installations in the Philippines.More than half are stationed at Clark in central Luzon, the mainPhilippine island.</TEXT></DOC>
