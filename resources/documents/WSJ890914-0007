Worst hit were the high-yield, high-risk bonds of two big Campeau units, Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc. Yesterday, some of the Allied securities plummeted as many as 10 points, or $100 for each $1,000 face amount, and their yield climbed to an astonishing 30%. Since the bonds were issued, their prices have declined as many as 45 points.    The junk issues of other retailers fell sharply, and many investors flocked to the safety of short-term Treasury bills. Trading in junk bonds slowed as investors retreated to the sidelines. And rumors flashed through Wall Street about supposed big losses on the trading desks of some brokerage firms. In a moment of panic, traders thought that even market makers, such as Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., had pulled out of the junk market entirely.    &quot;Any bond tainted with a credit question has been hit by the market,&quot; said Kingman Penniman, senior vice president with McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc. &quot;The market is trying to identify the time bombs,&quot; Mr. Penniman said.    Campeau, the big Canadian real-estate concern, has struggled to refinance some loans. Yesterday, public filings by Campeau disclosed it has run into a more serious cash shortage than had been believed. In particular, Campeau said its Allied unit could miss two interest payments due tomorrow on its bonds.    Among Wall Street securities firms, the biggest casualty of the Campeau debacle is CS First Boston Group's First Boston Corp., according to people familiar with the situation.    First Boston, which was the underwriter of more than $1 billion of securities issued by Campeau companies, owns hundreds of millions of dollars of these securities, traders familiar with the firm's position said.    First Boston declined to comment.    As rumors whirled through the market, Merrill Lynch, also rumored to have sustained losses on securities issued by Campeau or its units, issued public denials. &quot;We have no junk-bond loss. Our junk-bond desk is profitable,&quot; said a Merrill spokesman.    In the broader junk market, Campeau's troubles broadsided bonds issued by other retailers. Traders said Macy's junk issues declined in price by one to two points. Ann Taylor bonds also fell.    James Spirrison, a senior vice president at Rodman andamp; Renshaw in Chicago, said the fallout from Campeau &quot;has spread itself over marginal-type junk issues. Most everything I've seen is down. It isn't pretty.&quot;    &quot;It's the worst market I've seen since the crash,&quot; said a high-yield trader in New York said. &quot;There is a huge calendar {of expected new issues} that is putting a negative tone on it,&quot; he said. One fear, the trader added, is that high-yield mutual funds will be hit by customer redemptions and will be forced to sell some of their holdings.    Even bonds of quality issuers, such as RJR Nabisco Inc., were off, although generally not by as much as distressed issues.    &quot;It's an extension of a pattern of trading we've seen over the last several months,&quot; said Robert M. Spurck, director of high-yield research at Shearson Lehman Hutton. &quot;There has been a real flight to quality&quot; junk, he said.    Some investors flocked yesterday to Treasury bills, considered the safest and most liquid investment. While prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell about 3/8 point, prices of short-term bills rose, and yields fell. For example, yields on three-month Treasury bills dropped to 7.50% from 7.59% late Tuesday.    Shearson's Mr. Spurck said some good junk credits may be a tad overpriced due to investor nervousness. &quot;You have a number of credits that are trading too low. Paper that shouldn't trade down does -- it's guilt by association. We're buyers in that market,&quot; he said.    Junk bond traders spent much of the afternoon chasing rumors that competitors' desks, including First Boston, had stopped putting up bids for junk bonds.    Raymond Minella, co-head of Merrill's merchant-banking department, which includes its high-yield junk bond division, said near the close of trading that, on balance, Merrill had a bigger selling, than buying, position in Campeau issues. &quot;Our merchant banking group, including our junk bond group, has been quite profitable this year,&quot; Mr. Minella said. People familiar with Merrill's operations said its merchant-banking group has earned well over $150 million this year. The rumors about Merrill seemed to gain strength from the apparent misinterpretation of the resignation of a Merrill junk bond trader two weeks ago. A Merrill spokesman confirmed the resignation, but said it was unrelated to any rumors about Campeau-related losses. The trader had exceeded internal Merrill trading limits on Resorts International Inc. bonds totaling slightly less than $10 million, said people familiar with the situation.    Holders of Allied and Federated bonds are closely watching continuing negotiations by Campeau to secure loans and sell assets to meet debt payments. Some of the Federated issues have covenants that allow investors to redeem them at full face value if control of the company is changed -- a possibility, now.    But Robert Lupo, Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. managing director, said he doubts that Campeau's banks would allow this so-called poison put to take effect. That's because banks have a stake in Federated's senior debt, which they would try to protect ahead of any redemption by junk bond holders.    &quot;The fate of the subordinated debt holders is in the hands of the senior debt holders -- the banks and Campeau,&quot; said Mr. Lupo.    Municipals    Market participants are awaiting the pricing of the bonds for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.    At 11 a.m. EDT Thursday, there will be bidding for $100 million of consolidated bonds, 65th Series, and $100 million of consolidated bonds 66th series.    Treasury Securities    Long-term Treasury bonds fell on rumors of a coordinated rate hike by the Bank of Japan and West Germany's Bundesbank, but short-term maturities gained, resulting in a steeper yield curve. The 30-year Treasury bond fell about 3/8 of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. Short- and intermediate-term Treasury notes rose about 1/8 of a point. Yields on some Treasury bills declined by as much as .08 of one percent.    Traders said a chart-related sell-off in T-bond futures amplified the broader unloading of long-term Treasury bonds. Demand for the short-term securities was related to a rush to &quot;safe&quot; investments after Citicorp chairman John Reed announced he doesn't expect Brazil and Venezuela to make interest payments on their debt before the end of this quarter. Additionally, dealers expect large re-investment in short- and medium-term Treasurys when a large yen bond issue matures next week. Also, traders said the big sell-off in the junk-bond market caused a rush to short-term Treasurys.    Corporate Issues    Elsewhere in the corporate market, issues closed 1/8 to 1/4 point lower, or $1.25 to $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    General Electric Capital Corp. kicked off a heavy session of new-issue activity with a $250 million offering of 20-year notes.    A group led by Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. won the securities that are priced to yield 8.386%. The winning bid was for an 8.30% coupon, which resulted in net interest cost to the company of 8.411%.    The issue, offered by the General Electric Co. unit, is noncallable and is puttable back to the company in nine years.    Syndicate officials said the issue saw good investor demand and was sold out in a matter of hours.    So far this year, GE Capital has issued about $3.3 billion in debt, excluding commercial paper, said a company official.    Meanwhile, Bank of New England Corp. increased its offering of 10-year subordinated notes to $250 million from an orginally planned $200 million.    The noncallable subordinated notes were priced to yield 9.886%, which represents a yield spread of 1.75% points above the Treasury's 10-year note.    Rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and triple-B-plus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Mortgage-Backed Securities    Aided by demand associated with a spate of new derivative mortgage offerings and concerns about the quality of corporate bonds, mortgage securities continued to fare better than comparable-maturity Treasury issues.    Active Government National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issues fell 4/32 to 6/32 but held up better than intermediate Treasurys, which were off as much as 1/4 point.    There were three real estate mortgage investment conduit issues totaling $1.1 billion announced yesterday. This represents a pickup from the slack volume during the past two weeks.    Ginnie Mae 9% securities for September delivery ended at 97 19/32, down 5/32; and Freddie Mac 9% securities ended at 96 21/32, off 6/32.    Foreign Bonds    French Treasurys ended sharply lower as a number of negative factors unleashed widespread selling, knocking prices down in their biggest loss since mid-August.    Dealers noted a wave of switching out of the French market and into the West German market as the spread between the two markets' 10-year bonds approached 1.50%, considered by many a significant resistance point. By the end of the day, the spread had widened to 1.63%.    One analyst, noting expectations that West Germany's Bundesbank will have to raise interest rates later this year to cool booming economic growth, said: &quot;It finally dawned on the markets that European interest rates are going higher this fall.&quot;    In addition, she suggested that the liberalization on Oct. 1 of regulations on French mutual funds is probably &quot;prompting a lot of reshuffling by those funds ahead of that date.&quot;    Coupled with a general unease before the release of a number of significant U.S. indicators later this week, all those elements came together Wednesday, she said, and a lot of stock moved.    Among French Treasurys, or Obligations Assimilables du Tresor, the 8 1/8% issues of 1999 ended down 0.52 from late Tuesday in Paris at 97.06 to yield 8.57%, while, at the long end, the 8.5% issues of 2019 fell 0.82 at 97.16 to yield 8.76%.    On the MATIF futures exchange in Paris, the December bond-futures contract closed at 108.46, down 0.26 from late Tuesday.    Elsewhere:    --Deutsche mark bond prices slipped slightly, but trading in both the cash government bond and Euro sectors was thin and primarily limited to professionals.    &quot;No one wants to take on more paper,&quot; said one Frankfurt Deutsche mark bond trader. &quot;Customers left the market a long time ago,&quot; the trader said.    Bonn's 6 3/4% bonds due June 1999 ended down 0.10 point at 98.70 to yield 6.94%. The 6 3/4% notes of 1994 dropped 0.075 point to 98.675 to yield 7.08%.    In London, the December Bund future closed at 93.71, down 0.07 point from Tuesday's finish. The December three-month Euro-DM interest rate contract dropped 0.07 point to 92.55.    --Among Eurobonds, the benchmark World Bank 6 3/4% of 1999 were quoted at 97.30 bid to yield 7.14%.    --British Gilts finished lower. Among the benchmarks, the treasury 11 3/4% 2003/2007 fell about 3/32 to 113 19/32 to yield 9.88%, while the treasury 11 3/4% of 1991 ended 2/32 lower at 99 13/32 to yield 12.17%.    --In Japan, repurchases of positions sold &quot;short&quot; earlier, continued to bolster the government-bond market. The benchmark bond ended on brokers' screens at its high price of 95.83, up 0.20. In a short sale, borrowed securities are sold with the intent of buying them back later at a cheaper price.    ---   Roger Lowenstein, Matthew Winkler and William Power contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
