How he will cope remains a mystery.   Fujimori's team of advisers has been wracked by dissension anddefections. Only days before the inauguration, Fujimori wasscrambling to put together both a government and a plan with whichto govern.   Fujimori's ``good intention of selecting the best from eachparty may end in disaster, because the best may not want to join agovernment without well-defined aims,'' the magazine Caretas said.   Fujimori's government will face immense problems.   Inflation tops 3,000 percent a year. Four of five people lacksteady work. The Central Bank has no dollars and has sold almostall its gold. Bread is rationed. Provincial gas stations are dry.   Guerrilla violence is at an all-time high. Maoist Shining Pathrebels control much of Peru's Andean mountains and Amazonianjungle. The pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement recentlystaged a spectacular breakout from Lima's maximum-security prison.   The worst drought to hit Peru this century has devastated cropsand drastically cut Lima's water supply. Hydroelectric plants runat half capacity. The daily blackouts have paralyzed industry.   A U.S.-backed plan to fight the trade in coca leaves, the rawmaterial of cocaine, threatens to deprive Peru of its top export.The country earns $1 billion a year from the coca trade, whichdirectly employs about 200,000 people in this country of 2 million.   To reverse this economic collapse, Fujimori has proposed drasticmeasures. He says they will include a major devaluation of Peru'sinti, the end of price subsidies, privatization of many statecompanies, and emergency taxes on the rich.   Soon after his June 10 landslide victory over novelist MarioVargas Llosa, Fujimori traveled to the United States and Japanseeking economic aid.   In New York, he met with the heads of the International MonetaryFund and the World Bank. Outgoing President Alan Garcia cut tieswith these organizations four years ago. Fujimori hopes to receiveloans in return for implementing an IMF-approved austerity plan.   But Fujimori's plan has met with strong domestic opposition.This is due largely to Fujimori's own condemnation of such a``shock'' program during his campaign against Vargas Llosa.   Within Fujimori's Change 90 party, one camp favors a drasticeconomic ``shock'' and another favors a more gradual approach. Manybelieve this conflict has resulted in chaos.   The party's ``organizational structure has disintegrated,''economist Daniel Schydlowsky said. A professor at BostonUniversity, Schydlowsky resigned last week along with two other topFujimori advisers.   ``There's no time to put together a program and no team to doso,'' Schydlowsky told the Lima daily La Republica.   When Fujimori finally named 11 of his 14 ministers last week,none belonged to Change 90. Most were independents, with asprinkling of people from Peru's strong left- and right-wingparties.   ``What awaits us is an intermediate, zig-zagging path,'' saidManuel D'Ornellas, a political commentator, after Fujimori namedhis Cabinet. ``It will be neither shock nor gradualism.''   An unprecedented three ministries _ Defense, Interior andFisheries _ went to military officers. Most analysts view this as asign of Fujimori's weakness.   Fujimori's opponents showed little inclination to help thepresident-elect form what he had wanted to be a ``concensus''Cabinet.   The center-right Popular Action party forced Juan Carlos HurtadoMiller to resign his membership when he became Fujimori's primeminister and economy minister. The Marxist United Left coalitionattacked member Gloria Helfer for becoming education minister.   With the support of neither the left nor right, Fujimori willhave a hard time imposing his plan. Change 90 holds fewercongressional seats than either Vargas Llosa's Democratic Frontcoalition or Garcia's Aprista Party.   Peru has a strong presidency, and Fujimori will be able togovern partly by decree. But many of his plans will requirecongressional support, which means he will have to form some sortof alliance.   But Fernando Belaunde Terry, twice Peru's president and de factoleader of the center-right congressional faction, says his groupwas elected to the opposition.   And on the left, Garcia has made clear he will stick to hispopulist positions rather than help a Fujimori government imposeausterity measures.   ``One may have grave problems managing the economy, but thisdoesn't mean one should yield to the right or to imperialism. Whatis important is to stand firm with the poor,'' Garcia said. ``I amsure these adjustments will not take place.''</TEXT></DOC>
