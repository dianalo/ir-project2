Although fire-safety experts agree that sprinklers are the best way to prevent tragic blazes in tall buildings, the Dupont Plaza didn't have them. Nor do the vast majority of tall buildings in the U.S.    Furthermore, a widely used fire-safety standard published by the National Fire Prevention Association, a Boston-based group, doesn't require sprinklers in old or new buildings. The NFPA is currently revising its model code, and the sprinkler issue is high on its agenda. About half the states and dozens of cities base their fire-prevention laws on the NFPA model.    In many cities and states, sprinkler systems are required only in new buildings, while a handful of cities and one state, Massachusetts, have adopted laws recently requiring that all high-rises have sprinkler systems within the next five to 10 years. Some cities, such as Washington, D.C., don't require them at all -- even on new buildings -- although Washington is considering changing that.    Opponents of mandatory sprinklers argue that they are too expensive -- especially in old buildings -- and that other fire protection methods are sufficient.    The NFPA points out, however, that no U.S. fire in buildings fully equipped with properly working sprinklers has resulted in more than two fatalities, excepting explosions and firefighter deaths.    &quot;I'm sure sprinklers could have made a difference&quot; in San Juan, says Robert Barnes, a manager with Gage Babcock andamp; Associates Inc., a Chicago-based fire-prevention consulting firm.    Ron Cote, an NFPA engineer, says, to many building owners &quot;the priority is on what looks nice and makes a building rentable. People will spend as much money putting down carpets in a building as a sprinkler system would cost. Few people ask, 'Does your building have sprinklers,' when they are thinking of moving in.&quot;    Sprinklers are particularly important in high-rise buildings -- generally those with more than six stories -- because fire departments' extension ladders usually can't reach higher than about 75 feet. &quot;It is very hard to haul hose lines up 60 flights of stairs,&quot; Mr. Barnes says.    Fire-safety officials want placement of sprinklers in new high-rise buildings to become standard practice and are pushing for a new rule in the NFPA's influential code. In the past, such measures have faced strong opposition from groups that have a say in drafting the NFPA code. &quot;Developers squirm when you suggest things that increase costs,&quot; says Robert B. Smith, executive secretary of the Fire Marshals Association of North America in Washington, D.C. Fire-safety experts, though, expect sprinklers eventually to be required in all new U.S. high-rises.    The next step -- requiring building owners to retrofit old buildings with sprinklers -- is far more controversial. Only 10% to 15% of nonresidential buildings in the U.S. have sprinkler systems, estimates the National Fire Sprinkler Association, a trade group. Retrofitting buildings with sprinklers usually costs $2 to $3 a square foot -- too much to make them practical, building owners argue.    Still, retrofitting seems to be an idea whose time may be coming. Last month, Massachusetts enacted a law requiring all buildings higher than 70 feet to be equipped with sprinklers within nine years. The new law was inspired by a fire last January at Boston's 52-story Prudential Center, which didn't have sprinklers, in which 24 people were injured. Florida requires sprinklers in some existing high-rises. And following the MGM Grand Hotel fire in Las Vegas that killed 84 people in 1980, all high-rise owners in Las Vegas were required to install sprinklers.    Sprinklers can be crucial in old buildings packed with highly flammable wood and plaster. But even modern buildings can become deadly firetraps with astonishing speed; many plastics burn faster than wood and give off poisonous gases that account for 75% or more of fire fatalities. Some of the victims of the San Juan fire reportedly were found dead in their chairs, apparently overcome almost instantly.    Of course, sprinklers don't always work. &quot;And let's face it, we will lose people if a major bomb is set off in a building even if it has sprinklers,&quot; says Russell Fleming, an official with the fire sprinkler association. But many arson-caused fires -- and officials in San Juan have said they suspect arson in the Dupont Plaza fire -- could be slowed or stopped with sprinklers, say fire experts. </TEXT></DOC>
