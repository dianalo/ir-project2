William H. Gray III, in an uncomfortablespotlight after a Memorial Day visit from FBI agents, wrote anangry letter Wednesday to the Justice Department demanding a probeof news leaks.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh assured the fourth-rankingHouse Democrat that he had ordered ``a full investigation'' intoleaks saying the FBI had begun a preliminary probe into allegationsthat Gray may have had a ghost employee on his payroll.   Jon Plebani, Gray's staff director, said Wednesday, ``Everyemployee who works for Bill Gray comes to work and does work. He'sa very demanding boss.''   Gray is seeking the post of majority whip being vacated by Rep.Tony Coelho, D-Calif. In his letter to Thornburgh, Gray questionedwhy the department waited ``until the eve of Democratic leadershipchanges to inform me or ask my cooperation.''   Rep. David E. Bonior, D-Mich., one of Gray's opponents in thewhip's race, also complained, ``The American people are fed up withthe effort to use innuendoes and rumors to discredit our publicofficials. We must stop this destructive politics of characterassassination.''   Government sources told several news organizations Tuesday thatGray had been visited by FBI agents who were conducting apreliminary inquiry. Gray denied that he had done anything wrongand suggested in an evening news conference Tuesday that theallegations were politically motivated.   ``I was told over and over again I was not the subject of aninvestigation,'' Gray said. He said he'd been told that the bureauwas ``looking into allegations about an employee or employees.''   Gray wrote a sharply worded letter to Thornburgh demanding anindependent investigation of the source of any leak. Thornburghresponded, ``Prior to receiving your letter, I had ordered a fullinvestigation of the apparent unauthorized disclosure ofinformation in this matter.''   The purpose of the investigation, Thornburgh said, ``is touncover any possible wrongdoing within the department or elsewhereand to prevent such leaks in the future.''   In Philadelphia, FBI spokesman John Kundts said Wednesday thatthe bureau would not ``confirm nor deny that there is aninvestigation under way.''   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel disputed suggestionsthat top department officials leaked information for politicalreasons.   ``If that is going on, it's going on at a lower level of thedepartment,'' Runkel said.   The spokesman described Thornburgh as ``disturbed by leaks thathave come out of the department concerning matters which have ledto news stories on members of Congress.''   ``If there is some attempted interference here in the actions ofthe House Democratic Caucus it is of concern to us,'' Runkel said.   Last Thursday, the attorney general asked Assistant AttorneyGeneral Edward S.G. Dennis ``to look into the unauthorizeddisclosure of information'' leading to stories that Coehlo and LosAngeles Mayor Tom Bradley were being investigated by the FBI.   The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the FBI wasconducting a preliminary inquiry into investments that Coelho andBradley made through the investment firm of Drexel, Burnham andLambert.</TEXT></DOC>
