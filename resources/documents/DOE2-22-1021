Cells of certain tumors have an abnormal chromosomal composition,in some instances a specific one. Many of the metabolic disorders arehereditary; and even in the case of some drug reactions, the problemlies not only with the drug but also with the patient, who has inheritedan enzymatic defect that prevents normal detoxification. Future geneticinvestigation promises to increase our understanding of the causes andthe mechanisms of individual responses to disease.</TEXT></DOC>
