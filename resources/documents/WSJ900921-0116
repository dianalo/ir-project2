Its headquarters is a 300-acre campus in the horsecountry west of Philadelphia.   Yet the lush, country-club atmosphere is deceiving, forany significant event anywhere in the world reverberatesthrough company corridors.</LP><TEXT>   A massacre in Beijing? Arco's shipments into China arestopped. Communism falls in Eastern Europe? Arco faces toughdecisions about joint ventures, as well as the threat ofstronger competitors from Germany.   Moreover, events don't have to be earthshaking to sendtremors through headquarters. You name the world economictrend and somehow it affects Arco -- from stronger Japanesecompetition, to rising or falling interest rates, to Koreangovernment policy on financing joint ventures, to concernover the environment.   Although Arco risks being buffeted by world political andeconomic events, the coin has a flip side. The company hasshed its less successful product lines, and around the worldit can now take advantage of its technological edge withinits narrow niche. That's what defines Arco's strategy. Andit's a strategy being followed by many companies that werebroad-based in the 1960s and 1970s and then fell on hardtimes.   It's also a strategy that has paid off: Arco Chemicalrakes in more than one-third of its $2.7 billion in salesfrom abroad, and makes about half of its new investmentoutside of the U.S.   For a long time, Arco Chemical was the victim of trying tobe all things to all people. It had overexpanded two decadesago and when sales failed to grow, it suffered heavy losses.&quot;Overcapacity was the story of this company in the 1970s,&quot;says Harold Sorgenti, president and chief executive.   In the 1980s, the company stripped itself down to its mostcompetitive lines of business. That meant mostly intermediatechemicals used in making such things as cushions and bedding.It also included chemicals used in automotive resins and fueladditives. At one point, revenue shrank from $3.5 billionannually to $1.5 billion. But now it claims half the globalmarket for the products it makes. In 1987, Atlantic RichfieldCo. sold part of Arco Chemical in a public offering, but thegiant energy company still owns more than 80% of the chemicalmaker's stock. Lodwrick M. Cook, Atlantic Richfield'schairman and chief executive, is also Arco Chemical'schairman.   Arco Chemical went global partly because it was forced to.The company's engineering resins, under the Dylark trademark,are sold to the auto industry. In the past, that meantselling exclusively to Detroit's Big Three in the U.S.market. No longer.   &quot;Today we deal with Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Renault,Peugeot and Volkswagen,&quot; says Jack E. Oppasser, vicepresident for world-wide business management. &quot;We're dealingwith Nissan and Toyota in Japan and in the U.S. We're dealingwith Ford and General Motors in the U.S. and in Europe.&quot; Arcohas to be able to deliver a product anywhere in the world,Mr. Oppasser says, or else lose the business.   Global operations have also meant, however, that Arcofaces increasingly stiff competition from abroad, in additionto its traditional U.S. competitors such as Dow Chemical.   European companies have been expanding operations inAmerica. Among them are German concerns such as Bayer andBASF, French companies such as Rhone Poulenc, and Britishgiant ICI, which has made numerous U.S. acquisitions inrecent years.   Japanese competitors are also beginning to attack Arco'sbusiness lines -- in propylene glycol and polyols,intermediate chemicals used to make foam for seat cushionsand many other products. For example, Asahi Glass has begun afierce price-cutting campaign in both Asia and Europe onproducts in which Arco is strong. In return, Arco hascounterattacked by trying to steal one of Asahi's biggestcustomers in Japan.   Arco executives say the battle against Asahi Glass isgreatly aided by having a joint-venture partner, in this caseSumitomo Chemical. Sumitomo has been a source of competitiveintelligence, and its knowledge of the Japanese market hasbeen instrumental in launching the counterattack.   &quot;The Japanese can sometimes be difficult and sometimesvery, very cooperative,&quot; says Mr. Oppasser. &quot;Our partner inJapan, Sumitomo Chemical, has been a very good partner.&quot;   Joint ventures are an inescapable -- if not always welcome-- part of the global business landscape these days. Mostlarge companies would prefer to go it alone overseas, butthat isn't practical for many of them. Alliances or jointventures offer the fastest, cheapest and least risky way togo world-wide quickly.   Arco's joint ventures have provided the company entreeinto difficult overseas markets, especially in Asia. Theprice has been a certain lack of control over the plant'sproduction, among other things.   But for Arco a more formidable challenge comes frompolitical events. They are often unforeseen, yet they canquickly change the business landscape for an entire region,making this month's sales targets obsolete. More ominously,they can make this year's capital-spending plans uneconomicalovernight.   Consider the huge question mark posed by China. Lastyear's political upheaval and crackdown, climaxed by theBeijing government's massacre of demonstrators in TiananmenSquare, had immediate repercussions for the company.   The crisis in China interrupted shipments of styrene, oneof the company's major products. Styrene is used in a varietyof consumer products, including insulated cups, foodcontainers and building insulation. The inability of Westerncompanies to get supplies into China caused a glut in themarket and a world-wide drop in prices. Partly as a result,Arco's 1989 earnings fell from year-earlier levels, to $405million from $494 million. Revenue declined slightly, to$2.66 billion from $2.7 billion.   The styrene market has since rebounded, but China's futureas a market for Arco products is still a puzzle. Politicalstability is only one concern. At least as important isChina's primitive transportation network, which makes itdifficult for Arco to distribute its products.   &quot;It's the world's largest market. The standard of livingis increasing. You have to be interested&quot; in China, says Mr.Sorgenti, the Arco president. &quot;The question is the timing ofour investments and size of investments.&quot;   In Eastern Europe, the challenge facing Arco is to seizean opportunity, although one that may develop only slowly. &quot;Idon't think things are going to happen quite as fast aspeople believe,&quot; says Mr. Sorgenti. &quot;Nonetheless, we feelstrongly that we ought to be positioning ourselves for whatis going to be a market equal in size to the U.S. We haveover 350 million people who have been thrust on the market.I'm including Eastern Europe and Russia.&quot;   Says Marvin Schlanger, chief financial officer: &quot;InWestern Europe, we're comfortable talking about a singlemarket. In Eastern Europe, each country is a uniquesituation.&quot; In an effort to develop business, Arco has beguntalking with several possible partners about joint ventures,most notably in Hungary but also in Czechoslovakia. For thetime being, Arco is using its Western European outpost as aspringboard for exports into Eastern Europe. Arco hopes thattoday's trickle of sales will increase substantially by theend of 1990.   The biggest decision concerns the location of Arco's nextplant. It is scheduled to be a propylene oxide facility thatwould cost perhaps $500 million and would producecommodity-type chemicals that could be sold in largequantities, prior to being refined into end products. &quot;Thechoice is between Europe and Southeast Asia. It's a tossup,&quot;says Mr. Oppasser, the Arco vice president. &quot;We'll make thatdecision within a year.&quot; The uncertain growth potential ofEastern Europe is the biggest wild card here.   Many U.S. companies in a number of industries are facingthe same types of tough investment decisions these days.Among the factors are these: the potential growth in eachmarket, the political stability of the country, theavailability and cost of energy, the cost of raw materials,the cost of construction, the supply of technical personnel,and the tax benefits offered by the host country.   Faddishness may also play a part, and it is somethingexecutives try to factor out of their thinking. &quot;The current`in' mode of thinking is Eastern Europe over Southeast Asia,&quot;says Mr. Oppasser. &quot;One or two years ago it was SoutheastAsia. Southeast Asia is still growing and very desirable.&quot;   Before any decision is made, Arco executives in therespective regions -- Arco Chemical Europe and Arco ChemicalAsia-Pacific -- will each submit reports arguing why theirregion should get the next plant. This will be supplementedby analysis at headquarters, including reports by outsideconsultants.   The tensions and the competition between regions areconsidered natural. Mr. Oppasser heads a group of 11 people,formed two years ago, to augment the regional viewpoints witha global view from headquarters.   The company, for instance, had planned to ship propyleneglycol for the Asia Pacific region out of a plant inRotterdam but last year decided it would be cheaper toproduce the chemicals in the U.S. instead.   &quot;It affected profitability of the European operation by alittle over $1 million, but the overall impact on ArcoChemical was a positive $3.3 million,&quot; Mr. Oppasser says.&quot;Europe wasn't necessarily happy. But it was the rightdecision.&quot;   Arco executives also see the opportunity to make moneyfrom the growing concern over the environment, especially inthe U.S.   The company is a leading producer of a high-octanegasoline additive whose growth is being driven by increasingdemand for unleaded fuels. As the Clean Air Act is put intoeffect, Arco expects surging demand for the product, calledmethyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE.   Arco plans to divert some of its European production ofMTBE to the East Coast. That will ease pressure on a largeplant in Houston, which will focus on producing largely forthe Western part of the U.S. market. Eventually, ArcoChemical executives say, demand should increase in Europe,too. But as in the past, the U.S. tends to lead Europe (andAsia) by several years in adopting stricter environmentalcontrols.   The larger question, though, is whether a medium-sizedniche player such as Arco Chemical can compete in a fielddominated by giants. It is a question that will be faced bymany companies all over the globe, as restructuring ofindustry takes place in the next few years.   &quot;Can the medium-sized {company} survive? If you don't havesomething special to contribute, the answer is no,&quot; says Mr.Sorgenti, Arco's president. &quot;We have 50% of the world marketin the products where we compete. That says we're going to becompetitive.&quot;   But Mr. Sorgenti quickly adds, &quot;It doesn't say we won'thave competition. The danger is, when you're competingnarrowly against a giant, if he wants to, he can trample us.&quot;   ---   Mr. Wysocki, a Wall Street Journal news editor, served ascontributing editor of this Wall Street Journal Report.   ---                   International Expansion                                                                                                          Arco Chemical's percentage of employees and sales byregion                                                                                                                                Employees*                       Total -- 3,361                                                                                                          Americas ...................................... 69.7%   Europe ........................................ 22.8%   Asia Pacific ..................................  7.4%                                                                                                                                   Sales                   Total -- $2.66 billion                                                                                                          Americas ...................................... 66.8%   Europe ........................................ 29.2%   Asia Pacific ..................................  4.0%                                                                                                          *As of June 1990; does not include about 500 joint-ventureemployees in Japan, Korea and Indonesia</TEXT></DOC>
