The article was originally published in theIsraeli newspaper Haaretz on Aug. 17. Mr. Sarid has longadvocated dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organizationand Ratz-CRM is generally considered to be the mostsympathetic of the Israeli political parties to thePalestinian position. This article touched off an outpouringof similar statements from the Israeli left doubting whethercompromise with Palestinians is possible.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   It has always been my position that two peoples haverights to the land of Israel-Palestine, Jews andPalestinians, and that the alternatives are therefore clear:either compromise and partition or endless war. It has alsobeen my position that Israel's rule of law is undermined bythe occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and by the humanrights violations that occur there. I have in the past urgedIsrael to negotiate with the PLO and I still believe thatsome compromise peace must be arrived at with the Palestinianpeople. But the endorsement of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait bythe PLO, by supposedly moderate Palestinians not affiliatedwith the PLO and even by many of the Arabs who live insideIsrael and hold Israeli citizenship has put a knife in theback of the peace process.   For years I have tried to explain to any Palestinian whowould listen that the Palestinian national movement must notbase its hopes on the Soviet Union. The leaders in theKremlin -- I said -- support the PLO today, but tomorrow, ifit is in their best interest, they will withdraw theirsupport. Only the Palestinians and Israel have anysubstantial interest in a solution to the Palestinianproblem. Such a self-explanatory statement invariably metwith furious objection. Palestinians really seemed to believethat the Soviet position would remain unchanged forever.   Now the Palestinians have found a new savior -- SaddamHussein. The Palestinian leaders, who have moved from one bedto another (and there is no Arab leader who has not sharedhis bed with them) have learned nothing. Would Saddam, who isready to sell his own mother, not sell them?   The PLO has dedicated the past two years to convincingIsraelis and others that it has changed, that it hasreconciled itself to the existence of the State of Israel andhas abandoned terrorism. The PLO has kicked that bucket over.   Saddam Hussein has already initiated two wars against hisneighbours. He who has gored a Moslem country as well as anArab country is an ox proven dangerous, who will mostcertainly be willing to gore the Jewish State. The IsraeliArabs must be aware of this imminent danger or they would notdemand to be supplied with gas masks for their defense. Andyet, polls suggest that 62% of these Arab Israeli citizenssupport Saddam Hussein. Two Arab Knesset members, Abdul WahabDarawshe and Muhammed Miari, have publicly backed Saddam aswell. How can these people find a kind word to say about theman who threatens to use chemical weapons against the countryin which they live -- and in which they claim to want tocontinue to live? For the first time Mr. Darawsheh and Mr.Miari have thrown doubt upon their loyalty to the state inwhich they claim citizenship. They will pay for this mistakedearly.   The Palestinian leadership, both inside and outside theWest Bank and Gaza, justify their support of Saddam Husseinby citing the corruption of the Kuwait emirs who invested thenation's capital in international businesses and not in the&quot;intifada&quot;. But Saddam has been no more generous to them: Heinvested billions of dollars of his nation's capital in anunnecessary war with Iran. He buried these billions togetherwith thousands of people. The Kuwait emirs may have beenrotten sovereigns, but if Yasser Arafat or Mr. Darawshe orone of the moderate Palestinians who has expressed sympathyfor Saddam, like Faisal Husseini, had to choose a place tolive -- in rotten Kuwait or revolutionary Iraq -- I have nodoubt which they would choose. In Kuwait, at least, theywould not be constantly under the danger of execution.   Pan-Arab slogans that glorify revolutionary regimes thattreat human rights with contempt are immensly hypocritical.When such slogans are used by local Palestinian leaders onewonders to what extent they have internalized and assimilatedthe democratic values of Israel.   If it is permissible to support Saddam Hussein -- whomurdered tens of thousands of &quot;regime opponents&quot; withoutblinking an eyelid, who gassed Kurds, men, women and children-- then it is perhaps not that bad to support the policy ofMr. Shamir, Mr. Sharon and Mr. Rabin. In comparison with thecrimes committed by Saddam Hussein, the sins of the state ofIsrael are snow white. When reading the black pages aboutIraq in Amnesty International's book on human rights in Iraq,one can conclude that Messrs. Sharon and Rabin are almostbenevolent. Mr. Arafat, Mr. Husseini and Mr. Darawsheh mustnot be surprised if the moral protest against the horrorscommitted in the occupied territories becomes in the future afaintly heard cry.   Had I supported the establishment of a Palestinian Stateonly because the Palestinians deserve a state I would nowwithdraw that support. However, I continue to demand theirright for self-determination and an independent state becauseit is my right to rid myself of the occupation and its evilinfluence. The Palestinians perhaps deserve the occupation,but we Israelis do not. But in my effort to free Israel fromthe burden of occupying the West Bank, I do not need Messrs.Arafat, Husseini and Darawsheh. Until now I have soughtoutthe Palestinian leadership, because I believed this wasthe only way to progress in the peace process. As far as I amconcerned, they can now look for me.</TEXT></DOC>
