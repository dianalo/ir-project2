The Commerce Department said the economy expanded at a 3.3% annual rate in the second quarter. That was only slightly faster than the department's estimate last month that the gross national product, the inflation-adjusted measure of economic activity, expanded at a 3.1% clip. But the stronger underlying rate of growth was masked by the fact that the drought is having a more severe impact than previously believed.    The department now estimates that the drought shaved a full percentage point off economic growth in the second quarter. Last month, it had said the drought slowed the economy by just half a percentage point.    Offsetting the more severe impact of the drought in the revised report were upward revisions in government spending, consumer spending and capital outlays by businesses.    The department also said after-tax profits of U.S. corporations in the second quarter increased 11.5% after a 2.5% rise in the first quarter, giving further evidence the pace of economic activity was brisk.    The GNP report added to fears of inflation. According to a broad measure of inflation called the deflator, prices rose at a revised annual rate of 5.1%, up sharply from the first quarter's 1.7% pace. The second-quarter rise, which previously was reported as 4.1%, was the largest gain since a 5.8% increase in the third quarter of 1982.    &quot;Once you cross the 5% mark in price increases, you have to start waving the red flags,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economist.    Another inflation yardstick, which measures the change in prices of a fixed basket of goods much as the consumer price index does, rose an unrevised 4.7% in the quarter, compared with a 3.5% rise in the first quarter.    Economists said they were concerned that the strong demand for goods, reflected in the GNP report by high sales, would continue to push factories to increase operating rates. They said that would put further upward pressure on prices, possibly provoking interest-rate increases that could halt the economic expansion.    &quot;We are approaching our destination at too fast a speed . . . and there is the risk now that we may crash,&quot; Mr. Ratajczak said.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, however, said the new GNP figure &quot;does not change the basic economic picture.&quot; He said the figure supports a number of positive economic conclusions, including that &quot;inflation remains low and under control.&quot;    Robert Wescott, a vice president at Alphametrics Corp. in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said he expects more price increases, led by accelerating food prices, in the next few months. &quot;So far, it has been mainly fruit, vegetable and grain prices that have gone up,&quot; he said. &quot;Meat prices are going to start moving up considerably and the food bill is going to soar.&quot;    Excluding government spending on farm programs, final sales -- a measure of demand in the economy -- moved up at a 6.2% annual rate in the second quarter, compared with a 5.6% rate of increase in the first quarter. Of the various measures of aggregate economic activity, this gauge is the least affected by drought losses, the department said. Mr. Ratajczak said this high demand indicated that the non-farm economy, already expanding at an annual rate of more than 4%, is likely to continue at this pace for the rest of the year.    The department said that inventory buildup in the second quarter was substantially less than it had previously reported. Business inventories grew by $36 billion in the quarter, $9 billion less than the department indicated a month ago. Inventories grew at a far slower pace in the second quarter than in the previous two quarters.    Even after the upward revision, consumer spending grew much more slowly in the second quarter than in the first. Household expenditures grew at a 2.7% annual rate after inflation, compared with a 4.5% pace in the first quarter. Spending on durable goods was up at an 8% rate, and that on services rose at a 3% clip. Consumption of non-durable goods, those intended to last less than three years, was unchanged.    Before inflation adjustment, second-quarter GNP ran at a $4.819 trillion annual rate, up from a $4.724 trillion pace in the first quarter.    The second quarter increase in profits brought them to a $166.6 billion annual rate from a $149.4 billion pace in the first quarter.    Profits from current production increased 5% to an annual pace of $332 billion from an unchanged first-quarter pace of $316.2 billion. This measure, considered by some analysts to be a better gauge of corporate health than after-tax profits, is adjusted to eliminate the effects of inflation on inventories and to reflect depreciation more accurately.    Profits before tax rose 8.6% to an annual rate of $310.7 billion after a 1.5% increase to $286.2 billion in the first quarter. Corporate cash flow increased 2.6% to an annual pace of $397.7 billion. In the first quarter, this measure increased 0.9% to a $387.8 billion annual rate.    Here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant (1982) dollars:                                  2nd Qtr.       1st Qtr.                                     1988           1988    GNP .......................... 3988.1         3956.1      less: inventory chng ......... 36.0           66.0      equals: final sales ........ 3952.1         3890.1    Components of Final Sales      Personal Consumption ....... 2577.2         2559.8      Nonresidential Invest. ...... 491.8          473.4      Residential Invest. ......... 190.0          189.5      Net Exports ................. -90.1         -109.0      Gov't Purchases ............. 783.3          776.4   In the second quarter, the implicit price deflator rose to 5.1% of the 1982 average, from 1.7% in the previous quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
