(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A novelist and former Oscarnominee jailed for stealing thousands of books from more than 70libraries in two countries was released 88 days early so he couldget back to work.   Jerry Gustav Hasford, 41, who co-wrote the screenplay for the1987 film ``Full Metal Jacket,'' had become a ``high-profileprisoner and the subject of verbal abuse from other prisoners,''said Orlan Donley, Hasford's attorney.   Hasford was released Tuesday, 28 days before he would have beeneligible for parole and 88 days before he would have finished hissix-month sentence.   Donley told Judge Warren Conklin of San Luis Obispo CountySuperior Court that Hasford had a chance to go to France to work ona movie based on a book he recently had published. Hasford is alsoworking on a deal with a publisher for three more books, Donleysaid.   Hasford's income depends on his writing and he can't write injail because of the harassment, the attorney argued.   Conklin said he released Hasford because the writer had a job,had agreed to pay restitution and agreed to let authoritiesdetermine which books belonged to him and which should be returned.Hasford can leave the state and country, but must report to hisprobation officer in writing, Conklin said.   Hasford wrote ``The Short-Timers,'' based on his experience as acombat correspondent with the 1st Marine Division during the TetOffensive of 1968.   Stanley Kubrick bought the rights to the book for ``Full MetalJacket,'' in which Hasford shares screenwriting credit with Kubrickand Michael Herr. The screenplay was nominated for an Academy Awardin 1987, but the honor went to authors of ``The Last Emperor.''   About 10,000 books were confiscated when Hasford was arrested,but charges against Hasford focused only on 2,000 books valued atabout $20,000. They were taken from public libraries in LosAngeles; Santa Monica; Sacramento; St. Louis; Longview, Wash.;London; and the city, county and university libraries in San LuisObispo.   Hasford pleaded no contest in January to possessing stolenproperty as part of a negotiated agreement with prosecutors, whodropped two criminal counts of grand theft.   Police officers at California Polytechnic State University inSan Luis Obispo have been storing the books since they wereconfiscated. Officer Raymond Berrett will decide which ones areHasford's and which ones belong to libraries, Donley said.</TEXT></DOC>
