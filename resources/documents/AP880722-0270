The freeze is the first since the breakup of the Bell System in1984 and may be the first ever for ATandamp;T, which was sheltered fromcompetition for most of its existence.   The freeze, which will last indefinitely, excludes only somecollege recruiting and ``jobs that are strategic to marketingefforts here and abroad,'' spokesman Burke Stinson said Thursday.   After shrinking steadily since 1984, when it divested theregional Bell telephone companies, ATandamp;T's employment has risen by12,000 since the beginning of this year.   ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen, who announced the plan toemployees in a closed-circuit television broadcast Wednesday, saidadministrative costs were rising too rapidly and he wanted toemphasize increasing sales.   On Wednesday, the company reported an unusually large 14 percentsecond-quarter increase in its selling, general and administrativeexpenses. That rise, which ATandamp;T now is moving to deal with,contributed to a 0.3 percent slippage in profits.   ATandamp;T is recruiting volunteers for sales and marketing jobs fromamong its 95,000 entry-level and second-level managers, althoughall managers are eligible, Stinson said.   ``We're moving people from field tents to the front line,''Stinson said. ATandamp;T continues to lose money in the computer businessand has been hard-pressed by competitors in long-distance telephoneservice, its bread-and-butter business. MCI Communications Corp.,its closest rival, this week reported record profit and revenue forthe latest quarter.   Stinson said Allen regards the employment increase this year asunacceptable, although one reason for the sharp rise is that ATandamp;Tbegan counting the 4,500 employees of ATandamp;T PhilipsTelecommunications, a European joint venture with NV Philips inwhich ATandamp;T took a majority interest earlier this year.   James E. Olson, Allen's predecessor, who died in April after about with colon cancer, oversaw a reduction of 27,000 employees inhis 1{ years at the helm.   ATandamp;T's employment fell from 374,000 at the time of divestitureon Jan. 1, 1984, to 365,200 at the end of 1984, 337,600 at the endof 1985, 316,900 at the end of 1986 and 303,000 at the end of 1987.It is now about 315,000.   Of the 3,000 people moving into sales, more than 1,000 alreadyhave been recruited, Stinson said. That is because the move toshift people into sales began in April in two ATandamp;T units, theBusiness Markets Group and Network Operations Group.</TEXT></DOC>
