(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tourists casually packedtheir cars and evacuated the Old Faithful complex today as awind-blown wildfire roared less than a mile away, while a river offire flowed within feet of two small towns on Yellowstone'snorthern border.   It was the first time in Yellowstone's 116-year history thatevacuations had been ordered near Old Faithful, park officials said.   The tourists at Old Faithful couldn't see any flames todaybecause a ridge blocked their view, but park spokeswoman MarshaKarle said the smoke in the park made it ``harder and harder tobreathe.''   The 500 to 600 visitors and non-essential employees at the hoteland campground complex near the park's most popular attraction wereordered to leave for safety reasons and to allow firefighters theaccess they need to protect structures, says spokeswoman JoanAnzelmo.   ``This is not a panic at all,'' she said.   Wendy Morrison of Scottsdale, Ariz., said a bellman knocked onher door at 6:45 a.m. and told her the National Park Service wasevacuating the area.   ``We kind of figured it was coming so it was not too much of ashock,'' Morrison said. ``We got in yesterday and were planning tostay through tomorrow.''   Winds gusting to 30 mph pushed the 144,700-acre North Fork blazeto within three-quarters of a mile of the complex early today.Embers carried by the wind started spot fires even nearer to thefamed geyser.   Firefighters in Cooke City, Mont., where the giant Storm Creekfire surged out of the park, hoped today that a stiff west windwouldn't shift enough to fan the flames across a 20-foot firebreakseparating the fire from the tiny tourist towns of Cooke City andSilver Gate at the park's northeast corner.   Overnight, wind blew parallel to the narrow east-west firebreak,and firefighters channeled the fire past the northern edge ofSilver Gate.   By this morning, the fire's leading edge was past Silver Gateand within a quarter mile of Cooke City, but still following the10- to 20-foot-wide firebreak channel.   sked how close the fire was to buildings, fire informationofficer Dave McMorran said: ``Zero. It's right up behind thebuildings.''   Officials hoped the fire's scorched path would protect the townsfrom a return.   At the Old Faithful complex, officials are confident they canprotect structures from the advancing flames. These include thehistoric, wooden Old Faithful Inn, two other lodges, hundreds ofcabins, a general store, a service station and a clinic.   On Tuesday, soldiers laid a 4,000-foot irrigation line to wetdown the area to divert the flames.   The blaze is among 13 major fires that have burned roughly 1million acres this summer in Yellowstone and the surroundingnational forests in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Inside the 2.2million-acre park, 634,000 acres are charred.   Firefighters wetted down buildings in Cooke City and Silver Gateas the 63,000-acre Storm Creek fire surged out of the park. Bothtowns, with a combined year-round population of 150, were orderedevacuated earlier Tuesday as the fire threatened from 1{ miles away.   Wind-blown embers landed on buildings but were quickly doused byfirefighters, who waged a nightlong effort to save the community.   Some firefighters sprayed rooftops just above a portable signthat read: ``Give it hell, guys. It ain't over 'til it's over.''   Firefighters cut Silver Gate's power Tuesday night to preventthe downing of live power lines. The town was lit only byspotlights, and the orange glow of the spot fire 200 yards away wasbright enough to read by.   David Liebersbach, fire commander at Silver Gate, estimatedfirefighters had a 25 percent chance of saving the town.   Other Montana fires also forced evacuations.   The 66,000-plus-acre Canyon Creek fire in west-central Montanagrew so quickly that officials had no accurate idea of its size,said Jane Weber of the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The growthprompted an evacuation of an undetermined number of cabins.   More than 30 cabins southwest of Augusta were ordered evacuated,Weber said. To the southwest across the Scapegoat Wilderness, theCanyon Creek fire forced evacuations north of Ovando, about 75miles northwest of Helena. And officials evacuated about 10 homesnear a new fire eight miles west of Glacier National Park.   In southwest Montana, firefighters began evacuating 12 to 15homes west of Darby as the Little Rock Creek fire spread to morethan 1,000 acres in the Bitterroot National Forest. The fire wasabout two miles from Darby today, but the town was not consideredthreatened, said fire information officer Paul Gyles.   Gov. Ted Schwinden on Tuesday banned all outdoor recreationoutside Montana's cities and towns due to the fire danger.   Elsewhere, a fire in parched grass and pine in centralWashington exploded from 160 acres Monday to more than 25,000 acresTuesday, sending firefighters fleeing, destroying at least onehouse and forcing the evacuation of a dozen others. State officialsclosed, but later re-opened, 40 miles of nearby U.S. 97 due tosmoke.   The fire, the largest of several in Washington, burned towardsome of the state's prime fruit orchards.   In Idaho, wind whipped a fire in the Nez Perce National Forestfrom 25,900 acres Monday to 36,780 by Tuesday night.   Campgrounds were evacuated about 225 miles north of SanFrancisco in the King Mountain Range, where a 1,150-acre fire wasburning and firefighters continued today to mop up the remnants ofwildfires that blackened more than 25,000 acres in SouthernCalifornia. Forests and grassland also burned in Oregon and Utah.   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, the coordinating office forfirefighting in the West, said fires this year have charred 3.65million acres, an area larger than Connecticut. Slightly more than2 million of the acres are in Alaska. During the last big fireseason, 1985, 2.8 million acres burned. The fire center has calledthis the worst fire season in 30 years.</TEXT></DOC>
