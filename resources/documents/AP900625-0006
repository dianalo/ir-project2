He was thrown into the breach against NorthKorean invaders.   Schuyler B. Cole was among the last. The war had bogged downroughly along the same line where it started, when soldiers diedover map points named Pork Chop Hill and Heartbreak Ridge.   Leslie Doyle Rader was killed at Inchon, when the Americansgained the offensive.   Fellow Marine William G. Windrich died a hero at the ChosinReservoir after Communist China entered the war. His tombstonenotes he won the Medal of Honor.   If the war didn't end with the clear-cut results some wanted,and if things aren't perfect in Korea today, well, nobody can faultthese men.   Yet the only national tribute to their deeds are their whitemarble headstones at Arlington National Cemetery. There is no patchof ground, no monument of carved black granite for Korean veterans.   Only now, 40 years later, is a memorial in the works.   Authorized by Congress in 1986, it will adjoin the LincolnMemorial across the reflecting pool from the Vietnam Memorial if$11 million in private contributions can be raised by 1991. About$6.2 million has been raised so far.   For the people who fought, bled or died in Korea, it's abouttime.   ``It's an overdue thank you,'' said retired Col. John F.C.Kenney, a member of the Korean War Veterans Association and formerexecutive director of the Korean War Memorial Advisory Board.   ``The nation owes some form of recognition to those who, withoutall the fanfare of a war to save the world, marched off quietly tofight for freedom for a people they never heard of because theircountry asked them to do so,'' Kenney said.   The memorial will have 38 statues of soldiers, each 8 feet tall,walking from a copse of trees toward an American flag. There willalso be a retaining wall to honor the combat dead.   ``We were the silent veterans of the forgotten war,'' says FrankKerr, a Boston public relations executive who fought with theMarines at Chosin. ``Those who died enobled that time and place. Itwas like a rock thrown in a pond and there wasn't a ripple.''   That forgotten war began June 25, 1950, when North Korean tanksclanked southward across the 38th parallel. It ended July 27, 1953,not with a final peace, but an armistice. About 43,000 U.S.soldiers are still in Korea, serving as a trip wire in case theNorth invades again.   Most Americans get their images of the Korean War from ``MASH''reruns; 40 percent of the country is too young to remember itfirsthand.   Korea was a nasty war. More artillery fell on it than was firedin all of World War II. In 37 months, 54,248 Americans died _33,629 of them in combat, the rest in accidents or from sickness.In Vietnam, the U.S. dead reached 58,149 in more than 10 years offighting.   There are 8,177 MIAs and 389 unaccounted-for POWs, all of thempresumed dead. Thirty-eight percent of American POWs died incaptivity.   Korea was a harbinger. Almost all the ingredients of Vietnamwere present in Korea _ East Asia, an undeclared, limited war, aconflict between northern communists and a southern republic, andAmerican war technology against a determined but ill-equipped foe.   But mostly, Korea was a war unlike any the American public everhad been asked to support. Americans watched with some fascinationas the U.S.-led United Nations troops were almost overrun, thencounterattacked all the way to North Korea, then were beaten backby hordes of Chinese troops.   One year after the shooting started, the lines stabilized atroughly the 38th parallel. Peace talks dragged on for two years,and 45 percent of the casaulties came after the stalemate on thebattlefield.   At first, most Americans in those communist-conscious timesapproved. But America soon was turned off by a no-win, stagnantwar. There were no patriotic ditties by Irving Berlin, but noanti-war songs either. There were no parades, but no draft-cardburnings or Kent States.   ``It fell off the front pages. It just sort of petered out in avery negative way. Nobody wanted to think about this thing,'' saidhistorian Clay Blair, author of ``Korea: The Forgotten War.''   ``When the war was over, people went back to their jobs anddidn't talk about it. When your country asked you to do something,you do it,'' said Dick Adams, former member of the 25th InfantryDivision and now president of the Korean War Veterans Association   Was Korea worth it?   Veterans say just ask anybody if they'd rather live in theNorth, one of the last vestiges of ironclad Stalinism, or in theSouth, a bustling, industrial power that was host to the 1988Olympic Games.   ``My view is we accomplished our mission in full,'' said Gen.Richard Stilwell, who commanded ground forces in Korea and nowheads the effort to build the Korean memorial. ``Korea was thecornerstone for defense and foreign policy that provided thebulwark of what is happening in Eastern Europe.''   ``It was a complete victory. We did what we set out to do. Westopped the communists. It was worth every inch of it,'' saidWilliam Norris of Waterford, N.Y., founder of the Korean WarVeterans Association.   The veterans group was formed in 1984. Norris' daughter wantedto do a school paper but couldn't find any library books on Korea,the place where her father fought and his buddies died.   ``It irritated me. I started it so nobody would ever forget,''Norris said.   The group already has remembered to remember. It placed agranite meditation bench near Arlington's Tomb of the UnknownSoldier on July 27, 1987.   It is carved with this quote from Herman Wouk: ``The beginningof the end of war lies in remembrance.''</TEXT></DOC>
