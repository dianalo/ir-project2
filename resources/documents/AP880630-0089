PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Afghan rebels have killed 10 Soviet soldiers byshelling garrisons since the Red Army began withdrawing fromAfghanistan, but the Soviets are no longer actively fighting theguerrillas, the military said.   About 20,000 Soviet soldiers have left Afghanistan since May 15,Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov said Wednesday.   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979. More than100,000 soldiers were helping the Marxist government fightU.S.-backed Moslem rebels before an agreement providing for theirwithdrawal was signed in April.   Gromov was in Moscow as a delegate to the 19th Communist Partyconference, representing soldiers in Afghanistan.   He denied reports by Western diplomats in Pakistan of rebelsuccesses in border areas that Soviet forces have abandoned.   Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov of the military general staff was alsoat the press conference.   ``From May 15 there were losses, not considerable, but about 10killed and 15 wounded,'' Gromov said.   ``They took place not while the withdrawal was being carried outbut as a result of shelling of our garrisons that were supplyingmateriel to other garrisons,'' he said.   ``The Soviet troops are not taking part in action,'' Gromovsaid, adding that his main problem ``is to avoid losses, on ourside and the other side, let alone the population.''   He said he could not give figures for casualties among theAfghan army or Moslem insurgents.   Soviet soldiers have been attacked near the eastern city ofJalalabad and other places along their route out of the country,Gromov said. ``But all these attempts were cut short. We had nolosses in men and materiel.''   Western diplomats in Pakistan have said that Soviet soldiers inthe Afghan city of Kandahar had to move to the airport outside ofthe city because of rebel pressure on the town itself.   The diplomats also have reported that rebels had taken theirfirst provincial capital, Kalat in neighboring Zabul province,thereby cutting a major road between Kandahar and the capital,Kabul.   Gromov called both reports false. Soviet soldiers supplyKandahar with food and other goods daily from the airport, he said.   ``I can say quite officially that Kalat was not captured,'' headded. ``The opposition couldn't capture Kalat. From the militarypoint of view it is only one more proof that the Afghan armedforces are capable of carrying out their duty.''   In Islamabad, Pakistan today, Western diplomatic sources saidMoslem guerrillas were still fighting for a provincial center justwest of Kabul. That contradicted rebel claims that they had drivencommunist forces from the area.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebelssucceeded in routing Soviet and Afghan government troops fromMaidan Shahr, 18 miles southeast of Kabul, on June 24.   However, the insurgents were pushed out a day later by communistartillery, the sources said. They said the battle was still raging.   Some guerrilla groups reported Sunday that the town was underrebel control, opening a new attack route to the heightsoverlooking western Kabul.</TEXT></DOC>
