The measure faces a stiff, uphill fight, but even if itisn't passed, it could become an election issue. Women andcivil-rights groups want the caps removed; business groupsand the Bush administration want them kept.</LP><TEXT>   Passing the new legislation, called the Equal RemediesAct, would be &quot;a significant milestone on the long journeytoward establishing equality for women in the workplace,&quot;said Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal DefenseFund. But a White House spokeswoman said President Bush stillviews the caps as &quot;an important and valuable part&quot; ofcivil-rights law.   The labor panel's voice vote helped fulfill a promise madeby a number of Senate and House Democrats when Congressenacted the 1991 civil-rights law last November. At the time,the Democrats agreed to the caps in order to win White Housebacking for the civil-rights bill, which for the first timeallowed victims of employment discrimination based on sex,disability or religion to seek compensatory and punitivedamages. But the Democrats pledged to support new legislationlater to remove the caps. Unlimited damages fordiscrimination against racial and ethnic minorities have longbeen allowed by law.   The damage ceilings for sex-discrimination range from$50,000 to $300,000, depending on the size of the employer.   Despite the committee's action, the measure facessubstantial opposition from Republican and Democraticlawmakers who are concerned about its impact on business, andfrom others who aren't eager to rejoin the damages issue sosoon.   In other action, the Labor Committee:   -- Approved, by voice vote, a bill to make the 1991civil-rights law apply to employees of Wards Cove PackingCo., in Alaska. A Supreme Court decision in the Wards Covecase, one of five 1989 high court rulings overturned by the1991 law, limited workers' ability to sue employers forunintended discrimination against minorities and women.   The new law shifted the legal burden back to the employer,to prove that the employment practice involved is a &quot;businessnecessity.&quot; But even though the Wards Cove case helped sparkthe law, it exempted Wards Cove from the new provision.   -- Voted 11-to-7 on party lines, with Democrats in themajority, for a bill that would toughen enforcement offederal child-labor rules.   -- Approved by voice vote a bill aimed at targeting jobtraining for disadvantaged adults and youths more to those ingreatest need.   The Bush administration opposed the child-labor bill andexpressed concerns about some of the job-training provisions.</TEXT></DOC>
