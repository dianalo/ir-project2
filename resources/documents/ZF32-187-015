(powerful optimizationprocedure) (technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bland, J.A.; Dawson, G.P.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Tabu search is a powerful optimization procedure that has beensuccessfully applied to a number of combinatorial optimizationproblems, including integer-programming and quadratic-assignmentproblems.andP;  The procedure is simple to implement, sufficientlyversatile to incorporate problem-specific constraints, and mayalso act as a control mechanism to monitor and direct the progressof other optimization routines.andP;  The paper explains thetabu-search mechanism, discusses the general procedure with theuse of simple examples, and details the important computationalconsiderations that affect the performance of the routine.andP;  Anelectronic-circuit design problem is used as an example of theapplication of tabu search.andP;  Finally, possible modifications tothe basic search procedure are indicated, together with lines offurther investigation.andP;  (Reprinted by permission of the publisher)andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer-Aided DesignDesignSearchingOptimizationLayoutInteger Programming.andO;Feature:   illustrationcharttable.andO;Caption:   Series of moves within the solution space.
