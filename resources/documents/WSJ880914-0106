Now, he believes the time has come for a new space adventure: dolls in orbit.    &quot;That's right,&quot; Mr. Davis says, hunching forward as if the wrong people may be listening. &quot;We'll send up dolls in our rockets. We'll recover them after splashdown and market them with certificates and a tape of the countdown. It'll be bigger than Cabbage Patch Kids, easy.&quot;    The commercialization of space is about to enter a new era, for better or worse. Shooting rockets for profit has been a business long on glamour and short on cash flow, as most space entrepreneurs have discovered in recent years. But Mr. Davis aims to change that. The folksy, 56-year-old engineer came out of semi-retirement last year to found E Prime Aerospace Corp., which he says is poised to dominate the private sector's effort to make money in space.    On Oct. 6, E Prime plans to launch a 14-foot unmanned rocket from Cape Canaveral. On board will be four fairly low-tech experiments (including one from a Georgia high school) and a few prototype dolls. E Prime concedes it won't make much money on this launch, but it hopes a successful mission will attract business.    To help him, Mr. Davis has assembled an over-the-hill gang of aging flyboys and rocket experts, most of them old pals from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and aerospace companies whom he coaxed out of retirement. Their goal: &quot;To put America back in space, and in the lead,&quot; Mr. Davis says. &quot;My guys can do it because we're the same guys who did it before. Our potential is vast.&quot;    Many people in the space business think what's vast is Mr. Davis's capacity for self-promotion. So far, E Prime has only about 25 employees, no cash flow and just $2 million in financing from an investor whose identity Mr. Davis won't disclose. What is notable, though, is that E Prime is planning a launch without any government money or assistance -- the first entirely private launch ever, Mr. Davis claims.    Some people dispute that, but the little rocket will be the first privately launched spaceship since the Challenger disaster, and it carries some weight in American business's struggle to capitalize on space. &quot;They're going to be pioneers,&quot; says Chris Shove, director of the Florida Commerce Department's space programs office.    Not everyone sees it that way. &quot;This guy is throwing up a lot of smoke. I put up the first private rocket six years ago,&quot; says Deke Slayton, the former astronaut whose Houston-based Space Services Inc. blasted a rocket off from Matagorda Island in Texas in September 1982. &quot;He's shooting off a 14-footer. That's a toy. We put up a real rocket.&quot;    True, Mr. Slayton's 37-foot rocket flew 195 miles into space and fell back to Earth in less than 10 minutes. In contrast, Mr. Davis's will chug up to only 20,000 feet and return to Earth in a relatively long period -- 15 minutes. A lot of weekend airplane pilots go higher and faster. But Mr. Slayton hasn't put up a rocket since that initial flight, mainly because potential customers can't come up with the $10 million to $20 million it would cost.    Government space officials say the question of who can claim the distinction is a matter of definitions, most of which only a rocket scientist would understand. Anyway, Mr. Davis figures he has the last word on the subject.    &quot;We've checked with the people at Guinness, and we're going into the Book of World Records,&quot; he says.    In any case, many space experts see E Prime's launch as significant. Until the Challenger blew up in January 1986, the shuttle had been the main means by which private companies could put their communications satellites into orbit or conduct their space-based experiments.    The shuttle has been grounded since that disaster. Shortly afterwards, President Reagan ordered most commercial payloads off the shuttle and encouraged private industry to take over space ventures. But because the costs are huge and development capital scarce, foreign consortiums with public financing have taken over most of the launch business. Arianespace, the French launch system financed partly by the government, now controls about 75% of a world launch backlog valued at $4 billion.    For a group that hopes to reconquer space for America, Mr. Davis and his team have a modest set-up. Headquarters is a stucco building down the road from Cape Canaveral. The building used to be a hotel but looks more like a dentist's renovated office. Mr. Davis's wife, Betty, answers telephones and helps run the office.    Nor does the team always seem particularly, well, scientific. &quot;How does this thing work,&quot; mutters Mr. Davis, punching buttons on his office VCR in hopes of playing a tape of a recent rocket test. &quot;Push that one,&quot; offers a colleague who helped design guidance systems for the Apollo moonshots. &quot;No, that one,&quot; suggests a third scientist. Suddenly the screen goes blank. &quot;What did I do?&quot; Mr. Davis implores.    Even if they haven't mastered all the Earthbound technologies, Mr. Davis's team knows rockets. A typical member is Jack Dowling, 57, who spent 25 years building tracking stations for NASA all over the world before retiring to nearby Cocoa Beach. He heard about E Prime from a friend, dropped by for a chat and decided to come out of retirement. &quot;Bobby's got a vision,&quot; Mr. Dowling says. &quot;And it's a hell of a lot more interesting than gardening.&quot;    It is also apparently more interesting than fertilizer-plant construction, which is what Mr. Davis had been doing at the time of the Challenger disaster. He broke into the rocket game as a Boeing Co. engineer in the 1950s and later helped design the capsules that mapped the lunar surface, and the ground support systems for the Saturn rockets that put men on the moon. He was in Arkansas one snowy day when he caught the president's TV speech urging the privatization of space.    &quot;I figured that was the time to get back into it,&quot; he says. Another factor: He had been a friend of Francis R. Scobee, one of the astronauts who died in the Challenger disaster. &quot;It hurt.&quot;    E Prime has had a rough ride so far. An early attempt to form a company crashed after a legal fight with a former partner and some investors over a contract dispute. E Prime originally had hoped to launch its first rocket by October 1987, but clearance from the Air Force and other government groups for such things as renting a Cape Canaveral launch pad was slow in coming. &quot;We'd say, 'We want to do this,'&quot; Mr. Davis recalls. &quot;They'd say, 'Sounds great.' Then we wouldn't hear from anybody for months.&quot;    Mr. Davis says he has been flooded with requests for berths on future flights since announcing the October launch. For future launches, E Prime can provide much larger rockets, stitched together from modified Peacekeeper missile parts and other components, he says.    &quot;We have discovered that, by God, this is a business,&quot; he says, waving an inchthick stack of computer printouts he says is a list of recent inquiries from potential customers. &quot;It's enormous.&quot;    Some people think Mr. Davis has stars in his eyes. &quot;Once the current backlog is shot into space, the question becomes what else is there to launch,&quot; says one government space specialist. &quot;There is a school of thought that believes many of these entrepreneurs are dreaming when they talk about the big bucks.&quot;    Adds another government expert: &quot;The question about Mr. Davis is whether all his big talk means he's the pioneer private space executive, or just space's first used car salesman.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
