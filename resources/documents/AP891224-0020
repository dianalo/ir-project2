It must be Christmastime.   While Christian leaders bemoan the commercialization ofChristmas, other religious groups are reporting revived interest intheir own traditions in reaction to the relentless secular presenceof the holiday.   ``What that reflects, frankly, is the attempt ... to compensatefor the overwhelming presence of Christmas in American society,''said Rabbi A. James Rudin, national interreligious affairs directorof the American Jewish Committee.   Rudin said there has been a ``mismatch'' because the Jewish andChristian holidays fall near each other but are not equal inimportance.   ``One is a minor Jewish holiday. One is a major Christianholiday,'' Rudin said. ``The truth is Christmas is not theChristian Hanukkah and Hanukkah is not the Jewish Christmas.''   But that has not stopped Hanukkah, the eight-day Jewish Feast ofLights that began Friday evening, from becoming an importanttradition in the United States. Surveys showed more than two-thirdsof all Jewish people in the United States light Hanukkah candles, aritual surpassed only by attendance at a Passover Seder.   Among many Buddhists, special emphasis has been placed on theDec. 8 celebration of Bodhi Day, the day they believe the Buddhabecame enlightened.   The Rev. Carol Himaka, education director of the BuddhistChurches of America in San Francisco, said Bodhi Day is being morewidely observed ``because of the need to have our own young peoplerecognize our own tradition.''   Still, she said, many Buddhists celebrate Christmas the way alot of non-devout Christians mark the holiday _ with trees andpresents and little regard for the religious significance of thebirth of the person Christians believe is the son of God.   ``It's more difficult to explain to young children, especially,why they should not celebrate Christmas,'' she said.   The Bahais, who say Jesus was a prophet sent by God, do notbelieve there is a spiritual conflict in observing Christmas,according to Katharine Bigelow, deputy director of the BahaiNational Office of External Affairs in Washington.   ``I don't observe Christmas with my Bahai friends, but with myfamily who is all Christian, I look forward to celebrating withthem,'' she said.   Some Moslem leaders attending the Seerah Conference sponsored bythe Council of Masajid of United States over Christmas weekend saidthat while Jesus also is a respected figure in their faith, alltrappings of Christmas should be avoided.   ``We want our children to know about our religion and an Islamicperspective,'' said Habib Malik, a teacher with the Muslim WorldLeague in Philadelphia.   ``We are concerned when we see some Moslem families bringingChristmas trees home.''   Imam Shamsher Ali, director of the Islamic Religious Center ofLong Island, said Moslem religious leaders emphasize at Fridayprayer sessions before Christmas that their faith teaches Jesus wasa prophet of God, but not the son of God.   Competition with Christmas is not always a positive thing, otherreligious leaders said.   Rudin remembers being told as a child to be thankful he wasJewish and receiving gifts for eight days during Hanukkah, while``those quote `poor Christians' were only going to get gifts forone day.''   His advice: ``Let Hanukkah be Hanukkah.''   Some celebrations this time of year are not tied to any religion.   Kwanzaa, a holiday modeled on traditional African harvestcelebrations, is observed by some black Americans. It beginsTuesday and runs through Jan. 1.   And the Southern California wing of Atheists United exchangedgifts Thursday afternoon to mark the winter solstice.   ``Basically, it's a time to party,'' said Atheists UnitedPresident Alexander Prairie.</TEXT></DOC>
