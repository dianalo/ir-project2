No one expects a deliberate shrinking of Soviet oilexports despite this week's coup. But experts on Sovietenergy said oil prices over coming weeks depend in part onwhether coal miners heed the call of Boris Yeltsin, Russia'spresident, for widespread strikes to undo the new junta.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Internal demand for oil in the Soviet Union would jump asa result,&quot; said Peter Bogin, assistant director for oilmarkets in the Paris office of Cambridge Energy ResearchAssociates. That, in turn, would lead to a reduction in theflow of Soviet oil into the world's delicately balanced oilmarket.   Yesterday, the Soviet Union apparently continued tomaintain oil exports at near recent rates of some 2.2 millionbarrels a day, nearly all destined for Europe. But oilmarkets reacted again with violent swings over concern ofpossible disruptions in the flow of oil from the world'slargest producer.   In U.S. trading, after Monday's big price run-up, crudefutures yesterday ended generally lower, with oil for Octoberdelivery settling at $22.40 a barrel, down three cents. Butin London's futures market, the October Brent blend crudeclosed at $20.65 a barrel, up 12 cents.   Because of uncertainties over Soviet supplies, manyanalysts expect prices of crude oil to rise sharply as demandincreases seasonally in the weeks ahead. &quot;We may have a verytight situation out there in the fourth quarter,&quot; said RobertC. Baker, senior energy analyst at Prudential Securities inNew York.   Mr. Baker expects the chief U.S. crudes such as West TexasIntermediate, or WTI, to increase to $23 or $24 a barrel inthe fourth quarter. In London, Peter Gignoux, director of theinternational energy desk for Shearson Lehman Brothers,suggested WTI may reach $25 by year's end.   Heating oil already is showing surprising strengthworld-wide. In U.S. futures trading, the price of heating oiljumped 1.36 cents a gallon yesterday. The Soviet Unionexports large volumes of gasoil, or heating oil, to EasternEurope. That would be the chief fuel diverted internally inthe case of widespread coal strikes.   Thane Gustafson, a Soviet expert with Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates, said in Washington that it is morelikely for the coal workers to strike than the oil workers.&quot;There definitely will be disturbances in the coal mines, andthat will require oil and gas to be diverted,&quot; he said.   The disruptions may already have begun. There were reportsyesterday that miners are walking off their jobs in Siberiaand in the Soviet Far North. And Soviet coal inventoriesalready were low because of previous strikes, in 1989 andearly this year.   Even minimal new disruptions in coal production may forcethe Soviets to divert oil to replace it. And the Soviet Unionuses some eight million barrels a day of the oil it produces.Total output is expected to average less than 10.3 million aday for the year.   According to oil analyst Bernard Picchi and Soviet expertIgor Falaleyev, who together have been studying Soviet energypolicy for Salomon Brothers Inc., coal strikes can onlyworsen an already bad situation. They report that there werewidespread fuel shortages even before the coup, one reasonwhy exports are below those of a year ago.   &quot;There's not even enough gasoline,&quot; Mr. Falaleyev said.And Mr. Picchi was predicting before the coup that Sovietexports of crude and products would fall by one-third thisyear to about 2.1 million barrels a day.   Soviet production has been on the decline as well. KeithHamm of Petroleum Economics Ltd. in London pegged Soviet oiloutput in June at 10.1 million barrels a day, its lowestlevel in a decade.   Oil workers, nowhere near as radical as the coal miners,will likely stay on the job, Soviet experts predict, eventhough Mr. Yeltsin has called on people from every walk oflife there to oppose the new leaders through civildisobedience. But whether the oil still will move to marketis another question. Transportation of the oil could bedisrupted by sabotage. Principal oil and gas export pipelinespass through the Western Ukraine, which is in the hands ofthe democrats and Ukrainian nationalists, who are likely toreact strongly to the coup.</TEXT></DOC>
