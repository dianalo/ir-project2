Speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve soon will tighten its credit clamp to keep inflation under control, but Fed officials say they need more evidence before they're convinced that the economy is growing too rapidly or that inflation is an increasing threat.    The Fed officials' comments suggest that while the Fed may feel compelled to raise interest rates at some point, for the moment policy is likely to be unchanged.    &quot;The trade numbers were blown out of proportion by the markets, as usual,&quot; says Robert Forrestal, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. He was referring to last week's report that the trade deficit widened to $13.83 billion in February from $12.4 billion in January. He says his forecast of the economy's performance &quot;hasn't changed in the last month,&quot; despite several government reports last week that surprised many bond traders.    Oil prices, considered by many investors to be a highly sensitive barometer of inflation pressure, surged early in the day on news of U.S.-Iran military action in the Persian Gulf. Bonds quickly slumped, with prices of actively traded Treasury issues falling three-quarters of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    That brought their total decline since the trade figures were released last Thursday morning to about three points. The yield on the most actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 9.02% yesterday from 8.74% late last Wednesday.    Gary Stern, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, agrees that investors have overreacted. &quot;I don't view the trade figures as that bad, or such a surprise,&quot; he says. And while the 0.6% rise in producer prices reported Friday &quot;is higher than I'd like to see,&quot; Mr. Stern says he thinks &quot;we need more information before we can accurately assess the situation.&quot;    &quot;If you exclude food and energy, producer prices were not out of line with what's been posted for the last three or four months,&quot; agrees Roger Guffey, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo. The latest numbers haven't changed his view of the economic outlook, he says, but the threat of higher inflation &quot;is certainly worth keeping an eye on.&quot;    All of the Fed officials expressed concern about allowing the economy to grow too rapidly in the coming months. Fast growth, they fear, could cause inflation to accelerate, and also cause U.S. imports to rise, preventing progress in narrowing the trade deficit.    But none of them believe the economic data released last week provide enough evidence to cause concern. &quot;The national economy is performing a little better than I would have anticipated earlier this year, but not that much more,&quot; said Dallas Fed President Robert H. Boykin. Adds Mr. Forrestal: &quot;I don't like to rely on just one month's numbers.&quot;    Fed officials are also wary of making a policy move that would have to be reversed later. The central bank has already made that mistake once this year. It eased policy slightly amid signs of a weak economy in early January, and then had to reverse the move and tighten policy earlier this month as signs of economic strength emerged.    Mr. Stern also notes that the financial markets have proven to be an unreliable guide to economic trends in the past year or so. Every time the markets have become convinced that an economic trend was in the works, something has happened to reverse that trend.    Even if the Fed leaves its credit policy unchanged, several analysts say banks probably will raise their prime lending rate soon. The prime, or base rate now is 8 1/2%.    An 8 3/4% prime rate could come any day, some analysts say, because of the recent increase in the closely watched federal funds rate. The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans between banks, has hovered between 6 3/4% and 6 7/8% recently. That is up from its previous range of 6 1/2% to 6 3/4%. The small increase in the funds rate was engineered by the Federal Reserve in an effort to slow the economy, combat inflation fears and bolster the dollar.    While analysts question whether a prime rate increase is justified right now, they also say banks long have demonstrated much greater speed in raising the prime rate than in cutting it.    In the credit markets yesterday, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 declined to 98 1/2 from 99 1/4 last Friday and 101 14/32 as recently as last Wednesday. As recently as March 3, the issue traded at 106 5/32, to yield 8.31%.    &quot;The market still is weak and very defensive, but we think the tone is going to start improving,&quot; said Roger A. Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions, a Mount Kisco, N.Y., bond market forecasting and advisory service. &quot;We're looking for greater stability&quot; now that Treasury bond yields have pierced the 9% barrier.    Among other actively traded issues, the Treasury's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 fell yesterday to 95 1/2 from 95 31/32. The yield rose to 8.82% from 8.74%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds dropped 8.76 points to 1244.03. It finished the session only slightly above its low for the day of 1243.72. The high was 1249.82.    The Treasury sold new short-term bills yesterday at lower rates than at last week's auction. The average rate on new 13-week bills fell to 5.78% from 5.98% a week ago, while the average rate on new 26-week bills fell to 6.14% from 6.19%. Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                13-Week           26-Week    Applications ......... $27,243,855,000   $19,808,235,000    Accepted bids ........  $6,401,940,000    $6,409,045,000    Accepted at low price              81%               11%    Accepted noncompet'ly     $871,170,000      $879,900,000    Average price (Rate)     98.539(5.78%)     96.896(6.14%)    High price (Rate) ....   98.541(5.77%)     96.921(6.09%)    Low price (Rate) .....   98.536(5.79%)     96.881(6.17%)    Coupon equivalent ....           5.95%             6.42%   Both issues are dated April 21.
