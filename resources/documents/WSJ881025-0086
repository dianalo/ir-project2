Rospatch immediately rejected the bid. It also said it received -- and rejected -- a separate offer from THT Inc., which proposes acquiring Rospatch for $28 a share, including $25 in cash and the remainder in stock.    Atlantis, which makes plastics and furniture, said that it currently holds 462,100 of Rospatch's 2.5 million shares, an 18.4% stake, and that it has been a Rospatch holder for more than a year. In a letter to Rospatch's management, Earl W. Powell, Atlantis chairman and chief executive officer, said Atlantis is tired of waiting around for Rospatch to do something to &quot;enhance the value of its shares.&quot;    Rospatch, a wood products and defense systems maker in Grand Rapids, Mich., called the proposals by both Atlantis and THT &quot;contrary to the best interests of our corporation and our shareholders.&quot; It said it is considering a number of options to boost shareholder value, including the sale of its defense systems business.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Rospatch shares closed at $22.75, up 25 cents.    In its letter, Atlantis said its offer remains subject to several conditions, including the redemption by Rospatch of a &quot;poison pill&quot; shareholder rights plan. </TEXT></DOC>
