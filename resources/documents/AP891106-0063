SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Communist Party Central Committeetoday began preparing its program for an upcoming nationwidecongress that aims to revamp the party and revive its flaggingfortunes.   During the course of a daylong plenum, the committee planned todebate ideological changes, the preliminary program and the party'sposition on the economic program of the new Solidarity-ledgovernment.   ``We are meeting in an atmosphere shaped by unfavorable socialmoods. Thus, the bigger are party expectations for a boldprogrammatic offer,'' the official news agency PAP quoted partyleader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski as telling the meeting.   Continuing a practice started earlier this fall, the partybriefly allowed reporters in for the opening of the session beforeclosing the plenum for debate.   The future course of the party became a key issue after thePolish Communist Party became the first in the East bloc to losecontrol of the government with the Aug. 24 election of PrimeMinister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.   In an interview with the party daily Trybuna Ludu, Politburomember Leszek Miller said the most important issues ``are thequestions not about what we want to achieve, but how we want to doit.''   An internal survey of the party conducted in September indicatedthat 72 percent of the members favored a complete retooling of theparty, starting with its name.   The Central Committee also planned to discuss procedures for theelection of delegates to the party congress that are supposed to beheld under new democratic rules.   It was decided at a plenum Oct. 3 that the election of thedelegates should occur by Dec. 20.   Top party members have said the party will transform itself intoa broad party of leftist and social democratic forces at thecongress in January.   A party official who refused to be named said one of the mostimportant issues at the plenum would be discussion of the party'sposition on the Mazowiecki government's economic reform program,which aims to introduce a market-style economy.   ``In the conditions of the market economy, the realization ofthe principles of justice as well as other leftist values isespecially difficult ... There are no ready recipes,'' Miller saidin the newspaper interview. </TEXT></DOC>
