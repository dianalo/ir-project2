Behbehani, professor of political science at Kuwait University, commenting on an Israeli rapprochement with the Soviet bloc in the August/September issue of Middle East Insight:    It would most certainly grant Israel the opportunity to further increase the concentration of its population in the territories it has occupied since June 1967. As far as Israeli-Soviet and East European bloc relations are concerned, it would allow more Jews to emigrate to Israel. If this happens, then one is faced with a level of immigration similar to that which preceded the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. The next consequence, if Soviet-Israeli relations are so furthered, will be that the Soviets will not support any of the PLO's demands against Israel. This will bring strategic, regional and international implications in its train.    ---   Judge Danny J. Boggs of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in a concurrence to the court's opinion that fundamentalist Christian parents could not stop a school board from assigning certain textbooks:    For myself, I approach this case with a profound sense of sadness. At the classroom level, the pupils and teachers had in most cases reached a working accommodation. Only by the decisions of higher levels of political authority, and by more conceptualized presentations of the plaintiffs' positions, have we reached the point where we must decide these harsh questions today. The school board faced what must have seemed a prickly and difficult group of parents, however dedicated to their children's welfare. In a similar situation, the poet Edwin Markham described a solution: &quot;He drew a circle that shut me out/Heretic, Rebel, a thing to flout./But Love and I had the wit to win:/We drew a circle that took him in!&quot;    ---   From economist Arnold C. Harberger's &quot;Economic Policy and Economic Growth,&quot; published by the Institute for Contemporary Studies:    Most of us would agree with the late Harry G. Johnson in considering it more appropriate, when it comes to the human side, to think of poor people, not poor countries. Far too often financial or other aid that was motivated by humanitarian values has ended up being creamed off by governmental elites or other power groups whose living standards were not much different from those of legislators and bureaucrats in the industrialized (developed) countries. Humanitarian aid, when given, should find its way to those groups and classes in society by whose position or plight it was motivated. . . .    One cannot legislate poverty out of existence in such a country. The state of underdevelopment for an economy stems from the low productivity of the great mass of the people. The only tried and true way out of that state is to fundamentally improve their productivity. For this, the most obvious route is investment in human capital. The second clear route is the accumulation of physical capital. . . .    {T}he world's recent economic history contains much to be proud of. It is probably true that for the poor people of the world the quarter-century between 1950 and 1975 was the best quarter-century in history. We should not forget this basic fact. While we inquire as to what mistakes were made, and as to where we went wrong, we should also ask ourselves what we did right. </TEXT></DOC>
