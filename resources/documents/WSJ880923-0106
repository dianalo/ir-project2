Board Calls Off Pact With KKR --- Publisher Doesn't Respond To Higher Maxwell Bid Of About $2.51 Billion </HL><AUTHOR> Cynthia Crossen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MLL </CO><IN> TNM PUB </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Macmillan Inc., faced with a higher bid for the company, called off for now its agreement to be acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in a leveraged buy-out valued at $85 a share, or $2.36 billion.    Macmillan's board, which met yesterday, also said it would &quot;take no position at this time&quot; on the higher bid, a tender offer of $86.80 a share, or $2.51 billion, from Maxwell Communication Corp., a London-based communications conglomerate.    Macmillan said KKR is &quot;studying its alternatives and may amend&quot; its tender offer. The publishing and information-services concern added that its board will consider the Maxwell offer, as well as bids from any other interested parties.    Securities analysts said they believed that Macmillan still hopes to be acquired by KKR, but couldn't accept its lower offer with a higher one on the table, because that would leave the board open to shareholder suits. The analysts said Macmillan probably will continue to negotiate with Robert Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell Communication, in the hope of persuading him to buy a small part of the company instead of the whole thing. If that happens, they said, KKR probably will make a slightly higher bid.    The board's decision pushed up Macmillan's share price slightly, as investors speculated that a higher bid would emerge. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the shares closed at $86.875, up 50 cents.    Macmillan agreed to the leveraged buyout by KKR early last week, after trying for more than four months to fend off takeover bids by Robert M. Bass Group and Mr. Maxwell. Mr. Bass has dropped out of the battle, but late last week, Mr. Maxwell increased his offer for the company to the $86.80-a-share level.    On Wednesday, Robert S. Pirie, a financial adviser to Mr. Maxwell, sent a letter to Edward P. Evans, Macmillan's chairman and chief executive officer, asking the board to amend Macmillan's preferred stock purchase rights, or &quot;poison pill.&quot; Mr. Pirie suggested that the rights plan not apply to any bid of at least $85 a share, the price that Macmillan had determined to be fair in accepting the offer from KKR, an investment banking concern based here.    Mr. Pirie said that if the plan was amended, Mr. Maxwell wouldn't engage in a &quot;street sweep,&quot; a strategy in which an acquirer seeks to gain control of a company by buying all available stock rather than by making an offer to all holders.    After the meeting yesterday, Macmillan's board said that it would leave the rights plan intact &quot;to protect the ongoing auction process.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
