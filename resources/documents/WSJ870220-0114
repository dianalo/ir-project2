Its Supreme Court can find a way to relieve Texaco of the absurd $12.4 billion award to Pennzoil for winning the battle for Getty Oil, or it can complete the poisoning of the state's business well. Hard times in the oil patch suggest this is not the time for an already pro-plaintiff legal system to become the nation's lode for damage awards.    The issue is whether Texaco committed the tort of interfering with a contract. Did Pennzoil have a contract to merge with Getty before Getty decided to sell itself to Texaco? Did Texaco knowingly interfere with such a contract? How much does Texaco owe? So far as we can tell from reading the briefs and the precedents, the answers are no, no and zero. The trial judge got all three issues wrong in his instructions to the jury. The result is what we've called the Texas common law massacre.    It may seem strange that the Texas courts are handling the case since it is New York law that applies, but that's one of the quirks of federalism. Pennzoil and Texaco agreed that New York contract law governs, but Pennzoil decided to bring its case in Texas, which has jurisdiction because Texaco also does business there. An appeals court last week upheld Judge Solomon Casseb Jr.'s verdict.    As we read New York law, Pennzoil did not have a contract to merge with Getty. A joint press release of Jan. 4, 1984, announced an &quot;agreement in principle.&quot; Pennzoil admitted it was &quot;subject to the execution of a merger agreement.&quot; Getty decided to accept a higher bid from Texaco instead. Texaco's lawyers pleaded with Judge Casseb that he tell the jury that there is a fundamental difference between an &quot;agreement to agree&quot; and a legally binding contract. The New York attorney general filed a brief backing Texaco, saying that Judge Casseb's instructions &quot;failed to describe the pertinent New York law accurately&quot; and thus &quot;served to mislead the jury.&quot; In a speech last spring, Judge Casseb admitted that he probably misunderstood New York law.    Despite all this, the Texas appeals court blinked. The key issue was dismissed in but two sentences of the 162-page opinion: &quot;Generally, the trial judge should submit appropriate instructions, when requested. However, the failure to do so is not reversible error per se.&quot; In other words, Judge Casseb goofed, but we're not going to do anything about it. The court also ignored the not unimportant fact that Pennzoil couldn't have contracted to merge with Getty anyway because it had made a tender offer. SEC Rule 10b-13 says that once a tender offer begins, the offeror can't buy stock of the target except via the tender until the offer is withdrawn.    Even if there somehow was a binding contract for Texaco to interfere with, the damage award is ghoulish. Before interest started to run, the damages were $7.5 billion in &quot;actual&quot; damages and $3 billion in punitive damages. The actual damages figure reflects Pennzoil's pie-in-the-sky claim. The usual rule would have made the award the difference between the market value of Getty stock at the time of the purported breach of contract and Pennzoil's offering price. This comes to something less than $500,000.    Pennzoil suggested the multibillion figure as what it would cost it to drill for the amount of oil reserves that Getty owned. This is absurd. Texaco paid $10.2 billion for Getty -- less than the damage award -- so Pennzoil would be getting Getty for free.    The appeals court acknowledged that it could reduce damages if &quot;the amount was so excessive as to shock a sense of justice of the appellate court.&quot; Moody's gives Texaco senior debt its speculative-grade Ba-1 rating, and Texaco threatens bankruptcy. The court was not shocked. It didn't touch the actual damages award and only reduced the punitive damage award to a cool $1 billion.    A settlement is unlikely, given the spread in damages expectations of the two sides. Texaco will appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. The justices won't want to overrule the two lower courts, but they also won't want to be overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court, which would be Texaco's next port of call. Also, once the case is out of the Texas courts, Texaco will not treat so gingerly the touchy topic of the big judicial campaign contributions to key judges, after the case was filed, by Joe Jamail, Pennzoil's lawyer. In particular, Texaco says it was denied a fair trial because of Mr. Jamail's $10,000 contribution to the judge who heard the first three months of the case, and because Judge Casseb admits he read only three of the cases cited as precedents.    The justices have an out. They can &quot;certify&quot; the legal issue of when an informal agreement becomes a contract as one best resolved by New York courts. This would send the case to New York's highest court.    All along, we have emphasized that we have no love for Texaco or animus toward Pennzoil. Our devotion is to the Anglo-American common law, which -- until Judge Casseb's jury instructions -- made sure business people knew when they had a legally binding deal and when they didn't.    The most basic difference between developed Western nations and less prosperous places in the Third and Communist worlds is that property rights are protected by the rule of law in one but not in the other. Texas justices might keep this in mind when they decide whether to bring down a company whose biggest mistake was doing any business in Texas, thus subjecting itself to Texas justice. </TEXT></DOC>
