You claim &quot;the Farm Credit System got into trouble after1971, when Congress gave it permission to broaden and expandits lending to non-farm rural homeowners and liberalized loanrequirements to farmers.&quot; First, our rural home-mortgageprogram, limited by law to communities under 2,500 people,actually performed quite well throughout that period and hadnothing whatever to do with our financial problems. Second,the Farm Credit System was profitable throughout the 1970sand &quot;got into trouble&quot; in the early 1980s for macroeconomicreasons, particularly high interest rates and the disastrousplunge in farmland values that devastated so much of ruralAmerica.</LP><TEXT>   As a single-purpose lender restricted to agriculture andthe largest originator of real-estate loans to farmers, thefate of Farm Credit was -- and is -- inextricably tied to thehealth of the national farm economy.   You also try to link the Farm Credit System to the currentSandamp;L debacle. Two big differences: With Farm Credit, there wasnever any hint of fraud or deceit behind our financialproblems; and with Farm Credit, the assistance will berepaid. Congress authorized up to $4 billion in bonds for thesystem, of which less than half is likely to be needed. AsU.S. farms are recovering, so too is the Farm Credit System.   Finally, you ignored the fact that Farm Credit already hasin place most of the key elements recommended in the TreasuryDepartment's GSE report: A strong and independent &quot;safety andsoundness&quot; regulator (the Farm Credit Administration), whichis financed by system institutions, not by taxpayers;risk-based, permanent capital standards (similar to orgreater than those for federally chartered banks); asystem-financed insurance fund to protect against default;and tighter management that has cut operating costs.   The real wild card is Treasury's blithe demand fortriple-A bond ratings for GSEs, absent &quot;agency status.&quot; Thetruth is, Treasury does not know what would be necessary forGSEs to attain a triple-A rating, and ignores completely howthis might affect the cost of funds and loss of credit tosectors served by GSEs. For anyone who cares aboutagriculture, housing and education, that issue needs to beexplored fully before rushing to judgment.   Peter C.
