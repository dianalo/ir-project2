The computer giant picked American PsychManagement to setup a network of 10,000 psychiatrists, psychologists andsocial workers, as well as hospitals and other treatmentcenters, to serve IBM's 700,000 U.S. employees, retirees anddependents.</LP><TEXT>   The move to separate mental health and substance abusebenefits from other health benefits reflects an emergingtrend among companies that have found psychiatric costsparticularly troublesome in the battle to contain overallhealth costs.   IBM is the latest company to arrange for a network ofpreferred health care providers and encourage employeesthrough financial incentives to use them. The networks areintended to enable companies to manage better theiremployees' use of health services and to obtain discountsfrom doctors and hospitals in return for a designated flow ofpatients. Last week, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.announced the establishment of a system of networks coveringall health care for its U.S. work force.   More and more companies say that &quot;the only way we arereally going to be able to offer health benefits is if wemanage them well,&quot; said Veronica Vaccaro, manager of mentalhealth promotion at the Washington Business Group on Health.   Although terms of IBM's move into managed mental healthcare weren't disclosed, Ms. Vaccaro described it as &quot;thebiggest deal dollar-wise&quot; yet for a managed care vendor. &quot;Weexpect this will {continue to} happen as companies strugglewith ways to provide benefits and also manage their costs.&quot;   While overall health costs at IBM have increased at a 10%to 11% annual rate over the past few years, according to W.E.Burdick, senior vice president for personnel, mental healthand substance abuse costs have soared at a 20% rate. &quot;It'sthe single highest cost escalation area of all of our {healthbenefit} offerings,&quot; he said.   Among companies with 5,000 or more employees, mentalhealth and substance abuse costs soared 47% last year over1988, according to a survey by A. Foster Higgins andamp; Co., a NewYork benefits consultant.   That's one reason some companies have decided to breakmental health and substance abuse out of health benefitprograms. Those problems &quot;are dramatically different fromother acute care medical issues,&quot; said Daniel C. Smith,director of employee assistance and human risk managementresources at McDonnell Douglas Corp., which has developedinnovative mental health treatment programs. &quot;The treatmentof these conditions individually is far less predictable thanit is for acute health problems and there is so muchindividual variance in response to treatment. It doesn't makesense for us to try to make a square peg fit in a roundhole.&quot;   Still, says Foster Higgins, just 5% of all companies, and10% of companies with more than 10,000 employees, have set upseparate preferred provider networks to manage mental healthcosts.   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., coupled the change in itsmental health plan with other benefits revisions, includingnew programs for long-term care insurance and assistance withcatastrophic health problems such as spinal injuries, organtransplants, and premature births. Mr. Burdick said theoverall intent is to meet new benefits needs of employees inthese areas while cutting annual growth in costs to singledigits. IBM spends about $3,400 a year per employee on healthcare, or more than $750 million.   American PsychManagement, a unit of closely held ValueHealth Inc., Avon, Conn., was selected from more than a dozenvendors who bid on the contract, which Value Health said was&quot;in the tens of millions of dollars.&quot;   Moving to managed care is a &quot;big departure from IBM'sculture,&quot; said Bryan Lane, a principal with Towers Perrin, abenefit consultant that helped the company design the plan.Although participation in the network is voluntary, thecompany is recommending providers for its employees, breakingfrom past practice of completely free choice. But Mr. Burdicksaid many employees are eager for recommendations, especiallyfor mental health problems. He said response to the program,announced this week, is already positive.   The mental health plan, as well as other benefits changes,were designed after the company made numerous surveys of itswork force. That groundwork, as well as financial incentives,should help persuade employees to use it, the company says.   For instance, for those in the network, the company willpay 100% of inpatient hospitalization for an unlimited periodafter an annual deductible. For those seeking care outsidethe network, coverage drops to 80% of hospitalization for upto 90 days a year. For outpatient care, including visits withpsychiatrists, the plan pays 80% of expenses up to $15,000and then 50% up to $25,000; non-network reimbursement is 50%of expenses up to $25,000.   In addition, employees will be permitted to nominate theirown providers for the network, who would then have to fulfillcriteria specified by American PsychManagement. And officialsbelieve the sheer number of participants will make it easyfor employees to use the network.   As one of the nation's largest employers, IBM considersitself in the vanguard of employee benefits and says it haspioneered programs in such areas as prevention, child carenetworks and geriatric services. By its sheer size, IBM'swork force reflects a variety of health and social trends --ranging from substance abuse to care for elderly dependents-- that affect companies and their employees around thecountry. How it addresses such issues is of broad interestamong benefits officials and health policy makers, especiallyas companies seek successful cost-containment strategies.   For Value Health's unit, the IBM contract representsenormous growth. American PsychManagement has set up a unitdevoted exclusively to IBM that will have 100 employees, saidThomas J. Neville, the unit's chief operating officer. Theunit's current work force is 130.</TEXT></DOC>
