Students have been protesting the selection of Zinser, who isnot deaf and does not know sign language, and their demonstrationshave halted virtually all instruction for four days. They havepromised to continue their protests until she resigns.   They threatened to seize the president's campus house andoffice, if Zinser made her way past students blocking entrances tothe school.   Zinser's whereabouts Thursday could not be determined.University officials would not reveal at which hotel she wasstaying.   Student leader Greg Hlibok said students were willing to meetwith Zinser, but intend to tell her and Jane Bassett Spilman,chairwoman of the school's board of trustees, that ``there will beno dialogue, no compromise. That's what we're promising.''   ``We want her out, and we intend to tell her she isn't welcomehere, that she's not our president,'' Hlibok added.   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who is a member of Gallaudet's boardof trustees, said in a statement Thursday he suggested to Zinserthat in the next few days she consult with the faculty, students,staff and alumni ``to experience the passion with which they viewthe appointment of hearing president.''   ``The time is long overdue for Gallaudet University to have adeaf president,'' Bonior said. ``The university has for generationsbeen an international mecca for excellence and opportunity in deafeducation.   ``The question before us is _ How long will it be able tosustain this important role without a deaf president?   ``I hope Dr. Zinser and the board of trustees will be sensitiveto this urgent need as they begin to try to heal the wounds andmove forward to enhance the fine traditions of this institution.''   Earlier, in an interview with The Washington Post, Bonior saidhe told Zinser that federal aid for the school may be jeopardizedif she refuses to leave the post she was named to Sunday night.   About 75 percent of the school's $76 million operating budgetcomes from federal funds. The rest comes from tuition and grants.   Zinser, who left an administrative position at the University ofNorth Carolina at Greensboro to take the Gallaudet job, saidWednesday she was assuming her post immediately instead of waitinguntil the original July starting date.   She also lamented that campus protests have disrupted classes,and said she would take unspecified steps to restore order if theprotests, which have been peaceful so far, took a violent turn.   Besides calling for Zinser's ouster, the students want Spilman'sresignation, and a deaf majority on the 20-member trustees board,which now has four deaf members.   As Zinser attempted to start her job, support for the protestersgrew.   Late Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jacksonissued a statement supporting the students, and called onGallaudet's board of trustees to ``resolve this dispute equitably.   ``The problem is not that the students do not hear. The problemis that the hearing world does not listen,'' Jackson said.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., another Democratic presidentialhopeful, on Thursday called for Zinser's resignation.   Simon, a longtime member of the Senate Labor and Human Resourcessubcommittee on the handicapped, which has jurisdiction overfunding for Gallaudet, said Zinser's appointment was a ``slap inthe face to the entire purpose of the university.''   Vince Dollard, a spokesman for the National Technical Institutefor the Deaf, in Rochester, N.Y., said two buses and several cars,carrying at least 100 students from the school, were to leave atmidnight for Washington to join the Gallaudet protest.   A rally was being held on the Rochester campus in support ofGallaudet Thursday afternoon.   In addition, some East Coast leaders of the National Associationof the Deaf, a 20,000-member deaf rights group based in SilverSpring, Md., will gather in Washington on Friday, spokesman FredWeiner said.   And activist Abbie Hoffman, who lectures to universities onstudent protests, said, ``What's happening at Gallaudet isobviously right there in the front,'' he said, ``and they're goingto win their battle.''   He said he has urged members of three electronic bulletin-boardnetworks, with a total of 16,000 members, to support the students'efforts by tying up Gallaudet's switchboards with calls of supportfor the students.</TEXT></DOC>
