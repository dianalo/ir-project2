Instead, undercover UFCW organizers slipped into Smitty'sstores, videotaped alleged safety and child-labor lawviolations and gave the film to regulatory agencies and thepress. The resulting headlines and state fines haven't madeSmitty's buckle, but in the midst of that battle, anotherfood chain, Smith's Food andamp; Drug Centers Inc. of Salt LakeCity, Utah, voluntarily recognized the union at its Phoenixstores. &quot;The union was able to show us that they had signedup a majority of the people,&quot; says Peter Barth, a Smith'slawyer. &quot;We decided to go that way rather than go through aprotracted organizing and election process.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's done a lot in terms of making workers aware that weare still alive and well,&quot; UFCW organizer Joe Campos says oftactics such as those used against Smitty's. &quot;It's also madecompanies that would have otherwise done battle withorganized labor take a second look.&quot;   Battered by hard times, broken strikes and waning support,some unions are using regulatory laws as strategic weapons intheir organizing and bargaining battles. By exposingcompanies to penalties, damaging disclosures and expensivelegal wrangles, they aim to win converts and pressureemployers without risking strikes.   This aggressive new strategy has naturally raised hacklesamong employers. Nonunion companies contend that the tacticsare being used to harass them in the marketplace andblackmail them into voluntarily recognizing unions without aNational Labor Relations Board-sponsored election. Meanwhile,unionized companies complain that even maintaining aviolation-free workplace wouldn't prevent a union from filingcomplaints to a government agency and forcing management toexpend time and money defending itself. &quot;There is nothing youcan do to combat it,&quot; grumbles Peter Eide, manager of laborlaw for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. &quot;It's a gross abuse ofprocedure, but it's done.&quot;   Unfortunately for the labor movement, the strategy hasn'treversed its long decline. The percentage of U.S. workersrepresented by unions fell to 16% in 1990, down from 20% in1983, and some economists contend that, with major companieslaying off thousands of employees amid a gritty recession,unions' use of regulatory laws will have only a marginalimpact at best. &quot;What really counts is what's going on in theeconomy,&quot; says Leo Troy, a professor at the RutgersUniversity Institute of Industrial Relations. &quot;This otherstuff is all froth.&quot;   But for many companies, it has become costly froth. Lastyear, Rock Bottom Stores Inc., a New York pharmacy chain,paid $15,000 in state fines and $10,000 to a specialeducation fund after a child-labor investigation. The probehad been triggered by tips from a retail workers union thatwas concerned about losing full-time jobs to part-timeteen-agers. And complaints from the striking AmalgamatedTransit Union helped spur the Federal Highway Administrationto propose fines of up to $209,700 against Greyhound LinesInc. last month for, among other things, allowing replacementdrivers who had failed drug tests to operate buses. Thecompany is contesting some of the charges but has admitted toothers, including those involving the drivers and drug tests.   Although the fines involved aren't necessarily huge, suchregulatory action can be harmful to a company. Unions &quot;aretargeting particular kinds of firms that are particularlysensitive to these pressures,&quot; says Daniel J. Mitchell, aprofessor at the UCLA graduate school of management. &quot;If youare a supermarket, you don't want people to think that youhave unsanitary conditions in your food handling.&quot;   The regulatory strategy grew out of the so-called&quot;corporate campaigns&quot; begun in the 1970s, when theAmalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union besieged J.P.Stevens andamp; Co. with boycotts and public relations campaignsaimed at its directors, investors, shareholders andcustomers. The union won its organizing campaign against thetextile giant in 1980.   But despite some successes, union membership continuedplummeting in the 1980s as employers developed moresophisticated defenses and followed the lead of the Reaganadministration, which simply replaced striking air trafficcontrollers in 1981. Meanwhile, budget cuts gutted many ofthe regulatory agencies that had traditionally investigatedviolations of safety, child-labor and wage-and-hour laws,especially in nonunion shops.   Labor strategists say that void gave them both a reasonand an opportunity to sharpen the corporate campaigns andbegin probing for employers' internal soft spots. And whilethey had no legal powers, there was nothing to stop them frompublicizing the results of their own investigations andspurring undermanned regulatory agencies into action. &quot;It wasa way of escalating costs to the employer for bargaining inbad faith without incurring a strike,&quot; says Greg Tarpinian,executive director of the Labor Research Association.   Nebraska-based IBP Inc., once a strongly antiunionmeatpacker, was among the early targets. After a 1986 unionlockout and strike at its Dakota City, Neb., plant, the UFCWconducted a four-month review of IBP's accident and injuryreports and filed a complaint with the federal OccupationalSafety and Health Administration alleging that the companyhad not reported hundreds of injuries.   The result was a massive OSHA investigation, congressionalhearings at which IBP executives admitted to keeping two setsof injury records and a record $5.7 million federal fine thatwas later reduced to $975,000 after the company agreed toredesign dangerous jobs at its plants. Meanwhile, the companysettled the strike and allowed the UFCW to organize anotherplant. Last year in Dakota City, the two sides negotiatedtheir first contract in 21 years without a strike.   The success of such actions has spurred unions tointensify their efforts. In addition to using surveys andhome interviews to obtain their own members' knowledge ofpotential workplace problems, unions have made extensive useof the federal Freedom of Information Act to obtaincompanies' regulatory records. &quot;Unions have wanted copies ofour investigative reports in a wide range of industries,&quot;says Bill Belt, Dallas regional administrator of the LaborDepartment's wage and hour division. &quot;This is a flurry ofrequests in the last few months.&quot;   Meanwhile, some unions have moved beyond core workplaceissues into public safety, pollution and broader regulatoryconcerns. In 1989, German chemical giant BASF Corp. ended afive-year union lockout at its Geismar, La., plant after theOil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union helped organizeenvironmental opposition groups, filed environmentalobjections to the company's area expansion plans in Louisianaand tried to link BASF to chemical waste sites in severalstates. The union argues that such tactics were pivotal,although John Kirkman, BASF director of industrial relations,says they had little impact, adding that, &quot;it was always ourintention to bargain in good faith and get a settlement.&quot;   In some cases, regulatory attacks have been followed byunion defeats. Nordstrom Inc. employees voted out the UFCWdespite its charges about unpaid overtime at theSeattle-based retailer, and Eastern Airlines mechanics'allegations to the Federal Aviation Administration aboutfalsified maintenance reports only hastened the air carrier'sdemise.   But labor leaders contend that, even amid such defeats,correcting dangerous workplace conditions and helping workerswin back pay in wage-and-hour cases promote the perceptionthat a union can still have a concrete impact on theworkplace. &quot;You have to go after this problem,&quot; says MarshallGarcia, executive vice president of a Retail, Wholesale andDepartment Store Union local in New York. &quot;For the unions,its a matter of survival.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
