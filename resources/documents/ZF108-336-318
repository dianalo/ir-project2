(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The second wave has begun.andP;  It's time to network the networks.andM;First came the influx of personal computers.andP;  End-user departments, in manycases, bought them without telling MIS or anyone else.andP;  They came in the backdoor, sometimes disguised for budget purposes as typewriters, word processorsand calculators.andM;By the time management knew what was happening, many organizations had dozensor even hundreds of PCs, acquired by many different managers from manydifferent vendors.andM;Nobody could say these were useless.andP;  Individually, they were useful for wordprocessing, spreadsheets, simple database management and assorted otherchores.andP;  But it has become increasingly obvious that the potential goesbeyond that and the PCs should be connected.andM;So they have been.andP;  Canadian businesses bought about 7,750 local-areanetworks last year according to Evans Research Corp. of Toronto.andP;  This year,the figure should approach 11,000.andP;  The spread of LANs is expected tocontinue, with the market growing 35 to 45 per cent annually through theearly 1990s.andP;  But it seems this is only the beginning.andM;Like the PCs they connect, many of those LANs have been acquired byindividual departments, with little or no corporate MIS involvement.andP;  KeithEverett, director of computer industry analysis at Venture Development Corp.andO;in Natick, Mass., says many LAN buying decisions are still made at thedepartmental level.andM;So organizations have traded their assortments of isolated, incompatible PCsfor assortments of isolated, incompatible LANs.andM;&quot;There are very often islands of communication,&quot; says Jayshree Ullal,internetworking product line manager at Ungermann-Bass Inc., in Santa Clara,Calif.andM;This is not always true.andP;  Networking is older than business personalcomputing, and some outfits started using LANs with minicomputers andmainframes in the late 1970s and early 1980s.andP;  Where LANs originated as linksfor larger systems, they tend to have been purchased by central dataprocessing or MIS people.andP;  This produces more cohesive organization-widenetwork strategies.andM;The Vancouver General Hospital, for instance, has a range of hardware fromPCs through minicomputers to mainframes attached to a large Ethernetlocal-area network.andP;  The network is centrally planned and administered.andM;Kodak Canada Inc. in Toronto also has an extensive Ethernet, but the companyhas implemented IBM Token Ring in its administrative offices.andP;  Making the twowork together wasn't trivial, says Brad Edgar, manager of telecommunications,but work together they do.andP;  &quot;Our goal,&quot; Edgar says, &quot;is that it'll be totallytransparent to the end-user.&quot;andM;More often, though, LANs have developed from the bottom up.andP;  Great-West LifeAssurance Co. of Winnipeg has more than 30 local-area networks atheadquarters and branch offices.andP;  Ranging in size from four or five nodes tomore than 30, some are connected back to the head office mainframe, whileothers are unconnected.andP;  Great-West is now installing a backbone networkusing IBM Token Ring, to tie all its LANs together.andM;The reason for the backbone is simply that communications needs transcendsingle departments, says Sheila Fortier, senior telecommunications specialistat Great-West.andM;&quot;Different departments work closely together,&quot; she says, &quot;and they're notalways located on the same floor in the building.&quot;andM;So now, companies are faced with building bridges between those islands.andO;&quot;We're getting into bigger and bigger networks,&quot; says Philipp Schumacher,general manager of Drake Network Systems.andP;  As a result, a hot issue is makingdifferent LAN hardware and operating systems work together.andM;In the LAN operating system arena, major players are vying to increase theirsupport for multiple systems.andP;  One issue is support for both IBM-compatibleand Apple Macintosh PCs.andP;  The market-leading Novell NetWare  supports both.andO;3Com Corp. plans a Macintosh version of its 3+Open software this year, andBanyan Systems Inc. plans a Macintosh version of its VINES operating systemby mid-1990.andM;&quot;Networking vendors must become multi-vendor,&quot; says Elaine Tappert-Hanson,general manager of 3Com Canada Inc. &quot;The world is not all blue.andP;  The world isnot all 3Com.&quot;andM;Another concern is operating systems that bring PCs and larger systemstogether.andP;  &quot;You're still going to have your big databases up on the host,&quot;says Fortier at Great-West Life, &quot;so now the problem is, how can you attachyour PCs to the mainframe?&quot;andM;The OS/2 LAN Manager, jointly developed by Microsoft Corp. and 3Com, aims todo this with versions for Unix systems and Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  Vax minisas well as IBM hardware.andM;&quot;Its single goal in life,&quot; Hanson says, is to integrate micros, minis andmainframes.andP;  3Com's 3+Open operating system is based on LAN Manager, as aresoftware products from a number of other vendors.andM;Due both to the linking together of existing LANs and to simple extension ofexisting networks, the average LAN is getting bigger.andP;  Everett says theaverage number of machines attached to each network was between eight and 10last year.andP;  He expects it may be about 15 by 1992.andM;This puts the spotlight on an increasingly critical area: network management.andO;The bigger the networks become, the more vital are tools to manage andtroubleshoot them.andM;This will not be the only area to watch.andP;  Backbones -- the trunks that tietogether separate floors or buildings into corporate LANs -- are sproutingup.andP;  Carrying traffic throughout the organization sometimes calls forcapacity and speed PC-LAN technology can't deliver.andM;That puts the spotlight on high-speed, high-capacity networking.andP;  The10-megabit-per-second Ethernet and the newer 16-Mbps version of IBM TokenRing could benefit from that concern, but the real winner, by the mid 1990s,is likely to be the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), an emergingstandard for local-area networks running on optical fibre.andP;  FDDI will allowspeeds up to 100 megabits per second -- 10 times that of Ethernet.andM;The rise of fibre, along with advances in twisted pair, mean the coaxialcable that was once the staple of local-area networking is fading from thescene.andP;  Claims are now made that twisted pair handles speeds up to 16megabits per second, the fastest available with any LAN standard other thanFDDI.andM;Ken Ryder, vice-president of operations at Markham, Ont.andP;  LAN cabling companySymtech Canada Inc., advises taking figures based on tests in ideallaboratory conditions with a grain of salt.andP;  Nonetheless, he says, twistedpair is elbowing coax to the sidelines.andM;Whichever technologies attain widespread use, the average network will bemore and more likely to incorporate several of them.andP;  Simple, single-vendorLANs will increasingly merge into more complicated structures, creating morenetwork management problems, more need for interoperability and more benefitsfor users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
