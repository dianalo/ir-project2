The Customs Service in Washington and the U.S. attorney in Greensboro, N.C., have launched a criminal investigation to determine whether R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. provided U.S. officials with false results on herbicide tests, or other deceptive information involving hundreds of tons of tobacco imported from Pakistan or other countries for processing in the U.S., according to law enforcement officials and government documents. A federal grand jury is expected to start hearing evidence in the case soon, officials said.    The investigation could create political problems for Tokyo, which yielded to U.S. pressure only last year to lift longstanding tariffs that blocked foreign-made tobacco products from competing in Japan. The controversy also threatens to damage major marketing efforts by Reynolds and other U.S. companies trying to gain a foothold in that market.    Law enforcement officials said the company has informed them that none of the tainted tobacco or cigarettes were intended for use, or have been sold in the U.S. Reynolds said the tobacco was intended for use only in Winston Lights cigarettes intended for the Japanese market.    In Winston-Salem, N.C., a Reynolds spokesman confirmed that the company shipped into the U.S. tobacco that had been treated with herbicides at levels exceeding federal standards, but he said that the tobacco doesn't pose any health threat.    In response to questions, the company spokesman declined to comment on allegations by federal investigators that some Reynolds officials were aware the tobacco contained higher-than-permitted traces of such chemicals, and may have knowingly provided false or misleading information to U.S. regulators. Reynolds declined to provide additional details because the investigation is continuing.    Federal prosecutors and customs officials have seized more than 354,000 pounds of unprocessed tobacco believed to contain as much as five times the legal U.S. limit for the herbicide Dicamba, law enforcement officials and government documents indicate.    Moreover, investigators and the company believe that as many as 160 million cigarettes previously shipped to Japan may be contaminated by the same herbicide, and nearly 46,000 packs already have been distributed to employees and retailers as part of a promotional effort there.    Reynolds said the remaining cigarettes won't be sold or distributed.    Spokesmen for the Justice Department and Customs Service declined to comment. Japanese embassy officials in Washington couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    Japanese regulators have told U.S. officials that since Japan doesn't have standards for allowable traces of Dicamba in tobacco products, the shipments don't appear to violate Japanese law.    But given the Japanese government's &quot;sensitivities&quot; about the issue and &quot;the potential for a 'health scare' that could spread to other U.S. cigarette manufacturers,&quot; Japanese officials have urged the U.S. to keep details of the investigation quiet, according to a copy of confidential cable believed to have been sent last month by Mike Mansfield, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, to Secretary of State George Shultz . &quot;In this way,&quot; the copy of the cable said, &quot;the Japanese press would be less likely to learn of this incident.&quot;    Congressional investigators, however, are expected to request information about the probe from State and Justice Department officials. The staff of a House Energy subcommittee on health and its chairman, Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), are expected to look into the matter. Japanese government officials have started their own investigation.    Last month, Mr. Shultz told Ambassador Mansfield that the U.S. was &quot;particularly concerned for public health reasons&quot; about cigarettes already distributed in Japan, and urged that remaining shipments &quot;be located and inspected as soon as possible,&quot; according to a copy of a cable believed to have been sent to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.    After further discussions, Mr. Mansfield replied that several Japanese ministries &quot;expressed their concern about possible repercussions&quot; stemming from the investigation, according to a copy of the embassy's response apparently sent to Washington May 22. &quot;A grand jury and possible criminal and civil prosecution may be initiated shortly,&quot; Mr. Mansfield said, according to the copy.    Reynolds has told federal prosecutors that it will cooperate with investigators. A spokesman said the company was informed by federal officials in February that a shipment of tobacco from the company's West German subsidiary exceeded the maximum 0.5 parts-per-million limit for traces of Dicamba allowed on certain kinds of imported tobacco.    A Reynolds spokesman said the chemical, used to control weeds and as a tobacco-ripening agent, isn't allowed to be used at all on domestically grown tobacco.    After conducting its own tests, the company said, it determined that several other shipments also exceeded the same limit. The company said the seizures won't have any noticeable effect on the company's finances because they are &quot;a very small amount of our tobacco inventory.&quot;    ---   Betsy Morris contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
