The treaty, banning all U.S. and Soviet intermediate-rangemissiles, is not expected to come to the Senate floor until May 9at the earliest, leaving only 2{ weeks for debate before Reaganleaves for Moscow.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we're veryconcerned'' the treaty might not be approved in time. ``I think itwould be most unfortunate'' if that happened, he said.   Fitzwater said ratification of the Intermediate-range NuclearForces, or INF, treaty would have an effect on negotiations to curbthe deadliest class of nuclear weapons _ strategic arms.   To have the INF treaty signed before the summit ``would be animportant boost to our negotiations'' on strategic weapons, thespokesman said.   ``Similarly, if it's not signed, it would tend to dampen, Ithink, the prospects for serious ... progress'' on a strategicweapons treaty, he added. ``It would not be helpful and we wouldhope that the Congress would be able to ratify it before we go.''   Even if the INF treaty is ratified, administration officialsdoubt that a strategic arms agreement will be ready for signing atthe summit.   After a three-night rest stop in Helsinki, Finland, Reagan willarrive in Moscow on May 29 for his fourth meeting with Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   The two leaders will see each on each of the five days Reagan isin Moscow. The president also will have separate schedule of hisown.   For example, he will hold a meeting with Soviet writers, artistsand film makers, visit a monastery and also confer with Sovietrefuseniks _ Jews denied permission to emigrate.   White House planners expect that a highlight will be apresidential address to Soviet students, followed by aquestion-and-answer session with the audience. The event isexpected to be broadcast on live television in the United States.   Reagan also plans to end the visit with a news conference.   ``The INF ratification is important for what it says about theUnited States' commitment to arms control and therefore helpingmake progress in the START (strategic arms reduction) talks,''Fitzwater said.   ``All of our discussions with the Congress had indicated thatthey would be able to ratify the treaty before we go to Moscow,''Fitzwater said. ``That has been our expectation ... We still thinkthat is possible and we hope that the Congress will stick to thatschedule.''   The latest snag in the ratification process is the question ofwhether the treaty bans futuristic weapons such as lasers, particlebeams and other devices, as well as existing weapons.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, in a letter toSecretary of State George P. Shultz, said the Soviets agree withthe United States that the treaty bans futuristic weapons.   The treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300 to3,400 miles, but some senators have questioned how the pact wouldaffect weapons in that range that could be developed in the future.   Once the treaty is on the Senate floor, the agreement likelywill encounter stalling tactics from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., andother foes.</TEXT></DOC>
