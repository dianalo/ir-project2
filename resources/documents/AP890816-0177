(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Keepers at Brookfield Zoo have beendonning gorilla suits and expertly aping simian behavior in aneffort to succor a couple of abused gorilla infants.   The zoo's gorilla family has been in a turmoil since the reigningsilverback male, Samson, died in March 1988, leaving the clanleaderless. His offspring, Kwizera, a 16-month-old female, andKwisha, a male about the same age, were injured when they wereinfants, then rejected by their mothers.   As a result, keepers at the zoo southwest of Chicago were giventhe job of putting on a gorilla suit and spending countless hoursacting as surrogate mothers to the battered infants.   ``Zoo policy is to leave all babies with their mothers _ to lettheir mothers raise them,'' said Dr. Anne Baker, the zoo's curatorof primates.   ``The past three months, we've been trying to reintroduce our twoinfant gorillas to their moms, after we had to take the babies awayfor their own safety,'' said Ms. Baker.   While abuse of the young is not ordinarily a problem in gorillasociety, Kwisha got a broken arm in a tug of war between his motherand a childless female gorilla who tried to steal the infant.   After a veterinary surgeon fixed the arm, the keepers tried togive Kwisha back to his mother.   ``She picked him up, then put him back down and no longer wouldtouch him,'' said Ms. Baker. ``We kept trying, but she wouldn't pickhim up.''   ``She wasn't aggressive toward him. I suspect her refusal hadsomething to do with his inability to cling. His one arm wasfunctionless, and gorilla infants stay with their mothers by holdingon very tightly to that fur.''   With Kwisha abandoned, the zoo staff had no choice but to raisethe infant.   Kwizera's story was a little different. She was injured somehow,perhaps by her mother, Babs, rolling over on her while sleeping, andsustained some slight brain damage.   The youngster acted neurotic, sitting with her arms clenched toher chest and her thumbs held tightly in her fists.   ``And every time her mother touched her, Kwizera screamed,'' saidMs. Baker.   Kwizera was taken from her mom and treated for a fever.   About a week later she was given back to Babs, who then ignoredher.   Kwizera persisted in trying to cuddle up, but Babs finally had itand wheeled about and bit her daughter on the face and rump.   Suddenly the the zoo had two baby gorillas they had to raise. Onekeeper suggested buying stuffed gorillas and putting them with thebabies. This idea evolved into the gorilla suit.   ``We weren't sure what they'd learn from all this,'' Ms. Bakersaid. ``But we wanted them to get used to the idea of something verylarge, black and hairy.''   Little by little, however, the young gorillas seem to beimproving and gaining acceptance back with the clan.   Last week, Kwisha spent his first night alone with his mom. Andthen a few days ago, Kwizera felt brave enough to walk into hermother's cage, the keepers nervously standing by with fire hoses incase Babs attacked her daughter again.   But all went well, and the next day Kwizera was seen riding onher mother's back.</TEXT></DOC>
