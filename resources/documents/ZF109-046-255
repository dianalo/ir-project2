(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Coats, Pamela K.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>This application paper shows how bankers who are planning tooperate a local electronic funds transfer (EFT) network can usesimulation and an expert system to improve their EFT decisions.andO;The key to making good EFT decisions is understanding thetradeoffs between the costs and performance of different networkpossibilities.andP;  Being able to explore choices in light of a bank'sservice and profit goals, prior to the actual commitment ofresources, is essential to that understanding.andP;  However, there areno published EFT studies which attempt to combine both technicaland economic concerns, particularly the representation ofintangible benefits and costs, in a single methodology.andP;  Thesimulation process described here illustrates a computer modelthat approximates the performance and economics of alternativelocal EFT designs.andP;  Expert system technology is incorporated togive bankers the convenience of interacting with the model in anatural language format.andP;  It should be noted that the networkdescribed here is based on the author's current research andongoing model development for client banks.andP;  Every attempt is madeto be as informative as possible without breachingconfidentiality.andP;  (Reprinted by permission of the publisher.)andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Expert SystemsDiscrete SimulationEFTSDecision Support SystemsPerformance-Cost RelationshipBankingModeling of Computer SystemsTechnology.andO;Feature:   illustrationcharttable.andO;Caption:   Economic input and output factors.
