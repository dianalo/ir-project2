Unexpectedly strong growth in West Germany and France,fired by extraordinarily large investment by corporations, ishelping politicians mold once sacrosanct national policiesinto pan-European consensus. Seemingly unachievable goalssuch as the unification of Germany and the rebuilding ofEastern Europe are being achieved, fueling a strong sense ofoptimism.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Before the end of the century there will be a singlecurrency in Europe,&quot; Cornelis van der Klugt, former chairmanof N.V. Philips of Holland, recently told a lecture halljammed with business students in St. Gallen, Switzerland.&quot;Much of Eastern Europe will be in the EC,&quot; he continued,&quot;and 20 years from now there will be a Europe of 700 millionpeople able to be equal partners with the U.S., Japan and therest of the world.&quot;   Evidence of much greater political confidence abounds,too. The formerly fractious European Community reactedimmediately and unanimously to the recent repression ofdissent in Romania by cutting off all but humanitarian aid.So successful has been the EC-led effort to coordinate helpto Poland and Hungary that the EC may be asked by otherindustrialized nations to lead a similar aid program to theSoviet Union, and maybe also Latin America and the Caribbean.   European politicians are crowing. &quot;Europe is no longer insearch of its identity,&quot; says French Prime Minister MichelRocard. &quot;It is now the fulcrum of international relations.&quot;Says EC Commission vice president Henning Christophersen:&quot;Europe is now the pole of attraction for the whole world.&quot;Adds Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of the Paris-basedOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development: &quot;Thereis a dynamism for development in Europe with less {perceived}risk than in the United States.&quot;   Fears that the collapse of physical barriers to EasternEurope would derail Western Europe's effort to remove itsinternal trade barriers have proved groundless. WesternEuropean integration is both accelerating and spreading.Fears that a united Germany would dominate Europe militarilyand economically are giving way to confidence that Germanywill be the engine driving a fast-growing Europe.   Worries about global recession are absent here. UnlikeJapan, Europe has a big and growing home market. Unlike theU.S., it has neither a budget deficit nor a savings-and-loancrisis.   Business is betting on a decade of European prosperity.Volkswagen, which already owns the Spanish auto maker SEAT,has announced plans to build 250,000 cars a year in EastGermany. Coca-Cola, which recently built a new bottling plantin Dunkirk, France, also plans to invest $140 million in EastGermany. PepsiCo will spend more than $1 billion on a tradedeal with the Soviet Union.   General Electric of the U.S. bought just over half ofHungarian lightbulb maker Tungsram for $150 million, at thesame time as it is developing several West European jointventures to make turbines and household appliances. Sony isplanning a fourth stereo equipment factory in France. PhilipMorris just plunged into the cutthroat European food businessby agreeing to buy 80% of Swiss coffee and chocolate producerJacobs Suchard for $3.8 billion.   Mergers involving Europe's 1,000 biggest companies havenearly quadrupled in the past five years. Last year, therewere more than 400. European investment in the U.S. reachedmore than $250 billion in assets at the end of last year; itis greater in dollar volume yet less politically sensitivethan Japanese investment.   French groups have been particularly hungry. Recently,Rhone-Poulenc bought Rorer Group, a pharmaceuticals maker.Groupe Michelin bought Uniroyal Goodrich to become theworld's biggest tire maker. Pechiney bought American NationalCan Co. to become the world's biggest can maker, and Hachettebought two publishing concerns, Grolier and DiamandisCommunications, in separate transactions totaling more than$1 billion.   But Europe's renaissance will cause problems, too --especially for the U.S. Hans-Joerg Rudloff, chairman ofCredit Suisse First Boston Ltd., says that current tightcredit conditions will tighten further for Latin America andthe U.S. &quot;Capital will go to the countries that show thehighest growth potential for the next five to 10 years;that's Eastern Europe, not South America,&quot; he says. &quot;Themarket will force the U.S. to earn the money it imports. Themarket won't any longer finance U.S. fiscal and monetaryindiscipline.&quot;   Fast economic and political integration of the EC's 12countries could also unbalance the organization. West Germanyrepresents about 30% of the EC's gross national product; theunited Germany would represent about 35%. In contrast, Francehas about 20%, and Italy and the United Kingdom each haveabout 12%. Yet these four countries have the same votingpower within EC institutions; they also have the same numberof members of the European Parliament, and the same number ofEC Commissioners.   &quot;Will the system still work as well?&quot; wonders formerFrench president Valery Giscard d'Estaing. &quot;It's not amilitary fear of invasion, but we do need to handle thisshift in power within the EC.&quot; To avoid internal friction,says Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, the Germans mustn't push for moreEC voting power right away.   A more general worry is that outside events, such as aviolent break-up of the Soviet Union or clashes betweennationalist groups in Eastern Europe, could quickly deflatecorporate and political confidence in Europe. But short of acataclysm, it seems assured that intra-European trade willbecome easier and the production of goods and servicescheaper. This would make European companies more competitiveworld-wide, and also make it more profitable for U.S. andJapanese companies to do business here.   Germany is the first target for investment. &quot;We have tostrengthen the position of all our companies in Germany,&quot;says Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Ing. C. Olivetti and ofCOFIDE, an industrial holding company. Olivetti already ownsTriumph-Adler, a West German office machines company, andCOFIDE's Valeo unit recently bought two German auto partsmakers. &quot;Germany is the place where things will happen,&quot; Mr.De Benedetti says. &quot;Germany will be the center of industrialpower in Europe.&quot;   A Germany growing at 4% a year or more -- an estimate manyeconomists think is conservative -- will pull the rest ofEurope up along with it, and increase Europe's global reach.&quot;To have a European strategy is to have a global strategy,&quot;says Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman of Matra SA, the defensecontractor. Matra has deepening links with Germany throughone current and two planned joint ventures with Daimler-Benz,the aerospace and automotive conglomerate, which owns a smallamount of Matra's shares.   Joergen Rasmussen, whose family owns Rasmussen GmbH, amaker of industrial hose clamps in Maintal, near Frankfurt,runs his plant round the clock and still can't keep up withdemand. &quot;Germany is absolutely booming,&quot; he says, showing avisitor around the spotless, computer-controlled shippingroom, where robot arms move soundlessly up, down and across agrid of shelves, pluck out shiny clamps and put them on aconveyor belt. They are ready to be shipped, all withouthuman intervention. This system has allowed the company todouble sales in the past three years, he says. Rasmussen,like hundreds of other West German companies, has signed aletter of intent to buy an East German company. Rasmussenhopes the acquisition of a parts maker will increase sales inthe East and add more production capacity cheaply.   But investments tend to be different in Eastern Europe,the continent's Appalachia. Dresdner Bank, along with otherbig German banks, is rapidly opening dozens of branches inEast Germany to help soak up the mark windfall generated bymonetary union. Its effort required ingenuity as well ascapital: Dresdner rented a satellite telephone channel andgave each of its new branches a receiving dish and newtelephones, thus establishing reliable communications withouthaving to wait for East Germany's antiquated phone system tobe rebuilt.   Still, with the political and business climate unsettledin Eastern Europe, most of the action remains in the West.Big European companies are getting bigger by buying American,by buying each other, and spreading their wings.   Grand Metropolitan PLC, for example, last year boughtPillsbury of the U.S. and is now embarking on the conquest ofthe continental sweet tooth. Ove Sorensen, president of theHaagen-Dazs unit Grand Met acquired in the deal, sits in acorner of Paris's first Haagen-Dazs shop, not far from theArc de Triomphe. Around him Parisians sample the delights ofvanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered almonds, or pralinesand caramel at a pricey nine francs a scoop. Business isbrisk, but Mr. Sorensen's eyes are on Europe's grocery trade.He already has gotten his ice cream into 100 Paris groceriesand frozen-food outlets, and into Harrod's department storein London.   Pillsbury had put 13 Haagen-Dazs stores in West Germanythree years ago, but Grand Met's appetite is much bigger. Anew shop opened last week in London's Leicester Square, andmore are planned soon in Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria,Scandinavia and the Benelux countries.   The political background to this economic optimism is anunexpected detente between two factions within the EC, the&quot;deepeners&quot; and the &quot;broadeners.&quot; This seemingly arcanepolitical debate has real economic consequences. For the&quot;deepeners,&quot; led by France, Europe's future depends on evertighter links between the 12 current EC members, including asingle European currency and a European government. This,they argue, would tie Germany permanently into the WesternEuropean economic system. For the &quot;broadeners,&quot; led by GreatBritain, Europe's future depends on bringing Scandinavia,Switzerland and Eastern Europe into a loose federation ofsovereign states, where national parliaments remain supreme.   Suddenly it seems both sides are right. &quot;Widening anddeepening will occur simultaneously,&quot; says UK deputy primeminister Sir Geoffrey Howe.   This is happening because of a fortuitous combination ofeconomic good times and political guile. The Berlin Wallcollapsed during a boom in Western Europe, and well after theprogram to dismantle trade barriers by 1992 was under way.Rebuilding Eastern Europe is apt to mean slightly higherinflation in Germany, but an annual growth rate at or above4%. European politicians -- whatever their personalreservations -- have welcomed the unification of Germany inorder to embed it in a more-unified EC.   The psychological success of the EC's 1992 plan has ledthe deepeners to plunge ahead with plans to create a Europeancentral bank system and a single European currency. Whilefinal decisions won't be made before a treaty-writingconference in December, already the EC Commission has adetailed blueprint for a linked central bank system, to becalled EuroFed. Even the British, long holdouts againsteconomic and monetary union, have proposed a plan for acommon, though not obligatory, European currency.   The deepeners are now pushing political union as a way tocope with the startling change in Eastern Europe. This couldeventually lead to a much more genuine political federationthat would allow pan-European control over things such asdefense and security that now are solely national concerns.These changes won't be made final until a separatetreaty-writing conference meets alongside the economic one.But ideas include establishing a powerful European Senate ofgovernment officials from each member, to approve Europe-widelegislation; strengthening the role of the existing electedEuropean Parliament; giving the EC's executive Commissionmore of a political role; or all of these at once.   The broadeners are getting their way, too. Many otherEuropean countries, scared they will be denied full access tothe EC, now want in. The current EC -- Germany, France,Britain, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark,Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal -- won't accept newmembers till the 1992 program is fully operating. But it isnegotiating a liberal free-trade treaty with members of theEuropean Free Trade Association (Sweden, Norway, Finland,Iceland, Austria and Switzerland) to create a &quot;EuropeanEconomic Space&quot; encompassing 18 countries with 360 millionpeople.   The EC is also negotiating trade agreements with Poland,Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. Both the EFTA andEastern European agreements could eventually lead to full ECmembership for these countries. Turkey, Malta and Cyprus alsowant in, and Austria has applied to join separately fromEFTA.   EC officials, who had crossed their fingers hopefully whenpredicting that the 1992 plan would raise growth by 5%, haveuncrossed them and revised their forecasts to at least 7%.Even before the developments in Eastern Europe, capitalinvestment in the EC soared by 9% in 1988, more than doublewhat was forecast, and investment has stayed robust sincethen.   German economist Herbert Giersch, who was among the firstto describe the &quot;Eurosclerosis&quot; of the late 1970s, is now onthe high-growth bandwagon. &quot;This is not a sham prosperity,&quot;he says. &quot;It is based on modest wage growth and higherinvestment going into productive capacity. The long-termupswing should last well into the next millennium.&quot;   ---                     Rich Man, Poor Man                                                                                                                    Real GNP per capita; converted at           Purchasing power parities, 1987 data   Portugal .......... $ 6,297   Greece ............ $ 6,363   Ireland ........... $ 7,541   Spain ............. $ 8,681   Austria ........... $11,664   Belgium ........... $11,802   Netherlands ....... $12,252   Italy ............. $12,254   Britain ........... $12,340   France ............ $12,803   Finland ........... $12,838   Japan ............. $13,182   West Germany ...... $13,323   Denmark ........... $13,329   Sweden ............ $13,771   Luxemborg ......... $14,705   Norway ............ $15,405   Iceland ........... $15,508   Switzerland ....... $15,842   Canada ............ $17,211   United States ..... $18,338</TEXT></DOC>
