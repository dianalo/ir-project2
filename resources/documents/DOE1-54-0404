In all the samples studied we observelarge variations in the energy gap. We observe a very sharp gap in allthe samples with 2{Delta} = 5 meV yielding a value of 2{Delta}/k/subB/T/sub c/ = 0.7, far below the weak-coupling limit. The largest gapwe measure has a value of 2{Delta} = 95 meV and indicates an extremelystrong coupling value of 2{Delta}/k/sub B/T/sub c/ = 13. The large gapmay be due to tunneling between a series of superconducting regions withinthe sample. This possibility and other results are discussed in termsof tunneling into a glassy superconductor.</TEXT></DOC>
