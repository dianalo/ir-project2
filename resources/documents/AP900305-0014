GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A passing generation still talksabout the golden times in Prague when headwaiters shaved twice aday, coffee houses resounded with freewheeling debate and thepastries were more delectable than those in Vienna.   If you want glimpses of what once was along with the proletarianoverlay of recent decades _ and an absence of the West's trendiness_ come some evening to the Cafe Europa.   A trio of elderly men plays Hapsburg Empire melodies while apair of prostitutes eye new arrivals, homosexuals in leatherjackets embrace and a scruffy man hops through the room on one leg,clutching his crutches.   Paintings of semi-nude goddesses, florid mirrors and cut crystalchandeliers _ hallmarks of the art nouveau style _ adorn thepremises.   This popular haunt, located in the Grand Hotel Europa, datesback to the turn-of-the-century, when the Czechs were part of theAustro-Hungarian Empire and the coffee houses of Vienna, Prague andBudapest centers of social and political life.   Their heyday continued for 30 years of independence, knownnostalgically as the ``Golden Republic'', which many Czechs todayhope will serve as a model for the future.   ``Prague's coffee houses! Their pale remnants can no longerevoke the cafe life between the two World Wars,'' wrote Czech poetJaroslav Seifert of this era. ``In the coffee houses we discussed,planned and engaged in passionate polemics, and I never had thefeeling of time being wasted.''   There were cafes, wrote the 1984 Nobel Prize winner, frequentedby artists; others by high society ``where the headwaiters hadthemselves shaved twice a day,'' and places which attractedstudents because they carried current newspapers from all overEurope.   These vanished with the advent of Communism rule in 1948. Butstudents and dissidents, like the country's new president VaclavHavel and author Ludvik Vaculik, continued to gather although talkwas more circumspect _ and hushed.   In ``A Cup of Coffee with my Interrogator,'' Vaculik wrote thatit was suspected some tables in every cafe were bugged by theauthorities.   ``Do you really think that without coffee houses there wouldhave been no culture? '' Vaculik asks a friend in the book.   ``No, of course culture wasn't created there but it was anenvironment that encouraged it,'' the friend replies.   These days cafe talk is once again openly freewheeling and whilethe snooping devices may have been dismantled, the placesthemselves have yet to slough off the outer shabbiness and aroughness of manner to which Communist societies everywhere seemprone.   The Cafe Slavia, one of the last of the great old coffee houses,still attracts artists from the nearby opera and theater, butfilthy rags and cigarette butts lie unswept by slouching waiters.   The future of Prague's coffee houses, like many institutions inthe dramatically changing society, seems to hang in the balance.   Will the country's leaders and leading actresses once again bemercilessly dissected over coffee and cake? Will the onetime senseof stylishness return with an improving economy? Will the coffeehouses succumb to upmarket chic, catering more to tourists thanlocal characters?   Meanwhile at the Cafe Europa, matrons sip coffee topped withwhipped cream for 10 crowns (25 cents) and earnest young men downgood Czech white wine for 18 crowns a glass. The three gray-haired,bespectacled men could stand a neater fit to their suits and bettertuning of their instruments.   During a break, a West German businessman buys the trio beersand in a booming voice offers a lecture about all the changes theyare to expect when capitalistic ways take hold.   They nod politely, go back to violin, viola and piano and aftertheir Strauss and Lehar staples, venture into Broadway tunes and``As Time Goes By.''</TEXT></DOC>
