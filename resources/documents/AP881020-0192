Such crops ``will save the farmer money, and give the farmer theability to spray less herbicide and use an environmentally safeherbicide,'' said David M. Stalker, author of a study published inFriday's issue of the journal Science.   Stalker and other molecular biologists at Calgene said theysuccessfully removed a gene, or hereditary instruction, from soilbacteria and inserted it into tobacco plants. The gene makes theplants produce an enzyme that destroys the biodegradable herbicidebromoxynil, said Roger Salquist, Calgene's president and chiefexecutive officer.   The plants survived without damage when sprayed with eight timesthe dose of bromoxynil that normally kills them, said the study byStalker, Kevin McBride and Lorraine Malyj.   Calgene scientists also engineered tomato and cotton plants toresist the weed-killer, Salquist said.   Bromoxynil-resistant crops should let growers reduce theirchemical costs because bromoxynil belongs to a new class ofweed-killers that are used in relatively low doses and don'tpersist in the environment, said Salquist, Stalker and Jodie S.Holt, a plant physiologist at the University of California,Riverside.   ``Those are chemicals we want to keep on the market, as opposedto using older, more toxic and more persistent chemicals,'' Holtsaid.   ``Something that would allow use of this new generation of saferherbicides is important,'' said Medley, the USDA's director ofbiotechnology and environmental coordination. ``The benefit tosociety, not just to the farmer, can be great.''   Salquist said bromoxynil now is used only to kill weeds infields of crops that resist it naturally, including corn, wheat andbarley.   Calgene's study was funded by Rhone Poulenc Agrochemie, theFrench firm that sells bromoxynil under the name Buctril. Salquistsaid Calgene and the French company obviously want to make moneyselling seeds for Buctril-resistant crops and Buctril itself, butfarmers and the environment also will benefit.   Some genetically engineered plants produce fewer seeds. ButSalquist said field tests of Calgene's altered tomatoes showed nodamage to their yields.   Genetically engineered crops tolerate bromoxynil well, so theyshould have higher yields than natural crops that are sprayed withother herbicides that slightly stunt crop growth while killingweeds, Stalker said.   The Calgene-owned Stoneville Pedigreed Seed Co. of Mississippi,the nation's second leading producer of cotton seeds, plans tomarket bromoxynil-resistant cotton seeds by 1992, Salquist said.   He estimated use of the seeds and bromoxynil should reduce the$382 per acre cost of growing cotton in the Mississippi Delta by$46 to $57, including reduced herbicide costs and increased cropyields.   One theoretical concern is whether bromoxynil's breakdownproducts could be toxic to humans who eat plants sprayed with theherbicide. Holt said those chemicals occur naturally in corn,wheat, rye and oats _ which have natural resistance to theherbicide _ and are not known to be toxic.   Stalker said he expects ongoing studies will show thatbromoxynil is completely broken down in the resistant crops,leaving no residue.   Another concern is that weeds might become resistant tobromoxynil, either by crossbreeding with the genetically engineeredcrops or because natural selection will favor survival of mutantweeds resistant to the herbicide while vulnerable weeds die.   Medley said the USDA found no risk of herbicide-resistance beingtransferred sexually to weeds from tomatoes, cotton and tobacco.Holt said she agreed with Stalker that because bromoxynil breaksdown in a couple weeks, development of mutant, bromoxynil-resistantweed populations are less likely than with longer-lived herbicides.</TEXT></DOC>
