(Fiber Distributed Data Interface)(Analysis)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Wexler, Joanie M.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>An FDDI concentrator is an intelligent device that connectsworkstations to a 100M-bps fiber ring in a star configuration.andO;Concentrators have only recently begun to hit the market, andclaims that the products will lower connection costs are beingscrutinized.andP;  Currently the cost per connection to an FDDI LAN isabout $11,000.andP;  This figure is expected to come down asconcentrators proliferate, but a recent market analysis indicatesthat the cost may not come down enough to generate much userinterest.andP;  Concentrators are priced from $4,000 to more than$30,000, depending upon size, and for each workstation an FDDIadaptor card ranges in price from $6,000 to $10,000.andO;Concentrators serve to protect the FDDI backbone and provideenhanced network management and wiring flexibility.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber Distributed Data Interface StandardFiber OpticsConcentratorsNetworksCommunications EquipmentWorkstationsMarket AnalysisCost of Communications.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
