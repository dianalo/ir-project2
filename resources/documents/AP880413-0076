(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Spearheads uncovered in an appleorchard here and a human skull fragment found in Kansas date backmore than 10,000 years and could be evidence of the first humans towalk the continent, scientists say.   Two workers installing underground sprinklers at Randamp;R Orchardslast May stumbled upon stone spear points that could be 11,000years old, said C. Vance Haynes, a University of Arizona professorof anthropology and geology.   ``This is probably one of the most exciting finds that'soccurred in many, many decades,'' Haynes said Tuesday. ``There is apossibility these were the first people into the New World.''   Artifacts uncovered so far in this central Washington towninclude stone tools, projectile points and bone implements. Nohuman remains have been found since formal excavation began Monday,scientists say.   However, a human skull fragment discovered in Kansas wasrecently shown by new dating techniques to be about 15,400 yearsold, reported Larry Martin, a systematics and ecology professor atthe University of Kansas.   The skull fragment, found in 1975, was dated using electron spinresonance, which involves measuring the density of trappedelectrons that accumulate in bone as a result of environmentalradiation after the material is buried.   The fragment likely ``has a real shot at being one of the oldestAmericans,'' Martin, curator of the university's Museum of NaturalHistory, said last week.   Haynes, however, said resonance is a ``much newer and lesstried'' method than the Carbon-14 dating usually used in datingarchaeological discoveries. He said he was unaware of the Kansasdiscovery and was reluctant to compare the two finds.   The Washington artifacts have not been scientifically dated, sayarchaeologists on the excavation team, which includesrepresentatives of Washington State University, the University ofWyoming and the Smithsonian Institution.   The orchard workers initially unearthed about 20 stone pieces,and an additional seven were found by archaeologists on Monday.Many are so-called Clovis points, named after a New Mexico sitewhere such stone tools were initially discovered in the 1920s and1930s.   The points would have been used on the end of spears to stabmammals like elephants, horses and bison, said Peter Mehringer ofWashington State and director of the excavation project.   He, too, contended the find indicates people at least as old asany previously discovered in North America, although finds on othercontinents may be as old as 40,000 years.   ``Clovis is the oldest (North American) culture for which wehave duplicated evidence,'' Haynes said. Archaeologists on thescene said all previous Clovis finds have been scientifically datedto about 11,000 years ago.   Richard Daugherty, a retired WSU professor involved in thedigging, said the Clovis points _ which are fashioned from chippedrock _ are unique in their number and their size.   Some are more than 8 inches long and are brown and cream incolor.   ``This is the largest cache of Clovis points ever found,'' saidDennis Stanford of the Smithsonian Institution. ``Something realinteresting was going on here that we can't explain. The points areabout twice the size they should be.''   Daugherty said scientists are not sure why they would be so big,although Haynes said the size could indicate ceremonial use.</TEXT></DOC>
