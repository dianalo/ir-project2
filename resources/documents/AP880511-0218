Paula Van Ness, director of the CDC's National AIDS Informationand Education Program, said she will leave the agency June 3 tobecome project director of a Ford Foundation plan to funnel fundsinto community AIDS prevention and social service programs.   ``My understanding is she was made an offer too good torefuse,'' said CDC spokeswoman Gayle Lloyd. ``I don't know of anydissatisfaction she had about the pamphlet.''   Ms. Van Ness resigned April 30, three days before the governmentunveiled the brochure it plans to send to 107 million households.The brochures are to be mailed beginning May 26.   There was no announcement of the resignation, but Ms. Lloyd saidthere was no attempt to keep it secret. She said the CDC does notroutinely announce staff resignations.   No replacement for Ms. Van Ness has been named, Ms. Lloyd said.   Ms. Van Ness was out of town and could not be reached Wednesdayfor comment. She told The Atlanta Constitution she was leaving theAIDS information program ``to find some balance in my life,''citing the large amount of travel and ``90-hour weeks.''   Ms. Van Ness joined the CDC in April 1987 after serving asexecutive director of AIDS Project Los Angeles, an AIDS serviceagency.   The CDC's direct mail campaign got off to a rocky start.Secretary of Education William Bennett and officials on thepresident's Domestic Policy Council initially opposed spending the$20 million allocated by Congress on brochures that would carryexplicit information about AIDS directly to households.</TEXT></DOC>
