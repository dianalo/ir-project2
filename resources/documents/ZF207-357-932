 400 on Reader Service CardandM;For power PC users, the ultimate dream might be to plug a VAX into the sideof their machine, making the 32-bit supermini an extension of their 16-bitmicro.andM;Imagine users being able to run any VMS command or application from the DOSprompt, as well as their usual PC applications.andP;  Ideally, they need neverknow that the commands being issued are VMS commands, or that theapplications being used are VAX applications.andM;What's more, host VAXes could act as transparent file servers of almostinfinite capacity, giving multiple PC users centralized access to sharedfiles.andM;Fel Computing's Mobius makes great strides towards providing Pc users withthis ideal interface.andP;  Mobius integrates personal computers and VAXes overEthernet or RS-232-C connections so that the host VAX becomes an extension ofthe microcomputer that's capable of being used as if it were part of the PCitself.andM;Moreover, Mobius give VAX-based users the same control over one or more PCs.andM;HOW IT WORKSandM;The Mobius software includes two components: Host Mobius, which runs on theVAX, and Micro Mobius, which runs on the PC.andP;  These two packages cancommunicate with each other over Ethernet using the Xerox XNS protocol.andM;Although the PC remains a separate entity capable of running normal PCoperations, Micro Mobius allow it to be used as a full-function VT220.andP;  Andwith Host Mobius on the VAX, users can define a logical drive on the PC (forexample, E:) that can be mapped to a directory tree on the remote VAX,letting users store their PC files on the VAX.andM;Mobius does more than just provide terminal emulation and access to VAX-basedfile servers; it also gives users the ability to run any DOS command orapplication from the VAX, and any VMS command or application from the PC.andO;For example, after activating Micro and Host Mobius, a user can spawn aprocess on the VAX, returning to the $ prompt.andP;  Then, typing PC WP launchesWordPerfect onto the PC from the DCL prompt.andM;Just as easily, a vax user can employ Host Mobius to get a directory of fileson the PC's C: drive or to copy a file from one PC drive to another.andP;  The PCand VAX become fused, with the two programs--one running on the VAX and theother on the PC--communicating so seamlessly that users are almost unaware ofthe difference between the two.andM;We tested Mobius version 2.5 using a Micro VAX II running under VMS version4.7 and an IBM PC XT running under MS-DOS version 3.30.andP;  The PC contained anInterlan NI5210-16 Ethernet adapter to connect it to the DR Net network.andO;When installed, Micro Mobius took up 130KB of RAM on the PC.andM;Installation of Mobius is a simple matter, both on the VAX and the PC.andP;  HostMobius is installed on the VAX using Fel's MINSTALL command procedure, whichcomes packaged in the Mobius saveset, rather than DEC's own VMSINSTALprocedure.andP;  Thus, the person installing Mobius must restore the saveset withthe command BACKUP MU A0: MOBIUS.andP;  BCK/SAVE *.* to have access to MINSTALL.andO;Aside from that minor annoyance, MINSTALL is very simple.andM;Once MINSTALL begins running, it will prompt the installer for site-specificEthernet information, such as the name of the Ethernet controller device onthe VAX and host node names.andM;Installation on the PC is just as simple.andP;  Two configurations are possible:one for Ethernet, which we used, and the other for an RS-232-C asynchronousconnection to the VAX.andM;Mobius can be configured for RS-232-C communications by copying the MicroMobius files over to the PC from Fel Computing's distribution floppy disk.andM;The Ethernet configuration is slightly more complex.andP;  Micro Mobius needsaccess to a setup file that is specific to whichever Ethernet board is beingused.andP;  This setup file contains information on the interrupt and the memoryaddress of the Ethernet board.andM;Mobius supports four types of Ethernet boards: the Interlan NI5210-16 andNI5210-8 boards, the 3Com 3C501 board, the Ungermann-Bass family of PCEthernet boards and the Western Digital family of boards.andM;At present, Mobius does not support DEC's DEPCA Ethernet controller for PCs.andM;OFF AND RUNNINGandM;Users start up Micro Mobius on the PC by typing MOBIUS at the DOS prompt.andO;The program begins by displaying a banner screen and a status line informingthe user that Mobius has been successfully installed in the PC's memory.andO;(If, for some reason, the startup fails, the status line will say this andsuggest possible causes of the problem.andP;  Usually, the problem will be thatMobius has already been installed in the PC's memory.)andM;Once installed, Mobius remains in memory and does not to be reinstalledunless the PC is rebooted or the user has deinstalled it via Fel Computing'sNOMOBIUS program.andM;Using a Mobius setup program on the PC called MSETUP, users can create a widevariety of setup environments comparable to those found on the setup menu ofa VT220, as well as offer a selection of text and background colors (Fig.andO;1).andP;  MSETUP will also perform keyboard mapping, allowing users to overcomethe absence of several VT-syle keys on the normal IBM PC keybaoard.andM;Perhaps the first of Mobius' capabilities that users will call on is theterminal emulator, which is invoked by pressing andless;Controlandgt; A. Users arepresented with a list of available VAX nodes and can log in to any host nodethat has the Host Mobius software installed.andP;  Once they have logged in to ahost VAX, users can start Host Mobius by typing MOBIUS at the DCL prompt.andM;From here users have several choices.andM;The simplest is to type OK, which returns them to their PCs but leaves HostMobius active.andM;Users can then enter VMS commands or run VAX programs from their PC by usingone of three utilities that come with Micro Mobius.andP;  These are RUN-CMD, a PCcommand file to run DCL commands; RUNPGM, a command file designed to run VAXprograms; and the generic RUN command, which will perform either of the two.andM;RUNPGM and RUNCMD must be used when it is not posible for Host Mobius todetermine whether a particular character string represent the name of aprogram or the name of a command.andM;TERMINAL EMULATIONandM;Users can press andless;Controlandgt; A on their PC at any time and to return to theterminal emulation mode, and the emulator will be at whatever stage it waslast left in.andP;  Thus, if the emulator had been left with no terminal sessionactive, invoking it again would offer the user a choice of nodes to connectto.andP;  If the user had left a terminal session still active, pressing andless;Controlandgt;A would return the user to that session in which it was abandoned.andM;In our testing, Mobius' terminal emulator recognized all the VT220 charactersets but was unable to display double-high, double-wide or boldface type(Fig.andP;  2) Underlined type was shown with a different color because the EGAvideo card in DR Labs' PC cannot show underlining.andP;  Although Mobius' primaryfunction is not terminal emulation, the absence of these features could proveannoying to users who work with applications that utilize them.andM;Users can invoke Mobius' terminal emulator while in the midst of a PCapplication and, on leaving the emulator, will find themselves back wherethey left the PC.andP;  For example, if a user calls up the emulator while editingdocuments using WordPerfect, Mobius will return the user to his documentwhere he left it, repainting the PC screen just a it was.andM;Mobius also includes a macro program, called MAKE, that lets users create PCcommand files that will run VAX commands or programs, either singly or in agroup, automatically.andP;  (MAKE was actually uses to create the RUN, RUNPGM, andRUNCMD programs.)andP;  The user simply types MAKE at the DOS prompt, followed bythe desired DCL commands themselves, to create such a command file.andM;For example, to create a program to access the EDT text editor on the VAX,the user would simply type C:\MAKE EDT.andP;  This would then create a file calledEDT.COM, which the user could execute by typing EDT at the DOS prompt.andM;Host Mobius also allows users to define virtual micro devices from hostresources.andP;  That is, users can create VAX-based file servers or define VAXprinters so they can be treated as if directly connected to the PC.andP;  Thisfeature is useful for economizing: A single VAX-based laser printer can bemade accessible to a site's PC users as well.andM;The reverse is also possible: Users on the VAX can make use of PC-basedperipherals through Mobius.andP;  Thus, if there is a printer on the PC calledPRINTER, users can create a &quot;queue&quot; on the VAX to send print jobs to the PCprinter by typing DEFINE PRINTER HOST PCPRINTER at the Host Mobius prompt(Mobiusandgt;.andM;Such definitions are lost whenever the use exits from Host mobius.andP;  To avoidhaving to re-enter these definition each time Host Mobius is started, userscan include them in a text file called MOBIUS.MBS.andP;  Mobius searches for thisfile in the user's current directory each time it is invoked.andM;In addition to the user's individual MOBIUS.MBS file, there can also be asystemwide MOBIUS.MBS file with definitions that will be loaded in for eachuser every time Host Mobius is started.andP;  This systemwide file can containdevice definitions and status queries, set the PC's clock from the VAX systemclock, then end with a command to drop the user directly back into MicroMobius.andM;When users define their VAX-based file servers, they can also specify a filetype.andP;  The default is eight-bit files, which should encode all informationfor PC files.andP;  If the user knows that a particular file server will onlycontain text files, a seven-bit file type can be used, which will speed copytimes slightly.andM;PREVENTIVE PROGRAMandM;Trying to TYPE a VAX-based file that was copied to the file server from a PCwithout the seven-bit qualifier will most probably produce meaninglesscharacters on the user's screen.andP;  To prevent this, Mobius includes a VAXprogram to &quot;textify&quot; these eight-bit PC files so they can be read from thehost.andM;Users can edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file on their PC so that Mobius will beinvoked automatically whenever the PC is rebooted.andM;And by using Micro Mobius Task-Force, a high-level applications developer,users can automate the entire process of logging in to the host VAX wheneverthe PC starts up.andP;  This capability can be very handy for system managersseeking to simplify the use of Mobius for less proficient PC users.andM;Similarly, a user's LOGIN.COM file on the VAX can be altered so that HostMobius is started at login time.andP;  The system can be set up so that aninexperienced end user remains completely oblivious to the inner workings ofMobius.andM;Task-Force is Mobius's most powerful utility.andP;  It uses a relatively simple,high-level programming language to accomplish any job that the other parts ofMobius can perform.andP;  It can also call on the PC's own built-in routines, suchas ringing the PC's bell.andM;Task-Force can launch applications on both the PC and the VAX, as well asinitiate file transfers, DOS and VMS shell commands, and so on.andP;  It cansimplify the PC user's work by combining many instructions in oneapplication.andM;One of the sample Task-Force applications that comes packaged with Mobius isPCMAIL.andP;  When run (by typing PCMAIL at the VMS prompt), it enters the VMSMail utility, calls a word processor or text editor on the PC to let the usercreate a message, then sends the message and returns the user to the VMSprompt.andM;This is an example of what Mobius calls &quot;intertask communication&quot;: Anapplication on the VAX calls an application on the PC without the user everyneeding to know the details of what's happening.andM;Another sample Mobius Task-Force application is CALL-LISTEN, which allows thePC to be controlled remotely from the VAX or another PC.andP;  A system managercould use this to perform an unattended backup of the PC onto a file server.andM;One drawback of listen mode is that it does not allow the PC to be usedlocally.andP;  Any commands issued from its own keyboard are ignored; it will onlyrespond to commands from the VAX.andM;It also presents a problem of security, because it allows any VAX user toaccess a PC left in listen mode.andP;  But then no security system can be proofagainst the carelessness of those who use it.andM;For advanced programmers, Fel Computing includes the Mobius AdvancedProgrammer's Interface (API).andM;API allows programmers to call Task-Force utilities from within programswritten in any programming language, similar to the way DCL commands orsystem services can be called from within a VAX program.andM;We tested Mobius' file server by using it to copy files from a PC to a VAXand back again, as well as to start the PC version of WordPerfect from aVAX-based file server and then load in a large word processing document (Fig.andO;3).andP;  In this way we simulated the tasks that a user might typically expectfrom a file server.andM;First we started up Micro Mobius on the PC and Host Mobius on the VAX, thenset up a VAX-based file server that appeared to the PC as drive E:.andM;NExt we copied three files between drive E: and the Pc's own internal harddisk, D:.andP;  These were a 204,317-byte (407-block) text file; a 14,595-byte(30-block) text file; and the application PC WordPerfect, a 244,376-byte(478-block) PC binary file.andM;We called the file transfers to the VAX Send 1, Send 2 and Send WP, and wecalled the file transfers to the PC Receive 1, Receive 2 and Receive WP.andM;Then we timed how long it took to start up PC WordPerfect from the VAXvirtual disk (calling this Start WP) and how long it took to load aWordPerfect version of the larger text file into WordPerfect from the VAX(calling this Load WP).andP;  All times were normalized to the time required forthe same operation using the internal hard drives of our test PC.andM;COMPARATIVELY SLOWandM;It's to be expected that a file server will be slower than operationsperformed from a local disk, and Mobius proved to be no exception registering2.6 to 3.6 times slower in copying files from the PC to the VAX, and as muchas 4.3 times slower in copying files from the VAX to the PC.andM;It was during this test that we discovered Mobius cannot handle any VMS fileformats other than Undefined and ASCII.andM;Thus, when we copied a binary file containing a 20/20 worksheet (created withAccess Technology's 20/20 spreadsheet application for the VAX) from the fileserver to PC and then back again using Stream_LF format, 20/20 was unable toread the file.andP;  Our PC files, however, kept all their characteristics whencopied between the VAX and the PC.andM;Next we timed how long Mobius took to start up the application PC WordPerfectstored on the VAX-based virtual disk.andP;  Timing began when we entered thecommand WP andless;Returnandgt; and ended when the screen cleared to a blank WordPerfectdocument.andP;  We found that starting WordPerfect from the file server was 8.2times slower than starting it from the PC's internal hard drive.andM;Finally, we started WordPerfect from the PC's internal hard drive and timedhow long it took to load in the WordPerfect text file from the file server.andO;Again, the file server was slow, taking 3.6 times longer than the sameoperation performed on the PC's hard drive.andM;Mobius is a feature-packed micro-to-VAX integration package that's capable ofperforming almost any joint VAX and PC operation with a minimum of effort onthe part of the user.andM;Access between the PC and the VAX is nearly transparent, and the user wouldnever know that Mobius was in place but for one thing: Mobius is slow.andP;  Itsperformance in our tests, which were designed to emulate day-to-dayoperations for a typical user, acted as a countering force to thefunctionality of the product.andM;Mobius is unique in its ability to operate the PC from the VAX; this is itstrue forte.andP;  Other products allow manipulation of the VAX from the PC, butMobius is the only product we know of that allows this remote manipulation tobe done in both directions.andM;For one PC and one VAX, the configuration we used to test Mobius, the productis very inexpensive: $595.andP;  In a multiuser environment, Micro Mobius forEthernet is priced at $325, and Host Mobius is priced at $4,500.andP;  TheInterlan NI5210-16 Ethernet card for the PC that we used for our testconfiguration is $425.andM;Overall, we were impressed with Mobius' capabilities.andP;  The ability to join aPC and a VAX is very useful, especially in situations where most users are onPCs but need the power of a VAX.andP;  Nonetheless, the product would benefitgreatly from some substantial speed enhancements.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
