The subject is debated almost daily on radio shows and innewspaper columns. At least two members of the left-leaning LaborParty, Cabinet Minister Ezer Weizman and ex-Minister Abba Eban, havecalled for talking to Yasser Arafat's representatives.   The broad-based Peace Now movement recently changed its positionto support talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.   ``We must speak with them, we must listen, we must exchangewords.... We have to talk to those we want to make peace with,''said Galia Golan, a leading Peace Now figure.   She and Eban are attending a conference on theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict in Amsterdam along with PLO officials,despite an Israeli law against meetings with members of``terrorist'' organizations.   For many Israelis, accepting the PLO is not just a political buta psychological hurdle.   For years, they have associated it with atrocities, such as the1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games in Munich.   But a public opinion poll late last year indicated 54 percent ofIsraelis support talks with the PLO, provided the organizationrenounces terrorism and accepts Israel's right to exist.   The change in opinion is due in part to the Palestinian uprisingin the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in part to Arafat's statementsin December renouncing terrorism and accepting Israel's existence.   Strong tactics aimed at quelling the 13-month uprising, orintefadeh, have brought international criticism of Israel. At least370 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the rebellion.   ``Before the intefadeh, we saw the Palestinians in the occupiedterritories as construction workers, and Palestinians outside wereterrorists,'' said Moshe Amirov, who was kicked out of theright-wing Likud bloc for holding talks with pro-PLO figures twoyears ago. ``Now there is a whole new image: the image of a14-year-old boy who throws stones, and who cannot be beaten by ourarmy.''   The PLO chief's new moderate stance has isolated Israel.   The United States agreed to open a dialogue with the PLO inDecember, and several European nations are urging Israel to do thesame.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likudbloc, repeated Tuesday he would never speak to the PLO. His party'scoalition agreement with Labor takes that stand, but dovish membersof Labor are starting to call for changes.   At least two Labor members are among the four Israeli legislatorswho have attended meetings along with PLO officials in the pastmonth.   Weizman, a former air force officer and defense minister, said inan interview with the Jerusalem Post last week Shamir should dropthe ban on talking to the PLO.   ``Today the only party able to deliver what it promises in theterritories _able to bring about an end to the rioting _ is thePLO,'' he said.   But opponents _ including Likud, which won the most votes inNovember elections _ say the PLO has not changed, despite Arafat'sstatements.   ``The bottom line is they want a Palestinian state in Judea andSamarea just as a down payment to throw us out of here,'' said Likudmember Tzahi Hanegbi. Judea and Samarea are the biblical names ofthe occupied West Bank.   Security risks are a persuasive argument. Even Israelis whosupport talks with the PLO are aware of the risk a Palestinian statemight pose to the Jewish state.   Israelis have fought five wars with Arab states in 40 years andstill remember the vulnerable narrow borders before Israel capturedthe West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war.</TEXT></DOC>
