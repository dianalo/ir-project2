The trade bloc and Japan agreed in July to limit sales ofJapanese-produced cars in the EC for seven years after thecommunity's internal barriers come down in late 1992. Theaccord is meant to ease the transition for European automakers to greater rivalry from abroad.   Martin Bangemann, commissioner for industrial affairs,said the EC is considering helping car makers train theirwork force, carry out research and meet tougher environmentalstandards, though a timetable hasn't been set. An EC officialsaid, &quot;We aren't talking about throwing huge sums at theindustry.&quot;   Mr. Bangemann said it was up to European manufacturers tokeep the Japanese companies' market share low by competingbetter. EC auto makers so far have outpaced the Japanese inEastern European markets.                                                                                                          SEOUL PROBES BIG SPENDERS                                                                                                          South Korea's tax agency is investigating 86 peoplebelieved to have maintained extravagant lifestyles. Theinquiry is part of Seoul's campaign to discourage rampantspending, which is blamed along with inflation and tradedeficits for hurting the economy. Authorities said the probecould be expanded. Tax officials also have opened inquiriesinto luxury service businesses and importers of expensiveforeign goods.                                                                                                          FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN INDONESIA                                                                                                          Jakarta approved $5.03 billion of foreign investments inIndonesia in the fiscal year's first five months throughAugust, outpacing the year-earlier total. Of the 158 projectscleared by Indonesia, Japan remained the biggest foreigninvestor with $342 million in 41 projects, followed by SouthKorea with $160.5 million in 20 projects and the Netherlandswith $153.5 million in three projects. In the year endedMarch 31, approved foreign investment in Indonesia jumped 70%to $9.7 billion from the previous fiscal year.                                                                                                          TRADE INSURANCE IN JAPAN                                                                                                          Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry saidit might have to raise the rates it charges Japanesecompanies for trade and investment insurance. MITI citedgrowing demand for insurance and a rise in reschedulings bydeveloping countries unable to meet payments. For countrieswhere risks have worsened, such as India, Yugoslavia,Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the rate rise may be relativelylarge. For nations where conditions have improved, such asMexico and Turkey, any rise may be small. MITI wantsincreased funding for the insurance program. It reviews itsinsurance rates every two to four years to respond to changesin country risk and budgetary conditions. In 1989, eightrates were increased an average of 40%.

The government orderedinspections to bring logging into legal compliance. And itordered the closure of logging businesses, includingsawmills, wood processing factories, and factories using woodfor energy, that weren't established in line with an earliergovernment decree.
