Reed is interviewed on theresearch and development work his group is doing on submicron,quantum-effect-level transistors.andP;  The group used molecular beamepitaxy and conventional methods to fabricate a gallium-arsenidedevice termed a bipolar resonant tunneling transistor with a baseof 100 angstroms, a 'quantum well' active region of 250 angstroms,and a calculated potential speed of 100 to 200 femtoseconds.andP;  Reedbelieves that the down-scaling goals of quantum-effect technologyare vital to the continued growth of semiconductor technology andmay provide exponential growth in computational power and density.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Texas Instruments Inc.
