Lloyd Bentsen said he has asked congressional tax specialists to prepare a list of possible tax incentives to boost domestic oil production.    &quot;I think you need more direct incentives for new drillings at the well,&quot; the Texas Democrat told reporters. He said he had the staffs of the Senate Finance Committee, which he heads, and the Joint Tax Committee, of which he is vice chairman, &quot;looking at numbers&quot; for proposals to accomplish that end.    An Energy Department study to be released today concludes that tax breaks are the least costly and most efficient way to stimulate U.S. oil exploration and development. The report lists several options, including a 5% tax credit for drilling and a boost in the oil depletion allowance, which is a deduction based on the value of the oil produced.    Energy Secretary John Herrington briefed Sen. Bentsen and a few other oil-state lawmakers on the study yesterday. The study, as expected, states that the cost of oil import fees would exceed their benefits for the economy as a whole.    Sen. Bentsen suggested the sale of offshore leases and the sale of oil from federal lands in Alaska to pay for incentives to boost domestic oil production. Both ideas are likely to be controversial, though Sen. Bentsen called them &quot;very plausible options.&quot; Asked if a gasoline tax was another option, he replied, &quot;At this point, I'm not ready to say that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
