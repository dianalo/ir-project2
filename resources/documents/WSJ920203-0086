As in many other states, California's state prisonpopulation grew explosively during the 1980s -- so rapidlythat wardens were assigning surplus prisoners to gymnasiumsand TV rooms. With as many as 138 prisoners on a singlegymnasium floor, &quot;it gets a little hectic at times trying toobserve everything that's going on,&quot; says prison spokesmanDan Felix.</LP><TEXT>   But now, not only in California but around the nation, theprison population boom may finally be sputtering to a halt --not because all the crooks are off the streets but becausecash-starved states and localities increasingly lack themoney to house them or even to arrest them.   In Michigan, three new prisons stand ready to acceptinmates but will remain mothballed until October. The state'sprison population, which grew by 4,000 people in 1989,increased by only 21 in 1991. In California, where the prisonpopulation quadrupled during the 1980s to more than 100,000,corrections officials actually noted a slight drop in totalinmates in the past five months; at Tehachapi, officials havebegun moving prisoners out of the gyms.   Nationwide, state corrections-spending growth has slowedto 8% annually from 17% the previous two years and has beenreplaced by Medicaid as the fastest-growing state spendingcategory.   If such trends continue, the result could be the firstshrinkage in two decades in the nation's overall prisonpopulation, ending an extraordinary period in U.S.corrections. In the 1980s alone, the number of people inprison more than doubled; currently, 0.3% of the nationalpopulation is behind bars, an incarceration rate that exceedsthat of all other Western democracies.   Civil libertarians and law-enforcement authorities quarrelabout whether this reflects an overzealous justice system ormerely the excesses of a highly individualistic and unrulyculture. But both sides tend to agree that the expansion ofstate prison populations can't continue indefinitely.   &quot;When there was enough money to go around, correctionsreally wasn't much of an issue,&quot; says Thomas Coughlin, NewYork state corrections director and president of theAssociation of State Correctional Administrators. But giventhe desperate financial straits in which many states now findthemselves, Mr. Coughlin says, people are asking, &quot;Wait aminute -- why are we spending so much money on locking uppeople?&quot;   The principal reason for the decline in new prisonadmissions is a fall-off in drug busts. According to theFederal Bureau of Investigation, drug arrests at all levelsof government fell 20% in 1990, the last year for which dataare available. Most experts attribute this fall-off to therecession, which has made drug sweeps prohibitively expensivefor local police departments; police officers who conductsuch sweeps must generally be paid overtime.   In addition, police departments are more inclined than inthe past to forgo arrests for drug possession and devote moreenergy to arresting suspected dealers, according to JamesAustin, executive vice president of the National Council onCrime and Delinquency, based in San Francisco. Mr. Austinsays the shift is a response to new asset-seizure laws thatallow police departments to profit when they arrest wealthydrug lords.   &quot;If there's a choice between going after a guy who livesin a house vs. a guy who lives in the projects, they'll goafter the guy who lives in the house,&quot; he says.   Whatever the cause, the drop in prison admissions comes asa relief to state prison officials, most of whom are stillstruggling with overcrowding as they try to catch up with thenumbers of people already serving time.   In fact, even as California is beginning to ease itsovercrowding problem, New York, Michigan and several otherstates are attempting to save money on prison construction bydoubling up prisoners who once resided in individual cells.The practice was once judged unconstitutional by the SupremeCourt but now appears to meets with its approval. Inaddition, Attorney General William Barr last week announcedthat the Justice Department would start encouraging states togo to court to modify or dissolve federal court orders onovercrowding. In a decision the next day, the Supreme Courtsignaled that it too would allow state prisons greaterlatitude in deciding how to house prisoners.   &quot;Short-term doubling-up is not a problem,&quot; New York's Mr.Coughlin says, provided it doesn't include prisoners inmaximum-security prisons who are the most likely to startprison riots or assault cellmates. Such prisoners areexcluded from double-bunking in his state, he says.   Even for medium- and minimum-security prisoners, however,Mr. Coughlin is unsure about the long-term effects ofdouble-bunking. He says New York's move towarddouble-bunking, which began in 1989, hasn't led to moreviolence, but he notes that it can strain not only prisoners'nerves but also kitchens and sewer systems designed for muchsmaller populations. &quot;I suppose the academics would say let'swait and see what happens,&quot; he says. But &quot;prisons arevolatile places.&quot;   The most politically sensitive option for states lookingto trim corrections budgets is to reduce the length of prisonterms. Alvin Bronstein, director of the American CivilLiberties Union's national prison project, says he recentlymet with members of a Rhode Island task force investigatingearly release programs, prison furloughs and otheralternatives to prison construction. Other states ponderingmoves in that direction include Hawaii, Maine, Indiana andTennessee.   Significantly changing the length of prison stays wouldprobably first require state legislatures to reverse themandatory minimum sentence laws that came into vogue in thepast 15 years and helped swell prison populations to thebreaking point. &quot;If I could have one wish for the new year,it's that we don't pass a new criminal sanction,&quot; says HarrySingletary, secretary of Florida's Department of Corrections.But with memories of furloughed rapist Willie Horton stillfixed in their minds -- from the 1988 presidential campaignin which Republicans successfully made him a major issueagainst Michael Dukakis, who had granted his furlough --governors and state legislators are unlikely to identifythemselves too directly with policies that might be construedas soft on crime.   Says Hal Hovey, a former state budget officer for Ohio andIllinois: &quot;Anytime you start on any of these things, you runa risk there will be an identifiable somebody who as a directresult of the policies you adopt will rape, maim or murder.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
