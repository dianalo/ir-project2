Revenue for the quarter is expected to be 20% below the $89.3 million posted in the second quarter, or an indicated $71.4 million. That compares with $48 million in revenue a year earlier.    &quot;The market for thrombolytic therapy has grown more slowly than anyone anticipated,&quot; said Robert Swanson, founder and chief executive officer of the biotechnology company based in South San Francisco. He cited conservative physicians and confusion sown in the cardiac-care marketplace by a welter of studies about the survival benefits of taking TPA as opposed to its older competitor, streptokinase. Mr. Swanson, speaking at a conference sponsored by Montgomery Securities here, also cited the costs of underwriting small community hospitals' use of TPA.    Genentech shares fell on the news yesterday, closing at $18.875, down 62.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Currently, Mr. Swanson said, only about 120,000, or 30%, of the 400,000 eligible heart-attack patients in the U.S. are receiving thrombolytic, or clot-dissolving, drug therapy for their heart attacks. So, while the current market seems flat, he said, &quot;it is far from penetrated.&quot; The executive said Genentech will target not only the remaining untreated heart-attack victims currently eligible to receive TPA, but also will develop other markets.    These other markets include the 210,000 U.S. patients who are disqualified from getting TPA because they waited longer than six hours to go to the hospital. It also includes the 100,000 patients with a pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot in the lungs. Genentech is currently petitioning for Food and Drug Administration approval of TPA as an embolism therapy.    Despite current snags, Mr. Swanson termed TPA's launch &quot;wonderful,&quot; noting it had racked up higher first-year sales than other blockbuster products, and in only 10 months had captured two-thirds of its marketplace.    He denied the drug's price of $2,300 a dose -- more than 10 times that of streptokinase -- was hindering its growth. He compared TPA's price favorably with the twofold or threefold higher cost of angioplasty, coronary bypass and other kinds of cardiac surgery.    Mr. Swanson also branded as &quot;untrue&quot; rumors of an investigation into possible suppression of data regarding the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, or bleeding in the brain, from TPA. The TPA label currently lists the risk of this complication at less than 0.5%, though the European Cooperative Study Group in March said 1.4% of patients experienced such hemorrhages.    Mr. Swanson further said Genentech has asked the FDA to approve an expanded marketing claim that includes improved survival, based in part upon the European Cooperative Study's report that TPA scored an in-hospital mortality rate of less than 3%, or the lowest death rate ever reported in a major study. </TEXT></DOC>
