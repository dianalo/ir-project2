Saudi, Lebanese and Western European sources say the Saudi role conformed strictly to the country's normal behavior: first, sit on the fence; then move cautiously to satisfy all parties.    In this case, the parties were the U.S., a close ally that sought dialogue with Tehran and support for the Nicaraguan Contras, and Iran, a feared adversary whose trouble-making in the area the Saudis hoped to deflect.    The sources say the Saudi involvement with Iran must be placed in the context of the two nations' proximity across the Persian Gulf, joint leadership of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and enmity by virtue of Saudi financial and logistical support of Iraq's six-year-old war with Iran.    Iranian officials put it more bluntly. &quot;The Saudis had no choice,&quot; says Iranian Petroleum Minister Qolam Reza Aqazadeh, who held talks with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in October. &quot;After six years of trying to ignore us, wishing we would stop the war (with Iraq) or lose interest in pursuing it, they have come around to the notion that revolutionary, fighting Iran is here to stay and they had better deal with us.&quot;    Sources say the Saudi-Iranian relationship evolved along two tracks. One was the murky weapons connection, with built-in deniability, that began last year and used a controversial Saudi figure. The other, begun this year, was a low-profile dialogue with Iran's leadership, aimed at coordinating oil policies and lessening tensions between the two regimes.    According to David Mizrahi, editor of the financial newsletter Mid-East Report, and other well-informed Arab sources, the arms connection germinated in a mid-April 1985 secret meeting in Hamburg, West Germany. It brought together an odd assortment of U.S. officials, including National Security Council aides Robert McFarlane and Lt. Col. Oliver North; a former Israeli Foreign Ministry senior official, David Kimche; Iranian arms dealers; and the Iranian deputy minister for security affairs, Ahmad Kangarlu. With them all was the only known Saudi link: Adnan Khashoggi, a billionaire arms dealer, financier, businessman and sometimes behind-the-scenes diplomatic emmissary for King Fahd.    The 51-year-old Mr. Khashoggi was a one-time gambling companion to the king. Although he fell somewhat out of favor because of the notoriety that surrounded his divorce from his British wife, he still retains close ties to some members of the Saudi royal family, whom he entertains lavishly at his Marbella, Spain, mansion. His mediation in multimillion-dollar arms sales to Saudi Arabia in the 1970s brought him close to Defense Minister Prince Sultan, the king's brother, and to other key people in the Saudi regime -- with whom he shared hefty commissions on the deals.    Mr. Khashoggi's involvement was primarily motivated by a desire to cash in on a big weapons deal in the making. Bankers and friends who know him say his business empire has suffered greatly as the oil price collapse has affected oil producers such as Saudi Arabia. For example, the centerpiece of Mr. Khashoggi's U.S. holdings, Triad America Corp., as of early December faced more than $150 million in legal claims. An Iranian arms deal with U.S. blessing seemed a heaven-sent opportunity to make money, sources said.    According to Mr. Mizrahi, &quot;a company was formed in the Cayman Islands during 1985 by Khashoggi and Cyrus Hashemi,&quot; one of the Iranian businessmen and arms dealers who attended the Hamburg meeting. Mr. Khashoggi told the Saudi royal family what he was up to. &quot;Their attitude,&quot; says a close friend who asked not to be identified, was: &quot;We are glad you told us, but we don't want to hear any more about it.&quot; Mr. Kashoggi himself says he didn't ask for permission to pursue the contacts because he was afraid he would be told not to.    Mr. Khashoggi's subsequent claim that he never made any profits because he never made any deals is disputed, however.    Mr. Mizrahi, who has extensive ties with Arab banking circles, says Mr. Khashoggi, along with Mr. Hashemi and Manoucher Gharbonifar, another Iranian businessman who participated in the Hamburg meeting that launched the arms trade, shared a $10 million commission on the overall $35 million deal with Iran. Going through the Israelis with American acquiescence, they sold U.S. made TOW missiles and other weapons to Iran at inflated prices. Mr. Gharbonifar said in mid-December, however, that an estimated $10 million was still owed to Mr. Khashoggi because of delayed payments on the Iranian sales.    Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia had opened its other not-so-secret channels to Tehran. Startled by the Iranian occupation of Iraq's Fao peninsula earlier this year and worried by reports of a major Iranian offensive in the making, the Saudi leadership indicated it was ready for talks.    In November 1985 a senior Iranian cleric, Ayatollah Mehdi Karubi, visited King Fahd to discuss the disruptive political activities of Iranian pilgrims to Mecca. Iran promised to tone down these demonstrations.    By August, oil had been identified as another important area of mutual interest. Iranian oil-industry sources say behind-the-scenes talks were initiated with King Fahd, bypassing Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani, who was later fired. Iran's representative in those talks, held in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, was oil minister Aqazadeh.    Tehran explained that it viewed the price war conducted by Saudi Arabia and engineered by Mr. Yamani as the equivalent of a declaration of war against it. Collapsing oil prices cut deeply into Iran's revenues. Tehran's answer was to substantially step up attacks on oil tankers sailing in the Persian Gulf to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.    Iran wanted the price war ended. The Saudis wanted an end to attacks on tankers belonging to it and its Arab allies. During the August OPEC meeting, Iran and Saudi Arabia laid the foundation for a clear pact. Saudi Arabia backed away from the price war for two months, in return for a cooling of tensions in the tanker war.    Just before the October OPEC meeting, Iran's oil minister stopped for another meeting with King Fahd in Riyadh. The mutual accommodation was solidified. OPEC extended its accord to cut production to boost prices until year's end. Mr. Yamani, who among other things dragged his feet in cooperating with the Iranians, was fired shortly afterward.    In all these actions, it appears Saudi policy wasn't part of any comprehensive overall strategy. And the Khashoggi arms connection seems to have operated on a track of its own.    &quot;They always operate in very short-term installments,&quot; says a U.S. executive with intimate ties to the Saudi regime. Fundamentally, sources say, the Saudi policy was to please all, reinforced by King Fahd's understanding from the arms connection that the U.S. favored better relations with Iran.    A well-placed Saudi official, discussing the situation on condition he wasn't identified, sums up Saudi actions this way: &quot;As usual, our policy was appeasement. Whenever we are called upon to show strength, we do it in such a way that dilutes the impact of our action.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
