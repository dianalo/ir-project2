(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Computer viruses are a hot topic; here are two ways to keep your Mac cleanand safe.andM;When it comes to computer viruses, I've been lucky - so far.andP;  No infections,but I'm also real careful.andP;  I get and try every virus detector, preventer,and repairer I can find, including the free ones such as Disinfectant andlast year's Eddywinner, Vaccine.andM;The two newest entries in the commercial antivirus market - a burgeoningniche -are 1stAid Software's Anti-Virus Kit and Symantec's SAM (short forSymantec AntiVirus for Macintosh easily the most awkward software title I'vecome across recently).andP;  Both are excellent programs, but because of itsdesign philosophy, SAM is more powerful and more elegant than the Anti-VirusKit.andP;  Either can protect your computer, however, and that is the goal.andM;THE RUNDOWN Both programs provide primary protection via an INIT.andP;  You canconfigure SAM Intercept to check automatically any activity that couldintroduce a known or unknown virus (although no program can guaranteeprotection from all unknown viruses).andP;  Some of the more useful checks occurevery time a floppy is inserted and every time ally of a definable list ofresources is about to be changed.andM;The part of SAM that detects viruses and attempts repair is an applicationcalled SAM Virus Clinic.andP;  It can find every virus known at press time.andM;You should run Virus Clinic periodically in case Intercept misses something.andO;I run it at least once a week.andP;  It's quick, scanning the executable materialin a full 40-megabyte hard drive in just a minute or two.andP;  Networkadministrators will appreciate the nice variety of reports it can produce andprint.andM;But SAM's greatest virtue is the degree to which you can customize just howcarefully it should guard against intrusiveness, I like SAM to check each andevery floppy I insert (except those requested by the Mac as part of a diskswap) and to tell me a lot about what is about to be modified.andP;  I generallyclick to allow an operation to proceed unimpaired - the default buttons arewell chosen and virtually always what I want done.andP;  My awareness of what myMac is doing has been heightened, however, and I've been reminded thatstaying fi-ee of viruses is a matter of continual vigilance.andP;  Based on theway I use my Mac, SAM is perfectly designed.andM;I have some problems with Anti-Virus Kit, on the other hand.andP;  Although itchecks applications before they launch and checks executable code before itruns effectively providing the same level of protection as SAM does - I don'tsee enough action to keep me on my toes.andM;Anti-Virus Kit comes in three pans: VirusGuard, a cdev that operates muchlike SAM's INIT; Inoculator, an application that installs a small historyfile on a disk to record changes on that disk; and Same/Diff, an applicationthat helps you identify the time an infection occurred by comparing a fileyou suspect is infected with your archival version.andM;Although I know that floppies that never leave my desk have a vanishinglysmall chance of becoming infected, I won't accept even a slight chance whenit comes to viruses.andP;  Inoculator is designed to reassure me.andP;  It writes asmall file onto each disk that keeps trac of any changes to the file on thatdisk.andP;  The problem with this system is that yo have to keep reinoculatingyour floppies to keep that history file updated.andP;  When you don't have theapplica- tion handy, you can double click on the Inoc file, and it runs astraight yes-or-no check on the disk, telling you if anything suspicious hashappened.andP;  If anything has, however, it won't tell you which files wereaffected.andP;  To get that informati on, you have to run Inoculator itself It'sprobably worth the protection to go through all this, but it's still ahassle.andP;  I hope this method changes in a future upgrade - it's needed.andM;Anti-Virus Kit doesn't offer any repair functionality.andP;  If it finds aninfected file, you must either replace the file with a clean copy (be sure tocheck it!) or tum to a public-domain repair program.andP;  SAM, on the other hand,can repair most files infected by known viruses.andP;  Obviously, it can't repairunknown viruses.andP;  And it can't guarantee perfect fixes - although it did fixmy dozen infected test files.andP;  As the manuals for both products tell you,however, it's best to trash and replace infected files.andM;Still, I want repair capabilities.andP;  It's just possible that I don't have abackup of some crucial file, and if the master gets infected, then repair ismy only hope.andP;  And I want that hope.andM;THE VERDICT Programs that identify and repair damage from specific virusesmust be updated every time a new virus is discovered.andP;  How quickly (andcheaply) these updates are developed and provided is critical.andP;  SAM doesn'tyet have a track record in this regard.andP;  The standard to match is HJC's Virex(see Quick Clicks, June '89), which has been updated promptly and atreasonable cost several times already.andM;SAM, learning from the trendsetting Virex plan, offers both yearly upgradesubscriptions (for $60) and one-shot upgrades for $15.andP;  If you don't planever to use the repair facilities, you don't need to buy the subscription,although you should upgrade periodically because the program is sure toimprove.andM;As Anti-Virus Kit is directed at the mechanisms by which viruses work and notat specific viruses, 1stAid Software claims this type of continual upgradingisn't necessary.andM;The SAM manual is much better than the Anti-Virus Kit manual, Its level ofdetail and complexity seems perfectly suited to the technical level of mostSAM users.andP;  It has a good balance of technicality and reassurance.andP;  TheAnti-Virus Kit manual isn't bad - it's just that the SAM manual is trulyexcellent.andP;  The AntiVirus Kit manual is aimed at more technically adeptusers.andM;Of the commercial antivirus packages, SAM is now tops.andP;  All of them get thejob done, but SAM does it with an especially high level of simplicity andelegance.andM;- Sloven BobkerandM;Anti-Virus Kit ***1/2andM;List Price: $79.95andM;Published by: 1stAid Software, 42 Radnor Road, Boston, MA 02135;
