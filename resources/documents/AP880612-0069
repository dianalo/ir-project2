The case of John Ray Gunsalus vs. American Tobacco Co. isbelieved to be the first to come to trial linking tobacco andasbestos, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday.   Gunsalus, who smoked two packs of Pall Malls daily, worked atshipyard jobs that left him covered with asbestos, jurors were toldlast week. He died last year at age 55 after smoking since age 11.   In 1985, the surgeon general reported that people who work nearasbestos are five times as likely to get lung cancer as people whodo not come in contact with the substance. Smokers are 10 timesmore likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers. But people whowork near asbestos and smoke are 50 times more likely to get cancerthan people who do neither, according to the report.   Attorney Thomas F. Johnson, who is representing Gunsalus'estate, told the eight-member jury during opening arguments Tuesdaythat Gunsalus should have been told of the dangerous combination ofasbestos and cigarettes.   The tobacco company should have issued special warnings aboutthe added dangers of smoking for people who work around asbestos,according to the estate, which contends that Gunsalus never knew ofthe danger.   The estate originally sued about 12 asbestos companies, alongwith American Tobacco, the maker of Pall Malls. Claims against nineasbestos companies were dismissed and three were settled before thetrial began, according to court records.   Lawyers would not discuss the terms of the settlements and U.S.District Judge Norma L. Shapiro has ordered that jurors not be toldabout the settlements.   American Tobacco contends that it was Gunsalus' choice to smoke,despite warnings from friends and relatives that cigarettes were``cancer sticks.''   ``He is the type of person on whom a warning would have made nodifference whatsoever,'' said Edward F. Mannino, the tobaccocompany's attorney, in his opening arguments.   Mannino argued that the cancer that killed Gunsalus was a raretype not statistically related to cigarette smoking.   The only period for which cigarette makers can be held liable,according to federal court appeals decisions, is prior to 1966.That year, health warnings began to be placed on cigarette packs.   Gunsalus was diagnosed with cancer of the lung, liver and headin 1985.   Monday will be the first anniversary of Gunsalus' death at theVeterans Administration Medical Center in Philadelphia. His deathcertificate listed the cause of death as a brain tumor, caused bylung cancer, which led to a fatal drop in blood pressure.</TEXT></DOC>
