(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An American who said he disguised himselfas an Arab and made a seven-day, 700-mile escape across the desertfrom Kuwait returned home Friday to a tearful welcome from hisfamily.   Ernest Briskey, assistant vice president for internationalprogram development at Oregon State University, spent 110 days inhiding in Kuwait City before making his way to Amman, Jordan, onTuesday.   Briskey, a food technology expert and former dean of agricultureat Oregon State, was working as a senior adviser to the KuwaitiInstitute of Scientific Research when Iraqi forces invaded thecountry on Aug. 2.   His wife, three children and 4-year-old granddaughter welcomedhim on his arrival at Portland International Airport.   He declined to talk about the specifics of his escape because offear of reprisal for those who helped him. Those who gave him aidduring his time in hiding and as he escaped would be executed ifthey were caught, he said.   Briskey, 59, spoke about the damage done in Kuwait by the Iraqiarmy.   ``It's been an incredibly brutal destruction of a people and acountry, actually much worse than what has been portrayed perhapsto the American people,'' he said.   Briskey said the Iraqis were removing everything of value fromKuwait.   ``They brought trucks down,'' he said. ``They took dairy cows,all the chickens, all the computers, all the cars. They tookanything moveable, hospital supplies.''   Briskey said he heard many tales of brutality.   ``I personally know that they did shoot members of families ifthey found anything American,'' Briskey said. ``I know people whosaw this happen. They shot people including a 70-year-oldgrandfather because a passport was found.''   Briksey said he lived in four different places while in hiding,and there were many times he nearly was captured.   ``I spent time under bushes outside the house, under airconditioners and under water tanks while searches were beingthreatened,'' Briskey said. ``One time I could count 200 soldiersand more than a half a dozen tanks outside my window.''   Asked how he spent his time, Briskey said, ``I listened to theBBC every hour on the hour and I read a lot. I read the Bibletwice.''   He said he supports President Bush's actions in the region andonly wishes the buildup of forces had come sooner. He hopes war canbe avoided but said he saw no signs that Saddam Hussein is willingto withdraw Iraqi forces from Kuwait.   ``Kuwait is not Kuwait anymore,'' he said. ``It is all bunkered.Ridges are built out of sand with machine guns and all the barbedwire and the mines.''</TEXT></DOC>
