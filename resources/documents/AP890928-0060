(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A youth broke into tears as he describedwhy he beat his mother to death with a baseball bat on the eveningbefore he was to graduate as valedictorian of his high school class.   But the show of emotion didn't sway Niagara County Court JudgeCharles J. Hannigan, who on Wednesday rejected William Shrubsall'spetition that he be granted youthful offender status and sentencedhim to 5 to 15 years in prison.   Hannigan rejected defense attorney Paul Cleary's contention thatShrubsall had been physically and emotionally abused for years andthat the abuse led to the beating death of Marianne ``Marge''Shrubsall in the family's Niagara Falls home on June 25, 1988.   ``In this case, from my way of seeing it, I don't think we haveany real physical abuse,'' Hanningan said. ``And I don't believethere was any emotional abuse to any significant degree.''   Shrubsall, 19, was originally charged with second-degree murderin the death of his 56-year-old mother, but the charge was reducedto manslaughter June 6 following a plea bargain.   Cleary argued for about an hour that Shrubsall was entitled toyouthful offender status, which would have reduced his sentencesignificantly and made it possible for the conviction to beexpunged from his record.   Under state law, Shrubsall must serve at least 5 years of hissentence before becoming eligible for parole.   At the sentencing hearing, Shrubsall said the level of violencein his house ``was getting worse'' since his father died two yearsbefore. ``After my father died, there was no one there to defendme,'' he said, crying.   ``That was not the Cleavers,'' said Cleary, referring to theidyllic family portrayed on the television series ``Leave It toBeaver.'' ``This was not a happy household. This was a relationshipwith problems.''   But in refusing the youthful offender petition, Hannigan said hethought Shrubsall ``came from basically a normal household.''   Hannigan ordered the sentence be stayed until it could bereviewed by an appeals court. He allowed Shrubsall to remain freeuntil the appeal is decided.</TEXT></DOC>
