Logistically, the solution is simple _ the overflow from theOmni Coliseum will go into the adjacent World Congress Center. Butit may not be so simple to soothe the hurt feelings of partyhotshots who find themselves relegated to watching the proceedingson giant television screens next door.   ``We'll have fewer spectator seats in the Omni, and there aregoing to be people who are disappointed they aren't going to be inthe Omni,'' said Ruth Berry, press secretary for the DNCC, which isin charge of organizing the July 18-21 extravaganza.   The Omni, which seats more than 16,000 for the NBA Atlanta Hawksgames, is being redesigned for the convention, cutting down theseating to about 11,000. The architectural changes include a podiumand news media facilitiies.   Among the horde of 35,000 will be about 15,000 representativesof the news media and 5,000-plus delegates and alternates. Theremainder will be made up of invited guests, pages, messengers,security.   Credentials, the color-coded badges that spell entree to thegathering, will be issued to the media, delegates and alternates,invited guests, pages, messengers, security, state governors andlieutenant governors, members of Congress, Democratic staff,officers of the convention and service workers.   Mayor Andrew Young admitted there may be problems accommodatingall 35,000 people, but with minor adjustments they can be resolved.   ``We didn't design the city for the Democratic NationalConvention. We did design the city for most conventions,'' Youngsaid. ``But when you come with as many press people as delegates,you've got to make some adjustments.''   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk said, ``We knew therewould be limited space. But it is adequate to accommodate all thedelegates and additional guests. It will be a little difficult forthe media. This is not a sprawling complex (The Omni), but it's nota theater in the round.''   Ms. Berry said there are seven levels of credentials,color-coded to indicate access. Some credentials will get thebearer into everything; others are severely limited. She would notdivulge the color breakdown.   ``Each credential will have an access level that is appropriateto the function of the credential holder,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
