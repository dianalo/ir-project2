The given effusivesare enriched in U and Th. It is shown that Rb.Sr isochronous age foreffusives studied equals 416+-13 m years. The assumption is made on durableexistence of magmatogenous hydrothermal system with mantle source ofrare and radioactive elements (according to the data of /sup 87/Sr//sup86/Sr isotopic ratios) in this region long ago.</TEXT></DOC>
