Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed, foreign minister of Kuwait, asked byreporters about the hijackers, said ``regrettably we have toconcede they are Arabs.''   The 4-month-old Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupiedterritory has brought an unusual degree of unity among Arabs,radical and moderate, supporting Arabs youths defying Israeli armedforces with stones and bottles.   Pictures of the two Kuwaiti bodies thrown out of the jumbo jetin Cyprus on Saturday and Monday and wired to newspapers andtelevision stations around the world, shook that unity. ``Thisincident has spoiled the image of the Arabs in the world,'' saidPresident Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.   Mubarak said Israeli attempts to put down the uprising in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where more than 140 Palestinianshave been killed since Dec. 8, were ``our prime preoccupation.''   Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization,issued a message to the hijackers of the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747that ``their action is not only hurting the Kuwaitis but the Araband Islamic nation.''   Arafat said the hijacking _ which has taken the plane andhostages from Mashhad, Iran, to Larnaca, Cyprus, to Algiers,Algeria, in nine days _ took away the glare of world publicity fromthe Palestinian revolt.   ``This action diverts world attention from the uprising in theWest Bank and Gaza, and from the brutal and oppressive measures ofthe Israeli occupying authorities,'' Foreign Minister Taher Masriof Jordan told The Associated Press in Amman on Wednesday. Israelcaptured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan inthe 1967 Middle East war.   Marwan Dudin, Jordanian minister of occupied territories, saidthe hijack ``contributed to harming the image of Arabs worldwide.''   Dudin said most Europeans link Islam and Arabs and connect anyMoslem group with the fundamentalist revolution in Iran ofAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   Masri said the hijack should not affect the Arab image. ``Afterall we are the victims'' he said. Furthermore, he said: ``It isclear they (the hijackers) are backed by the Iranian regime.''   Although the current hijack is complicated by an alleged roleplayed by Iran _ which is Persian, not Arab _ it is not the firsttime Arabs have hurt the image of their cause by violent disunity.   Infighting including assasinations have plagued the PLO.   For 13 years the world has been seeing gory scenes of Arabkilling Arab in the complicated carnage of the Lebanese civil war.In the summer of 1977, border clashes brought Egypt and Libya tothe brink of war.</TEXT></DOC>
