TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Syria is believed to be seeking NorthKorea's help in acquiring new surface-to-surface missiles after theUnited States pressured China to cancel a reported deal, Israelimilitary sources said Friday.   The sources also said North Korea and Egypt have begun a projectto develop missiles patterned after Soviet-designed Scud missiles.   The revelation by the sources, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, comes at a time of mounting concern in Israel about anintensified missile race in the Middle East.   Fears intensified following Iraq's Dec. 7 launching of the Abed,a 48-ton, three-stage ballistic missile that Baghdad claimed wascapable of putting satellites into space.   North Korea has a well-developed arms industry, and the Israelisources said it had supplied Iran with Soviet-designed Scudsurface-to-surface missiles during Tehran's war with Iraq.   The military sources said part of the Egyptian-North Koreanmissile project was being developed in Egypt.   Aharon Levran, a retired brigadier general and an independentmilitary analyst, said Egypt had an arsenal of aging Scud missilesprovided by the Soviet Union and had apparently turned to NorthKorea last year for help in modernizing them.   ``It's not known exactly what sort of help the North Koreans canprovide, whether it is just to renew the old Soviet missiles andprovide spare parts or maybe install improved components such asguidance,'' he said.   He also said published reports indicated North Korea was helpingIran develop its own surface-to-surface missile and was trainingpilots for the Tehran regime.   The Scud-B, which has a range of 180 miles and poor accuracy,was introduced into the Middle East in the early 1970s.   Cairo apparently dropped out of a project with Argentina andIraq t develop a more accurate missile called the Condor 2 or Badr2000. The missile was intended to have a range of about 540 milesand better accuracy than the Scud.   Egypt's withdrawal followed political pressure brought byWashington after the arrest of two Egyptian colonels who wereaccused of trying to smuggle technology out of the United Statesthat could be used to improve missile accuracy.   President Bush sent National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft toBeijing this month to urge the Chinese to cancel a planned sale toSyria of M-9 surface-to-surface missiles, which have a range of 370miles and would be capable of hitting targets deep inside Israel.   The Jerusalem Post reported Syria signed an agreement with Chinafor 140 M-9 missiles at a cost of $170 million.   Israeli officials have said Israel was informed that China hadpledged to refrain from such sales, although some doubts stillexisted about whether China would go through with the sale.   Officials in Beijing have denied any sale was in the works.   Syria has Soviet SS-21 missiles capable of hitting northernIsrael and Scud-B missiles.   Levran said the Syrians would likely be interested in NorthKorean help only if they could improve the range and accuracy ofthe Scuds. Unlike the Egyptians, he noted, Syria has close tieswith the Soviet Union and would likely be able to get replacementmissiles without the need for renovation.</TEXT></DOC>
