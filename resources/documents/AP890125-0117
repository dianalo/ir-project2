Scientists studying the volcano said Wednesday there were signsanother major eruption was developing.   ``Based on the volume of magma that exists there may be a major,powerful eruption to match'' those that occurred in 1926 and 1962,said Yoshio Fujii, professor on volcanology and petrology atHokkaido University.   Fujii based his prediction on analysis of rock samples taken fromnearby peaks following the Dec. 19 eruption of the 6,814-foot MountTokachi in central Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.   Koichi Ueda, an official of Kamifurano-cho, a town of 14,000people just 15 miles from Mount Tokachi, said 13 town officials weremaintaining an around-the-clock watch.   No damage or injuries were reported in the Dec. 19 eruption.   Heat from Mount Tokachi's eruption in 1926 melted almost all thesnow on the mountain, causing mudslides that killed 144 people andinjured another 200 in two nearby villages. A smaller eruption in1962 killed four people.   Activity inside Mount Tokachi has intensified since Jan. 9because magma is rising from deep within the Earth to about 1,650feet below the crater of the volcano, according to Hiroshi Okada,head of Hokkaido University's Usu volcano Observatory.   ``The form of volcanic activity has started changing,''indicating the possibility of an explosion of magma from themountain, Kyodo News Service quoted Okada as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
