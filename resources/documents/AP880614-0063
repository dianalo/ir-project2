LEE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>IMJINGAK, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of radical studentschanting anti-American slogans demonstrated today at the edge ofthe demilitarized zone for reunification of North Korea and SouthKorea.   About 1,300 students staged a sitdown protest in front of abridge leading to the zone that divides the Korean peninsula. Thebridge was blocked by steel barriers and rolls of barbed wire.   ``Drive out Yankees who hinder unification'' and ``Advanceunification,'' students chanted.   The students denounced the government of President Roh Tae-wooand yelled slogans calling on all South Korean students to refusecompulsory weekly military training. The training is required forall male students.   U.S. Army troops that normally guard the bridge were withdrawnbefore the students arrived today. A few South Korean personnelwere seen guarding the bridge on the other side of the barriers.   The students, from Korea and Joongang universities in Seoul,went to Imjingak in a convoy of buses for a prayer ceremony forreunification. They were accompanied by professors from the twoschools to help ensure the demonstration was peaceful.   Imjingak, the last civilian area on the main road from Seoul, isabout three miles from the southern edge of the demilitarized zone.   The government banned a march Friday to the border withcommunist North Korean by thousands of radical students seekingtalks with North Korean student delegates on reunification.   Fierce street clashes erupted in Seoul when riot police blockedradicals going to the border, and about 900 students were arrested.   Student leaders said today's demonstration, described as aprayer ceremony for unification, was different from Friday's marchsince there were no plans to enter the demilitarized zone or meetwith North Korean representatives. The South Korean government saysit alone can have contacts with the north.   The 2{-mile-wide zone separates the two Koreas with the borderrunning through the center. Forces of the two sides control theirrespective sides of the zone.   U.S. troops help control the south's side of the zone acrossfrom Imjingak and the Panmunjom truce site that straddles theborder.   Students wanted to meet Friday at Panmunjom with North Koreanstudent delegates who reportedly were waiting there.   Radical students have been demanding reunification of the Koreanpeninsula, divided since 1945 when U.S. and Soviet troops ended theJapanese occupation at the end of World War II.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-governmentand anti-American protests during the past month. Radical studentsbattled riot police to press for overthrow of the Roh governmentand reunification.   The radicals, a small but powerful minority among South Koreanstudents, claim the United States enforces partition of thepeninsula to rule the south. Radicals demand withdrawal of the42,000 U.S. troops based in the south under a defense treaty.   The radicals have been unable to attract public support. MostSouth Koreans fear the north is determined to conquer thepeninsula. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start theKorean War.</TEXT></DOC>
