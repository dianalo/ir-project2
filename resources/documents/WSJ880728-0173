The 1,456,358 shares of Series B convertible preferred have been priced at $10.50 a share and are convertible into 30 shares of Genex common, providing a common stock equivalent yield of 35 cents a share.    The rights, available only to current shareholders of the applied biotechnology concern, entitle holders to purchase one share of the new convertible preferred for every 20 shares of common or every 20 shares of Series A preferred stock or a combination of the two that they now hold. The rights can be exercised through Sept. 15.    Genex said that several venture capital firms that participated in last year's restructuring and refinancing of the company have agreed to buy at least $4 million of the new securities. The firms include Morgenthaler Ventures, Plant Resources Venture Funds and funds associated with Citibank and Eberstadt Fleming. </TEXT></DOC>
