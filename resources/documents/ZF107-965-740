(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Working togetherandM;In these days, when workstations and workgroups are buzzwords and theemphasis is on networked PCs rather than stand alone users working inisolation, ways of communicating between workstations are becoming vital.andM;Everyone knows about email.andP;  The current row between British Telecom andtheir erst-while Telecom Gold customers, Microlink, has focused a lot ofmedia attention on the way it can be used to send messages all over theworld.andP;  But long before PCs sat on everyone's desk, private email systemswere helping people to talk to each other in the world of mainframecomputing.andM;But now it's possible to compose an email message up here in Yorkshire, wheremost of my PCs sit, and send it either to my London office, so it's waitingfor me when I arrive, or to another workstation in the UK, the US or anywhereelse.andM;With some products you can attach files to a mail message, so it would bepossible to send graphics or even executable files to the other side of theworld in less time than it takes to say 'Hayes-compatible'.andM;Another significant feature is the ability to set up and compare schedulesfor all users on the network, allowing administrators to know what everyoneis doing, users to coordinate their diaries and so on.andM;Of course, not all network mail programs have all these features.andP;  But thevariety of facilities available mean that network administrators have a widerange of options to choose from.andM;HigginsandM;Higgins is being promoted largely on the basis of its group schedulingcapability which makes a lot of sense, as it's very sophisticated in thisrespect.andP;  Not only does it allow one user to see when other people would befree, but it allows managers to override local diaries and set up mandatorymeetings.andM;When the program is run, users are prompted for the ID set up by theadministrator -- with or without password.andP;  Users can log on to their ownmailbox from other users' workstations.andP;  Meetings can be associated withresources (meeting rooms, equipment and the like) and expenses forms can alsobe completed, associated with client names and so on.andM;After log-in, the screen displays a bar chart of the user's day, a calendarfor the month with the current day highlighted and asterisks against the dayswith meetings scheduled, and a Lotus-style menu of the options availablealong the bottom of the screen.andM;These include Mail, To-Do Retrieval (which surveys the schedules usingkeywords), Xternal (which brings up a menu of DOS options), Directory (for amodem telephone book) and a utility program for changing the program'sparameters.andM;With Higgins Exchange (which wasn't supplied with the review software), it'salso possible to exchange mail and schedules with remote workstations, eitheron other networks or across dial-up lines.andM;The program contains quite a reasonable text editor, accessed by pressing thefunction key.andP;  This 'scratch pad' has case-sensitive search, but not searchand replace, and can import or export text.andP;  A note of this kind can also beattched to a schedule item.andM;Launching of other programs isn't as easy to set up as it might be.andO;Information on the applications which will be included in the pop-up menu iscontained in a text file, HIGMENU.MNU, which has to be edited in a texteditor.andM;However, after installation this file is marked read-only so even though itcould be amended from the scratchpad, the attribute must be reset toread/write first.andP;  This is a mite unfriendly.andM;There are two TSR programs, Mailcall and Apptcall, which can be used tonotify the arrival of any mail or of any appointments which have been set upin Higgins.andP;  Up to ten appointments can be scheduled.andM;The program is the best-documented of all three, with a comprehensivetutorial.andM;WordPerfect OfficeandM;Anyone familiar with any of the WordPerfect products, especially theWordPerfect Library or WordPerfect Executive shell systems, would be veryhappy with WordPerfect Office.andP;  This is because it works in a very similarway, with the same idiosyncratic use of the function key commands.andM;It comes with a pre-configured shell, already set up for the WordPerfect wordprocessor, spreadsheet, and database -- though setup will need to be run toestablish the correct paths to these.andM;If all program files are kept on the fileserver, then a commonshell can beused by all workstations, but it's possible to set up individual shells byfollowing the Shell command with a filename, for example, SHELL STATION1.FILwill load the shell specific to that station.andP;  The file extension must betyped, or the default shell will be loaded.andM;It's possible for the adminstrator to turn password protection on or off, butno sign-on procedure is provided, as the program takes its user informationfrom the network ID.andP;  It isn't possible for users to check their own mailfrom other peoples' stations, which is sometimes handy.andP;  However, it alsomeans no one else can read your mail just by knowing your password, which isalso useful.andM;Nevertheless, you can read mail from another workstation if the followingcommand is typed in from the DOS command line: ML/@U-username.andM;This will only work if a password has been set up, denying users access untilthe correct password is typed in.andP;  The command ML/C checks for mail and itreturns to DOS if there isn't any.andM;Mail can't be sent across dial-up lines to remote offices, although there's apoint-and-dial option within the Notebook flatfile program.andP;  I've beeninformed that dial-up mail will be in version 2.1, due out before the end ofthe year.andM;It's possible to attach files to mail messages and detach them when they'vearrived.andP;  It's also possible to have users alerted when mail arrives, eitherwithin WordPerfect Office, another program, or even when just the DOS commandline is displayed.andM;The other powerful facility contained within WordPerfect Office isscheduling.andP;  Users setting up an appointment can check whether there are anyconflicts with other users' schedules.andP;  No details of other people'sappointments are given -- just the blocks of time occupied.andM;It's also possible for users to insert appointments into each other'sdiaries.andP;  If appointments are rejected, a reason is requested, which is thencommunicated back to the original (with bleeped notification).andM;WordPerfect Office is an excellent implementation, as one would expect fromthis stable.andP;  Lack of external communications is due to be remedied soon, butfor internal network mail and scheduling, plus a shell for other programs, itwould be hard to beat at this price.andM;Network CourierandM;In comparison with the other two, it might be thought that Network Courierwas overpriced and under featured, since it has no scheduler, no shell forlaunching other applications, and it's the same price as Higgins, which hassuperb scheduling.andM;But what Network Courier does is to send and receive electronic mail, fromany point on the globe to any other, with a potentially huge number ofmailboxes, and it does this superbly.andM;As with the other two, the toughest part of the installation is the networkadministrator's job.andP;  I had some initial problems, since the manual talksabout installation on the C: drive, which is invariably a local drive, but itactually needs to be on a fileserver (F on my AST Ethernet network).andM;The program also expects to find its data files on drive M, so on my Novellsystem, with the highest drive letter G: (and Y: reserved for some systemfiles) I had to use the MAP command.andP;  I also set up a stand alone PC inLondon, and there I used the Subst command to do much the same thing.andM;My one complaint about Network Courier would be that it isn't wellintegrated.andP;  The MAIL.EXE program is used for sending and receiving mail, butto receive mail across dial-up lines, the EXTERNAL.EXE must be running.andO;However, External has no mail-reading facilities, so after mail has beenreceived, you have to come out of External and run Mail or go to anotherterminal.andM;However, there's a memory-resident program, MONITOR.EXE, which can be rununder External, and accessed by pressing the Alt-+ key combination.andP;  Monitoruses up 78Kb of available RAM, which is not excessive, but for those withtighter memory constraints and more modest requirements, there's a cut downmemory-resident option, MICRO.EXE.andM;This uses a mere 12Kb, but all it does is tell you there's a message.andP;  Youhave to run Mail to read it.andP;  Monitor has its own 'logoff' command to removeit from memory, but to close down Micro you have to run a specialREMOVEIT.COM utility.andM;Another memory-resident program is OPERATOR.EXE, which is tailor-made forrecording telephone messages and transmitting them to a user's mailbox.andP;  LikeMonitor, this uses the Alt-+ key combination, and it uses just 63Kb.andP;  Itcan't be used to read mail, however.andM;I found External was very fussy about the sort of modem used.andP;  The programdidn't like either my Miracle WS3000 modem or the WordPort 2496 fax/modemcombination, though both are notionally Hayes-compatible.andP;  The distributorsrecommend a 'proper' Hayes modem, and this is said to allow communication upto an effective 19,200 baud if 9,600 baud plus compression is selected.andM;The program checks the serial number, or sign-on ID, of the program on theremote system, and it won't talk if the same number appears at both ends ofthe line.andP;  You need to have a separate copy of the External software on bothends.andM;Although it took longer to get up and running than the others, largelybecause of poor documentation, when the distributors' hotline had cleared upthe question of a fileserver called C, it ran like a dream.andP;  I was never ableto get the External program to work, however.andM;ConclusionsandM;Network mail is a notoriously tough area, and it was remarkable that allthree programs performed well.andM;For mail alone, Network Courier was probably the best, although it could dowith better integration of all the various features.andM;Similarly, although the main features of Higgins worked brilliantly, changingthe application menu and setting up the TSR parameters was more cumbersomethan it need have been.andM;For a good balance of integration, ease of use and features, at a veryreasonable price, WordPerfect Office would be my choice, especially sinceI've already got WordPerfect on my system, and I'm getting used to its funnylittle ways.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
