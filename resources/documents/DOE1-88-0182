It will be shown that the recombinationwith electrons limits the ion density and the recombination is fasterif the ion is in an excited vibrational state. These ions determine thereaction rates with other gases. When impurities of the order of 1 ppMare present, it will be shown that the ion resides on the impurity. Impuritiesare shown to affect the temperature dependence of the D{sub 2} + T{sub2} reaction. The decrease in reaction rate with increasing temperatureabove 220 K is consistent with the increasing vapor pressure of an impurity,but the level must be below 10 ppM. Unfortunately, such an impurity maybe below the level of our present detectability. How this situation maycome about in the DT reaction will be discussed. 17 refs., 3 figs., 4tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
