After a morning of unsuccessful hunting on the Mendenhallwetlands near Juneau, Gary Gunstrom finally dropped his first duckof the season Sunday.   As his golden retrievers dashed after the bird, a mature eagleswooped down and stole it.   ``He just snatched that thing and didn't even pause,'' Gunstromsaid. ``The one dog couldn't believe it.''   It was the only duck Gunstrom saw all day, but he doesn'tbegrudge the eagle an easy meal.   ``No, he can have it,'' said Gunstrom, a biologist with thestate Department of Fish and Game. ``It was worth the trip justseeing that happen. The sort of thing that can only happen uphere.''</TEXT></DOC>
