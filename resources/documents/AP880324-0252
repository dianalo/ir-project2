Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro later said the Nicaraguantroops had pulled out.   Nicaragua had denied that its soldiers penetrated Honduranterritory.   Castro said Honduran air force reconnaissance flights onThursday found there were no longer Sandinista troops on theHonduran side of the border.   ``The situation at the border apparently is calm,'' he told TheAssociated Press by telelphone.   A ministry communique earlier Thursday said 300 heavily armedSandinista soldiers crossed the border in the San Andres de Bocayregion, scene of fighting last week when Nicaraguan troops droveContra rebels back into Honduras. The area is about 150 miles eastof Tegucigalpa.   The latest incursion occurred about 8 p.m. Tuesday, about thesame time as 50 other Sandinista soldiers entered Honduras nearPico Espanol, a village in El Paraiso province about two miles fromthe border, the communique said.   It did not say if there was any combat.   In Managua, Nicaragua's capital, a Defense Ministry spokesmanwas asked about the Honduran report. ``That's negative,'' he said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo declined Thursday to discussthe reported incursions.``We continue to act with prudence,'' hesaid.   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras was in Guatemala onThursday for a meeting with other Central American foreignministers.   The government said last week there were up to 2,000 Sandinistatroops in Honduras and later said all had retreated back toNicaragua.   Honduran jets raided Nicaraguan targets in the Bocay regiontwice last week and Azcona said then that he would send morewarplanes to attack Nicaraguan troops if they did not leave.   That incursion and a request for help by Azcona Hoyo resulted inthe emergency deployment of 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras last week.   The Americans, who are conducting joint training exercises withHonduran soldiers, are expected to leave this country early nextweek, the Pentagon said.   Meanwhile, Honduras has asked U.S. Ambassador Everett Briggs fora clarification on reported comments by U.S. Defense SecretaryFrank Carlucci about the reason American soldiers are in Honduras.   In a news release late Wednesday, Lopez Contreras said he wantedto know why U.S. authorities were saying the Americans were here toprotect Contra rebels in Honduras.   ``These (American) troops that came to Honduras were requestedby the government of President Jose Azcona Hoyo regarding thethreat of incursions from the Sandinista army against the nationalterritory ... and not for the principal objective of fortifying orprotecting the Nicaraguan insurgents who are struggling against theSandinista regime,'' Lopez Contreras said.   He proposed the creation of a peacekeeping force along theborder region.   Briggs refused to meet leaders of seven citizens organizationsat the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa Thursday.   The leaders, whose groups are united under the umbrellaCoordinating Committee for Popular Organizations, later met at aplaza where about 200 people had gathered and read a letterprotesting U.S. troops in Honduras.   The letter said the presence of U.S. troops in Honduras meant``that our country has been converted into a battle platform in theCentral American region.''</TEXT></DOC>
