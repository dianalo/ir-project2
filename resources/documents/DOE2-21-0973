<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0973 </DOCNO><TEXT>This document is the first in a new line of TRADE resources designed toprovide DOE and contractor training personnel with the tools needed tomeet steadily increasing training requirements. The interim final rule,29 CFR 1910.120, issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) in compliance with the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct (SARA), requires that workers at operations involving hazardous wastetreatment, storage, and disposal receive 24 hours of training describingtechniques for worker protection and the health effects of hazardousmaterials. The training requirements in the proposed rule published onAugust 10, 1987, are substantially the same as those in the interim finalrule. The training required by this rule is different from training requiredby the Environmental Protection Agency through the Resources Conservationand Recovery Act (RCRA) which deals with procedures for handling wastematerials. The SARA/OSHA training focuses on informing workers aboutthe health hazards within their facilities and how to minimize them.The instructional materials in this volume were originally developedby the Technical Resources and Training Program Staff at Oak Ridge NationalLaboratory (ORNL) to provide 24 hours of initial training to hazardouswaste treatment, storage, and disposal facility workers as required byOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120. ORNL determined that these materials met the criteriafor the 24 hour training requirement after an extensive needs analysisof related regulations and their application to the hazardous waste siteswithin the laboratory.</TEXT></DOC>
