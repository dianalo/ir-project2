In Bremen or Hannover?&quot; &quot;Wolfgang Hoffman, the Datex networkmanager in Germany, doesn't know.andP;  For all we know he could be in Paris,calling long distance.&quot;andM;Yesterday it was Bremen.andP;  Today Hannover.andP;  Where would he hide tomorrow?andM;The hacker, I discovered, didn't take holidays; he even logged in on NewYear's Day.andP;  His hacker's celebration was saved on my printers.andP;  I scribblednotes on the printouts, next to his:andM;WELCOME TO THE ARMY OPTIMIS DATABASEandM;PLEASE ENTER A WORD OR 'EXIT'.andM;/ SDI Looking for SDI dopeandM;THE WORD &quot;SDI&quot; WAS NOT FOUND.andP;

 Page after page was filled with army doubletalk.andP;  Atone point, my printer jammed.andP;  The old DECwriter had paid its dues for thepast ten years and now needed an adjustment with a sledgehammer.andP;  Damn.andO;Right where the hacker had listed the army's plans for nuclear bombs in thecentral European theater, there was only an ink blot.andM;Around noon on Sunday, January 4, my beeper sounded.andP;  I jumped for thecomputer, checked that the hacker was around, then called Steve White.andO;Within a minute, he'd started the trace.andM;The hacker tried the Air Force Systems Command, Space Division, and managedto log in as Field Service: not as an ordinary user but as oneandM;with a completely privileged account.andM;His first command was to show what privileges he'dandM;garnered.andP;  The air force computer responded automatically: System Privilege,and a slew of other rights, including the ability to read, write, or eraseany file on the system.andM;He was even authorized to run security audits on the air force computer.andP;  Icould imagine him sitting behind his terminal in Germany, staring indisbelief at the screen.andP;  He didn't just have free run of the Space Command'scomputer; he controlled it.andM;Confident that he was undetected, he probed nearby computers.andP;  In a moment,he'd discovered four on the air force network and a pathway to connect toothers.andP;  From his high ground, none of these were hidden from him; if theirpasswords weren't guessable, he could steal them by setting up Trojan horses.andM;This wasn't a little desktop computer he'd broken into.andP;  He found thousandsof files on the system, and hundreds of users.andM;He commanded the air force computer to list the names of all its files; itwent merrily along typing out names like &quot;Laser-design-plans&quot; and&quot;Shuttlelaunch-manifest.&quot; But he didn't know how to shut off the spigot.andP;  Fortwo hours, it poured a Niagara of information onto his terminal.andM;Finally, at 2:30, he hung up.andP;  While the hacker stepped through the air forcecomputer, Steve White traced Tymnet's lines.andP;  I asked Steve for the details.andM;&quot;I checked with Wolfgang Hoffman at the Bundespost.andP;  Your visitor is comingfrom Karlsruhe today.andP;  The University of Karlsruhe.&quot;andM;My hacker was moving around.andP;  Or maybe he was staying in one place, playing ashell game with the telephone system.andP;  Perhaps he was a student, visitingdifferent campuses and showing off to his friends.andP;  Was I certain that therewas only one hacker-or was I watching several people?andM;Two days later, the hacker was back.andP;  He went straight over thc Milnet to theAir Force Space Division.andP;  I watched him log in as Field Service.andM;He didn't waste a minute.andP;  He went straight to the authorization software,searched for an old, unused account, and modified it, giving it systemprivileges and a new password: AFHACK.andM;AFHACK-what arrogance.andP;  He's thumbing his nose at the United States AirForce.andM;From now on, he didn't need the field service account.andP;  Disguised as anofficer in the air force, he had unlimited access to the Space Division'scomputer.andM;A call to Steve White started a trace rolling.andP;  Within five minutes, he'dtraced the connection to Hannover and called the Bundespost.andM;A few minutes of silence then: &quot;Cliff does the conandM;nection look like it will beandM;a long one?&quot;andM;&quot;I can't tell, but I think so,&quot; I said.andM;&quot;OK.&quot; Steve was on another telephone; I could hear only an occasional shout.andM;In a minute, Steve returned to my fine.andP;  &quot;Wolfgang is tracing the call inHannover.andP;  It's a local call.andP;  They're going to try to trace it all the way.&quot;andM;Here's news! A local call in Hannover meant that the hacker was somewhere inHannover.andM;Steve shouted instructions from Wolfgang: &quot;Whatever you do, don't disconnectthe hacker.andP;  Keep him on the line if you can!&quot;andM;But he's rifling files at the air force base.andP;  It was like letting a burglarrob your home while you watched.andM;He went for operational plans.andP;  Documents describing air force payloads forthe space shuttle.andP;  Test results from satellite detection systems.andP;  SDIresearch proposals.andP;  A description of an astronaut-operated camera system.andM;Tymnet came back on the I'm sorry, Cliff, but the trace in Germany isstymied.&quot;andM;&quot;Can't they trace the call?&quot; &quot;Well, the hacker's line comes from Hannover,all right,&quot; Steve replied.andP;  &quot;But Hannover's phone fines connect throughmechanical switches-noisy, complicated widgets-and these can be traced onlyby people, not by computers.&quot;andM;Another opportunity lost.andP;  I cut off the hacker's connection so that hecouldn't do more harm.andM;Later, Steve White explained that American telephones are computercontrolled, so it's pretty easy to trace them.andP;  But in Germany they needsomeone at the Hannover exchange to trace the call.andM;&quot;So we can't trace him unless the hacker calls during the day or evening?&quot; Iasked.andM;&quot;Worse than that.andP;  It'll take an hour or two to make the trace once it'sstarted.&quot;andM;Lately, the hacker had been showing up for five minutes at a time.andP;  Longenough to wake me up, but hardly enough for a two-hour trace.andP;  How could Ikeep him on for a couple of hours?andM;The answer, I realized, was disarmingly simplegive him what he wants: all theclassified data, all the top-secret information he could gather.andP;  Not forreal, of course.andP;  Instead, I'd create a phony database.andP;  Its documents woulddescribe a new Star Wars project.andP;  An outsider reading them would believethat Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories had just landed a fat government contractto manage a new computer network.andP;  The SDI Network.andM;This bogus network, which would apparently link together scores of classifiedcomputers,would extend to military bases around the world.andP;  By reading thefiles, you'd find lieutenants and colonels, scientists and engineers.andP;  Hereand there, I would drop hints of meetings and classified reports.andM;And I invented Barbara Sherwin, the sweet, bumbling secretary trying tofigure out her new word processor and keep track of the endless stream ofdocuments produced by our newly invented &quot;Strategic Defense InitiativeNetwork Office.&quot;andM;My snare was baited.andP;  If the hacker bit, he'd take two hours to swallow thebait.andP;  Long enough for the Germans to track him down.andM;The next move was the hacker's.andM;My beeper sounded at 5:14 p.m., Friday, January 16.andP;  There's the hacker.andM;It didn't take him very long to swallow the hook; soon he broke into my phonySDInet.andP;  Quickly, I got on the phone to Steve White.andM;&quot;Steve, call Germany.andP;  The hacker's on, and it'll be a long session.&quot;andM;&quot;Spot-on, Cliff.andP;  Call you back in ten minutes.&quot; For the next 45 minutes, thehacker dumped out file after file, reading all the garbage that I hadcreated.andP;  Boring, tedious ore, with an occasional nugget of technicalinformation.andM;Then he dumped the file named FORM LETTER:andM;DEAR SIR:andM;THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY ABOUT SDINET.andP;

 BARBARA SHERWINandM;DOCUMENTS SECRETARYandM;SDINET PROJECTandM;Steve White called back from Tymnet.andP;  &quot;I've traced your connection over tothe University of Bremen.andP;  And the Bundespost has traced the Datex line fromBremen into Hannover.andP;  In the past half hour, the technician traced the lineand has narrowed it down to one of 50 telephone numbers.&quot;andM;&quot;Why can't they get the actual number?&quot; &quot;Wolfgang's unclear about that.andP;  Itsounds like they've determined the number to be from a group of local phones,but the next time they make a trace, they'll zero in on the actual telephone.andO;From tile sound of Wolfgang's message, they're excited about solving thiscase.&quot;andM;The next day, at 10:17 a.m., the hacker came back.andP;  This time, he wasn'tinterested in SDI files.andP;  Instead, he went out over the Milnet, trying tobreak into military computers.andM;He was concentrating on air force and army computers, though he occasionallyknocked on the navy's door as well.andP;  Places I'd never heard of, like the AirForce Weapons Lab, Descom headquarters, Air Force CC OIS, and the CCA-amc.andO;Fifty places, all without success.andM;Then he slid across the Milnet into a computer named Buckner.andP;  He got rightin .andP;  .  .  didn't even need a password on the account named &quot;guest.&quot;andM;He'd broken into the Army Communications Center in Building 23, Room 121, ofFort Buckner.andP;  Fort Buckner was in Okinawa.andM;What a connection! From Hannover, Germany, the hacker linked to theUniversity of Bremen, across a transatlantic cable into Tymnet, then into myBerkeley computer, and into the Milnet, finally reaching Okinawa.andM;A bit after 11 in the morning, he finally grew tired and logged off.andM;While he'd circled the globe with his spiderweb of connections, the GermanBundespost had homed in on him.andM;The phone rang-had to be Steve White.andP;  &quot;Hi Cliff,&quot; Steve said, &quot;The trace iscomplete.&quot; &quot;The Germans got the guy?&quot; &quot;They know his phone number.&quot; &quot;Well,who is he?&quot; I asked.andM;&quot;They can't say right now, but you're supposed to tell the FBI.&quot;andM;&quot;Just tell me this much,&quot; I asked Steve.andP;  &quot;Is it a computer or a person?&quot;andM;&quot;A person with a computer at his home.andP;  Or should I say, at his business.&quot;andM;Days later, Tymnet passed along a chilling message: &quot;This is not a benignhacker.andP;  It is quite serious.andP;  The scope of the investigation is beingextended.andP;  Thirty people are now working on this case.andP;  Instead of simplybreaking into the apartments of one or two people, locksmiths are making keysto the houses of the hackers, and the arrests will be made when the hackerscannot destroy the evidence.andP;  These hackers are linked to the shady dealingsof a private company.&quot;andM;Throughout the spring, I kept making new bait.andP;  My mythical Barbara Sherwincreated memos and letters, requisitions and travel orders.andP;  Here and there,she sprinkled a few technical articles, explaining how the SDI networkinterconnected all sorts of classified computers.andM;On Monday, April 27, came one of the biggest shocks.andP;  A letter arrived,addressed to the imaginary Barbara Sherwin.andM;Triam International, Inc.andM;6512 Ventura DriveandM;Pittsburgh, PA 15236 April 21, 1987andM;Dear Mrs.andP;  Sherwin:andM;I am interested in the following documents.andP;  Please send me a price list andan update on SDI Network Project.andP;  Thank you for your cooperation.andM;Very truly yours,andM;Laszlo J.andP;  BaloghandM;Balogh then asked for every phony document I had made up in the file calledFORM LETTER.andM;Someone had swallowed the bait and was asking for more information! I couldunderstand it if the letter came from Hannover.andP;  But Pittsburgh?andM;I called Mike Gibbons at the Alexandria FBI office and told him about it.andM;&quot;OK,&quot; Mike said.andP;  &quot;Listen up carefully.andP;  Don't touch that letter.andO;Especially, don't touch around the edges.andP;  Go find a glassine envelope.andO;Gently insert the paper in the envelope.andP;  Then express mail it to me.andO;Whatever you do, don't handle it.andP;  Wear gloves if you must.&quot;andM;This sounded like Dick Tracy's &quot;Crimestoppers,&quot; but I followed orders.andM;A hacker in Hannover, Germany, learns a secret from Berkeley, California.andO;Three months later, a Hungarian named Laszlo Balogh living in Pittsburghwrites us a letter.andP;  What's happening here? Tuesday moming, June 23, MikeGibbons called from the FBI.andM;&quot;You can close up shop, Cliff.&quot; &quot;What's happened?&quot; &quot;Arrest warrants wereissued this morning at IO.&quot; &quot;Anyone arrested?&quot; &quot;I can't say.&quot; Something washappening.andP;  But Mike wouldn't say what.andM;A few hours later, Wolfgang Hoffman sent a message: &quot;An apartment and acompany were searched, and nobody was home at the time.andP;  Printouts, disks,and tapes were seized and will be analyzed in the next few days.andP;  Expect nofurther break-ins.&quot;andM;Finally, it was over.andP;  The FBI still wasn't talking, but I managed to fmd outwho the Germans had fingered; I could now attach a name to the shadowy hackerI had chased across two continents: Markus Hess.andM;So what really happened? Was Hess working alone, or was he in league withothers? And why was he breaking into defense department computers? Here's myestimate, based on interviews, police reports, newspaper accounts, andmessages from German computer programmers.andM;In the mid-1980s, a dozen hackers started the Chaos Computer Club, whosemembers specialized in creating viruses, breaking into computers, and servingas a computer counterculture.andP;  Through electronic bulletin boards andtelephone links, they anonymously exchanged phone numbers of hackedcomputers, as well as stolen passwords and credit cards.andM;Markus Hess knew of the Chaos Club, although he was never a central figurethere.andP;  Rather, he kept his distance as a freelance hacker.andP;  During thc day,he worked at a small software firm in downtown Hannover.andM;Over a crackling phone connection, an astronomer friend in Hannover explainedto me, &quot;You see, Hess knew Hagbard, who kept in touch with other hackers inGermany, Eke Pengo and Frimp.andP;  Hagbard is a pseudonym, of course, his realname is .andP;  .  .  &quot;andM;Hagbard.andP;  I'd heard that name before-he'd broken into Fermilab and Stanford.andM;Hagbard worked closely with Markus Hess.andP;  The two drank beers together atHannover bars and spent evenings behind Hess's computer.andM;Apparently, Hess apparently just played around the networks at first,searching for ways to connect around the world.andP;  Like a ham-radio operator,he started out a hobbyist, trying to reach as far away as possible.andP;  In thebeginning, he managed to connect to Karlsruhe; later he reached Bremen overthe Datex network.andM;Soon he discovered that many system managers hadn't locked their back doors.andO;Usually these were university computers, but Markus Hess began to wonder: howmany other systems were wide open? What other ways could you sneak intocomputers?andM;By September 1985, Hagbard and Pengo were routinely breaking into computersin North America: mostly high energy physics labs, but a few NASA sites aswell.andP;  Excitedly, Hagbard described his exploits to Hess.andM;Hess began to explore outside of Germany.andP;  But he no longer cared aboutuniversities and physics laboratories-he wanted some real excitement.andP;  Hessnow targeted the military.andM;The leaders of the Chaos Computer Club had issued a warning to their members:&quot;Never penetrate a military computer.andP;  The security people on the other sidewill be playing a game with youalmost like chess.andP;  Remember that they'vepracticed this game for a long time.andP;  .  .  .  &quot; Markus Hess wasn'tlistening.andM;Hess apparently found his way into an unprotected computer belonging to aGerman subsidiary of U.S.andP;  defense contractor Mitre.andP;  Once inside thatsystem, he discovered detailed instructions to link into Mitre's computers inBedford, Massachusetts, and McLean, Virginia.andM;By summer 1986, Hess and Hagbard were operating separately but frequentlycomparing notes.andP;  Meanwhile, Hess worked in Hannover, programming VAXcomputers and managing several systems.andM;Hess soon expanded his beachhead at Mitre.andP;  He explored the systeminternally, then sent out tentacles into other American computers.andP;  Hecollected telephone numbers and network addresses and methodically attackedthese systems.andP;  On August 20, he struck Lawrence Berkeley Labs.andM;Even then, Hess was only fooling around.andP;  He'd realized that he was privy tosecrets, both industrial and national, but kept his mouth shut.andP;  Then, aroundthe end of September, in a smoky Hannover beergarden, he described his latestexploit to Hagbard.andM;Hagbard smelled money.andP;  And Hagbard knew who to contact: Pengo, in WestBerlin.andM;Pengo, with his contacts to hackers across Germany, knew how to use Hess'sinformation.andP;  Carrying Hess's printouts, one of the Berlin hackers crossedinto East Berlin and met with agents from the East GermanStaatssicherheitsdienst-the Secret Service.andM;The deal was.andP;  made: around 30,000 deutschemarks-$18,000-for printouts andpasswords.andM;From there, who knows what happened to the information? The East GermanSecret Service cooperates closely with the Soviet KGB; surely theStaatssicherheitsdienst would tell the KGB about this new form of espionage.andM;The KGB wasn't just paying for printouts, though.andP;  Hess and companyapparently sold their techniques as well: how to break into VAX computers;which networks to use when crossing the Atlantic; details on how the Milnetoperates.andM;Even more important to the KGB was obtaining research data about Westerntechnology, including integrated circuit design, computer-aidedmanufacturing, and, especially, operating system software that was under U.S.andO;export control.andP;  They offered 250,000 deutschemarks for copies of DigitalEquipment's VMS operating system.andM;According to the German television station NDR, the Berlin hackers suppliedmuch of this order, including source code to the Unix operating systemdesigns for high-speed gallium-arsenide integrated circuits, and computerprograms used to engineer computer memory chips.andP;  Hagbard wanted more thanmoney.andP;  He demanded coandM;caine.andP;  The East German Secret Service was a willing supplier.andM;Hagbard passed some of the money (but none of the cocaine) to Hess in retumfor printouts, passwords, and network information.andP;  Hagbard's cut went towardpaying his telephone bill which sometimes ran over $1,000 a month as hecalled computers around the world.andM;Hess saved everything.andP;  He kept a detailed notebook and saved every sessionon a floppy disk.andP;  This way, after he disconnected from a military computer,he could print out the interesting parts and pass these along to Hagbard andon to the KGB.andM;Also on the KGB's wish list was SDI data.andP;  As Hess searched for it, Inaturally detected SDI showing up in his requests.andP;  And I had fed Hess plentyof SDI fodder.andM;But could the East Germans (or KGB?) trust these printouts? How could they besure Hagbard wasn't inventing all of this to feed his own coke habit?andM;The KGB decided to verify the German hacker ring.andP;  The mythical BarbaraSherwin served as a perfect way to test the validity of this new form ofespionage.andP;  She had, after all, invited people to write to her for moreinformation.andM;But secret services don't handle things directly.andP;  They use intermediaries.andO;The East Germans (KGB?) contacted another agency-either the Hungarian orBulgarian intelligence service.andP;  They, in tum, apparently had a professionalrelationship with a contact in Pittsburgh: Laszlo Balogh.andM;Does the FBI have enough evidence to indict Laszlo Balogh? They won't tellme.andP;  But the way I see it, Laszlo's in deep trouble: the FBI is watching him,and whoever's pulling his puppet strings isn't pleased.andM;The West German police, though, have plenty of evidence against Markus Hess.andO;Printouts, phone traces, and my logbook.andP;  When they broke into his apartmenton June 29, 1987, they seized a hundred floppy disks, a computer, anddocumentation describing the U.S.andP;  Milnet.andM;But when the police raided Hess's apartment, nobody was home.andP;  Though I waswaiting patiently for him to appear on my computer, the German police enteredhis place when he wasn't connected.andM;At his first trial, Hess got off on appeal.andP;  His lawyer argued that sinceHess wasn't connected at the moment his apartment was raided, he might nothave done the hacking.andP;  This, along with a problem in the search warrants,was enough to overtum the case against Hess on computer theft.andP;  But theGerman federal police continued to investigate.andM;On March 2, 1989, German authorities charged five people with espionage:Pengo, Hagbard, Peter Carl, Dirk Bresinsky, and Markus Hess.andM;Peter Carl met regularly with KGB agents in East Berlin, selling any data theothers could find.andP;  When the German officials caught up with him, he wasabout to run off to Spain.andP;  He's now in jail, waiting for trial, along withDirk Bresinsky, who was jailed for desertion from the German army.andM;Pengo is having second thoughts about his years working for the KGB.andP;  He saysthat he hopes he &quot;did the right thing by giving the German police detailedinformation about my involvement.&quot; But as long as there's an active criminalcase, he'll say no more.andM;All the same, the publicity hasn't helped Pengo's professional life as acomputer consultant.andP;  His business partners have shied away from backing him,and several of his computing projects have been canceled.andP;  Outside of hisbusiness losses, I'm not sure that he feels there's anything wrong with whathe did.andM;Today, Markus Hess is walking the streets of Hannover, free on bail whileawaiting a trial for espionage.andM;Hagbard, who hacked with Hess for a year, tried to kick his cocaine habit inlate 1988.andP;  But not before spending his profits from the KGB: he was deep indebt and without a job.andP;  In spring 1989 he found a job at the office of apolitical party in Hannover.andP;  By cooperating with the police, he and Pengoavoided prosecution for espionage.andM;Hagbard was last seen alive on May 23, 1989.andP;  In an isolated forest outsideof Hannover, police found his chaffed bones next to a melted can of gasoline.andO;A borrowed car was parked nearby, keys still in the ignition.andM;No suicide note was found.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
