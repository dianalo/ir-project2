In 1986,for the first time, the global production of crude oil and natural liquidsexceeded new reserves added. Proved oil reserves at the end of 1985 stood707.6 billion bbl (BBO), but declined to 703.1 BBO by the end of 1986.The 1986 reserve decrease, 4.5 BBO, was 20.4% of total global productionof 22.0 BBO. This handwriting on the wall is very bad news. The world'srecoverable crude oil and natural gas liquids discovered through 1985totaled 1258 BBO, including cumulative production of 551 BBO and 707BBO of reserves. At current production rates, half of all discoveredoil will have been burned up by 1989. Timing of the end of our oil agecan be extrapolated from a modified Hubbert curve, with future productionresembling a mirror image of past production. The watershed beginningof the inevitable decline in global crude oil supplies can be expectedin the late 1990s, although the date may be over 30 years later in somesuper-oily Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Clearlythe day of reckoning will be postponed by any new oil discoveries. Thesewill probably be distributed much as are the present global reserves(e.g., 68% OPEC; 11% USSR and China; 21% rest of world). Of this 56%will be in the Persian Gulf area. Giant fields (more than 0.5 BBO reserves)contain 75% of the world's reserves. Discoveries of oil in the globe's320 known giant fields peaked at 125 BBO during the period 1961-1965,after which giant field discoveries plunged to only 10 BBO during 1981-1985.Henceforth, they should expect to find few giant whales (but many minnows)in the non-OPEC world's fished-out basins. Every new field will helpas global crude oil supplies dwindle. Therefore, it is essential thatall large prospects outside the Persian Gulf be tested promptly, so theoil-importing nations will known what size of non-OPEC reserves are available.</TEXT></DOC>
