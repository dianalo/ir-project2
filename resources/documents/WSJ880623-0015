Sease and David Wilson </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   A soaring dollar and a favorable inflation report boosted stock prices to a post-crash high.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 43.03 to close at 2152.20, substantially above the previous post-crash high of 2131.40 set June 15. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was strong at 217.5 million shares. Advancing issues on the Big Board outstripped losers 1,144 to 413.    The lion's share of the price gains yesterday came at the opening bell after the dollar had gained sharply in overseas trading and the government had reported that durable-goods orders for May fell 2.2%. The U.S. currency continued to gain in U.S. trading, and investors saw the durable-goods report as evidence that inflationary pressures are easing. Most estimates of the May report called for a 2% increase in orders.    Traders said the dollar's gains prompted foreign investors to buy U.S. stocks after several months of absence from the U.S. market. &quot;People are looking to move assets back into the American market,&quot; said Ed Shopkorn, director of institutional equities at Mabon Nugent andamp; Co.    At one point yesterday the rally pushed the Dow Jones industrials up more than 50 points, triggering the Big Board's restriction on the use of its automated order delivery system for stock-index arbitrage trading. Futures-related buy programs played a big role in the market's early gains yesterday.    Mr. Shopkorn said the rally in the dollar could be just what the market needs to advance decisively beyond the upper limit of its trading range since the crash. &quot;Foreigners have essentially avoided our market since October. You get some foreign buying here, and you will spook American money managers back into this market,&quot; he said.    But other market professionals remain skeptical. &quot;It's a mood-type rally in that you have this era of good feelings coming out of Toronto,&quot; said Don Yarling, a partner in the Chicago money-management firm of Lemley-Yarling. &quot;Our feeling is that the market is entering a speculative area. It's still tending to pin its hopes on ephemeral things like soybeans and feelings about Ronald Reagan.&quot;    David J. Mulanaphy, a portfolio manager at HT Investors, Providence, R.I., said the values available in stocks during the past few months have diminished. &quot;The biggest problem we've had here is finding names to buy. The market is not all that cheap,&quot; he said.    Accordingly, he plans to maintain the current 10% to 15% cash levels in his firm's portfolios and may even raise more cash by selling consumer stocks, which he dislikes because of the potential for a slowdown in the consumer sector of the economy.    Nevertheless, Mr. Mulanaphy added that the summer rally that many investors have been expecting may already be under way. He said the Dow Jones industrials are likely to reach the 2400 level during the summer months as the market receives a boost from second-quarter earnings reports, which he expects to be strong.    International Business Machines, which jumped 3 1/8 points Tuesday after its introduction of the Silverlake line of mid-range computers, surged another 2 3/4 to 123.    Several other blue-chip issues also moved solidly higher. Du Pont soared 4 3/8 to 92 3/4, Westinghouse Electric climbed 1 3/8 to 56 1/8, Boeing gained 1 3/4 to 57 7/8, International Paper rose 1 7/8 to 48 1/4, F.W. Woolworth advanced 1 1/8 to 54 3/8, Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing gained 1 1/2 to 65, and Aluminum Co. of America went up 1 3/8 to 53 1/4.    Technology stocks generally firmed along with IBM. Digital Equipment rose 1 7/8 to 112 3/8, Cray Research gained 1 to 87 1/2, Compaq Computer climbed 2 to 62 1/2, Unisys rose 7/8 to 37 1/8, Texas Instruments gained 1 to 50, and Motorola went up 1 to 53 7/8.    There were, however, two notable decliners among computer issues: Honeywell, which dropped 4 to 70 5/8, and Hewlett-Packard, which fell 2 5/8 to 51 7/8. Honeywell said its second-quarter earnings will be below the $53 million, or $1.21 a share, of a year ago because of a $23 million charge for cost overruns and writedowns in its military avionics group. Hewlett-Packard told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that it couldn't explain the drop, but analysts said it may have reflected concerns that the Silverlake computers will cut into sales of the company's Spectrum line.    Hospital-supply stocks were also left out of the market's surge. Merrill Lynch lowered its investment rating on five issues in the group, the investor report said. They included Johnson andamp; Johnson, which fell 1 1/8 to 79 3/8; Abbott Laboratories, which gained 1/2 to 45 1/4; Baxter International, which eased 1/4 to 21 1/2; Becton Dickinson, which fell 1 to 52; and C.R. Bard, which rose 1/8 to 40 1/4.    Fort Howard, which said a management group intends to develop a buyout proposal along with certain unnamed third parties, soared 8 1/8 to 48 3/8.    Irving Bank dropped 1 to 70 3/8. Bank of New York said it would withdraw its sweetened cash-and-stock takeover offer for the company unless Irving accepts the bid by noon Eastern time Thursday. Bank of New York rose 3/8 to 33 3/4.    Payless Cashways eased 1/2 to 23 1/8 on news that a group that includes investor Asher Edelman reduced its stake to 8.1% from 9.1%. Meanwhile, the group said it asked the company's board to furnish it with financial data already given to a management group that is considering a leveraged buy-out. The Edelman group has said it may make an alternative offer.    National Intergroup fell 3/8 to 17. The company decided to omit its quarterly common stock dividend of 6 1/4 cents a share because of restrictions in its loan agreements.    The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.71 to 308.59. Volume totaled 15,160,000 shares, up from 10,154,000 yesterday. There were 362 issues advancing, 229 declining and 265 unchanged.    Larizza Industries gained 1 1/8 to 14 1/8. The company said it has retained Morgan Stanley to explore the possible sale of the company and other &quot;strategic alternatives.&quot;    On the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index went up 2.78 to 390.53. Advancers topped decliners 1,198 to 864.    Metropolitan Federal Savings andamp; Loan fell 4 to 18 after First Tennessee National terminated an agreement to acquire the thrift in a stock swap. Metropolitan also said it expects to post a fiscal-fourth-quarter loss, compared with net income of 71 cents a share a year ago, because of a special addition to its loan-loss reserve. First Tennessee rose 3/8 to 25 5/8. </TEXT></DOC>
