The facility is located in Somervell County,Texas, approximately 40 miles southwest of Fort Worth, Texas. This supplementpresents the staff's evaluation of the applicant's Corrective ActionProgram (CAP) related to the mechanical, civil/structural, electrical,instrumentation and control (Iandamp;C), and heating, ventilation, and airconditioning (HVAC) disciplines. This supplement only addresses the systemsportion of HVAC. Other aspects of HVAC (e.g., duct and supports) arecovered in another supplement. The scope and methodologies for theseCAP workscopes, as summarized in project status reports and as detailedin related documents referenced in this evaluation, were developed toresolve various design issues raised by the Comanche Peak Response Team(CPRT), CYGNA Energy Services (CYGNA), and the NRC staff. The NRC staffconcludes that the CAP workscopes for mechanical, civil/structural, electrical,Iandamp;C, and HVAC systems provide a comprehensive program for resolving theassociated technical concerns identified by the CPRT, CYGNA, and theNRC staff and their implementation ensures that the design of relatedsystems, structures, and components at CPSES satisfies the applicablerequirements of 10 CFR Part 50.</TEXT></DOC>
