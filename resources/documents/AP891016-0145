Andries Treurnicht of the segregationist Conservative Party, whowon 31 percent of the white vote in last month's parliamentaryelections, said the government had undermined its own ban on theAfrican National Congress guerrilla movement by freeing seven ANCleaders unconditionally.   The seven, at a news conference after their release Sunday, saidthey would intensify pressure on the government to legalize theANC, lift the state of emergency and release all politicalprisoners as preconditions for talks.   Anti-apartheid groups said Monday that 71 people remaineddetained without charge nationwide and that six of them had begun ahunger strike to press for their release.   Treurnicht, in a statement, said: ``Either the governmentdispossesses us (whites) of our country ... by giving in to the ANCultimatum, or the government disallows further demonstrations andrejects all radical claims which will disturb the peace, destroyfreedom and land the country in a situation of chaos and conflict.''   The seven ANC leaders, freed along with a member of a smallerguerrilla group, kept a low profile Monday after their emotionalnews conference Sunday.   Walter Sisulu, the highest-ranking of the group and a closefriend of jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela, spent most of the dayat his home in Soweto. He emerged at one point to greet severalhundred schoolchildren gathered outside, telling them they shouldwork hard at school and maintain discipline in their politicalactivities.   The only freed prisoners not aligned to the ANC, Jafta Masemola,held a news conference in Pretoria to convey the position of hisorganization, the Pan Africanist Congress.   He said his group, unlike the ANC, opposed negotiations with thegovernment because it doubted blacks could gain power this way. Hesaid anti-government violence remained one of his group's tactics.   The ANC's 28-year-old campaign of sabotage and bombings hasvirtually ceased in recent months, although Sisulu and hiscolleagues said they still support the principle of violentresistance.   ``We're not concerned about rhetoric,'' said Con Botha, aspokesman for the governing National Party, when asked about thefreed prisoners' remarks.   In the past, the government has said it would include the ANC innegotiations only if its leaders repudiated violence. But SouthAfrica's ambassador to Britain, Rae Killen, was quoted innewspapers Monday as telling a British radio interviewer there nolonger were any preconditions.   The state South African Broadcasting Corp., in a commentary,said the ANC's concept of armed struggle ``belongs to a pastpolitical era.''   ``Today, the doors are open to all political leaders who arewilling to take part in peaceful, democratic action,'' it said.``Participation in the negotiation process must be comprehensive,involving authentic leaders of constituencies across the politicalspectrum, from left to right.''   The prisoner releases were approved by President F.W. de Klerkas part of his attempt to launch negotiations on a new constitutionthat will extend political rights to blacks. He envisions anarrangement that protects white interests and avoids black-majorityrule.   The 28 million blacks now have no vote in national affairs,which are dominated by the 5 million whites.   All but one of the eight freed prisoners served at least 25years in jail. Five, including Sisulu, were sentenced to lifeprison terms in 1964, along with Mandela, for plottinganti-government sabotage.   Mandela, 71, remains imprisoned, although his release is widelyexpected within months.</TEXT></DOC>
