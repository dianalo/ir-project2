Trade disputes planted the seeds of two wars and repeatedly turned 19th-century politics into a barroom brawl.    Unfortunately, the defenders of free trade were far more eloquent in the past than they are today.    Few people realize that restrictive trade policies were a major cause of the American Revolution. In 1750, Britain prohibited Americans from erecting any mill for rolling or slitting iron; William Pitt exclaimed, &quot;It is forbidden to make even a nail for a horseshoe.&quot; The Declaration of Indpendence denounced King George for &quot;cutting off our trade with all parts of the world.&quot;    In 1789, the new Congress passed its first tariff -- mainly to raise revenue, but also to temporarily protect &quot;infant industries.&quot; Criticism of the protectionist tariffs was muted because the tariffs were scheduled to expire in 1796.    In 1821, a congressional Committee on Manufactures released a report asserting &quot;that commerce is exporting, not importing,&quot; and &quot;the excess of exports over imports is the rate of profit&quot; -- the same gems of logic that inspire today's protectionists.    John Taylor, a senator from Virginia, in a fiery reply to the congressional report entitled &quot;Tyranny Unmasked,&quot; wrote: &quot;All monopolies and exclusive privileges {for protecting domestic manufacturers} have succeeded by using the same argument. It is invariably condensed in the single word 'reciprocity'. . . . It would be exactly the case of a pacific war, in which the nations should make laws that neither should attack the other, but that each should shed at home a reciprocal portion of its own blood.&quot;    In 1827, a Committee of the Citizens of Boston warned, &quot;Let it never be forgotten, that the question . . . is not so much what may be beneficial to manufacturers, as whether government has a right to benefit these, to the manifest injury both of the agricultural and commercial classes.&quot;    In 1828, Congress passed the &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot; -- a crushing, heavy tariff that explicitly sacrificed one part of the country to another part -- and set the South on fire. Northern manufacturers got almost all the benefits of protection, while Southern farmers were forced to pay higher prices for comparatively inferior American products and lost their cotton export markets because of foreign retaliation against the U.S.    In 1832, Congress upped the tariff still higher. South Carolina declared the new tariff unconstitutional and thereby null -- and busied itself buying cannon and signing up volunteers to defend its state's rights. Congress backed down and lowered the tariffs, but the tariff battle bitterly alienated the North and South and paved the way for the Civil War.    To finance the Civil War, the Republican Party imposed heavy tariffs -- and then kept the tariffs after the war to protect domestic industry. As Joseph S. Moore of the Council for Tariff Reform proclaimed in 1877, &quot;Is it not a shame and an outrage -- I may say a crime -- that a fever-sick family should have to pay a tax on their medicines to three or four people who are already millionaires?&quot;    Rep. Frank H. Hurd declared in 1881, &quot;It is beyond the sphere of true governmental power to tax one man to help the business of another. . . . This is robbery, nothing more nor less.&quot;    William G. Sumner, a Yale professor, proclaimed, &quot;The protectionist, instead of creating a new industry, has simply taken one industry and set it as a parasite to live upon another.&quot; And popular writer Henry George observed: &quot;What are really infant industries have no more chance in the struggle for government encouragement than infant pigs have with full-grown swine about a meal tub. . . . To introduce a tariff bill into Congress is like throwing a banana into a cage of monkeys. No sooner is it proposed to protect one industry than all industries begin to screech and scramble for it.&quot;    Nowadays, free traders are accused of being Japanese apologists, whereas in the previous century they were known to be &quot;secret agents of British influence.&quot; Nowadays, American workers must be &quot;protected&quot; against Third World starvation pay scales, while a hundred years ago the great danger was &quot;the pauper labor of Europe.&quot; Then, protectionists talked about &quot;fair trade,&quot; &quot;reciprocity&quot; and countervailing penalties; nowadays . . . . Progress is a wonderful thing.    ---   Mr. Bovard has assaulted government profligacy in previous Journal articles. </TEXT></DOC>
