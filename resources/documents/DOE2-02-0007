Theanalysis was carried out by means of a realistic three-resonances pionform factor model. The latter is based on minimally simplified analyticstructure of the pion form factor, reflects its other well-establishedproperties and depends just on physical parameters. The validity of themodel isovector {pi}{pi} scattering amplitude at the experimentally measurableregion. 2 figs.; 9 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
