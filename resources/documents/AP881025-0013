Responding to North's motions to dismiss charges he lied abouthis covert assistance of Nicaraguan rebels, prosecutors said theformer White House aide's arguments are ``incompatible with theaspirations of our system of government'' and ``inconsistent withany but the most jaundiced view of the realities of politics andgovernment.''   The spirited attack on North was offered Monday by independentcounsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who consented to a defense motion todismiss a charge that the former Marine officer and NationalSecurity Council aide obstructed an investigation of who paid for a$13,800 security fence outside his house.   Lawyers for the retired Marine lieutenant colonel said anyalleged fabrication of documents in December 1986 to concealpayments for the fence by arms dealer Richard V. Secord wasn'tobstruction of justice because the Iran-Contra grand jury did notbegin its work for another month.   While conceding a legal deficiency in one of 16 charges againstNorth, Walsh's office urged the court to reject a series of defensemotions to dismiss other counts of the indictment.   Prosecutors disclosed new details about North's destruction ofkey National Security Council documents in November 1986 as theIran-Contra affair was unraveling.   North destroyed original copies of so-called ``System IV''documents at the National Security Council that prosecutors called``the most sensitive records in the NSC's carefully constructedsystem of document control.''   There is also evidence he purposely withheld from NSC filesoriginal copies of documents that were the ``sole record of theevents and activities described therein,'' prosecutors said.   They also ridiculed North's defense that he was not warned thatlying to Congress in unsworn statements could result in criminalprosecution.   The defense had claimed that North was the first governmentofficial to be prosecuted for alleged falsehoods in unswornstatements to lawmakers.   North's lawyers recounted a history of lies to Congress by topgovernment officials, including Secretary of State John FosterDulles' false denial of CIA involvement in a 1958 plot to overthrowIndonesian President Sukarno.   Prosecutors said such a rebuttal ``reflects a shocking andcynical view of the relations between the people's electedrepresentatives in Congress and officials of the executive branch.''   North's defense, in effect, is an argument that ``lying is soingrained and pervasive a practice in Washington that _ despitelaws clearly making it a crime for ordinary non-office-holdingcitizens to make false statements to government agencies _executive officers lack fair notice that there is not an implicitexception putting them above such laws,'' prosecutors said inpapers filed in U.S. District Court.   Among the charges against North is that he drafted false lettersin 1985 to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence anda House Foreign Affairs subcommittee.   North also is charged with making similarly false statementsduring a 1986 briefing to members of the intelligence committee.   The three 1985 letters, which were signed by then-nationalsecurity advisor Robert C. McFarlane, falsely stated that North andother National Security Council officers were not involved in anycovert efforts to raise money to arm the Contras.   McFarlane has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges ofwithholding information from Congress about covert Contra aid bysending the letters and in testimony in 1986.   The congressional queries were made following news reportslinking North to covert assistance to the Contras at a time suchaid was banned by the Boland Amendment.   ``North responded with calculated falsehood, intending to derailfurther investigation and generally succeeding,'' prosecutors saidof charges that the former NSC aide drafted letters that falselydenied his involvement in covert aid and fund-raising.   ``North could foresee that, when the committees received falsedenials and explanations which he intended to offer them, theirpredictable responses would be to cease further inquiries in thisarea,'' prosecutors said.   ``North himself was enabled to continue his secret support ofthe Contras, which culminated in the illegal corruption of the Iraninitiative,'' prosecutors said, referring to charges that Northconspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to theContras.   Prosecutors dismissed North's argument that the diversion wasnot illegal on the ground that the government weapons had becomethe property of Secord and his former partner, Albert Hakim, whenthey were sold to Iran.   Secord, a co-defendant along with Hakim and former nationalsecurity adviser John Poindexter, was a ``sham middleman,'' in a``classic fraud,'' prosecutors said.   Separate trials have been ordered for each defendant. No datehas been set for North's trial to begin.</TEXT></DOC>
