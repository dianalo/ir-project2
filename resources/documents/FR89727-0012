It was discovered on the north slopeof Chinsegut Hill in Hernando County, Florida, by John K. Small and Mrs.Raymond Robins in the spring of 1924 and was named <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> by Small (1926), who later transferred theplant to his new genus <T3>Rotantha</T3> (Small 1933). Shetler (1963) returned the plant to <T3>Campanula </T3>while noting that it was possibly a Eurasian speciesthat had been introduced, perhaps accidentally, to Chinsegut Hill. Fieldwork in the 1980's by Nancy Morin (Missouri Botanical Garden), Steven Leonard(Florida Natural Areas Inventory), Stanwyn Shetler (Smithsonian Institution),and others showed that the plant is not restricted to moist areas on ChinsegutHill, but is primarily found on moist ground at the edges of two pondsnear the hill. Now that the bellflower's habitat is better known, it hasbecome apparent that the plant is a native, narrowly endemic species (R.P.Wunderlin, University of South Florida, personal communication 1985; N.Morin, personal communication 1987).<T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> is an annual herb with a slender taproot andslender, 4-angled stems 1 to 15 centimeters (0.4 to 6.0 inches) tall. Thelargest leaves are at the base of the plant, ovate to elliptic, about 6millimeters (0.24 inch) long, and 5 millimeters wide. Leaves farther upthe stem are narrower and shorter. Many of the flowers are cleistogamous(closed, self-pollinating) and inconspicuous. The chasmogamous (open, cross-pollinating)flowers are solitary with the sepals 1.0 to 2.5 millimeters (0.04 to 0.10inch) long and the deep purple bell-shaped corolla 7 to 8 millimeters (0.28to 0.31 inch) wide. Flowering is in March and April. The seeds are thesmallest recorded for the North American members of <T3>Campanula</T3> (Shetler and Morin 1986). The only other bellflowerin Florida is <T3>Campanula floridana,</T3> a widespread species with shorter sepalsand a longer corolla (Perkins 1979, Wunderlin <T3>et al.</T3> 1980a, Wunderlin 1982). <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> is one of a number of low plants that occupythe edges of ponds; its abundance apparently fluctuates considerably fromyear to year depending on water levels. The ponds are adjacent to pasturesgrazed by cattle.<T3>Justicia colleyi,</T3> Cooley's water-willow, is a member of the acanthusfamily (Acanthaceae). Specimens were collected in 1924 and 1934 by JohnK. Small and colleagues and in 1957 by George Cooley. Monachino and Leonard(1959) recognized these specimens as a new species, <T3>Justicia cooleyi,</T3> distinct from the two other native water-willowsin central Florida. Meagher (1974) confirmed this view. <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> is a rhizomatous perennial herb with upright,quadrangular stems and is usually less than 40 centimeters (16 inches)tall. The leaves are up to 5 centimeters (2 inches) long. The flowers areborne on forked, zigzag branches slightly longer than the leaves. The petalsare fused into a two-lipped corolla with the lower lip slightly longer,7 to 8 millimeters (0.28 to 0.31 inch) long. The lower lip is mottled lavenderand white. The rest of the corolla is bright lavender-rose. Flowering occursfrom August to December. A capsule 1.2 centimeters (0.47 inch) long developsfrom the flower (Kral 1983, Perkins 1979).The first collection of this water-willow was made in a ``low hammock''or hardwood forest near Mascotte in Lake County. All subsequent collectionshave been from north central Hernando County on sand to clay soils thatrange from moist to seasonally wet. Some sites are on low rises in wethammocks or swamps; most are on uplands or hills with trees such as southernmagnolia, black gum, sweetgum, live oak, laurel oak, pignut hickory, cabbagepalm, flowering dogwood, and yaupon holly. The understory may contain manyferns, woodland grasses, and sedges. The area has long attracted botanists(Rollins and Howard 1987).The extensive outcrops of limestone rock and the sinkholes in the HernandoCounty forests are unusual in the Florida peninsula and provide excellenthabitat for ferns, including the tropical hammock fern (<T3>Blechnum occidentale</T3>), and the dwarf spleenwort (<T3>Asplenium pumilum</T3>), both considered endangered by the State. Theterrestrial nodding-cap orchids <T3>Triphora latifolia</T3> and <T3>Triphora craigheadii</T3> are both endemic to hardwood forests in thispart of Florida. Both are listed as threatened by the State and are candidatesfor Federal listing. Florida crabgrass (<T3>Digitaria floridana</T3>), and non-weedy endemic species that is acandidate for Federal listing, also occurs in these forests (data fromFlorida Natural Areas Inventory, September 1987).Portions of the hardwood forests have been cleared for pastures. Selectivecutting of trees for timber or to improve grazing for livestock probablydoes not adversely affect <T3>Justicia cooleyi,</T3> which is known to occur on a periodically mowedhighway right-of-way (Kral 1983, file reports from The Nature Conservancyand the Florida Natural Areas Inventory; Wunderlin et al. 1980b). The presently known localities for both <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> and <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> are on a portion of the Brooksville Ridge, aregion with ``the most irregular surface to be found in any area of comparablesize in peninsular Florida'' (White 1970). The region has few surface streams,most drainage being to ponds and praries and into sinkholes. Phosphatemining occurred in the area in the past; today, large limestone quarriesproduce both soft and hard rock, and cattle pasturing is widespread. Also,residential development is increasing in the area. <T3>Liatris ohlingerae,</T3> scrub blazing star, is a perennial herb ofthe aster family (Asteraceae, also known as Compositae). It was first collectedin 1922 in Highlands County, Florida, by John K. Small; it was also collectedin 1922, southeast of Frostproof, Polk County, Florida, by Mrs. F.E. Ohlinger.Blake (1923) placed the plant in the blazing star genus, naming it <T3>Lacinaria ohlingerae,</T3> with the Frostproof site as the type locality.Small (1924) created a new genus for this plant, which became <T3>Ammopursus ohlingerae.</T3> Robinson (1934) reinstated scrub blazingstar in the large genus of the blazing stars as <T3>Liatris ohlingerae,</T3> changing the genus name in keeping with adoptionof <T3>Liatris</T3> as a conserved name under the International Code of BotanicalNomenclature. Gaiser's (1946) treatment of <T3>Liatris</T3> and Cronquist's (1980) floristic treatment of the asterfamily in the Southeast retain this plant in the genus <T3>Liatris,</T3> although Lakela (1964) argued in favor of reinstating<T3>Ammopursus</T3> as a genus of only one species. Cronquist gives threecommon names for <T3>Liatris:</T3> blazing star, gay feather, and button snakeroot. Membersof the genus that are sold as cut flowers or as garden perennials are usuallycalled blazing stars. Wunderlin et al. (1980c) mention ``sand torch'' asa name for <T3>Liatris ohlingerae.</T3> <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> is an erect, usually unbranched perennial herb,up to 1 meter (3 feet) tall. The leaves are very narrow, only 1 to 2.5millimeters (0.04 to 0.10 inches) wide. The several flower heads are usuallyseparated from each other on the stem; they are large compared to the restof the genus, up to 2 centimeters (0.8 inch) broad and 3 centimeters (1.2inch) from base to tips of the flowers. The flowers are bright pinkishpurple. The plant flowers from July through September and October (Kral1983). <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> has been collected frequently because of itsbrilliant flowers. A study of the central Florida sand pine scrub by Christman(1988) shows 93 known localities for the plant (71 of them in HighlandsCounty), with a geographic range from Lake Blue near Auburndale and CatfishCreek (north of Highway 60 east of Lake Wales) in Polk County (N. Bissett,The Natives, Davenport, Florida, personal communications 1988), south alongthe Lake Wales Ridge (and U.S. Highway 27) through Sebring to the ArchboldBiological Station in Highlands County. The distribution of <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> overlaps or encompasses the distributions of10 federally listed plants of the scrub habitat, and it parallels especiallyclosely the distributions of <T3>Hypericum cumulicola</T3> (endangered), <T3>Polygonella basiramia</T3> (endangered), and <T3>Prunus geniculata </T3> (endangered). A site at Archbold BiologicalStation is protected; a site as Saddle Blanket Lakes is being purchasedby the State. A small site may be added to Highlands Hammock State Park.Sites in Arbuckle State Park and the adjoining Arbuckle State Forest (bothrecently acquired) are protected. <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> is restricted to sand pine scrub vegetation,a vegetation that is restricted to Florida and has its greatest floristicrichness on the Lake Wales Ridge. Scrub vegetation occurs on excessivelydrained sand soils, usually on sites that, under presettlement conditions,were provided a degree of natural fire protection by a nearby lake or swamp(Christman 1988). Scrub vegetation is dominated by evergreen shrubs includingoaks (such as the endemic <T3>Quercus inopina</T3>), with variable numbers of sand pine (<T3>Pinus clausa</T3>). Sandy open spaces between large shrubs are occupiedby small shrubs such as <T3>Conradina brevifolia</T3> and <T3>Dicerandra frutescens</T3> (both members of the mint family, the latterfederally listed as endangered), <T3>Polygonella myriophylla</T3> (of the buckwheat family), and numeroussmall herbs including <T3>Bonamia grandiflora</T3> (of the morning glory family, threatened),<T3>Nolina brittoniana</T3> (agave family), and a few grasses such as <T3>Schizachyrium niveum</T3> (a bluestem grass endemic to central Florida).Christman (1988) lists 39 plant taxa that are virtually restricted to scrubvegetation. Of these taxa, 33 are present on the Lake Wales Ridge, whichappears to have the greatest number of endemic plant species in any singlehabitat in Florida. The State's two other major regions of plant endemismare the Apalachicola lowlands in northwest Florida and tropical Dade andMonroe Counties. Florida has the greatest degree of plant endemism in easternNorth America (Muller et al., in press). <T3>Ziziphus celata,</T3> Florida ziziphus, was first collected by RayGarrett in 1948 on sand dunes near Sebring; a second specimen was collectedby Leonard J. Brass in the company of Garrett, presumably from the samelocality. Garrett consulted with Erdman West and Lilian Arnold at the Universityof Florida, but neither could identify the plant. West had an illustrationprepared. Over the years, attempts were made to identify the shrub (which belongsto the family Rhamnaceae or buckthorns) and to relocate the shrub in thewild, with no success. Finally, Walter Judd noted the similarity of Garrett'sspecimen to several shrubs from the southwestern United States and Mexico.Judd and Hall (1984) proposed that Garrett's specimen represented a newspecies, which they named <T3>Ziziphus celate,</T3> most closely related to <T3>Ziziphus obtusifolia</T3> (lotebush, white crucillo, or gray thornof the deserts of southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, andMexico) and to <T3>Ziziphus parryi</T3> (California lotebush of southern California andBaja California) (Benson and Darrow 1981). Subsequently, Brass's specimenwas found at the herbarium of the Archbold Biological Station, and theillustration prepared under West's direction was also found (Wunderlinet al. 1985). In late July 1987, Kris R. DeLaney found a population of the Florida ziziphusin Polk County, Florida (Wunderlin et al. 1987). He found a second populationin Highlands County in the fall of 1988, after extended searches fundedby the Florida Nongame Wildlife Program (DeLaney et al., in press). <T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> is a shrub up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) high. Stemsoccur in groups and appear to be interconnected by extensive root systems(DeLaney personal communication 1989). Branches are zigzagged and bearshort, straight, spiny branchlets. Leaves are alternate, deciduous, withblades that are oblong-elliptic to obovate, dark glossy green above, lighterdull green beneath, 4.5 and 21 millimeters (0.18 to 0.83 inch) long, and3 to 13 millimeters (0.12 to 0.5 inches) wide. Leaves have rounded tips,cuneate bases, and entire margins (Wunderlin et al. 1987). Flowers areaxillary and solitary but appear fascicled. They have five sepals, whichare green in color, and have five white petals somewhat clasping an equalnumber of stamens. The floral disc is thickened and surrounds the ovary(Judd and Hall 1984). The fruit is a drupe (DeLaney et al., in press).<T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> may be recognized in the field by its small, dark,glossy green, entire leaves on conspicuously zigzag spiny branches. Largerspecimens tend to be covered with lichens (Wunderlin et al. 1987). Only two populations of <T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> are known, despite intensive floristic surveysof the Lake Wales Ridge in recent years. The first site consists of about30 stems in two groups on approximately two acres on the Lake Wales Ridgein Polk County. The site is on Avon Park Fine Sand, an excessively draineddeep sand soil. The site appears to represent a transition between sandpine scrub vegetation and longleaf pine (<T3>Pinus palustris</T3>) vegetation with turkey oak (<T3>Quercus laevis</T3>). The site has evergreen oaks, <T3>Carya floridana</T3> (scrub hickory), <T3>Bumelia tenax</T3> (a buckthorn), <T3>Prunus geniculata</T3> (scrub plum, endangered), and many herbs, including<T3>Berlandiera subacaulis</T3> (a yellow daisy), <T3>Bonamia grandiflora</T3> (Florida bonamia, threatened), <T3>Bulbostylis</T3> sp. (a small sedge), <T3>Liatris ohlingerae, Licania michauxii</T3> (gopher apple), <T3>Paronychia chartacea</T3> (papery whitlow wort, threatened), and <T3>Warea carteri</T3> (Carter's mustard, endangered) (Wunderlin et al.1987). The second population is larger. Section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 directed the Secretaryof the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants consideredto be endangered, threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as HouseDocument No. 94-51, was presented to the Congress on January 9, 1975. OnJuly 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the reportas a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3))of the Act, and of its intention thereby to review the status of the planttaxa it contained. On June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule(41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species recommendedby the Smithsonian Report to be endangered species pursuant to section4 of the Act. <T3>Campanula robinsiae, Justicia cooleyi,</T3> and <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> were included in the Smithsonian Report; theJuly 1, 1975, notice; and the June 16, 1976, proposal. On December 15, 1980, the Service published a notice of review for plants(45 FR 82480), which included <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> and <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> as category 1 candidates (taxa for which datain the Service's possession indicate listing is warranted). <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> was included as a category 2 candidate (a speciesfor which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is possiblyappropriate, but for which additional biological information is neededto support a proposed rule). A supplement to the 1980 notice of reviewpublished on November 28, 1983 (48 FR 53640), treated <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> as a category 2 candidate, based on uncertaintyabout the taxonomic status of the plant (Shetler 1963, Wunderlin et al.1980a). <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> was treated as a category 1 candidate, basedon a status report by Wunderlin et al. (1980b). An updated notice of reviewpublished on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526), maintained the three speciesas candidates in the same categories: <T3>Campanula robinsiae,</T3> category 2; <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> and <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3>, category 1. A letter from R. Wunderlin (<T3>in litt</T3>. 1985), received too late for the notice of review, suggestedthat recent field work on <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> had generated ``sufficient information toprepare a proposal for listing the species as endangered.'' The listingof <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> as an endangered species is based on the informationavailable in 1980, augmented by field work conducted by Gary Schultz forthe Florida Natural Areas Inventory and by Steven Christman (1988), plusrecent information on the rate of development of the two counties. In the September 27, 1985, notice of review, the newly-described <T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> was designated a category 2* candidate (the asteriskindicates that the taxon is possibly extinct). Subsequent discovery ofanother herbarium specimen and extant populations of the ziziphus haveconfirmed that this is a valid species that merits listing. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretaryto make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months of theirreceipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 Amendments further requires that allpetitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newlysubmitted on that date. This was the case for <T3>Campanula robinsiae, Justicia cooleyi,</T3> and <T3>Liatris ohlingerae,</T3> because the Service had accepted the 1975Smithsonian report as a petition. On October 13, 1983; October 12, 1984;October 11, 1985; October 10, 1986; and October 9, 1987, the Service foundthe petitioned listing of these species was warranted, and that, althoughpending proposals had precluded their proposal, expeditious progress wasbeing made to list these species. On September 12, 1988 (53 FR 35215), the Service published a proposal tolist <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> and <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> as endangered species. On September 28, 1988(53 FR 37818), the Service published a proposal to list <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> and <T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> as endangered species. The foregoing proposalsconstituted the final findings required for these species. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations </ITAG>In the September 1988 proposed rules, all interested parties were requestedto submit factual information that might contribute to the developmentof a final rule. Appropriate State of Florida agencies, county governments,Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and interested parties werecontacted and requested to comment. Notices inviting public comment werepublished in ``The Sun-Journal,'' Brooksville, for <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> and <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> (October 1, 1988), and in the ``Polk County Democrat''(October 13, 1988) and the ``Sebring News-Sun'' (October 16, 1988) for<T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> and <T3>Ziziphus celata.</T3> Comments were received from three State agencies, one Federal agency, twoplant nurseries, and one private conservation organization. The administrator of Withlacoochee State Forest (Division of Forestry,Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Service) requested furtherinformation on <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> and <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> and volunteered assistance in searching for populationsof these species in the Forest (where neither species is currently known).The research leader at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, SubtropicalAgricultural Research Station, provided additional information on the distributionof <T3>Justicia</T3> at the Station. He noted that current forage and livestockresearch at the Station appears compatible with protecting the habitatof <T3>Justicia,</T3> and possibly of <T3>Campanula</T3> (which they were not able to find this year). The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the FloridaGame and Fresh Water Fish Commission supported Federal listing of <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> and <T3>Ziziphus celata.</T3> Two horticulturists who operate native plant nurseries in Davenport, Florida,and in Aiken, South Carolina, commented on <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> and <T3>Ziziphus celata.</T3> One (from Florida) noted that Liatris ohlingeraehas been successfully grown from seed and established at a mine reclamationsite. This horticulturist also noted that there is no great commercialdemand for <T3>Liatris</T3> and that it is not a profitable crop. Both horticulturiststook exception to the wording of the proposal's treatment of critical habitat.Only two or three specialized nurseries deal with rare Florida scrub plants,and none would consider digging endangered species from the wild, nor takingseeds or cuttings if it would jeopardize the plant. Both requested thatthe critical habitat wording be altered to avoid before-the-fact criticismof the nurseries, and one suggested that propagation, and those able toeffect it, should be regarded in the final rule under ``Available ConservationMeasures'' as being beneficial, rather than as a negative factor under``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species.'' The Service concurs thatpropagation by nurseries does not threaten these four species, and acknowledgesthe useful data and other assistance that nurseries have provided. Theportions of the final rule dealing with critical habitat and the factorsaffecting the species have been altered to reflect these comments. However,the section dealing with available conservation measures only covers Federalmeasures specified in the Endangered Species Act, and does not includeother actions that can be taken by states or private parties. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that <T3>Campanula robinsiae, Justicia cooleyi, Liatris ohlingerae</T3> and<T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> should be classified as endangered species. Proceduresfound at section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors describedin section 4(a)(1). These factors and their applications to <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> Small (Brooksville bellflower), <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> Monachino andamp; E. Leonard (Cooley's water-willow),<T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>(S.F. Blake) B. Robinson (scrub blazing star),and <T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> Judd andamp; Hall (Florida ziziphus) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof their habitats or ranges. </T3>The known localities for <T3>Justicia cooleyi </T3>and <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>are in north central Hernando County, includingAnnutteliga Hammock near U.S. Highway 98. Some of the original hardwoodforest in this area has been converted to pastures, as shown on topographicmaps. Limestone quarries and associated holding ponds occupy at least 10square miles. A residential subdivision occupies 26 square miles, includingpart of Annutteliga Hammock. Smaller subdivisions and rural residencesare encroaching on other areas of forest. Hernando County was the secondfastest-growing county in the nation from 1980 to 1986, growing by 74.8percent during this period, according to a Census Bureau report (``TheNew York Times,'' September 1, 1987). The University of Florida, Bureauof Economic and Business Research confirms that this rapid growth is continuing,with the 1987 population estimated to have increased 79.3 percent over1980, for a total of 79,718 (``Jacksonville Times-Union,'' August 26, 1987).The proposed Suncoast Corridor tollroad, part of a Tampa-Jacksonville corridor,which would pass west of Brooksville, would encourage population growthin Hernando County. <T3>Justicia cooley </T3>is native to hardwood forests in Hernando County,although two of the seven known sites are in modified forest, one on awide highway right-of-way among a group of trees and the other in an unusualseepage area in a cattle pasture on Chinsegut Hill. The small number ofknown sites, despite searches by capable field botanists, indicates thatany further loss of suitable habitat would seriously threaten the continuedexistence of the species. <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>is known to occur only at three sites. Onesite, with few plants, is in a seepage area with <T3>Justicia cooleyi </T3>on Chinsegut Hill. The site has been used asa pasture for many years and no changes in land management are anticipated.The two principal populations are at the margins of two ``prairies'' orponds with seasonally fluctuating water levels. Changes in land use inthe watersheds surrounding the prairies have the potential to affect waterlevels in the ponds by increasing the quantity of runoff; runoff waterfrom developed areas may also be contaminated by petroleum products, fertilizers,and herbicides. Therefore, while there appears to be little danger of destructionof this plant's habitat, adverse modification of the habitat constitutesa serious threat to <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3>. <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is restricted to sand pine scrub vegetationon the Lake Wales Ridge and the nearby Auburndale area in Highlands andPolk Counties, Florida. Sand pine scrub vegetation occurs elsewhere inthese counties and the rest of the State, but lacks <T3>Liatris ohlingerae. </T3>The Lake Wales Ridge is a major citrus producingarea, and the towns along the Ridge are growing rapidly. In Highlands County,64 percent of the xeric vegetation (scrub, scrubby flatwoods, and longleafpine-turkey oak vegetation) present before settlement had been destroyedby 1981. An additional 10 percent of the xeric vegetation was moderatelydisturbed, primarily by building roads to create housing subdivisions (Peroniand Abrahamson 1985). Christman (1988), using different methodology, estimatedthat ``ancient'' scrub originally occupied about 80,000 acres on the LakeWales, Lake Henry, and Winter Haven ridges; about two-thirds of the ancientscrub has been lost. Remaining tracts of scrub on the Lake Wales Ridgein Polk and Highlands counties are rapidly being developed for citrus groves,housing developments, and businesses (Christman 1988; Fred Lohrer, ArchboldBiological Station, personal communication 1985; James Duane, ExecutiveDirector, Central Florida Regional Planning Council, personal communication1988). Many of the remaining stands of scrub are on vacant lots, patches of landisolated by railroad tracks, or other fragments of the original vegetation.Some of the few remaining large areas of scrub are found in subdivisionswhere lots were sold to absentee owners, but houses were not built. Thefragmented land ownership, the difficulty of contacting landowners, andinformal use of such subdivisions as trash dumps and recreation areas makeconservation of the vegetation difficult. <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>does not occur in federally owned sand pinescrub vegetation on the Avon Park Air Force Range. The plant does occurat these tracts owned by or being purchased by the State of Florida: ArbuckleState Park and Arbuckle State Forest in Polk County, Highlands HammockState Park and the Saddle Blanket Lakes tract in Highlands County. It alsooccurs on the private Archbold Biological Station. The relatively large number of known localities for <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is misleading. Because it has conspicuous flowersand is easily identified, it has been collected very frequently, much like<T3>Polygonella myriophylla, </T3>a distinctive species of the same habitat.Many of the known sites for the blazing star have already been destroyed,but no exact count is available. Although the blazing star is still locallyabundant, most of the extant sites are small, and sites are disappearingvery rapidly. For example, in January of 1988, Christman (personal communication1988) prepared for The Nature Conservancy a list of ten sites that collectivelycould constitute a network of preserves for the central Florida scrub flora;by late March, three of the sites had changed hands, including one thathad been considered relatively secure. <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>was first collected near Sebring at a site thathas not been relocated, unless it is the site found in 1988 by DeLaney.One of the two known existing populations consists of about 30 stems. Mostor all of the stems may be from a single rootstock. The site is privatelyowned. It was nearly destroyed in 1988 because the owner was required toclear the native vegetation in order to continue to qualify for an agriculturalexemption from the usual property tax rate. The site is now temporarilyprotected (Wunderlin et al. 1987; R. Wunderlin, personal communication1988). Property tax policies thus threaten this and other native plantspecies. DeLaney and Wunderlin, funded by the Florida Nongame WildlifeProgram, searched for more populations in 1988 but found only one. B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. Justicia cooleyi </T3>is not of interest as an ornamental (RobertMcCartney, personal communication 1986), but it occurs at the same siteas a rare fern that is vulnerable to collection by fern enthusiasts, soit is inadvisable to publicize the exact localities of <T3>Justicia cooleyi.</T3>The Florida National Areas Inventory treats data on <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>as sensitive because the plant is restrictedto only 3 sites and is therefore vulnerable to overcollecting and vandalism.<T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>has been tested by a Dutch firm for cultivationas a cut flower because of its exceptionally large flower heads that aremore pinkish than those of other members of the genus (S. Wallace, BokTower Gardens, personal communication 1988). This activity does not threatenthe species, which is easily grown from seed. Although other members ofthe genus <T3>Liatris </T3>are popular in North America as garden perennials, thisspecies does not appear to be threatened by present or foreseeable tradein native plants.<T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>is one of the rarest shrubs in North America.Unrestricted scientific collecting or excessive visits could seriouslyaffect the two populations.C. <T3>Disease or predation</T3>. Not applicable.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. Campanula robinsiae,Justicia cooleyi, </T3>and <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>are listed as endangered by the Preservationof Native Flora of Florida Act (andSection; 581.185-187, Florida Statutes),which regulates taking, transport, and sale of plants but does not providehabitat protection. <T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> is proposed for addition to the State list bythe Florida Legislature in 1989. Listing under the Act augments State andprivate conservation measures for these plants by providing for habitatprotection through section 7 and recovery planning.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting their continued existence.</T3>Restriction to specialized habitats and to small geographic rangestends to intensify any adverse effects on any rare plant. This is the casefor <T3>Campanula robinsiae, Justicia cooleyi, </T3>and <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3>, and is exacerbated by the loss of habitatwhich has already taken place. <T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> may be threatened by loss of genetic diversitybecause the existing populations may consist of only a few clones (genets).The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thesespecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list these four plant species as endangered.Their limited remaining habitats and vulnerability to human activitiesindicate that all four species are in danger of extinction throughout allor significant portions of their ranges, and therefore fit the Act's definitionof endangered.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires, to the maximum extent prudent anddeterminable, that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the timea species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service findsthat designation of critical habitat is not prudent for these four plantspecies at this time. Federal, State and local agencies can be alertedto the presence of these species through the resources of the Florida NaturalAreas Inventory and Regional Planning Councils, including geographic informationsystems that provide much more detailed information than critical habitatdescriptions and maps. Publication of critical habitat descriptions andmaps would increase the degree of threat from taking or vandalism. <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> is restricted to three sites that could easilybe damaged by trampling or collecting. <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is an attractive plant that could be vulnerableto transplanting from the wild to home gardens. Live specimens of <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>might be of interest to a limited number of hobbyists.Removal of attractive plants, or plant curiosities, from the wild by collectorsand hobbyists has been a serious problem for many years in south Florida.In addition, efforts to conserve the scrub habitat of <T3>Liatris ohlingerae, Ziziphus celata</T3>, and other plant species havealready provoked some landowners to preemptively destroy the vegetation.The Central Florida Regional Planning Council and other agencies are seekingto provide incentives for landowners to maintain scrub. Designating criticalhabitat could unduly alarm landowners, undermining these conservation efforts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part,below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to any critical habitat. Regulationsimplementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codifiedat 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) require Federal agencies to ensurethat activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardizethe continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adverselymodify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed speciesor its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter intoformal consultation with the Service.Most of the currently known sites for the four plant species are on privatelyowned land. The only known Federal ownership is for some populations of<T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> and <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> on a U.S. Department of Agriculture researchstation, whose past management practices have been consistent with theneeds of both species. The Station's staff knows of their presence. Bothspecies also occur on protected State land. The currently known sites for<T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> are on private land, except for two owned by,or being purchased by the State. The two currently known sites for <T3>Ziziphus celata</T3> are on private land. The State of Florida is awareof the need to conserve both species. There is no Federal involvement currentlyon State or private lands in the area. Populations of <T3>Liatris ohlingerae</T3> that extend onto State-owned highway rights-of-waymay be subject to Federal involvement if the U.S. Department of Transportation(Federal Highway Administration) should provide funds for maintenance orconstruction. Federal mortgage programs may be subject to section 7 review,including those of U.S. Department of Agriculture (Farmers Home Administration),Veterans Administration, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development(Federal Housing Administration loans). The supply of electricity to newhousing developments may be subject to Federal involvement through theRural Electrification Administration.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions,in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States to import or export any endangered plant, transport itin interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity,sell or offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or removeit and reduce it to possession from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Inaddition, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibit themalicious damage or destruction of listed plants on Federal lands and alsoprohibit removing, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying themin knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including State criminaltrespass laws. Certain exceptions can apply to agents of the Service andState conservation agencies.The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permitsto carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered speciesunder certain circumstances. There is no commercial trade in <T3>Campanula robinsiae, Justicia cooleyi,</T3> or <T3>Ziziphus celata</T3>, and no known interstate commercial trade withinthe United States in <T3>Liatris ohlingerae.</T3> The Service anticipates few, if any, requestsfor permits.
