Each time rivals R.H. Macy andamp; Co. and Campeau Corp. upped theante for the giant retailer, which owns popular department storeslike Bloomingdale's and Filene's, Federated's stock soared.   But while stockholders were singing ``we're in the money'' asthey watched share prices jump by 50 percent since bidding beganlate January, owners of Federated's bonds were just plain singingthe blues. The prospect of saddling Federated with new debt once adeal was forged has depressed bond prices by about 20 percent andbrought trading to a virtual standstill.   Interest also has waned in debt issued by companies likeAmerican Standard Inc., another takeover target, and Stop andamp; ShopCos., which recently agreed to a friendly leveraged buyout to avoida hostile acquistion, although their stock doubled in price.   In fact, the recent resurgence in takeovers has hurt the entireindustrial bond market, regardless of whether the securities arevulnerable to what Wall Street dubbs ``event-risks,'' such asrecapitalizations and leveraged buyouts. In an LBO, a company isacquired largely through borrowed money repaid through the targetcompany's profits or asset sales.   ``It's been a disaster for bondholders,'' said James L. Kochan,chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.``There is a considerable number of investors who have chosen toavoid the entire (industrial) industry.   ``We feel much more comfortable in recommending utility bondissues and bonds of telephones or banks.''   Investment advisors suggest that industrial bondholders sellsecurities considered vulnerable and retain the rest. Bonds thatalready have been depressed, such as those issued by Federated,eventually could bounce back and shouldn't be sold for now, theysay.   ``If they (the winning bidder) run it like a first-classoperation, then there's no reason why these things can't pop backto where they were,'' said Anthony Naylor, senior vice president offixed-income securities for Rodman andamp; Renshaw Inc.   Analysts attribute the increased takeover activity partly to thefact that October's stock market crash made share prices attractiveand to an improving economy.   Naylor said his firm recently has been paying more attention totrying to predict which companies could become takeover targets.One possible giveaway is a high cash flow, which ironically is whatattracts bondholders to a company to begin with, he said.   Having lots of cash on hand means companies will be able to payoff the interest and principal on their outstanding debt, but theircreditworthiness diminishes when that's diluted.   ``As you leverage out the balance sheet and have more debtburden ... cash flow is diverted to servicing that debt, and itmakes a very tight situation in some cases,'' said Kenneth Pfeil, asenior vice president at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., a majordebt-rating service. ``Sometimes cash flow is not enough, and thecompany has to sell off assets.''   Consequently, takeover targets and suitors often are placed oncredit watch for possible downgrading as soon as bidding begins.The lower the debt rating, the more expensive it is for a companyto borrow money.   Among those currently on Sandamp;P's credit watch are AmericanStandard and its former hostile bidder, Black andamp; Decker Corp.; andStop andamp; Shop and its former unwanted suitor, Dart Group Corp.   Moody's Investors Service, another debt rater, said that 32percent of its downgradings in the industrial bond sector duringthe first quarter were due to so-called event risks. It suggestsmore might be forthcoming.   Part of a bondholder's risk lies in being a passive investor.While suitors have to win stockholder approval before acquiring acompany, bondholders have little say in the matter.   Analysts say new protections should be adopted to givebondholders more security. Kerr-McGee Corp. and a handful of otherissuers already have introduced ``poison puts,'' which forcecompanies to buy back their debt securities at par in case of ahostile takeover.   ``It's an attractive thing for the bondholder. I think it couldbe a new enticement to minimize the risk,'' said Eric Friedlander,a corporate bond trader for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions April 2-3</NOTE></DOC>
