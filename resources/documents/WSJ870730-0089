The accord is the latest in a series of ventures and independent efforts to find a vaccine for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The venture links two countries that formerly were embroiled in a dispute over credit for discovering the AIDS virus.    Under the terms of the pact, Institut Merieux will pay Cambridge Bioscience an undisclosed sum to broaden the Worcester, Mass.-based concern's AIDS-vaccine research program. Lyon-based Merieux would receive an exclusive world-wide license to market any resulting vaccine products.    The collaboration combines the research capability of Cambridge Bioscience, which draws upon a number of prominent Harvard University scientists as consultants, and the world-wide vaccine manufacturing and distribution track record of Merieux. A third company, Connaught Laboratories Inc. of Canada, is expected to help with clinical trials, Cambridge Bioscience said.    The companies said they won't limit their research to any one particular vaccine technology, but will broadly investigate a number of approaches, including recombinant DNA (or gene-spliced) vaccines; sub-unit vaccines using a harmless viral protein; vaccines based on vaccinia (or cow-pox); and so-called anti-idiotypes, which use antibodies that look like the virus itself as synthetic vaccines. All vaccines work on the principle of using natural or synthetic viral material to trick the body into creating antibodies and other cells that later will attack and kill a real viral invader.    Gerald F. Buck, chairman and chief executive officer of Cambridge Bioscience, said that &quot;it's important not to see AIDS vaccine work in terms of winners and losers, but in terms of collaborators.&quot;    The Franco-U.S. collaboration follows announcements of earlier AIDS vaccine pacts between Merck andamp; Co. and Repligen Corp., and between Chiron Inc. and Ciba-Geigy Corp. A number of other companies are working on an AIDS vaccine, including Genentech Inc., Genetic Systems Inc. and Viral Technologies.    Merieux sells vaccines in 150 countries and has a major market presence in Africa, which suffers uncounted numbers of AIDS cases and is believed by many to be the cradle of the AIDS virus.    Jacques Armand, Merieux's director of research, said: &quot;Progress in vaccines is very slow. But the dimensions of AIDS, and the fact that we're dealing with blood, sex and a dread disease (places) people under pressure. The pressure will be high to test the product in animals and in man. But it's impossible to tell you dates. We don't have a crystal ball.&quot;    William Haseltine, a scientist at Harvard and Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, as well as a consultant for Cambridge Bioscience, said the recent disappointing results obtained by several groups in chimpanzee studies means building a usable AIDS vaccine &quot;isn't going to be as simple as putting&quot; pieces of the virus's outer coat in man.    &quot;Now, I'm saying, let's probe in great detail the nature of the viral protein, to find out why there isn't protective immunity,&quot; he added. &quot;It's going to be a real challenge, and it will take multiple large-scale collaborations,&quot; to solve the problem. </TEXT></DOC>
