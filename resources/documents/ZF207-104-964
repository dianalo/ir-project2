Department of DefenseDefense ContractsProposalAcquisition.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DOD Reviews Rules on Release of DataandM;Several federal acquisition issues already have jumped to the forefront ofthe agenda for the 101st Congress and the Bush administration.andM;One topic receiving considerable attention is the release of governmentacquisition information.andP;  Some agencies, especially the Defense Department,are conducting voluntary reviews of their acquisition rules.andP;  Implementingsome of the changes indicated by the review may head off possible reformlegislation.andM;Last summer's defense procurement investigation uncovered several cases ofillegal inside-information trading and prompted DOD officials to examine moreclosely the type of information that should be released to contractors.andP;  Theyalso considered releasing data that normally is not available but that mightbenefit all competitors.andM;A request for information recently was issued to several industryassociations asking about ways to improve DOD's data release system.andP;  Inresponse to the RFI, the trade groups supported the release of early versionsof requirements documents as well as changes as they occur.andP;  For specificprocurements, they recommended the release of all non-proprietary governmentcontrolled technical data.andP;  According to the industry groups, suchinformation will better enable contractors to understand requirements andpotentially lead to more responsive proposals.andM;Releasing funding profiles such as program objective memorandums andfive-year plans, including budget estimates, would help contractors determinewhich programs are most likely to survive the budget process and would allowfor more efficient allocation of limited bid and proposal resources, theysaid.andM;The industry groups also requested that information on individual weaponsystems program funding thresholds be provided at the time the programs aresynopsized in the Commerce Business Daily.andP;  They also suggested that DODrelease current funding profiles.andM;The government could increase competition and pay better prices for equipmentif it set low price as the main criterion for awards only for purchases withclearly defined specifications, the groups said.andP;  Other factors they saidmust be considered in awarding contracts were quality and real cost.andM;Making government cost study and cost model information available to biddersmay reduce contractors' motivation to acquire inside pricing information orset unrealistically low offers.andP;  In the case of follow-on competitions, italso would reduce the advantage now afforded incumbent contractors, theysaid.andM;The respondents said DOD should release lists of prospective bidders alongwith the draft RFP and the names of bidders after the offers have beenreceived.andP;  These changes would reduce the likelihood of sensitive informationbeing acquired illegally and eliminate secret agreements between companies,the associations said.andM;Clarification and consistent direction on marketing activities such as therules on the number and duration of permissible visits to governmentactivities would help place all prospective bidders on more equal footing andprovide for a less subjective source selection process, the groups said.andM;On other matters, the General Accounting Office and a 41-member panel ofcongressional, industry and government officials have recommended changes inthe procurement system.andM;The GAO reported that cost growth, lengthy acquisition periods and programdelays remain common problems in defense procurement.andP;  Officials suggestedDOD stabilize the acquisition process and establish proactive rather thanreactive management and internal control systems.andP;  The report also said DODshould examine defense contractors' internal control systems and increase theprofessionalism of the DOD procurement workforce.andM;The report said legislation should be enacted requiring defense contractorsto submit annual management reports on their internal controls.andM;Another report just issued by the Project on Monitoring DefenseReorganization recommends that a specialized acquisition corps be establishedwithin each military service.andP;  It also suggests that corps members be paidsalaries comparable to those received by counterparts in the private sector.andM;What is promising about these results is that members of the project includesenators, congressmen, defense industry executives, and retired militaryofficials.andP;  Their support may produce the needed changes to the acquisitionworkforce structure.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
