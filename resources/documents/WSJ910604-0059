In two deeply critical reports released on the anniversaryof the 1989 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, AmnestyInternational said religious and political repression hasworsened and thousands of Chinese are in jail for theirbeliefs.</LP><TEXT>   With world attention distracted by the Persian Gulf Warand its aftermath, China's leaders have continued &quot;to stampout any form of dissent,&quot; the human-rights organization said.It said some well-publicized sentences handed down againstprotest leaders this year were relatively light and masked&quot;the true severity of this latest stage in the repression.&quot;   &quot;It's not uncommon for people out of the spotlight --ordinary activists or those tried outside Beijing -- to bejailed for 10 to 20 years, sometimes simply for makingdissident speeches,&quot; said a 55-page report on trials andpunishments since 1989.   The report listed 310 political trials that researchershave documented since the June 4, 1989, crackdown inTiananmen Square.   In cataloging the deprivations, Amnesty International saidthose tried were unable to appeal.   It said the trials were unfair, sentences and verdictsusually decided by the authorities in advance, and foreignreporters, diplomats and some relatives barred from thecourts. The report also said hundreds more people wereserving long sentences imposed at secret trials &quot;withoutanyone knowing where they are&quot; or were secretly executed inthe aftermath of the protests.   The documented cases included major Beijing trials inFebruary of two alleged masterminds of the 1989 movement whogot 13 years each and a marine biologist who got 18 years inthe eastern province of Shangdong for supporting the protest.   Amnesty International, which opposes capital punishment,said there has also been a marked increase in executions byfiring squad for criminal offenses. It recorded more than 750executions in 1990, but believed the &quot;real number is in thethousands.&quot;   The organization also said torture in jails has increased.</TEXT></DOC>
