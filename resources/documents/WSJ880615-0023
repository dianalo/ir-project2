The inquiry was disclosed yesterday, when the FBI searched 31 locations under federal search warrants. Federal investigators searched three Connecticut offices of Norden Systems Inc. and the the Washington office of Pratt andamp; Whitney Aircraft. Both companies are units of Hartford-based United Technologies Corp.    Other companies searched in the federal investigation include St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.; Northrop Corp. of Los Angeles; Hazeltine Corp. of Greenlawn, N.Y.; and the Great Neck, N.Y., offices of Unisys Corp.    The FBI and Naval Investigative Service also searched offices of Melvin Paisley, formerly the Navy's chief of research, who since 1986 has been a private consultant specializing in defense contracting. In addition, investigators searched the offices of a Navy weapons manager and an Air Force tactical air expert. The government said the searches didn't lead to any arrests. Mr. Paisley couldn't be reached for comment.    The far-flung investigation began two years ago after a former Navy official tipped off the Naval Investigative Service. The FBI got involved some months later, and the inquiry mushroomed. Currently, according to the FBI, it &quot;focuses on allegations of fraud and bribery on the part of defense contractors, consultants, and U.S. government employees.&quot;    Among other things, the investigators are trying to find out how sensitive contract information travels within the defense community, and whether information has been shared in an effort to fix prices on contracts that the services have opened up to competition.    &quot;This is big,&quot; said a defense contractor attorney in Washington. &quot;But we still don't know what it's all about.&quot; Senior Pentagon officials were also surprised by the searches. &quot;The first I knew of it was when they came in the building and sealed off an office,&quot; said an Air Force officer.    The government's inquiry differs from most other criminal investigationsof the defense industry. Since the Justice Department and internal Pentagon investigators have focused on contractor fraud in the last three years, they have launched dozens of investigations into possible wrongdoing by individual companies. Typically, investigations have centered on such abuses as charging the government for inappropriate expenses, shifting costs from one contract to another, or negotiating contracts under false pretexts.    The current investigation is far wider. Although it began with the Navy, it may involves all the branches of the military. No one could explain how so many contractors and other officials could be involved in a singhe scheme or pattern of abuse.    The companies linked so far to the inquiry confirmed that the searches occurred yesterday, but provided no information on what the investigation may uncover. A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said that the search there involved &quot;work of a consultant&quot; hired by the company. The spokesman added that the company believed the work to be &quot;entirely proper.&quot;    Altogether, the searches covered twelve states and the District of Columbia. Investigators didn't disclose all of the locations searched yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
