The charge was made on the eve of a worldconference here on ozone problems.   The environmental group said it obtained figures distributed onlyto governments and industries indicating that Britain last yearproduced 105,000 tons of chlorofluorocarbon gases and exported48,146 tons.   The compounds, widely used in refrigerator coolants, foaminsulation, fast-food packaging and propellants for aerosol spraycans, are destroying the ozone layer _ the fragile atmosphericshield that protects the Earth's surface from the sun'scancer-causing ultraviolet rays.   The compounds also contribute to the greenhouse effect, trappingheat, gradually warming the Earth's surface and contributing topotentially dangerous shifts in global weather patterns.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Wednesday her governmentplans to require all new refrigerators to use safer solvents and allnew cars to take unleaded gasoline by 1990.   She spoke in an interview for the British Broadcasting Corp.television program ``Nature,'' to be broadcast Thursday.   Britain has invited government ministers, industry leaders andscientists to a three-day conference beginning Sunday to discusspractical steps to reduce the problems. More than 110 countries haveaccepted.   Britain has vowed to reduce chloroflurocarbon emissions by 85percent by 1999. An additional 30 countries have ratified the 1987Montreal Protocol that calls for a 50 percent reduction by then.   Greenpeace wants the compounds banned immediately.   ``Some (chloroflurocarbons) have a life of at least 380 years, soeach one we produce adds to the potentially lethal legacy we areleaving for 10 generations,'' said Greenpeace spokesman SteveElsworth.   Greenpeace said annual world consumption of chloroflurocarbons isestimated to be 1 million to 1.2 million tons. It said West Europeand the United States accounted for 73.6 percent of production in1984, and 70 percent of consumption in 1985.   Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley told reporters Wednesday abig demand remains worldwide for chloroflurocarbons and jointinternational efforts are needed to reduce it.   Greenpeace said no one has ever published a country-by-countrylist of chloroflurocarbon producers containing precise productionfigures.   Lord Caithness, a junior environment minister, confirmed at abriefing on the weekend conference that Britain is ``one of thelargest'' chloroflurocarbon producers, but added, ``America is moreof a bigger producer than us.''   Greenpeace said a 1988 report written for the French Ministry ofthe Environment lists the capacity of chloroflurocarbon plantsworldwide and estimated that European Economic Community plantsoperated at 70 percent capacity on average. Britain is one of the 12EEC members.   By matching capacity with performance, Greenpeace said it arrivedat its production figures, showing that in 1984, the main producerof chloroflurocarbons was the United States, with 455,000 tons or37.4 percent of world production.   It was followed by West Europe with 440,000 tons or 36.2 percentof production; Japan with 150,000 tons or 12.4 percent; andcommunist countries with 120,000 tons or 4.1 percent.   Greenpeace said Britain has a production capacity of 150,000tons, so if it operated last year at the 70 percent average, itwould have produced 105,000 tons.</TEXT></DOC>
