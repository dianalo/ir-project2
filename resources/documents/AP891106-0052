Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, onSunday appealed to East Germans to stay home and push for change intheir own country.   In an article for the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Vogel said herespected the decision of East Germans to emigrate to West Germany.   ``But we are appealing to all those who are thinking ofemigrating to carefully examine whether they should not stay inEast Germany to support the process of democratization and toengage themselves in that process,'' he wrote.   Ernst Breit, head of the national Trade Union Federation,cautioned the refugees not to entertain mistaken notions about lifein West Germany: ``We have to make it clear to them that WestGermany is not paradise.''   Karl Heinz Horndasch, a spokesman for the federal border policein Munich, said late Sunday that the number of temporary sheltersfor the refugees had jumped from four on Friday to 25 nationwide.   ``We are considering now whether we will have to open more,''Horndasch said by telephone.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leading politicians called onEast Germany's new leader, Egon Krenz, to adopt reforms quickly tostop the exodus.   ``We hope that things will change so that people will not haveto leave their homeland to find happiness,'' Kohl said.   East Germany today published the draft of a new law allowingcitizens 30 days a year of free travel in the West and speeding theprocessing of passport applications. The law also woulddecriminalize illegal stays in the West, although direct violationsof the border _ such as escaping over the Berlin Wall _ would bepunished, Interior Minister Friedrich Dickel said.   Alfred Dregger, a parliamentary leader in Kohl's coalitiongovernment, urged the East German leadership to allow freeelections.   ``The Communist Party's monopoly on power is eroding,'' Dreggersaid. ``The protest movement is a wild fire that Egon Krenz and theCommunist Party can only put out by free elections.''   Thousands more East Germans flooded into West Germany throughCzechoslovakia after their government permitted its citizens, forthe first time, to cross to the West through that country withnothing more than East German identification papers.   The pace of the weekend exodus slowed today, but the tally ofEast German arrivals since Saturday was 19,000 and still rising.   Some Germans said East Germany's leaders had, figuratively,opened a hole in the Berlin Wall with the new Czechoslovak escaperoute.   Driving their sputtering Trabants and Wartburgs filled withstereos, luggage and children, the refugees needed to travel only15 miles from the East German border to reach Bavaria in WestGermany.   Many of the latest refugees went to temporary shelters.   Horndasch, the police spokesman, said 12,500 refugees were inmilitary barracks, police training centers, a gymnasium, and othertemporary shelters. He said many were staying three to four daysbefore heading off to find housing and jobs.   Some local police and relief workers wondered when the crushwould end.   ``How long will they keep coming? That you have to ask Mr.Krenz,'' said Uwe Luethje, a border police officer at theSchirnding border crossing in northeastern Bavaria.   At times Sunday, the refugees coming over the border atSchirnding caused traffic jams backed up several several miles intoCzechoslovakia.   Horndasch, the border policeman in Munich, said about 1,400 morerefugees were expected later in the day on trains from Prague, theCzechoslovak capital.   ``The people will keep fleeing as long as they can,'' saidChristian Schreiber, a 23-year dental technician from Staakenoutside East Berlin.   In addition to the East Germans arriving at Schirnding andWaidhaus, 10 trains carrying refugees from Prague also crossed intoMarktredwitz.</TEXT></DOC>
