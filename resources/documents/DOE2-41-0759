Four thick coal seams (11.25 m, 13.2 m, 10 m and 40 m) inclinedfrom 8-12 degrees have to be excavated to a depth of 240 m. Overburdenand coal will be excavated using 30 m high working benches at two 15m levels using eight bucket wheel excavators, one bucket chain excavatorand 11 belt conveyors (8 of 1400 m belt width, 2 of 2200 mm width and1 of 1800 mm width), one separating station and one A2RsB-8500.60 stacker,Estimated total investment is 46x10{sup 9} Yu Din, estimated operatingcost is 12,840 Din/t. Eight submerged pumps attached to floating raftswill drain water. Total length of belt conveyors will exceed 44 km. 4refs.</TEXT></DOC>
