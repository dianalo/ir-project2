But, some analysts cautioned, the gains may be more modestthan they were predicting several weeks ago.</LP><TEXT>   Burton Strauss Jr., an analyst at Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., said he expects operating earnings for the rail group,excluding big write-offs at two railroads, to rise 5% to 10%over last year's final period, reflecting the industry'sefforts to cut costs and boost productivity.   &quot;Railroads will have a good performance in a recessionaryperiod,&quot; said Andras Petery, an analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp;Co. &quot;They controlled operating costs as traffic volumedeclined, maintained firm pricing, improved fuel efficiencyand asset utilization and reaped the benefits of changes intechnology and management procedures.&quot;   Mr. Petery added that some railroads have begun to benefitfrom federally mandated changes in rail work practices andconditions, including reductions in the size of freight traincrews. But the largest potential savings from reduced manninglevels on freight trains won't be realized until 1992 and1993, he said.   Although operating earnings for most of the nation's majorrailroads will rise, analysts said large after-tax specialcharges at Norfolk Southern Corp. and Consolidated Rail Corp.will drag down the group's net income in the quarter. Thecharges partly reflect the costs of implementing thereductions in train-crew sizes.   Some analysts said they are disappointed by rail trafficlevels, which, they thought, would have begun to rise by yearend, compared with depressed carloadings in most commoditiesa year earlier.   &quot;Rail traffic is making us worry more and more aboutearnings gains,&quot; said Michael Lloyd, an analyst at SalomonBrothers Inc. &quot;Railroads will still have earnings gains,because they had a lousy quarter a year ago, particularly atBurlington Northern and Santa Fe. But the gains in generalare likely to be less than we would have thought a monthago,&quot; Mr. Lloyd said.   Carloadings at the major railroads dropped 1.6% during the12-week period ending Dec. 14, according to the Associationof American Railroads. Shipments of lumber fell 4.2%, paperdeclined 3.3%, metals dropped 4.7% and chemicals were offless than 1%. But the biggest disappointment was coal. Coalloadings fell 3.2%, compared with strong coal shipments inthe year-earlier period. The decline in coal shipments partlyreflected the effects of a severe November snowstorm thatdisrupted operations in the low-sulfur coal fields ofWyoming's Powder River Basin.   But some traffic groups showed gains in the quarter. Grainshipments rose 3.5%. Shipments of motor vehicles increased4.9%, compared with severely depressed levels a year earlier,while intermodal traffic (highway trailers or containerscarried on rail flatcars) rose 4.8% in the 12week period.   Among the major railroads, Santa Fe Pacific Corp. andBurlington Northern Inc. are expected to show the biggestearnings gains.   Dennis Springer, vice president-treasurer of Santa FePacific, noted a &quot;significant improvement,&quot; compared with aloss from continuing operations of 18 cents a share in lastyear's quarter. He cited improved operating performance atthe company's rail unit, continued growth of its preciousmetals segment and an absence of special charges in thecurrent quarter. But Mr. Springer didn't comment on analysts'estimates that Santa Fe Pacific will earn about 18 cents ashare in the current quarter.   A spokesman for Burlington Northern said that analysts'estimates that the company will post earnings of about 85cents a share are &quot;reasonable.&quot; But he added that &quot;it is verydifficult in this economy to know how well carloadings aregoing to continue, and there is some downside risk with thoseestimates.&quot;   For the year-earlier quarter, Burlington Northern postednet income of 58 cents a share and said its performance washurt by higher fuel costs, a significant traffic decline andunusually severe operating conditions caused by floods. Butthe Burlington Northern spokesman said that the currentquarter is benefiting from manpower reductions and lower fuelcosts, strong export grain shipments and recovery of its coalbusiness after the weatherrelated disruptions in November.   Analysts said they also expect modest gains in operatingearnings at Union Pacific Corp., Norfolk Southern and CSXCorp.   A spokesman for Union Pacific said carloadings at the railunit are expected to rise 2.4% in the quarter, its lowesttraffic gains for any quarter this year, while energy pricesat the resources unit have been declining. He declined tocomment on analysts' estimates that earnings will be flat to5% ahead of year-earlier net of 88 cents a share, adjustedfor a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective Oct. 1.   A Norfolk Southern spokesman also declined to comment onanalysts' estimates that the company would post higheroperating earnings, excluding a special charge for proposedcrew-member reductions. In the year-earlier quarter, NorfolkSouthern had net income of $117.1 million, or 75 cents ashare. The spokesman said the railroad's carloads havedeclined 3.3% so far this quarter. While coal shipments arerunning 9% behind, shipments of intermodal are up 7.7%, hesaid.   A spokesman for CSX said the company expects operatingearnings, excluding extraordinary items, to be &quot;flat to upslightly.&quot; He said operating profit at its ocean-containerunit will benefit from cost controls and stronger revenue.Operating profit at the railroad will be &quot;flat to modestlyhigher,&quot; he said, reflecting improved rate levels and aneffort to improve the quality and efficiency of rail service.   CSX's barge unit is likely to have slightly loweroperating profit because of a decline in grain traffic, whichis partly the result of an early freeze that closed the upperMississippi River. The spokesman said CSX's operating profitalso will be influenced by whether or not some property salesclose before the end of the year.   Analysts are predicting a decline in Conrail's earnings,excluding the effects of an after-tax special chargeestimated at $420 million to $450 million. In the yearearlierquarter, Conrail posted net income of $76 million, or $1.61 afully diluted share. Conrail officials declined to comment onanalysts' estimates.   Conrail has impressed Wall Street this year by postingearnings gains amid traffic declines. &quot;We began 1991 planningfor the worst, and it turned out to be a wise strategy,&quot; saida Conrail spokesman, adding that the company has &quot;afundamentally improved cost structure as economic conditionsslowly improve in 1992.&quot;   But the rebound in rail traffic that some analysts andinvestors expected appears to be stalled. &quot;There is nothinggoing on out there that makes me optimistic,&quot; said H. WilliamBrown, Conrail's chief financial officer, during a conferencecall with analysts earlier this month. Mr. Brown noted atthat time that General Motors Corp., which has subsequentlyannounced plans to shutter 21 plants and shed 74,000 workersin the next three years, is one of Conrail's biggestcustomers. &quot;If there are changes to our traffic-volumeexpectations next year, they will be down, not up,&quot; Mr. Brownsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
