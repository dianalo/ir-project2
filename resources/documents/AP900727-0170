He was 38.   It was unclear when and how he died, said Sgt. Richard Terry ofthe Contra Costa County Coroner's office.   ``We lost a brother and we are very devastated,'' said GratefulDead spokesman Dennis McNally.   The 1960s counterculture band, known for such hits as ``CaseyJones,'' and ``Truckin','' retains a loyal cult following today.Fans _ known as ``Deadheads'' and including people who weren't bornwhen the band first came to prominence _ follow the group fromperformance to performace.   An autopsy on Mydland was scheduled for Friday morning.   Friends apparently went to his home in Lafayette, a suburb 25miles east of San Francisco, after being unable to contact Mydland,Terry said. He had returned Tuesday from New York City, where theband completed a three-week national tour, Terry said.   Mydland wrote the well-known Grateful Dead tune ``Far From Me,''and more recently co-wrote the environmental ballad ``We Can Run(But We Can't Hide),'' which was used in an Audubon Society video.   He was also known among fans for his ``I Will Take You Home,'' alullaby written for his two daughters.   Mydland was born in Germany to American parents stationed therewith the military and grew up in the San Francisco Bay area,McNally said.   As a teen-ager, Mydland played with small local rock 'n' rollbands. He eventually made his name as the keyboard player with the1970s rock band Silver.   Mydland joined the Grateful Dead in April 1979 after a stintwith lead guitarist and vocalist Bob Weir's side band Bobby and theMidnights.   He replaced keyboardist Keith Godchaux, who died a year afterleaving the band.   The band's second keyboard player, Ron ``Pig Pen'' McKernan,died in the early 1970s at the age of 27.   Mydland is survived by his wife, Lisa, and his daughters.</TEXT></DOC>
