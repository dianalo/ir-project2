Or are we going to have such good developer tools that they willgive us operating system independence? Can we leave the plumbing to somebodyelse? I keep hearing about things that are cross OS for developing userinterfaces or that you only need to write to the network.andP;  How true is that?andM;David  Liddle, Metaphor Computer Systems: Metaphor is doing a differentdesign than generally has been done.andP;  Our objective is to have the Metaphorworkstation manager and high-level base work interchangeably in PM, Motif,NextStep and other environments like that.andM;Dyson: How is it? Is it real?andM;Liddle: The idea is to make a job real hard and do it once so apps developersdon't face the problem again and again.andP;  Some of the classic APIs arepresent.andP;  I know I'm focusing on user tools here; I don't mean to be sospecific.andP;  But as an example, the Macintosh started with 400 or 500 APIs foran application developer.andP;  There are more than that available in PM, Windowsand so on.andP;  But those can be grouped and seen in a more abstract way so thatthey're not really all that complex.andP;  That's the flavor of what we've triedto do.andP;  It restrains some of your choices, hut at the same time simplifiesthe set of abstractions.andP;  What you're talking about,  Esther, is practical.andO;It's a very big job, and understanding of it is only starting to emerge.andP;  Butit's not in conflict with what's been done up until now.andP;  It's just anextension of the system software that's been built in the past.andM;Dennis L.andP;  McEvoy, Cooperative Solutions: The problem is that you have to useyour example, Dave.andP;  You don't want to take a least common denominatorapproach, and you can't afford to take a greatest common multiple approachand fill in the missing pieces.andP;  So you have to come up with an abstractionappropriate for what you're doing and map it onto those various interfaces.andO;From the user's perspective, having PM, Windows and Motif all have the samelook and feel is wonderful.andP;  From the developer's perspective, it's threeseparate implementations and three separate APIs.andP;  A lot of work in each oneis horrible.andP;  Do we put up with that forever or is something going to happen?andO;Is there going to be a super API that implements the PM look-and-feel? Couldsomebody make money at that? Interesting questions.andP;  I don't know whetherthere are any answers.andM;Dyson: Somebody could, and nobody seems to be around.andP;  Enzo, your turn andthen ...andP;  come up to the mike from the audience...andM;Enzo  Torresi, NetFRAME: From the point of view of the common API on UNIX,obviously Motif has been provided.andP;  It does provide an API, not just on aparticular UNIX, but on various versions of UNIX.andP;  It also provides acapability on any operating system that has a server on it so you canactually move it across on a VMS.andP;  You can move it to a mutation of OS/2 andso on but the API issue is a problem.andM;Look-and-feel is the thing about the API.andP;  There is going to be a lot ofactivity in how we conform to an API.andP;  The problem is that any performancewill result in compromise, which means that people who have committed toDEC's APT will have to change the programs to satisfy whatever compromisesolution actually occurs.andP;  Maybe there will be a super API which sits on topof individual APIS.andP;  The problem is that once people have committed, theydon't want to change, and there are a lot who have committed to GUT APIs inone form or another.andM;William N.andP;  Joy, Sun Microsystems: The problem with all those user interfacesis that they aren't complete designs.andP;  They don't enforce enough of ametaphor, so that users switching between applications in PM, Windows orMotif find little consistency.andP;  There's no common desktop metaphor common toall those platforms.andP;  As Dave touched on in his talk, people will bedisappointed in the end by the terrible incompleteness of the user interfacesdesign.andP;  Open Look and NextStep do a better job of providing the completedesign, but the rush to get these other products to market has, to use anApple term, &quot;compromised the user experience.&quot;andM;Robert S.andP;  Epstein, Sybase: One of the axioms in business is: In chaos,there's profit.andP;  We're constantly asked the question, &quot;Do you wait for someparticular standard to be agreed upon while you're doing it, or do youproceed to do it and innovate afterward?&quot; In certain layers like networkprotocols and things like that we've created our own with the idea that wecan replace the missed things and merge.andP;  In our environment you log in toour server because we can't trust the operating system to log you incorrectly.andP;  There's really no log-in to DOS per se.andM;We work with LAN Manager effectively because it has log-in.andP;  The obviousthing for us to do is to merge both of those.andP;  If you want to trust the LANManager log-in - a reasonable thing to do - than we hide that.andP;  It's possibleto hide the complexity beneath an API even if it's a Sybase API andeventually expose that to the real one.andP;  It seems impossible to have a commonAPI with the user interface that will work across all the environments whichdoesn't effectively emasculate the environment.andP;  People will have to writevery specifically on the desktop.andP;  I agree with what was said earlier aboutthe server: There's a lot more flexibility and a lot less concern.andM;McEvoy: We need a lot more in client/server tools to enable client/serverapplications.andP;  For instance, Saros has a nice distributed file system withaccess control lists and transparency across multiple servers and archives.andO;They've built their plumbing.andP;  We have to build our own plumbing fortransactions with client/server transprocessing and for transaction-levelsecurity.andP;  But how will we make them more readily available to everybody sothey don't have to be reinvented for client/server connection?andM;Dyson: I don't know.andP;  We talk about it, and let the best guy win.andM;Ronan D.andP;  McGrath, Canadian National Railways: A quick message from acustomer.andP;  When it comes to new technologies, we class ourselves asconservative early adopters.andP;  While undoubtedly we're headed to OS/2Presentation Manager, SQL Server and front-end tools, it's going to be a longtime before a lot of the transaction processing applications are going downinto that environment.andP;  Our learning curve win move into OS/2 PresentationManager, new tools and upgraded spreadsheets.andP;  Getting a standard userinterface is sufficiently challenging so that moving original data from thosenetworks up to our mainframe is not even on our agenda for at least two orthree years.andP;  From talking to our customers, it's clear that some of thethings we're talking about this morning are not on short-term agendas.andP;  We'restill at a point where some of these applications are moving from the goodold character-based world.andM;Dyson: So you're saying we should stop working on the new stuff?andM;McGrath: Absolutely not.andP;  But I wouldn't minimize the cultural implicationsof such things as security issues for transactions in corporations who stillhave big mainframe systems.andP;  Certainly when we talk to mainframe packagedevelopers it appears to be a fair guide between where they are and wheresome of the micro developers are.andP;  We don't yet see enough dialogue betweenthose folks and the people at this Forum.andM;McEvoy: It's interesting to see the people who are moving transactionprocessing in that direction.andP;  It's Mark Teflian and company.andP;  It's MaxHopper and Harry Lyons.andP;  Those are the people who started it in the  60s.andO;They're moving it to client/server first.andP;  Bank of America has replacedalmost an its 3270s with SXs.andP;  We're starting to see the beginning of thewave.andP;  It's the deep-pocket guys who can afford to do it even though theplumbing isn't all in place.andP;  The plumbing will come into place.andP;  Then morepeople will move there because the cost advantages are overwhelming comparedwith doing it on a mainframe.andM;Dyson: Even if you charge the early adopters more?andM;Epstein: We're often asked: What year will client/server computing start?andO;That really annoys me because we have an installed base of about 1000, andabout 800 of them are doing client/server computing.andP;  The question is not:When will it start? The questions are: Where does it spread first? And howdoes it get there? A good example is the brokerage industry where about 100companies have invested in client/server computing.andP;  They need bit-maps todisplay a lot of information that doesn't fit in a character world or a DOSworld.andP;  Many are using UNIX; a number are starting to use OS/2.andP;  Once they'rein that world, they start to think about the application from a client/serverperspective.andP;  Another category involves a fraud system, which we're involvedwith on the positive side.andM;Dyson: You're doing it?andM;[Laughter]andM;Epstein: No.andP;  They're finding us.andP;  An airline, which needs to display ticketimages, and an insurance company.andP;  They need to display the originaldocument, look for specific patterns and then react.andP;  In order to displaythat they need to have a workstation.andP;  In this particular case it was an RT.andO;I can't remember the hardware they ended up putting in the other, but thatcreated the demand.andP;  Once they were in the distributed environment, theirnext question was, &quot;This is pretty neat.andP;  How do I incorporate in the nextpiece of data? How do I tie it back to my old systems?&quot; I agree with whatBill says about the evolution of this.andP;  Coming up with one compelling reasonwhy you need a workstation with bit-map capabilities gives you the firstapplication.andP;  The rest takes care of itself.andM;Dyson: Okay.andP;  Can we talk about things like object-oriented programs? How dothey tie in with operating systems? Are they going to be OS-independent? Arewe going to need standards in them? Bill?andM;William  Gates, Microsoft: A lot of the tools provided for pc developmentcome from companies like Microsoft and Borland.andP;  Everybody in that businesswill offer object libraries that have graphical end-user interface-typeobjects.andP;  How many environments they end up being able to execute thoseobject libraries in efficiently is a real question because of the leastcommon denominator and efficiency problems.andP;  It's particularly acute acrossthe Mac to Windows or OS/2.andP;  The key reason you haven't seen a tool thatmagically lets you develop for all these environments is that most of theseenvironments are very low volume.andM;People have tended to optimize their Mac or their DOS application.andP;  Thatduality will continue.andP;  Certainly Borland and Microsoft are working ongraphical-object libraries.andP;  It's not an area ripe for standardization in thenext two or three years.andM;Dyson: This is a good time for a survey.andP;  How many want separate objectlibraries for Mac and for OS/2? Martin  Goetz,  Goetz Associates: Whatobjects? I'd like to see a standard object model in the OS and perhaps thatcould he the glue for the APIS.andP;  I'm not sure there's ever going to bestandard window, scroll bar and bending-bar objects.andP;  I'm not sure you'reasking -  Dyson: I'm asking would you like that or would you want them to hedifferent so you can get the best of each world separately and write twice orthree times or four times? This is serious as Mike said.andP;  Instead of thinkingabout object libraries, we should let graphics develop and build the thingsmissing from the overall environment.andP;  This would be a standard object modelfor everything.andP;  Once you had one standard protocol for - let's call themclasses - then as we go down the format and Windows is different from Mac, wecould deal with it.andP;  But if you don't have some standard object model at all,I don't see how you could ever have separate object libraries.andP;  Does thatseem crazy or -  Goetz: You can have standard object libraries without havingthe things Dave talks about.andP;  Aldus uses something internally that lets themdevelop across Mac, Windows and OS/2.andP;  We have something internally that letsus develop across those environments.andP;  Esther's asking would somebody buysuch a thing?andM;Dyson: Yes.andP;  Would you like Bill to sell it to you?andM;McEvoy: Would you sell it?andM;Gates: At some point we might, but it's not as if you just take one sourcecode and recompile it to the different environments.andP;  About 20 percent of thework is still environment-specific.andP;  It's one of those things that's hard tosell without over promising.andP;  We should figure out a way to solve that.andM;Dyson: Give it to everybody as a beta product.andM;A voice:  Esther?andM;Dyson: Yes? Is this relevant, John?andM;John Warnock, Adobe Systems: There would be an enormous interest in tools toaid developers in going across platforms.andP;  Bill, I will even mentionsomething heretical.andP;  There would be developers willing to license it andgive you a piece of the action.andM;Dyson: Guess who?andM;Gates: Okay.andP;  That would make it worthwhile.andM;[Laughter]andM;Dyson: Please raise your hands if you'd like me to give Bin the mailing listof this conference and have him offer you a - Raise your hands, please.andP;  Howmany people want, what do you call that, Bill? Your cross...andM;Gates: Core technology run-time libraries.andM;Dyson: Core technology run-time libraries.andP;  Okay.andP;  I see a market for youhere, Bill.andP;  I'm serious.andP;  These are the problems most developers face.andP;  AtStewart's conference it was just whine, whine, whine; complain, complain,complain, &quot;We have to write for too many different environments.&quot; This is 80percent of the solution.andP;  Would the panel explain why this isn't a reasonablebusiness proposition for Bill and why he hasn't done it already?andM;Epstein: It's a reasonable business proposition.andP;  But I return to the problemof distinguishing the added value among these three different platforms ifyou neuter them to look identical.andP;  If there really is no added value, I havea problem understanding it.andP;  About 40 percent of our engineering costs dealwith the differences among machines.andP;  We run in 28 environments.andP;  I have acompetitor that claims three times that, which I don't consider an advantage.andO;If all these environments were identical, then I would save that 40 percent.andO;But is there then some intrinsic value to differentiate them? I'm spendingthat money because that's my value-added, that portability.andM;Dyson: You're right in part but much of the reason people favor one platformor another has more to do with history than with what they would pick if theywere starting fresh.andM;Liddle: To a certain extent,  Esther, that depends on what you're defining asa platform.andP;  This is a very tricky issue.andP;  it's really a double-edged sword.andO;At Metaphor we do a core technology because we have a 68000 product line, andwe have a product that IBM sells on the PS/2.andP;  We certainly can't afford twoseparate versions of a million source lines.andP;  We've gone to a lot of troubleto refine that to the low level and focus those machine-dependentdifferences.andP;  As we begin to do this, we do give up some importantadvantages.andP;  Our products run on the IBM 386 PS/2s, and we use the 8514/Adisplay system, which is very good if you grab it and do with it all thethings it can do.andM;But as soon as you start to do that - it's different from anything that's onthe Compaq, for example.andP;  The more you are &quot;industry standard,&quot; the more youhide the advantageous details the hardware developers invest in.andP;  That's notnecessarily bad, but it's one consideration.andP;  On the other hand, if you're asoftware developer you can't have a different skew for every possible CPU theguy's going to buy.andP;  That's one set of worrisome trade-offs.andP;  SAA providessome very interesting studies of the other side of the problem.andP;  In the caseof an ASS architecture there was an intention, as Bob said, to keep theapplication developer from worrying about which IBM architecture was beingdeveloped for.andP;  Often the level of an interface is pushed so high some thingsare impossible to do for performance reasons.andM;I like your idea,  Esther, but its applicability changes dramaticallydepending what area you're working off.andP;  I don't want to throw cold water onthe proposal so much as to say it's a two-edged sword.andM;McEvoy: We can take a lesson from the past.andP;  Aren't there things in theinstruction set that make UNIX run better on one machine than another? Nobodyasks this anymore.andP;  They just have to have UNIX, regardless of theinstruction set MIPS, SPARC, whatever.andM;Dyson: Bill?andM;Joy: I don't have anything I want to say.andM;[Laughter]andM;Joy: Well, I just asked Bill, &quot;This is portable? The thing supports UNIX aswell as Mac and DOS and OS/2?&quot;andM;Gates: We have approached it like this is a thing we use.andM;Joy: But as it's used, does it support UNIX as well?andM;Gates: I don't know what you mean by UNIX.andM;[Laughter]andM;Joy: Then use whatever word you mean if you said UNIX?andM;Gates: I wouldn't mean much.andP;  I might mean SCO or System V. You should ask meNextStep, Open Look, ATandamp;T, Open Look, Motif, like that.andP;  And the answer isno.andM;Joy: For all of them?andM;Gates: That's correct.andM;Joy: So the answer to the original question was no.andM;Gates: There's a simple answer.andP;  We don't know how to make money inlow-volume environments.andP;  So we have not gone to the effort to create a toolto build applications in environments we don't know how to make money in.andM;Joy: It was a technical question.andM;Gates: So the answer is no.andP;  Could it be done? Oh, absolutely, it could bedone.andP;  In the next year or two all sorts of companies will come out withtools that claim to give you portability from anything to anything.andP;  Somewill deliver that capability in varying degrees.andP;  Some will do it by havingprocedural interfaces that map down into the other ones.andP;  Others will try andabstract up to the object level.andP;  It's not a simple thing.andP;  There aresignificant efficiency issues that come up in trying to remap a system into asingle set of APIS.andM;Dyson: To follow up on Bill  Joy's question, for both David and Bill.andP;  Thething you have, is it very specific to those two environments or is it a moregeneral transformation thing?andM;Gates: You pick your common API set and you're always biased.andP;  The ultimateis to say, &quot;I am going to take the Windows' APT and I'm going to run that onOS/2 or I'm going to run that on Mac.andP;  Or you take the Mac API and say, &quot;I'mgoing to run that on Windows or that on OS/2.&quot; With things like byte-swappingor cases where one is low-level and the other high-level, you'll always comeat it with a bias.andP;  In our case our bias is a hybrid-made Windows' bias.andP;  Soit's particularly good on those systems because we sell a lot of applicationsthat we want to run fast on those systems.andP;  But it could be mapped toanything.andP;  I mean a button's a button.andP;  So technically it's feasible.andM;Joy: To return to Dave  Liddle's point in his talk that the important thingis for such a tool kit to support preservation of the metaphors.andP;  They areincomplete on some of the platforms, specifically under Motif and PM as Imentioned before, and also conflict as some of his slides showed.andP;  If we havea common tool kit which abandons the metaphor on platforms where it iscomplete, I don't think people are going to find those applicationssatisfactory.andM;Gates: What are you talking about, Bill?andM;Joy: We'll drop this topic for proper treatment of icons as Dave discussed inhis talk.andP;  If the platform does it properly and then has an application witha portable tool kit which improves it, people will go slightly crazy.andP;  It'sgoing to create the Jekyll- and-Hyde phenomenon.andP;  Environments that haveevolved, as opposed to those that have been designed, generally don't handlethese things properly.andP;  A new clean design, like a NextStep, has a betterchance of handling the constants presented and doing so consistently than onethat had layer after layer added.andP;  The tool kit's going to be compromised andany applications are compromised as well.andM;Gates: Great.andP;  Then I shouldn't do it.andP;  Your platform is too superior for usto do things for it.andM;[Applause]andM;That's what you're saying and that's exactly what Apple would say if Applewas to say, &quot;Don't least common denominator this thing.andP;  Write applicationsspecific for the Mac.&quot; That's what you're saying for the Sun platform.andP;  It'sa legitimate point of view and both developments will continue where you say,&quot;There are millions of this machine out there.andP;  I'm going to do the best Ican do on this machine.andP;  &quot; It doesn't mean you should use a differentdevelopment language, but it means you'll have to do significantre-engineering of the user interface of your application in the foreseeablefuture.andM;Joy: To say millions of those machines are out there is unfair because theydon't all have the same metaphor.andP;  In some anthropological or sociologicalsense there's a different experience because the applications and userinterfaces are different.andP;  In fact, the DOS market is so fragmented you can'taggregate the numbers.andP;  The Macintosh is a more uniform experience.andP;  When Isit down at a Mac I know what to expect from one application to the next.andO;People appreciate that integrity, and that magnifies the numbers to be farlarger than they appear in a numerical comparison.andP;  We need clean designsthat don't add multimedia to an old design but include it as a forethoughtinstead of an afterthought.andP;  I have a lot of respect for NEXT and otherstrying to do that well.andP;  We can't pretend that adding to old stuff is goingto be as good.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andP;  Well said.andP;  That was basically DaveandM;Liddle's talk.andM;Joy: I've heard it three times, and I appreciate it every time so I'm notforgetting it.andM;Dyson: It needs the examples, but that's the fundamental point: Up and downthere's this common user model that you can't lose without great -  Joy: I'llsay something as a developer.andP;  As we add more and more of these features toolder systems, the complexity gets multiplicative.andP;  I have ten differentpackages that interact in ten to the tenth different ways.andP;  I get all sortsof surprises, and yet because these things don't play together well the poweris only additive.andP;  I get this feature and that feature but the combinationsdon't work.andP;  What I'd really like to see is a system where the complexitygoes up in a linear way but the power goes up exponentially.andP;  That happensonly with using more computer science and more powerful consistent designs.andO;I'm not sure there's not going to be a break from the past somewhere in the 90s.andP;  Somebody will do a new design in a volume product that does thesethings well.andP;  The programmer's manual won't be 3000 or 5000 pages but 100pages.andP;  That's going to make an enormous difference to developers.andP;  I don'tmind supporting a different platform as long as it doesn't have 5000 pages ofdocumentation.andM;Dyson: Steve is clearly trying to make it into a volume machine.andP;  I don'tknow about the documentation.andM;Joy: The problem I see with the NEXT machine is it's different from UNIX, butincludes it as a subset.andP;  This makes it too complicated to start with.andM;Dyson: Okay.andP;  Let's see.andP;  Dave Brodwin?andM;David R. Brodwin, Arthur D. Little: I'd like to ask a question from thestandpoint of the customer.andP;  This is deliberately naive from a technicalstandpoint, but some important issues are being missed.andP;  There's adiscontinuity.andP;  When we talk about the individual user to individual machineexperience, we have a clear idea what that should look like and can focus ontechnical questions.andP;  But when we start talking about groups of users andorganized groups of computing resources we become almost agnostic about whatthey should look like.andP;  We wind up talking about the plumbing and how to makeit work without having a clear idea of what we're trying to achieve.andM;If we use all this technology to recreate the world where the bigbox, be itthe server or host or whatever, is just another way of hooking up thecomputing resources, we may go back from personal computing to impersonalcomputing.andP;  We let data out but we control it very tightly.andP;  Then we take theterminal and throw it away.andP;  In its place, we put in something that's glitzyand has great graphics but from the standpoint of user freedom, is stillbasically a terminal.andP;  How do we keep the user experience a personalexperience - even in the realm of shared applications and data - so there'sas much freedom as there can be? What does that mean for architectures? Whatdoes that mean for the kind of tools we need to create this next generationof computer software?andM;Dyson: That's fundamentally what we're trying to do but does anyone have aparticular response? Dennis?andM;McEvoy: To keep it as personal as possible for the user we hide the factthere are multiple machines cooperating.andP;  As soon as you share data there hasto he somebody to administer it who can see that it's multi-functional.andP;  Soin a multi-user shared environment, you can do it for the user, but not forthe administrator.andM;Dyson: Next question.andM;John  Chisholm, John  Chisholm Co.: I have a program to make a Windows-based,chemical engineering modeling package.andP;  We're very interested in porting overto other environments.andP;  We've gone over to Motif in a very generic fashion,which since I like the graphics has created a library that goes over to PM.andO;What Bill  Gates said about performance, we haven't found to be true.andP;  Mostthings have to do with user interface.andP;  The only difference is that runningon a SPARC station runs three times faster.andP;  So...andM;Gates: You're running Motif on a SPARC station?andM;Chisholm: Yes.andM;Gates: That's pretty bizarre...andM;Torresi: Why is it bizarre to run on anything...andM;Gates: SPARC stations generally run Open Look.andM;Chisholm: It took us about two months to do it.andP;  As a commercial developer,it's not a major problem to do something like that.andP;  I thought I should letpeople know this since they sound interested in this kind of activity.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andP;  Great.andP;  Bob Berland.andP;  Robert F. Berland, IBM: I have twoof the major host software companies under contract developing cooperativeprocessing.andP;  As an industry we are doing a terrible job of getting across thevalue of OS/2.andP;  Not its functionality, but its value as a cooperativeprocessing environment and many of the things Bill alluded to.andP;  If you sawthe exciting things these developers are doing and how they're evolving theirapplications for corporate America, you'd have a very different view of thepotential.andP;  I'm worried that unless we work hard to articulate this betterwe're going to make Vittorio Cassoni's words come true.andP;  We're going to slowthe industry down by talking to ourselves in the negative.andM;There are tools today that customers could be bringing up and using for theirapplications without the view that you have to rewrite everything fromscratch.andP;  I can ten you this for sure because one of the toughest companiesto move is IBM, and we're putting OS/2 and its power in front of existingapplications without any change to the back-end whatsoever.andP;  We're gettingmany of the benefits Bill and IBM are trying to deliver.andP;  There are toolscorporate America could use immediately.andP;  There's a tool we use called ISOthat the IS shops could use to gain experience and get the benefit today.andO;Unless we do a better job as an industry of tying in, we're going to makesure this industry slows down.andM;Jeffrey G. Bonar, GUIdance Technologies: We offer another one of those toolscalled Choreographer, which, well, I'll leave the partisanship to anothertime.andP;  Something is being missed here.andP;  The two most popular applications -word processing and spreadsheets - don't use a standard look-and-feel.andP;  Withword processing you want to do stuff with the words.andP;  It's on new metaphors.andO;And it's the same thing with a spreadsheet.andP;  It's not a standard metaphor.andO;It lives inside a standard window or whatever, but it's not a standardmetaphor.... Part of the problem is that the APIs are low level.andP;  They'rethis word-space model, and the object models are missing from the APIs, ormost of them anyway.andP;  We need tools to bridge the gap.andP;  What makes thetranslation so hard is that the APIs are so much lower level than what theapplications are actually doing.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andP;  This is an interesting question.andP;  Someone talked about myenvironment XyWrite.andP;  Yeah, I might have different abstractions of the realworld and of my XyWrite model of the world, but at least I only have onemodel which is consistent in itself.andM;Joy: A spreadsheet is a metaphor.andP;  It's just not implemented properly in anyof the systems we have.andP;  You can't put icons from your finder in aspreadsheet, because the thing's not done properly.andP;  There are lots of thingsyou could do with a spreadsheet model.andP;  Some of the securities agencies havebeen putting bizarre things in spreadsheet cells.andP;  You can put sound in adocument in a NEXT machine.andP;  People think that's amazing but it's just anexample that the notion of a document is a metaphor and the objects can go inthe document.andP;  All these things should work, and it should be obvious thatthey all work.andP;  It's just that the systems aren't implemented properly.andM;Dyson: Do you have a comment, Bill? About Excel or something the....andM;Gates: No.andP;  I'm just surprised how many things are improper, that's all.andM;Dyson: Improper?andM;Gates: Improperly done.andM;Joy: I was making a technical comment.andM;Gates: Okay.andM;Dyson: Okay.andP;  Thank you all very much, panel.andM;[Applause]andM;Get those business cards for Bill.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
