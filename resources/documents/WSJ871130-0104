Rather, it was another demonstration that money and deception can go a long way in a political campaign.    Maine Yankee supporters spent $6 million during the campaign -- more than $50 for every &quot;yes&quot; vote -- telling voters that closing the plant would lead to higher electric bills. But the 60-second television commercials didn't tell voters the full story.    A report by Public Citizen, &quot;Too Costly to Continue: The Economic Feasibility of a Nuclear Phase-Out,&quot; found that continuing to operate existing nuclear plants, such as Maine Yankee, is costing as much as double what the industry claims. The nuclear industry grossly underestimates the cost for major repairs, nuclear-waste disposal and decommissioning. It also generally ignores the fact that operating costs rise as plants age. For example, over the past 15 years, operating costs have risen 10% faster than the rate of inflation. Since 1981, the estimated cost for testing potential nuclear-waste dumps has increased twentyfold. And operating costs at older plants are double those at newer reactors.    The nuclear industry has failed to deliver on its promise of cheap and reliable energy. A $6 million political campaign cannot erase that failure.
