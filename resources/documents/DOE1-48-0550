This corresponds to an area of about 5 x 5 {mu}m in a5-{mu}m bubble garnet film. The sequential VBL propagation induced byz-field pulsing was demonstrated directly by means of a simple test chipwith current VBL confinement, and a current loop for the drive pulsesas main features. VBL detection is simply carried out by exciting thedomain wall, which resonance signal vanishes when a VBL is present. Thestripe is stabilized inside a 10% groove. Moreover, the local wall massas well as the restoring constant could be inferred from the resonanceline shape. The first WRS experiment with very high local resolution(2 {mu}m) applied to localized stripe domains clearly demonstrates itspotential usefulness for device testing, error mode detection, and optimization.</TEXT></DOC>
