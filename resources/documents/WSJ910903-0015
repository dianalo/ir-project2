But corporate treasurers don't expect long-term rates tofall much below 8%, and so a lot of corporations have beentapping the debt market or are planning to do so in the weeksahead.</LP><TEXT>   In the treasurers' view, corporate borrowing costs alreadyhave fallen about as far as they will go, and might evenlurch back up again later this year.   &quot;There is more of an upside risk than a downside potentialin interest rates today,&quot; says Louis Lipschitz, treasurer atToys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc. The company, which hadn't raised money inthe bond market since February 1987, recently issued $200million of debentures yielding 8.75%.   Like many corporations, the Paramus, N.J.-based toy makersold debt because it believes long-term bond yields are neartheir historic lows. In the past 10 years, long-termgovernment bond yields have rarely fallen below 8%. &quot;Ifhistory has anything to do with it,&quot; says Mr. Lipschitz, &quot;Idon't think {Treasury} rates are going to drop much below8.05%,&quot; the level prevailing at the time of the Toys &quot;R&quot; Usdebt sale.   The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to8.06% Friday, after briefly sinking below the 8% mark earlierin the week.   Some corporate treasurers think that interest rates willcontinue to fluctuate widely in the decade ahead. That's whymany of them are quick to take advantage of rates, especiallywhen they're near their historic lows.   &quot;I don't think interest rates are going to be a lotdifferent in the next 10 to 15 years than they were duringthe past 10 to 15 years,&quot; says Karol Emmerich, treasurer atDayton-Hudson Corp., &quot;which means they are going to continueto be volatile, and continue to be higher relative to therate of inflation than they were in the '50s and '60s.&quot;   Early last month, Dayton-Hudson sold $100 million of20-year debentures yielding 9.31%.   Much more than short-term rates, long-term rates areswayed by the outlook for price inflation and borrowingdemand. Only moderate inflation is expected this year, butsome corporate treasurers say today's long-term yieldsalready reflect this.   Even if the Fed does reduce short-term rates by 1/4percentage point soon, &quot;that wouldn't yield us a significantchange&quot; in borrowing costs, says William Armstrong, treasurerat Ingersoll-Rand Co., a Woodcliff Lake, N.J., machinerymaker.   Companies that wait much longer to take advantage of thebond market's recent strength run the risk of missing a goodopportunity, he contends. By waiting, &quot;you have a greaterexposure to rates moving back up, as they did in the spring.&quot;Ingersoll-Rand issued $125 million of 30-year debentures inmid-August. Those debentures yielded 9%.   Investment bankers agree that when long-term Treasury bondyields fall to the 8% area, it's generally a good time forcompanies to tap the bond market. &quot;Anybody who has used 8%{on Treasury bonds} as a rule of thumb {on when to issue newdebt} hasn't been wrong for the last three to five years,&quot;says Joseph Cook, head of the taxable fixed-income syndicatedesk at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.   As borrowing costs have fallen this summer, many companiesalready have rushed to take advantage of the debt market'sstrength. In the past two months alone, companies have issuedmore than $20 billion of nonconvertible debt, according toSecurities Data Co. That is up sharply from $13.4 billion inthe same 1990 period and $18.4 billion the year before.   Many more companies are likely to issue debt this month,investment bankers say. &quot;I think you're going to see a prettybig calendar&quot; of new corporate debt issues in September, saysPeter Milhaupt, a director in capital markets at First BostonCorp.   This week, however, the main focus in the credit marketswill be on the government's employment report, due out earlyFriday. If it paints as grim a picture of the economy as theJuly report did, economists and bond traders say, the FederalReserve probably will move swiftly to cut both the discountrate and the federal funds rate. Both rates now stand at5.5%.   Economists figure the Fed might cut its discount rate,which is what it charges on loans to banks and savingsinstitutions, by 1/2 percentage point, to 5%. And they thinkthe Fed might lower the federal funds rate, charged onovernight loans between banks, by 1/4 point, to 5.25%.   Such cuts probably would persuade banks to lower their8.5% prime lending rates to 8.25% or possibly even 8%,economists predict. The prime is the rate many banks use as abenchmark for loans to small and medium-sized businesses. Alower prime would be good news for many individual borrowersbecause rates on home-equity loans and some credit-card loansare tied directly to the prime.   Even if the employment report is ambiguous, severaleconomists urge the Fed to move swiftly to cut rates. Theyargue that there are more than enough other signs of economicand financial strains, such as anemic money-supply growth andfalling commodity prices, to justify another round of ratecutting by the Fed.   Economists generally expect the Labor Department's reportto show only slight gains in U.S. employment last month. Theyalso expect the report to show an increase in the civilianunemployment rate, to 6.9% from 6.8% in July.   &quot;There is already a bias among Fed officials to loweringrates, but they won't pull the trigger {to cut rates} unlessthe economic data come in on the soft side,&quot; said RobertDederick, executive vice president at Northern Trust Co. inChicago.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Treasury bond prices slumped, erasing part of their largegains earlier in the week.   Traders attributed the setback to a batch of unexpectedlystrong economic reports. Among actively traded issues, theTreasury's 30-year bond ended at 100 25/ 32, down about 5/8point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount, from lateThursday in New York. The yield, which moves in the oppositedirection as the price, rose to 8.06% from 8.01%.   Prices of investment-grade corporate bonds andmortgage-backed securities ended slightly lower. Tax-exemptmunicipal bond prices were flat to down slightly. Butcorporate high-risk, high-yield junk bonds advanced.   Despite the latest economic data, Stephen Slifer,executive vice president at Lehman Brothers, said the FederalReserve may cut short-term interest rates another notch ifthe employment report to be released Friday morning shows theeconomy is faltering.   &quot;There is no question they {Fed officials} would go&quot; andcut short-term rates if the employment report is weak, Mr.Slifer said. He added that the Fed has to consider otherworrisome signs in the economy, including the automobile andhousing sectors. Those two sectors, which appeared to bebouncing back, have lost momentum.   Trading was light Friday as most government bond tradingdesks closed at 2 p.m. EDT, in accordance withrecommendations of the Public Securities Association, a tradegroup. U.S. financial markets were closed yesterday inobservance of Labor Day.   Government bonds started sliding early in the day afterthe Commerce Department reported a 1.2% increase in its indexof leading indicators in July. That was the largest increasein the index, which is designed to forecast economicactivity, in three years.   Bond prices fell further with the release of the Julyfactory orders report and the August Chicago-area purchasingmanagers' survey.   In the corporate junk bond market, the biggest gainerswere issues of Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc. Theseissues soared on news that the company will recommend to itsstockholders and its board of directors a merger withCoca-Cola Enterprises Inc.   Johnston Coca-Cola's 11.50% subordinated notes, due in2001, gained 2 points to end at 105.</TEXT></DOC>
