But his medical record may permanently brandhim as undesirable to insurers and employers.   Joshua has been diagnosed as suffering from an inheriteddisorder called polycystic kidney disease. But he's notreally suffering. The disease, which damages the kidneys,usually doesn't cause health problems before adulthood andmay progress slowly even then.</LP><TEXT>   Yet when Joshua's father recently changed jobs, the newemployer's health insurer wouldn't cover the child because ofhis predisposition to the disease. &quot;We finally got healthinsurance for Josh&quot; with a different insurer, says hismother, &quot;but we didn't tell the company about his disease.&quot;   Joshua's case illustrates an issue usually raised only byexperts gazing darkly into crystal balls and foreseeing theclassification of people by their genes. A number of similarcases have surfaced, suggesting that the issue already ishitting home. Besides grappling with insurance problems,people known to have disease-associated genes reportedly havebeen denied jobs and the chance to adopt children.   Such anecdotal reports -- circulated among geneticsexperts recently -- aren't &quot;hard evidence&quot; that geneticdiscrimination is occurring, cautions Philip Reilly, head ofBoston's Shriver Center for Mental Retardation. &quot;But concernis appropriate. . . . The reports may be very early warningsigns&quot; of discrimination, which &quot;could be a big problem 10years from now, when we might have 100 tests for geneticdiseases.&quot; Such tests could put millions of people intohigh-risk disease categories, branding them for insurance andemployment purposes in much the same way those diagnosed withAIDS infections are often marked.   Health and life insurance companies typically requireaccess to the medical records of people seeking coverage andask about pre-existing medical conditions; people who don'tdisclose such conditions risk losing their insurance.   Research advances of the past decade already have vastlyamplified doctors' ability to diagnose and sometimes palliatedisorders caused by faulty genes. But cures generally remainyears or decades away. Meanwhile, insurers and employers --squeezed by soaring health-care costs -- are trying harder tominimize financial risks posed by chronic, costly diseases.Improved tests for genetic diseases give them new, powerfultools for limiting their exposure to those risks.   &quot;If an individual had undergone genetic tests and hadinformation about them, an insurer would want to know&quot; whenmaking coverage decisions about the person, says Jude Payne,a senior policy analyst for the Health Insurance Associationof America, a trade group. &quot;While some people might considerthat discrimination, the insurance industry would consider itstandard policy.&quot;   But testing for a genetic disease typically gives aprediction of illness that says little about the course ofthe disease and the costs it might entail. The age of onsetand the severity of gene-associated diseases vary widely dueto patients' differing life styles, treatments andlittle-understood effects of the &quot;expression&quot; of genes. It's&quot;cockeyed&quot; to base insurance or employment decisions on suchhazy predictions, argues Paul Billings, who directs geneticsat Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco.   That, however, is just what a number of insurers and otherorganizations are starting to do, according to a survey ofgeneticists and other medical professionals that Mr. Billingsrecently conducted with three other researchers. Among 29cases of &quot;genetic discrimination&quot; reported to them were onesin which:   -- A patient diagnosed as carrying a gene for Gaucher'sdisease was denied a government job because of the diagnosisdespite the fact that the patient wasn't expected to getsick. The disease, which causes liver enlargement and otherproblems, occurs only in people whose cells each have twocopies of its &quot;recessive&quot; gene -- one from each parent.   -- A pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with cysticfibrosis was told by her health maintenance organization thatit wouldn't cover the child's medical expenses. The HMO laterreversed the decision after the woman complained.   -- A couple's application to adopt a child was deniedbecause one spouse had a family history of Huntington'sdisease and was at risk for the inherited disorder, a fataldisease that causes progressive mental degeneration.   Insurers question the validity of such anonymousanecdotes, which may omit or distort crucial facts. And evenif genetic discrimination sometimes occurs, anecdotal reportssay nothing about its prevalence. &quot;I really disagree . . .that there is rampant discrimination,&quot; says Robert Pokorski,chairman of the American Council of Life Insurance's genetictesting committee. &quot;Insurance companies can't make money bydenying risk.&quot;   Moreover, in a preliminary study at Johns HopkinsUniversity, researchers found that people withneurofibromatosis, a genetic disease that can causedisfigurement, &quot;lacked insurance at about the same rate asthe general population,&quot; says Reed Pyeritz, who led thestudy.   Still, many medical experts worry that rapidlyproliferating genetic tests are cracking open a Pandora'sbox. More than 4,000 genetic disorders have been identified,and tests for dozens of them are now possible. (For economicand other reasons, many potential tests aren't yet practicalfor wide use.)   The dizzying pace of genetic findings is expected toaccelerate further as the $3 billion federal Human GenomeProject, which is aimed at identifying all 100,000 or sohuman genes, takes off in the coming year. Among otherthings, the 15-year project promises to elucidate genes thatcontribute to major scourges such as heart disease, cancerand Alzheimer's disease. &quot;The insurance issues raised bygenetic screening are about to grow phenomenally,&quot; says HarryOstrer, a geneticist at the University of Florida.   Currently, all 50 states require screening of newborns forcertain diseases, including genetic ones. And optionalprenatal testing for genetic disorders is surging.   Last year Kim Roembach-Ratliff of Prairie Village, Kan.,had prenatal tests that showed her son would be born withspina bifida, a crippling disorder associated with faultygenes in which part of the spinal column is exposed. Aboutthe same time, her husband applied for health coverage underhis new employer's insurer.   &quot;When we called the agent {for the new insurer},&quot; shesays, &quot;he told me, `I'm sorry, we can't extend insurance toyou'&quot; because of her child's expected health problems. Thoseproblems have turned out to be relatively minor, she adds,and her six-month-old son probably will be able to walk withleg braces. Meanwhile, the couple has been able to get an18-month extension of coverage under the previous employer'shealth insurance program.   In Columbia, Mo., Mark Gibson, a manager with AmericanFidelity Assurance who handled the couple's application, saysit was denied because the spina bifida diagnosis representeda &quot;pre-existing&quot; medical condition not coverable under thecompany's rules.   Most tests for genetic diseases are now done prenatally orat birth. But there may soon be more testing of adults,partly because of a trend toward self-insurance amongemployers. (Self-insured companies directly fund theiremployee's health plans.) Such employers &quot;have a strongincentive to find out about employees' health risks,&quot;including genetic diseases, says Deborah Stone, a BrandeisUniversity professor of law and social policy.   Few, if any, employers are believed to be testing workersfor genetic diseases. But a federal study indicated that morethan half of employers medically screen job applicants, andmany companies request access to medical records that maycontain the results of genetic tests.   Fearful of being denied insurance or other things, somepeople who suspect they carry disease-associated genes --perhaps because of family histories of a disease -- declineto use new tests that could put black marks on their medicalrecords. &quot;We get about a call a day from people asking aboutgetting tested for Huntington's disease,&quot; says Richard Myers,who directs a testing program for the disease at Boston'sMassachusetts General Hospital. &quot;But we only do about threeor four tests a year.&quot; One reason is that a Huntington's testcan cost $3,000 to $4,000. But &quot;the greatest deterrent togetting tested,&quot; he adds, &quot;is that it makes people feel morevulnerable to losing whatever protection they now have&quot; viajobs or insurance.   Currently, &quot;the legal protections against geneticdiscrimination are quite fuzzy,&quot; says Brandeis's Ms. Stone.It's unclear, for example, whether laws barringdiscrimination by employers and insurers against people withdisabilities apply to people with genetic diseases.   Laws to protect people with medical problems don't alwayswork, anyway. &quot;AIDS testing by employers is illegaleverywhere, but it's still done by some companies,&quot; says MarkRothstein, a University of Houston authority on medicalscreening.   Some states have set up &quot;high-risk&quot; pools for insuringpeople who can't get commercial health insurance, typicallyfunded in part by insurers. But the pools probably would beoverwhelmed by the number of risky cases potentiallyidentifiable through genetic testing. &quot;Ultimately,&quot; says theShriver Center's Dr. Reilly, &quot;the best solution to theproblem may be some sort of national health insurance.&quot;   ---         Prevalence of Some Genetic Diseases                                                                                                          Estimates of the number of Americans having diseases witha genetic cause or an important genetic ingredient:                                                                                                        DISEASE                INCIDENCE        NATURE OF ILLNESS                                                                                                        Adult polycystic       300,000 to       Kidney damage and kidney disease         400,000          failure                                                                                                        Down's syndrome        250,000          Range of mental                                         retardation                                                                                                        Sickle-cell            50,000           Impaired anemia                                  circulation,                                         anemia, pain                                                                                                        Cystic fibrosis        30,000           Chronic respiratory                                         infections and                                         digestive problems                                                                                                        Huntington's           25,000           Progressive mental disease                                 and neurological                                         degeneration                                                                                                        Duchenne muscular      20,000 to        Muscular dystrophy              30,000           degeneration,                                         weakness                                                                                                        Hemophilia             20,000           Uncontrolled                                                                                                        Phenylketonuria        Below 10,000     Mental deficiency                                                                                                        Alzheimer's disease    2 to 4 million*  Progressive                                         mental degeneration                                                                                                          *Heredity may account for only a fraction of these cases.
