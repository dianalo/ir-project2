Bob Dole quit the presidential race today, threeweeks after being buried in George Bush's Super Tuesday landslide,calling himself ``bloodied but unbowed, as the poet says.'' On theDemocratic side, Michael Dukakis sought a Connecticut primaryvictory to slow Jesse Jackson.   Dole offered his congratulations to Bush, who beat him in asolid majority of primaries and said, ``Keeping the White HouseRepublican, that's the bottom line.''   Flanked by his wife, former Transportation Secretary ElizabethDole, and his daughter Robin, Dole said, ``I know, and my familyknows, that I'm a fighter, and I don't like to lose.''   ``I've been beaten before and no doubt will again. But I havenever been defeated and never will be,'' the Kansas senator said,as supporters and fellow senators applauded.   White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker Jr., a formerpresidential hopeful himself as well as a former Senate colleagueof Dole's, said he'd talked to Dole earlier, and ``I told him I'vebeen there. I know how it feels. I told him there'll be life afterthis, political life, that he has a major role to play.''   Among the Democrats, Rep. Richard Gephardt filed for re-electionto his House seat one day after dropping his own presidential bid.He told reporters in Jefferson City, Mo., ``I am very happy to behere.''   After updating based on final Michigan results and aredistribution of some of Gephardt's delegates, Dukakis held a slimseven-delegate lead over Jackson. The Massachusetts governor hopedto add to his lead today with a win in neighboring Connecticut.   In New York meanwhile, Sen. Albert Gore Jr., took a few apparentswipes at Jackson, an ordained minister known for his ringingspeeches.   In remarks to the Association for a Better New York, Gore wasapplauded when he said that in the campaign, ``we're not choosing apreacher, we're choosing a president.''   ``The Oval Office is a whole lot more than a pulpit,'' Gore said.   Referring to Jackson's calling himself ``a tree shaker, not ajelly maker,'' Gore asserted that ``in the Oval Office, some jellymust be made. Only a president who knows how big government workscan turn soaring rhetoric and lofty goals into programs andpolicies.''   Among the Republicans, even with Dole nominally still in therace, Bush was overwhelmingly favored today in his almost-homestate of Connecticut. But he said he didn't want to ``project anarrogance.''   Dukakis was also expected to do well in the primary, with 52delegates at stake. But Jackson has been drawing big, enthusiasticcrowds in the state.   ``There's nothing more powerful in the world than the peoplewhose hope has been raised,'' he said as he stumped in Connecticuton Monday.   Jackson's stunning weekend win in Michigan's caucuses putDukakis under mounting pressure. Connecticut's Democratic statechairman, John F. Droney, said that in light of Jacson's gains,Dukakis had to poll better than 50 percent in the primary toreassert himself.   Dukakis disputed whether he had to land such a knockout punchjust to stay in the ring. ``Look _ a victory is a victory,'' hesaid.   Jackson, meanwhile, was drawing admiring comment from both sidesof the political aisle on Monday. Bush, campaigning in Wisconsin,which holds its primary a week from today, went out of his way topraise him.   ``The man's racking up delegates, and that's how you getelected,'' the vice president said. ``What he has done is veryadmirable.''   Bush's comments came at a news conference in Milwaukee, where hepicked up the endorsement of Rep. Jack Kemp, a former rival. Kemp,who quit the presidential race earlier this month, said he wouldactively campaign for the vice president.   Gephardt also praised Jackson as he was closing the book on hisown Democratic candidacy. He refrained from making any formalendorsement, but said: ``I believe Jesse Jackson can be nominatedand I think he can be elected.''   Gephardt, whose campaign slid downhill after an initial win inIowa's Democratic caucuses, said he was hampered by a lack offunds. But he added: ``I have no alibis. We lost, no question aboutthat.''   Gephardt's loss was his rivals' gain. Most of his 167 delegateswent into the uncommitted column, but Missouri state party rulesmandate that the at-large and public official delegates arere-divided among the active candidates when a contender drops out.   According to the latest AP count, Dukakis had 611.55, Jackson604.55, Tennessee Sen. Gore 364.8, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon 169.5and uncommitted 508.6.   Jackson, who leads in the popular vote totals, said he expectsto emerge as the Democratic nominee if he wins the mostpre-convention delegates.   Appearing on ABC's ``Nightline'' on Monday night, he said if hewere the leader going into the convention, he did not expect thatparty leaders would use the votes of ``super delegates'' _ electedofficials and party professionals _ to keep him from getting thenomination.   ``If they used their power in that way, it would be unwise. Itwould not be right,'' he said.   On the Republican side, Bush was far, far ahead of either Doleor former television evangelist Pat Robertson, with 778 delegatesto Dole's 178 and Robertson's 17.   Even so, Bush said he didn't want to get overconfident.   ``One of the best things that happened to me was getting mybrains kicked out in Iowa,'' he said. ``Everybody had me dead andburied. We were resurrected ... So people say now things are goingpretty well for you, and they are.''</TEXT></DOC>
