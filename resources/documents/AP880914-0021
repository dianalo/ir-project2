GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Burmese army _ tough, disciplinedand hitherto loyal _ has emerged as the key power broker in anincreasingly chaotic country where the authoritarian government isbesieged by a popular revolt.   Only a few of the 186,000 soldiers have defected to join massesof protesters demanding the military-backed government step down soan interim administration can supervise the first multipartyelections in 26 years.   ``It's the only really organized force in the country. Whoevergains its loyalty controls the state,'' Burma specialist JosefSilverstein said.   ``I think the army is still 100 percent behind (formerPresident) Ne Win and (President) Maung Maung. They're in theramparts and I don't see any shift in their loyalty,'' the Americanexpert said in an interview.   The government and sole political party could not have withstoodthe last seven weeks of massive demonstrations without solidmilitary backing, analysts say. The army even has been willing togun down unarmed protesters.   The civil service, meanwhile, is bolting.   The experts speculate, however, that the military might havesplintered without behind-the-scenes maneuvering by retired leaderNe Win, architect of both the 1962 coup and the military's powerand privilege.   Diplomats in Rangoon say military units are stockpiling food,fuel and other vital supplies that are fast disappearing.   The army and other agents of the state have been reportedencouraging violence, looting and rumors _ perhaps hoping tojustify a military crackdown led by Ne Win's old guard, whichincludes Maung Maung.   But Rangoon diplomats say opposition leaders Tin Oo and AungGyi, both widely respected officers who earlier broke with Ne Win,could win the military to their side.   A third possibility is a coup by ``Young Turks'' in combatcommands who are known to have grown disillusioned with corruption,inefficiency and the high living of the elite, while troops aresent to battle rebels armed with rifles that jam in the tropicalrains.   The sole certainty is that a violent confrontation between thearmy and the opposition would result in great bloodshed.   The few weapons available to students, workers and allied groupsare knives, clubs and ``jinglees'' _ homemade, poisoned projectiles.   The army _ although one of the poorest-equipped in world _ hasbeen described by military attaches in Rangoon as ``tough, lean andmean.'' The ranks of its eight light infantry divisions are filledby some of the best foot soldiers in Asia, second only to those ofVietnam.   The army also has been imbued with what Israeli scholar andBurma expert Moshe Lissak calls a sense of ``historic mission.''   Military men, including Ne Win, gained prestige by leading thestruggle against British colonialism, and upon independence in 1948found a power vacuum they moved to fill. The army also providedprotection for the Burman, Buddhist heartland against ethnicinsurgents pressing inward from the frontier.   ``Faced by a plethora of enemies, communist and ethnicseparatists, and supported by a weak and uncertain civiliangovernment, the army leadership developed the ability to functionindependently of civilian control,'' wrote British scholar RobertTaylor in ``The State in Burma.''   Armed with definite ideas about how to run the country, Ne Win'sclique seized power in 1962. Retired colonels were charged withrunning government departments and ex-generals became ministers.   The results were political repression and economic ruin.   ``We know the end of the story now, but in the 1960s themilitary were looked upon as saviors,'' Lissak said. They became aprivileged group, with extra pay, medical care, survivor benefitsand jobs upon retirement _ special benefits they can have no desireto lose.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Denis D.
