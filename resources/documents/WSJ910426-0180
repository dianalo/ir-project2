Mr. Skinner, in announcing his decision, said that becausethe department approved the sale of only three routes --albeit the busiest and most lucrative of the six -- a newcontract will have to be negotiated between TWA and AMRCorp.'s American. &quot;This isn't a legal opinion,&quot; he said, butadded, &quot;there is no provision in there {the contract} fordownsizing.&quot; The contract called for American to pay TWA $445million for six London routes.</LP><TEXT>   The need to renegotiate the contract, Mr. Skinner said,clears the way for Los Angeles financier Kirk Kerkorian, oranyone else who's interested, to make an offer for TWA. Mr.Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. has proposed buying all of TWA for$250 million in capital and $137 million in unionconcessions, but hasn't approached the carrier directlybecause of concerns it could be sued by American forinterfering with the contract for London routes.   That obstacle was highlighted yesterday when AMR Chairmanand President Robert Crandall immediately took strongexception to Mr. Skinner's views, saying that American'scontract with TWA for the three approved routes remains inforce.   Mr. Skinner, he said, &quot;made a factually incorrectstatement. Our contract with TWA remains in effect and bindsTWA to sell these routes to American.&quot; He said the contract&quot;bars TWA from entering into any transaction -- with Mr.Kerkorian or anyone else -- which will adversely impact TWA'sability to make that transfer.&quot;   Mr. Crandall's statement reiterates the airline's positionthat it will challenge anyone who tries to come between itand its routes. Earlier this month, AMR Executive VicePresident Donald Carty threatened to sue a group of politicaland civic leaders in St. Louis, where TWA has its hub, whowere pushing for the sale to Mr. Kerkorian. To avoid any suchlitigation, Tracinda had asked the department to hold offapproving the London route sale to American for 60 days toallow Tracinda to approach TWA.   Mr. Skinner refused the Tracinda request, and thedepartment's order said that Tracinda's &quot;vague&quot; plan had&quot;obvious flaws.&quot; But Mr. Skinner's statements that Tracindawas cleared to talk to TWA did placate members of Congresswho have been pushing the Kerkorian bid. &quot;The department'saction is not everything that we had hoped for,&quot; but &quot;is asignificant victory,&quot; said Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo). Mr.Skinner &quot;has opened the door for {TWA Chairman} Carl Icahn tosell TWA with all its routes intact to TWA's employees andTracinda.&quot;   But others on the Kerkorian side took a dimmer view. &quot;Theprovision that prevents TWA from negotiating is the agreementbetween TWA and American Airlines -- not something before theTransportation Department,&quot; said Susan Jollie, a partner atGalland, Kharasch, Morse andamp; Garfinkle, a Washington law firmthat represents TWA's flight attendant union.   Tracinda said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; that Mr. Skinnerdidn't give them 60 days to talk with TWA, but remains&quot;committed to a possible acquisition of TWA.&quot; It added that&quot;substantial unanswered questions still remain&quot; regarding thestatus of the American-TWA contract.   In any case, Mr. Skinner's comments about the Kerkorianeffort increase the pressure on American to quickly reach anagreement with Mr. Icahn on the sale price for the threeroute transfers approved by the department. Mr. Icahn hasmade it clear that AMR should pay $445 million for just thethree routes. AMR thinks that price is too high.   American is also under pressure to get the deal settledbecause its archrival, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, startedLondon service in April after getting approval to take overPan Am Corp.'s London routes. American had hoped to startservice June 1, but because of delays in the issuance of thedepartment's order, the earliest it could now start serviceis July 1, assuming talks with TWA are successful.   In the decision issued yesterday, the department approvedthe sale of London routes from New York, Boston and LosAngeles, which accounted for 85% of the traffic in theoriginal six-route deal. On the grounds of preservingcompetition, it rejected the sale of routes from St. Louis,Baltimore and Philadelphia. But TWA could sell the routes toother carriers, subject to federal approval.   On what American will pay for the three approved routes,TWA's Mr. Icahn said yesterday, &quot;We now await American'sdecision as to whether they wish to proceed with thetransaction on the terms permitted by&quot; the department ruling.   He appears ready to play hard ball. Mr. Icahn isconsidering having ACF Industries, a railcar company hecontrols, purchase about $140 million that TWA holds in USXCorp. and other securities. Such a move would give thefinancially ailing airline some breathing room and reducepressure to wrap up a sale to American.   Meanwhile, Mr. Skinner has changed positions on theTWA-American deal more than once. The department's tentativeapproval, issued March 14, approved the sale of three routesto American, but ordered TWA to keep the St. Louis route andturn the Philadelphia and Baltimore routes back to thegovernment.   And according to today's edition of Aviation Daily, Mr.Skinner on April 3 wrote to White House Chief of Staff JohnSununu saying that he had decided to approve the sale of allsix routes to American, but that the carrier would berequired to sell three of the routes within six months. Mr.Skinner said Mr. Sununu didn't ask him to change thedecision.</TEXT></DOC>
