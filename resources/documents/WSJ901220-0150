In a long-awaited announcement, the Japanese airline saidWednesday that it will spend as much as $4.1 billion onorders for Seattle-based Boeing Co.'s new 777 model and asmuch as $1.7 billion on orders for the A-340 made by Europe'sAirbus Industrie consortium.</LP><TEXT>   All Nippon's is the second order for the 777, Boeing'sfirst all-new model in more than a decade, since it wasintroduced in October. Industry officials have been closelymonitoring orders for the new plane to determine whether thehigh-stakes Boeing project will succeed in the increasinglycompetitive market. With its military segment losing money inrecent years, Boeing's profitability has been riding on itscommercial aircraft business.   All Nippon's decision to place one-third of its total neworder with Airbus gives the European consortium its firstcontract in Japan for its midsize A-340. A spokesman for theairline said the orders were the first that it had split forone category of plane.   Boeing officials downplayed the split. &quot;Certainly it isn'tunprecedented,&quot; a spokesman for the Boeing CommercialAirplane Group said. &quot;I think it's very difficult tosecond-guess what a customer ultimately is going to do.&quot;   All Nippon said it is committed to buying 15 777s, whichBoeing values at $2.6 billion in delivery-year dollars,including spares and support, and has options to buy 10 more.ANA also placed five firm orders with Airbus and took optionson five more A-340s. The airline spokesman said the companyhas never canceled an option. Industry observers say such amove can increase maintenance costs.   Many analysts and industry officials also believe AllNippon split the orders &quot;for political reasons,&quot; said PeggyFurusaka, an airline analyst with Baring Securities Ltd.'sTokyo office. Competitors have accused Airbus's Europeansponsors of using subsidized rates and the lure of potentialEuropean landing rights to secure orders and develop a viableaircraft industry.   An Airbus official in Tokyo strongly denied that theconsortium used either tactic to get the All Nippon contract.By choosing the A-340, the airline has helped to sow &quot;theseeds of an even deeper and longer-lasting relationshipbetween our two companies,&quot; Airbus managing director JeanPierson said in a statement.   Boeing itself gave All Nippon a few incentives to buy the777, including turning over 20% of the plane's development toJapan's three leading aircraft makers. &quot;Unless Japanesecompanies purchase this,&quot; said Noriko Umino, an analyst forJardine Fleming Securities Ltd., &quot;Japanese bureaucrats whomake it a national policy to develop an aircraft industrylose face.&quot;   In addition, &quot;this reduces Japan's trade surplus&quot; with theU.S., said Jesus Duarte, an analyst with W.I. Carr (Overseas)Ltd. The aircraft field is the last remaining majorindustrial sector in which the U.S. has a trade surplus withJapan.   The clear loser from ANA's decision is St. Louis-basedMcDonnell Douglas Corp., whose midsize MD-11s were also underconsideration. The next major competition in Japan foraircraft orders is expected to be a Japan Air Lines order inthe third quarter of 1991. Officials at the Douglas AircraftCo. unit in Long Beach, Calif., declined comment on the AllNippon order.   Although Boeing controls more than half of the worldcommercial-aircraft market, its new 360-seat wide-body 777fills a longstanding gap in its lineup. The aircraft hasseveral features considered innovative, such as foldingwingtips that allow it to be parked in slots designed forsmaller planes. Boeing received its first order for the 777two months ago, when UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines,said it would buy as many as 68. All Nippon will begin takingdelivery of its planes in 1995.</TEXT></DOC>
