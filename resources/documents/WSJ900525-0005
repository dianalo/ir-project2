The exchange also found that the teletypist, Cosimo LouisPellegrino, a resident of Brooklyn, made materialmisstatements to the Big Board in connection with theincident.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Pellegrino couldn't be reached for comment. SmithBarney declined to comment.   In January 1988, the exchange said, a floor broker, whomthe exchange declined to identify, left the attache case onthe floor of his booth and then left the area. When thebroker returned, the case was missing.   The floor broker asked Mr. Pellegrino about it, and theteletypist told him that an individual who worked on thefloor took the briefcase. Mr. Pellegrino also said he wouldtry to get it back. A couple of days later, Mr. Pellegrinoreturned the attache case to the broker, but $900 of the$12,700 was missing.   It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for floor brokers tohave cash on the exchange floor; some independent brokers usetheir booths on the floor as offices and may have some casharound for operations or personal reasons.   Mr. Pellegrino gave the Big Board the allegedperpetrator's name and address and said he worked on thefloor. The exchange checked its employment records,interviewed floor employees, sent certified letters to theaddress Mr. Pellegrino provided, contacted the owner of thebuilding there, and tried to get a phone number for theindividual, all to no avail.   An exchange hearing panel found that Mr. Pellegrino tookthe case and lied about how he got it.</TEXT></DOC>
