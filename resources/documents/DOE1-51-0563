Handling, treatment,and storage of these wastes are areas that have received considerableattention from the entire nuclear industry. Although no decision concerning&quot;permanent&quot; disposition of these wastes has yet been reached, a new facilitybuilt by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at the ICPP near Idaho Falls,Idaho, is providing the capability to solidify the liquid wastes andsafely store them in underground bins. The recently constructed facilityis the New Waste Calcining Facility (NCWF) which was built at the IdahoChemical Processing Plant to replace a pilot plant demonstration facilitythat began operation in the early 1960's. In summary, the NWCF has beenan unqualified success and the objectives established for the new facilityhave been met and and in most cases exceeded. We believe that for theICPP, the unique blend of remote/direct maintenance being implementedis a good solution to existing problems.</TEXT></DOC>
