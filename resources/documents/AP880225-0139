(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist SeymourHersh is coming ``because you don't normally get this interestingmix of people.'' Former CIA director William Colby will attend``because I think someone needs to say a few good words about theagency.''   Hersh and Colby are among more than 30 experts and commentatorswho plan to meet Friday at Tufts University for a two-day forum onthe role of covert aid and secrecy in U.S. foreign policy.   The panelists include former and current members of theintelligence community, military and defense officials,journalists, educators and legal specialists. They representopinions ``from the left, right and center of the ideologicalspectrum,'' forum coordinator Sherman Teichman said Thursday.   Teichman said the conference, sponsored jointly by Tufts, theNational Security Archive, the U.S. Department of Defense and theCenter for the Study of Covert Action, will address more than suchobvious examples of covert action as the Iran-Contra affair.   ``It is important to ask if the use of covert actions is anecessary part of dealing with foreign governments,'' he said. ``Ifit is a necessary evil and used to influence others to our way ofthinking, then how does a democracy justify its actions?''   Topics at the forum include ``The Southeast Asian Experience: ACase Study''; ``Lessons of Vietnam and Southeast Asia for the1980s''; ``The Iran-Contra Affair: The Hostage Ransom, Iran-IsraelArms Sale''; and ``Contra Support: Managing and Supplying aParamilitary Operation.''   Also scheduled to attend are Bob Woodward of the WashingtonPost; ``Pentagon Papers'' leaker Daniel Ellsberg; Thomas Polgar, aformer CIA station chief in Saigon; former Sen. Thomas F. Eagletonof Missouri; and Scott Armstrong, executive director of theNational Security Archive.   ``It seems like a rather contentious group of people,'' saidColby, now an attorney in Washington, D.C. Colby said he willdefend his opinion that ``covert action is a regular part ofAmerican foreign policy. It's perfectly compatible with Americandemocracy.''   Eagleton has prepared a paper reviewing the history ofcongressional oversight of covert activities. He said the symposiumis particularly timely because of a pending Senate bill that wouldplug loopholes in existing laws that allowed the Reaganadministration not to notify Congress at the time of the Iran armsdeal.   ``There can be a time and circumstances where covert action isclearly in the American interest,'' said Eagleton. ``But thequestion is: Under what conditions of shared knowledge does ourgovernment undertake covert action?''   Hersh, with tongue slightly in cheek, said he has split views onthe need for covert operations.   ``I have mixed feelings about it because on one hand, peoplelike me get to write books on it and make a lot of money,'' hesaid. ``On the other hand, I don't see, especially when you'retalking about things like Chile, what (secret actions) have donefor the American people.''</TEXT></DOC>
