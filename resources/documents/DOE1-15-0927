Investigations were supported in various aspectsof neutral atmospheric density, ionospheric scintillation, magnetic fieldmodels, magnetospherically trapped particles and auroral-particle precipitation.Software systems have been developed for processing and analyzing datapertaining to these research areas, and for interactive targeting ofthe space shuttle, ephemeris computation during double thrust, and processingof celestial aspect sensor data.</TEXT></DOC>
