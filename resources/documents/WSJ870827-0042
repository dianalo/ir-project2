That would put the value of the transaction at $36.9 million to $38 million.    Home Group shares closed at $20.625, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    At July 31, the company had 36.6 million shares outstanding on a pro forma basis. Home Group said the transaction was part of a continuing stock buy-back program. </TEXT></DOC>
