Gordon Crovitz and this newspaper's editorial page havewaged a long war on independent counsels in general andLawrence Walsh in particular. In his Feb. 13 Rule of Lawcolumn, &quot;Walsh's Jeffrey Toobin: A Witness of theProsecution,&quot; Mr. Crovitz attempts to enlist me and my book,&quot;Opening Arguments: A Young Lawyer's First Case -- UnitedStates v. Oliver North,&quot; as his newest recruits. Hell no, tocoin a phrase, we won't go.   The chief flaw in Mr. Crovitz's analysis is that heinterprets difficulties imposed on Judge Walsh's Office ofIndependent Counsel as misdeeds perpetrated by the OIC. Mr.Crovitz blasts the OIC for supposedly violating the rules onclassified information. The fact is that the OIC did not askthe permission of the nation's intelligence agencies aboutwhere to pursue its investigation, because current and formeremployees of those very agencies were subjects of ourinvestigation. How could we have let them -- the subjects --dictate the scope of our mission? To do so would have been,as I wrote in &quot;Opening Arguments,&quot; a &quot;shocking abdication ofour independence.&quot; The OIC did later have to dismiss some ofthe charges against Oliver North because the intelligenceagencies refused to declassify enough so-called secrets toensure fair, public trials. What Mr. Crovitz ignores is thatit was the agencies, bent on protecting turf and preservingfictional secrets, that bear the blame for the dismissals --not Judge Walsh.</LP><TEXT>   It's a similar story about immunity. Mr. Crovitz claimsthat the OIC &quot; use{d}testimony and evidence that Congress hadgranted immunity&quot;. Wrong. I noted that the OIC went toparalyzing extremes to avoid using Oliver North's immunizedtestimony before Congress -- and we succeeded to the extenthumanly possible. Mr. North snookered the congressionalIran-Contra committees into giving him a hasty grant ofimmunity-and then made monkeys of them in his televisedtestimony. Judge Gerhard Gesell was convinced that the OICmade no use of that testimony in the North trial, a findingreversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. My book is clear on myview: Those of us at the OIC who investigated and triedOliver North did so without knowledge of or reference to thisimmunized testimony. And the fault for those reversals restswith those bamboozled congressional investigators -- again,not with Judge Walsh.   In general, Mr. Crovitz cites my book as proof of histhesis that the Walsh investigation represented, in essence,a liberal prosecutorial hit squad -- one that &quot;imploded intoa Keystone Kops prosecution.&quot; In fact, I regarded mycolleagues at the OIC as an extraordinarily skilledcollection of lawyers who, against difficult odds, conducteda thorough and decent investigation. While we differed amongourselves on such issues as whether violation of the BolandAmendment was a crime, we addressed these questions based onour goodfaith judgments as prosecutors -- not anyone'spolitical agenda. Even the editorial board of The Wall StreetJournal must occasionally enjoy a spirited debate -- over,say, whether Robert Bork more resembles Mother Teresa or Joanof Arc. Such open exchanges of views are, I think, signs ofstrength, not weakness.   I can't quarrel with one thing Mr. Crovitz has to say.Judge Walsh's threats to have me imprisoned for writing&quot;Opening Arguments&quot; were, to understate the case, anill-considered use of his authority and the governmentresources at his command. Bad enough on its own, JudgeWalsh's foray into censorship also leaves an additionalunfortunate residue: leading fairminded observers to conclude-- incorrectly, if understandably -- that Mr. Crovitz wasright all along.
