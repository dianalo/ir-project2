Both banking companies will reconvene special stockholder meetings July 26 pertaining to the merger accord, which calls for 1.1 shares of Eagle common to be distributed for each BFS share held.    On June 28, the meetings were adjourned after the Connecticut banking commissioner said the merger was subject to certain provisions of his state's Bank Holding Company and Bank Acquisition Act. Enough votes at those meetings were received to approve the merger. The commissioner, Howard B. Brown, later ruled the merger excepted from the Connecticut statute because it overlaps federal statutes on &quot;fairness to shareholders.&quot;    The total transaction value of BFS's 1.2 million shares would be about $11.4 million, based on yesterday's closing price of Eagle common at $9, up 12.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
