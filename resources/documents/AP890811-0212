But the dollar still managed to hold on to gains against majorforeign currencies.   Central banks decided to intervene after the dollar failed toweaken, as expected, in reaction to what should have been negativefigures for the dollar, said a market source, who requestedanonymity.   The dollar fell briefly after the release in Washington ofunexpected news on the U.S. Producer Price Index for July, butalmost immediately rebounded on renewed buying interest.   The news that the inflation index fell 0.4 percent normallywould have been bearish for the dollar because it implies an easingof interest rates may be at hand. The market had expected producerprices to be up 0.1 percent.   A separate report on U.S. retail sales helped alleviate somerecession fears. Retail sales, paced by renewed spending onautomobiles, rebounded 0.9 percent in July after posting theirfirst back-to-back monthly declines since early 1986.   A string of European central banks including West Germany'sBundesbank, the Bank of England and banks of Belgium, Italy andSwitzerland, were among those selling dollars. The U.S. FederalReserve also sold dollars, currency dealers reported.   Several central banks, such as the Bundesbank, confirmed theiractions that were first reported by currency dealers. The Fed'spolicy is not to comment on market reports of intervention.   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost$1.5940 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5988 at midmorning and$1.6280 late Thursday.   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business daybegins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 140.10 yen. Later, inLondon, it was quoted at a higher rate of 141.50 yen vs. 141.05 yenbefore the intervention.
