It was not more specific.   Missiles fired by the U.S. missile cruiser Vincennes destroyedthe airliner Sunday over the Persian Gulf.   The typewritten statement in Arabic was delivered to a Westernnews agency in Beirut with a photocopy of a page from hostageEdward Austin Tracy's U.S. passport.   Revolutionary Justice says it is holding Tracy and anotherAmerican, Joseph James Cicippio.   ``We have monitored all the positions denouncing or supportingthe American crime,'' the statement said. ``We consider whoever hasdenounced it a friend to the peoples of the area and whoever hassupported it a partner.''   In threats directed at President Reagan, it said: ``We willfight you. We will torture you with our hands. You will not knowwhere, when and how torture and death will face you.''   On Oct. 21, 1986, the group calling itself the RevolutionaryJustice Organization claimed responsibility for kidnapping Tracy,57, a writer from Rutland, Vt.   Cicippio, 58, acting comptroller at the American University ofBeirut, was abducted Sept. 12, 1986. He is from Valley Forge, Pa.   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are captives inLebanon, and most believed in the hands of Shiite extremists loyalto Iran. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.   The photocopy, apparently intended to authenticate Thursday'sstatement, showed the passport page bearing Tracy's photograph,name and date of birth.   It said the shooting down of the Iran Air jetliner ``was not thefirst time America killed children, women and other innocentcivilians and will not be the last one.''   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization stresses that thepresence of these (U.S.) fleets and their crimes will certainlyreflect on the safety of the American presence all over theworld.'' the statement said.   Revolutionary Justice, Islamic Jihad and other Shiite groupsholding hostages are believed to be affiliated with theIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.   A telephone caller who said he spoke for Islamic Jihadthreatened on Tuesday to kill one of the two American captives itholds and dump the body in a west Beirut neighborhood. Police saidlater the call was a hoax.   Islamic Jihad holds Anderson, 40, and educator ThomasSutherland, 57, acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut. He was abducted June 9, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
