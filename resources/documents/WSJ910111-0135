Hedeclined to name the &quot;several prospective buyers.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The spokesman wouldn't divulge the prices being discussed,or Soho's current sales levels. One reason Seagram may belooking for a buyer, however, is that its business is gearedtoward high volumes at retail, while Soho is mainly asingle-bottle purchase.   At the time of the earlier sale, Soho's founder saidSeagram sought to increase sales by four or five times from1988 levels of $25 million, within only two years. Thatgrowth apparently didn't materialize.   Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with PaineWebber in SanFrancisco, said Seagram's purchase of Soho &quot;didn't appear tomake a great deal of sense when it was done. . . .&quot;   Mr. Goldman said distribution is a key factor thatdifferentiates soft drinks from other consumer products; theyare typically delivered directly to stores by bottlers.&quot;Those that go through brokers have a built-in disadvantage,&quot;he said.   But Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles,beverage industry consulting firm, said he thought sellingSoho meant Seagram would try to use the Tropicana name tobuild its soft-drink business: &quot;They've decided to go intothe soft-drink business on the basis of a brand that has ahuge following, rather than make a pygmy into a giant.&quot;   Seagram's purchase of the Soho unit was seen as a bid todiversify out of its core hard liquor brands, includingChivas Regal, VO and Crown Royal. The so-called New Agebeverage category, which includes all-natural sodas likeSoho, as well as sweetened seltzers and carbonated juices,was viewed as a high-growth area that didn't directly competewith soft-drink giants Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc.   Soho was founded in 1977 as a shoestring operation by then-- 21-year-old Sophia Collier and partner Connie Best. Thepartners peddled the first bottles from the back of Ms.Collier's jeep.</TEXT></DOC>
