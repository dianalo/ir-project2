Under these conditions, information can be extracted froma sufficiently great substrate-layer depth, whose mass thickness is smallerby a factor of {similar_to}4 than the mass thickness of the film coatingthe heterostructure. For the same exciting-electron energy, the depthresolution in a specimen under films is substantially higher than ina specimen without film.</TEXT></DOC>
