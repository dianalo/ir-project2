The move may touch off a series of similar antitrust charges against waste haulers in other parts of the country, according to attorneys familiar with the Justice Department's nationwide investigation of the waste-disposal industry. The action also indicates that Waste Management, the subject of federal antitrust investigations in six states, may be cooperating with antitrust prosecutors.    The charge against the Oak Brook, Ill.-based waste hauler came in a one-count felony information, a procedure used when a defendant waives the right to a grand jury indictment. The information, filed yesterday in federal court in Miami, charges that Waste Management Inc. of Florida, doing business as United Sanitation Services, conspired with unnamed competitors to allocate customers in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas.    In a statement from its corporate headquarters, Waste Management said it hadn't seen the federal information. The company said it believed the charge related to an earlier federal antitrust investigation that resulted in the convictions last year of two top Waste Management officials in Florida. In a memorandum filed in that case, government prosecutors called the former head of United Sanitation Services, Lewis R. Goodman, the &quot;chief architect&quot; of the antitrust conspiracy. Mr. Goodman, who was one of those convicted, has appealed. Waste Management wasn't named in the earlier case.    Waste Management said the latest charge &quot;is now finally being brought against a single division of the company in Miami which employed&quot; the two employees. The company said it has cooperated with the government throughout the latest investigation.    A spokesman for Waste Management said the company hadn't made a plea agreement with the government.    A Justice Department spokesman said the antitrust charge carries a maximum fine of $1 million.    In its charge, the department said Waste Management and unnamed co-conspirators acted in concert to divide up customers in Dade and Broward counties in Florida. By refraining from taking each other's business, the waste haulers were able to submit &quot;intentionally high bids&quot; to customers in the south Florida area. The prosecutors said the alleged conspiracy lasted from 1980 to November 1985 and involved revenue in excess of $45 million during 1984 alone.    The government also accused the alleged conspirators of &quot;compensating each other for customers acquired in violation of the continuing agreement.&quot;    The government's charge is similar to antitrust charges filed against Waste Management subsidiaries in the past year by Ohio and Florida and by Los Angeles County. None of those cases have come to trial, and the waste hauler has denied any wrongdoing. Eleven federal grand juries from Florida to California are looking into allegations of price fixing and bid rigging by waste haulers. Waste Management is a subject of seven of those investigations, according to people familiar with the investigations. Waste Management has disputed its role in several of those investigations.    In a separate investigation, federal prosecutors in Chicago are looking into allegations by former Waste Management officials and others that Waste Management officials took part in bribes to local politicians for business and favors. Waste Management has said it wasn't involved in any illegal activities.    The Justice Department's decision to file an information at the end of a criminal investigation, rather than to seek an indictment, typically means that the target of the inquiry has agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with future government investigative efforts.    In the past, Justice Department antitrust officials have stressed that they don't file a criminal information unless there is a strong expectation that a defendant is willing and able to provide information relevant to a continuing inquiry. Agency spokesmen wouldn't say whether a plea agreement has been reached in their latest Florida case.    A plea agreement between Waste Management and the government, if one is negotiated, could provide prosecutors with additional evidence to use in cases involving Waste Management competitors in Florida and elsewhere, according to people familiar with the investigations. The Justice Department has used plea agreements for such purposes in all of its recent nationwide criminal antitrust investigations. </TEXT></DOC>
