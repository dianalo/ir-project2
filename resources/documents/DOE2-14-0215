Very little has been published, however, addressingthe risks associated with acquisition and operation of producing properties.Because capital budgets usually depend on the income a company realizesfrom its producing properties, and because current conditions have beeninterpreted by many to favor the acquisition of existing oil reservesover exploring for new ones, the risk in estimating reserves and in estimatingfuture cash flows for producing properties has taken on a new importance.The risks associated with estimating the reserves and value of a hydrocarbon-producingproperty are divided into three classifications: (1) the technical riskthat the hydrocarbon values estimated by the geologists and engineersdo exist in the ground and that the recoverable amounts can be recoveredwithin the time frame projected by the engineers; (2) the economic riskthat product prices, operating costs, equipment costs, inflation, andmarket conditions will be in reasonable agreement with the assumptionsused in the economic analysis; and (3) the political risk that worldeconomics, international political stability, taxation, and regulationswill not be significantly different than projected in the evaluation.This paper focus on these risk categories and presents methods for implementingrisk estimates in the evaluation of a producing property, taking intoaccount the maturity of the technical data, the location, and the lifeof the property. A Glossary of important terms is included.</TEXT></DOC>
