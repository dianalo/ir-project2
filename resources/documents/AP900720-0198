Company spokesman Tom Rhoades said Thursday that one of the bidsinvolves a subsidiary of archrival General Motors Corp. He declinedto say how much money was offered in any of the proposals.   ``We would narrow it down to a single bidder sometime nextweek,'' he said. ``It could be earlier.''   Ford Aerospace, which has contracts with the Defense Departmentand the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was put upfor sale Jan. 12.   Chrysler Corp. and Ford put their prime defense contractingsubsidiaries on the block as speculation grew that the governmentwould drastically cut back its purchasing because of reducedtensions with the Soviet Union.   The automakers said they wanted to focus on their corebusinesses of making, financing and selling cars and trucks.Chrysler sold its Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. subsidiary in Februaryfor $825 million.   GM has said it does not plan to sell its main defensesubsidiary, GM-Hughes Electronic Corp., which includes HughesAircraft Co. and Delco Electronics Corp.   Rhoades said one of the three bids came as a joint effortbetween GM-Hughes and Alcatel Co. of France.   The others are from Loral Corp., a New York defense electronicscompany, and a consortium of Westinghouse Electric Corp., theinvestment firm Carlyle Group, and Aerospatiale of France, which isconnected with the Airbus aircraft.   Loral spokeswoman Elizabeth Allen confirmed the company hadsubmitted a bid, but declined to disclose details or say when sheexpected a decision from Ford.   Ford Aerospace's operations and products include the Sidewinderair-to-air missile, space vehicles including the INTELSATcommunications satellite and computer programs.
