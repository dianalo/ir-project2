(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In search of  linguistic perfectionandM;Spelling checkers and thesauri only add a relatively small amount to yoursoftware's costs, but they add a lot of power to your word processing.andM;By Dennis KlatzkinandM;One of the most identifiable recent trends in Macintosh software is theinclusion of spelling checkers and thesauri, either bundled with orincorporated into programs.andP;  Once, if you wanted such utilities, your onlyoption was to purchase them separately.andM;Today, most word processing, desktop publishing and even some graphicsapplications offer these options (although there are a few importantexceptions, like Aldus Corp.'s PageMaker).andP;  Still, the add-on linguistic aidshave a viable place in the Mac market, offering features and capabilitiessimply not available in their built-in or bundled counterparts.andM;We looked at three application-independent spelling checkers and threethesauri that are marketed separately to determine how good a case can stillbe made for buying them in addition to the ones you may already own as partof programs you've acquired.andP;  Among spelling checkers, we reviewed Spellswell2.2 from Working Software Inc. of Santa Cruz, Calif.; Thunder II 1.0.1 fromElectronic Arts of San Mateo, Calif.; and Coach Professional 3.0 from DenebaSoftware of Miami.andP;  Among thesauri, we examined Deneba's BigThesaurus;Language Master 2.1 from Franklin Software of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and WordFinder 2.0 from Micro-lytics Inc. of Pittsford, N.Y.andM;Spelling checkers.andP;  People use spelling checkers for a number of reasons:because they need help with their spelling or their typing or they simplywant their documents to be perfect.andP;  So different spell-checking modes andfeatures will appeal to different types of users.andP;  Spelling checkers can workinteractively, warning you as soon as you've made an error.andP;  Or they canoperate in batch mode, where you check an entire passage or document.andM;Spellswell is an application that only offers batch checking of entiredocuments.andP;  If you're running MultiFinder, you must save and close the fileto be checked; under the Finder, you have to save your file and quit from theword processing application.andP;  And, if you also want an interactive checkingmode, you must purchase yet another of the company's products, Lookup.andM;Spellswell 2.2 can check documents created by all versions of Microsoft Word,Works and Write; MacWrite 5.0 and MacWrite II; WordPerfect; Acta; MindWrite;WriteNow; QuickLetter; Apple-Link; MORE but not MORE II; and text-onlydocuments.andP;  It cannot check Word documents that have been &quot;fast-saved.&quot;andM;Thunder II is a Control Panel document you can configure to automaticallyopen from within any number of applications and desk accessories you specify.andO;You must have a document open to check it with Thunder.andP;  When active, theutility can check your spelling interactively as you type or as a batchoperation upon any selected text.andP;  In batch mode, the program stops andawaits your decision on all occurrences of words it doesn't recognize.andM;Thunder II 1.0.1 works within a wide range of Macintosh programs, includingmost popular word processors, text editors, outliners and other applications.andO;It is the only product we tested that can check the spelling of PageMakerfiles.andP;  Notably absent from Thunder II's list of compatible programs isQuarkXPress, Ready,Set,Go! and Microsoft Works 2.0.andM;Deneba's Coach Professional is a hybrid product, a DA that incorporates aspelling checker, thesaurus and definition dictionary.andP;  When you activateCoach within an application you can check your spelling as you type or inbatch mode.andM;Coach Professional offers a unique twist on batch checking: You have theoption of configuring the program to compile and display a concise list ofthe words it doesn't recognize.andP;  After you eliminate from the list any wordsyou know to be correctly spelled, such as names and other proper nouns, youcan correct the remaining words individually, thereby speeding up theprocess.andM;Although Coach Professional 3.0 will check spelling within many applications,its ability to substitute corrections while maintaining proper textformatting is limited to Microsoft Word 3.01, Write, Works 1.0, MacWrite,WriteNow 1.0, MindWrite, MORE (not MORE II) and ThinkTank.andP;  We found thatCoach operates moderately well in Word 4.0 but with intermittent glitches andinterruptions.andP;  Coach Professional 3.1, due to be released by year end, willbe fully functional within many more applications.andM;Performance.andP;  Spelling checkers present any number of evaluation criteria --user interface design, speed, lexicon size and quality -- not to mentiontheir ability to cope with the endless number of oddities in Englishorthography, punctuation and word structure.andM;We found the batch-checking modes of the three programs tested (as well asthe interactive modes in Coach and Thunder) to be quite fast and comparablein speed, with Thunder having the performance edge.andP;  However, the programs'user interfaces seem to play a more significant role in determining theireffective speeds than the velocity with which they scan their dictionarydatabases.andM;In that regard, we found that Spellswell was the least effective program ofthe three because you must exit a document to check it.andP;  We particularlyliked Coach's quick compilation and display of unrecognized words; people whoare good spellers but prone to make typos will find this feature speeds theirspelling checks dramatically.andP;  But Coach's configuration dialog boxes are ascryptic as any we've seen, and the program is not nearly intuitive enough.andO;Spellswell and Thunder offer more-intuitive interfaces.andP;  All three utilitiesmake excellent use of keyboard shortcuts.andM;The spelling checkers all present you with replacement suggestions --attempts by the programs to guess the correct word you may want to substitutefor an unrecognized one.andP;  All three programs combined some very good guesseswith others that were totally out in left field.andP;  For making correctsuggestions based on phonetics, Spellswell seemed the most effective, whileCoach was capable but tediously slow and Thunder II offered the leastphonetic ability.andM;Spellswell has a 93,000-word dictionary, plus a smaller one with 60,000 wordsif disk space is at a premium.andP;  Working Software markets supplemental medicaland legal lexicons at $99.95 each and geographical and scientific lexicons at$59.95 each.andM;Thunder's large dictionary contains 86,000 words, and there's a smaller onewith 50,000 words, as well as three very brief, supplemental dictionaries forabbreviations, contractions and computer terms.andP;  Coach comes with a large,95,000-word dictionary; a smaller, more densely compressed one with 80,000words; a 35,000-word medical lexicon; and a 28,000-word legal lexicon.andP;  Theupcoming Coach 3.1 also will include a technical dictionary.andM;Not surprisingly, we found Coach's dictionary to be the most complete, and itflagged the fewest unrecognized but otherwise correctly spelled words.andP;  Noneof the three products sanction even the most-common Mac-related terms, butall of them let you add words to user dictionaries.andP;  Coach and Thunder willlet you paste long lists of new words from the Clipboard into itsdictionaries if you want to make such additions en masse; the process ofmerging large groups of new words into Spellswell is slow and arduous.andM;Other features.andP;  The spelling checkers we tested presented us with a varietyof benefits and trade-offs.andP;  Spellswell offers the most-comprehensivechecking beyond simple spelling: It checks for many double-word, punctuation,hyphenation and capitalization errors, and includes a unique Word Choiceshomonym-checking feature.andP;  But Spellswell handles typographer's (or &quot;curly&quot;)quotes and apostrophes in only the crudest manner.andM;Thunder II offers a respectable level of checking for structural andpunctuation errors, plus a glossary feature that allows you to defineabbreviations and expand them later with a search-and-replace operation.andM;Coach's integrated thesaurus and 85,000-word definition dictionary arevaluable additions to its spelling checker.andP;  We found its Merriam-Websterthesaurus database to be somewhat archaic in the synonyms it suggests, butthe soon-to-be-released Coach 3.1 will instead integrate Deneba's larger andmore modern BigThesaurus into the program.andM;All three spelling checkers work well with MultiFinder.andP;  Although some of thevendors may claim their programs will function on floppy-based systems, ahard disk is really the minimum practical hardware configuration for any ofthem.andP;  And, depending on the number of features in the program, they canoccupy considerable amounts of hard disk space (see chart, Page 47).andM;Thesauri.andP;  We evaluated three thesaurus desk accessories: BigThesaurus,Language Master and Word Finder.andP;  They were simpler in design and operationthan the spelling checkers.andP;  They don't rely on as high a degree of userintervention, and their synonym databases are static and immutable.andM;All three products let you view groupings of synonyms for a highlighted wordand allow you to automatically substitute any one of the words in thethesaurus window for the original word by simply clicking on a button.andM;BigThesaurus was indeed the biggest, most comprehensive and detailed of theseutilities.andP;  Its more than 100,000 root words and more than 1.4 millionsynonyms, antonyms, related, compared and contrasted words are augmented byconcise definitions for each group of related word meanings.andP;  It is also theonly thesaurus among the three to use multiple, resizable, non-modal windowsand to employ color as a visual aid to convey information.andM;Language Master is unique in that it contains an integrated 80,000-worddefinition dictionary with its thesaurus of 40,000 root words and 470,000true synonyms.andP;  With only 220,000 true synonyms, Word Finder 2.0 is thesimplest and most terse of the three programs.andP;  But it requires much lessdisk space than the other thesauri, an important consideration for someusers.andM;With thesauri, matters of speed, interface design and program compatibilityare less the issue than the actual content of the lexicons.andP;  Language Masteruses the same archaic synonym database we found fault with in CoachProfessional 3.0 -- it's passable, but the least useful of the three.andM;Word Finder's lexicon is modern but very basic and concise.andP;  If you'researching for anything but the most-common synonyms, Word Finder won't helpyou often enough.andP;  BigThesaurus is the only utility in the group thatapproaches the thoroughness and efficacy of a printed, unabridged thesaurus.andM;Conclusions.andP;  All six of these utilities are stable, well-designed productsthat will easily justify the relatively small costs they add to your libraryof software.andP;  Their manuals are generally adequate, with Thunder's being thebest of the lot.andP;  The vendors all provide good, unlimited technical support;Deneba and Franklin Software offer toll-free service.andM;These programs offer worthwhile benefits beyond the spelling checkers andthesauri built into or bundled with the new crop of Mac programs.andO;(Spellswell and Word Finder are actually integrated into or included withseveral popular packages.)andM;Our first choice among the thesauri is clear-cut: We have no doubt thatBig-Thesaurus is the best and most useful of the three.andP;  But, if disk spaceis a major concern, Word Finder is a serviceable alternative.andM;Among the spelling checkers, we preferred the full-featured CoachProfessional.andP;  But we concede it's not for everyone -- for the time being,its compatibility range is limited.andP;  If you don't need its integratedthesaurus or definition dictionary (or can't afford the large amount of harddisk storage they demand), we believe Thunder II is an outstandingalternative.andM;If you want to proof more than just spelling, Spellswell is the mostversatile utility of the three.andP;  Clearly, with spelling checkers, yourindividual work styles and needs should be the critical factors in yourdecision.andM;Spelling checkers offer a variety of modes and features, so it's important todetermine which product is the right one for you.andP;  All three products wetested can do batch checking; Deneba Software's Coach Professional 3.0 andElectronic Arts' Thunder II 1.0.1 can also check your spelling interactivelyas you type.andM;We found Coach to be the most full-featured and effective spelling checkerand, with all its bundled extras, it was also the best value -- but at theexpense of rather steep demands on disk storage space and limited programcompatibility.andP;  Thunder II is the only utility that can proof PageMaker filesand is an excellent disk-conserving spelling-checker alternative.andP;  WorkingSoftware Inc.'s Spellswell is the most versatile of the three at checkingword structure and punctuation errors.andM;Our conclusions about thesauri are less qualified: Deneba's BigThesaurus isclearly the most useful of the three we tested, and the closest one yet to aprinted thesaurus.andM;Actually, the best combination of all of these utilities may be just aroundthe corner.andP;  Deneba is due to release Coach Professional 3.1 very shortly,and the new product promises to integrate BigThesaurus with Coach's versatilespelling checker and rich definition dictionary.andP;  It also will offer animproved user interface and compatibility range, according to the company.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
