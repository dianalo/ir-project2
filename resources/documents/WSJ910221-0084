In testimony to Congress, the Fed chief said signs are&quot;very gradually emerging&quot; that the recession will bottom out&quot;in the near future.&quot; Although he declined to commentdirectly on the Fed's interest-rate plans, his testimonyseemed to suggest that no further easing moves are in theworks.</LP><TEXT>   But in carefully hedged comments, Mr. Greenspan also saidit &quot;would be most unwise to rule out the possibility that therecession may become more serious than already is apparent.&quot;If that happens, he said, the Fed is prepared to move &quot;asexpeditiously as is necessary&quot; to ease credit further.   Later in the day, Bank of America announced plans to cutits prime lending rate to 8.75% from 9%, apparently aresponse to prior Fed easing moves.   Mr. Greenspan also said the Fed continues to seek ways toencourage banks to lend money without reducing interestrates. Referring to the so-called credit crunch, he said:&quot;The fact of the matter is it is still there, and stillrequires continuing and unrelenting efforts until we get itresolved.&quot;   One way the Fed is addressing the credit crunch is byencouraging banks to borrow more money directly from thecentral bank. In the past, banks have tended to avoidborrowing from the Fed's discount window, fearing theiractions might be taken as a sign of fundamental weakness.   But Mr. Greenspan yesterday for the first time extended anopen invitation to banks to borrow more freely from the Fed.In his written testimony, Mr. Greenspan said: &quot;The FederalReserve has no desire to circumscribe the legitimate use ofthe discount window, and market participants should notinterpret such use as indicating underlying problems for theinstitutions involved.&quot;   He added that the Fed &quot;would not be surprised to seesomewhat higher adjustment borrowing&quot; from the discountwindow in the coming months. Mr. Greenspan didn't make thesecomments in his abbreviated oral testimony, but the writtentestimony was submitted for the official record.   The invitation isn't expected to have much impact on thecredit crunch, however. &quot;There are plenty of funds availablefor banks,&quot; said James McDermott, president of Keefe,Bruyette andamp; Woods, a securities firm that specializes in bankstocks. &quot;What's needed is the willingness of banks to lendand the availability of good quality loans.&quot;   Still, if banks accept the invitation, it could provide amodest boost to their profits. The current discount rate onFed loans to financial institutions is fixed at 6%. That'sbelow the average rate of about 6 1/4% that banks have beenpaying recently for &quot;federal funds,&quot; money they borrow fromone another. Moreover, the federal funds rate has been highlyvolatile in recent weeks, frequently rising above 6 1/4%.   In addition, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed is working withother banking agencies on measures to ensure that tight bankregulation and supervision isn't unnecessarily constrictingcredit. Those measures, being prepared under the supervisionof the Treasury Department, are due in the next week or two.   Mr. Greenspan confirmed earlier reports that the bankingagencies are studying steps to ensure that bank supervisorsevaluate real-estate projects based &quot;not solely onliquidation prices, but upon the ability of a property togenerate cash flow.&quot; In addition, the agencies are seeking toencourage banks to provide more public information on theirbad loans.   But the Fed chairman ruled out the possibility of dealingwith the credit crunch by making further cuts in the reservesbanks are required to hold at the central bank. He said theFed's lowering of reserve requirements last year left manybanks with barely enough reserves to meet their daily needsfor clearing checks and performing other essential functions.As a result, he said, there is a need for &quot;caution inconsidering further reductions in required reserve ratios, atleast for a while.&quot;   Mr. Greenspan's comments were made before the SenateBanking Committee as part of his semiannual report toCongress on monetary policy. In that report, the Fed's OpenMarket Committee reconfirmed the target ranges formoney-supply growth in 1991 that were set last July. Thetarget growth range for M2, which includes most checking andsavings accounts, is 2.5% to 6.5%. The target range for M3,which includes M2 plus certain large time deposits, is 1% to5%. And the target range for overall debt growth is 4.5% to8.5%.   Mr. Greenspan said the Fed has been very concerned becausemoney growth has fallen below its target ranges in recentmonths. But he also noted early signs that the Fed's recenteasing moves are causing money growth to accelerate.   The report to Congress shows Fed governors and districtFed presidents are predicting economic growth for this yearin a range of -0.5% to 1.5%, with the &quot;central tendency&quot; ofthe predictions at 0.75% to 1.5%. Predictions for increasesin consumer prices range from 3% to 4.5%, with a centraltendency of 3.25% to 4%. And predictions for the unemploymentrate range from 6.25% to 7.5% of the work force, with acentral tendency of 6.5% to 7%.   The committee's report said Fed board members and districtbank presidents believe that, &quot;in the near term, the risks tothe economy may be skewed to the downside.&quot;   On other matters, Mr. Greenspan said:   -- He opposes a banking industry plan to use $2 billion ofbank reserves at the Fed to help shore up the government'sbank insurance fund. But he indicated he might favor a planunder which the Fed paid interest on bank reserves and thatmoney was used to shore up the insurance fund.   -- The stalemate of trade talks under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade &quot;is a major problem&quot; for theU.S. and the world economy. &quot;We in the U.S. and our tradingpartners around the world will pay a significant price&quot; if aGATT agreement isn't worked out.   -- He &quot;hopes&quot; to go ahead with President Bush's plan tohead a study of technical issues surrounding a capital-gainstax cut. But he said he's waiting to hear the views not onlyof the president but of &quot;the bipartisan leaders of Congress&quot;on the effort. He said he favors cutting or abolishing thecapital-gains tax, but indicated he has no position on the&quot;technical&quot; issue of whether such a change increases taxrevenues, as Mr. Bush has said.   -- He is optimistic about the outlook for inflation, andsaid reduced cost pressures have given the Fed more room toease credit, if that's needed.</TEXT></DOC>
