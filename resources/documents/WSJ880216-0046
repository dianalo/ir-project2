Thanks to declining mortgage rates and a manufacturing sector that keeps chugging along, some housing analysts are remodeling expectations broken by the October stock-market crash.    But it's too soon to be effusive over January housing starts and building permits, due out tomorrow. Economic and industry analysts say housing starts were probably 4% or 5% lower than December's rate, which fell 16% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 1.4 million units.    &quot;We're expecting a first-quarter trough for single-family housing,&quot; says Mark Lasky, an economist at Data Resources Inc. Mortgage rates have been sliding, but new-home inventory has been pretty high, &quot;so we don't expect things to start improving until the second quarter,&quot; he says.    Many analysts expect housing starts for the full year of about 1.4 million to 1.5 million -- lower than 1987's 1.6 million. Single-family starts are likely to push a bit past one million, if there isn't a debilitating whipsaw in rates. But multifamily starts, which have been seriously damped by recent tax-law changes, are expected to be considerably lower than last year.    &quot;Multifamily is pretty tough,&quot; says Dennis Jacobe, director of research for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.    More optimism on single-family starts recently moved Mr. Jacobe to lift some of the crepe laid over his outlook by the stock-market crash.    The normally sanguine trade group &quot;was even more pessimistic&quot; than most analysts immediately following the crash &quot;because of what we heard on new loan commitments not being made,&quot; he says.    Lately, the league's grapevine reports &quot;people are actually coming in to originate loans,&quot; he says. Just after the crash, Mr. Jacobe was forecasting &quot;down in the 1.5 million-start range or lower,&quot; but recently he revised his estimate to a rosier 1.6 million starts for 1988.    None of this has yet worked its magic in the market, where housing stocks are languishing. &quot;The home builders crashed before the crash,&quot; says Kurt A. Feuerman, an industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The jump in interest rates last spring doused enthusiasm for housing issues, and the crash only worsened matters. Stocks such as Kaufman andamp; Broad Home Corp. and Toll Brothers Inc. have rebounded from their lows, but not stellarly.    Mr. Feuerman and others note that housing has already enjoyed a good five-year cycle that satisfied a lot of pent-up demand. He looks favorably on the housing stocks for their long-term values, but notes their short-term fate is tied to interest rates and the bond market.    While housing is a good tell-tale of the economy, it is by no means the controlling force. The glacial trade deficit and the fluid movements of the Federal Reserve Board's credit policy are omnipresent on the minds of analysts.    And one major economist last week crossed over to the camp predicting a recession. Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said he expects a recession to begin within the next six to 18 months. Previously, Mr. Straszheim had been forecasting weaker growth.    &quot;The U.S. economy is badly out of balance as the extreme volatility in the financial markets has attested,&quot; he said. Continued high federal and trade-account deficits suggest that &quot;trouble is brewing,&quot; Mr. Straszheim added.    Last week's December trade deficit, which narrowed to $12.2 billion, was viewed as only moderately encouraging in the markets.    Likewise, interest-rate watchers were blase about sharp gains in December M1, M2, and M3 money-supply numbers, out last week, because they were expected. While the signs indicate the Fed has been easing credit, analysts continue to worry about whether it will loosen enough. If the Fed doesn't continue to ease credit, &quot;a recession is a high probability this year,&quot; says Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.    Analysts are also keeping close tabs on manufacturing and trade in gauging the economy's health.    The January figures for industrial production and capacity utilization, due this week, are expected to be relatively unchanged from December.    Some unexpected strength -- attributable largely to auto sales -- in January figures for retail sales, out last week, bolstered hopes for continued consumer spending. January retail sales rose 0.5%, but excluding autos rose 0.2% from the previous month.    But a larger-than-expected jump in January's producer-price index, reported Friday, rekindled worries about inflation. The index rose 0.4% in January after dropping a like amount (adjusted) in December. -   ASK A HOG: PorkPro Newsletter notes that hog futures sank steadily during three of the past four recessions, proving that &quot;hogmen have an uncanny knack of beginning major expansions just as the country is entering a recession.&quot;    Cattle futures, on the other hand, seem to rebound nicely during recessions after an initial drop, says ProFarmer Newsletter, a sister publication. Currently, barnyard barometers aren't calling for a recession, as hog futures are improving and cattle futures remain strong despite a post-crash stumble.    ---                   The Economy in Numbers            Statistics Released in the Past Week                                              CHANGE                                             (from prior                                   TOTAL      period) Trade Deficit Dec.
