The Washington Post, in its Friday editions, said the bureau wasordered to hold off by Treasury Department officials after the NRAraised objections.   The newspaper said senior BATF officials decided at a meetingThursday morning to announce the restrictions on the additionalmodels later in the day, according to an official familiar with theevents. But then they were instructed by the parent TreasuryDepartment not to proceed, according to the official.   James Jay Baker, a senior NRA official, said the group learned onWednesday night that other weapons might be added to the list offive types of assault weapons which drug czar William J. Bennetttemporarily banned on Tuesday and contacted Treasury officials whosaid there would not be any new restrictions, the newspaper said.   The ban announced by Bennett included the Chinese-made AK47 andthe Israeli Uzi, and covered about 80 percent of total imports ofsemiautomatic weapons.   ATF then sought to close the door on the semiautomatic weaponsnot covered by the initial ban, fearing that these firearms wouldfill the void, the Post said. In addition, BATF officials worriedthat manufacturers affected by the import ban would complain theywere unfairly singled out.</TEXT></DOC>
