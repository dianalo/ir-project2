Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommendedevaluating spent fuel pool expansions on a case-by-case basis.For Millstone Unit 1, the expansion of the storage capacity of the spentfuel pool will not create any significant additional radiological effectsor non-radiological environmental impacts beyond those assessed in theCommission's Final Environmental Statement (FES) issued in June 1973 relatedto the operation of Millstone Unit 1, in the safety evaluation and environmentalassessment issued June 30, 1977 in support of a license amendment concerningstorage capacity, and in the Environmental Evaluation related to conversionto a Full-Term Operating License issued December 17, 1984. The 1984 EnvironmentalEvaluation concluded that the FES was still adequate.The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation of the expandedspent fuel pool is estimated to be less than one percent of the total annualoccupational radiation exposure for this facility.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the proposed spent fuel pool expansion to the facilityrelative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR Part 51. Based on thisassessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiologicalor non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action and thatthe issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have no significantimpact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to10 CFR 51.31, no environmental impact statement needs to be prepared forthis action.For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applicationfor amendment dated June 24, 1988, as supplement by letters dated July29, August 12 and December 2, 1988, and February 14, March 1, March 22and April 10, 1989; (2) the FGEIS on Handling and Storage of Spent LightWater Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG-0575); (3) the FES for Millstone Unit 1dated June 1973; (4) Amendment No. 39 to the Millstone Unit 1 license datedJune 30, 1977; and (5) the Environmental Assessment dated June 6, 1989.These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at theWaterford Public Library, 49 Rope Ferry Road, Waterford, Connecticut 06385.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 7th day of June, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John F.
