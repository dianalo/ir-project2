It was the latest sign of crumbling support for PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's order to cut off all oil, most natural gasand some raw material shipments to the Baltic republic in hope offorcing it to rescind its declaration of independence.   On Wednesday, the Kremlin gave the first sign it may be ready toease the blockade because of mounting domestic opposition. Kremlinleaders offered a compromise that could lead to removal ofsanctions which have idled 26,000 workers.   Estonian Premier Edgar Savisaar on Thursday rejected the latestKremlin offers of greater independence within a Sovietconfederation, saying Gorbachev was still presenting the Balticrepublics with an ``ultimatum'' to suspend their independencedrives, Dutch media reported.   Savisaar was in the Netherlands to attend a gathering of12th-century Northern European cities known as the Hansa League.   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov was reported to have toldLithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene on Wednesday that 15percent of the republic's natural gas supply would be restoredsoon. That would bring gas supplies to 30 percent of normal.   No sign of the promised gas emerged Thursday, but the fertilizerfactory Ryzhkov said would be supplied was closed in any event fora day of mourning, said Rita Dapkus, a spokeswoman for theLithuanian parliament.   Residents in all three Baltic republics held services Thursdayremembering the 36,000 Lithuanians and 10,000 Estonians who weredeported to Siberia and the Far North on June 14, 1941, on ordersfrom Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Many died in the harshconditions there.   The three republics were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Unionwhile under army occupation in 1940. The deportations, even ofinfants, were allegedly due to anti-Soviet agitation.   Postfactum news service said the Moscow city council, which isdominated by radical reformers, is considering sending gasoline toLithuania in rail tank cars guarded by council members.   Food is always in short supply in the Soviet Union, but withrecent panic buying touched off by the government's plan to raisefood prices, Moscow officials are especially concerned aboutkeeping their current sources of dairy products.   Newly elected Russian President Boris Yeltsin already haspromised to send supplies to Lithuania, and presidents of severalother republics reportedly told Gorbachev in a Kremlin meetingTuesday that the embargo should be stopped.   At that Tuesday meeting, Gorbachev suggested transforming theSoviet Union into a new, looser union of ``sovereign states,'' inthe hope that will hold his country together.   Latvia and Estonia have joined Lithuania in demandingindependence, and several other republics have large organizationspushing for secession. Russia challenged Gorbachev's authority onTuesday by declaring that its laws would take priority overnational ones, and the Ukraine may follow suit.   A member of Gorbachev's Presidential Council advisory board,Grigory Revenko, was reported as saying on Thursday that theproposal for a new union treaty would allow each of the 15 Sovietrepublics to set its own conditions for joining the union, onfederative or confederative principles.   In Russian, these words are used to distinguish between aU.S.-style federation of states within one country and aconfederation of independent nations like the European Community.   ``Let them join the Common Market if they want it, and if arepublic has sufficient potential,'' Tass quoted Revenko as saying.   Revenko suggested that the central government be left withminimal duties, including constitutional and human rights, defenseand border protection, and part of foreign relations.   ``Republics themselves, when joining the union with theirtreaties, will determine which rights they will delegate to thecenter,'' Tass quoted Revenko as saying.   None of the three republics' parliaments took action Thursday oncompromise offers made by Gorbachev.   He told Lithuania the Kremlin will lift the embargo and opennegotiations on independence if Lithuania agrees to freeze puttingits declaration into effect while negotiations are going on.   Latvian legislators criticized President Anatoly Gorbunov forsaying he is ready to discuss freezing Latvia's May 4 declarationof independence, because he had no authorization, according to theEstonian news service ETA.   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel said in a newspaper interviewthat Gorbachev recognized Estonia's declaration that it is in atransition period to full independence, ETA said.</TEXT></DOC>
