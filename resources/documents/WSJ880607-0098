The company, whose stock never opened for trading yesterday pending its announcement, refused to say whether it had sent a merger proposal back to Mr. Fox, as was suggested in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing made by a group headed by Miami investor Laurans Mendelson.    The group, which holds a 9.9% stake in Heico, said in the 13D filing that it had a copy of Mr. Fox's May 13 letter and believed Heico had responded with a $30-a-share merger proposal. The filing was released Friday.    &quot;There was such a letter&quot; from Mr. Fox, said Thomas S. Irwin, Heico's senior vice president, finance and administration. &quot;But it doesn't represent an item we consider a material development, and therefore, something to be reported on&quot; to the SEC.    Asked whether Heico responded to the letter with a merger proposal, Mr. Irwin added: &quot;We have no comment on that in particular, except that there are no developments at this time to report on.&quot;    Heico, a maker of jet-engine combustion chambers, said shareholders have been subjected to a series of unusual announcements about proposed takeovers over the past three months that have raised &quot;false hopes.&quot;    In March, Mr. Fox, through his wholly owned H Acquisition Corp., made a tender offer for all of Heico's 2.1 million shares outstanding and 390,000 share options for $30 each, or $75 million. The offer, however, was quickly withdrawn.    Trading of Heico shares on the American Stock Exchange was halted Friday because of an order imbalance. The stock last traded at $25, up 50 cents.    The company said that after careful consideration, it has decided not to sell the company at this time. It added, though, that if a credible cash offer for the entire company at a favorable price is received, it would be considered. </TEXT></DOC>
