The legislation, which was expected, would require agencies that administer the programs to seek congressional appropriations for the subsidies that are implicit in federal loans and loan guarantees.    Joseph Wright Jr., deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters the legislation is needed because under the current system, it is difficult to &quot;tell the real cost&quot; of loan and loan-guarantee programs. The administration wants to establish &quot;good credit management,&quot; he said.    The administration also hopes that by requiring Congress to provide appropriations for the subsidies, lawmakers will be less generous in funding credit programs. Currently, only some of these programs require annual appropriations.    Under the administration plan, the government would use several methods to determine the subsidies. It would apply a market test to some federal loans, such as Small Business Administration loans and rural housing loans, that are slated for sale to private investors. The subsidy in these cases would be the difference between the loans' sale price and their face value.    For loans that aren't suitable for sale because of political reasons, such as foreign military-sales loans, the calculation of the subsidy would be based on a hypothetical sales price using comparisons with private loans.    For loan guarantees, the subsidy would equal the cost of purchasing private insurance to cover losses arising from defaults.    The current budgetary treatment for loans and loan guarantees doesn't identify the subsidy, Mr. Wright said. The full amount of a federal loan is counted as an outlay when it is made, whether or not the loan involves subsidy provisions, such as artificially low interest payments. A loan guarantee is counted as an outlay only when a default occurs; this creates the misleading impression when the guarantee is made that it's &quot;free,&quot; Mr. Wright said. </TEXT></DOC>
