But some officials at the Fed and elsewhere speculatedthat BCCI may have inflated or even fabricated much of thealleged political influence indicated in its records, giventhe shadowy nature of BCCI's Washington operatives and thebank itself, which is known to have falsified recordspertaining to billions of dollars of financial transactions.</LP><TEXT>   About a dozen people said to be on the list categoricallydeny having the slightest financial relationship with BCCI.Some had dealings with First American Bankshares Inc., whichBCCI secretly controlled for years, but these dealingsappeared to involve routine accounts at Washington's biggestbank holding company.   Regardless of the outcome of the political-influenceinvestigation in the U.S., it's becoming clear that in thecourse of growing into a $23 billion bank, BCCI used money tobuy power and influence.   In Washington, BCCI maintained an office whose size andoperations seemed to go well beyond those of mostforeign-bank representative offices. Until the office closedin April 1989, the company employed around 22 people,including secretaries and chauffeurs. Generally, suchrepresentative offices have only one or two staffers and asecretary.   The Washington office also boasted four luxury limousines-- three black and navy Mercedes and a Cadillac. Among thesenior members of the office were two senior Pakistani civilservants: Sultan Mohammed Khan, a former ambassador to bothWashington and Beijing, and M.M. Ahmad, a former Pakistanifinancial secretary. Both men declined to discuss theiractivities in Washington.   Amjad Awan, who was convicted of money-laundering chargesin federal court in Tampa, Fla., last year, also worked inthe Washington office before transferring to BCCI's Miamioffice in about 1985. In September 1988 -- when BCCI'scontrol of First American was still a secret from bankingauthorities -- Mr. Awan told an undercover Internal RevenueService agent in the bar of the Grand Bay Hotel in Miami, &quot;Weown a bank based in Washington; it's called the FirstAmerican Bank.&quot; It was &quot;bought out by BCCI&quot; in 1980, he toldthe agent, according to a transcript of the tape-recordedconversation filed in connection with the Tampa case, and hesaid the &quot;truth of the matter is that the bank belongs toBCCI.&quot;   The availability of such evidence as early as 1988 has ledto charges that the Justice Department hasn't vigorouslypursued suspected wrongdoing at BCCI.   In an interview yesterday, Robert Mueller, an assistantattorney general, rejected any such suggestion. &quot;We have hadthe only successful prosecutions to date,&quot; he said, referringto the convictions of BCCI and several of its officers in themoney-laundering case in Tampa last year. &quot;We are pursuingall leads in our investigation&quot; and are &quot;following up onallegations in three other cities&quot; in addition to Washington,he said. He didn't name the other cities, but federal grandjuries are known to be hearing evidence in Miami, Tampa andAtlanta.   Mr. Mueller also said that the Justice Department &quot;hadn'tbeen influenced by any agency, political or otherwise,&quot; inits investigation of BCCI and other matters.   Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, hascharged that the Justice Department has been refusing tocooperate with his investigation of BCCI. But Mr. Muellerrejected that charge and said he will meet with Mr.Morgenthau next week to iron out difficulties in exchanginginformation and witnesses.   &quot;There are pieces of evidence we wish to discuss withhim,&quot; Mr. Mueller said. &quot;We are aggressively pursuing ourinvestigation; he's pursuing his.&quot;   ---   Alan Murray contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
