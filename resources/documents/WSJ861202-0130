France has put off the decision for months. Following last-minute negotiations last week, Norwegian authorities said the outlook is still uncertain.    In June, Norway concluded an accord with natural-gas companies in West Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands that called for the $8 billion development of the huge Troll and Sleipner natural-gas fields in the North Sea and the building of a 682-mile pipeline between the fields and Belgium. France is the only country that hasn't approved the accord's terms.    Fearing that France won't come to terms, Norwegian authorities are finishing a scaled-down development plan -- valued at the equivalent of $3.07 billion -- that includes only the Troll gas field.    France has demanded trade concessions in exchange for allowing its state gas concern, Gaz de France, to fulfill its pledge to buy annually eight billion cubic meters of gas, valued at more than $20 billion dollars over the 27 years of the accord.    Paris is concerned that Norway's current trade surplus with France would widen because of gas deliveries from the Sleipner and Troll fields. So France has insisted that Norway narrow the gap by agreeing to certain counterpurchases of French goods and by awarding French companies construction and supply orders in connection with the development of the two gas fields.    If France declines to participate, a Ministry of Petroleum spokesman said, Norway will propose to develop only the Troll field, putting the Sleipner field and Belgian pipeline on hold. Under the scaled-down accord, gas deliveries would begin in 1995, and peak by the year 2000 at some 12 billion cubic meters of gas a year, instead of the originally planned 20 billion cubic meters.    The original agreement called for Norway to sell 450 billion cubic meters of gas between 1993 and 2020 to distributors in the four West European nations. The contract was valued at $64 billion, assuming an oil price of $28 a barrel. Gas prices are tied to the price of oil.    Gaz de France was to take 40% of total deliveries, with West Germany also taking 40% and Dutch and Belgian distributors splitting the remaining 20%.    A spokesman for Royal Dutch/Shell Group, designated operator of the Troll field, said a scaled-down development plan would cut the project's revenue by 40%, while capital outlays would fall only 0.8%, to $3.07 billion from an initial $3.33 billion.    Also, the loss of the Sleipner project would hurt Norway's oil-service companies, already hit by a sharp decline in oil-field spending. Order books at platform-construction companies and other oil-field suppliers will be empty by the end of next year, and industry analysts warn that a looming shakeout could take a heavy toll, even among some of Norway's largest industrial companies. </TEXT></DOC>
