(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fallen PTL founder Jim Bakker returned tothe Heritage USA theme park Tuesday and said he would try to buyback the ministry if it were liquidated in bankruptcy court.   ``I would set up offices near here, which I probably will do. Asevery peice of ministry comes up for sale, I would buy it torestore it to the people it was meant for,'' Bakker said in a breakin a meeting with PTL attorneys, his attorneys and Roe Messner, theprimary builder of the Heritage USA theme park.   ``I want to see the ministry restored 100 percent,'' Bakkersaid, adding right now it ``looks bleak'' for the ministry.   He said the meeting was to back up Messner's claims against PTLin the bankruptcy proceedings. Messner, next to the InternalRevenue Service, is the largest single creditor in the PTLbankruptcy proceeding.   Bakker left PTL after charges of paying off Jessica Hahn, achurch secretary, to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with him,and that was followed by revelations of a lavish lifestyle led byJim and Tammy Bakker.   When he came out of the World Outreach Center where the meetingwas being held, a group of about a dozen supporters shouted wordsof support and hugged him.   He said after the meeting he would be visiting friends andrelatives and riding around the grounds of PTL.   Bakker said he was there at Messner's request, and charged thatmost of the records he had left behind when he left PTL in March1987 have been destroyed.   ``Almost all of the blueprints of all the buildings aremissing,'' Bakker said.   When asked who might have destroyed the records, he said, ``Anyof them who might want to take over the ministry.''   Pressed for further specifics, he said, ``I don't know.''   Asked how he would buy back PTL, he said, ``I have a lot offriends.'' He again would not provide specifics.   Bakker said the meeting did not touch on whether he should comeback to the ministry, but that he would if he were asked.   ``I think everybody else has had a chance ... it's being soldoff. What would be wrong with giving Jim and Tammy a chance,''Bakker said.   The ministry is in bankruptcy court now, with up to $130 millionin debt, and a reorganization plan calling for the sale of much ofPTL's assets is up for final approval by U.S. Bankruptcy JudgeRufus Reynolds on June 16 in Columbia.   Before the meeting, Bakker told reporters he wants to meet withnew ministry trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to ensure the ministry'sLifetime Partners are given everything they're owed.   Bakker said he would like to meet with Charlotte, N.C.,businessman George Shinn. Shinn, owner of the Charlotte Knightsminor-league baseball team and the new Charlotte Hornets of theNational Basketball Association, is one of the people interested inbuying Heritage USA, and he would like to build a baseball stadiumthere.   Bakker didn't say how long he'd remain in the area, but said hiswife, Tammy, will join him in a few days.   Ryan Hovis of Rock Hill, another Bakker attorney, said theBakkers have left their home in California and are returning totheir home in Gatlinburg, Tenn.   Bakker is being investigated by a federal grand jury inCharlotte for possible mail fraud and tax evasion and is involvedin lawsuits with PTL and his former attorney Roy Grutman.   David Clark, who recently stepped down as PTL trustee, filed a$52 million lawsuit in January against Bakker, his wife and formertop aide David Taggert. Earlier, Bakker and Taggert sued PTL for$1.3 million and $187,000 respectively.   In March, Bakker sued Grutman for $10,000 for conflict ofinterest.   The Bakkers stayed at their former Tega Cay residence forseveral weeks in June 1987 as they attempted to regain control ofthe ministry from the Rev. Jerry Falwell. They also returned inOctober 1987 to visit Jim Bakker's father Raleigh, who was ill atthe time.</TEXT></DOC>
