(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Community leaders appealed for calm afterthe slaying of an activist who had sought to become the firstIndian judge in racially tense Robeson County, but two othercandidates reported receiving death threats.   Julian Pierce, 42, was killed in his home early Saturday bythree shotgun blasts fired at point-blank range, in whatauthorities called the first assassination of a candidate forpolitical office in the state. No arrests have been made.   Since the killing, Pierce's opponent in the judgeship race and afriend of Pierce running for office in Forsyth County have reportedreceiving death threats, The Charlotte Observer said today.   The Rev. Joy Johnson of the First Baptist Church said Sunday hehoped the crime could be solved ``before the heat rises and beforethere is a war.''   ``We've had a calm night and day, but it will take at least afew more days until the tension is out of the air,'' said Johnson,who along with other community leaders appealed to residents onSunday to avoid violence. ``Anything could spark something. I hopethat doesn't happen.''   Pierce, a lawyer, was running for a Superior Court judgeship inRobeson County, where few Indians hold office or work in lawenforcement, despite a population that is 37 percent Indian.   He was alone Saturday morning in his brick ranch house, which isflanked by farmland and another small house, authorities said.   ``The best we can establish, he got home shortly after midnight,he undressed and went to bed,'' said Robeson County Sheriff HubertStone. ``Then someone came to the back door, knocking. Pierceslipped on a pair of jeans and went to the door. When he got to thedoor, the person either shot through the window or stuck the gunthrough the window and shot Pierce in the chest.   ``As Pierce turned, he was then shot in the lower left side.Pierce fell to the floor,'' the sheriff said.   ``It just looked like he was actually assassinated,'' he said.   Earl Moore, who said he had known Pierce for 15 years, said thecandidate ``knew that something could happen'' to him. Moore saidhe knew of a threat against Pierce, but said he would talk only tofederal officials in Washington, not to county, state or federalofficials in North Carolina.   Jim Hatcher, a friend of Pierce who is running for a seat on theBoard of County Commissioners in Forsyth County, across the statearound Winston-Salem, told the Observer that he received ananonymous telephone call late Sunday in which someone said ``getout of town.''   ``I plan to talk to Gov. Martin,'' he said. ``The people arewanting to talk, but they're scared. Either Martin's going to dosomething, or else.''   Hatcher is the uncle of Eddie Hatcher, who, with Timothy Jacobs,took over The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton on Feb. 1 toprotest alleged government corruption in Robeson County.   Lumberton police said they began guarding District Attorney JoeFreeman Britt's home Sunday after he reported receiving threats.Britt, who was running against Pierce, and his family were inseclusion under police protection.   Pierce grew up in neighboring Hoke County and worked in aVirginia shipyard after graduating from college. He returned toNorth Carolina and attended North Carolina Central University lawschool, then worked for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionfrom 1976 to 1978.   He moved to Robeson County to serve as the first director ofLumbee River Legal Services, representing those too poor to affordlawyers and practicing public interest law.   ``He was an easygoing guy. He never had no problem with anyonethat I heard tell of. People liked him,'' Stone said.   Pierce's supporters said they might try to field anothercandidate in the upcoming primary.   ``The question is whether or not that will be allowed, under thegeneral statutes,'' said Sam Kerns of Pembroke. ``We'll be meetingagain ... but I really don't think that it may be possible,according to the law.''   Pierce's campaign manager, Harvey Goodwin, said supporters areconsidering a request for a special session of the stateLegislature to consider postponing the judicial race.   Britt, a white, has been district attorney in the county for 14years. But Pierce was considered the leader in the race because ofa controversial vote by Indians earlier this month to consolidatethe county's five school systems, which are divided largely alongracial lines.   The election was to be decided May 3, the date of the Democraticprimary, since no Republicans were in the race.   The judgeship Pierce had sought was created to help ensure thatminorities would have an opportunity to elect a judge. TheLegislature gave the county its own judicial district, separatingit from adjoining Scotland County.   Indian leaders met Sunday but would not allow reporters toattend. A meeting Saturday resulted in a request to state officialsto appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Pierce's death.   Robeson County, which borders on South Carolina, is also 37percent white and 26 percent black. It is one of the state'spoorest counties, and has long been torn by racial animosity.   Activism, particularly by Lumbees, has thrived since November1986, when a sheriff's deputy fatally shot an unarmed Lumbee.   Anger at what the Indians call corrupt local government andentrenched racism boiled over Feb. 1, in the hostage-taking at TheRobesonian newspaper.   Pierce's killing ``makes me think there's no hope for theIndians,'' said one Lumbee, Janice Locklear. ``I'm so mad I couldfight.''</TEXT></DOC>
