<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-31-0428 </DOCNO><TEXT>Techniques are described and demonstrated for the use of nuclear magneticresonance (NMR) to image solids and the potential uses and limitationsof NMR solid imaging are evaluated. Spatial resolution and line narrowingproblems are addressed and methods for removing the line broadening mechanismsare examined for the H 1 NMR imaging of organic materials. The homonuclearmagnetic dipole-dipole interaction, dominant among these mechanisms,was removed by applying a sequence of resonant phase-modulated rf pulsesto vary the spin system state. Line narrowing and Fourier imaging werealso combined to produce two-dimensional images of solids. NMR imagingwith a surface coil was explored. Test materials included epoxy, neoprenerubber, and adamantane. Comparisons are drawn with magnetic resonanceimaging methods.</TEXT></DOC>
