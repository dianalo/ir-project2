Annealing for one hour at600 and 800 degrees C substantially reduces the level of stress in thetube wall, but the compressive stresses remain measurable after suchanneals. The analysis of the data permitted determination of the principalaxes of the residual stress distribution from which it was found thatthe principal axes of stress nearly coincide with the principal directionsof the tube at high stress levels. The maximum effective stress levelobserved was near the yield stress of the material.</TEXT></DOC>
