Most of the presently available post-irradiationfatigue and crack propagation experiments are carried out at temperaturesover 750 K, whereas for NET the properties at temperatures in the rangeof 500 to 850 K are needed. The loading pattern, frequency and heliumto dpa ratio of the first wall are quite different from the existingrange of dynamic property measurements. There is no particular varietyof Type 316 steel that is clearly fatigue resistant, though additionof 0.3% Ti has some promise. The understanding of the basic mechanismsis so limited that generalizations required for extrapolations in lifeprediction are not possible. The most urgently needed information hasbeen identified. Post-irradiation low frequency fatigue and crack growthmeasurements including compressive hold-times are required. Comparisonof isothermal strain controlled fatigue testing with relevant thermalfatigue cycles is also essential. The present discrepancies between 'in-beam','in-pile' and post-irradiation results need a sound physical explanation.The mechanical property trends have to be explained from physical principlesin order to reduce the present uncertainties in life-time predictions.</TEXT></DOC>
