(Acquisitions, mergers, divestments)InterConnections Inc. (Acquisitions, mergers, divestments).andO;Ticker:    EMLX.andO;Topic:     AcquisitionContracts.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Thursday at the INTEROP 91 trade show, Emulex Corp. announced an intendedacquisition that it said would supply software technology to fuel its driveto become a leading player in the network computing market for communicationsand storage devices.andM;Emulex has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire InterConnectionsInc., a privately owned company that supplies software for interconnectingpersonal computers to Digital Equipment Corp. (Digital) VAX computers vialocal-area networks (LANs).andM;The transaction is expected to close before the end of October, subject tothe satisfaction of certain conditions.andP;  The acquisition will be a cashtransaction in which Emulex will purchase all the InterConnections stockoutstanding.andP;  No purchase price was announced.andM;Emulex, headquartered in Costa Mesa, Calif., is a supplier ofhigh-performance data storage and networking products as well assystems-level integrated circuits for the computer industry.andM;Discussing the strengths of the combined companies, Emulex president andchief executive officer, Robert N. Stephens, said: &quot;InterConnections providesboth intimate knowledge of network operating system technology and the keysoftware elements required to fulfill our strategy to be a leader in opensystems networking.andM;&quot;Their PC LAN-to-VAX communications solutions provide transparent networkcommunications for multivendor environments.andM;&quot;Our terminal and printer server product lines now provide networkingconnections for UNIX and Digital systems.andP;  However, as PCs proliferate, manyother network standards will come into play.andM;&quot;The addition of the InterConnections products gives Emulex one of theindustry's widest range of networking solutions for the desktop.andP;  The productlines will support Novell NetWare, Microsoft's LAN Manager, the UNIXnetworking standard-- Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP), and Digital's Local Area Transport (LAT) protocol.&quot;andM;INTERCONNECTIONS PROFILE InterConnections, which was established in 1986, isbased in Bellevue, Wash., and will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary ofEmulex.andP;  InterConnections has current annual revenues of approximately $4million and serves over 1,000 customers, including over half of the Fortune500 companies and many major international firms.andM;Key products include Leverage for NetWare, Leverage for LAN Manager and thenew Leverage for PATHWORKS software.andM;The InterConnections product line consists of software designed to provideuser-transparent connections for Novell NetWare, Microsoft LAN Manager,TCP/IP-based PC local area networks (LANs) and VAX minicomputers.andM;Novell and Microsoft together account for over 80 percent of all PC LAN nodesinstalled, according to International Data Corp., while TCP/IP has emerged asthe major standard for open systems networking.andP;  With the InterConnectionssoftware, users on the PC network can access Digital VAX computer resources,such as files and printers, in a totally transparent manner.andM;InterConnections software also allows the VAX user to utilize printersattached to a NetWare LAN, and to bridge two NetWare LANs together over aDECnet backbone network.andP;  These users can also emulate a terminal connectionto the VAX from their PCs.andM;InterConnections software is unique in that it provides true internetworkingcapabilities between PC-LAN networks and Digital host-based networks.andP;  OtherPC-to-VAX communications products, including Digital's PATHWORKS, connectindividual PCs to the VAX.andM;These approaches require proprietary networking software in each PC, plusadditional host software to allow the PCs to be simultaneously connected to aNovell or LAN Manager network.andP;  InterConnections has implemented the PC LANfunctionality directly on the VAX host computer, eliminating the need forspecial software in each PC.andP;  As a result, PC LAN users are not required tolearn new commands and procedures.andM;EMULEX PROFILE Emulex Corp. designs, manufactures and markets data storageand networking products as well as advanced integrated circuits for thecomputer industry.andP;  Emulex offers products compatible with a number ofdifferent systems including Digital Equipment, IBM, Small Computer SystemsInterface (SCSI) and UNIX markets.andM;Emulex's storage product lines include controller boards, peripheralsubsystems and host adapters.andP;  Network Communications products includelocal-area network terminal and printer servers and communicationscoprocessors.andP;  Emulex micro devices provide systems-level SCSI technology formanufacturers of high-performance disk drives and host computer systems.andM;Revenues for fiscal 1991, ended June 30, were $152.9 million and net earningswere $7.8 million.andP;  Emulex employs 850 people in its Costa Mesa, Calif.andO;corporate headquarters, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dorado, Puerto Rico andsales and services offices worldwide.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
