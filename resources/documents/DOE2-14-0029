A survey of 48 ofthe 96 operating faces for 1987 indicates unit shift productivity rosefrom 1,234 clean tons of coal in 1986 to 1,609 tons in 1987. This continuesthe strong upward trend of the past two years that has seen average unitshift productivity rising 47%, from 1,092 clean tons to 1,609 tons. Theaccompanying table shows the detailed results from the 1987 LongwallProductivity Survey. The survey results from 48 faces are separated intothree cutting ranges: high (80 to 120 in.; medium (53 to 80 in.); andlow (below 53 in.). Average, maximum and minimum values are shown foreach range. The high cutting range (80 to 120 in.) showed the best productivityincrease (39%), rising from 1,603 tons per unit shift to 2,223 tons inthe span of a year. Frequency and difficulty of equipment moves, however,prevented this increase from fully benefiting the total face tons perman-day, which rose only 20% to 156 tons.</TEXT></DOC>
