(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   All is not as it seems in this wooded,idyllic slice of the Allegheny Mountains known as the EnchantedHills.   True, the Cattaraugus Creek still snakes through sylvan glades ofthe Zoar Valley as it has for centuries, cutting a 200-foot gorgethat enthralls the trout fisherman and thrills the whitewater rafter.   But less than a mile away, a cluster of white buildingssurrounded by barbed wire marks the site of some of the most highlyconcentrated radioactive waste in the world, stored in a massiveunderground tank.   If released into the environment, the resulting radiation fromthe corrosive, near-boiling liquid would make the scenic areauninhabitable for almost as long as it took to make the gorge. It isthe legacy of a former nuclear fuel reprocessing operation.   That ominous distinction has made West Valley, 35 miles south ofBuffalo, the scene of the nation's first large-scale attempt to tryout radioactive waste treatment technology.   The principles tested here are expected to be used in stabilizingsimilar wastes at federal installations in Savannah River, Ga. andHanford, Wash., both of which have significantly greater amounts ofradioactive wastes.   ``We're proving that the nation can deal with nuclear wastessafely and effectively,'' says Willis Bixby, the Department ofEnergy's project director.   Many environmentalists disagree, however, pointing out thatmodern science does not yet know how to render radioactive wasteharmless.   The goal of the $700 million project is to get the liquid wastesout of the aging tank and into a more stable form.   Although other countries, such as France, which relies on nuclearpower for 70 percent of its energy needs, have been using thetechnology for 20 years, the United States has simply stockpiled itsnuclear wastes until now.   West Valley was the nation's only commercial reprocessingfacility. During the late '60s and early '70s, it took in spent fuelfrom nuclear power plants around the country and extracted usableuranium and plutonium. The byproduct of the process was some 600,000gallons of waste.   When it was built in the mid-1960s, New York Gov. NelsonRockefeller saw the facility as an opportunity for the state to getin on the development of a technology that promised to solve thenation's energy needs. He envisioned a massive nuclear complex thatwould include reactors and research facilities.   But that promise all but disappeared a few years later asdeclining markets, tougher federal regulations and the radiationhazards to workers forced the facility, run by Getty Oil Co., toclose.   It was inoperative from 1972 until 1982 when the federalDepartment of Energy began the West Valley Demonstration Project, amultimillion-dollar cleanup effort.   The first step in a complicated process that has taken years toset up is to filter the liquid waste through columns filled withzeolite, a sandy clay. The filtering reduces the radioactivity ofthe liquid by 99 percent. The liquid is then blended with cement andpoured into 71-gallon steel drums. Officials expect to produce some15,000 of the drums, each weighing 1,000 pounds, by 1994.   The remaining, concentrated zeolite wastes are to be transformedinto 300 glass logs. The 10-foot logs will eventually be shipped toa federal repository for high-level wastes scheduled to be opened inNevada in the year 2003. Until then, the glass logs are being kepton the site.   West Valley Nuclear Services Co., a Westinghouse Electric Co.subsidiary handling the project, activated the treatment systemslast spring with some 500 people involved in operations. Inside thewhite buildings, technicians in green jump suits with metersattached to their collars to measure their exposure to radiation useremote controls to pump the wastes through filters andsolidification processes.   Except for an incident in 1986, when 11 construction workers werecontaminated after passing around a contaminated tool, there havebeen no major problems at the facility. All but one of the workerswere back on the job several hours later.   Project director Bixby thinks the safety record will contributeto greater public acceptance of the nuclear power industry.   ``We can't make up for the negative publicity of Three MileIsland and Chernobyl,'' he says. ``But we can be a positive factorwhen people consider the risks of energy sources and begin tore-evaluate nuclear energy.''   Increasing attention to the wastes produced by combustible fuelsand the so-called greenhouse effect and acid rain will lead peopleto reconsider nuclear power, he said.   Local environmental activists, however, say the project willprove otherwise.   ``It's impressive what they are doing, but it's no solution,''says Carol Mongerson, a member of the Coalition on West ValleyNuclear Waste. ``All we've really done is change it from one form toanother.''   Mongerson says solidified radioactive waste remains harmful forthousands of years. A single glass log will give off some 8,500rems, enough radiation to kill a person exposed only for a fewminutes.   The coalition sued the state and federal governments to forceWestinghouse to conduct an environmental impact study of its plansto hold cement drums in a vault at the site. A federal judge ruledthat until the study is completed, the company must store the drumsin a temporary facility.   Mongerson says West Valley officials are engaging in a lot of``wishful thinking'' about the future of the nuclear industry.   ``There really isn't any feasible way of dealing with thebyproducts,'' she says.   Meanwhile, life in the nearby farming community life proceedsundaunted, with residents scoffing at suggestions of a catastrophicaccident at the site.   ``Heck, we're the ones who make up those glow-in-dark jokes,''says Bernard ``Bud'' Williams, supervisor of the town of 2,000people.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Jan. 15</NOTE></DOC>
