The report also said McDonnell Douglas Corp. was one of the fewmajor defense contractors to post a sales increase for the year. TheSt. Louis-based company assumed the top industry position with salesof $657 million.   The value of contracts awarded to U.S. defense contractors formilitary equipment and services earmarked for export abroad fell to$4.9 billion _ off 22 percent from the 1986 level and 44 percentbelow 1985's total, the report said.   The study examined sales in the 12-month period ended Sept. 30.   ``The overall decline in Foreign Military Sale awards led to adrop in the level of arms export business for 17 of the top 25 U.S.arms exporting companies in 1987,'' the report said.   The study was conducted by the Investor Responsibility ResearchCenter, which bills itself as a non-partisan research organizationdedicated to conducting impartial studies on public policy issuesinvolving corporate America.   The group has been analyzing foreign arms sales for severalyears, focusing on the official Foreign Military Sale, or FMS,transactions, that are arranged and overseen by the U.S. government.FMS sales account for about 84 percent of all U.S. arms exports; theremainder normally involved company-to-country agreements.   The research center waits until complete government tabulationsare available for each fiscal year, meaning there normally is a lagof more than a year. The latest report was mailed out this week.   Center officials attributed the steep decline in U.S. overseassales to a small drop in overall demand coupled with an increase incompetition.   ``The biggest reason for the dropoff has to do withcompetition,'' said Paul Ferrari, a center spokesman. ``It's atighter market out there.   ``It's still a good business, but a lot of the oil-rich countriesand developing nations either don't have the funds anymore, or theyhave stocked their arsenals to the brim for the time being.   ``And the demand is slackening off a little bit at the same timethere are more suppliers in the market, including countries likeBrazil and South Korea.''   Ferrari said the fiscal 1987 totals would not have dropped nearlyas much if Congress had not blocked Reagan administration proposalsto sell new jet aircraft to such Middle East countries as SaudiArabia.   Pentagon figures show that based on deliveries of equipment infiscal 1987, the Middle East ``continued to be the largestrecipients of U.S. military exports in 1987,'' Ferrari said.   Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt led the way in that region, headded.   The six largest U.S. arms contractors account for 55 percent ofthe total FMS awards in fiscal 1987, the study said.   Besides McDonnell Douglas, they are General Dynamics Corp., whichhad $606.9 million in foreign sales; Grumman Corp., with $503.7million; General Electric Co., $341.5 million; Raytheon Co., $326.2million, and United Technologies Corp., $223 million.   General Dynamics had held the top spot two years ago with salesof $1.4 billion.   Rounding out the top 10 arms exporters were Lockheed Corp.,$197.1 million; General Motors Corp., $194 million; Unisys, $173.1million, and Westinghouse Electric Corp., $122.7 million.   The center said the export contracts for fiscal 1987 benefitedthe states of New York, California, Massachusetts, Texas andMissouri the most.   The awards to contractors in New York totaled $706 million,compared to $686.7 million for California; $541.6 million forMassachusetts; $522.9 million for Texas, and $499.5 million forMissouri.</TEXT></DOC>
