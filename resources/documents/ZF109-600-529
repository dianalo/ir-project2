 First, there were nearly as many high-end colorprepress vendors as at Graph Expo; Scitex, Crosfield, Hell and Screen, forexample, were at both shows.andP;  Second, the color products being developed forthe general computer market are leaving an indelible impact on thistraditional market.andP;  Vendors of traditional equipment are building bridgesbetween their equipment and the desktop products, and the desktop productsjust keep getting better.andM;In this issue, we look at the vendors of products geared toward servicebureaus, trade shops or color prepress specialists.andP;  In our November issue ofthe Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing we cover new products designed formore general-purpose use.andP;  In an increasing number of cases, the lines blur.andO;Here, we have covered the new Macintosh link for the Itek and Screentraditional scanners; in the other report, we'll cover color printers fromAgfa and Iris that may well be used as proofing devices by professional tradeshops.andP;  In other cases, the decision remains straightforward.andP;  Our pick asthe highlight of this section is Screaming Color's RipLink, a new softwarepackage developed by a color trade shop.andM;Coddbarrett shows storable clip artandM;Coddbarrett demonstrated a new custom clip art tool for its TintPrep systemthat enables frequently used items, such as logos, to be stored on disk withall trapping information.andP;  The clip art, which can be used withoutrecoloring, can be resized, rotated and placed on pages.andM;Dalim refines product--but faces crisisandM;Dalim demonstrated its color system on Tektronix workstations, as it has donefor years, only to find after the show that Tek is pulling out of theworkstation business.andP;  With no hardware to run on, Dalim left vacant itsstand at IFRA.andP;  We'll have more details on Dalim's platform plight in ournext issue.andM;We were impressed by some of the new developments shown in San Jose.andP;  Theyincluded adding brush tools (texture copying, edge-smoothing, smearing,contrast-enhancing and airbrushes), brush shapes and degrees of transparency.andO;Particularly intriguing is a brushstroke recording system allowing theoperator to replay a series of brushstrokes with different settings or with adifferent brush.andP;  Up to eight such recordings can be made.andP;  There is nofacility for editing the sequences or for using only part of one.andP;  Also newis the ability to clip an image to any shape, including text.andM;Full Color adds formatsandM;The Full Color Publisher retouching software is one of the more impressivenew retouching systems in the marketplace.andP;  We covered its showing earlierthis year at the Seybold Seminars (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  13, pp.andP;  35-36).andP;  InSan Jose, Full Color was hosted by Optronics and Silicon Graphics.andM;The Full Color retouching system first sold in the photo imaging markets, butit is now moving much more into prepress.andP;  Thus, its new developments weresupport for graphic arts standards, including the DDES standard for contoneimages (ANSI IT8.1) and the Scitex Handshake and CT2T formats for imagetransfer.andM;Full Color and Optronics announced an agreement that makes Full Color areseller of both the Optronics ColorGetter input scanner and the OptronicsColorSetter imaging unit.andP;  Full Color's software also supports the Solitairetransparency recorder as well as the Kodak LVT and MacDonald Dettwilersecond-generation transparency imaging units.andM;The Silicon Graphics workstation can accommodate one to four processors.andO;Full Color can offer a variety of price/performance points by running on thisplatform, which is also used by Barco and Xyvision Design.andP;  Its software hasalso been ported to the IBM RS/6000.andM;Full Color is working on support for Aldus's OPI and Quark's DCS formats fortransferring images into PageMaker and Xpress pages.andP;  These efforts arecurrently undergoing beta testing.andM;Hell stresses cooperation, opennessandM;In spite of the fact that its champagne breakfast went bubbleless because ofNew York's prohibition of Sunday morning consumption, Hell used Graph Expo tolaunch a new effort aimed at promoting the use of its equipment in colorservice bureaus.andP;  It also focused on open systems and cooperation with othervendors in product interfacing and integration.andP;  A similar effort was made atthe Seybold event the following week.andM;Color service bureaus.andP;  The Hell Color Service Bureau program is intended tomake Hell a partner, rather than a vendor, of service bureaus using Hellequipment.andP;  Among the benefits service bureaus will receive are amillion-dollar national advertising campaign, in-depth training on ways tointegrate desktop publishing into a quality color environment, consultingservices from Hell and other desktop publishing experts, and development ofleads and referrals.andP;  One focus will be on making good use of theScriptMaster link between Hell systems and desktop PostScript products.andO;ScriptMaster now accepts Scitex Visionary files.andM;ChromaLink PC and Tool Kit.andP;  In emphasizing its open interfaces, Helldemonstrated ChromaLink, a network interface that permits Hell systems tosupport popular scanners and recording engines from other vendors.andP;  It wasintroduced at Drupa, where we called it Hell's version of the ScitexHandshake.andP;  Among the announced interfaces are those to the Canon CLC500color printer, the Autokon 2030 flatbed scanner, the MacDonald Dettwiler Fire1000 film recorder, the Iris 3024 proofer, the Mitsubishi G650 thermalprinter, the Du Pont 4Cast, the AP Picture Desk and devices from Contex andGerber.andP;  And ChromaLink enables Scitex, Crosfield and other systemssupporting DDES IT.8 interface standards to exchange data with Hell'sChromaCom using nine-track mag tape or Exabyte 8mm tape, or, in the case ofScitex, direct two-way communication.andM;ChromaLink PC, the off-the-shelf package, supports SCSI, GPIB and RS232interfaces.andP;  Hell also offers the ChromaLink Tool Kit, which enablescustomization of the interface to meet particular needs and systemrequirements.andM;We had a good chance to look at its nice user interface at Graph Expo.andP;  Theaccompanying photos show the way ChromaLink is set up and some of what it cando.andM;BridgIt developments.andP;  Hell also announced versions of its BridgItimagesetters running in PC and Sun Sparcstation workstations.andP;  UsingPostScript interpreters from Harlequin (in Europe) and Hyphen (in the U.S.),andO;they drive Ultre's 72- and 94-pica recorders.andM;For the PC version, Hell recommends a 25-MHz '386 or '486 CPU, afloating-point coprocessor, 8 MB of memory and 100 MB of disk storage.andP;  Themachine includes 35 Adobe fonts and supports ethernet and LocalTalkinterfaces.andP;  The Sun version, which uses the SunView graphic interface orSun's Unix editor, works best with 16 MB of memory.andP;  It can be networked viaEthernet, TCP/IP, NFS or Tops.andM;The PC system costs $29,995 for the 72-pica version and $39,995 for the94-pica machine.andP;  Pricing of the Sun configuration will be announced inDecember, when both new packages will be available for shipment.andM;Howtek: progress on two frontsandM;Howtek serves two different markets.andP;  One is for the Colorscan system, acomplete color page makeup and separation system sold through a dedicatedsales force.andP;  The other is &quot;Personal Color Products,&quot; which includes desktopscanners and printers sold through a distribution network.andM;Howtek has just appointed Paul White (formerly marketing VP of BedfordComputer) as its new senior vice president for graphic arts.andP;  In this role,White will head up the marketing of the Colorscan system.andP;  Howtek reportsabout 75 Colorscan system sales worldwide, most of which are in the U.S.andM;In the desktop peripherals area, Howtek has been selling scanners in largenumbers.andP;  About 120,000 Howtek monochrome scanners have been sold, and itsnew $2,595 color model is creating a lot of interest.andP;  Tech Export, Howtek'sinternational distributor, has placed an order for $1,000,000 of Howtek gear,including 850 of the new scanners.andP;  This is Howtek's largest order ever.andM;Howtek has reached an agreement with Adobe to bundle a limited version ofAdobe Photoshop with each color scanner.andP;  It will have Photoshop'simage-manipulation features, but not the color separation capabilities.andO;There will be an upgrade option for those who want full Photoshopcapabilities.andM;Imapro adds 1,200-dpi color scannerandM;Imapro has taken the Sharp JX-600 color scanner, made some substantialengineering modifications to the optics, and put it in the Imapro productline as the QCS-1260.andM;First, it replaced Sharp's three-mirror optical path with a two-mirroroptical system.andP;  For transparencies, it replaced Sharp's three-bulb lightdiffuser unit with a rotating-bulb illumination system; the bulbs are kept atuniform intensity by feedback loops in the control electronics.andP;  Finally,Imapro added a switch-selected option to boost the scan resolution.andP;  You canscan at 600 dpi (the same as Sharp offers) on images up to 11.7&quot; X 17&quot;, oryou can double the resolution to 1,200 dpi if your image is no bigger than5.8&quot; X 17&quot;.andM;The Sharp scanner's CCD array nominally digitizes up to 10 bits of toneinformation per color.andP;  Imapro added some dark-correction software that issaid to boost the effective digitization accuracy to the equivalent of 12bits.andP;  This signal is used as the index into a lookup table, which outputs8-bit values to your computer.andP;  In principle, you will get a 24-bit colorfile with better shadow detail than the unmodified Sharp unit can deliver.andM;Imapro is charging $29,900 for the QCS-1260, which includes a 90-daywarranty.andP;  Shipments have begun.andM;Intergraph shows its EdgeandM;Intergraph has been inching its way into the color prepress market, first inthe U.S.andP;  (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  6, pp.andP;  31-32) and then, starting at Drupa,worldwide (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  19).andP;  DP/Studio, a subset of its I/Image line,was the focus at this exhibition.andP;  The color package is tailored for thegraphic arts market.andM;DP/Studio runs on an Intergraph 6280 workstation that contains the new EdgeII display technology.andP;  At Drupa, Edge II was not operational; the earlierEdge I display technology was used.andP;  This was was our first opportunity tosee DP/Studio running on the latest technology.andM;We were very impressed with the performance provided by the Edge IItechnology.andP;  It allows the full, high-resolution scanned image to bemanipulated and edited in real time on the screen.andP;  Edge II is built usingdigital signal processor technology to provide superior performance overconventional graphics cards.andM;Strong type.andP;  The system has full support for text that can flow from frameto frame.andP;  Bitstream outline fonts are used and are displayed as real type onthe screen.andP;  They can be modified in any way, including full rotation,coloring, scaling, distortion and other effects.andP;  Output is only inPostScript format.andP;  The quality of text placement and composition appears tobe substantially better than that of many other color systems in themarketplace.andM;The basic functions of color manipulation are strong in performance andquality; one has a full retouching system with excellent masking, fullmontaging and rapid display.andP;  Images are rotated at high speed or scaled orcropped on the screen, and color values are adjusted interactively.andM;The system also contains a whole range of vector drawing tools.andP;  Objects maybe colored, edited and manipulated as you would expect in most geometric artprograms.andM;A variety of color models are offered: RGB, CMYK, HSL or Pantone.andP;  Colors arechanged by adjusting curves, moving sliders for each of the colors, or keyingin direct values.andP;  These different models can be mixed when creating masks.andO;Global color corrections may be applied within any of the models.andM;There are still some limitations.andP;  For example, masks must have hard edges,although you can use a blend retouching brush afterward to improve the edge.andO;Intergraph is working on being able to define a soft edge mask with adefinition of how many pixels the mask should be spread across.andM;DP/Studio's user interface is a mixture of keyboard commands and on-screenicons.andP;  The icons are all around the edge of the screen, surrounding theimage.andP;  One problem we did notice, particularly when working with a 27&quot;monitor, is that there is an awful lot of hand-eye movement to move betweenicons.andP;  The two-button mouse is also a serious shortcoming, particularly forretouching, for which it is too clumsy.andP;  Intergraph is working on supportinga pressure sensitive pen as an alternative.andM;With DP/Studio, the user may make up pages as well as retouch images, but theproduct will interface with other systems through newly developed OPI andQuark DCS filters.andP;  When passing high-resolution files to PageMaker orXpress, Intergraph offers DP/Color SP, its color separator.andP;  A currentlimitation of this product is its inadequate trapping controls.andP;  Again, thisis something Intergraph is working on.andM;Intergraph could be a real challenger in the mid-range color market.andP;  Itsproduct offers considerable functionality, and it is one of the fastest colorsystems we have seen (only in demonstrations, admittedly).andP;  Its closestcompetitors appear to be color vendors that are using Silicon Graphics astheir hardware supplier (Barco, Full Color Computing)--SGI's Iris series isamong the few boxes that are competitive with the Intergraph workstations atthis time.andP;  Having seen the demonstration, we look forward to seeing how wellIntergraph's product stands up in a production environment.andM;A DP/Studio package consists of the 14-MIPS Intergraph 6280 workstationequipped with the Edge II display, 48 MB of RAM, 670 MB of disk and a 19&quot;color monitor.andP;  A special, unusual option is Intergraph's gigantic 27&quot;display screen in place of the 19&quot; monitor.andM;DP/Studio works with the Optronics ColorGetter scanner and the ColorSetteroutput unit.andP;  (Optronics is an Intergraph subsidiary.)andP;  A minimum packageminus the scanner and output device costs $58,000.andP;  A complete system with aColorGetter and a ColorSetter costs approxiamtely $260,000.andM;Lower-priced systems can be obtained by buying a less expensive Intergraphworkstation and sacrificing performance.andP;  For example, one could use the new2020 workstations for page assembly, but not retouching.andP;  A 2020 workstationwith a 12.5-MIPS processor, 128-color display and a 19&quot; color monitor costsless than $25,000.andM;Itek connects to desktopandM;Itek Colour Graphics exhibited in cooperation with High-Water Designs to showhow its high-resolution color scanners could be linked into Macintosh or Sunenvironment.andP;  The connection was made through a device called Picstore, aidedby new enhancements to the Itek 310 color scanner.andM;Picstore.andP;  Picstore is an interface device between the high-end colorscanning market supprted by Itek and the desktop publishing page assemblymarket.andP;  It is a &quot;black box&quot; containing a Motorola 68020 processor and arange of interfacing and storage capabilities developed by HighWater.andP;  Itsupports transfers standards such as OPI, to allow for low-resolution tohigh-resolution file conversion.andM;At the Exposition, Itek 310 was scanning either RGB or CMYK contoneseparations into the Picstore.andP;  In the Picstore, low-resolution TIFF imageswere created from the high-res files and transferred into a Macintosh forpage assembly.andP;  Completed pages with low-resolution images using OPIextensions were then sent back into the Picstore, where they were combinedwith the high-resolution data and passed on to an imaging device working inPostScript.andM;In the demonstration, the Picstore used an RS-232 serial control interfaceand an 8-bit parallel interface for connecting to the scanner.andP;  The systemhad up to four 1.4-GB disks as well as Ethernet and SCSI interfaces.andM;Itek demonstrated Picstore linked to the Macintosh, but it could equally wellbe linked to other hardware, such as PCs or Unix workstations.andP;  Picstore willalso support transfer of data in other formats using devices such as Exabytetapes or 1/2&quot; magnetic tapes.andM;Itek 310 enhancements.andP;  We saw some improvements on the Itek 310 scanner tosimplify its operation when working in online mode.andP;  The improvements make iteven easier to crop and scale than before.andP;  Itek scanners have always beenrecognized for their quality and ease of used; with these latest changes, itappears that the 310 could fill a niche for high-quality scanners in theupper end of the desktop color market.andP;  The scanner plus Picstore is animpressive combination for capturing and storing high-quality images.andM;Itek believes that it is often best in this environment for scanning to bedone in CMYK format, which is not recognized for input by some of the desktopapplication programs.andP;  However, its scanner will write the files in RGB ifneeded.andM;The pricing of an Itek S-310 scanner, together with its preview monito, isapproximately 50,000 pounds.andP;  Picstore with a 780-MB disk costs about 25,000pounds.andM;NPS adds dedicated systemsandM;Networked Picture Systems has broadened its product offerings with two newturnkey systems for color processing: Design Express for image retouching andExpress Tinter for creating flat tints.andP;  These two products have been splitoff from Page Express, the comprehensive system that covers the full range ofcapabilities.andP;  Both new systems were demonstrated at Graph Expo, where thelatest version of Page Express also was shown.andP;  The new Page Expresss 3.2adds some important features to its manipulation capabilities, includingexpanded trapping for text, masking, vignettes and drop shadows.andM;New modules.andP;  Design Express is now NPS's primary image-enhancement product,replacing Image Express, which will continue to be available.andP;  Design Expresshas a more attractive user interface.andP;  It supports photo retouching,point-to-point cloning, rotation, a range ob brush shapes and styles,scaling, tapering, perspective and special effects such as gradations andposterization.andP;  It works with CMYK, RGB and HSV color spaces.andM;Finished images can be output to NPS's Page Express or directly to animagesetter or proofing device.andM;Express Tinter includes the ability to colorize line art as well as toassemble pages using most of NPS's standard capabilities.andP;  It supportsassignment of CMYK and Pantone color values to scanned black-and-white lineart from Scitex, Hell and Du Pont (Highlight) systems, and user-definedtrapping (chokes and spreads).andM;Page Express enhancements.andP;  NPS also showed its latest release of PageExpress, 3.2, closely following 3.1 which we hadn't seen before.andP;  The focusof 3.2 is expanded trapping to allow assignment of spreads and chokes bothfor text generated on the system and for PostScript files imported andconverted to bitmaps.andP;  Positive and negative trapping values can bespecified, as can CMYK or Pantone values for each trap.andP;  Traps may be set forline work in conjunction with other line work or with contone images.andM;Other new features in version 3.2 are the ability to manipulate the originaCMYK data for a CMYK image, including the black value, and to generatehigh-resolution output for images created with 3D illustration programs.andM;New in version 3.1 is support for viewing contone separations on the screenand real-time image positioning.andP;  Also new is masking within Page Express,which can be done by freehand drawing, with circles or polygons, orautomatically by density.andP;  Zooming and panning can be implemented for editingshapes.andM;A new automatic drop shadow feature for type or other elements enables theuser to define the color (in CMYK or Pantone colors), the x and y offsets forthe shadow, and the blur width--the amount of edge blurring desired foreffect.andM;Vignettes can be applied to images horizontally, vertically or split(horizontally or vertically), with the user assigning the starting and endingpercentages.andP;  NPS doesn't support radial vignettes (from the center out), butits vignettes are of good quality, not banded as on many desktop systems.andM;Changes in system hardware include the availability of a large bitpad (25&quot; x18&quot;) in addition to the existing small one (12&quot; x 18&quot;) and a '486 PCplatform.andM;Users.andP;  NPS gave us the names of some users that we can contact to discusstheir work and the productivity of the system.andP;  NPS said one of its keyfeatures for users is the ability to serve as a gateway between varyinghigh-end input/output devices, such as accepting scanned data from onehigh-end system, making up pages on Page Express, and outputting to adifferent brand of recorder.andP;  We'll have more details after we've talked tothe users.andM;Pantone offers toolkitandM;Pantone has introduced a toolkit for software developers.andP;  It is intended tohelp them create accurate Pantone colors on their displays.andP;  The heat of thesoftware is a table of CIE coordinates representing the appearance of PantoneMatching System (PMS) colors under six conditions: there are three printingconditions (solid ink on coated stock, solid ink on uncoated stock, nearestequivalent combination of process inks) viewed with two types of light (colortemperature 5,000 of 6,500 degrees).andM;From the CIE values, the software derives the particular values needed forthe display and output device in use.andP;  For monitors, the user can pickTriniton, calibrated Triniton or NTSC.andP;  Some intense colors may beundisplayable, in which case the software offers two choices: preserve thehue and sacrifice some of the brightness, or vice versa.andP;  The software candisplay the entire PMS color range as small squares on the screen; in thisdisplay, the undisplayable (out-of-gamut) colors are marked with an X.andM;Pantone has also established a convention for software developers to use whenstoring PICT files containing PMS colors.andP;  Without such a convention, thecolor would be stored as an RGB combination like any other, and the fact thata specific PMS color was intended would be lost.andM;Screaming prepress-to-Mac linkandM;RipLink, from Screaming Color, was one of the highlights of the fall shows.andO;It is an alternative to the desktop-to-prepress links being offered byScritex, Crosfield and Hell.andM;RipLink.andP;  RipLink is a set of Macintosh software modules for converting filesbetween prepress systems and Macintosh software.andP;  Screaming Color recommendsrunning RipLink on a Macintosh IIfx with 8 MB of RAM into which is connecteda 9-track magnetic tape or Exabyte magnetic tape drive.andP;  RipLink reads avariety of prepress formats, including Scitex Handshake CT and CT2T, HellChromalink, DDES CT (ANSI IT8.1), and Scitex, Hell and DDES (IT8.2) line artformats.andP;  Screaming Color plans to support Crosfield and the other DDESformats as well.andP;  On the desktop side, RipLink handles Quark DCS format plus8-, 24- and 32bit TIFF.andM;To show how the system works, we took a Hell line art file scanned on aconventional Hell scanner and converted it into a packed, monochrome TIFFfile.andP;  We then brought the image into Letraset ColorStudio, where wecolorized it, then output it in 8-bit palleted TIFF format.andP;  Next, weconverted the file into a Scitex format for output into a Scitex system.andP;  Wethen put it through Screaming Color's Mac-based trapping program to performthe necessary trapping prior to writing it to the Scitex system format.andP;  Indoing so, we also converted PostScript data into the Scitex format by runningthe file through a built-in Hyphen software RIP within the Macintosh, whichcreated a line art format.andM;Everything was done on the Macintosh at high speed.andP;  The user may work onejob at a time or set up batch operations for unattended, continuousconversions.andM;One powerful component is RipLink's trapping module.andP;  With it, one definesvarious levels of trapping and the percentages of color for each.andP;  Forexample, in trapping into a darker color, the operator may decide that wherethe trap occurs the color percentages change to avoid two solid colorstrapping into each other; instead, user-defined percentages of those colorsmay be substituted to create a lighter, more pleasing overlap.andP;  Trapping maybe run as a batch program or on a job-by-job basis.andM;RipLink contains a number of other interesting elements.andP;  For instance, aprogram called Resolver cuts the processing time of Hell's Konti ROS orCCPage operations, which are run when you merge the contone and line artfiles prior to output.andP;  Screaming Color claims that Resolver reduces theprocessing time on the Hell system by optimizing some of the work beforehand.andM;Practical approach.andP;  RipLink opens up new possibilities for mixing high-endand low-end technology.andP;  For example, we saw an ideal application of theLetraset ColorStudio Shapes program in which Shapes was used to createirregular masks for an image.andP;  The file was then given an OPI-like extension.andO;(Aldus's OPI specification includes only rectangular boxes.)andP;  With thisextension, RipLink was then able to pass the mask back to the prepresssystem--providing an inexpensive masking tool offline from the Scitex or Hellsystem.andP;  This is the first time we've seen such irregular masking passed froma generic Macintosh program to a prepress system, and it shows how RipLinkmay make it possible for trade shops to marry their prepress systems to new,off-the-shelf technology.andM;Bridges like RipLink will also complement the new interfaces to Macs, PCs andUnix workstations that are being developed for high-resolution color scanners(see Itek above).andP;  As the desktop computers become powerful enough to handlehigh-resolution files, such links become more feasible.andP;  Some customers maydecide to use imagesetters for output, but others may want to rely on a colorservice bureau or printer that has a traditional prepress system.andP;  In thatcase, a bridge like RipLink is needed.andM;It is not surprising that RipLink is a practical approach to marryingprepress and desktop technology.andP;  The distributor, Screaming Color, is acolor trade shop, not a traditional vendor.andP;  Screaming Color was notsatisfied with the products it could obtain from Scitex and Hell.andP;  In lookingelsewhere, it found the developer of RipLink.andP;  It liked the product so muchthat it made an exclusive agreement to market his product.andM;An example of how RipLink is a practical, cost-effective solution (not just anod to market demand for links) is that its link runs offline from theprepress system.andP;  In the prepress vendors' online links, the large systemgets tied up waiting for the conversions.andP;  With RipLink, the conversion isoffline, so it need not communicate with the prepress system--the conversioncould even take place on a shift when the prepress system is down.andP;  Thisapproach makes interfacing with desktop color systems much more attractiveand cost-effective.andM;RipLink is not a low-cost system, but it equates very well in price withproducts like Scitex's PS Bridge and VIP, Hell's ScriptMaster or Crosfield'sStudioLink.andP;  The software for RipLink costs $41,500.andP;  Screaming Color letsthe user buy the Mac II and the magnetic tape drives.andP;  Given its advantages,particularly the offline processing, it delivers considerable value for themoney.andM;Screen eyes PostScript OEM marketandM;Like the other major color vendors, Screen (formerly DS America) used GraphExpo and the Seybold Exposition to launch its Drupa products in the U.S.andO;There were relatively few changes since Drupa because of the extraordinarynumber of new products launched in April.andP;  However, there were several newproducts not at Drupa.andP;  The first is its lowest-cost scanner/recorder; thesecond is a pair of OEM products based on the same mechanics.andP;  The OEMproducts mark Screen's entrance into the PostScript market.andP;  A third newproduct is a $13,000 monochrome scanner.andM;SG 2010/2020 scanner/recorder.andP;  The new SG2010/2020 drum scanner/recordercombination includes input and output units at a competitive $100,000 price,plus an optional preview.andP;  This machine can be equipped with a SCSI port andcan produce TIFF files, but it is not clear that this option makes sense withthe current crop of PCs and Macs: the data rates produced are so high thatthey could overwhelm the receiving system.andP;  Screen is evaluating this problembefore deciding whether to recommend the SCSI option.andM;ISC and IGR: split, OEM products.andP;  For the OEM market, Screen has split the2010/2020 units into two separate products: the ISC 2010 and the IGR 2020.andO;The products have the same mechanics, but the SCSI interface is standard, andother options, such as a PostScript RIP on the recorder, are added.andP;  The SG2010/2020, in contrast, runs as a standalone unit and has its own colorseparation electronics.andM;The ISC scanner would be connected to the Macintosh via the SCSI interface,allowing high-resolution images to be scanned one at a time into thescanner's RAM buffer, from where they could be passed to the Macintosh.andP;  Thisapproach sends the high-resolution file directly to the workstation.andP;  Itdiffers from the Itek Picstore, which transfers a low-resolution version tothe Macintosh and then makes note of transformations before substituting thehigh-resolution image when the file returns.andM;The scanner with a SCSI interface and data buffer is targeted at an end-userprice of $79,000.andP;  The IGR 2020 output unit sells for $85,000 and includes aHyphen software RIP that runs in a Macintosh.andP;  (It uses Hyphen's dotgenerator, not Screen's.)andM;Screen is the latest high-end company to make its move down into thePostScript marketplace.andP;  Its ISC and IGR units compete directly with theOptronics ColorGetter scanner and ColorSetter recorder.andM;ISM monochrome scanner.andP;  The other new item that Screen showed was the ISM301 CF monochrome image scanner.andP;  This desktop unit scans at resolutions ofup to 400 dpi or interpolated (pseudo) resolutions up to 800 dpi.andP;  It has a4,000-element CCD array, and it generates images with up to 256 levels ofgray in TIFF, PICT or MacPaint format.andP;  The scanner handles a maximumdocument size of 17&quot; x 11.6&quot;.andM;This is a much lower specification monochrome scanner than the 10,000-CCDunits introduced by Screen at Drupa.andP;  The ISM 301 CF costs about $13,000 inthe U.S.andM;Shima Seiki grows in creative marketandM;Within the graphic arts creative markets, the Quantel Graphic Paintbox hashad few competitors.andP;  Some new products have focused on retouching, but forcreating sophisticated, high-resolution, paint-oriented, original artwork,the Paintbox defined the state-of-the-art.andP;  Its specialized hardware, whichprovides exceptional speed, and sophisticated software make it an expensivesystem few can afford.andP;  Those who can are loath to give it up once they haveit.andM;Shima Seiki is a new potential competitor for Quantel.andP;  (So is Barco, whichwe covered in depth at Drupa.)andP;  A Japanese firm, Shima Seiki showed itsGraphic Image Station SDS-480 SGX and the Shimatronic Design System at CPC'90.andM;The Shima Seiki systems looks for all intents and purposes like a QuantelGraphic Paintbox.andP;  It contains the same Sony HDTV high-resolution monitor anduses powerful proprietary image processing technology to facilitate itsimpressive functionality and performance.andP;  (Products such as Shima Seiki'sand Quantels are said to have around 1,000 MIPS of computing power forspecific graphic functions--somewhat different from Macintosh creativesystems!)andM;Shima Seiki is targeting the same creative market as Quantel.andP;  Its biggestU.S.andP;  customer to date is Ford Motor Company.andM;From clothes to color design.andP;  Like some other prepress suppliers (Scitex,Diadem), Shima has a background in textiles.andP;  Shima Seiki is a major Japanesesupplier of automated knitting machinery.andP;  From that base, it evolved intoautomated machinery and graphic design products designed for producingclothing.andP;  The Shimatronic design system, however, goes much further thanthis, into high-level creative areas.andM;We have seen this system before and have been pleasantly surprised.andP;  Itperforms full real-time manipulation of the high-resolution image.andP;  Anexample to show the speed: in order to find an image, the operator usedsingle pen selections to skip through high-resolution images, bringing eachimage to the screen in full size in a fraction of a second.andP;  (The user canalso select images from a thumbnail view of all images at one time.)andM;The system integrates with the high-end prepress market, supporting DDES andScitex CT2T and Handshake formats.andP;  It passes contone files; Shima leaves thescreening up to the prepress system.andM;Similar in power, price.andP;  Based on a short demonstration, it is difficult tocompare this system fully with its competitors.andP;  Its creative functionalityseemed similar to that of Barco's Creator or Quantel's Paintbox, although itdoes not offer as many type facilities as Barco nor the direct interfaces toscanners that Quantel can provide.andM;Shima Seiki's pricing is also similar to that of competing vendors in theover-$250,000 range.andP;  The price depends upon the amount of image memory: onecan have anything from 2,000 x 2,000-pixel display memory up to a fullcomplement that can handle 8,000 x 8,000.andP;  However, we do not quote suchprices because we understand that few systems are ever sold at list price byvendors in this market; major discounts are usually given.andM;Wright signs ScantronixandM;Wright Technologies, the Australian company whose products we described atDrupa, made its first U.S.andP;  appearance at Graph Expo.andP;  Wright makeselectronic products for color prepress shops.andP;  The company is establishing anetwork of distributors in North America, the first of which is Scantronix inLos Angeles.andM;The Wright products include the Sparcstation-based Jupiter workstation (forassembling pages out of images, tints and text), the PC-based IOpage-planning workstation (for creating precise page geometry and geometrictint areas), the Prepare workstation (for cropping, scaling and anglingtransparencies before scanning), the Scan Control workstation (for storingand retrieving scanner setup data), the Archive Data Management softwarepackage (for keeping track of 9-track tapes) and various interfaces forCrosfield scanners.andM;Jupiter can transfer data to and from Crosfield, Scitex and Hell 9-tracktapes.andP;  Wright offers online interface boards for Crosfield scanners, and itis developing interfaces for Hell, Itek and Screen scanners.andM;In the short interval since Drupa, several refinements have been added to theJupiter workstation.andP;  Image resizing and rotation to arbitrary angles are nowdone by indicating two image points and their desired new locations.andP;  Animproved &quot;automasking&quot; function, based on color boundaries, has been added.andO;Color-curve modifications, using the standard CMYK curves, is now available.andO;(You can't see the results of these changes on the screen, however, so youwould need a high-quality proofing device nearby.)andP;  Wright will soon get aperformance boost from moving to the Sun Sparc 2 workstation from the currentSparc 1+.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
