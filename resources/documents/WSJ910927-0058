A tight Judiciary Committee vote became evident yesterday,as two more Democrats announced they would oppose thenominee, who now sits on the federal appeals court here. Sen.Howell Heflin (D., Ala.), who had given conflicting signals,said he would vote against Judge Thomas, as did Sen. HerbKohl (D., Wis.), whose opposition was expected.</LP><TEXT>   In a separate development late yesterday, a Washingtonlegal publication reported that Judge Thomas may have triedto smooth his confirmation by delaying the release of acontroversial appeals court opinion opposing licensingpreferences for women.   Two key Thomas supporters -- Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D.,Ariz.) and Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) -- had questioned thenominee closely on affirmative action, and aides said theywere interested in reading the report in the weekly tradepaper, Legal Times. A spokesman for Sen. DeConcini, however,cautioned against speculation that the moderate Democratwould change his mind on Judge Thomas.   Senate staff members predicted that the committee votewould go ahead as planned. One possible effect of the LegalTimes report could be a delay before the full Senate votes onthe nomination. And the timing of that vote could determinewhether Judge Thomas will join the high court for the Oct. 7opening of its fall term, when the justices will heararguments in a major school-desegregation case. If he isn'tconfirmed by then, Judge Thomas won't be able to participate,unless the court asks the parties to reargue the case.   The committee's six Republicans, along with Sen.DeConcini, have said they will back the nominee. Sen. PatrickLeahy (D., Vt.) earlier had announced his opposition.   The four Democrats who haven't formally announced theirdecision are Chairman Joseph Biden of Delaware, EdwardKennedy of Massachusetts, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, and PaulSimon of Illinois. But based on their questioning over twoweeks of hearings, Sens. Kennedy, Metzenbaum and Simon arealmost certain to oppose the nomination.   Sen. Biden has said that the committee will send thenomination to the full Senate even if there is a tie ornegative vote. Over the past week, a number of centristsenators from both parties who aren't committee members havestepped forward to support Judge Thomas, prompting lawmakersto reiterate predictions that the nomination would beapproved.   The Legal Times report cited unnamed courthouse sources asspeculating that Judge Thomas had delayed release of a&quot;nearly finished&quot; opinion denying a woman a license awardedby the Federal Communications Commission under agender-preference policy. Proving that Judge Thomas purposelywithheld the opinion for political reasons would bedifficult, since appelate judges frequently mull decisionsfor a long time. But the substance of the opinion, if it wasaccurately reported by Legal Times, could itself galvanizeJudge Thomas's liberal critics.   Telephone calls late yesterday to Judge Thomas's chambersweren't answered. Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.), the nominee'smain sponsor in the Senate, dismissed the Legal Times reportas insignificant. &quot;The only thing unusual here is thatspeculation about a pending case has emerged from thecourthouse before the case has been decided,&quot; Sen. Danforthsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
