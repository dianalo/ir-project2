The mixture, suspended in gelatin, wasgiven to rabbits by gastric gavage. Rabbits were killed 4, 24 and 48h after treatment. Cholesterol and its autoxidation products were separatedby thin-layer chromatography into 5 fractions and radioactivities ofeach fraction were measured. Percentages of each fraction of cholesteroloxidation products and cholesterol in the original mixture before administrationand in the rabbit sera after administration were similar, suggestingthat the rates of absorption of cholesterol oxidation products are notsignificantly different from that of cholesterol. Lipoproteins were fractionedby ultracentrifugation into VLDL, LDL and HDL. Radioactivities of eachfraction in lipoproteins separated by thin layer chromatography showedthat fractions containing cholestane-3{beta}, 5{alpha}, 6{beta}-triol,7{alpha}- and 7{beta}-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol were moreselectively transported in VLDL, whereas most of the 25-hydroxycholesterolwas present in LDL. HDL contained only minute amounts of cholesteroloxidation products. 22 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
