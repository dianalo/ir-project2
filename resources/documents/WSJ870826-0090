Haley once flew fighter jets over Vietnam. Now, he runs a railroad. He says he isn't sure which holds more peril.    &quot;I flew 105 combat missions in Vietnam,&quot; says the 51-year-old former Air Force pilot. &quot;I got shot at every night. The railroad business isn't as bad as night combat -- but it's getting close.&quot;    Several years after he got out of the service, Mr. Haley led a group that borrowed $75 million -- against the advice of friends -- to start a new regional freight line, the Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific Railroad.    Mr. Haley says the Waterloo, Iowa-based railroad is on the threshold of financial success. But the railroad's major lender, General Electric Credit Corp., apparently believes otherwise. Last week the General Electric Co. unit, which had lent the $75 million to buy the line from the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad in 1985, attempted to oust Mr. Haley and take control.    &quot;I built up the railroad, and now they're telling me to take a walk,&quot; says Mr. Haley, who, as president and chairman of the 750-mile Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific, is vigorously resisting GE Credit in an Iowa state court.    On Monday, the court temporarily blocked GE Credit from interfering with the railroad or taking possession of its assets.    GE Credit apparently has been disappointed with the railroad's performance. The Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific had counted on brisk grain shipments to boost profit in 1986, its first full year of operating. But the grain market fizzled and while the market has since rebounded, the railroad had to invest more money to improve track speeds to attract time-sensitive merchandise freight such as automobiles, auto parts and containers.    Where Mr. Haley comes out in all of this interests those in the burgeoning ranks of short-line and regional railroad operators. After deregulation of the railroad industry in 1980, hundreds of new railroads were created as the major railroads sold lightly used track. Most of the new railroads are short lines, with fewer than 100 miles of track; some are longer, regional lines of more than 500 miles.    The new railroads, of which the Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific is one of the largest and most innovative, are betting that by reducing costs and boosting service, they can turn surplus rail lines into financial winners. Some analysts believe their chances are dim, because many of the new owners are undercapitalized and face huge rehabilitation costs.    An imposing 6 feet 2 inches tall and a fast talker, Mr. Haley is a frequent speaker at rail industry conferences, where he expounds on the virtues of a cooperative approach to labor. Mr. Haley, who earlier had made a name for himself in the real estate business in Iowa, has become something of a pioneer among short-line operators by persuading rail unions to make widespread work-rule changes in return for incentive bonuses tied to efficiency gains. Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific operates with two-man crews, for example -- half the industry average.    Mr. Haley &quot;has become a hero to other short-line operators,&quot; says Robert G. Lewis, publishing director of Railway Age, a trade magazine. &quot;He's built confidence in the ability of short-line railroads to be self-sustaining.&quot;    With the labor savings, Mr. Haley has reduced rates to attract freight business lost to truckers or other railroads. The Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific &quot;has taken business from us,&quot; says James Wolfe, chairman and president of CNW Corp., which is trying to reduce its rail labor costs to better compete with new regional operators.    Even so, Mr. Haley concedes, the Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific was only marginally profitable last year. It earned $110,000 after debt service payments to GE Credit on revenue of $57.5 million.    Mr. Haley says he has been negotiating with GE Credit to defer certain interest payments through the rest of this year so that the railroad could fund much-needed track repairs on its main line, which stretches from Chicago to Omaha, Neb. He says he was also seeking to lure investors to buy out the GE Credit loan, when GE Credit moved last week to remove him and appoint a successor. Mr. Haley says GE Credit planned to impose cost-cutting measures, including layoffs of about 200 of the railroad's 650 employees and elimination of incentive bonuses paid to rail workers.    GE Credit declines to comment. But a source close to the lender says, &quot;Mr. Haley is a captivating guy and he says the right things about short-line railroads. But the financial results have to be the judge of his success or failure, and the railroad is having some difficulties.&quot;    Mr. Haley, a fourth-generation railroader whose grandfather was killed in a wreck on the Union Pacific Railroad, vows to fight to keep control. &quot;I did something no one thought I could do: negotiate new labor contracts that gave us tremendous productivity gains,&quot; he says. &quot;The unions didn't give that to GE Credit; they gave it to me because I said I was going to market the railroad.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
