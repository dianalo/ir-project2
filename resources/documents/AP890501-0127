A technical report commissioned by the environmentalorganization said the Soviet submarine on April 7 took ``asignificant amount of highly active and toxic radioactivematerials'' to the bottom, 5,296 feet beneath the surface.   ``If the submarine is not recovered intact then it is, in ouropinion, inevitable that all of this material will disperse to themarine environment,'' said the report by the independent nuclearengineering consultants John Large and Associates Ltd. of London.   Forty-two seamen were killed and 27 survived when the vessel,armed with two nuclear torpedoes and reportedly fueled by uranium235, caught fire and sank 120 miles southwest of Norway's BearIsland.   The report said the nuclear reactors may have contained up to 20million curies of radioactivity and the reactor hull parts 1million curies. Greenpeace said its figures are conservativebecause they do not include the radioactivity of the reactors'liquid metal coolant or the toxic plutonium of the torpedoes.   The No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, bycomparison, emitted an estimated 50 million curies of radiationafter it caught fire in the Soviet Union in April 1986.   The report said much of the radioactive material aboard the MikeClass submarine will continue to emit radiation and be harmful tomarine and human life for many tens of thousands of years.   ``This vast quantity of radioactivity is mainly from highlyactive materials which will remain highly toxic to organisms almostindefinitely,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Damian Durrant.   ``Inevitably, they will be released and a proportion absorbedinto the marine food chains, through fisheries and toward man. Theonly question is when the reactors breach and this process begins.''   Director Johan Baarli of the Norwegian National Institute ofRadiation Protection said in response to the report, ``There is noreason to doubt that the sub's reactor is in its containment.According to all information we have, there is no radiationleakage.''   The institute said last month that tests showed the submarine'sreactors and weapons have apparently withstood tremendous waterpressure. Water samples collected near the submarine showed noradiation that could be attributed to it, the institute said.   The Soviet news agency Tass quoted Deputy Prime Minister IgorBelovsov last month as saying a decision on whether to raise thesubmarine is months away.   The report does not discuss the possible impact of leakedradioactivity on the marine environment.   ``This requires a further study dependent on the provision ofmore information from the Soviet Union, as requested by Greenpeaceas well as the Norwegian government, but which neither have thusfar received,'' Greenpeace said.   The report noted that when the United States tried to raise aSoviet Golf Class nuclear submarine in 1974 the vessel broke inhalf.   It said recovery should not be regarded as a ``quick technicalfix for this or future nuclear submarine accidents'' and called forelimination of all 544 military nuclear reactors from ships andsubmarines worldwide.</TEXT></DOC>
