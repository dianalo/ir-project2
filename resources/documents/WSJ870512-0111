The answer is to provide fewer dollars and more yen.&quot;    Adjusting money supplies is indeed, as you assert, the way to stabilize exchange rates. But that does not necessarily require providing &quot;fewer dollars and more yen.&quot; It requires tightening U.S. monetary policy relative to Japanese monetary policy. Relative tightening implies no particular dollar growth rate. It implies only that the growth in dollars decelerate relative to the growth in yen. That deceleration might be achieved, for example, by cutting the growth in dollars by 10% while increasing the growth in yen by 10%. Or it might be achieved by increasing the growth in dollars by 10% while increasing the growth in yen by 30%. Obviously any dollar-yen exchange rate can be stabilized at any dollar growth rate, as long as the yen grows relatively faster or slower, as required.    It is widely appreciated that conscious and explicit coordination of monetary policy among sovereign authorities is difficult. This difficulty is usually portrayed in terms of a clash of interests over exchange rates. But the real problem stems from the inability of sovereign authorities to coordinate their monetary growth rates. An agreement to stabilize the dollar at, say, 150 yen would be relatively easy if it did not entail interdependent monetary policies, robbing the Fed, or the Bank of Japan, or both, of important degrees of monetary freedom. Sterilized intervention is the attempt to have your cake and eat it too: to stabilize exchange rates without sacrificing monetary freedom. As you rightly note, it is bound to fail, at least among large countries with well-developed financial markets and large capital flows.    Surely Japan has sovereign rights to its own targets for growth and inflation and its own independent assessment of the macroeconomic policies required to attain those targets. So do we. Japan has every right to negative inflation and a sluggish economy -- if it will accept the exchange-rate consequences. We have every right to unlimited budget deficits, monetary expansion and resurgent inflation -- if we will accept the exchange-rate consequences. Except by coincidence, independent policies and preferences won't mesh at a stable exchange rate. Given clashing preferences, the only alternatives to the &quot;chaos&quot; of floating are: (1) for one side to persuade the other to change its policies; (2) for one side to subordinate its policies to those of the other, or (3) for all to subordinate their monetary policies to an external mechanism, such as a gold standard.    Ruling out (3) as impractical in today's world, &quot;international monetary reform&quot; is the search for new ways to implement (1) or (2), or some combination. Bretton Woods collapsed because the subordination it entailed became intolerable. Floating offers, in principle, a small degree of freedom from that subordination, but it, too, will fail if governments abuse that degree, and refuse to accept the consequences.    Floating fails when governments try to escape from the verdict of the exchange markets on their policies by resorting to direct controls over trade and capital flows. Because this latter threat is now so severe, the world is right to talk about &quot;international monetary reform,&quot; if only as a delaying game. But idealistic talk should not deceive; stabilizing exchange rates requires dependence and subordination, not the freedom for everybody to do their own thing.    Ben W.
