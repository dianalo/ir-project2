A spokesman for the company said the loss would be wider than its loss in 1985 of $115.1 million after a $137.8 million write-down. For the first nine months of 1986, the oil and gas limited partnership had a net loss of $14.7 million.    Apache said the write-down reflects lower oil and gas prices. Raymond Plank, chairman, said that the company is &quot;encouraged&quot; by the recent increase in oil prices but that it hadn't yet seen an increase in natural gas prices and volume.    Mr. Plank added that the company's distribution &quot;will continue to be reviewed quarter by quarter.&quot; Apache yesterday declared its regular quarterly distribution of 17 1/2 cents a unit, payable March 1 to units of record Feb. 15. </TEXT></DOC>
