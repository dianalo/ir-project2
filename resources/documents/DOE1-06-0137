In both systems, L/subIII/ edges clearly demonstrate a concentration-induced valence change.The Eu valence admixture is found to be inhomogeneous in nature. EXAFSand XANES experiments show the existence of well-defined local environmentswhich are typical of those encountered for Eu/sup 2+/ and Eu/sup 3+/in the Eu/Pd system.</TEXT></DOC>
