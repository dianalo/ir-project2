Preliminary results from air samples taken in Kuwait andSaudi Arabia showed there weren't significant amounts of themost harmful chemicals in the sky-blackening soot from morethan 500 oil-well fires.</LP><TEXT>   The team of experts, led by the Environmental ProtectionAgency, still advised military commanders in Kuwait torestrict physicial activity of troops and provide face maskson heavy air-pollution days to keep particulates of soot frombeing sucked deep into the soldiers' lungs. It is the sameadvice given during smog alerts in the U.S.   Long-term health effects from the unprecedented pollutionin Kuwait, including possible instances of cancer, still aredifficult to predict, though, and U.S. officials say morehealth research and air testing is needed. EPA chief WilliamReilly said he plans to visit the Persian Gulf in the nexttwo or three months to discuss long-term monitoring of theair pollution and health effects.   &quot;The best we can tell at this point at least is people arebreathing in soot. The particulates aren't carrying thechemicals of major concern for which we were testing,&quot; saidJim Makris, an EPA emergency preparedness official who headedthe first scientific assessment of health risks posed by theoil fires.   Soot can be a health problem to children, the elderly, orthose with respiratory ailments. But the more acute threatfeared by scientists were toxic chemicals, including sulfurand heavy metals, often found in oil wells or associated withfires. It is believed the intense heat of the oil fires hadsome benefit by incinerating some harmful elements.   Air samples taken in Kuwait failed to turn up any harmfulamounts of poisonous hydrogen sulfide or sulfur dioxide, thechemical blamed in the &quot;killer fogs&quot; that killed 18 people inDonora, Pa., in 1948 and some 4,000 in London in 1952.   Toxic contaminants sometimes attach to soot particles,making them more dangerous if ingested. But the tests run bythe U.S. experts so far haven't found any heavy metals, suchas chromium, or any harmful unburned hydrocarbons, such asbenzene. The study cautioned, however, that it hasn't beenable to check for all contaminants.   Winds are usually strong in Kuwait through July, so thesmoke will dissipate quickly and often will be blown out overthe Persian Gulf. However, the experts found there ispotential later in the year for weather inversions, in whichstagnant air masses can trap pollution near the ground forextended times and increase its harmful health effects.   The smoke isn't rising high enough into the air to affectthe global climate, the study concluded. A few atmosphericscientists had warned it might. But nothing much is knownabout the likely effects of the soot fallout or air pollutionon vegetation in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, or of pollutionreaching Iran across the Persian Gulf. Nor is it knownwhether smoke will reach Pakistan and India and affect themonsoons there.   The study recommends that the U.S. provide technicalassistance to the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments to continuemonitoring the air and to set up a forecasting system soneighborhoods can be alerted when air-pollution levels growunhealthy.   Mr. Makris said scientists also may be interested intracking residents and military personnel exposed to theintermittent smoke to learn more about long-term healtheffects of soot. The report suggests that scientists canlearn so much from Kuwait's oil fires about the effects ofsmoke on air chemistry, climate and solar radiation that thefires &quot;could circumvent the need for many years of studydirected at much lesser phenomena.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
