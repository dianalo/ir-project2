By a 6-3 vote, the court said the documents can be withheldbecause they were ``compiled for law enforcement purposes'' _ andtherefore are exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailinggovernment secrecy.   Grumman and the Defense Contract Audit Agency exchanged lettersin 1978. In the exchange, the Pentagon agency questioned certainaccounting practices Grumman used for defense contracts. Grummandefended its practices, and no government action was taken.   The FBI began a criminal investigation of Grumman in 1985, andthe exchange of letters was sent from the audit agency to the FBI.   Grumman filed an FOIA lawsuit in 1987 seeking ``all documentsthat are related in any way to the subject of the (1978)correspondence.''   A federal judge ruled against the contractor, saying release ofthe documents would jeopardize a grand jury investigation.   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City ruledthat the FOIA requires release of the documents.   The appeals court said the exemption for documents compiled forlaw enforcement purposes does not apply in this case because theletters were not originally obtained or generated for lawenforcement purposes.   Today, the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong aboutthe exemption's scope.   ``Documents having been compiled once for the purpose of routineaudits wer not disqualified from being compiled again later for adifferent purpose,'' Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court.   ``We do not accept the distinction the court of appeals drewbetween documents that originally were assembled for lawenforcement purposes and those that were not so originallyassembled,'' he said.   Blackmun said sought-after documents may fall under the FOIAexemption if they have been gathered or stored by a law enforcementagency ``when the response to the FOIA request must be made.''   Blackmun's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist and Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R. White, SandraDay O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.   Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Thurgood Marshalldissented.   The case is John Doe Agency vs. John Doe Corp., 88-1083.</TEXT></DOC>
