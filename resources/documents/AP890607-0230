The action, if followed by further moves by the central bank toloosen its grip on credit, will spell lower borrowing costs forbusinesses and consumers, including declines in mortgage rates, theeconomists said.   A move to lower interest rates would mark a major policy shift bythe central bank, which launched a campaign in March 1988 to pushinterest rates higher in order to fight inflation.   Federal Reserve Governor Martha Seger refused to respond directlyto reporters' questions today over whether the Fed had indeedloosened monetary policy. However, she said, ``Let me put it thisway: I have been opposed to further tightening since late lastyear.''   Ms. Seger, who has been a frequent dissenter inside the Fedarguing for lower interest rates, responded with a terse ``nocomment'' when asked whether the Fed should do even more in pushinginterest rates lower.   She said following a congressional appearance that it stillremained to be seen whether the Fed's year-long anti-inflationcampaign had slowed economic activity so much that the country wouldtopple into a recession.   The Bush administration, which has been pressing the Fed to easeup and keep the economy out of a recession, had nothing but praisefor the central bank on Tuesday, with the president's chief economicadviser, Michael Boskin, saying he had ``utmost confidence'' in theFederal Reserve.   The Fed, as usual, made no announcement of any change in policy,but economists who closely watch its activities said they believedthe central bank had eased slightly, based on declines this week inthe federal funds rate.   This rate, which is the interest that banks charge each other tomake overnight loans, is considered the best early-warning signal ofFed intentions.   The central bank influences the rate through daily decisionsabout how much money it will make available to the banking system.   The federal funds rate had been averaging between 9.75 percentand 9.88 percent, but it dipped to around 9.63 percent on Monday anddropped further to around 9.56 percent on Tuesday.   ``The Fed has eased and we are looking for the federal funds rateto go lower,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data ResourcesInc., a private economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.   Ms. Latta and other analysts said they believe Fed policy-makershave become convinced that the economy has slowed enough to easeinflationary pressures.   Starting in March 1988, the Federal Reserve had pushed short-terminterest rates up by 3 percentage points in a campaign to cool offan overheated economy by making credit costlier.   Eliott Platt, director of economic research for Donaldson, Lufkinandamp; Jenrette, predicted that a host of business and consumer loanrates will head lower in the months ahead as the Fed loosens creditfurther in an effort to keep the economy out of a recession.   On Monday, major banks announced that they were cutting theirprime lending rate by one-half percentage point to 11 percent, thefirst reduction in this benchmark lending rate in more than a year.   Platt said he looks for the prime rate to fall to 9.5 percentover the next three to six months.   Other economists predicted that mortgage rates are headed lower.Fixed-rate mortgages have already fallen to a national average of10.48 percent last week, down from close to 11 percent at thebeginning of May.   Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers,refused to comment specifically on the question of whether the Fedis now pursuing a credit-easing approach.   During an appearance Tuesday at the National Press Club, Boskindid say that the administration has a ``great deal of confidence''that the central bank will steer a prudent course between fightinginflation and guarding against a recession.   Earlier in the year, both the president and Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady had criticized the central bank for being overlyconcerned about inflation at the risk of harming economic growth.   Boskin said Tuesday that it made sense for the central bank toerr on the side of fighting inflation in January and February wheninflationary pressures were higher.   But he said current signals show that the economy is slowing to amore sustainable pace with inflation abating.   Analysts said the May unemployment report, released last Friday,probably provided the final bit of evidence the central bank neededto decide that it could begin loosening its credit grip. Theunemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, but it was accompanied by theweakest advance in job growth in three years.   There were published reports last week that the Fed'spolicy-making Open Market Committee, composed of the seven Fedgovernors in Washington and five of the 12 regional Fed bankpresidents, was split on the question of lowering interest rates andunable to come to a policy decision during two telephone conferencecalls.   Former Fed governor Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the MortgageBankers Association, said the Fed may have held another telephoneconference call in recent days and decided to take a cautious firststep toward easing.   But he said financial markets would be wrong to expect any quickand dramatic moves to ease credit, such as a cut in the discountrate, the interest the Fed charges to loan money to financialinstitutions.   ``I think the Fed will be cautious because we are not entirelycertain that our inflation problem is behind us,'' Gramley said.</TEXT></DOC>
