The aerospace and data-systems concern said Southern New England Telephone, a New Haven, Conn.-based independent phone company serving most of Connecticut, is an important addition to its team because of the substantial number of federal facilities in Connecticut.    However, a Martin Marietta spokesman said the agreement isn't exclusive, meaning Southern New England Telephone is free to join other teams bidding on the contract.    As previously reported, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which currently is prime contractor on the government's phone network, is teaming with Boeing Co. to bid on the new contract. The General Services Administration has asked for bids to be submitted by June, and the agency hopes to award the contract by the end of the year.    The new system, which is scheduled to be put into service by mid-1990, will provide voice, video and data services.    Martin Marietta's team includes MCI Communications Corp., the Northern Telecom Inc. unit of Northern Telecom Ltd., and units of the seven regional Bell operating companies spun off from ATandamp;T in 1984. </TEXT></DOC>
