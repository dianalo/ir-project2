The      breakout cable is connected between the vehicle electronic control module      and the vehicle sensors and controls. Resistance measurements are made      between a selected pair of connector pins of the breakout cable by      connecting a current loop (which includes a power supply and a known      resistance) through a first multiplexing circuit to the selected pair of      pins. A voltage measuring circuit measures voltage across the known      resistance and between the pair of pins. The voltage measuring circuit      includes a second multiplexing circuit and a voltmeter. The second      multiplexing circuit receives inputs from the various pins, as well as      from opposite sides of the known resistance in the current loop. The      second multiplexing circuit provides its output to the voltmeter for      measurement. By measuring the voltage across the known resistance, and the      voltage between the selected pair of pins, the resistance between the two      pins can be derived. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to an automated automotive test system. In      particular, the present invention is an automated breakout box for      performing test sequences on electrical systems of an automotive vehicle      which include voltage and resistance measurements. </PAR><PAR>  With the advent of integrated circuits, and with the increasing use of      sophisticated electronic, electric and electromechanical sensors and      control systems in automobiles, the testing and servicing of automobiles      has presented ever-increasing challenges. At the present time, many tests      of electrical systems, sensors and components of an automobile are made      manually by a technician who unplugs a multipin connector between the      vehicle's electronic control module (ECM) and the vehicle sensors and      controls. The technician makes voltage and resistance measurements between      various pins of the connector using a multimeter. The technician making      those measurements is required to move the multimeter probe to appropriate      measurement points. It is also necessary to set the multimeter to the      proper measuring formula, such as volts or ohms. </PAR><PAR>  This manual testing procedure has many drawbacks. In particular, the      technician must follow detailed instructions in order to perform the      proper tests. The instructions require that the technician set the proper      condition, select the proper test points, read the equipment properly, and      compare the reading to the listed tolerances specified in the      instructions. </PAR><PAR>  Some test systems have been developed which simplify some of the test      operations. These devices use selection switches to select the proper test      points. While this helps to some extent, the technician is still required      to use the instructions, set the multimeter, and compare readings to the      listed tolerances for that measurement. </PAR><PAR>  The Ballou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,463 describes a computerized      automotive vehicle diagnostic system in which a multiconductor probe cable      is connected between the ECM and the vehicle sensors and controls. This      cable is connected to a programmable cross-point switch, which is      controlled by a microcontroller. The cross-point switch is controlled to      connect a multimeter, a voltage source and a ground selectively to points      in order to perform a sequence of tests. These can include reading      resistance, reading voltage, reading a pulse width modulated signal and      reading the time in between two pulses. </PAR><PAR>  As the number of electrical systems and sensors increase, the number of      possible combinations of points which need testing increases as well. An      automated breakout box, therefore, would preferably make use of solid      state switching devices to make connections between the testing circuitry      and the points to be tested. Solid state multiplexers are available which      are capable of selecting among a large number of different inputs or      outputs. A solid state multiplexer offers significant advantages in size,      cost and reliability over a multiplexer which makes use of      electromechanical relays. </PAR><PAR>  The problem with solid state multiplexers, however, is the internal      resistance of the multiplexers in the ON state--which can typically be 75      ohms, and which varies with temperature, humidity, and other factors. In      comparison, the contact resistance in electromechanical relay is much      less, and is not affected to the same extent by temperature or humidity. </PAR><PAR>  In certain applications, the internal resistance of solid state      multiplexers is not a factor. For example, in reading voltages, solid      state multiplexers do not introduce a significant error, because the      voltage measuring devices require high impedance input circuits (typically      10 megohms input impedance), and therefore the internal resistance of the      multiplexers does not affect accuracy of a voltage reading. This is not      the case, however, in measuring resistances of the type encountered in the      typical automobile. Often, the internal resistance of a solid state      multiplexer is much greater than the resistance to be measured. Measuring      resistance of vehicle sensors and other control components requires the      ability to make very precise resistance readings down to very low values      (on the order of a few ohms). These readings must also be made at low      current levels, so that the test current being used does not damage the      circuitry or components during the testing procedure. </PAR><PAR>  The use of relays in a multiplexer overcomes the problem of internal      resistance, but has other disadvantages. For example, with a 60-channel      multiplexer (i.e., which is required to make measurements between 60 pairs      of contact points), a minimum of 120 relays is required. The resulting      multiplexer is bulky, costly and not as reliable as solid state      multiplexers. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention uses a first pair of multiplexers to connect a power      supply and reference resistor to a selected pair of connector points, and      a second pair of multiplexers to connect a voltage measuring circuit to      the two connection points and to opposite sides of the reference resistor.      By using separate multiplexers for the current supply circuit and the      voltage measuring circuit, the effects of internal resistance of the      multiplexers connected to the power supply is not a factor in the      measurement of resistance. The present invention, therefore, allows solid      state multiplexers to be used, rather than electromechanical relays,      without affecting the accuracy of resistance measurements. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an electrical block diagram of an automated breakout box of the      present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an electrical block diagram of the analog processing and control      circuitry of the automated breakout box of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a simplified block diagram illustrating the resistance      measurement circuitry of the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows automated breakout box 10 of the present invention, which      includes digital computer 2, control and analog processing circuitry 14,      power supply 16, memory 18, vehicle scanner 20, user input/output 22      (which includes keyboard 22A and display 22B), and external communication      circuitry 24. Automated breakout box 10 is connected to an automobile      through control and analog processing circuitry 14, and performs      sequential testing of a variety of different systems and components, such      as the electronic control module (ECM) and related vehicle sensors and      controls, the fuel injection system, instrument panel displays and      indicators, and the anti-lock braking system (ABS). Under the control of      computer 12, automated breakout box 10 sets up the conditions for testing,      does the test, records the test results, and supplies the test results to      the operator/technician through the user display 22B to permit the results      of the test to be reviewed. </PAR><PAR>  Computer 12 is preferably a microprocessor-based computer system. Computer      12 provides control signals to control and analog processing circuitry 14      to set up circuitry 14 to make particular tests. In preferred embodiments      of the present invention, circuitry 14 measures voltages, resistances, and      pulse widths, and provides to computer 12 digital data which represents      the measured values. As will be described in further detail with reference      to FIGS. 2 and 3, control and analog processing circuitry 14 is capable of      connection to the electrical system of an automobile, and can measure      voltages and resistance between a large number of individual connector      points. </PAR><PAR>  Power supply 16 provides power to computer 12 and to memory 18. </PAR><PAR>  Memory 18 preferably includes RAM, ROM, and EPROM storage for use by      computer 12. The programs which operate computer 12 can be stored in      memory 18. In addition, the specifications of the particular vehicle to be      tested, including the particular pins to be accessed and the sequence of      tests to be performed, is provided to computer 12 from memory 18. This      allows the test to proceed automatically, without a need for the      technician to read and follow a lengthy procedure in a printed manual.      Because there are a large number of different vehicles, each with a unique      set of connectors and test sequences, memory 18 preferably includes      storage devices such as memory cards, memory cartridges, magnetic floppy      disks, optical disks, or the like, which store all of the necessary      information for a particular vehicle. Depending on the vehicle to be used,      a selected storage device for that vehicle is inserted into memory 18,      which includes an appropriate card reader, cartridge reader, disk drive or      the like. </PAR><PAR>  Vehicle scanner 20 is a device which can connect to a readout plug on a      vehicle to obtain fault code information from the vehicle. For General      Motors cars, the connector for fault code information is known as the ALDL      connector. The fault code obtained by vehicle scanner 20 is supplied to      computer 12, and is used to direct the testing to particular systems and      components and to particular test sequences. </PAR><PAR>  User I/O 22 preferably includes keyboard 22A and display 22B. The      operator/technician provides information about the particular vehicle to      be tested and the tests which are desired, and responds to prompts from      computer 12 which are supplied to the display 22B. </PAR><PAR>  As part of the automated testing procedure, information is supplied through      display 22B to the operator/technician, indicating the test conditions      which must be set. For example, in some tests the vehicle's ignition must      be on, while in another test the ignition must be off. Similarly, some      tests require that devices be moved (such as rotating the throttle plate      to see if the resistance values are in the right range). Other tests      require that the engine be running. Display 22B, under the control of      computer 12, provides the necessary prompts and setup information to the      operator/technician. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, display 22B provides the operator/technician with the results      of the test such as the test sequence number, the value read, the      tolerance required by that particular test, and good or bad indication. </PAR><PAR>  External communication circuitry 24 allows computer 12 to communicate with      other computers and systems. In one preferred embodiment, external      communication circuitry 24 includes CAN and RS232 communication      capabilities. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows control and analog processing circuitry 14, which is used to      make voltage and resistance measurements and to measure pulse width. In      FIG. 2, vehicle ECM 30 and vehicle sensors and controls 32 are shown.      Connection to ECM 30 and to vehicle sensors and controls 32 is made by      breakout cable 34, which includes multipin connector 36 for connection to      ECM 30, multipin connector 38 for connection to sensors and controls 32,      and multipin connector 40 for connection to adaptor 42. The particular      configuration of connector pins for vehicle ECM 30 and vehicle sensors and      controls 32 will differ depending upon the manufacturer and in some cases      the model of vehicle. Breakout cable 34 is one of several different cables      available to the technician, and is arranged to mate with a particular      manufacturer's ECM 30 and sensors and controls 32. </PAR><PAR>  Adaptor 42 provides a connection between connector 40 of breakout cable 34      and universal multipin connector 44 of circuitry 14. The      operator/technician has available a number of different breakout cables 34      and adaptors 42 to allow circuitry 14 to be used with a variety of      different manufacturers' vehicles </PAR><PAR>  Universal connector 44 mates with adaptor 42, and provides the connection      between the test circuits of control and analog processing circuitry 14      and the electrical system or component which is being tested. In one      preferred embodiment of the present invention, universal connector 44 is a      120-pin connector which has a separate ground wire 46 and allegator clamp      48 for connection to vehicle ground. </PAR><PAR>  Connected to universal connector 44 is resistance measuring current supply      circuit 50 and voltage measuring circuit 52. Control and analog processing      circuitry 14 also includes flying lead circuitry 54, which allows      measurement between any two points independent of universal connector 44. </PAR><PAR>  Current supply circuitry 50 includes power supply 56, precision resistors      R1 and R2, relay contact 58A and relay coil 58B, multiplexers 70 and 72      and interface 74. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a      power supply 56 is a constant current power supply which operates at about      10 volts and supplies a 10 milliamp constant current. Multiplexers 70 and      72 are 64:1 multiplexers. </PAR><PAR>  The current Iandplus; from terminal 76 of power supply 56 is supplied to input 70A      of multiplexer 70. Based upon a control signal from interface 74,      multiplexer 70 supplies current Iandplus; to one of its outputs, which include      sixty output lines 70B which are connected to connector 44 and output line      70C which is connected to flying lead circuitry 54. When cable 34 is being      used, this causes current Iandplus; to be steered to one of sixty different      connection points through connector 44, adaptor 42, and cable 34. Return      current I- from vehicle sensors and controls 32 is supplied through      breakout cable 34 and connector 40 to adaptor 42 and then to universal      connector 44. It is returned on one of sixty input lines 72A to      multiplexer 72. Alternatively, return current is returned on input line      72B from flying lead circuit 54. Interface 74 supplies a signal to      multiplexer 72 which selects one of the input lines 72A, 72B, and routes      the return current I- through output line 72C to resistor R2. The return      current I- flows through resistor R2 and through either resistor R1 or      relay contacts 54, depending on whether shunt relay coil 58B is energized      or de-energized. The return current I- then flows to terminal 78 of power      supply 56. </PAR><PAR>  Interface 74 receives signals from computer 12 and selects the particular      connector to which and from which current is supplied by the resistance      measuring current loop. Interface 74 also selects the range of operation      by selecting whether resistor R1 will be connected in series with resistor      R2 or will be shunted by relay contacts 58A. In one preferred embodiment      of the present invention, R1 is a 100 K ohm resistor, while resistor R2 is      a 200 ohm resistor. </PAR><PAR>  Voltage measuring circuit 52 includes electrostatic discharge (ESD)      protection and scaling circuitry 80, multiplexers 82 and 84, operational      amplifier 86, sample/hold and peak-to-peak detector circuit 88,      auto-ranging circuitry 90, analog-to-digital (A/D) convertor 92, pulse      width timer 94, and interface circuit 96. </PAR><PAR>  Multiplexers 82 and 84 are 64:1 multiplexers which receive a plurality of      input lines, and provide one output line each. Sixty input lines 82A to      multiplexer 82 are supplied through ESD protection and scaling circuit 80.      These sixty input lines 82A are connected to the same sixty pins of      connector 44 as output lines 70B of multiplexer 70. In addition,      multiplexer 82 receives input line 82B, which is connected to terminal 78      of power supply 56. The VA output of flying lead circuitry 54 (which will      be described in further detail later) is also supplied on input line 82C      to multiplexer 82. Vehicle ground line 100 (which is connected to ground      wire 46 and allegator clamp 48) is supplied as an input to multiplexer 82      and multiplexer 84. </PAR><PAR>  Multiplexer 84 receives sixty input lines 84A from ESD protection and      scaling circuit 80 which are connected to the same sixty pins of connector      44 as input lines 72A of multiplexer 72. </PAR><PAR>  Multiplexer 84 also receives input line 84B which is connected to output      line 72C of multiplexer 72. It also receives the VB output from flying      lead circuitry 54 on input line 84C. </PAR><PAR>  Multiplexers 82 and 84 are controlled by interface 96, which receives      control signals from computer 12. Interface 96 also supplies control      signals which determine whether A/D convertor 92 or pulse width timer 94      will be supplying data on lines 104. </PAR><PAR>  Output lines 82D and 84D of multiplexers 82 and 84 are connected to the      inverting (-) and non-inverting (andplus;) inputs of operational amplifier 86,      respectively. The output of operational amplifier 86 is supplied to both      sample/hold and peak-to-peak detector circuit 88 and also to pulse width      timer 94. The output of sample/hold and peak-to-peak detector circuit 88      is supplied to the auto-ranging circuitry 90 of A/D convertor 92. When A/D      convertor 92 is selected by interface 96, it converts the analog voltage      which receives at its input to a 12-bit digital value which is supplied on      lines 104. </PAR><PAR>  Pulse width timer 94, when selected by interface 96, receives the output of      operational amplifier 86 and times the pulse width of the signal received.      The measured pulse width is supplied as digital data on lines 104 to      computer 12. </PAR><PAR>  Flying lead circuitry 54 includes flying lead interface 110, connector 112,      and a pair of probes 114 and 116. Function generator 118 is also connected      to flying lead interface 110. </PAR><PAR>  Interface 74 provides a general purpose control line 120 which selects      operation through flying lead circuit 54, rather than through breakout      cable 34, adaptor 42, and universal connector 44. When selected, flying      leads probes 114 and 116 are used to contact selected leads or pins.      Various voltage and resistance measurements can be made which are similar      to the measurements made through cable 34. Resistance measurements current      is provided to and from flying lead interface 110 through lines 70C and      72B which are connected to multiplexers 70 and 72, together with voltage      output lines 126 and 128 which supply the VA and VB output voltages to      multiplexers 82 and 84. </PAR><PAR>  Voltage measurements are made by circuit 14 through the use of voltage      measuring circuitry 52. Computer 12 selects, through interface 96, the two      connector points of universal connector 44 which are to be connected to      A/D convertor 92. This selection is done through multiplexers 82 and 84.      The output voltages from multiplexers 82 and 84 are supplied on lines 82D      and 84D to operational amplifier 86, and through sample/hold and      peak-to-peak detector circuitry 88 and auto-ranging circuitry 90 to the      input of A/D convertor 92. </PAR><PAR>  If additional voltages are to be measured, computer 12 changes the control      signals supplied to interface 96, which causes multiplexers 82 and 84 to      select other pins for connection to operational amplifier 86. </PAR><PAR>  The same voltage measurements can be made through flying lead circuit 54.      Interface 74 provides a control signal on line 120 to flying lead      interface 110. The VA and VB voltages supplied on input lines 82C and 84C      of multiplexers 82 and 84, and are connected to output lines 82D and 84D      and thus to the inputs of operational amplifier 86. </PAR><PAR>  When resistance measurements are to be made, both current supply circuit 50      and voltage measuring circuit 52 are active. Normally, breakout cable 34      will be connected only to vehicle sensors and controls 32 during a      resistance measurement test. This avoids having a component within the      vehicle ECM affecting the resistance measurement. During a voltage      measurement, on the other hand, both ECM 30 and vehicle sensors and      controls 32 are normally connected to breakout cable 34. </PAR><PAR>  Power supply 56, which is preferably a constant current source providing      current at a level of about 10 milliamps and nominally about 10 volts,      supplies current Iandplus; through multiplexer 70 to one of the sixty lines 70B      to connector 44. The return current I-  is supplied from connector 44 to      one of the sixty input lines 72A of multiplexer 72, and then from output      line 72C through one or both the resistors R1 and R2. Computer 12 selects,      through interface 74 and shunt relay coil 58B, whether resistor R1 will be      shunted by contacts 58A. </PAR><PAR>  When the resistance measuring mode is first selected, multiplexers 82 and      84 are controlled to connect the selected two pins of connector 44 to the      inputs of operational amplifier 86. Al this time, current is not yet being      supplied through multiplexers 70 and 72, and therefore no voltage should      appear between the andplus; and - inputs of operational amplifier 86. If a      voltage does appear, the data on lines 104 to computer 12 will indicate      the presence of the non-zero voltage, and computer 12 will stop and      provide a message through display 22B. Computer 12 will not allow a      resistance measurement to continue until the operator/technician supplies      an input through keyboard 22A indicating that the condition has been      corrected. Typically, this situation will occur because ECM 30 has not      been disconnected from breakout cable 34. </PAR><PAR>  If no voltage appeared on the selected pins, computer 12 will instruct      multiplexers 70 and 72 to select the same two pins which are selected by      multiplexers 82 and 84. Circuitry 14 is then ready to perform the      resistance check. </PAR><PAR>  Multiplexers 82 and 84 are instructed to set measuring points to lines 82B      and 84B. The voltage reading between these two lines represents the      voltage across resistors R1 and R2. Since the resistance between lines 82B      and 84B is known (i.e., either R1andplus;R2 of just R2), the voltage reading      which is obtained provides an indication of the current which is flowing      through the current loop. </PAR><PAR>  Computer 12 then instructs multiplexers 82 and 84 to read the voltage      across the pre-selected pins. Since the current was known by the previous      measurement, computer 12 is able to derive the resistance by measuring the      voltage between the two pins and dividing that voltage by the current      which had just been read. </PAR><PAR>  This method allows the reading of very small resistances very accurately.      The internal resistances of multiplexers 70, 72, 82 and 84 do not affect      the accuracy of the measurement. As a result, the present invention allows      the use of solid state multiplexers which are substantially lower cost,      more reliable, and more compact than relays. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows a simplified version of the resistance measurement circuitry      shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 3, digital voltmeter 150 represents the circuitry      formed by operational amplifier 86, sample/hold and peak-to-peak detector      circuitry 88, auto-ranging circuitry 90, and A/D convertor 92. In      addition, the diagram is simplified by not showing breakout cable 34,      adaptor 42, universal connector 44 and flying lead circuitry 54. The      resistance to be measured is referred to R.sub.x, the voltage across      resistors R1 and R2 is E.sub.s, and the voltage across resistor R.sub.x is      E.sub.x. </PAR><PAR>  During the first measurement, the voltage E.sub.s is read by digital      voltmeter 150 through multiplexers 82 and 84. The current I.sub.x is:      ##EQU1## </PAR><PAR>  In the next step of the process, digital voltmeter 150 reads voltage      E.sub.x. Since I.sub.x is already known and E.sub.x is measured,      resistance R.sub.x can be determined by:      ##EQU2## </PAR><PAR>  The internal resistances of multiplexers 70 and 72 are not involved in      these readings. E.sub.x is measured directly across resistors Rl and R2,      and E.sub.x is measured directly across R.sub.x. Multiplexers 70 and 72      simply steer the current I.sub.x to and from resistor R.sub.x, but are not      involved in the voltage measurements from which resistance R.sub.x is      derived. </PAR><PAR>  The internal resistances of multiplexers 82 and 84 also do not affect the      voltage readings because those resistances (approximately 75 ohms) are      very small compared to the high input impedance (typically 10 megohms) of      digital voltmeter 150. </PAR><PAR>  The resistance measuring technique of the present invention offers another      unique capability for breakout box 10. It is possible, with the present      invention, to measure cross-talk between various lines and sensors. This      can be done by supplying current through multiplexers 70 and 72 to one set      of pins, and then measuring voltages through multiplexers 82 and 84 on      different sets of pins. </PAR><PAR>  Although the present invention has been described with reference to      preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that      changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit      and scope of the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
