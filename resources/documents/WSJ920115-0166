The arrest Monday night of a senior political ally onbribery charges means that Mr. Miyazawa will be back in thehot seat when Japan's legislature convenes later this month.And there may be more to come: Tokyo's battered stock markethas been roiled in recent days by reports that a potentiallybigger scandal -- this one allegedly involving gangsters, aswell as politicians -- is about to erupt.</LP><TEXT>   For Mr. Miyazawa, who got off to a shaky start as primeminister in the last two months of 1991, these are ominousdevelopments.   Mr. Miyazawa and aides rejected suggestions that some ofthe bribes allegedly taken by Fumio Abe, a senior member ofMr. Miyazawa's political party faction, may have found theirway into the faction's campaign chest. But opposition partiesare pledging to pursue that question in the Diet session thatstarts Jan. 24. The opposition also promises to leave nostone unturned when it resumes an inquiry, suspended at theend of the last session, into Mr. Miyazawa's connection tothe Recruit influence-peddling scandal of the late 1980s. Thefresh whiff of scandal might also give the opposition anexcuse to bottle up budget legislation for the fiscal yearthat begins April 1.   Messy scandals and stalled legislation would damage theruling Liberal Democratic Party's prospects in Upper Houseelections scheduled for mid-year. Heavy losses in thechamber, where the LDP already is short of a majority, couldmean an early end to Mr. Miyazawa's term as party head andprime minister. Analysts were already predicting seriousproblems for Mr. Miyazawa, following his failure to winpassage of a bill that would have permitted Japanese troopsto participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations.   Newspaper editorials yesterday argued that Mr. Abe'salleged acceptance of 80 million yen ($629,680) in bribesfrom a steel-products maker is further evidence that Japan'spolitical system needs to be cleaned up. The daily YomiuriShimbun noted that the latest case brings the number of majorcorruption cases involving Diet members to 15 since World WarII.   Japanese newspapers reported that Mr. Abe is alleged tohave used his post as director-general of the HokkaidoDevelopment Agency to help Kyowa Corp., a now-bankrupt steelcompany, win construction projects in Hokkaido, Japan'snorthernmost island. Mr. Abe denied the allegations duringquestioning by prosecutors yesterday, according to NHK,Japan's public broadcasting company.   Meanwhile, another long-rumored scandal is heating up.Major Japanese newspapers in the past two weeks have reportedthat executives of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a package deliveryservice with alleged underworld connections, may have madehuge political contributions to scores of politicians. Someaccounts said the company sought political help in winningpermits needed to expand its business. The company isreported to be under investigation by law enforcementauthorities.   A Tokyo police spokesman declined to comment on reportsthat Tokyo Sagawa had filed a complaint against two formerexecutives for breach of trust, in connection with loansallegedly funneled to gangster-affiliated businesses. Aspokeswoman for Tokyo Sagawa said no one who could comment onthe reports was available.   Mr. Miyazawa took office last year after Prime MinisterToshiki Kaifu failed to win Diet approval for a package ofreform bills that would have reshaped the electoral systemand reduced the importance of money in political campaigns.The proposals were resisted by opposition parties and manyLDP members, who feared the changes would endanger theirseats.   Mr. Miyazawa has pledged to push for passage of a revisedpolitical-reform package. But he will first have to answerlingering questions about his own connection to the Recruitscandal, in which many senior politicians receivedbargain-priced shares in an unlisted affiliate of RecruitCo., an information-services concern. Opposition politicianscontend that documents submitted by Mr. Miyazawa to the Dietlast month suggest that he may have known more about theRecruit scandal than he has acknowledged. The scandalprompted Mr. Miyazawa's resignation as finance minister inlate 1988, after it was learned that one of his aides tradedin the shares. Mr. Miyazawa maintains that the aide acted onhis own.</TEXT></DOC>
