CMS said that with the addition of Panhandle's Source Cogeneration Co. to the project, the venture now has about $290 million of the $420 million in third-party investments needed to undertake the plant conversion. William T. McCormick Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of CMS, said CMS is negotiating with two other companies to invest in the project.    Others that have joined Midland Cogeneration Venture are Midland, Mich.-based Dow Chemical Co., Baden, Switzerland-based Brown, Boveri andamp; Co. and Irvine, Calif.-based Fluor Corp. Consumers Power is putting up the plant, valued at $1.5 billion, in return for a 49% stake in the venture, and $1.2 billion in notes.    The Midland, Mich., plant, which was abandoned because of escalated cost and production delays, will supply steam and electricity to Dow and Consumers Power's electric customers in Michigan, beginning in 1990.    CMS said Midland Cogeneration also entered into gas-transportation agreements with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. and Trunkline Gas Co., interstate pipeline units of Houston-based Panhandle Eastern. Consumers Power also signed new 10-year contracts with the pipeline units for sales and transportation services, replacing and extending contracts now in effect.    &quot;The renegotiated contracts will allow Consumers Power to better match future supplies with demand, and in the near term, reduce gas costs to our customers,&quot; Mr. McCormick said. </TEXT></DOC>
