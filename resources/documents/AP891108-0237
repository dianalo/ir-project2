The six were sentenced to death at a public rally on Tuesday andwere immediately executed, said the official of the Foreign AffairsOffice in Chengdu, capital of southwestern Sichuan province.Executions in China are usually by a bullet to the back of the head.   He said three were charged with ``beating, smashing, looting andburning'' during the June 4-6 riots in Chengdu and three with theftand murder.   At least 12 others, including two in Chengdu, were executedpreviously for direct involvement in anti-government demonstrationsand riots that wracked the nation this spring.   The previous 12 were all non-students. It was not clear whetherany students were among the six executed in Chengdu this week.   The national press now rarely reports on arrests or court casesinvolving participants in the student-led pro-democracy movement.Reports that student leaders and soldiers who refused to cooperatein the military crackdown in Beijing have been put to death cannotbe confirmed.   Police attempts to break up a student sit-in on June 4 led tothree days of rioting in Chengdu, with estimates of 30 deaths. Awhole city block, including a large department store, was engulfedin flames in the most serious outbreak of violence in any cityoutside Beijing.</TEXT></DOC>
