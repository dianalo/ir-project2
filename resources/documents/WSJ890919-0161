Under the accord, creditor banks of the troubled West German retailer agreed to a proposal by Deutsche Genossenschafts Bank, under which the banks will forgive 75% of Co op's debt of 2.7 billion marks ($1.37 billion) and DG Bank will take over all shares in the Frankfurt concern, said Co op's chief spokesman.    &quot;Debt forgiveness was declared, the full concept was accepted, so the state of overindebtedness no longer exists,&quot; the spokesman said.    But not all Co op's creditors agreed to the rescue plan. &quot;We have sufficient support, but it is not 100%,&quot; a spokesman for DG Bank said. Bankers and company officials will try to win the support of banks that rejected the plan, he said.    The bailout plan also calls for a reduction in the nominal value of the shares, followed by a sale of shares to raise funds. </TEXT></DOC>
