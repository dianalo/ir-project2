RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court ruled today that publicofficials may not be sued when their alleged gross negligencepermits a child to be abused by a parent.   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a state does not have aconstitutional duty to protect people, including abused children,who are not in the state's custody.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said,``As a general matter...we conclude that a state's failure toprotect an individual against private violence simply does notconstitute a violation of the (Constitution's) due process clause.''   In other matters taken up today:   _ The court ruled that states may not prohibit political partyleaders from endorsing primary election candidates. The justices, byan 8-0 vote, struck down a California law as an impermissibleinfringement of constitutionally protected freedom of speech. Thecourt also struck down as unconstitutional California laws limitingthe term of office for party leaders and dictating the make-up ofstate party central committees.   _ The justices sidestepped deciding whether a criminaldefendant's right to be tried by his peers is violated whenprosecutors disqualify potential jurors based on their race. By a7-2 vote, the justices ruled against Frank D. Teague, sentenced to30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Chicago supermarketand for the attempted murder of police officers shot after therobbery. Four justices _ one vote short of the majority needed toset binding legal precedent _ said Teague should not be allowed toraise the representative-jury issue.   _ The court, in a victory for the federal government, made iteasier for some creditors to collect more money from those whodeclare bankruptcy. The court, by a 5-4 ruling in a case fromDetroit, said the government is entitled to certain interestpayments on taxes owed by a bankrupt company.   In the child-abuse case, the court rejected an appeal on behalfof a Wisconsin boy, Joshua DeShaney, who since age 4 has beenseriously and permanently brain damaged from beatings by his father.   In an unusual emotional dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmunexclaimed, ``Poor Joshua! It is a sad commentary upon American lifeand constitutional principles...that this child, Joshua DeShaney,now is assigned to live out the remainder of his life profoundlyretarded'' and without an opportunity to sue the state.   Social workers were accused of violating Joshua's constitutionalrights by failing to come to his rescue after they had repeatedevidence he was being beaten.   But Rehnquist said the state's awareness of the boy's plight doesnot mean it has a duty to protect him.   Only ``when the state takes a person into its custody and holdshim there against his will'' does the Constitution require officialsto take responsibility for the individual's safety and well-being,Rehnquist said.   ``While the state may have been aware of the dangers that Joshuafaced in the free world, it played no part in their creation nor didit do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them,'' he said.   Nor does the fact that the boy was once in the state's custodychange the situation, the chief justice added. ``The state does notbecome the permanent guarantor of an individual's safety by havingonce offered him shelter,'' he said.   Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, John PaulStevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall joined Blackmun indissent.   A suit in Joshua's behalf was filed against the Winnebago County,Wis., Department of Social Services and two of its employees.   The boy first came to the attention of the welfare agency when hewas brought to a hospital in 1983 with cuts and bruises.   The girlfriend of Joshua's father said the boy was injured in anattack by another child.   Officials suspected he was being abused by adults and a socialworker, Ann Kenmeter, was assigned to the case.   Joshua was returned to the custody of his father, Randy DeShaney,with a recommendation that DeShaney's girlfriend move out of thehouse because DeShaney had hinted she might be abusing the boy.   DeShaney's former wife and Joshua's mother, Melody DeShaney, wasliving in Cheyenne, Wyo., where the couple had been divorced.   A month after the first hospital visit, Joshua again was treatedfor suspicious injuries.   Ms. Kenmeter visited the DeShaney home on several occasions andnoticed bumps on Johsua's head. The boy also was treated again at ahospital for various bruises and injuries. Also, DeShaney'sgirlfriend still was living at the home.   Ms. Kenmeter visited the DeShaney home on March 7, 1984, and wastold that several days earlier Joshua had fainted in the bathroomfor no apparent reason. But according to court records, the socialworker did not ask to see the boy.   The following day Joshua was treated at a hospital for headinjuries that destroyed half his brain, leaving him profoundlyretarded and institutionalized for the rest of his life.   The boy's father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced totwo to four years in prison.   The county social services department and its employees were suedby Joshua's mother on grounds the boy was deprived of libertywithout due process.   Today's Supreme Court ruling upheld a federal appeals courtdecision that threw out the suit.   The case is DeShaney vs. Winnebago County, 87-154.</TEXT></DOC>
