The estimated marginof sales at less than fair value is 56.26 percent <T3>ad valorem,</T3> as shown in the ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation''section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>On November 14, 1988, we made an affirmative preliminary determinationin this case (53 FR 46898_November 21, 1988). The following events haveoccurred since the publication of that notice.On November 18, 1988, in response to our deficiency letter of October 26,1988, we received a revised response from Laminfer S.A. (``Laminfer'')of Rosario, Argentina, which accounted for virtually all exports of thesubject merchandise to the United States from Argentina during the periodof investigation. On December 1, 1988, we received a request from counselfor Laminfer to participate in the hearing scheduled for January 4, 1989.On December 7, 1988, less than a week before the verification, Laminfersubmitted a completely revised response, supplemented a day later by asubmission on advertising expenses incurred in the home market. We verifiedthe responses submitted by Laminfer from December 12 to December 17, 1988,in Rosario. On December 27, 1988, counsel for Laminfer withdrew its requestto participate in the hearing. With the agreement of the petitioners, wecancelled the hearing schedule for January 4, 1989.On December 28, 1988, we received a revised response from Laminfer as aresult of our findings at verification. On January 4, 1989, we receivedinitial briefs from petitioners and respondent. The same day, counsel forLaminfer requested that we postpone the date of the final determinationuntil not later than 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminarydetermination, pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act. On January6, 1989, we issued a notice postponing the final determination until March31, 1989 (54 FR 1199_January 12, 1989). We received written comments frompetitioners and respondent with respect to the verification on March 20,1989, and rebuttal briefs from both parties on March 22, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted from the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States, Annotated</T3> (TSUSA) to the<T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS), as provided for in section 1201<T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,on or after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s). As with the TSUSA numbers, the HTS numbers are providedfor convenience and customs purposes. The written product description remainsdispositive.The product covered by this investigation consists of light-walled weldedcarbon steel pipes and tubes of rectangular (including square) cross-section,having a wall thickness of less than 0.156 inch, currently classifiableunder item number 7306.60.50.00 of the HTS.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>The period of investigation for LWRT from Argentina extends from January1, 1988 through June 30, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair-Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether the sales of the subject merchandise in the UnitedStates were made at less than fair value, we compared the United Statesprice with the foreign market value as specified below.For the reasons cited below, we have determined, in accordance with section776(c) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1677e(c)), that use of the best informationotherwise available (BIA) is appropriate in this case. This statutory provisionrequires the Department to use BIA ``whenever a party or any other personrefuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manneror in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation.''Subsequent to our preliminary determination in this case, and less thana week before verification, Laminfer submitted on December 7, 1988, a revisedresponse supplementing and correcting its earlier submissions. In additionto correcting obvious clerical errors and reformatting the tapes in a moreconsistent and computer-readable manner than was previously the case, Laminfer'sDecember 7 submission contained changes in product matches and correctionsto the finishes, the dimensions, the weights, and the dates of sale forboth home-market and U.S. sales.At the outset of the verification the following week, Laminfer submittedto the Department's case analysts on site in Argentina a completely newlisting of U.S. sales replacing that submitted on December 7, 1988. ByLaminfer's own admission, this substitution was motivated by the fact thatthe dates of sale and the sale prices reported in the December 7 responsewere in error, which caused Laminfer to report certain sales that wereoutside the period of investigation.As the verification proceeded, the Department's case analysts discoveredthat Laminfer mistakenly had not reported all sales of such or similarmerchandise in the home market, as required by the questionnaire pursuantto section 773(a) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1677b(a)). Instead, acting on itsbelief that round tubing sold in the home market was most similar to themerchandise sold in the United States, Laminfer had reported home-marketsales consisting almost exclusively of round tubing, leaving a considerablenumber of sales of rectangular (including square) tubing unreported. Laminferthen submitted at the verification site a new listing of home-market salesof rectangular (including square) tubing and asked that it be verified.The case analysts verified this new information after warning Laminferthat the Department was not likely to accept such a massive revision thislate in an investigation.As a result of this delay in the verification process, a number of deductionsand adjustments claimed by Laminfer were either not verified (theoreticalversus actual weight, foreign inland insurance, sales commissions in theUnited States, home-market packing, inventory carrying costs, and bad debt)or were only partially verified. For example, Laminfer withdrew its claimthat an adjustment be made to allow for physical differences in the merchandisesold in Argentina and the United States, which was no longer valid sincethe adjustment had been calculated on the basis of comparisons betweenround tubing sold in the home market and rectangular (including square)tubing sold in the United States, and reintroduced the previously calculateddifferences in merchandise as an adjustment to allow for differences inquantities sold in both markets. At verification, Laminfer documented onlyone of the sixty monthly difference-in-merchandise/difference-in-quantityadjustments it claimed, an adjustment which it selected itself and whichhad already been elaborated on in the response. As time had run out becauseof Laminfer's own delays and mistakes, the Commerce analysts were unableto select at random other products and other months to verify, which theynormally would have done.Subsequent to the verification, on December 28, 1988, three months afterthe original questionnaire response was due and a month and a half afterour preliminary determination, Laminfer submitted to the Department yetanother revised response that incorporated all the changes mentioned above.While the Department allows minor revisions to questionnaire responsesafter the preliminary determination and during verification, it is well-establishedDepartment policy not to accept new responses after the preliminary determinationbecause at that point in an investigation there is insufficient time forthe Department to analyze and verify properly the new information. Hadwe accepted this information for use in this determination, we would havebeen required to analyze, among other things, Laminfer's new product matches,costs relating to difference-in-quantity adjustments, and new U.S. andhome-market sales data within the strict statutory deadlines of the investigation.The untimely submission of key information only days before, during, andafter the verification precluded the Department from conducting a reasonableand thorough analysis of this information prior to the verification, justas petitioners were unable to comment on the new responses. Because therecalculations and revisions carried out at verification substantiallyexceeded any methodological problems and mathematical errors that are commonlyfound, the Department cannot properly base its determination on the informationsubmitted during and after verification by the respondent. It is the responsibilityof respondents to provide an accurate and complete response prior to thepreliminary determination and verification so that the Department may fullyanalyze the response and other parties may comment on it. The purpose ofverification is to establish the accuracy of a response rather than toreconstruct the information to fit the requirements of the Department (<T3>see Chinsung </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip op. 89-15 (Court of International Trade_February7, 1989)). For these reasons, we have disregarded all of Laminfer's responsesfor purposes of this final determination. Accordingly, we used the informationin the petition as BIA for purposes of this final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>Since we did not have specific data as to the quantities and prices ofthe subject merchandise sold in the United States, we used the price informationprovided in the petition as the best information available, pursuant tosection 776(c) of the Act. We deducted freight, U.S. customs duties, andbrokerage and handling charges from the United States price estimated bypetitioners. We made an addition to United States price for indirect taxeswhich were later rebated by reason of the exportation of the subject merchandiseto the United States, in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act.Consistent with our practice in past investigations [<T3>see, e.g., Barbed Wire and Barbless Fencing Wire From Argentina; FinalDetermination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value </T3>(50 FR 38563_September23, 1985)], we limited the addition to 6.34 percent of the value of theexported product, which is the amount of allowable indirect taxes foundto have been paid by Laminfer in the concurrent countervailing duty investigationof the subject merchandise [<T3>see Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations and CountervailingDuty Orders; Certain Welded Carbon Steel Pipe and Tube Products from Argentina</T3>(53 FR 37619_September 27, 1988)].<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>Since we did not have specific data with respect to the quantities andprices of the subject merchandise sold in Argentina or third countries,we used the average home-market price of the subject merchandise providedin the petition as the best information available, pursuant to section776(c) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>The petitioner alleges that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respectto imports of LWRT from Argentina. Under section 735(a)(3) of the Act,critical circumstances exist if we determine that there is a reasonablebasis to believe or suspect that:(A) (i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or (ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was importedknew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and(B) there have been massive imports of the Class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports.Based on our analysis of Bureau of the Census import data, we find thatimports of LWRT from Argentina have not been massive over a relativelyshort period of time. Therefore, we need not address the issues of whetherimporters knew, or should have known, that the exporters were selling thesubject merchandise at less than its fair value, or whether there is ahistory of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kindof merchandise which is the subject of this investigation.In light of the above, we determine that critical circumstances, withinthe meaning of section 735(a) (3) of the Act, do not exist with respectto imports of LWRT from Argentina.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG>General Comments<T3>Comment 1. </T3>Respondent argues that its third-country sales, particularlythose to France, provide a more appropriate basis of comparison with salesto the United States because sales to France and the United States aremade in comparable quantities while home-market sales are made in smallerquantities than U.S. sales.Petitioners, however, contend that non-physical characteristics such assales volume are irrelevant in selecting similar merchandise for purposesof fair-value comparisons. Since there are sufficient home-market saleswith which to compare sales to the United States, the Department has nolegal basis to use third-country sales in making fair-value comparisons.<T3>Doc Response. </T3>We agree with petitioners, and have disregardedLaminfer's third-country sales for purposes of this final determination.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>Respondent submits that sales of the subject merchandiseare made at vastly different levels of trade in Argentina and in the UnitedStates. In Argentina, Laminfer sells relatively small quantities of LWRTto a large number of wholesalers, retailers, and end-users, while in theUnited States it sells very large quantities of LWRT to a small numberof trading companies. Respondent argues therefore that the Department shoulduse only those home-market sales made at the nearest comparable commerciallevel of trade to sales in the United States, <T3>i.e., </T3>sales to wholesalers, in making its fair-value comparisons.<T3>Doc Response. </T3>Because we are using the best information otherwiseavailable in making our final determination, this point is moot.<T3>Comment 3.</T3> Respondent argues further that, even if the Departmentshould use sales to wholesalers in Argentina as a basis of comparison forsales to trading companies in the United States, an adjustment is necessaryto account for differences in commercial levels of trade affecting pricecomparability between the two countries.Petitioners argue, however, that level-of-trade adjustments are predictedsolely on the basis of cost differences among various levels of trade inthe domestic market. According to petitioners, the Department, upheld bythe Court of International Trade, has consistently denied such a claimwhere different levels of trade do not exist in the home market, or wheredifferences in cost cannot be quantified. Because Laminfer did not provideany evidence of cost differences among levels of trade in its domesticmarket, petitioners argue, there is no basis for a level-of-trade adjustmentin this case.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.<T3>Comment 4.</T3> Respondent contends that, because Laminfer sells LWRTin Argentina in much smaller quantities than in the United States, theDepartment should make an adjustment to foreign market value to allow forthese differences in quantities. Laminfer claims that the Department verifiedthese differences, quantified in the September 26, 1988 response but mistakenlylabeled as difference-in-merchandise adjustments.Petitioners argue that the Act and Commerce Regulations allow a difference-in-quantityadjustment only in cases where the amount of any price differential iswholly or partly due to differences in the quantities sold. Petitionersnote that, as a matter of policy, the Department does not make a quantityadjustment based solely on cost savings arising from differences in productionruns or differences in the cost of raw materials. In addition, petitionersclaim that Laminfer incorrectly quantified the proposed adjustment by dividingmonthly costs by the tonnage sold during the month. Because there is nocorrelation between the variable costs of LWRT manufactured in a givenmonth and the amount of LWRT sold in the same month, Laminfer's methodologydoes not accurately measure variances in home-market costs. For these reasons,petitioners argue, the Department should deny this claimed adjustment.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.<T3>Comment 5.</T3> Respondent contends that the Department erred in notsubtracting home-market commission expenses from foreign market value whileit added U.S. commission expenses thereto.Petitioners argue that the Department acted correctly, since the home-marketcommission expenses claimed by Laminfer are not really commission expensesbut actually social welfare payments to company employees. As such, thesepayments are considered to be intracompany transfers of funds, which arepart of the general expenses of the company, rather than costs directlyrelated to particular sales.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.<T3>Comment 6.</T3> Respondent claims that, in making an adjustment toaccount for the differences in selling LWRT by actual weight in the homemarket and by theoretical weight in the United States, the Department erred(1) by comparing the wrong columns of data, (2) in using only two weightedaverages across all categories of merchandise, and (3) in adding, ratherthan subtracting, the cost difference to foreign market value.Petitioners contend that the Department should disallow this claimed adjustmentbecause Laminfer could not substantiate this adjustment at verification,nor could it confirm the actual weight of LWRT sold in the United States.Regardless of whether this adjustment is appropriate or not, petitionersconcur with the Department's methodology at the preliminary determinationsince in some cases the product sold in the United States was more expensivethan the home-market product.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.<T3>Comment 7.</T3> Respondent claims that the Department should make acircumstance-of-sale adjustment for differences in advertising expensesfor purposes of the final determination.Petitioners argue that the advertising samples submitted by Laminfer areneither product-specific nor aimed at a later purchaser of the merchandise,but rather are of a generic nature and targeted to Laminfer's own customers.The Department should therefore follow its regulations and disallow thisadjustment.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.<T3>Comment 8.</T3> Respondent claims that the Department erred in disallowingLaminfer's claimed circumstance-of-sale adjustment for differences in inventorycarrying costs, because these costs bear a direct relationship to the salesbeing investigated.Petitioners argue that the Department should disallow this adjustment sincethe Commerce officials were unable to verify it.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.Petitioners' Comments<T3>Comment 9.</T3> Petitioners claim the December 7, 1988 response, whichwas submitted sixteen days after the publication of the preliminary determinationand five days before the departure of the verification team for Argentina,was untimely and precluded the Department from analyzing the informationtherein contained before verification. Because the revisions submittedby Laminfer were so substantial as to constitute a new response, petitionersargue further, the Department should follow its established policy notto accept entire or even partial responses shortly before or during verificationand use the best information available for purposes of the final determination.<T3>DOC Response.</T3> We agree. <T3>See</T3> our discussion of this issue in the Fair Value Comparisonssection of this notice <T3>supra.</T3><T3>Comment 10.</T3> Petitioners claim that Laminfer erred in removingall sales of round mechanical tubing from its most recent submission ofhome-market sales. Because omitting sales of round mechanical tubing wouldso greatly reduce the number of product matches as to bring the validityof our fair-value comparisons into question, petitioners argue, eitherLaminfer should resubmit new home-market sales data including round mechanicaltubing or the Department should obtain such data from prior submissionsby Laminfer.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.<T3>Comment 11.</T3> Petitioners submit the Department should disallowdeductions to foreign market value for foreign inland insurance, packing,bad debt, and inventory carrying costs, because Commerce officials wereunable to verify them.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.Respondent's Comments<T3>Comment 12.</T3> Respondent argues that critical circumstances, asdefined in section 733(e)(1) of the Act, do not exist with respect to importsof LWRT from Argentina.<T3>DOC Response.</T3> We agree. Although we maintain that our preliminaryaffirmative determination of critical circumstances was justified basedon the information available to us at the time, import data released sincethe preliminary determination show that imports of LWRT from Argentinawere not massive in the months immediately preceding and following thepreliminary determination. Therefore, our final determination with respectto critical circumstances is negative.<T3>Comment 13.</T3> Respondent argues that the Department erred in usingthe month of sale and the first listed dimension as criteria for matchinghome-market sales to U.S. sales. For purposes of the final determination,respondent claims, the Department should match up sales in the two marketsby month of sale, then by finish, and then by similarity in at least twodimension.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.<T3>Comment 14.</T3> Respondent claims that the Department erred in notdeducting certain ``other discounts'' from Laminfer's home-market pricesalthough the preliminary determination does not mention that these discountswere disallowed.<T3>DOC Response. See</T3> response to Comment 2.Currency ConversionWe made currency conversions as of the date of sale in accordance withandSection; 353.56(a)(1) of our regulations. We made all currency conversionsusing the daily exchange rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York.<ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of LWRT from Argentina that are entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption, on or after November 21, 1988, the date ofpublication of the preliminary determination in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The U.S. Customs Service shall require a cashdeposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which theforeign market value of the merchandise subject to this investigation exceedsthe United States price, which is 56.26 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3> This suspension of liquidation will remain in effectuntil further notice.Because our final critical circumstances determination with respect toimports of LWRT from Argentina is negative, we are terminating the retroactivesuspension of liquidation ordered at the time of the preliminary determination.The U.S. Customs Service shall reimburse all cash deposits paid or bondsposted on entries of LWRT from Argentina made prior to November 21, 1988.Article VI:5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that``[n]o product . . . shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailingduties to compensate for the same situation of dumping or export subsidization.''This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act. Sinceantidumping duties cannot be assessed on the portion of the margin attributableto export subsidies, there is no reason to require a cash deposit or bondfor that amount. Accordingly, the level of export subsidies as determinedin <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations and CountervailingDuty Orders; Certain Welded Carbon Steel Pipe and Tube Products from Argentina</T3>(53 FR 37619_September 27, 1988), which is 9.25 percent <T3>ad valorem,</T3> will be subtracted from the dumping margin for depositor bonding purposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification</ITAG>In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITCof our determination. If the ITC determines that material injury, or threatof material injury, does not exist in this case, this proceeding will beterminated and all securities posted as a result of suspension of liquidationwill be refunded. If, however, the ITC determines that material injury,or threat of material injury, does exist, we will issue an antidumpingduty order directing Customs officers to assess an antidumping duty onLWRT from Argentina which is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, forconsumption, on or after the date on which liquidation was suspended. Theantidumping duty will equal the amount by which the foreign market valueof the subject merchandise exceeds United States price.This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19U.S.C. 1673d(d)).<ITAG tagnum="21">March 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
