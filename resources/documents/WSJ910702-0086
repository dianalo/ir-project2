Judge Thomas, who has been sitting on the federal appealscourt in Washington for just 14 months, won't be confirmedwithout a fight in the Senate focusing on his inexperience onthe bench and his strong opposition to affirmative action.</LP><TEXT>   But barring damaging unforeseen revelations about JudgeThomas, Democrats will have a hard time mounting abroad-based campaign against the affable 43-year-old, who issmart, tough and speaks powerfully about overcoming racismand poverty in the deep South.   &quot;Anybody who takes him on in the area of civil rights istaking on the grandson of a sharecropper,&quot; observesconservative Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.   Judge Thomas's nomination yesterday got a restrainedreaction from many Senate Democrats. Civil rights groups,too, said they will have to study his record, both in hisbrief tenure on the appeals court and as chairman of theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission during the Reaganadministration.   Mr. Bush's choice is a bold political move, coming in themidst of the current debate over civil rights legislation andquotas. The president has nominated a man who would be notmerely the second black to serve on the Supreme Court, but aman who embodies the ideal of personal achievement ratherthan reliance on government programs for a leg up.   The choice also will put Democrats on the defensive: JudgeThomas draws praise even from some liberals. &quot;He has been avery good colleague,&quot; says Chief Judge Abner Mikva of theappeals court here, a former Democratic congressman.Moreover, Democrats specifically urged the president toconsider appointing a minority-group member to fill thevacancy that was created when Thurgood Marshall announced hisretirement last Thursday.   Judge Thomas's association with moderate Republican Sen.John Danforth of Missouri, for whom he worked after hisgraduation from Yale Law School in 1974, will also weigh inhis favor. Mr. Danforth's support will help reassure manymoderate Senate Democrats and Republicans, much as NewHampshire GOP Sen. Warren Rudman's sponsorship of DavidSouter did after President Bush nominated him last July.   While liberals will focus on Judge Thomas's legalinexperience, his record on the bench doesn't present themwith the sort of target they had with the articulated,sharply conservative legal views of Robert Bork, whoseSupreme Court nomination was defeated in 1987.   A number of Senate Democrats, including Judiciary ChairmanJoseph Biden of Delaware, stressed when Judge Thomas wasconfirmed for the appeals court that he would face tougherscrutiny if he were nominated for the Supreme Court. But thatwill be a difficult position to defend in light of Mr.Thomas's success last year in deflecting liberal criticism.   Judge Thomas's strong opposition to affirmative action andthe abortion debate will be grist for his confirmationhearings. &quot;I don't know where Judge Thomas stands on awoman's right to choose, but I intend to find out,&quot; saidDemocratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, who was the loneopponent last year in the Senate Judiciary Committee's12-to-1 approval of his appeals court nomination. &quot;Women havea right to know whether Judge Thomas is committed toprotecting their fundamental rights.&quot;   Abortion-rights groups are also likely to be concernedabout the fact that Judge Thomas is a Catholic who spent ayear in a Missouri seminary in the 1960s pondering thepriesthood. As other Supreme Court nominees have done,however, Judge Thomas is likely to go to great lengths toavoid committing himself on abortion, an issue that isexpected to come before the court again and again.   The reaction from civil rights groups was muted. RalphNeas, executive director of the Leadership Conference onCivil Rights, said, &quot;With so many constitutional rights andpersonal liberties at stake, the Senate must make sureClarence Thomas has demonstrated a commitment to equalopportunity and equal justice under the law. . . . We urgethe Senate not to rush to judgment.&quot;   To friends and colleagues of Judge Thomas, his own lifestory is the most compelling thing about him. With JusticeMarshall's retirement, civil rights advocates worried thatthere would no longer be anyone on the court who hadexperienced racial segregation. Though Judge Thomas may notfind favor with those groups, the fact is that he knewnothing but segregation as he grew up outside Savannah, Ga.,in the 1950s.   Born into rural poverty, he lived in a house with nobathroom until he was seven years old. His father left whenhe was young, and his mother sent him to live with hisgrandparents.   The grandparents raised him with strict discipline,instilling in him a strong work ethic, and sent him to anall-black Catholic school run by white nuns. Yesterday,speaking at a news conference at President Bush's home inKennebunkport, Maine, Mr. Thomas choked up when he talkedabout his grandparents' influence. For a moment, it appearedthat he might not be able to finish his statement. He praisedthem as well as &quot;my mother and the nuns, all of whom wereadamant that I grow up to make something of myself.&quot;   As a child, Judge Thomas said, &quot;I could not dare dreamthat I would ever see the Supreme Court, not to mention benominated to it. Indeed, my most vivid childhood memory ofthe Supreme Court was the `Impeach Earl Warren' signs whichlined Highway 17 near Savannah. I didn't quite understand whothis Earl Warren fellow was, but I knew he was in some kindof trouble.&quot;   The first person in his family to attend college, JudgeThomas spent a year at Immaculate Conception Seminary inConception Junction, Mo., before transferring to Holy CrossCollege in Worcester, Mass. After law school, he went to workfor Mr. Danforth, who was then Missouri's attorney general.   After two years in the Monsanto Co. legal department,Judge Thomas rejoined Mr. Danforth, by then a U.S. senator.He then served for a year as chief of the U.S. EducationDepartment's civil rights office before President Reaganappointed him chairman of the EEOC in 1982.   His eight-year tenure at the EEOC was marked bycontroversy. He changed the agency's approach to de-emphasizesettling large numbers of cases quickly, concentratinginstead on instances in which specific victims ofdiscrimination could be identified. In age discrimination,particularly, that created case backlogs that distressedadvocates for senior citizens.   Liberals charged that, across-the-board, the EEOC underMr. Thomas's leadership didn't aggressively attack civilrights violations. &quot;As chairman of the EEOC, Clarence Thomasfailed to demonstrate a commitment to civil rights andliberties,&quot; says Nan Aron of the liberal Alliance forJustice.   But Mr. Thomas had strong views and didn't shrink fromexpressing them. Rather, he seized every opportunity --including writing letters to editors, op-ed page articles andbook reviews -- to attack affirmative action as patronizingand as an ineffective remedy for discrimination. In a 1987letter to The Wall Street Journal, he said, &quot;I firmly insistthat the Constitution be interpreted in a colorblind fashion.. . . I emphasize black self-help, as opposed to racialquotas and other race-conscious legal devices that onlyfurther and deepen the original problem.&quot;   Since he has been on the federal bench, liberal andconservative legal analysts agree, the relatively fewopinions he has written don't suggest a strong ideologicalslant, although he has tended to rule for the government incriminal cases and in business regulatory matters.   One highly controversial case on which Judge Thomas satearlier this year has yet to be decided. A three-judge panelof the appeals court is considering the constitutionality ofa Federal Communications Commission policy giving preferenceto women for broadcast licenses. The others on the panel wereJudges Mikva and James Buckley, a conservative. The questionsare: Will Judge Thomas use the case to once again attackaffirmative action, and will that pour fuel on hisconfirmation fight?   Judge Thomas is well-liked by colleagues, both at theEEOC, where the new headquarters building is named for him,and at the appeals court.   Ricky Silberman, a close friend who is vice chairman ofthe EEOC and whose husband, Laurence, sits on the appealscourt, says: &quot;He is a very simple person who loves to say hewas a farm boy and remains a farm boy.&quot; A sometime jogger andweightlifter, he enjoys reading and listening to musicranging from classical to his favorite, country singer GeorgeJones.   For much of his tenure at the EEOC, Mr. Thomas was asingle parent, raising a son, Jamal. Some friends haveexpressed concern that the bitterness of the divorce from hisfirst wife could spill over into his confirmation hearings.His second wife, Virginia, a deputy assistant secretary atthe Labor Department, is white.   In light of the administration's strong attack on racialquotas in hiring, President Bush's selection of a black manto fill Justice Marshall's seat brought questions aboutwhether he was in fact observing a quota on the court. In hispress conference, Mr. Bush strongly denied the very thoughtof that, insisting that race wasn't a factor in the selectionof Judge Thomas.   &quot;The fact that he is black -- a minority -- has nothing todo with this,&quot; the president said. &quot;He is the bestqualified.&quot;   Judge Thomas, who just turned 43 last week, would be theyoungest Supreme Court justice of the past 100 years with theexception of William O. Douglas, who joined the court when hewas 40. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the Thomasnomination are expected to be held in September. If they gosmoothly, Justice Thomas could be sworn in before the newSupreme Court term begins on Oct. 7.</TEXT></DOC>
