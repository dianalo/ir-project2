He said the House would repackage the plant-closings plan asseparate legislation and act on it before taking up the newlyrefurbished version of its 1,000-page trade bill.   He also said the plan envisions dropping Alaskan oil provisionsthat would have capped exports from the state's new refineries at70,000 barrels a day and 50 percent of output while requiringCanadian-bound crude shipments to detour first to ports in thelower 48 states.   President Reagan was critical of both the plant-closings and theoil provisions in his May 24 veto of the trade bill. The Housesubsequently voted to pass the measure notwithstanding hisobjections but the Senate on June 8 fell short of the two-thirdsneeded for a presidential veto override.   At the core of the bill are provisions to overhaul the systemunder which the United States imposes import curbs to protect U.S.industries and retaliate against international trade violations. Italso would grant the administration authority to make deals incurrent global trade talks.   The bill required companies with 100 or more employees to give60 days notice of plant closings or large-scale layoffs.   Other provisions range from substantial agricultural subsidiesto repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies.   Senate Democrats have been saying they would seek to attach theplant-closings provision to any refurbished trade bill sent fromthe House.   There was no immediate word on whether they would go foward withthat plan or instead redirect their efforts into the separateplant-closings bill.   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has been warningthat any new legislation was likely to become badly bogged down.   Some of the administration's supporters in the Senate, however,have been eager for another crack at the trade issue beforelawmakers adjourn to hit the campaign trail.   Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter earlier called for swiftcongressional action on a more moderate version of tradelegislation. And Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., has beensuggesting that he might sponsor trade legislation of his own.   ``We're working on it,'' Dole said Wednesday. He said it wasnecessary to ``get the ethanol provision out of it, otherwisethere's not going to be a trade bill.''   One provision criticized by Reagan would permit duty-freeimports of ethanol from the Caribbean, a measure hotly opposed byMidwest corn growers.   AFL-CIO and other labor representatives who have beencampaigning for the plant-closings provision for 15 yearsbuttonholed Democratic leaders in a hallway adjacent to the Housechamber Wednesday morning.   At one point, Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., emerged from theHouse chamber, where the Democratic Caucus was meeting, in anapparent effort to smooth any ruffled feathers. They later wereushered into Wright's office.   Wright told reporters he would bring the new, free-standingversion of the plant-closings legislation to the House floor priorto action on the refurbished trade bill. He said there was a goodchance a veto of the plant-closings plan could be overridden.</TEXT></DOC>
