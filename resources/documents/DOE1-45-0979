<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-0979 </DOCNO><TEXT>In this investigation for the first time conventional angiography (CA)and intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA) of the aorticarch and brachiocephalic vascular territory is compared in the same groupof 25 patients. The quality of the image derived from IVDSA is inferiorto that of CA and, moreover, varies with the location. If sufficientlygood, IVDSA has an accuracy of 81 to 91% in comparison to CA for stenoticlesions depending on the site. Ulcerations are missed more frequentlythan with CA. Discrepancies between IVDSA and CA are caused mainly bymisregistration. According to our investigation there are multiple stenoticlesions in the brachiocephalic territory in 84% of the patients. Adequateassessment of the need for surgery in symptomatic patients can thereforeonly be made after complete visualization of the aortic and brachiocephalicvascular territory. If non-invasive methods, like duplex-scanning, cannotfulfill this requirement, IVDSA is the only semi-invasive method thatcan provide the information. It is therefore desirable to improve IVDSAtechnique in the near future instead of changing to intra-arterial DSA(IADSA). Now already the advantages outweight the drawbacks.</TEXT></DOC>
