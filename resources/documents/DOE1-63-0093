<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-63-0093 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the short time that has elapsed since Paul Lauterbur first imaged waterphantoms using magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance imaging has experiencedan exponential growth in terms of technological advancements as wellas medical research and clinical applications. A number of companiesin the United States and Europe are producing magnetic resonance imagersat such a rapid rate that by January 1986, over 300 imagers were in clinicaloperation around the world. Magnetic resonance imaging has captured theimagination of the medical community because of its many advantages whichare: (1) no biological harmful effects have been demonstrated withinthe magnetic field strengths and radiofrequency ranges in present clinicaluse; (2) the absence of ionizing radiation; (3) contrast resolution thatis superior to any other imaging modality and spatial resolution thatis currently approaching that of other imaging modalities; (4) capabilityof direct imaging in the transaxial, coronal, and sagittal planes; (5)a number of imaging techniques are available that permit individualizationfor the particular clinical problem being investigated. Because of thesemany advantages, magnetic resonance imaging will continue to proliferateand advance so that it will eventually become a part of the imaging equipmentin every major hospital in the western world and Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
