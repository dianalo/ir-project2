Boesky, delayed publication of its annual results pending the completion of an investigation into the company's share-trading activities.    In a statement to shareholders yesterday, Cambrian said it appointed the accounting firm Peat, Marwick, Mitchell andamp; Co. to investigate potential liabilities stemming from Mr. Boesky's insider trading offenses in the U.S. The investigation could delay until next year the release of Cambrian's earnings for the year ended Sept. 30, a move that will require shareholder approval at the company's annual general meeting Dec. 30. As a result, Cambrian shares remain suspended, at the equivalent of $1.84 each, from trading on the London Stock Exchange.    Cambrian and its merchant bank adviser, S.G. Warburg andamp; Co., said it still remains committed to &quot;getting (Cambrian's) value into shareholder hands as soon as possible.&quot; That could be &quot;achieved by the sale of the trust to another concern, its liquidation, or by some other means. We don't know what the best alternative is yet,&quot; an official involved with Cambrian said.    Cambrian, which was restructured in 1982 as a vehicle for Mr. Boesky's takeover plays, last month fired Mr. Boesky as its investment adviser and said it intended to cooperate with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's widening investigation of its largest case involving insider trading. Mr. Boesky agreed to pay $100 million in a Nov. 14 settlement of SEC charges against him and agreed to plead guilty to one felony count carrying a prison sentence of one to five years. </TEXT></DOC>
