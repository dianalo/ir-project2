The proceduresfor issuing EFPs are contained in the regulations at 50 CFR 663.10.Two EFP applications to conduct joint venture operations for harvestingshortbelly rockfish (<T3>Sebastes jordani</T3>) in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off thecoasts of Washington, Oregon, and California were received by the NMFS,Northwest Regional Office. Both applicants propose using mid-water trawlgear equipped with one and one-half inch mesh codend liners to catch thissmall rockfish species. Current groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 663.26(b)prohibit use of double-walled codends and mesh size smaller than threeinches in pelagic trawls in the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon,and California. If granted, the EFPs would waive these regulations forthe time, area, and vessels specified.The purpose and goal of both EFPs is to catch sufficient quantities ofshortbelly rockfish to develop a market for this currently underutilizedspecies. The current optimum yield (OY) is 10,000 metric tons (mt), ofwhich 1,000 mt is designated for shore-based processing. The remaining9,000 mt may be made available for joint venture fisheries because it issurplus to the needs of domestic processors.Both applicants intend to operate primarily off the California coast, southof 30 degrees 00andmin172; N. latitude, where the highest concentrationsof shortbelly rockfish are believed to occur. One EFP applicant proposesto harvest 10,000 mt with four or five U.S. catcher vessels (deliveringto one or two foreign processing vessels) between 30 degrees 00andmin172;and 38 degrees 00andmin172; N. latitude. This applicant plans to conductfishing operations between June 15 and August 15, 1989, and intends toexperiment with various product forms, including headed and gutted, filletand minced product. The other applicant proposes to use six U.S. catchervessels (delivering to three foreign processing vessels), north of 36 degrees38andmin172; N. latitude, to harvest 3,000-5,000 mt of shortbelly rockfish.This applicant plans to conduct fishing operations between July 1 and November30, 1989, and intends to produce primarily whole, frozen fish with someheaded and gutted product.Both applicants plan joint venture operations in which their catches ofshortbelly rockfish will be delivered to foreign processing vessels atsea. Current foreign fishing regulations prohibit the receipt or processingof U.S.-harvested fish south of 39 degrees 00andmin172; N. latitude. However,other regulations provide for adjusting area restrictions. Therefore, authorizationfor foreign vessels to operate south of 39 degrees 00andmin172; N. latitudeis possible, but requires a different procedure than is used for issuanceof EFPs. If NOAA Fisheries decides to issue the EFPs after consultationwith the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice will be published requesting public commenton the proposal to allow foreign processing vessels to receive shortbellyrockfish south of 39 degrees 00andmin172; N. latitude. After a 30-day publiccomment period, NOAA Fisheries will again consult with the Council priorto publication of any final notice removing the restriction. The U.S. vesselsrequesting the EFPs may choose not to conduct the experimental fisheryif foreign processing vessels are not allowed south of 39 degrees 00andmin172;N. latitude.In 1982, four EFPs were issued to U.S. fishing vessels to harvest shortbellyrockfish with pelagic trawls in the EEZ off the coast of California fordelivery to a foreign processing vessel. Only two domestic vessels actuallyfished under the EFPs and delivered 707 mt to a foreign processor. Of theamount delivered, 89 percent was shortbelly rockfish, 11 percent was Pacificwhiting, and less than one half of one percent was other rockfish, sablefish,flatfish, and other fish combined. No salmon were taken. One EFP was issuedin both 1983 and 1984 and three EFPs were issued in 1985 to U.S. fishingvessels to harvest shortbelly rockfish for delivery to a shore-based, domesticprocessor. However, no fishing occurred under these EFPs.These applications will be reviewed at the April 4-7, 1989, public meetingof the Council in Portland, Oregon. The decision to approve or deny issuanceof these EFPs will be based on a number of considerations including recommendationsof the Council and comments received from the public. Copies of the applicationsare available for review at the NMFS, Northwest Regional Office, addressabove.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
