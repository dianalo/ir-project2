Various noninvasive diagnostic procedures permit reliableclinical information to be obtained on the localization, extent and geometryof arterial lesions, and the velocity of blood in the vascular system.Determination of symptom-limited ergometry and oscillographic, plethysmographic,Doppler sonographic, light microscopic and magnetic resonance techniquesare all described in more detail. The therapeutic interventions are mentionedwith regard to angiography and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty(PTA), with particular emphasis on the treatment of risk factors, training,and medication. The long-term results are given after PTA for the Freiburgpatient series. Thus, the cooperation of angiologists, radiologists andvascular surgeons considerably optimizes the treatment of patients sufferingfrom occlusive arterial disease.</TEXT></DOC>
