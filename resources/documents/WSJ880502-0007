The speculation is largely based on charts of recent trading activity and observations that despite widespread bearish sentiment, selling pressure hasn't been enough to push the dollar sharply lower.    &quot;The momentum, or lack of it, has been a little frustrating on the downside,&quot; said Teri Reid, a corporate foreign exchange adviser at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago. &quot;There's more of a likelihood to test the upside,&quot; she said.    A spate of positive economic news combined with technical factors to push the dollar higher against continental European currencies and the yen Friday.    The pound, meanwhile, climbed on news that the British trade deficit for March was much narrower than expected. Sterling later surrendered most of its gains. Dealers reported that the Bank of England intervened to smooth the pound's rise as it hit an intraday high of $1.8850.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6775 West German marks, up from 1.6698 Thursday. The dollar also climbed to 125.18 yen, from 124.52. The pound rose to $1.8765, from $1.8729.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 125.28 yen.    The dollar benefited from a series of economic reports Friday and firming interest rates, dealers said. Traders also bought dollars to square short, or oversold, positions in the U.S. currency before an expected liquidity drain in the markets this week caused by holidays in Europe and Japan.    It was reported Friday that the U.S. index of leading economic indicators for March rose 0.8%, a little more than expected, while the February index was revised to a 1.3% increase from the previously reported 0.9% rise. Also, U.S. new single-family home sales were reported to have risen 4% in March. And a small U.S. bank, Riggs National Bank, raised its prime lending rate to 8 3/4% from 8 1/2%.    The mildly stronger dollar set off talk among dealers that a rising U.S. currency may reach significant chart points next week, but none said he expects to see a break beyond 127 yen.    Victor Von Klemperer, manager of foreign exchange at BankAmerica International, said some significant stop-loss buying could be triggered if the dollar continues its upward drift. &quot;If we break through some stops, not too far from where we are now, we could be heading for new highs&quot; compared with levels of the past two weeks, he said.    Against the backdrop of the dollar's stagnant behavior recently, Ms. Reid at Harris Trust said Friday's trading could have shown some short-term buying momentum. &quot;There seemed to have been a little more interest and activity when the dollar was trading up&quot; Friday, she said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 40 cents an ounce to $451 in light trading. The estimated volume was 1.8 million ounces.    In Hong Kong, gold was quoted at $450.70 an ounce in early trading.    ---                   Late New York Trading                  Friday, April 29, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
