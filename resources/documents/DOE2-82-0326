Observed in experiments secondcosine harmonic of longitudinal current density may be connected withthe filament shift eutwards due to finiteness of plasma pressure. Thelongitudinal current initiated at fast plasma heating is defined by shiftand for a more extent elongation of magnetic surfaces. Formulae explicitlycorrelating this current with geometric characteristics are derived.The effect of the current generation - is manifestation of strong dependenceof rotational transformation in a stellarator on the form and relativeposition of magnetic surfaces. The ratios obtained in the paper explainthe character of this dependence.</TEXT></DOC>
