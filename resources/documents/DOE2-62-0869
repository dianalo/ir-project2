<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-62-0869 </DOCNO><TEXT>Boiler tube failures (BTF) are the number one cause of forced outagesof fossil-fined power generating units for U.S. electric utilities. Over40,000 incidents have been reported by utilities to the North AmericanElectric Reliability Council (N E R C) over the last decade. The averageunit availability loss during this period due to BTF was six percent,resulting in annual cost penalties of $7.5 billion. Failure analysesof those units with annual losses above two or three percent usuallyreveal a &quot;repeat&quot; tube failure problem. Repeat (as opposed to random)tube failures can be defined as frequent, multiple failures with thesame physical appearance, occurring in the same flow circuit or eventhe same tube, resulting from the same failure mechanism and root-cause.Most repeat tube failure problems are also usually accompanied by a decreasing,in some cases predictable, mean-time to the next forced outage.</TEXT></DOC>
