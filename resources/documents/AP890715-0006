Former HUD Assistant Secretary for Housing Shirley McVay Wisemanalso says Carla Hills, currently the U.S. trade representative,lobbied Pierce to lift restrictions on a mortgage lender now underfederal criminal investigation.   Hills is scheduled to testify before the committee on Monday.   Wiseman said in sworn testimony Friday that Pierce personallycalled her and instructed her to approve more than $15 million infunding for a Durham, N.C., project sought by a former Pierce lawpartner.   Pierce said: ``I want the project funded,'' Wiseman told theHouse Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing,one of three congressional panels investigating mismanagement andfraud at the housing agency.   The HUD approval brought more than $11.3 million in rentsubsidies, a $2.3 million grant and more than $3 million in taxcredits to developers who were seeking to turn a hosiery mill intoan apartment complex, said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman ofthe subcommittee.   Pierce has testified he set up a three-person panel to makefunding decisions for the moderate rehabilitation program, but saidhe maintained ``final authority'' over the decisions.   ``I did not plan, however, to get into the decision-makingprocess of the panel when there was no complaint to justify my doingso,'' he told the subcommittee in May.   Efforts by The Associated Press to reach Pierce for comment wereunsuccessful. Lantos said he would seek to recall Pierce to thesubcommittee before the congressional recess Aug. 4.   Wiseman said she told Pierce she could not fund the project overthe objections of career HUD employees who had been ``violentlyopposed'' to the project.   The project was eventually approved by Wiseman's successor, JanetHale, who said she believed she was ``acting on the approval of myboss.''   Wiseman also testified that DRG Funding Corp., a private lenderthat was suspended from participating in a $5 billion program inwhich HUD insured large portions of mortgages, was allowed to getback into the program after lobbying from Hills, a former HUDSecretary.   DRG is now under FBI criminal investigation.   Wiseman said DRG's ability to underwrite mortgages had beenplaced on hold during the Reagan administration because ofinfractions of department rules. The suspension remained despite ameeting with Hills in late 1984 or early 1985 to get therestrictions lifted.   ``It was not a convincing argument,'' Wiseman said.   But DRG's probation was lifted despite the concerns of staffmembers, she said. ``It was later brought to my attention that Hillshad ... taken the case to Secretary Pierce. I was informed by staffthat there was a meeting,'' she said.   Lawmakers expressed concern about the conflicting testimonyregarding Pierce.   ``The factual noose seems to be tightening around Samuel Pierce'sneck,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.   ``We were very careful about asking him if he had ever tried toinfluence any project and we have two people making it very clearthat he wanted a particular project funded,'' said Rep. ChristopherShays, R-Conn.   Meanwhile, HUD filed suit in Forth Worth, Texas, on Fridayseeking to recover more than $2.5 million a Texas woman is accusedof bilking from the agency and spending on real estate, cars andguns. The woman is one of 10 closing agents nationwide the agencybelieves defrauded HUD of about $10 million.</TEXT></DOC>
