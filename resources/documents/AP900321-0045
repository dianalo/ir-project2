Susan Molinari, a 31-year-old Republican City Council member,easily prevailed Tuesday to fill the post vacated by her father,Guy Molinari, who resigned to become Staten Island boroughpresident. She had 60 percent of the vote.   Democratic Assemblyman Jose Serrano won even more easily toreplace Robert Garcia, a Democrat who quit his South Bronx seatafter his conviction in the Wedtech influence-peddling scandal.Serrano, 46, had 92 percent against lackluster opposition.   He will be the only Puerto Rico native serving as a full votingmember of Congress. Molinari, whose district includes Staten Islandand a sliver of Brooklyn, will be the youngest member of Congress.   ``I'm just thrilled and very honored by what has taken placetonight,'' said Molinari, who took a congratulatory telephone callfrom President Bush.   She called voters in her district _ where Democrats predominatebut often cross party lines _ ``probably the most sophisticated inthe city.''   Serrano, who rose from poverty to political prominence,celebrated with Mayor David Dinkins and supporters in a Bronxrestaurant. Noting the day's foul weather, he exulted: ``Here weare _ a little bit damp and a lotta bit happy.''   The Hispanic leader had 26,719 votes, or 92 percent, andRepublican Simeon Golar had 2,027 votes, or 8 percent, with allprecincts in. Turnout, traditionally low in the district, was about14 percent of the registered voters.   Molinari had 45,682 votes, or 60 percent, and Democrat Robert J.Gigante had 25,916 votes, or 34 percent, with all precinctsreporting. Two minor party candidates shared the rest. Turnout wasabout 31 percent.   Serrano moved to the Bronx with his family when he was 7 andworked as a bank teller, among other jobs, before winning hisAssembly seat in 1974. He rose to be Education Committee chairman,earning a reputation as an earnest and thorough legislator.   Jose Roberto Martinez, director of the Puerto Rican federalaffairs office in Washington, said he expected Serrano to take alead in representing Puerto Rican concerns. ``Absolutely, it willbe helpful,'' he said.   For his part, Serrano noted that his congressional district isone of the nation's poorest and said he plans to speak often withschoolchildren, encouraging them to improve their lives.   ``Representing this district is more than being a congressman,''he said in an interview. ``It's like being a big brother, a socialworker, a friend to people who need someone to talk to them and toencourage them to go on.''   Molinari won by dint of her own success in the City Council aswell as her father's popularity. Elected to the council by a161-vote margin in 1985, she won re-election last year in alandslide.   Her father, who held the seat since 1980, was co-chairman ofBush's campaign in New York in 1988, and his contacts should helpher establish a presence in Congress.   At the same time, Molinari has cited her independence from herfather and from the Bush administration on matters such aslegalized abortion, which she supports. In the campaign shestressed environmental issues, a prime concern in Staten Island.</TEXT></DOC>
