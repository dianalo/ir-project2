The results, announced at a LosAngeles press conference yesterday, shocked the nation: Oneof the greatest athletes of his generation was infected withthe AIDS virus and would end his career as a professionalbasketball player.   How Mr. Johnson discovered his infection suddenly casts aspotlight on the intersection between AIDS, the worstinfectious disease of the era, and the insurance industry,which once feared the disease would depress profits for yearsand jack up premiums of all kinds. As recently as 1987,experts predicted that by the year 2000, life insurancecompanies would pay a cumulative total of as much as $50billion in death benefits on individual policies because ofAIDS.</LP><TEXT>   The experts were wrong, and Mr. Johnson's experience helpsexplain why. Even as the AIDS toll continues to mount -- asmany as 47,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with thedisease this year, and many more will learn they are infectedwith the HIV -- insurers have paid only a fraction of whatthey expected. For the insurance industry -- but not for AIDSpatients -- the worst may be over.   The largest factor in the industry's apparent escape fromfinancial disaster has been its use of blood testing toscreen out insurance applicants carrying the AIDS virus. &quot;Ifit hadn't been for the life insurance, I wouldn't haveknown,&quot; Mr. Johnson said at his press conference. &quot;I took thetest only because of a life insurance policy.&quot;   Though many companies began using the tests as early as1985, the practice was subjected to strenuous legal challengein many states, leaving the industry in doubt for a period ofyears about whether it would be allowed to rely on theprocedure.   By 1989, both federal and state courts had upheld theinsurers, however, changing forever the way insurers dobusiness and introducing medical testing into insurancedecisions on an unprecedented scale. &quot;Before AIDS, aninsurance company could issue a policy to a 35-year-old maleand do minimal underwriting {medical screening}. AIDS changedthat,&quot; says John Hanrahan, assistant actuary at PrudentialInsurance Co. of America.   The implications of HIV testing stretch even further,however. Indeed, the insurance industry's response to theAIDS crisis is a case study in how tenaciously insurers' willdefend their right to deny insurance to individuals basedupon medical information about them. Though medicalunderwriting has long been an accepted part of the insurancebusiness, battles such as the one over HIV testing are likelyto be repeated in the future as more types of medicalinformation, including genetic information, becomes availableto insurers.   The insurance industry's widespread use of blood tests hasbeen costly to society, to be sure. Most important, thepractice can leave the sick without access to insurance, at atime when they need it most. Although the same is true forother serious and fatal health conditions, it is by no meansless tragic.   Others who carry the virus are locked into their currentjobs because of fear that a job change could also mean losinginsurance coverage. Fear of being fired by an employerbecause they carry the HIV has prompted others to usepseudonyms for treatment or to pay for treatment out of theirown pocket.   But the industry says the tests have allowed it to keeppremiums for all policyholders lower by reducing exposure toAIDS claims, which would raise costs. The tests also haveallowed insurers to detect other health risks in applicants,such as alcohol and drug abuse, in addition to the HIV.   At Prudential, while the company expected AIDS claims onindividual life insurance as a percentage of the total toreach 15%, it now believes the percentage will not rise above7% -- if it gets that high. Last year it paid out $14.2million or 2% of its total individual life insurance claimsfor AIDS deaths. &quot;It's gone from being an unknown to beingmeasurable -- and it's not as bad as we feared,&quot; Mr. Hanrahansays.   Similarly, AIDS claims at Lincoln National Life InsuranceCo. were half the size projected last year, says RichardRobertson, chief financial officer. &quot;It's pretty clear thatAIDS is manageable from an insurer's point of view,&quot; he says.   Ironically, Lincoln National's president, Ian Rolland, wasone of the industry people doing a lot of worrying out loudabout the issue several years ago. Many others, too, werespooked about the impact of AIDS. The fears were fanned by a1986 conference in Berkeley Springs, W.Va., where the Centersfor Disease Control released startling projections. At thetime it was believed 1.5 million people were infected. Inthree years, the CDC predicted, the number of peopledeveloping AIDS in one year would triple to 58,000.   That touched off panic in some quarters of the lifeinsurance industry. A newsletter, AIDS Insurance Reports,carried an article that was widely circulated titled&quot;Apocalypse Soon.&quot; It predicted AIDS would ultimately lead to&quot;two nations -- infected and uninfected -- where one stoodbefore.&quot; The calculation took CDC data and assumed theworst-case scenario for spread of the disease. Under themodel used, new AIDS diagnoses each year would leap to190,000 by the year 2000.   At an October 1987 presentation in Montreal, a team ofactuaries made a similarly worrisome, albeit less emotional,prediction of the disease's impact on the life insuranceindustry. The authors of that study believed AIDS claimswould eventually total 10% of all death claims, enough tolead to serious financial problems for some companies and toforce others to raise premiums for all.   &quot;By the time people die from cancer or heart disease, wehave already built their claim into our reserves,&quot; says Mr.Hanrahan of Prudential. By contrast, AIDS often strikes soearly in life that insurers cannot collect enough premiums toprevent losses. As AIDS claims mount, they throw off thecompanies' calculations for the amount of premium revenuethey will need to cover payouts.   The outlook has improved dramatically since 1987, however.Nearly all of the earlier estimates have been lowered. TheCDC now believes the number of people carrying the HIV in theU.S. numbers one million, rather than 1.5 million. Though theCDC once predicted the number of new AIDS cases reported thisyear would be as many as 70,000, it now estimates 47,000.   Part of the explanation is undoubtedly the role ofeducational programs about the epidemic and safer sexualpractices in both the homosexual and heterosexualcommunities. And rather than spreading rapidly amongheterosexuals as some expected, AIDS has spread more withingroups such as intravenous drug users, who typically aren'tbuyers of life insurance.   As a result, Medicaid is increasingly footing the tab forAIDS medical costs. &quot;We have a lot of data that shows adecline proportionately in the people covered by privateinsurance and a big increase in people covered by Medicaid,&quot;says Peter Arno, an economist who has studied the effects ofAIDS on the nation's economy.   As these trends have taken shape, both life and healthinsurers have revised their estimates of the eventual impact.The American Council of Life Insurance now believes lifeinsurers will pay a cumulative total of $10 billion in AIDSdeath claims under individual life insurance policies by theyear 2000, rather than the $50 billion once foreseen.   &quot;We're running somewhat below even that {lower}projection,&quot; says Daniel Case, an actuary with the ACLI. Lastyear, life insurers paid out an estimated $1.2 billion,slightly more than their $1 billion payout in 1989. Andhealth insurers paid out $534 million last year, exactlyequal to the amount of AIDS claims they paid in 1989.   One reason horror stories in the insurance industryrelated to AIDS are rare is that most insurers began testingas early as they could. Initially, testing for the HIVrepresented a conundrum for insurance companies, however.   Though testing has come to be accepted as an insurer'sright, it presented a thorny public relations dilemma for theindustry. When some companies announced that they had adoptedblood testing policies, regulators in some states and AIDSactivists objected swiftly and vehemently.   Legal challenges were made in New York, California, theDistrict of Columbia and Minnesota. It was argued thattesting constituted unfair discrimination. But by 1989, bothfederal and state courts had upheld insurers' right to testfor the disease, just as they are able to screen outapplicants with other serious and terminal illnesses.   At first, the test also had the disadvantage of beingexpensive. At $75, it cost too much for insurers to use forall but the largest policies. They believed that left themopen to exposure from people with the HIV who would apply forinsurance just under the cutoff amount.   Prudential, for example, began using blood tests severalyears ago for life policies of $500,000 and over. As thetests have become less expensive, however, Prudential haslowered that amount several times and now tests beforeselling policies as small as $50,000 to $60,000. Most lifeinsurers have similar practices, testing for policies over$100,000. If the applicant tests positive, the insurancecompany will ordinarily reject him or her.   Among health insurers, the use of blood tests varies morewidely. Typically, large employers, which are self-insuredand use an insurer only for administration, do not test theiremployees for AIDS before offering medical coverage. BlueCross and Blue Shield companies, which serve as an insurer oflast resort in many states, typically do not test for the HIVbefore offering coverage either. Employees of smallcompanies, however, are often tested by their employer'shealth insurer before qualifying for medical insurancecoverage.   That has had a huge impact on the thousands of individualswho now carry the virus. &quot;Many small companies try not tohire people with HIV because of the perceived impact on theirhealth insurance premiums,&quot; says June Osborn, dean of thepublic health school at University of Michigan.   Mark Scherzer, a New York attorney who arranges seminarson topics such as insurance for people with AIDS, says manyclients consult him on whether to change jobs after they havetested positive for the disease. &quot;I advise against it,&quot; hesays. &quot;If they're going to work for a small employer, they'rereducing their long term financial security.&quot;   An equally important problem, he says, is that people whocarry HIV will often pay their own medical bills, rather thansubmit insurance claims, out of fear that they will bedismissed by their employers. &quot;I'd say 20% of the people atmy seminars have been in that situation,&quot; he says.   One young lawyer at a large national law firm, who spokeon the condition of anonymity, went to see his doctor under apseudonym and paid for treatment himself for one year afterhe tested positive for the HIV. &quot;If I filed claims I wasconvinced my employer would find out about my status and fireme,&quot; he says. Recently, because of health concerns and hisdesire for a less strenuous work schedule, he decided to tellhis employer and encountered an unexpectedly compassionateresponse.   Others have not been so lucky, however. &quot;It's anirrational system that restricts job mobility according tosomething that has nothing to do with ability,&quot; Mr. Scherzersays.</TEXT></DOC>
