George Bush, he said, &quot;played a major role in everything we've accomplished.&quot; It was Mr. Reagan's answer to the chant, &quot;Where was George?&quot; that rocked the Democratic convention in Atlanta.    &quot;So George,&quot; the president said, &quot;I'm in your corner. . . . But George, just one personal request: Go out there and win one for the Gipper.&quot;    Vice President Bush watched Mr. Reagan on television in his quarters in Washington, where he was moving closer to making up his mind about a running mate. Mr. Bush is scheduled to arrive here today and to meet Mr. Reagan briefly at a nearby naval air station before Mr. Reagan boards Air Force One and flies off to a vacation at his California ranch.    Mr. Bush is scheduled to disclose his running mate Thursday morning, but unconfirmed reports suggested he might move that up to Wednesday night, when he is to receive his party's presidential nomination.    But last night was Ronald and Nancy Reagan's night, a masterful television production that drew almost as many laughs as tears, though the speech was lengthy and Mr. Reagan stumbled uncharacteristically in several places. Even if it wasn't vintage Reagan, it may have reminded some in the audience what a tough act this is going to be for George Bush to follow.    Mrs. Reagan, introduced by actor Tom Selleck, made her own farewells. &quot;I'll miss you,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll never forget you. So good night and God bless.&quot;    Mr. Reagan's dramatic appearance was preceded by a film that highlighted the ups -- and some of the downs -- of his White House career.    In his speech, Mr. Reagan, saying &quot;facts are stubborn things,&quot; reminded delegates and millions of television viewers that the nation had gone through &quot;the two worst back-to-back years of inflation in 60 years&quot; when he and Mr. Bush took office almost eight years ago. Interest rates, he said, &quot;had jumped to over 21% -- the highest in 120 years.&quot; Industrial production was down, he said, and the so-called misery index -- the sum of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate -- was up.    Eight years ago, the president said, &quot;Our national defense had been so weakened, the Soviet Union had begun to engage in reckless aggression, including the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan.&quot; He added, &quot;On any given day, we had military aircraft that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts and ships that couldn't leave port for the same reason or for lack of a crew.&quot;    Now, he said, things have been turned around. &quot;We hear talk,&quot; he said, &quot;that it's time for a change. Well, ladies and gentlemen, another friendly reminder: We are the change.&quot;    His administration, he said, cut tax rates for working people, created 17.5 million good jobs, broke the back of inflation and rebuilt the nation's armed services.    &quot;And virtually all of this change occurred -- and continues to occur -- in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that it's time for a change,&quot; Mr. Reagan said.    He conceded one problem -- the budget deficit. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;it's much too high.&quot; But he put the blame for this squarely on the Congress and its Democratic leadership. If Congress &quot;had passed my first spending plan in 1982,&quot; he said, &quot;the cumulative outlays and deficits would have been $207 billion lower by 1986.&quot;    In fact, however, Mr. Reagan has never proposed a balanced budget. In his first seven years in office, the deficits have come to $1.26 trillion. The budget Mr. Reagan proposed in 1982, calling for cuts in food stamps, Medicaid and federal retirement programs, was never taken seriously by Congress, including the GOP-controlled Senate, and the economic projections on which it was based turned out to be seriously flawed. He predicted, for example, that the economy would grow 3% in 1982. It contracted 2.1%.    He specifically credited Vice President Bush with major contributions in heading a task force to reduce federal paperwork and in traveling to Europe and persuading heads of NATO countries to deploy Pershing and ground-launched cruise missiles &quot;on the NATO line,&quot; an action that he said ultimately persuaded the Soviet Union to sign the treaty curbing intermediate-range nuclear forces and begin removing their SS-20 missiles from Europe.    &quot;Without George Bush to build on these policies,&quot; he said, &quot;everything we have achieved will be at risk. All the work, sacrifice and effort of the American people could end in the very same disaster that we inherited in 1981.&quot;    In praising Mr. Bush for taking part in all the administration's major decisions, the president skipped over any role the vice president may have had in the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair or in the administration's dealings with Panamanian strongman and alleged drug trafficker Manuel Noriega.    He lauded Mr. Bush as &quot;someone who's big enough and experienced enough to handle tough and demanding negotiations with (the Soviet leader) Mr. Gorbachev.&quot;    &quot;It will take someone who has seen this office from the inside,&quot; Mr. Reagan said, &quot;who senses the danger points, will be cool under fire and knows the range of answers when the tough questions come.    &quot;That's the George Bush I've seen up close -- when the staff and cabinet members have closed the door and when the two of us are alone: someone who's not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to the core of an issue, someone who never runs away from a fight, never backs away from his beliefs and never makes excuses.&quot;    Mr. Reagan was addressing just about the closest thing possible to a unanimously appreciative audience. In an NBC News survey of 1,015 Republican convention delegates, 98% said they have a favorable opinion of the president -- the same percentage as have a favorable view of Mr. Bush.    In addition, 85% of the delegates said they want to continue along the path of Mr. Reagan's policies; in the country as a whole, 58% want a change of direction, according to the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.    Although the delegates overwhelmingly express a favorable view of Mr. Bush, they see themselves as somewhat to the right of him. According to the survey, 70% of the delegates regard themselves as conservatives, but only 41% think of the vice president as conservative. Most delegates -- 56% -- think he's a moderate, while only 25% described themselves that way.    In his speech, Mr. Reagan followed the GOP's script: Last night, convention officials had decreed, would include a full measure of boasting about the past, tonight will be about defining the issues, tomorrow is reserved for defining the candidate, and on Thursday, the climactic night, Mr. Bush and his vice presidential nominee will appear before the convention to state their case before the American people.    But Mr. Reagan couldn't leave center stage without some personal anecdotes of the kind that have endeared him to his partisans.    &quot;What times we've had!&quot; he said.    &quot;Twilight? Not in America. . . . That's not possible, because I confess there are times when I feel like I'm still 'Dutch' Reagan racing my brother down the hill to the swimming pool under the railroad bridge over the Rock River.    &quot;You see, there's no sweeter day than each new one because here in our country, it means something wonderful can happen to you.    &quot;And something wonderful happened to me.&quot;    He said, &quot;There's still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch, fences that need repair and horses to ride.    &quot;But I want you to know that if the fires ever dim, I'll leave my phone number and address behind, just in case you need a foot soldier. Just let me know, and I'll be there.&quot;    And then he said good-bye. </TEXT></DOC>
