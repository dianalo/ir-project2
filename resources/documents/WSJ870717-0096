Heinz Co. with 62 safety and health violations at its Wethersfield, Conn., frozen-dinners plant, and proposed &quot;severe&quot; fines totaling $463,500.    The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it proposed that level of penalties because of a &quot;long-term failure to correct recognized safety hazards,&quot; including a lack of adequate guards on meat-grinding equipment.    The plant, which has shown an injury rate nearly double the industry's national average, is operated by Foodways National Inc., a unit of Pittsburgh-based Heinz's Ore-Ida Foods Inc.    &quot;Despite our repeated efforts to work with Foodways to correct serious safety hazards, the company has time and time again failed to correct these problems, as it promised it would,&quot; John Pendergrass, an assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said.    A spokeswoman for Ore-Ida Foods and Foodways National said that the agency's inspection was made in January and that to her knowledge there was &quot;no contact about the violations&quot; since that time, until the company received the report yesterday. &quot;We are in the process of thoroughly reviewing the report,&quot; she said. &quot;Preliminary indications are that the majority of the issues raised by OSHA have already been corrected.&quot;    She also said: &quot;The company is committed to safety in its operations and has taken the necessary steps to comply with the inspection. We plan to meet with OSHA to insure that all issues have been resolved.&quot;    The agency cited Foodways with 46 alleged willful violations, including failure to maintain guards on machines to protect workers from rotating parts in meat grinders, and allowing exposed chains and sprockets on machinery.    The type of equipment involved in the charges is a major source of injuries in food factories, OSHA said. Other alleged violations include exposed electrical parts and drive belts, and unstable stacking of storage material.    A willful violation of OSHA rules is one in which an employer knew that a violation occurred, or was aware of a hazardous condition, and didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it. Foodways has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed fines before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.    In 1985 and 1986, Foodways had a rate of 10.4 cases of worker injuries causing lost work days for each 100 workers -- nearly double the national average of 5.6 cases per 100 workers for the frozen-specialties industry, OSHA said.    Foodways has undergone several previous OSHA inspections, the agency said. The latest began last January, when the factory was selected for inspection under an OSHA program that targets hazardous industries, including food processing.    The lack of machine guards was cited in previous inspections, the agency said, and the company then indicated it understood the need for guards and gave OSHA progress reports stating that steps were being taken to install them. But the latest inspection showed that Foodways hadn't ensured the guards would stay in place, OSHA said.    &quot;Deliberately refusing to follow through in providing necessary safeguards for workers is unacceptable,&quot; Mr. Pendergrass said. </TEXT></DOC>
