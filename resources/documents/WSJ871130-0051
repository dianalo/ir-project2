For a woman seeking promotion opportunities, Avon Products Inc. might be one place to go calling. There, a stunning 81% of officials and managers are women -- compared with a national average of about 25%, according to federal statistics.    But at Avon, &quot;where all these women at the top are obviously being advanced, there's very little in the way of benefits,&quot; says Rosalyn Will of the Council on Economic Priorities, an advocacy group for corporate social responsibility that recently conducted a major survey of companies for Ms. magazine.    For benefits, especially for working parents, one company that excels is International Business Machines Corp. IBM offers both men and women up to a year of unpaid leave for child care or special projects, provides a mammoth child-care consultation and referral program and has just set up a similar program to help employees with caring for elderly parents.    As these examples show, no single company yet seems to fill all the needs of women and working parents. Indeed, many women's groups and other critics argue that most companies need substantial improvement.    But a few corporations are taking leadership roles in removing barriers to women's advancement and in helping to reduce the tension that arises when job and family responsibilities conflict. Advocates of such programs contend that they not only foster employee satisfaction but can also enhance productivity. What corporate America is discovering, says Dana Friedman, a senior research associate at the Conference Board, is that &quot;these issues will ultimately affect the bottom line.&quot;    The Wall Street Journal asked a panel of groups that track issues related to women and the workplace to identify some of the companies that stand out in four specific areas. The groups queried are: Catalyst, the Conference Board's Work and Family Information Center, the Coalition of Labor Union Women and the Council on Economic Priorities.    Some groups made recommendations only in some categories. The following list doesn't include all of the programs that now exist at many companies, but it does include some of the best.    BEST IN STRATEGIC PLANNING   Specific programs aimed at finding ways to better utilize women and meet the needs of working parents.    MERCK andamp; CO.: &quot;They think like scientists; they know where they're going,&quot; says Ellen Galinsky, who directs a Bank Street College of Education study at Merck. The Rahway, N.J.-based pharmaceutical company uses extensive employee surveys and focus groups to help determine how best to mesh work and family life.    DU PONT CO.: Since August, the big chemical company has had a Corporate Work and Family Committee whose 19 members -- ranging from a group vice president to a lab technician -- meet monthly. The committee will make recommendations early next year on a wide variety of issues, with a particular emphasis on child care. A similar committee set up three years ago led to the creation of a community-based resource and referral system for child care at Du Pont headquarters in Wilmington, Del.    Startling statistics on employee need helped spur the company to act. A survey in 1985 of 20,000 employees at four corporate sites found that 70% of all employees with children under age 13 -- or 24% of the total work force -- used some form of child care outside the home. Their biggest concern was finding high-quality care near work, especially for children under age three. The numbers were &quot;compelling,&quot; says Faith Wohl, who is co-chairman of the committee, and &quot;really established for our company management that this was a mainstream employment issue.&quot;    EASTMAN KODAK CO.: The company's Child Care Study Group, which began meeting early this year, is exploring a number of issues related to the needs of working parents. The latest in a series of committees convened over the past 10 years to address such concerns, the group is made up of employees from all levels, and is in contact with a management-review team that periodically assesses its work and takes forward recommendations. &quot;We are looking at employee demographics and listening to employees, who are coming to us and telling about their problems,&quot; says Mary Harrington, director of corporate employee relations.    Among the policies that have emerged from the group is flexible work scheduling, with such options as part-time work and job sharing. A &quot;family-leave&quot; policy unveiled last month allows men and women up to four months of job-protected unpaid leave for the care of newborn, adopted, foster and sick children or parents.    BEST IN CORPORATE CULTURE   Promoting an atmosphere that reduces stress caused by work-family conflicts and defuses tension between men and women.    DU PONT: The company has held workshops for several years on a variety of topics to help managers and employees &quot;address the challenges&quot; arising from the big advance of women into the work force. These include seminars on sexual harassment and personal safety during business travel, and on rape prevention.    The company also sponsors monthly seminars called Women and Men Working Together as Colleagues to explore the differences between the sexes and enhance communication. The goal, says a spokesman, is to &quot;get our people to realize whether they intend it or not that many times we're paternalistic.&quot;    In addition, women from three experience levels in the corporation meet regularly as part of a program begun in the spring of 1986 called Corporate and Individual Realities for Women. Company officials say the workshop aims to help women better manage gender-related issues by sharing personal experiences and clarifying what the corporation needs in comparison with their own career goals.    Jane McManus, a 22-year Du Pont veteran and mother of two, says the Realities workshop helped her learn how to network in the corporation and how to handle guilt about child care and household chores. &quot;It was interesting how the younger women were able to help me see that I didn't have to be Superwoman,&quot; she says.    DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP.: The Maynard, Mass.-based computer-systems company has a program called Valuing Difference, which has evolved over the past six years. As part of the program, groups of eight to 10 employees meet regularly to discuss a broad range of topics, including themselves, their behavior and stereotypes, and the differences between men and women.    Out of the meetings has come a Womens' Advisory Group composed of senior women. The company is also starting a nationwide resource and referral service for child care, partly as a response to concerns raised in the core groups.    BEST IN BENEFITS   IBM: The company's child-care consultation and referral service offers information about child-care providers in 200 communities. Since it was established in 1984, the service has been used by 21,000 IBM families. IBM funding has also helped upgrade the quantity and quality of child-care facilities nationwide.    IBM, which conducts continuous employee opinion surveys (each employee is polled on average every 18 months), now plans to promote elder care as well. Starting early next year, a company-funded network of community agencies will provide consultation on problems with the elderly, referrals to medical services, home-delivered meals and other services. IBM added the benefit after an in-house survey showed that 30% of employees had some responsibility for an elderly relative.    James Parkel, director of personnel plans and programs, says that while he's &quot;never been asked to prove a bottom line&quot; for the programs, &quot;it doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you can handle some of your employees' problems . . . they are in fact going to be more productive.&quot;    IBM offers, too, a flexible work schedule, up to $1,750 for adoption expenses and up to $500 to help relocating spouses find new jobs. Employees returning from the year of unpaid leave can work part-time for an additional year. The company is also currently piloting a referral program for sick-child care in several locations.    MERCK: The company offers both men and women unpaid parental leave of up to 18 months for preparation for childbirth and for care after the birth or adoption of a child. Seven years ago, Merck invested $100,000 to help establish a child-care center near its headquarters. Now, it is helping to build a new site to house the center and has provided support to a child-care center near one of its plants. Also, Merck is planning to provide child-care resource and referral information to its employees nationwide.    Other benefits include flexible hours, spouse-employment assistance and, particularly for those returning from maternity leave, limited part-time work and work-at-home options. A company study on productivity found decreases in absenteeism and tardiness as a result of flexible work schedules.    CAMPBELL SOUP CO.: The Camden, N.J.-based company grants up to three months of unpaid leave to mothers and fathers for taking care of newborn, adopted or seriously ill children or other family members. The company has an on-site child-care facility at its headquarters with room for 123 children six weeks old to kindergarten age, and plans to expand it to accommodate an 80-child waiting list. Campbell subsidizes about 60% of costs, with parents' net fees ranging from $41 a week for a preschooler to $59 a week for an infant.    In addition, the company has pre- and postnatal exercise and nutrition programs and an anti-sex-harassment training program. It also has flexible scheduling and job sharing available to all employees except those on production-shift work.    BEST IN ADVANCEMENT   AVON: The New York-based cosmetics company has three women on its 13-member board of directors and five women among its 21 corporate officers. The 81% ratio of female officials and managers is thought to be the highest percentage of women at such management levels of any Fortune 500 company. &quot;They put a great emphasis on tapping the leadership and understanding that the female work force can bring to their particular products,&quot; says Arlene Johnson, vice president of programs for Catalyst.    The company also has a Minority and Women's Participation Council that meets every other month to devise strategies for upward mobility for both groups. The council, which has been in place for about 3 1/2 years, includes among its members the company's chairman, its president and the heads of the operating divisions.    XEROX CORP.: The Stamford, Conn.-based office-equipment and financial-services company has one woman on its 15-member board and one woman among 35 corporate officers, and 24% of its officials and managers are women. In addition, many more women are moving into the management pipeline. More than 40% of the Xerox sales force is female, and it is from such jobs that management recruits have traditionally been drawn. The company has long had what it calls the Balanced Workforce Targeting Program, which helps set numerical employment goals for women and minorities.    GANNETT CO.: The publishing company has four women on its 17-member board. In addition, women hold 38% of the top four jobs at each of Gannett's daily newspapers and radio and television stations. There are 19 female publishers at the chain's 90 daily newspapers.    ---                   Work and Family Conflicts   In a survey of 1,200 employees at one large company, thesepercentages of each group agreed with the followingstatements:   &quot;My concentration or judgment at work is often affected bymy family concerns.&quot;    All respondents                                29%    Married with children                          39%    All professionals                              45%    Women under 35 with children                   53%   &quot;I am usually too tired or stressed from work toeffectively address my family's day-to-day problems.&quot;    Dual-earners with children                     30%    Women under 35 with children                   57%   &quot;I often don't have time for myself after meeting my workand/or family responsibilities.&quot;    Dual-earners with children                     68%    Women under 35 with children                   95%   Source: Work and Family Resources</TEXT></DOC>
