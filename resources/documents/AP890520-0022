An artistic and legal struggle ensued, followed by compromise.The revised version, unveiled at the Whitney Museum Friday, was aplain Zeus _ displayed with photos of his former self and signsexplaining the controversy.   It all started in 1930, when the Met bought a bronze replica ofthe Zeus, a famous relic from ancient Greece. Several years ago,the Met loaned the Zeus to the Queens Museum, which in turn loanedit to the Whitney.   Enter Spanish-born artist Francesc Torres, whose work titled``Oikonomos,'' the Greek word for economical, was commissioned forthe Whitney's Biennial Exhibition.   Torres envisioned a Zeus that symbolized ``the economicspectrum, the lowest and the highest: from guys who work at thecorner of Broadway and Houston cleaning windshields down to WallStreet.''   ``I wanted to use Zeus because, in Greek mythology, Zeus was thechairman of the board,'' Torres said.   This statue's right hand _ which traditionally holds a lightningbolt or javelin _ was empty. So Torres added a baseball bat,representing a threat to the economy.   Torres pointed Zeus' left hand toward a video projection screen,which showed a documentary of street people washing car windows forchange.   Perhaps the crux of the matter was a 3{-inch video monitor. Itwas hung from a piece of twine that was wrapped around the statue'swaist and looped around his genitals _ showing ``the chairman ofthe board being hindered by his own power,'' said Torres.   ``The monitor showed footage of the Stock Exchange from themezzanine. That was meshed with car racing material'' to compare acar crash and the stock market crash, he said.   The exhibit was opened April 27 and was seen by more than 25,500visitors.   On May 11, the Met's Department of Greek and Roman Art notifiedthe Whitney that it would take back its Zeus unless theaccoutrements were removed.   The Whitney closed the Zeus gallery May 12, took pictures of it,and opened the revised version Friday.   ``It's preposterous but also very fitting, because the piece isabout power,'' Torres said. ``That's precisely what has generatedas a result _ a power backlash.''   Dietrich von Bothmer, chairman of the Met's Department of Greekand Roman Art, did not return calls for comment.   But he told The New York Times earlier: ``Even if the statue isa reproduction, it is a reproduction of a work of art. The image isoriginal. Adding material to it changes the intent and I still feelthat universally acknowledged masterpieces of ancient art should betreated with the respect they deserve.''   ``They're saying we have betrayed the original intent of theartist. But who knows what the original intent of the artist was?''Torres said. ``There is one small gratification I'm getting out ofthis. I didn't think that in our blase world something like thiscould create such an uproar. We haven't lost all the ammunitionafter all.''</TEXT></DOC>
