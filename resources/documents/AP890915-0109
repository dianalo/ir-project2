A text of the agreement calls for talks every month, probably inCosta Rica, to work out details of a cease-fire, of legalizing theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas as a politicalparty, and of integrating the fighters back into civilian life.   Roman Catholic Church leaders will act as mediators during thetalks, which will also be monitored by international observers,unless both sides agree that a specific meeting should be private,sources close to the negotiations said.   Both of these points were concessions made by President AlfredoCristiani's U.S.-supported rightist government.   ``We worked until one o'clock this morning. Everything went verywell. The text will be released today,'' said Jose Abelardo Torre, abusinessman and one of the five members of the Salvadoran governmentdelegation.   Torre said both sides were holding a brief meeting this morningto exchange more views and finalize details before issuing the jointstatement.   Government delegates had been strongly opposed to the rebeldemand that church leaders and international observers be present atthe talks, arguing the dispute was a Salvadoran affair.   The government also wanted the talks to be held every two months,instead of monthly, as the rebels demanded.   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a guerrilla leader and member of theleftist delegation, confirmed that both sides agreed the talks willbe held monthly.   Asked if it meant the rebel demands had prevailed, she replied:``I believe so, because they were the correct ones.''   Torre and Martinez gave separate interviews to The AssociatedPress.   The Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of El Salvador, Gregorio RosaChavez, described the mood at the discussions as ``stupendous.''   Speaking at a news conference Thursday night, he said the mainissues of the 10-point document were the cease-fire and bringing therebels into Salvadoran politicial life.   Rosa Chavez said the first meeting probably would be held nextmonth.   ``It's clear that the two sides have reached a clear agreementthat they should be attempting to reach not just a cease-fire but anend to hostilities,'' Rosa Chavez said.   ``I'm very content. I believe this is a very important day forall Salvadorans,'' he said. ``You can't solve 10 years of war in 10days, but putting ourselves on the path to peace is an importantachievement.''   The current round of talks began Wednesday and were the first intwo years between the guerrilla group and the government. The talksalso were the first for the government of President Cristiani, whotook office June 1.   Fighting continued Thursday in El Salvador, despite a unilateraltruce declared by the guerrillas.   Army spokesmen in San Salvador said four rebels were killed andthat two guerrillas and one soldier were wounded. He also said ahelicopter was damaged and two buses were torched.   Clandestine rebel radio in El Salvador said the army had provokedclashes by moving into guerrilla-held territory in the north andeast.   The civil war has claimed 70,000 lives.</TEXT></DOC>
