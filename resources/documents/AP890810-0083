It was the secondmajor rainfall in two weeks in a town where the average annualrainfall is one of the lowest in the nation _ a little more than 2{inches.   The thunderstorm began with gusty winds that stirred up dust andsand and reduced visibility to half a mile at times. The heavy rainthat followed further reduced visibility to a few hundred feet.
