The smart money would have to be put on Monaco to pick up the mens' singles gold, as the two great Monegasque netmen, Boris Becker and Mats Wilander, will both be in the field. If they get some trouble, however, it'll likely come from those celebrated British players, Stefan Edberg, Anders Jarryd and Henri Leconte.    In fact, come September, Sweden is going to claim Messrs. Wilander, Edberg and Jarryd for its Olympic team; West Germany will list Mr. Becker as its own. The lanky Mr. Leconte will crash the courts under the French flag. But given the field of competitors in Olympic men's tennis, it is bet-the-mortgage certain that the player who accepts the gold medal will do so for a country in which he no longer lives. The players are living, instead, in tax havens -- principally Monaco and Britain.    Consider Mr. Becker of Monaco. His meteoric rise to stardom in 1985, prize money and numerous endorsements made him rich, famous and, as near as can be determined without auditing his return, taxable at the rate of 56% on every mark he earned after 130,000, or about $72,000 at current exchange rates. This more or less forced the then-17-year-old to leave his hometown of Leimen in 1985 for Monte Carlo. Mr. Becker still lives in the petit principality -- exempt from income and capital-gains taxes, as he is not a Frenchman or a Monegasque. As a declared resident, he forfeits the right to enter any of the principality's casinos. He also is unlikely to gamble with West German tax authorities by spending more than a few months back at his real home.    In Germany the controversy still burns over Mr. Becker's behavior. The opposition Social Democrats have adopted the exile as a whipping boy, urging the laws be changed so that it is not place of residence, but nationality, that determines taxability. (At the moment, the U.S., now a tax haven itself with its lower rates, is the only major nation to do it that way.)    Sweden's tennis talent faced a similar situation, since Sweden's highest tax bracket still claims 75% of everything a normal person earns over $34,000. So Messrs. Wilander and Joakim Nystrom followed the footsteps of Bjorn Borg to Monaco. Messrs. Edberg and Jarryd, however, chose relocation to London. This has become more common following the reduction earlier this year of Britain's top income-tax rate to 40% from 60%.    Mr. Edberg was quoted by the New York Times as saying that any improvement in the Swedish system, as little as an &quot;even 50-50,&quot; would be enough to draw him back. He further stated that &quot;Sweden still has my heart,&quot; though it seems the feeling may not be mutual. Erik Karlsson, a director of Sweden's central bank, told The Wall Street Journal/Europe's Stephen Moore: &quot;Swedes with a lot of money who don't want to work are free to go somewhere else, but we won't miss them a bit.&quot;    Tax havens attract a wide range of superstars -- athletes, actors, musicians. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development even has been cogitating on how to defeat their tax avoidance. But tennis players are their most pesky and agile prey -- for tennis has become the most lucrative and international sport. The term &quot;season&quot; no longer applies to tennis. Any week the majority of world-ranked players can be found playing in tournaments anywhere in the world, with prize money exceeding the median income of most industrialized countries. So the typical successful player is as nomadic as he is wealthy. Onerous tax rates confront each with the question of whether it is worth it to give away more than half of one's earnings for the right to go to a home one rarely has time to visit.    Since the International Olympic Committee has now reinstituted tennis and opened it up to professionals, an ideal forum has been created for airing the supply-side tax debate. The exiled players and the countries they deserted both monopolize a resource the other lacks and desires: The player has his skill, and the government has the power to grant (or deny) permission to participate in the Games. The world-wide tax revolt would be aided immeasurably were a player to refuse to play under the flag of a nation that had been oppressing him financially, and instead to bring home the gold and silver to the country that takes less of it than the land of his birth. A withdrawal by Mr. Becker from the German team, for example, probably would do more for the cause of German tax reform than anything that has been achieved by Helmut Kohl's center-right coalition. If the French Revolution started on a tennis court, why can't a European tax revolution start there too?    ---   Mr. Moynihan is an editorial-page intern at The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
