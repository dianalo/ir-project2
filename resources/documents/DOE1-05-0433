First, on-line coolant activity monitoring allows for nearreal-time qualitative or quantitative assessment of cladding defects,eliminating the time delay, personnel exposure and waste associated withthe collection of grab samples. The possibility of monitoring the fuelcondition during transients is also important for the plant operator.Due to the much greater number of activity measurements performed fora variety of nonvolatile, volatile and gaseous isotopes the accuracyof measured activities is improved. The prediction of defect characteristicssuch as type and size of the defect and its approximate location in thereactor core is also improved. For failure characterization the isotoicratios {sup 131}I/{sup 133}I, {sup 133}I/{sup 134}I, {sup 133}Xe/{sup135}Xe, {sup 87}Kr/{sup 135}Xe, {sup 138}Xe/{sup 135}, {sup 134}Cs/{sup137}Cs are important. An on-line fuel condition monitoring systems canbe incorporated into the Plant Anomaly Detection System, providing importantinformation to the plant operator on defect deterioration and thus assistingin plant operation and refueling strategy.</TEXT></DOC>
