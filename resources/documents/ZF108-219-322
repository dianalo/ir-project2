 Estimates from International Data Corp.,andO;Framingham, Mass., put the market for full text retrieval tools at $54million in 1988, to $72 million in 1989 to a projected $260 million in 1993.andM;While the market is dominated in revenue terms by Information Dimensions Inc.andO;(IDI), Dublin, Ohio, many small companies have a piece of the market, saidAnn Palermo, director of office systems research for IDC (see Figure 1).andO;&quot;Many full text retrieval vendors have turned the results of Department ofDefense research contracts into commercial software products,&quot; she said.andM;In making the judgment on tools, a critical consideration is the retrievalmethod.andP;  With machine-readable and accessible text information, end usersshould be able to search for and retrieve documents or sections of documents.andO;Four fundamental indexing methods support text retrieval:andM;* &quot;brute force&quot; search (no indexing);andM;* manual indexing;andM;* keyword indexing;andM;* and full text indexing.andM;The search of word processing files in a PC hard disk directory using a bruteforce search could be a sufficient retrieval method for the problem at hand.andO;The user supplies a query phrase and the software checks it against everyword in the files.andP;  Success is finding a matching pattern.andP;  Tools capable ofsuch queries include Gofer from Microlytics, East Rochester, N.Y., andMagellan from Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge, Mass., as well as popularword-processing packages, such as Word from Microsoft, Redmond, Wash., andWordPerfect from WordPerfect Corp., Orem, Utah.andM;Brute force search is an appropriate method for small document collections oftext that are modified and expanded often, and for collections that areunlikely to be searched often.andP;  For large collections of text, brute forcetools can become grossly inefficient.andM;If a textbase is indexed, searches on the document collections execute morerapidly.andP;  However, the trade-offs for speed are the time (and processingcosts) needed to generate the index and the extra disk storage that must beallocated to the retrieval system to store the index.andM;Book indexes are word abstractions that represent a book's major themes andparticulars.andP;  Different indexers would make different judgments about the keywords and phrases readers would search.andP;  Cross references can be used tohighlight these differences.andP;  Or, the index structure can accommodatesubordinate relationships.andP;  For example, the &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; entrymight have four subordinate topics: &quot;expert systems, machine vision, naturallanguage processing and robotics.&quot;andM;If the subordinate structure is not provided, the textbase user would have tosupply it.andP;  This requires a subject knowledge to identify categories andcategory relationships.andP;  In the pace of modern business, this can be aconstraint.andP;  (Or, for a firm with a solution, it could be a marketopportunity.)andM;When keyword indexing is used, the keywords selected must capture the essenceof the documents in the textbase.andP;  (The term &quot;keyword&quot; is used to representterms and phrases.)andP;  The author of the keywords faces the same problems asthe index author.andP;  The selection of retrieval keys requires a reasonabledegree of knowledge about the document's contents and the relatedprofessional field.andM;Because large volumes of text make up online or CD-ROM textbases, typicallymany different indexers are supplying the terms and phrases to the individualdocument records.andP;  Thus, the potential for retrieval chaos exists.andM;A CONTROLLED VOCABULARYandM;One solution is to create a controlled vocabulary, a list of terms andphrases which are &quot;legal&quot; to use in indexing.andP;  This prevents the use ofsynonymous terms, which can degrade the effectiveness of document retrieval.andM;While the creation of controlled vocabulary indexes may be labor-intensive,they take the burden of knowledge off the user.andP;  They can substantiallydeepen a user's understanding of an existing document collection.andM;Information Access Co., Foster City, Calif., a division of ZiffCommunications, publishes a controlled vocabulary, which lists some 600 pagesof indexing terms and phrases relating to information technology.andP;  The termsare a modified subset of a collection developed by the Library of Congressfor controlled vocabulary indexes.andM;Ziff Communications uses IAC's controlled vocabulary for classifyinginformation in the Computer Library, an information source available onCD-ROM which Ziff produces and distributes.andM;Most online textbases use file-inversion indexing.andP;  The inversion transformsa database of documents into an alphabetical list of its words.andP;  The liststores the locations of every instance of every word in the documentdatabase.andP;  Common words such as &quot;the&quot; are specified as &quot;stopwords&quot; andexcluded from indexing.andP;  All searches are carried out against this index.andM;Once the textbase is indexed, users can locate specific items by enteringqueries using words of interest expressed in the syntax of Boolean logic:AND, OR and NOT.andP;  For example, a query that said find (&quot;artificial ormachine&quot;) and &quot;intelligence&quot; would retrieve references to &quot;artificialintelligence&quot; and &quot;machine intelligence.&quot;andP;  It would also retrieve a documentwith a statement such as, &quot;One must have a high degree of 'intelligence'&quot; torepair a washing 'machine.'&quot;  More complex Boolean syntax can lessen thedifficulties.andM;Full text indexing has drawbacks.andP;  Each time the document collection ismodified, a new index for the collection must be created, albeit an automatedprocess.andP;  Also, the inverted file can require between 50% and 90% as muchstorage as the document collection to be indexed.andM;By storing occurrences of words as meaningless strings of characters--rawdata--inverted-file indexes fail to capture knowledge of categories.andM;In October 1989, Information Dimensions released Basisplus, designed to serveas the central depository for the entire corporation's information resource.andO;Basisplus offers a wide variety of user interfaces, supports compounddocument architecture, supports advanced content-based retrieval and complieswith the industry standards for document architecture, interchange andmarkup.andM;Basisplus uses relational DBMS technology and distributed processing toprovide information creation, storage, management and retrieval.andP;  IDI's othertext information product, Basis, and Basisplus permit documents to beaccessed via keywords or a full text search.andM;Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, uses Basis in the corporate records departmentfor fast and easy access to information regarding government regulatorycontrols, changing technology and legal and corporate concerns.andM;The firm is working with nine databases.andP;  Three are used by the legaldepartment to track litigation and patent information.andP;  The recordsmanagement department uses six databases to track research and recordsretention information.andP;  It also maintains an index to manufacturinginformation, lab and research notebooks, regulatory compliance documents andcompany historical and archival information.andM;Recently the department added IDI's Thesaurus module to its system tostandardize and control query vocabulary.andP;  This is important because drugproducts can change names before coming to market.andP;  By entering all the namesinto the system as synonyms in the Thesaurus, a search on any one name willturn up references to any of the names.andM;Cindy Strowig, corporate records manager, feels that one of the mostimportant advances is the ease of operation and training.andP;  Most of theiremployees are not familiar with computers and many have no keyboardfamiliarity.andP;  &quot;But no one has trouble using Basis.andP;  We have no problem doingour own updates and changes, even though we're not technical people,&quot; Strowigsaid.andM;Basis is currently running on a Wang VS system and the department is addingtwo new databases to its system this year.andP;  In the future, the firm wouldlike to link Basis to its Wang word processing and electronic mail packagesand provide direct links to satellite record center areas.andM;Basis runs on DEC VAX/VMS, MicroVAX/VMS and Ultrix; IBM VM/CMS, MVS/TSO; CDCCyber NOS/VE; Wang VS and various Unix midrange machines.andM;Topic, from Verity, Mountain View, Calif., bridges the invertedfile/Booleanretrieval systems and controlled vocabulary systems.andP;  Users can groupsynonymous or related search terms into searchable subject headings.andP;  Thesecan be related to each other using graphic structures--yielding &quot;topics.&quot;andO;These can be modified and combined into domains of interest.andM;To execute a query, a topic must be specified.andP;  Users can navigate the topicstructure to select desired terms or classes of terms.andP;  Users can combinethese terms using Boolean operations.andM;At every branch in the topic outline, the user has the option of assigning arating factor.andP;  Documents that match the words with higher factors would beweighted more in the overall relevance ranking.andP;  Documents retrieved this wayare presented in rank order of relevance.andP;  By virtue of this method, theproduct is said to achieve up to 95% retrieval accuracy.andM;To simplify the process of building a topic list, Topic offers atopic-by-example facility, which can automatically build a topic list basedon words a user highlights in a document.andP;  But, the construction of topicstakes time and requires significant knowledge of the subject.andM;According to IDC's Palermo, &quot;If an organization is willing to expend thesignificant effort required to define the topics, Verity's approach can beuseful.andP;  But frequently, users want information 'on the fly' rather thanplanning everything out beforehand.&quot;andM;A recently released version of Topic (Topic 2.0) includes new options forintegrating information into a Topic system.andP;  The SQL-Bridge can be used toaccess data in SQL-like relational database.andP;  The Topic real-time system(RTS) can be used to integrate dynamic data sources into a Topic database inrealtime.andM;Mitre Corp., a federally contracted research center in Bedford, Mass., usesthe Topic realtime system to integrate United Press International (UPI)reports with an existing Topic text search application.andM;Topic runs standalone or distributed in heterogeneous, networked computingenvironments.andP;  Written in C, Topic runs on Digital Equipment Corp. VAXprocessors, a variety of Unix midrange machines, and MS-DOS and Xenix-basedPCs.andP;  The product supports various networks, including NFS from SunMicrosystems, Mountain View, Calif., and NetWare from Novell, Provo, Utah.andM;Standard full text retrieval systems that employ standard inverted-fileindexing constitute the majority of systems today, but they have a number ofdrawbacks.andP;  These include: placing the burden of knowledge squarely on users;requiring knowledge of the subject to be searched and knowledge of Booleanoperators for conducting the search; and an inability to distinguish betweenrelevant and irrelevant material.andM;GOTO HYPERTEXT LINKSandM;Users often need to relate portions of retrieved text to other relevantinformation.andP;  Hypertext, in its most basic form, is a mechanism for linkingone passage of text to another that is somehow related.andP;  Hypertext is alogical extension of the core ideas involved in constructing controlledvocabularies for search systems.andM;A table of contents provides a &quot;map&quot; to the structure of a document andassists users in non-linear text navigation.andP;  Hypertext software toolssupport a similar relational knowledge by enabling textbase users to godirectly to related or complementary material.andM;However, hypertext links are analogous to GOTO statements in unstructuredprogram code, with all the associated maintenance problems.andP;  Hundreds orthousands of hypertex links in a document base would quickly lead to familiar&quot;spaghetti code.&quot;andM;In many search systems, category knowledge is supplied by users.andP;  Inhypertext systems, much of the knowledge required to retrieve information isembedded in the system itself.andP;  Hypertext implementations can vary from rigidto flexible in the degree to which they can be modified.andM;Moreover, highly individual connections created between concepts usinghypertext links can create more confusion than understanding.andP;  If therelational knowledge supplied by hypertext links does not reflect sharedassumptions, little or negative value would be added by the associations.andM;When the relational knowledge is based on shared assumptions--shared acrossan industry, professional association, corporate culture or departmentworkgroup--hypertext becomes a vehicle capable of conveying far moreinformation than paper documents or conventional databases.andM;IBM's Stairs, introduced over 20 years ago, was the first commercial searchand retrieval system.andP;  Developed from the need to access unstructured text inlitigation files, the system was based on keyword search technology.andM;Special-purpose hardware-based systems have been available.andP;  These includeTRW's Fast DataFinder and General Electric's GEScan, which apply the bruteforce method to text retrieval.andP;  The systems are fast, but range up to$250,000.andM;Through the 1960s and 1970s, a handful of text retrieval systems weredesigned and built around proprietary minicomputer- and mainframe-basedBoolean systems.andP;  IDI's Basis is an example.andM;PC-level search and retrieval systems range from simple word search routinesused in word processing programs, to standalone PC products such as AskSamfrom AskSam Systems, Perry, Fla., or Magellan from Lotus Development.andM;Products that allow users to build a profile of information, and that thensearch online databases to retrieve documents matching the profile, arelikely to gain marketplace momentum, IDC's Palermo predicted.andM;One such product is NewsEdge from Desktop Data, Waltham, Mass.andP;  It integratesup to seven news wires into one stream, transmits them into a micro via FMbroadcast and does a full text index in realtime.andP;  The stream is stored onthe hard disk.andP;  The news stories are managed by NewsEdge on a revolvingbasis, with the old ones deleted to make room for the newer ones.andM;The user can define how long stories should be retained, the limit beingdictated by the amount of hard disk available.andP;  The user can flag a story tobe clipped, which will store it in another area of the hard disk so it willnot be deleted.andP;  News stories can be printed and saved in Ascii for lateruser by a word processing package.andP;  Users can build a profile that containswords and phrases of interest.andP;  Users can terminate-stay-resident product,will match the profile against the stories as they &quot;stream&quot; into the PC.andM;The software flags those that match, sounds a beep and places a banner on thescreen.andP;  User can employ a hot-key to see the headline of the matched newsstory and scroll down through the items if desired.andP;  This is all withoutexiting the software package they were working on when NewsEdge flagged theitem.andM;The product ranges in price from $7,500 to $40,000 in annual fees, includingthe cost of the news feeds, a company spokesman said.andM;In addition, Palermo suggested that text management products will become lessof a discrete product over time.andP;  &quot;More and more, full text retrieval willbecome an integrated service, bundled into an office system,&quot; she said.andM;For example, IBM has bundled the SearchVision full text retrieval option intoits OfficeVision product.andP;  &quot;That's a statement that IBM considers full textretrieval a significant market,&quot; she said.andM;This feature is based on an upcoming book, Text Management, from the JamesMartin Productivity Series, Marblehead, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
