An alternativeapproach is to analyze large data sets consisting of heterogeneous groupsof chemicals and to explore QSAR's among these chemicals for generalizedpatterns of chemical behavior. The use of exploratory multivariate statisticaltechniques for simplifying complex QSAR problems is demonstrated throughthe use of research data on biodegradation and mode of toxic action.In these examples, a large number of explanatory variables were examinedto explore which variables might best explain whether a chemical biodegradesor whether a toxic response by an organism can be used to identify amode of toxic action. In both cases, the procedures reduced the numberof potential explanatory variables and generated hypotheses about biodegradationand mode of toxic action for future research without explicitly testingan existing hypothesis.</TEXT></DOC>
