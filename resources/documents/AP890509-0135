SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 3 million people from around theglobe have won a chance to take part in a computerized ``visalottery'' that will give 20,000 immigrants the opportunity to livein the United States, the State Department announced Tuesday.   ``The so-called `visa lottery' is now over _ 3.2 million peopleapplied successfully,'' department spokesman Richard Boucher toldreporters.   Boucher said winners will be chosen by a computer which willmake the selections on a random basis.   Citizens from 162 countries were eligible to apply during Marchand all applicants have an equal chance of winning an immigrantvisa.   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., author of the legislation thatmade the new program possible, ``will open the first fewapplication envelopes selected by the computer and announce thenationalities of the applicants'' at a ceremony Monday, Bouchersaid.   ``He will be the first person to match the computer numbers withthe (application) envelopes,'' said Frances Jones, an official withthe department's counsular affairs office.   Only the nationalities and not the names will be announced atthe ceremony ``as a courtesy'' to the privacy of the applicants,Ms. Jones said.   Those who do win a visa and come to the United States couldapply for citizenship later if they meet the strict criteria forthat status, Ms. Jones added.   Under the program, 10,000 visas will be granted each year for1991 and 1992.   Berman said the program would bring diversity to the immigrantpopulation.   Under the normal rules for obtaining an immigrant visa, theapplicant has to have a close relative in the United States or workin a scarce profession.   The program touched off a near-tempest at posts around theworld, primarily because it opened the way for nearly anyone tocome the United States.   Since the program was announced in February, U.S. embassies anddiplomatic posts overseas were besieged with queries.   Telephones rang constantly and embassy entry ways were snarledat posts ranging from Cairo, Egypt, to Bucharest, Romania, aspeople lined up for information.   But winning the lottery doesn't automatically gain applicantsentry _ they must also meet the basic requirements for entry, suchas good health and no criminal contacts.   The last lottery for visas was held in 1986. It was morerestrictive than the current program and allowed only 10,000 visas,with some 1.4 million applicants losing out.   The countries excluded from the program were those that usedmore than 5,000 immigrant slots in fiscal 1988.   They were China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador,Guyana, Haiti, India, Jamaica, South Korea, Mexico, the Philippinesand the United Kingdom.   Also excluded were natives of Taiwan, Anguilla, Bermuda, BritishVirgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, HongKong, Monteserrat, Pitcairn, St. Helena, and the Turks and CaicosIslands.</TEXT></DOC>
