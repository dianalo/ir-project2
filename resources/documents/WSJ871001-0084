MitchellStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MANINSURANCE (INS)FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN><TEXT>   Manville Corp., reacting to customer concern over the safety of its glass fiber products, said it will indemnify buyers against any future health claims.    The Denver-based building and forest products concern, which sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection five years ago after being flooded with health and property damage claims over its asbestos-related products, also beefed up its glass fiber product labeling and issued its own guidelines for workplace exposure levels, for which there aren't any federal standards.    Manville, saying the move &quot;isn't a preemptive strike,&quot; stressed that it sees no potential liability problem with its glass fiber products and hasn't set aside any reserves in anticipation of claims. But it said customers' concerns over the products' safety have heightened following recent studies. While a study released this summer by the World Health Organization reported that fiberglass workers didn't show a higher-than-normal rate of lung cancer, some studies where animals were implanted with the fiber showed tumor formation.    &quot;We haven't seen business decline or heard a large hue and cry, but there's real caution on the part of customers,&quot; a Manville spokesman said. &quot;They've been asking the question, 'What happens if we get sued if somebody thinks they have a problem with it.' This is just a way of reinforcing the message that fiberglass is safe.&quot;    The company's fiberglass products group is its largest, and has posted several quarters of sales and operating profit increases. In the six months ended June 30, sales of fiberglass products increased 9.1% to $423.1 million from $387.7 million. Operating profit rose 44% to $76.2 million from $52.9 million. In the same period, Manville earned $84 million, or 2.98 a share, compared with $46 million, or $1.39 a share a year earlier. Sales were $992.9 million, compared with $925.9 million.    Manville appears to be the first fiberglass-product producer to take such a step, which surprised some executives in the insurance and fiberglass industries. But Edward Hamilton, a toxic-tort consultant, said the move wasn't too unusual given companies' concern over the prospect that they may be sitting on a toxic powder keg that is now deemed safe but that might be found harmful down the road. Asbestos, for example, was once widely used in piping and insulation but was found to cause deadly lung diseases and cancers that often don't show up for years. Manville and other former asbestos-related concerns now face huge health and property damage liabilities from asbestos-related lawsuits.    &quot;People are more or less feverishly trying to work out techniques to deal with these events should they occur,&quot; he said.    Mr. Hamilton noted that because product liability law can find at fault anyone from producer to distributor who handled the product, insulation installers and handlers with much smaller resources than Manville could easily be wiped out by successful lawsuits. That would also leave Manville paying most of the tab.    &quot;They're trying to pull the teeth from a very serious inhibitor to selling the products,&quot; Mr. Hamilton said. &quot;It turns a situation -- which would turn out bad for them anyway -- into a business advantage. That is, I think given their history, a wise business move.&quot; Manville said it didn't plan to boost prices for its products because of its indemnity offer, which will be covered by Manville's insurers. </TEXT></DOC>
