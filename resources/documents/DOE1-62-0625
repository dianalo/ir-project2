The exchangecapacity and moisture content decreased, the maximum effect was in thecase of Cu/sup ++/ form of the resin. The data are explained on the basisof metal oxygen bonding. IR spectra indicated the formation of new exchangesites upon irradiation and disapearance of the original functional groups.</TEXT></DOC>
