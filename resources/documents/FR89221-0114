Eppinger, Chief, BiomechanicsDivision (NRD-13), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400_7thStreet, SW., Room 6226, Washington, DC 20590; (202) 366-4875.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background and Objectives</ITAG>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is mandated with theresponsibility for devising strategies to save lives and reduce injuriesfrom motor vehicle crashes. The purpose of this cooperative agreement programis to promote the improvement of traffic safety for the public throughthe support of research studies designed to evaluate the biomechanicalresponse of human surrogates to impact as a means of expanding the baseof scientific knowledge in this field and to provide for the coordinatedexchange of scientific information collected as a result of the studiesconducted.Impact trauma research employs the principles of mechanics to discoverthe physical response and physiological results of impacts to the humanbody. Generally, the teams doing the research are comprised of individualsfrom different disciplines: engineering, physiology, medicine, biology,and anatomy. The team studies the physical response of the body to impactby measuring and recording engineering parameters defining the event, suchas force, accelerations, displacements, strains, pressure, etc., and observingthe physiological consequences in terms of physical or functional alterationsto the body.The major research materials used to stimulate the injury to the livinghuman are human cadavers and/or anesthetized animals (hereinafter referredto as human surrogates) exposed to impact and detailed response measurement.The focus of this cooperative research effort is to study of human surrogateresponse and injury to physical impacts simulating some significant aspectof automotive impact injury, i.e., head, neck, and/or torso injury producedin drivers and/or passengers, restrained by various safety devices andexposed to either a frontal, lateral, or rear impact; pedestrian trauma,etc. The specific objectives of this cooperative research effort are to:(1) Delineate the mechanisms of injury, (2) develop functional relationshipsbetween the measurable engineering parameters and the extent and severityof injury, and (3) quantify the impact response of the body in such a wayas to allow the development of mechanical analogs of the human body.<ITAG tagnum="84">NHTSA Involvement</ITAG>NHTSA, Biomechanics Division, will be involved in all activities undertakenas part of the cooperative agreement program and will:1. Provide, on an as-available basis, one professional staff person, tobe designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR),to participate in the planning and management of the cooperative agreementand coordinate activities between the organization and NHTSA.2. Make available information and technical assistance from governmentsources, within available resources and as determined appropriate by theCOTR.3. Provide liaison with other government agencies and organizations asappropriate; and4. Stimulate the exchange of ideas and problems among cooperative agreementrecipients, and, if appropriate, NHTSA contractors and other interestedparties.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Support</ITAG>The research effort described in this notice will be supported throughthe award of at least one cooperative agreement. NHTSA reserves the rightto make multiple awards depending upon the merit of the applications received.Contingent upon the availability of funds and satisfactory performance,cooperative agreement(s) will be awarded to eligible organization(s) forproject periods of up to two years. No cooperative agreement awarded asa result of this notice shall exceed $500,000.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility Requirements</ITAG>In order to be eligible to participate in this cooperative agreement program,an applicant must be an educational institution or other nonprofit researchorganization.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application Procedure</ITAG>Each applicant must submit one original and two copies of their applicationpackage to: Office of Contracts and Procurement (NAD-30), NHTSA, 400_7thStreet, SW., Room 5301, Washington, DC 20590. Only complete applicationpackages received on or before April 12, 1989, shall be considered. Submissionof three additional copies will expedite processing; but is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application Contents</ITAG>The application package must be submitted with a Standard Form 424 (rev.4-88), which shall include the certified assurances, and provide the following:1. A description of the research to be pursued which addresses:a. The objectives, goals, and anticipated outcomes of the proposed researcheffort;b. The method or methods that will be used;c. The source of the human surrogates to be used;d. The number and type of human surrogates (viz human cadavers or anesthetizedanimals) the applicant expects to use for this two-year research effortalong with documentation (retrospective or prospective) that provides evidencethat the applicant has access to the proposed quantity of experimentalmaterial.2. The proposed program director and other key personnel identified forparticipation in the proposed research effort, including a descriptionof their qualifications and their respective organizational responsibilities.3. A description of the general, as well as specialized impact simulation,test facilities and equipment currently available or to be obtained foruse in the conduct of the proposed research effort.4. A description of the applicant's previous experience or on-going researchprogram that is related to this proposed research effort.5.

The protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects in NHTSA-sponsoredexperiments is established in NHTSA Orders 700-1, 700-3, and 700-4. Anyrecipient must satisfy the requirements and guidelines of the NHTSA Orders700 series prior to award of the cooperative agreement. A copy of the NHTSAOrders 700 series may be obtained from the information contact designatedin this notice.2. Reporting Requirements:a. <T3>Data Reports: </T3>The dynamic and other data measured in each humansurrogate impact test will be provided by the recipient(s) within four(4) weeks after the test is run. For each and every test performed witha human surrogate, a data package shall be submitted to the COTR. For example,were a cadaver to be impacted by pendulum to the right femur and laterto be impacted by pendulum to the thorax, the two (2) impacts are separatetests even though there was only one (1) human surrogate.A data package consists of high speed film, ``paper'' test report, andmagnetic tape complying with NHTSA Data Tape Reference Guide. NHTSA, BiomechanicsDivision, maintains a Biomechanical Data Base which provides information,upon request, to the public, including educational institutions and otherresearch organizations.To facilitate the input of data as well as the exchange of information,any recipient of a cooperative agreement awarded as a result of this noticemust provide the magnetic tape in the format specified in the ``NHTSA DataTape Reference Guide,'' dated August, 1985, with about twenty insert pagesdated December, 1985.
