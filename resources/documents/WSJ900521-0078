To bolster the case, the National Coalition to PreventImpaired Driving, a group of more than 100 traffic-safety andpublic-health organizations, is holding a press conferencetoday to promote a new report, &quot;Beer and Fast Cars: HowBrewers Target Blue-Collar Youth.&quot; The study concludes thatbeer companies spend about $50 million a year &quot;in asophisticated campaign to strengthen associations betweenbeer, cars and speed in a demographic group at elevated riskof drinking and driving.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The coalition wants beer companies to drop theirmotor-sports sponsorships voluntarily, and non-brewers topick up the sponsorships. If the brewers don't move, thegroups vow to campaign for a legislative ban.   The attack is the latest public-relations headache for anindustry that in recent years has come under increasingcriticism for allegedly targeting young people, blacks andHispanics. James Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, atrade association, calls the groups' complaint &quot;ridiculous.&quot;He says it &quot;reached an absurd level that defies commonsense.&quot;   But the report's author, David Buchanan, an assistantprofessor at the University of Massachusetts school of publichealth, contends that the beer industry, faced with decliningconsumption by health-conscious, white-collar Americans, istargeting blue-collar youth involved in the car culture.&quot;This target group is accurately perceived by the industry toinclude the largest number of heavy beer drinkers,&quot; he says.   At the same time, Prof. Buchanan says, young males fromblue-collar backgrounds are at disproportionately higher riskof being killed in alcohol-related crashes.   The report, financed by the AAA Foundation for TrafficSafety and produced by California's Marin Institute, anonprofit research and advocacy group, finds that motorsports, which include drag racing, motorcycle racing and&quot;monster-truck&quot; competitions, receive more sponsorship moneyfrom the beer industry than any other type of sport.   &quot;Beer companies are saturating motor events,&quot; says MichaelSchriefer, a pro race-car driver from Manhattan Beach, Calif.&quot;It's giving the young the wrong impression.&quot;   Typically, motor-sport events are festooned with banners,bunting and posters decorated with the name of the beersponsor, and feature several beer-dispensing booths. Someevents have emcees who periodically urge spectators to buybeer. Beer companies sometimes underwrite an entire event,and other times sponsor individual teams or drivers.   Randi Lynn Hubbard, one of the few female monster-truckdrivers in the U.S., says there is so much beer consumed atsome events that she worries about the fans getting homesafely.   The report recommends that if an outright ban on beersponsorships is politically unfeasible, other steps should betaken, such as limiting the cup size for beer sales to 12ounces and halting sales at least one hour before an eventends.   In reply, Stephen Burrows, vice president for consumerawareness at Anheuser-Busch Cos., calls the report&quot;pseudoscience&quot; based on opinion, not fact.   &quot;We've determined that racing is a good place to reach ouraudience, which is adults over 21,&quot; Mr. Burrows says. He addsthat &quot;to conclude that people who wear blue jeans and go toracing events are drunk drivers is an insult to people whoenjoy racing events.&quot; Moreover, he notes that Anheuser-Buschhas spent millions on its &quot;Know When to Say When&quot; adcampaign, designed to foster responsibility among theconsuming public.   None of that is likely to mollify critics who argue thatthe industry is targeting specific segments of society thatmay be more vulnerable to alcohol abuse than others.   Spring break, for example, remains a controversy. AtTexas's South Padre Island, a favorite gathering spot forcollege students, the beer companies this year &quot;weren'thanding out beer, but they had displays, and they sponsoredall kinds of beach games,&quot; says Bobby Heard, a spokesman forTexans' War on Drugs, which is headquartered in Austin. &quot;Wedon't want them involved in spring break at all.&quot;   Pat Taylor, director of the alcohol policies project atthe Center for Science in the Public Interest, says beercompanies should be banned from sponsoring rockband toursbecause of their potential appeal to young people. She's alsoconcerned about malt-liquor advertising targeted to blacksand Hispanics.   Beer-industry officials say such concerns are misguided.&quot;No studies have ever related these marketing or advertisingactivities to an increase or decrease in alcohol abuse,&quot; saysthe Beer Institute's Mr. Sanders. Rather, executives say,these marketing tools promote a specific product amongconsumers who already have decided to drink.   Brewers say the criticism of the industry's marketingtechniques comes from a group of activists who have apaternalistic attitude toward the rest of the country. &quot;Webelieve the American public is smarter than these groups givethem credit for,&quot; says Anheuser-Busch's Mr. Burrows.</TEXT></DOC>
