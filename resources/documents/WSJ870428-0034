Chiles, the company's chairman and founder, will step down as president and chief executive officer effective May 1.    The oil-field services concern said Sheldon R. Erikson, formerly president of Joy Petroleum Equipment Co. in Houston, will succeed Mr. Chiles as president and chief executive. Mr. Erikson, 44 years old, was also named to Western Co.'s board, increasing the number of directors to nine.    The company said it has been seeking a successor to Mr. Chiles, 76, for several months. Mr. Chiles had returned as chief executive in June 1985 to help the troubled company restructure its finances; he originally stepped down in 1981. The company, which was battered by the plunge in the level of drilling activity, is negotiating with some of its lenders to restructure its debt.    Mr. Chiles will stay on as chairman and continue to &quot;bring his experience and contacts within the industry and make those available as needed,&quot; a company spokesman said. Mr. Chiles founded Western in 1939 and is part-owner of the Texas Rangers American League baseball club. Last year, an attempt to sell the team was blocked by the other league owners. </TEXT></DOC>
