Earlier, the Sunday Post newspaper in Scotland quoted a formerhigh-ranking Israeli intelligence agent as saying he believes AbuIbrahim, head of a Palestinian group, planned the Dec. 21 bombing,which killed 270 people.   ABC News, citing unidentified U.S. and Western intelligencesources, reported Monday that several dozen intelligence agents fromthe Palestine Liberation Organization are working with Pan Am on theinvestigation of the bombing.   PLO leader Yasser Arafat had pledged his group's help in theinvestigation, and ABC quoted its sources as saying the PLO's helphas been exceedingly valuable.   Transport Secretary Paul Channon said passes will be issued onlyto airport employees or to outside companies ``which the airportmanager is satisfied are reliable and reputable.''   ``Clearly, some of the firms in this field in the past have beenfar from reliable,'' he said in a statement.   Channon said cleaners and other airport workers now will have tohave held security passes for at least six months before beingallowed unsupervised access to aircraft and checked-in baggage.   He also praised the ``swift action'' of the British AirportsAuthority in withdrawing access to airplanes from two privatelyowned cleaning companies at Heathrow.   Graham Dudman of the Daily Express and Stewart Norris of LondonWeekend Television, working independently, told Friday how they gotjobs as airplane cleaners at Heathrow using fake applications.   They said that with passes issued by the two cleaning companiesinvolved, they were able to wander on and off a dozen jets wherethey said they could easily have planted a bomb.   New York-bound Flight 103 was destroyed by a bomb over theScottish village of Lockerbie, killing 259 people on the plane and11 on the ground.   The flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and baggage andpassengers were transferred to the Boeing 747 at Heathrow.   In Glasgow, the Sunday Post newspaper quoted former Mossadofficer Raphael Eitan as saying he had ``no doubt'' the bombers wereIbrahim's May 15 Palestinian group, based in Baghdad, Iraq, and thatthe bomb was made there and probably carried on board the plane byan unwitting accomplice.   The May 15 group, named for the date the 1948 Arab-Israel warstarted, also has offices in Syria and Libya, the newspaper quotedEitan as saying.   ``They are led by Abu Ibrahim, a qualified engineer. In the earlydays Ibrahim received all his financial support from Iraqiintelligence, who continue to provide him with cash and premises,''Eitan was quoted as saying.   ``May 15 has only 20 to 30 operatives who concentrate theirterrorist efforts on passenger airlines.''   May 15 was the only Palestinian group operating that way and withthe expertise to carry out such attacks, Eitan was quoted as saying.``Ibrahim spent five years designing and perfecting the device whichexploded over Lockerbie.   ``Ibrahim's detonator is so small it fits into the lock of thesuitcase. The explosive is made of plastic ... (which) is extremelythin and looks like computer printout paper so it is easilyconcealed.''   ``In the past four years he has failed several times to carry outa similar atrocity. In 1984, British and West German intelligenceintercepted five suitcases packed with explosives which May 15intended to plant on unsuspecting airline passengers. Two were foundin London, two were found in Frankfurt.''   Nothing in the interview attributed a motive to Ibrahim.</TEXT></DOC>
