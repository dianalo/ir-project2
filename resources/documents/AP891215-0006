The USDA projects some improvement in net cash income offarmers, perhaps to around $54 billion or so, compared with anestimated $53 billion this year.   Net cash income is the money farmers have left over from grosscash earnings after paying cash expenses.   Department economists also predict 1990 increases in farmlandprices, farm assets and equity values, which are importantindicators of financial condition.   ``Overall, the financial condition of farmers is stronger nowthan at any other time in the last several years,'' says thedepartment's Economic Research Service. ``This is largely due tocautious investment behavior, effective cost control, increasedcash financing, and continued restructuring and write-offs ofoutstanding debt.''   The American Bankers Association said its survey of 60 bankersat the group's annual conference last month in St. Louis, Mo.,indicated optimism for the rural economy in 1990. Sixty percentsaid they were optimistic about the outlook for the rural economy.Eight percent said it would worsen.   In general, the bankers said they believe farmers next year``will plant more acreage, use fewer chemicals, sell more productsto foreign markets, sign up for more crop insurance and increasetheir use of computers'' for their records.   About 48 percent of the bankers responding to the survey saidcompetition from other banks and the Farm Credit System would bethe biggest issue for them in 1990. Rural development was secondwith 28 percent.   The bankers were not so optimistic about the use of the FarmersHome Administration's guaranteed loan program. Half said theyexpect to make fewer FmHA-guaranteed loans next year, while 25percent said they expected an increase and 25 percent no change.   ``The results apparently reflect the bankers' concerns over whatthey consider to be the burdensome paperwork involved in theprogram,'' the association said.   But when it comes to ending federal subsidies to farmers, 67percent of the bankers said they were opposed to scrapping thepayments.   ``Nearly all of the bankers surveyed (95 percent) said, so far,they have not had to pay for cleanup costs on environmentallycontaminated collateral or property,'' the association reported.``Likewise, a majority (93 percent) of the bankers said animalrights laws have not affected whether they would make a loan.''   The American Bankers Association calls itself ``the nationaltrade and professional association for America's commercial banksof all sizes. Assets of ABA member banks are about 95 percent ofthe industry total.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Republic of Singapore has produced itsfirst litter of test-tube pigs, a step the island nation hopes willlead to a supply of genetically superior swine for Southeast Asia.   A report by the Agriculture Department's trade officer inSingapore said the potential market for such breeder pigs isestimated at 1.8 million sows, or $270 million, in Southeast Asiaalone.   ``Companies in Britain, Australia and the United States haveexpressed a keen interest in using Singapore as an agrotechnologyservice base,'' the report said.   Singapore is eliminating traditional methods of pork production,which require extensive land use and create pollution.   ``The birth of the piglets marks the beginning of efforts tomodernize production and to create a stock of elite, geneticallysuperior breeding pigs, which can be built up for mass productionthroughout the region,'' the report said.   Veterinary surgeons implanted a surrogate sow with donatedembryos last spring, resulting in the birth of seven offspring inSeptember.   The report said the surrogate mother can be adapted to localconditions, allowing her to pass on antibodies to local diseases toher young. Because the risk of disease is reduced, the chance ofsurvival is increased.   Also, the cost of transporting embryos is less expensive thanlive animals, and disease transmission is minimized.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union bought U.S. poultry meat thisyear for the first time in a decade, but Agriculture Departmentanalysts say the future potential of the Soviet market is uncertain.   Sale of 33 million pounds of broiler ``leg quarters'' this fallwas the first since 1980, and that one was halted by the partialembargo ordered by then-President Carter in retaliation for theSoviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.   Thus, said the department's Economic Research Service, there hadnot been actual shipments of U.S. poultry meat to the Soviet Unionsince 1977.   ``Broader Soviet policies toward providing consumer goods andU.S. prices relative to European broiler prices will be among thefactors influencing future sales,'' the agency said. ``Russiatraditionally imports poultry meat from Eastern European countries,primarily Hungary, and is expected to continue such arrangements.''   In 1988, Hungary exported almost 70 percent of the estimated 395million pounds of poultry imported by the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
