The survey, conducted by the American Medical Association andpublished today, asked doctors: ``Would you favor or opposewithdrawing life-support systems, including food and water, fromhopelessly ill or irreversibly comatose patients if they or theirfamilies request it?''   Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed answered ``favorstrongly,'' 20 percent ``favor,'' 5 percent ``oppose,'' 10 percent``oppose strongly'' and 7 percent ``unsure.''   One thousand randomly selected physicians in various specialtiesresponded to the survey, which was published in the AMA weekly,American Medical News.   Of those physicians, 67 percent said they have been directlyinvolved in treating a patient where the issue of refusing orwithdrawing life-sustaining treatment arose.   ``While physicians should never directly cause death, they mustalways act in the best interest of their patients, and thatsometimes includes allowing them to die,'' said Dr. James H.Sammons, executive vice president of the Chicago-based AMA.   Dr. James Childress, a medical ethics professor at theUniversity of Virginia, said he perceived a shift towardconsidering cost when deciding whether to continue life-sustainingtreatment.   ``During the time of the Karen Ann Quinlan case in themid-1970s, there was a greater risk of overtreatment. But now withpressures of cost containment, patients may be in danger ofundertreatment,'' Childress said in a telephone interview Wednesday.   Added Vaux, ``The danger is we'll start to do people in beforethey're ready to die.''   In the case of Miss Quinlan, who became comatose in 1975, theNew Jersey Supreme Court affirmed the individual's right to diewith dignity and permitted authorities to remove a respirator in1976. She died in 1985.   The survey also showed 54 percent of the physicians wereuncertain of the legal risks and responsibilities surrounding adecision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, while 43 percentsaid they were certain.   Ninety percent said doctors should initiate discussions withpatients or families on the use or withdrawal of life-supporttreatment, while 7 percent said they should not.   No margin of error was given for the survey.   Vaux said the survey implies doctors are ``returning to a moreancient attitude of accompanying the person to the death.''   ``Being willing to withdraw life support when the patient asksfor it or when no further medical remedies exist _ that's anexpression of fidelity to a patient,'' he said.   Still, physicians must not always follow a patient's request,said Dr. Nancy Dickey, a member of the AMA's Council on Ethical andJudicial Affairs.   ``If medical science can correct the basic problem so that thepatient returns to a good quality of life, then it might beinappropriate for a physician to listen to a patient who is askinghim to do nothing,'' she said.   In a separate survey in February, the AMA polled 1,500 peopleselected at random from telephone listings.   Fifty-six percent said they had told family members their wishesconcerning the use of life-sustaining treatment if they entered airreversible coma. Just 15 percent said they had filled out aliving will specifying those wishes.   The physicians surveyed, also in February, were selectedrandomly from the AMA's files of all active U.S. doctors. Theyincluded AMA members and non-members and physicians of both sexesand various ages.</TEXT></DOC>
