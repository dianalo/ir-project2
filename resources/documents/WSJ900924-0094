The legislation, approved last December after more than 17years of wrangling, will concentrate authority in thecommission to clear the largest European crossborder mergers,according to EC competition laws.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There is now a clear division of responsibility betweenthe European Commission and the member states for assessingmergers and takeovers,&quot; said Sir Leon Brittan, the ECcommissioner for competition affairs.   &quot;It will be a simpler world for business, which will nolonger face the multiple jeopardy of seeking clearance forsuch deals both from Brussels and from national capitals.&quot;   But experts say the law also gives the commission moreteeth and stricter standards than it had in the past toenforce EC competition rules.   That could mean that some agreements made in the pastwouldn't be approved under the new rules.   Under the law, the EC Commission will examine largemergers for their impact on competition in the EC. It will beempowered to change, suspend, or block mergers that hurtcompetition or create a company with a dominant position.   Mergers in which the companies involved have combinedrevenues of 5 billion European currency units ($6.55billion), of which at least two of the parties each have 250million Europen currency units in EC sales, will be reviewedby the commission.   Smaller transactions will be referred back to nationalauthorities.   Those thresholds can be reviewed in 2 1/2 years.   The new law requires companies to notify the commission ofmerger plans within one week of their agreement orannouncement, providing detailed information in thenotification. The commission must notify a company within onemonth whether it will oppose the merger.   Merger specialists say the new procedures shouldfacilitate cross-border acquisitions by creating a clear pathfor getting them approved, eliminating potential conflictsamong national authorities and between EC and national laws.   &quot;The advantages outweigh the uncertainties,&quot; said CarterEltzroth, a lawyer with the Brussels office of law firmMorgan Lewis Bockius, based in Philadelphia. &quot;It gets rid ofthe risk of conflicting decisions.&quot;   Lawyers also praised the emphasis on economic, rather thansocial or political considerations, in assessing mergers'impact.   &quot;When big deals were going on in recent years, peoplewould be saying to one another `Wish we had the EC law now,'&quot;said Donald Holley, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen andamp;Hamilton, a New York law firm with a Brussels office.   But the law also toughens the benchmark the commission canuse for blocking a merger. In the past, under EC case law,the commission could only intervene in mergers where one ofthe concerns had a dominant position before the merger.   A dominant position was flexibly defined as a 40% marketshare under EC case law.   Under the new legislation, the commission will be able toblock a merger that would create a dominant position.   &quot;Before, one of the companies would have needed a 40%&quot; toprompt action by the commission, said Cleary Gottlieb's Mr.Holley. &quot;Now if the two have 40%&quot; the commission canintervene, he said.   Experts say the amount of information companies mustprovide at the time a merger is announced will be greaterthan the requirements companies face now, or that companiesface in the U.S.   The initial notification &quot;is a bother, and sometimes anexpensive bother,&quot; one lawyer said.   Nonetheless, experts gave the commission high marks forits efforts to gear up to its new task.   &quot;They have good people in the sector and have made anextraordinary effort to be prepared,&quot; Mr. Holley said.</TEXT></DOC>
