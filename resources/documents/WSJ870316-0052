The Labor Department's producer price index for finished goods edged up 0.1% last month as the rise in energy prices slowed and food prices fell. In January, the index jumped 0.6%, reflecting a 9.8% surge in energy prices.    Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board said the output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.5% last month after revised increases of 0.1% in January and 0.5% in December. The Fed previously said production rose 0.4% in January and 0.3% in December.    The sharp February rebound, however, was dominated by a big increase in motor vehicle production, and the Fed said auto company production schedules suggest output is falling this month.    In a third report, the Commerce Department said business inventories rose a sharp 0.9% in January after falling a revised 0.6% in December. The increase was the largest since a 1.7% rise in July 1979.    The reports &quot;are consistent with an economy growing at a still relatively subdued pace,&quot; said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. &quot;The January price increase was an aberration on the up side and February is a corrective aberration on the down side. We're still left with very moderate inflation for finished goods in the industrial sector.&quot;    Joel Popkin, president of Joel Popkin andamp; Co. here, said, &quot;Our view is that the economy is basically flat in the first half. This is the kind of price performance that goes with that.&quot;    Both economists noted that low inflation is often a side effect of moderate growth.    &quot;This is a very, very good number overall,&quot; Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, said of the price report. She said she had been expecting &quot;something a good deal larger.&quot;    Although the rise in energy prices slowed last month, it still dominated the overall increase. Energy prices rose 4% after a 9.8% increase in January. Within the category, gasoline was up 5.5% after a 15.7% increase, fuel oil up 3% after a 18% jump, and natural gas up 1.8% after a 4.2% rise. Food prices fell 0.5% after declining 1.8% in January.    Excluding energy and food, prices fell 0.3% in February after rising 0.4% in January. Many economists contend this measure gives a better picture of underlying inflationary trends. The Labor Department said prices fell sharply for passenger cars and light trucks, reflecting expanded factory-financed rebate and loan-discount programs.    Prices rose for tobacco products, household furniture and glassware and flatware, among other items.    Primarily reflecting the lower motorvehicle prices, capital equipment prices fell 0.3% in February after rising 0.2% in January.    The department's price index for intermediate goods rose 0.5% in February after surging 0.9% the month before. In both months energy prices dominated the increases. Prices of crude goods rose 1.8% after a 2.9% rise; the slowdown was largely due to energy.    The figures in all three reports are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment, producer prices in February rose 0.2% to 292.3% of their 1967 average and stood 0.1% above a year earlier.    In the production report the Fed said the increase in auto output boosted production of both consumer goods, which rose 0.6% after a 0.3% drop in January, and business equipment, which increased 1% after a 0.3% rise. Output of home goods, such as appliances and furniture, also rose; the Fed said production of these items has been quite strong over the past six months.    Production of many types of business equipment other than autos remained weak, however. Mr. Dederick said that, excluding autos, &quot;we're talking about small increases&quot; in industrial production.    Many economists, however, expect production to turn up if, as they assume, the trade deficit improves. Mr. Dederick noted that the small increases of recent months are better than the declines that occurred in several months last year.    Output by manufacturers rose 0.5% in February after a 0.1% rise in January. Mining output gained 0.1% after a 1.6% rise, and utility production increased 0.7% after a 1.2% rise. The production of materials was up 0.2% after a 0.1% increase.    The Fed's industrial production index stood at 127.3% of its 1977 average and was 1.7% above a year earlier.    The inventory rise brought the ratio of inventories to sales to 1.38 in January from 1.31 in December, the Commerce Department said. Sales fell 4.5% to $428.75 billion after increasing 3% to $448.82 billion the month before. Many economists predict that inventories will continue to grow this quarter after falling last quarter.    In January, retail inventories rose 1.3% after a 1.2% decline in December. Inventories of wholesalers also increased 1.3% after a 0.3% drop. Manufacturers' inventories increased 0.5% after a 0.3% decline.    Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production in February.
