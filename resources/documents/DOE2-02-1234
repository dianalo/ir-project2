A second label, /sup153/Gd, provided for monitoring of procedures and for estimation of the/sup 235/U content of live eggs. Depositions of /sup 235/U were greaterthan for /sup 153/Gd in all tissues except the yolk sac and the liver.Skeletal levels for /sup 235/U were age- and sex-dependent. Featherscontained only 0.11% of the /sup 235/U tracer in contrast to 50% of theendogenous uranium. The results show that /sup 235/U provides for tracinguranium metabolism in small animals, since in quail the tracer increasedthe uranium burden of the body by only 1-8%.</TEXT></DOC>
