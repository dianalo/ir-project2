Does Dallas hang first, and ask questions later?   Randall Dale Adams, Martin Kimsey, Joyce Ann Brown, MichaelAnthony Woten and Stephen Lynn Russell would agree; they spent atotal of 44 years in prison before courts or the governor decidedthey never should have been sent there.   But prosecutors say the county is getting a bum rap, and manydefense lawyers say Dallas differs from other justice systems onlyin the celebrity of its wrongfully convicted prisoners.   Foremost among them is Adams, 41, released last year after morethan 12 years in prison. Adams' conviction in the shooting of aDallas police officer was overturned after a key witness recantedhis testimony and the courts found a prosecutor had withheldevidence.   His story was recounted in the film ``The Thin Blue Line,'' andAdams, who once was just days away from execution, now tours thelecture circuit.   His attorney, Randy Schaffer of Houston, says an Adams casecould happen anywhere. ``I suspect it is something that extendsacross the country,'' he said. ``I don't think it's limited toDallas County.''   But it has happened with unnerving regularity in Dallas:   _ Kimsey, 49, was freed Feb. 9 after spending five years inprison on a 1985 armored-car robbery conviction. A federal prisonersince has confessed to the crime. Kimsey, rearrested after beingfound with marijuana and alcohol, was pardoned by the governor May21 and released two days later.   _ Brown, 42, who spent nine years in prison for the armedrobbery of a Dallas fur store, learned in February she would not beretried. An appeals court overturned her 1980 conviction, rulingprosecutors should have told the defense a key witness had beenconvicted of lying to police.   _ Woten, 36, was pardoned in February after serving almost eightyears for an April 1982 grocery-store robbery; another man hasadmitted the crime.   _ Russell, 37, was pardoned in April after serving 10 years.Another man confessed to the 1980 holdup of a Garland fast-foodrestaurant.   Another case of Dallas justice gone wrong was that of LenellGeter, an aerospace engineer who served 16 months in prison for the1982 armed robbery of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. The casedrew national attention when it was examined on ``60 Minutes.''   ``If you go into any other state ... you'll find the same thingis going on there,'' said Tom Krampitz, executive director of theTexas District and County Attorneys Association in Austin.   Others _ among them, John Boston, executive director of theTexas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association in Austin, and RonaldHuff, director of the Criminal Justice Research Center at OhioState University _ say Dallas County seems to convict an unusualnumber of innocent people.   ``Certainly in terms of known cases ... Dallas County has hadmore than one would expect,'' said Huff, author of the upcomingbook ``Convicted but Innocent: Wrongful Conviction and PublicPolicy.''   Neither side has data to back up its perceptions. Legal expertssay no one tracks wrongful conviction rates, except in deathpenalty cases. But even those who defend Dallas justice say it hascharacteristics not common elsewhere.   Huff advocates re-investigating many cases that date to the daysof Henry Wade, the cigar-chomping prosecutor who ruled the DallasCounty district attorney's office for 36 years before retiring in1987.   Wade pegged his employees' promotions to the number of peoplethey put behind bars and the length of their sentences.   Dallas still has a national reputation for promoting prosecutorson the basis of their conviction rate, said Scott Wallace,legislative director of the National Association of CriminalDefense Lawyers in Alexandria, Va.   ``It's a system that tends to promote the numbers of convictionsover fairness and due process. To my knowledge, that is quiteunusual,'' he said.   The emphasis has changed since John Vance succeeded Wade in thedistrict attorney's office, said Vance's first assistant, NormKinne.   Conviction rates, he said, are ``not as important a factor inour determination if someone is ready to be promoted. It's justsomething that is taken with all the rest of his or herstatistics.''   The critics cite other reasons for wrongful convictions. High onthe list is ``trial by ambush,'' as defense attorneys have taggedprosecutors' practice of springing new evidence at a trial.   ``I think the mentality at the forefront in Dallas is, `Let'shide everything we can ... let's play it like a game,' '' saidSchaffer, who got Adams' conviction overturned partly because ofwithheld evidence.   Kinne maintains the argument should be the other way around.   Unlike many states where both sides of a legal case are requiredto disclose evidence to the other, Texas criminal law is one-sided:prosecutors are required to share certain information with thedefense, but defense attorneys are under no obligation toreciprocate.   ``I find it strange that they can say `trial by ambush' whenthey give us nothing in the way of discovery and we give them awhole lot. How is that an ambush? Who's ambushing who?'' Kinneasked.   Critics also cite a lack of funds for public defenders. Texas'system of public defense offices representing the indigent is lessdeveloped than most other states, said Mardi Crawford, a staffattorney with the National Legal Aid and Defender Association inWashington.   In 1986, Texas ranked 39th in public-defense spending, Ms.Crawford said, citing a Bureau of Justice report of the latestfigures available.   Texas spends an average of $154 per inmate on public defense,she said. New Jersey spent the most _ $540 per inmate _ andArkansas the least, $63.   Krampitz of the District and County Attorneys Association saidall law enforcement authorities need better training and higherpay. And that applies to prosecutors and judges, along with defenseattorneys, he said: ``You pay peanuts, you get monkeys.''   Even those who fault Dallas' justice system say no one shouldplace blame solely on prosecutors.   ``There's a whole lot of other folks that have been involved inthis process,'' Krampitz said. Each wrongful conviction was decidedby a jury, and each convict had a lawyer.   ``Anybody that says the system is perfect is nuts,'' saidSchaffer.   ``Juries bring to the courtroom whatever biases they holdoutside the courtroom,'' he said. ``Not every defendant is guilty,not every police officer tells the truth, not every eyewitness isperfect. The problem is, in individual cases, everybody forgets allthat.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday AMs, July 18</NOTE></DOC>
