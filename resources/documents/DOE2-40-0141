Although Irish government policy in the energy sector is hazy, somebasic principles can be distinguished: continuity of supply at the lowesteconomic cost; securing the discovery and development of domestic resources;and promoting flexibility of fuel sources and a reduction in relianceon imports. The current energy situation is characterised by the following:changes in offshore licensing terms to encourage more exploration inIrish waters; the search for overseas investment in Ireland's singleoil refinery at Whitegate; the rejection of a Nigerian project to installa vacuum distillation unit at the refinery, improve the terminal at BantryBay (put out of action in 1979 after a tanker explosion) and build anoil products pipeline across the country; gasoline prices being kepthigher than necessary by the law requiring the multinationals to buy35% of their oil products from the Irish National Petroleum Corporation;replacement of town gas by natural gas from the Celtic Sea; EEC aid forconstruction of a gas pipeline from Dublin to Dundalk; and the aggressivemarketing of natural gas by Bord Gais. 3 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
