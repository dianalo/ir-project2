We have come to Spain with hope.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Here&quot; is a former school converted a few months ago bythe Red Cross into emergency accommodations for foreignrefugees. Tonight, in addition to several dozen Africans,those staying at the hostel include Poles, Romanians andBulgarians. With varying degrees of justification, all claimto be fleeing oppression at home. More significant for Spainis that all share the hope of forging a new life on Spanishsoil.   The Europeans, most of whom are unskilled workers with noknowledge of Spanish, will probably succeed eventually. TheAfricans, by contrast -- even though many are high-school anduniversity graduates -- are certain to find it harder. In anation unused to welcoming foreigners other than as tourists,the arrival of the Africans is a new and, for many Spaniards,disquieting phenomenon. Given Spain's 15% unemployment rate,many Spaniards believe that foreigners shouldn't be allowedto settle here at all. If, in addition, those foreigners areblack, the issue becomes more sensitive still.   In recent months, African immigrants arriving in growingnumbers have come to embody a thorny problem for Spanishpoliticians. Though still seldom discussed openly, two issues-- that of a new wave of immigration from the Third World andthat of the racist backlash it may provoke -- loom large onSpain's social agenda.   Traditionally, Spaniards have prided themselves on livingin a society free of racism. In this, the nation's ethnichomogeneity has no doubt played a part. King Ferdinand ofAragon and Queen Isabel of Castile drove the Jews out ofSpain nearly 500 years ago, and the Spanish Inquisition soonafterward put an end to the nation's last remaining vestigesof Moorish culture.   Now, Spain is on the verge of becoming once again amultiracial society. And a more realistic solution is needed.&quot;The flow of Africans into Spain will go on increasing,&quot;predicts Felix Barrena, a Spanish Red Cross official. &quot;Thisis a problem which Spanish society will have to absorb.&quot;   For years this nation, rather than attracting immigrants,exported low-cost labor to richer neighbors. Since 1986,however, when Spain joined the European Community, itseconomy has expanded rapidly. Today, tougher controls inother European nations, Spain's new prosperity and itscloseness to North Africa have made it a magnet.   On the face of it, there is room enough. By comparisonwith other European nations, Spain has only a small number offoreign residents. Out of a total population of 40 million,fewer than 2% are immigrants, compared with an EC average ofmore than 4%. And of the 400,000 legal foreign residents,more than half are from other European nations, the U.S. orLatin America, and only a few from Africa or Asia.   But official statistics tell only part of the story -- therest of which is visible on Spanish streets. African faces,which just a few years ago were rare in Madrid and otherSpanish cities, have become much more common. According togovernment estimates, Spain may have between 130,000 and170,000 illegal immigrants from Third World nations.Unofficial estimates put their numbers at perhaps twice orthree times as high as that.   Many Spaniards find themselves forced to re-examine theirview of the national character. &quot;We used to think we weren'ta racist country; now, it's clear we're no different fromother people,&quot; says social worker Jose-Luis Garcia. &quot;Racialtensions in Spain seem bound to grow.&quot;   Illegal immigration has also become a politicalembarrassment, for at least some of the Africans who comehere see Spain as a steppingstone for clandestine entry intoother EC countries. As EC governments prepare for a singleEuropean market in 1993, Spain has applied to join theso-called Schengen group of nations (currently, France,Germany and the Benelux nations) that have already scrappedborder controls along shared frontiers. But Spain's partnersworry about a possible leakage of migrants from its territoryto the rest of Europe, and so the application has been put onhold until Spain takes effective steps to counter illegalimmigration. Although government officials say they are readyto do so, the difficulties are enormous.   The methods used to enter Spain illegally are almost asvaried as the nations from which the immigrants come. Somearrive with tourist visas and simply stay on after theyexpire; others walk across Spain's largely unguarded landfrontier with Portugal, or cross the Mediterranean in smallopen boats from the Moroccan coast.   Possibly the most problematic development, however, hasbeen the sharp increase in the number of foreigners applyingfor political asylum. According to a recent governmentreport, this has now become the principal avenue forimmigration into Spain.   While the numbers are again small by comparison with thosein, say, France, Sweden or Switzerland, they are definitelygrowing: In the Madrid region alone, the number of asylumseekers more than doubled in 1990 from the year before, to5,600. About one-third were Africans, and Red Cross officialssay those coming in often seem to have been tipped off abouthow to do it by others already here.   Red Cross officials say few have documentary evidence tosupport their requests for political asylum. Some may begenuinely fleeing persecution, but Spanish police officialsare skeptical. Many, after they have used up their money fromthe Red Cross, which provides a $320-a-month living allowancefor six months, drift into Spain's underground economy.   So far, the government's response has been limited topromises of more border controls, better equipment forpolice, faster processing of asylum applications and quickeraction to expel foreigners who are discovered to be livinghere illegally. Spain is also seeking agreements withPortugal, Morocco and other nations under which illegalimmigrants would be sent back to the nation from which theyentered Spain.   African community leaders accuse Spain of doing little ornothing to promote the integration of immigrants alreadyhere. And without work papers or residence permits, most ofthe immigrants become easy prey to those who would exploitthem.   Florentino Econo, the chairman of an association ofAfrican residents, asserts that instead of trying to excludeoutsiders, Spaniards should be as welcoming as many foreignnations were to the Spaniards who fled in the aftermath ofSpain's 1936-39 civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
