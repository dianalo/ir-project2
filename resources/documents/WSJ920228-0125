It has shown it candeliver marvelous drugs and captivate Wall Street, and bysome estimates, the industry's revenues will jump sevenfoldto $40 billion by the end of the decade. It has the supportof the Bush administration, which last month proposed a $4billion program to boost biotechnology research.   &quot;Biotechnology proved itself in the '80s,&quot; says JohnWilkerson, a New York health-care industry consultant. &quot;The'90s are going to be the testing ground for individualcompanies.&quot;   Many new biotech companies are already being tested by thestock market. It isn't unusual for a company to lose -- orgain -- a chunk of its market value in one day. Wednesday,Centocor Inc. plunged $8.125 to $33.125 because of questionsfrom the Food and Drug Administration about its septic shockdrug. Yet on Jan. 13, Enzo Biochem Inc. shares jumped 77%after the company introduced eight new cancer diagnosticproducts.   So far, only a few biotechnology companies, such as AmgenInc., have made money. Indeed, the industry is gushing morered ink than ever: For the year ended June 30, losses swelled45% to $2.9 billion from a year earlier, according to Ernst andamp;Young, an accounting firm.   Those losses underscore the fact that the great majorityof the industry's players are still high-risk,development-stage companies that could easily scramble theirnew nest eggs. &quot;A lot of very young companies suddenly gotplenty of money,&quot; says Jean Deleage, a San Francisco venturecapitalist. &quot;Now they have to demonstrate they have thediscipline to spend it wisely.&quot;   The science behind the business is advancing so fast thatresearch and development costs threaten to absorb much of themoney the industry has raised. To survive, companies willhave to focus their development efforts much more than in thepast. But even businesses that find seasoned managers to plotstrategy and see products through to market may findthemselves pinched not only by competition, but also bygovernment and insurance industry efforts to hold downhealth-care costs.   Younger companies will have to show that &quot;theirtechnologies work and that they can successfully turn theminto effective products,&quot; says Dr. Wilkerson, the consultant.For more mature businesses, the challenges will includefunding enormously expensive clinical trials while buildingmanufacturing and sales operations. All will be jockeying fortalented managers, patents, corporate partners, regulatoryapprovals and ever more capital.   &quot;It was inordinately easier a decade ago to pick theCentocors and Amgens of the world&quot; before they emerged asindustry leaders, says Peter Drake, an analyst at VectorSecurities International. &quot;The companies were simpler, theirtechnologies were easier to understand, and their competitionwas much easier to assess.&quot;   The industry's scientific explosion further complicatesthe picture. Bioengineered drugs are already used to treatanemia, immune-system suppression induced by anti-cancerdrugs, dwarfism in children, hepatitis and heart attacks. Ahost of other products are being tested in the clinic,including drugs to kill cancer cells without hurting normalones and to prevent blood clots that can cause strokes andheart attacks. In the lab are crop plants geneticallyengineered to resist pests, drugs to block the geneticmalfunctions underlying cancer, bioengineered microbes thatconsume toxic wastes and medicines to arrest disorders ofaging, such as Alzheimer's disease.   More than 100 biotechnology drugs are in clinical trials,and many will compete for shares of the same markets. About10 categories of novel drugs are under development to treatautoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis andmultiple sclerosis, says David Stone, an analyst with Cowen andamp;Co.   One key to navigating this flood of products is forcompanies to &quot;focus,&quot; says Vector's Mr. Drake. Amgen'ssuccess, he adds, stems largely from a mid-1980s decision bythe company's founder and former chairman, George Rathmann,who &quot;looked at Amgen's pipeline of products and its cash andsaid, `We can't do all this stuff.' He directed the entirecompany to focus on EPO,&quot; the company's lucrative anti-anemiadrug that now stands alone in its niche.   In the industry's early days, the main strategy was to &quot;gowith what science you have and hope you can get there first,&quot;adds Stephen Duzan, chief executive and founder of ImmunexCorp., a biotechnology company based in Seattle. But nowbusinesses must be more selective, placing a smaller numberof bets by carefully analyzing patent positions and marketpotential, which involves not just a drug's therapeutic valuebut also how likely the federal government and other healthinsurers are to pay for it.   In an industry whose products can cost $100 million eachto develop, companies that don't focus early can quickly getoverextended. Consider NeoRx Corp., a Seattle company startedin 1984 to develop antibody-based diagnostic and anti-canceragents. It has requested federal marketing approval for twodiagnostic products and has four cancer therapeutic anddiagnostic agents in clinical trials. But it has yet to sella product, and its losses have mounted steadily, totalingmore than $54 million in its first six years.   With a cash crunch looming, NeoRx in the last two yearshas drastically narrowed its research and developmentactivities, limiting product development to the imaging andanti-cancer areas. It also has decided to license its firstproducts to outside companies rather than to further developthem in-house. The result: a reduction of its work force byabout 40% and a drop in its &quot;burn rate&quot; -- how fast companiesuse up cash -- by more than a third to between $10 millionand $11 million.   Another lesson from biotechnology's first decade is theimportance of installing hardheaded executives early.Companies &quot;need to hire managers who have the skills todirect a full-service drug company, not just a researchboutique,&quot; says Dr. Wilkerson, the consultant.   Perhaps two-thirds of biotechnology companies are tryingto recruit senior executives and business developmentprofessionals, says Mr. Deleage, the venture capitalist.Walter Channing of CW Ventures, a New York venture capitalfirm, adds, &quot;The key ingredient is increasingly becoming thestar manager, not the star molecule.&quot;   But not even a crack management team can guarantee that abiotechnology company's well-laid plans won't go astray. Someof the industry's biggest uncertainties stem from the battleto cut health-care costs. Government decisions on whether topay costs of new drugs for patients covered by Medicare andother programs can be critical to the drugs' success. Becausegenetically engineered drugs tend to be costly -- commonlyseveral thousand dollars for a course of treatment -- theyhave become lightning rods for criticism by those seeking tohold down such costs. &quot;Five to eight years from now, we'll belooking at a very different cost and reimbursementenvironment&quot; for drugs, says Linda Miller, an analyst withPaineWebber Inc.   Indeed, the fear of tightened reimbursement rules fordrugs already has some companies shying away from diseaseareas considered non-life-threatening. Immunex is pullingback in certain woundhealing areas. Though there's asignificant market for companies that can help speed woundhealing, the expense of developing such drugs and the pricesthat will be considered reasonable for them &quot;will make itharder to recover costs&quot; than for drugs to treat fataldiseases, says Mr. Duzan.   Reimbursement policy isn't the only front on whichbiotechnology companies are feeling the heat from rocketinghealth-care costs. A bill recently introduced in Congresswould cap sales of drugs under the federal Orphan Drug Act.The law now allows companies that develop drugs for diseasesafflicting fewer than 200,000 people to be granted exclusivemarketing rights to the drugs for seven years. The proposedcap would revoke the exclusivity when cumulative sales of anorphan drug exceed $200 million.   The bill, if enacted, would undercut the ability ofbiotechnology companies to finance drug development, saysHenri Termeer, chief executive of Genzyme Corp., abiotechnology concern in Cambridge, Mass., that's developingtreatments for cystic fibrosis with orphan drug status. Inparticular, Mr. Termeer argues, the bill would curtail theuse of &quot;off-balance-sheet&quot; financing for such drugs -- anincreasingly popular strategy in which companies formpublicly traded research subsidiaries to develop the drugs.Many investors buy shares in such spinoffs partly because therisks are balanced by the potentially large payoffs forproducts with orphan drug status, he says.   Mr. Termeer's arguments highlight biotechnology'sexpanding need for capital as it pushes more products intothe costly clinical trial phase. Many biotechnology companiesare seeking partnerships that will further their goals ofbecoming big, independent drug companies. In the past, thecompanies often had little choice but to trade technology formoney in licensing pacts with drug-company partners. But nowthe industry's basic technology has been validated by thesuccessful launch of blockbuster drugs. Last year'sstock-selling bonanza also has strengthened their hands.   For three-year-old Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., which raised$72 million last year, the funds mean &quot;more flexibility andsay in how and with whom we will do deals,&quot; says founderStanley Crooke. Isis doesn't have to continually flog itstechnology in presentations to potential partners -- aprocess that's very time-consuming for company scientists,Mr. Crooke adds. And it has the luxury of holding out untilit finds allies that bring both money and other competitiveadvantages to the company.   True collaborations, rather than just trades of technologyfor money, are on the rise between biotechnology companiesand their bigger partners. When ImmuLogic PharmaceuticalCorp., Cambridge, Mass., recently agreed to develop itsanti-allergy technology with Marion Merrell Dow Inc., aKansas City, Mo., drug concern, the companies formed acommittee of managers from each side to oversee the work.ImmuLogic also retained U.S. rights to market products basedon the research.   The secret to successful collaborations is to &quot;make sureyou have a champion at the larger company who believes inyour product,&quot; says Ramesh Ratan, senior vice president atRepligen Corp., a Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology concern.And if the partnership doesn't work out, consider buying thetechnology back from the larger company before the projectdies on the vine.   Last year Repligen reacquired rights from Merck andamp; Co. tocertain monoclonal antibodies for fighting AIDS infections.Merck and Repligen wanted to pursue different uses for thetechnology, Mr. Ratan says. Moreover, Merck had licensedsimilar antibodies from another biotechnology concern,Medimmune Inc., indicating the larger company's interest inRepligen's antibodies had fallen.   Partnerships between biotech and drug companies sometimesunravel because of clashes between big-company andsmall-company operating styles. But that's less of a problemwith a growing variation on the partnership theme:collaborations between biotechnology companies. Last year,such partnerships accounted for about half of U.S.pharmaceutical research alliances, according to Ernst andamp;Young.   Many biotechnology companies now have the financialwherewithal to play the role of deep-pockets partner, notesRichard F. Pops, president and chief executive officer ofAlkermes Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., company developingtreatments for brain diseases. After raising about $60million in public offerings, his company recently agreed tofund up to $26.5 million of joint research with CortexPharmaceuticals Inc., Irvine, Calif., on drugs to treatstroke and other brain disorders.   In a related trend, the buyers of troubled biotechnologycompanies are increasingly likely to be other biotechconcerns -- a noted example being Chiron Corp.'s purchase ofCetus Corp. last year in a stock swap valued at $660 million.This trend should help prevent a slowing of biotechnology'sfinancial momentum, says Vector Securities' Mr. Drake, evenif the stock market isn't as generous with the industryduring the next few years as it was in 1991. &quot;The good newsis that the biotech industry will be self-rejuvenating as itmoves into the 1990s,&quot; he says.   ---              Who's Who in the Biotech World                                                                                                         The leading biotechnology companies are ranked by stockmarket capitalization                                                                                                           STOCK                                        PROPRIETARY    MARKET      ------- NUMBER OF DRUGS* -------  DRUGS FOR    CAPITAL-    IN PRE-       IN       AWAITING    HUMANS    IZATION     CLINICAL   CLINICAL      FDA         ON ($ Millions)   TRIALS      TRIALS     APPROVAL    MARKET                                                                                                        Amgen                                                                                                        Genentech    3,080.2       N.A.        10          0          3                                                                                                        Chiron    1,509.6        7          14          0          3                                                                                                        Centocor    1,296.8        0           5          3          0                                                                                                        Synergen    1,205.4        6           3          0          0                                                                                                        Genzyme      935.9        1           1          0          1                                                                                                        Biogen      879.8        3           3          0          2                                                                                                        Gensia      860.1        8           1          0          0                                                                                                        Immunex      791.8        4           4          1          2                                                                                                        Alliance      644.0        7           2          1          0                                                                                                        US Bioscience      570.8        4           4          1          1                                                                                                        Xoma      489.5        7           6          2          0                                                                                                        Medimmune      448.8        6           1          0          1                                                                                                        Affymax      409.6        0           0          0          0                                                                                                        Immune Response      395.2        1           1          0          0                                                                                                        Genetics Institute      379.6        3           3          2          1                                                                                                        Molecular Biosystems      373.8        0           0          1          0                                                                                                        Cytogen**      352.3        0           1          0          0                                                                                                        Immunomedics      337.1        1           2          0          0                                                                                                        Liposome Co.                                                                                                          *Numbers indicate the actual number of compounds indevelopment for therapeutic purposes.
