But Procurator General Alexander Sukharev said he had not plansto take action against the investigators or the magazine Ogonyok,which published their charges June 26.   Publication of the charges against unidentified delegates causeda storm of criticism by delegates to the four-day conference thatended Friday in the Kremlin.   On Thursday, Ogonyok editor Vitaly Korotich personally turnedover to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev papers that he saidproved the charges. He told the conference that an overlappingsystem of party and court control prevented the suspects from beingbrought to justice.   Asked about the case at a news briefing Monday, Sukharev saidthe investigators ``abused their authority'' by turning to Ogonyokwith their material.   ``We have the principle that people are regarded as not guiltyin this country,'' he said. ``This is a constitutional principle.''   Queried whether that meant he would be taking action against themagazine, Sukharev said, ``I can say I don't have such an intentionas yet.''   He said the matter still was being investigated and that hisoffice should be able to draw its final conclusions soon.   Ogonoyok said investigators trying to unravel corruption in theCentral Asian republic of Uzbekistan came across evidence that fourdelegates to the party conference had taken bribes.   Stories this year have laid open systematic corruption that ledall the way to Yuri Churbanov, son-in-law of late President LeonidI. Brezhnev.   Sukharev said Ogonyok's report was true that some people triedto block the investigation, but he added that there had beenarrests and convictions of such people.   Churbanov, who served as first deputy interior minister, facestrial soon on charges of bribery and abuse of power, the procuratorgeneral said.</TEXT></DOC>
