The incident was set off when the house of one brother was stonedby masked youths. It reflected the growing tension between theyouthful enforcers of the 21-month-old uprising and Palestiniansaccused to cooperating with Israel.   In occupied Gaza City, soldiers shot and killed Amer AhmadMansur, 21, Arab hospital officials reported. Military officialsconfirmed the death and said a patrol fired after being attackedwith two firebombs, killing the attacker.   In other clashes in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank,Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 16 Palestinians, Arab doctorssaid. The army command confirmed five wounded in Gaza and said itwas checking further.   Authorities in Haifa, Israel, reported that 10 people wereinjured, at least 1,700 acres of forest and grassland were burnedand a settlement was threatened Tuesday in a big forest arson attack.   The fires began around noon on the slopes of Mt. Carmel andthreatened the kibbutz, or communal settlement, of Beit Oren.   Officials there said 80 children and 40 adults were evacuated.The fire also crept close to Haifa's Daniya neighborhood.   Police later arrested two arson suspects, said Gideon Arbel,deputy superintendent of the northern police district.   In Beit Sahour, Mayor Hanna Al-Atrash was among the victims inMonday night's rampage. He was reportedly pulled from his car andheld hostage for an hour. Al-Atrash was hospitalized Tuesday inJerusalem with bruises and a gashed head.   In the melee, Palestinian youths set fire to the brothers' homesand seriously damaged them, townspeople said.   The army did not intervene in the incident in this town nearBethlehem, but on Tuesday arrested a third brother for suspectedinvolvement in the fray, residents said. An army spokesman said hehad no information on the trouble in Beit Sahur.   The fracas began Monday night when dozens of masked youths threwbottles and stones at the house of Mahmoud Zahlan.   According to residents in this town of 11,000 people, Zahlan andhis brother Mousa were active in the uprising but were convertedinto informers while jailed for their activities in the revolt.   After the stoning, witnesses said, the brothers and severalrelatives got knives and clubs and went into the streets, stoppingcars and beating passengers.   One victim was dragged from a car and stabbed in the shoulder,arm and leg, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition their namesnot be used. The mayor also was pulled from his car, then beaten atMahmoud Zahlan's house, townspeople said.   The army meanwhile said it soon will assign ``monitors'' to unitsin the occupied lands as a way of cutting down shooting wounds towomen and children during clashes with soldiers.   An army spokeswoman, who cannot be identified by name undermilitary regulations, said the monitors would be assinged to watchfiring when women and children are present. She said they would beassigned ``in the next few days.''
