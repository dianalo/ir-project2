CAMPBELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An advocacy group is calling on members ofCongress to do more to help black South African children, sayingthey will be hurt by stronger U.S. economic sanctions against thesegregated nation.   The Wake Up America Coalition dramatized its ``OperationHeartbreak'' campaign on Tuesday by arranging for groups of blackchildren to visit congressional offices.   Some supporters of tougher sanctions, intended to pressure thewhite minority government in Pretoria into granting more freedomsto blacks, expressed skepticism about the group's motives.   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., called the campaign a ``a frontfor one of the many South African supported and funded groups.There is no question in my mind that this is designed to developopposition to the (sanctions) bill.''   But the Rev. Kenneth Frazier, chairman of the coalition, said,``No matter what political side you're on, anti-sanctions,pro-sanctions, anti-sanctions, it doesn't matter.   ``We are here in the interest of millions of suffering blackSouth African children who are already the poorest and the mosthelpless and the most vulnerable in South Africa (who will) befurther harassed ... and suffer all the more with a further roundof U.S. sanctions,'' he said.   ``We are tired of seeing black and brown children the world overalways carrying the political burdens and consequences of theseirrational struggles for power among politicians East and West.''   Fraizer maintained that the campaign was not inspired by thevote on the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1988 scheduled forthe end of June. He said his position is based on his own trips toSouth Africa.   ``They are caught between apartheid and U.S. sanctions whichrepresent another form of hostility and oppression,'' he said ofthe country's blacks.   The coalition is delivering dolls of black children tocongressional offices, accompanied by letters appealing forcontributions to help feed and clothe black South African children.   The letters ask recipients to donate $300 a year each to``personally sponsor a child's food and clothing for as long asU.S. sanctions legislation is in effect or until apartheid istotally dismantled.''   The letters also ask for a statement of support by June 21 ``sothat we can brief your constituents on where you stand.''   Dymally said such tactics constitute political intimidation.   ``This is designed to intimidate liberals and to solidify theopposition of the right,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
