(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former Republican congressmen,including one who says that if AIDS isn't ``the wrath of God ... itshould be,'' are battling for a chance to topple liberal DemocraticSen. Donald Riegle.   But neither Jim Dunn nor Robert Huber has managed to generatemuch enthusiasm and both are financing their campaigns largely withtheir own money.   In contrast, Riegle, Michigan's senior senator, has $4 millionin campaign funds, wide backing, and a 22-year record in Washingtonas he faces Tuesday's Democratic primary unopposed.   Dunn and Huber want to make Riegle's liberal voting record theissue, a strategy the 50-year-old Riegle likes because he sees thatas one of his strong points as he seeks a third six-year term.   ``I think the experience that I've developed in the Congress andsome of the things we've helped accomplish _ helping the farmers(hurt by floods) two years ago, and saving Chrysler and savingSocial Security _ these are all things where I took a leadershiprole and we got things done,'' he said.   He also emphasizes that he's expected to become chairman of theSenate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee if he isre-elected Nov. 8.   Dunn and Huber contend Riegle's record, including a 100 percentscore in a recent voting survey by the liberal public policy groupAmericans for Democratic Action, means his views aren't in linewith those of most Michigan voters.   ``He's a big spender. He's voted for cutting defense and forgiving up the Panama Canal, and that turned out to be a bigdisaster,'' said Huber. ``He's been taking campaign funds from allover the United States. Those are things I think people are goingto be pretty fed up with.''   A Detroit Free Press-WXYZ-TV poll released July 18 showed thatof the likely Republican voters, 55 percent hadn't decided whichcandidate they would support in the primary.   That is reflected in the financing for the two campaigns.Contributions to Huber's campaign between April 1 and July 13totaled $846. He has loaned his campaign $221,000.   Dunn reported contributions of $39,283, and has loaned hiscampaign more than $224,000, some of which has been paid back.   Huber, a conservative making his fourth try for the nomination,has portrayed himself as a staunch Reagan Republican. Specifically,he's for preserving federal income tax cuts, a strong defense,using more federal muscle in the war on drugs, and against abortion.   AIDS came to the fore after Dunn mentioned it in a radiointerview last week as a subject about which he and his opponentdiffered.   ``I take a reasonable, rational, I think very responsibleapproach to the problems that face this nation,'' Dunn said. ``Mr.Huber has said that the reason people have AIDS is the wrath ofGod, punishment from God'' of homosexuals and drug users.   ``Jim Dunn does not think AIDS is the wrath of God,'' he saidlater.   Huber, asked about Dunn's remarks, said ``I don't know whetherit's the wrath of God, but if it isn't it should be.''   Huber, 65, has been the mayor of the Detroit suburb of Troy, astate senator and a congressman. He was defeated in a re-electionbid in 1974 by now-Gov. James Blanchard.   Dunn, 44, an East Lansing homebuilder, holds more moderateviews. During his term in Congress, 1981-82, Dunn supported most ofReagan's tax cut and budget reduction policies, but often opposedthe administration on social issues and cuts in aid to collegestudents.   Observers favor Dunn in the primary because he has the supportof most of the GOP regulars and moderates.   The Free Press-WXYZ poll found Huber ahead of Dunn, 26 percentto 19 percent, but Dunn's lead was within the poll's margin oferror of 8.4 percentage points, and both trailed the numberundecided. This portion of the July 11-13 telephone survey wasconducted among 137 people who described themselves as likelyRepublican primary voters.   Another portion of the poll found Riegle had a 51 percent to 19percent lead over either Dunn or Huber, with 30 percent of thevoters undecided. That survey of 598 people who describedthemselves as likely primary voters had a margin of error of 4percentage points.</TEXT></DOC>
