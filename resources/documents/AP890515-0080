RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today rejected a Bushadministration appeal aimed at giving the government more power tocontrol rents for federally subsidized housing.   The court, without comment, refused to review a decisionfavoring landlords in Washington state.   At issue is an interpretation of the housing subsidy law adoptedby former President Reagan's administration in 1981. The lawprovides subsidies for those people who cannot afford to pay thefull amount of their rent.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1981 said thegovernment could control rents by requiring local surveys of whatlandlords were being paid for non-subsidized, comparable housing.   The surveys were to substitute in some cases for a system ofrent increases pegged to an inflation formula adopted in 1974 forsubsidized housing.   The substitution of the market survey approach was challenged ina federal lawsuit in 1983 by Rainier View Associates, owners ofsubsidized housing in Bremerton, Wash.   HUD officials said Rainier View must conduct a study of housingin the vicinity to support its bid for higher rents.   Rainier View said it was entitled to an inflation-based hikegeared to its rising costs. The landlord said the government wasreneging on a 20-year contract it signed with Rainier View in 1980guaranteeing that rents would keep pace with rising costs.   A federal judge ruled in favor of HUD, but the 9th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals reversed the decision last June.   Federal law ``does not permit HUD to abandon entirely theformula method it chose and to adjust rents solely on the basis ofa market survey,'' the appeals court said.   Administration lawyers said the ruling could mean an additional$50 million in subsidies in states within the 9th Circuit court'sjurisdiction: Arizona, Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana,Nevada, Oregon and Washington.   If the appeals court ruling were adopted nationwide, the costwould be more than $200 million, the government's appeal said.   The additional subsidies will have to be paid for by taxpayersor by trimming other aspects of the housing subsidy program, thegovernment lawyers said.   Lawyers for Rainier View Associates and another Washingtonhousing developer, Mayer Built Homes, accused the government of a``hypocritical'' attack on the subsidy program.   ``Saving money is commendable, but not at the expense ofcontractual rights and of the larger view of the public interest,''the landlords' lawyers said.   Cutting subsidies will prompt developers to desert the program,they said, adding, ``The depletion of our already small inventoryof housing for the elderly, the handicapped and the disadvantagedcannot be in the public interest.''   The case is U.S. vs. Rainier View Associates, 88-1515.</TEXT></DOC>
