(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The minister who now heads the church thatJim Bakker founded as the cornerstone of his PTL empire said therewas no irony intended in the parable he chose as the topic for hismidweek sermon.   The Rev. Sam Johnson chose the parable that says it is easier fora camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man toget into heaven.   Bakker, a Bible school classmate and Johnson's former boss, goeson trial Monday on charges of fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors sayhe and other PTL executives diverted $4 million given to theministry to support luxurious lifestyles.   ``What Jesus tells us in this parable is that it's not the amountof work that's done, but the attitude in which the work is donethat's important,'' Johnson told about 150 worshipers Wednesdaynight at Heritage Church in a sermon before the telecast of hiscable evangelical show.   When Johnson was asked whether he had Bakker in mind, he replied,``I did not choose that parable tonight because of the timing. Butthe timing sometimes is of God.''   Bakker built Heritage Church as part of Heritage USA, aPTL-managed enterprise that grew over the course of a decade into a2,300-acre Christian resort, broadcasting complex and theme park.But Bakker was forced to leave PTL ministries in 1987 after a sexualscandal, and PTL is now in bankruptcy court. Heritage USA and otherPTL assets have been bought by a Toronto businessman.   Heritage Church and its parent Heritage Ministries, which runsthe daily cable program shown on the Inspirational Network, weresevered from PTL in bankruptcy proceedings last year.   Johnson and Bakker attended Bible school together in Minneapolis30 years ago, and Johnson later worked at PTL as an executiveresponsible for world missions. But Johnson quit in a dispute withBakker over funding for the mission programs. He returned toHeritage Church after Bakker resigned from PTL.   In June, Johnson and his congregation left the grounds ofHeritage USA for a new church on Interstate 77 in a Charlotteneighborhood of small, older homes. The new facility comprises threecast concrete buildings.   On Wednesday night, the sanctuary smelled of the new carpet thathad been installed on the platform. A piano and small combo providedmusic and a wall with recessed blue arches provided a backdrop forTV cameras.   Thirty minutes after the prayer service ended, the soft lightsthat lit the Heritage Church sanctuary were engulfed by bright TVspotlights for the broadcast of ``The Old-Time Camp Meeting Hour,''a nightly one-hour show sent to cable systems around the country.   The congregation, including many who had been bused 10 miles fromHeritage USA, gathered in the center section of the sanctuary, aformer gymnasium, to be part of the show.   Wednesday night's guest speaker was the Rev. Charles Crank, theDistrict Superintendent of Indiana for the Assemblies of God, thedenomination that defrocked Bakker in March 1987. Viewers got onlypart of his 50-minute sermon because an electrical storm knocked theministry off the air for the first half-hour.   Heritage Ministries normally broadcasts an hour each night, butit bought a second hour of satellite time Wednesday night to ask fordonations.   Television viewers, Johnson said later, have become skeptical ofpreachers crying for money over the airwaves in the wake of the manyrecent evangelical scandals.   ``But we have no alternative,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
