The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in favor of theKenaitze Indian Tribe.   The tribe, with about 400 members, has depended on fishing andhunting for its subsistence for hundreds of years.   A federal law enacted in 1980 protects subsistence fishing bygiving it priority over commercial and sport fishing in federalwaters in rural areas.   But Alaska officials said the changing economy in the KenaiPeninsula near Anchorage has transformed the region from a ruralarea.   A 1987 state law defines a rural area as one in which ``thenon-commercial, customary and traditional use of fish or game forpersonal or family consumption is a principal characteristic of theeconomy.''   State officials said that by that standard the recentlycommercialized Kenai Peninsula is no longer rural.   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the ``creativeredefinition'' of rural is a ``transparent'' move ``to protectcommercial and sport-fishing interests.''   The appeals court noted that the peninsula has some 25,000 peoplespread out over an area roughly the size of Vermont and NewHampshire combined.   Alaska's definition of rural ``would exclude practically allareas of the United States that we think of as rural, includingvirtually the entirety of such farming and ranching states as Iowaand Wyoming,'' the appeals court said.   The Alaska attorney general's office said the ruling may depriveAlaska of control over fishing and hunting in 60 percent of thestate.   The case is Alaska vs. Kenaitze Indian Tribe, 88-1642.</TEXT></DOC>
