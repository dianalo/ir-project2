This borehole was used to performa series of in-situ experiments to establish the constitutive behaviourof rock-salt, to measure the temperature-induced compression on a heatedtube and to validate the computer codes for the thermo-mechanical behaviour.Three types of experiments are performed and described in this report:free isothermal convergence measurements; temperature-induced pressuremeasurements; free non-isothermal convergence measurements. It is shownthat the thermo-mechanical behaviour of rock-salt can be described accuratelywith a set of constitutive equations based upon elastic behaviour andsecondary creep. It is measured that the state of stress at a depth of830 metres deviates significantly from the lithostatic pressure. Thisdeviation is shown to be caused by the stress redistribution due to thelarge excavations in the mine. The maximum compression on a heated tubeis measured to be about 35 MPa for a lithostatic pressure of 17 MPa anda maximum salt temperature of 175/sup O/C. In this report the resultsare given of a feasibility study on the dry drilling of a 600 metre deepborehole in Asse II. This study is based on the classic roller-bit configuration.Parallel, the GSF has developed a more advanced drilling technique, whichwill be pursued for the 600 metre hole experiment. The study under considerationmust therefore be seen as a ''backing up solution'' in the improbablesituation that the advanced GSF system will not fulfil its promises.</TEXT></DOC>
