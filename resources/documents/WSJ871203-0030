In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it holds 11,576,900 shares, including 592,400 purchased Nov. 9 to Nov. 24 for $2.545 to $2.75 each.    A spokesman for the Houston-based oil and gas exploration concern said the purchase of shares didn't come as a surprise. &quot;They are good, strong shareholders and we welcome them increasing their position in the company.&quot; Officials of Dyson-Kissner-Moran hold three seats on Conquest's board.    John H. FitzSimon, secretary and general counsel of Dyson-Kissner-Moran, said the additional shares were bought because they are &quot;a good investment at these price levels.&quot;    He said Dyson-Kissner-Moran may raise its stake further, but isn't interested in acquiring the concern.    In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange, Conquest closed at $2.75, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
