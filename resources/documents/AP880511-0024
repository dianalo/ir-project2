Spokesmen for the two normally combative groups announcedTuesday they had reached a three-year truce in their long-standingtussle over the killing of sea mammals off the U.S. coast.   ``They're going to give us a three-year lease on life,'' saidDayton Alverson of Natural Resources Consultants, who said he wasspeaking for commercial fishing interests in Alaska.   Alverson and Bo Bricklemyer, a Greenpeace lawyer speaking for acoalition of environmental organizations, said the pact is designedto end the threat that recent court decisions could put many U.S.fishermen out of business in 1989.   The court rulings said that the Commerce Department could notissue new 1989 permits to fishermen to kill mammals unless it coulddemonstrate that this would not deplete the population of aspecific mammal.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and theMarine Mammal Commission say they lack adequate information to makesuch declarations on a number of air-breathing sea creatures.   The agreement, if it is accepted by Congress, would allowcontinued issuance of permits for the incidental killing of manymammals through 1991 in return for commercial fishery cooperationin obtaining data on their populations.   The plan also calls for limits on the numbers of northern furseals and northern sea lions that can be taken by fishermen, whooften find portions of their catch snatched away by sea mammalsbefore they can be landed.   The agreement, which deals with coastal fishing, does notaddress the problem of dolphins killed by tuna fishermen in theeastern Pacific.   Part of the agreement calls for outside observers to be onfishing boats. Alverson said he wants the federal government to paythe $2 million to $2{ million needed each year to hire 35 observers.   Bricklemyer said environmentalists agreed to the three-yearhiatus in return for the fishing industry educating its membersabout mammal protection and collecting data that can be used tomake decisions about whether a particular mammal is facingdepletion.   ``We had two choices: shut down the industry, which nobodywanted to do, or find out what's going on,'' said Bricklemyer,adding that Alverson's group and the environmentalists would worktogether to get Congress to overturn the court rulings.   Alverson said: ``There is a growing recognition in the fishingcommunity that we have to live with the interests of theenvironmental community. ... You can't keep going on flailing ateach other.''   The agreement was announced shortly before the start of ahearing on marine mammal protection by the House Merchant Marineand Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservationand the environment.   Asked his opinion of the agreement, subcommittee chairman GerryStudds, D-Mass., said: ``I don't know. I haven't looked at it yet.''   A wildlife lobbyist, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthat environmental groups made the deal in order to try to salvagesomething from expected action by Congress this year to overturnthe court rulings.</TEXT></DOC>
