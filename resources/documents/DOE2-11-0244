In a depth ofwater of 20 m it is only possible to cut steel up to 80 mm. This is notenough for the dismantling technology. Aim of research work: Plasma arccutting technology should be developed to enable cutting a plate independentof its thickness. Method of research: A plasma-arc-saw has been developedfor a thermal cutting of materials, similar to a mechanical saw. To developand optimize the special nozzles of the plasma-arc-saw the submergedcombustion burner has been developed parallel by the arc-saw. Results:There are no problems of thermal cutting a steel independent of its thickness.The thickness of the plate depends only on the diameter of the saw disc.The water depth of 20 m reduced the cutting speed of 10%. The plasma-arc-sawenables thermal cutting of a plate independent of its thickness in awater depth of 20 m without requiring a force. The remote controlleddismantling of a reactor vessel and other components with greater wallthickness is possible. (orig./HP) With 21 refs., 6 tabs., 87 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
