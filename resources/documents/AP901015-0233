(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dozens of Canada lynx shipped from theYukon are digging their claws into the high peaks of New York'sAdirondack Mountains in one of the nation's newest wildliferestoration projects.   In addition, female moose could be moved to the Adirondacks asearly as next year to keep company with a lonely herd of males.   Some nature lovers want to bring back wolves and cougars, butsome residents say that's going too far.   One advocate of wolves and cougars is Neil Woodworth, lobbyistfor the Adirondack Mountain Club.   ``You're never going to see them, you're never going to bethreatened by them, but you're going to hear them at night,'' hesays ``It's the very essence of the wilderness, the kind ofexperience you'll treasure a lifetime.''   While many people are afraid of wolves and cougars, the lessdangerous lynx and docile moose are welcomed by conservationistsand Adirondack residents alike.   Fifty lynx have been released since last year around Newcomb inEssex County, about 100 miles north of Albany, says biologistRainer Brocke, who heads the program. About 40 more will bereleased next year.   Canada lynx are sleek cats with long fur and tufted ears,weighing from 18 to 35 pounds. The cats live in forests, andlumbering wiped them out in the Adirondacks in the late 1800s.   The high peaks can sustain about 70 lynx, says Brocke, aprofessor at the state University College of Environmental Scienceand Forestry in Syracuse. By next year, enough lynx will have beenreleased to make up for cats lost to road kills, disease or evenpoachers, he says.   Biologist Bob Lund of the New Jersey Fish, Game and WildlifeDivision says, ``New York has a tremendous land advantage with theAdirondacks. They'll probably be real successful.''   New Jersey's efforts to reintroduce the lynx's cousin - thebobcat - in the northern third of the state failed, mainly becauseonly 24 cats were released from 1977 to 1981, Lund says.   Human development ``essentially pushed out and ran over'' NewJersey's bobcat population by the 1950s, Lund says. Only a fewbobcat remained, and the population has been virtually unchangeddespite the restoration effort, he says.   The lynx may fare better. So far, six have been killed by cars,while another raiding a chicken coop was shot by a farmer. The restare thriving, and at least one pair apparently mated last spring,Brocke says.   The cats are tracked by radio collars. The males have roamedareas as large as 700 square miles. Some lynx have wandered all theway to New England and New Brunswick, Brocke says.   ``They exercise their freedom to roam,'' he says. ``Someexercise it too much.''   The lynx are roaming to ``pick the areas where they'reinterested in living and setting up shop,'' says Kent Gustafson, aresearch assistant for the project. Those released in 1989 aresettling down, he says.   Environmental officials hope to release female moose that mayentice about 20 migratory males wandering the Adirondacks to settledown as well.   ``The number there now is not going to get any larger becausemost of them are males,'' Brocke says.   The state Department of Environmental Conservation could beginreleasing moose in the mountains by late next year, says Peter Nye,who heads the agency's endangered species unit.   While New Jersey's bobcat program failed, a wild turkeyrestoration had dramatic success. A decade ago, 23 turkeys werereleased. Today, New Jersey's wild turkeys number 5,000 and thestate allows limited hunting of the birds, Lund says.   In North Carolina, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hasreintroduced 22 red wolves in Alligator River National WildlifeRefuge since 1987.   The wolves were bred in captivity from only 40 survivors of thespecies. Those survivors were rounded up in Texas and Louisiana in1973, after Congress passed the Endangered Species Act.   ``I tell people that if the Endangered Species Act had not beenpassed till 1976, there would be no red wolves today,'' says WarrenParker, who heads the program.   Two litters of red wolf pups were born in the refuge this year,Parker says. More wolves will be released in other parts of theEastern Seaboard next year, he said.   Contrary to claims made by opponents of such efforts, wolves andother carnivores are not beasts from hell, Parker says.   ``You're not going to have to pull up and move because we putwolves in next to you,'' he says. ``They're not going to chaseschool buses and attack children.''   Red wolves feed mostly on small mammals and do not hunt inpacks. Their cousin - the gray wolf - does hunt in bands, and isfinding a cooler welcome in the Adirondacks and other areas whereconservationists want them reintroduced.   Defenders of Wildlife, a conservation group in Washington, D.C.,is pushing federal officials to re-establish gray wolves inYellowstone National Park in Wyoming.   ``A bloody and pointed and government-sanctioned effort toshoot, poison and trap the grey wolf off the face of the earth''has left it all but extinct in the lower 48 states, says thegroup's spokeswoman, Mary Margaret Patterson.   Since the wolf died out in Yellowstone around 1920, the park hasbeen overrun by elk and bison, the wolf's prey, Patterson says.   The wolf is needed to thin elk and bison herds that are on thebrink of starvation, she says.   Ranchers fearful for their livestock oppose bringing back thewolf.   Adirondack residents don't mind lynx, which feed on snowshoehare and other small mammals. But only the staunchest of naturelovers want large predators such as wolves and cougars living nextdoor.   ``They add an incredible asthetic quality,'' says Woodworth ofthe Adirondack Mountain Club.   On the downside, wolf packs can wrestle large mammals such asmoose to the ground.   Putting wolves back in the Adirondacks would jeopardize thestate's efforts to revive moose, Brocke says. Also, competitionfrom another cousin may leave no room for the gray wolf in theAdirondacks.   ``The coyote has taken over the ecological niche of the originalwolf,'' Brocke says. ``We have a mini-wolf in the Adirondacksalready.''   Talk of restoring wolves and cougars to the Adirondacks ispremature, since researchers are waiting to see how the lynx fare.   ``Lynx aren't a threat to anyone,'' Gustafson says. ``If you'regoing to learn how to do something, you've got to start small.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
