A spokesman for Wang said the company's board is scheduled to meet today and an announcement is planned. He wouldn't provide further details.    But individuals familiar with the board's search committee said that Richard W. Miller, who formerly headed the consumer-electronics operations at General Electric and RCA Corp., will be named president. That post has been vacant since early this month when An Wang, the company's chairman and chief executive, forced out his son Frederick.    One board member confirmed Mr. Miller is on the &quot;short list,&quot; but declined to confirm if he would be named.    Reached at his Greenwich, Conn., home, Mr. Miller said &quot;I can't comment on anything,&quot; when asked whether he was taking the Wang job.    Naming a new president would be a second important step for the Lowell, Mass., computer maker, which Monday said it had finally negotiated a $575 million borrowing agreement with its banks.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Wang Labs Class B common stock closed at $6, up 25 cents.    Whoever takes the Wang job faces a host of challenges. The new president must slash costs from a bloated headquarters, sell assets to reduce nearly $1 billion in debt and develop a strategy to reassure customers and revive moribund sales. Moreover, three top officers have quit since Wang announced a record $424.3 million loss for the year ended June 30.    Analysts have said that naming a new president would be a vital step to revive the company. Founder An Wang is 69 years old and is working half time while he recovers from surgery for cancer of the esophagus. If named to the president's post, Mr. Miller would be the heir apparent for the top job.    For Mr. Miller, getting a shot at running a company with $3 billion in annual sales would be a satisfying turn of events after watching two previous operations sold out from under him.    During his short tenure at GE, Mr. Miller consolidated GE's and RCA's consumer-electronics business, intending to make the combined operations profitable and thus one of GE's major businesses. By most accounts, he was well on his way to doing exactly that, when GE's chairman, John F. Welch Jr., suddenly agreed to swap the business for Thomson S.A.'s medical-equipment business plus cash in July 1987.    While Mr. Welch's move was met with dismay and disillusionment by many GE consumer-electronics executives, including Mr. Miller, Mr. Miller agreed to stay with the GE/RCA/Thomson operations until the French electronics concern felt comfortable with the consolidation. In a 1988 interview, Mr. Miller said he tired of the intense world-wide travel demands of the Thomson job, turned down the opportunity to stay with Thomson for a reportedly large amount of money and quit in April 1988 to join an investment firm.    Besides looking at investments for American Industrial Partners, the investment firm, Mr. Miller has done some consulting for GE in the past year and a half. He has maintained a friendly relationship with Mr. Welch.    But Mr. Miller hasn't lost his desire to run a company during his time away from corporate life. That ambition was first frustrated in 1985 when GE agreed to buy RCA. At the time, Mr. Miller was running RCA's consumer-electronics business and was in line to run all of RCA. Later at GE, Mr. Miller hoped for a chance at a bigger GE job, but Mr. Welch again quashed that desire when he disposed of Mr. Miller's consumer-electronics business.    Thomas Willmott, an analyst who follows Wang for Aberdeen Group Inc. in Boston, noted that the Wang's family control might provide reassurance for Mr. Miller. &quot;A guy who could come in and turn around this basket case&quot; might be relieved that family control would prevent any hostile takeover or greenmail attempt, he said. The Wang family controls the company through its ownership of 80% of Wang's Class C stock, which elects a majority of the board.    Individuals familiar with the search effort, which was conducted by a three person board committee aided by executive recruiter Thomas Neff of Spencer Stuart Inc. in New York, said the search went surprisingly quickly. &quot;Good chemistry&quot; has already developed between An Wang and Mr. Miller, one individual said.    These individuals said the committee first considered offering the job to John Cunningham, a former Wang president who left the company in 1986 when told the top job would be reserved for a family member. Mr. Cunningham turned around Computer Consoles Inc., a much smaller computer maker, eventually selling it to a British computer maker and realizing a personal gain of $17 million.    Mr. Cunningham, who enjoys spending time with his family and playing golf, made it clear he would demand substantial compensation and considerable freedom to do things his way if he took the job, friends said. Moreover, he was leery of returning to a company controlled by the Wang family. Mr. Cunningham told friends that the conditions he required for taking the job made him unacceptable to the search committee. Mr. Cunningham couldn't be reached to comment yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
