Bush, the certain Republican nominee, also previewed a secondlikely campaign issue for the fall, saying he favors the deathpenalty for convicted drug kingpins. Dukakis, the likely Democraticnominee, opposes the death penalty in all cases.   The Massachusetts governor focused on trade issues as hecampaigned in Ohio in advance of next week's presidential primary,renewing his call for President Reagan not to veto legislation thatwould in part require companies to give advance notice beforeshutting down factories.   ``These people are our neighbors.'' he said of factory workerswho would be affected. ``They deserve better from their employers.They deserve better from America,'' he said.   As Dukakis campaigned in Ohio, his aides said they werebeginning to court delegates won by exiled campaign rivals with a``soft sell'' campaign. Dukakis aides have expressed confidence inrecent days that the governor will have the 2,081 delegates neededto assure his nomination by the end of the primary season on June 7.   He now has more than 1,250 delegates in the Associated Presstotal, and enjoys a lead of roughly 400 over Jackson.   Bush's remarks uttered in a trip through Indiana provided apreview of what a fall campaign against Dukakis might sound like.Jackson's remarks to an audience in Cleveland showed he was farfrom ready to give up his efforts to compete through the end of theDemocratic primaries.   The vice president, who already has clinched enough delegates toassure his nomination, criticized Dukakis on economic, law andorder and foreign policy grounds.   The vice president said Dukakis wavered initially when asked torespond to the administration's military retailiation against Iranearlier this month.   ``The president's different than anything else. You can't waitaround, hold your finger in the wind and see what the polls show,''said Bush.   Bush, who is expected to make Dukakis' relative lack ofexperience in foreign affairs an issue in the fall campaign,concluded:   ``You can't do that when you're president. You can't wait aroundto see which way the wind blows.''   Dukakis initially said he didn't have enough information tojudge the administration's actions, and said he shouldn't commentwhile he was concentrating on his New York primary campaign.   Bush also dismissed comments from Dukakis and Jackson on theimportance of fighting drugs as mere campaign rhetoric.   ``I haven't heard them talk about how tough they want to be inchanging the laws so we at least put some muscle into the law. ...I strongly favor the death penalty for the narco-traffickers,'' hesaid.   On the plant-closing issue that Dukakis has been campaigning onin recent days, Bush said his likely Democratic rival is moreconcerned about ``pink slips and plant closings'' than in creatingnew jobs.   ``I don't feel that it's midnight in America,'' he said. ``Iwant to talk about the fact that ... there are more Americans atwork than any time in the history of the country.''   Jackson, who has been increasingly critical of Dukakis in recentdays following a string of primary defeats, assailed his rival fornot wanting to classify South Africa as a terrorist state forallegedly supporting rebels battling Mozambique.   ``It exposes a lack of understanding of foreign policy,'' hesaid. ``Either (he) has a lack of understanding about the optionsin the region or he supports a policy that's inconsistent with theprogressive and democratic thrust in the world.''   Dukakis has rejected Jackson's call to provide arms toMozambique's Marxist government to fight the rebels. Campaign aideLeslie Dach said Dukakis favors diplomatic steps and economicsanctions against South Africa that the Reagan administration hasnot taken, but ``doesn't rule out possibly down the road armingfront-line states'' in their struggle with South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
