More than 100,000 people packed blocks of a broad avenue incentral Santiago on Sunday chanting ``Pinochet's going to fall!''   Police arrested 262 demonstrators and a police officer and eightcivilians were wounded, said Gen. Sergio Badiola, the governor ofSantiago. He said six of the injured, including the policeman, wereseriously hurt.   Police fired tear gas, buckshot and water cannons when tens ofthousands of people began a march on the government palace afterthe generally peaceful rally had ended.   Organizers said 300,000 people attended the rally andjournalists estimated the crowd at more than 100,000.   Gen. Pinochet, the 72-year-old army commander who has ruledChile with a military junta since a coup in September 1973, wasselected last Tuesday by himself and the commanders of the navy,air force and national police as the sole candidate in thepresidential referendum scheduled for Oct. 5.   Sunday's rally was the largest show of force by the oppositionsince Pinochet, seeking popular support, lifted on Aug. 27 thestate of emergency that restricted public gatherings.   There had been scattered street demonstrations after Pinochet'snomination was announced Tuesday and three people were shot todeath and hundreds were arrested.   Hector Moya, the main speaker at Sunday's rally, told thecheering crowd: ``We can now clearly see that the Pinochet regimealready has been defeated.'' Moya is the head of the truckers'union.   When the rally ended a column of tens of thousands of peoplemarched to the city's center, blocking traffic. Police broke up theprocession and there were skirmishes throughout the area betweenrock-throwing demonstrators and police firing birdshot and tear gas.   Pinochet, in an ``open letter to the men and women of mycountry'' printed Sunday in most local newspapers, promised fulldemocracy if he is returned to office in the referendum.   ``If Chileans call me to govern, each one of them will govern,too,'' the letter said.   In an interview printed Sunday in the conservative newspaper ElMercurio, Pinochet also promised to resign as army commander andgovern as a civilian.   Chile's 7.2 million voters are to vote either for or againstPinochet in the referendum.   If approved, Pinochet will begin a new eight-year term in March.If rejected, an open presidential election is to be held inDecember 1989 with Pinochet remaining in power until an electedpresident takes office.   Pinochet led the 1973 military coup that ousted the electedgovernment of Marxist President Salvador Allende.   Ricardo Lagos, a socialist opposition leader, called the rally``the first step toward the final defeat of Pinochet.''   Rally participants, including Chileans who have returned fromexile, sang and danced to political songs.   Among the former exiles was Isabel Allende, 44, a daughter ofthe late president, who died during the coup. She received a hugeovation when her name was announced and joined in the dancing withLagos.   Pinochet on Thursday decreed an end to political exile.</TEXT></DOC>
