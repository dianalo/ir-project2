(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican J. Marshall Coleman said todayhe will seek a recount and contest the results of the governor'srace, which he narrowly lost to Democrat L. Douglas Wilder by lessthan half a percentage point.   In official returns certified today by the State Board ifElections, Wilder received 897,139 votes to 890,285 for Coleman outof nearly 1.8 million ballots cast for a margin of 6,854 votes, or.38 percent.   Coleman's announcement came about three hours before the StateBoard of Elections announced the official results of closestgubernatorial election in Virginia history.   The unofficial returns from the Nov. 7 election had shown Wilderdefeating Coleman by 6,852 votes.   Coleman said previously he probably would seek a recount if thecertified margin of Wilder's victory was less than one half-percentof the 1.78 million votes cast, or about 9,000 votes.   Coleman had until Dec. 7 to request a recount but today was thedeadline for contesting the election to the state Legislaturebecause of alleged irregularities.   ``In an election as close as this one, irregularities whichwould not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume agreater importance,'' Coleman said in a letter to leaders of theDemocrat-controlled General Assembly.   Susan Fitz-Hugh, secretary of the board of elections, said thereis no precedent for a statewide recount. She has declined toestimate the length of time or cost of the recount, which would beoverseen by a panel of three judges headed by the chief judge ofthe Richmond Circuit Court.   Wilder has distanced himself from debate over whether Colemanshould accept the certified vote.   ``We've said all along the ball is in the loser's court,''Wilder spokeswoman Laura Dillard said.   Wilder has proceeded with plans for his inauguration Jan. 13 asVirginia's third straight Democratic governor, and has named atransition team.   The grandson of slaves and former state senator from Richmondwas elected lieutenant governor in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
