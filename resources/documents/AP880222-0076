Mayor Roberto Saturnino Braga said the mud, water and debrismade the city look like ``a giant stepped through'' the area.   Officials said the flooding, the worst in the city's history,had rendered homeless at least 11,000 of Rio's 5.6 millionresidents, washing ramshackle homes down steep slopes and turningstreets into raging torrents.   Throughout the city, army trucks and volunteers helped transportevacuated dwellers of precarious hillside shantytowns to temporaryshelters in schools, churches and public buildings.   Citizens throughout the nation, prompted by all-night appeals onthree commercial TV networks, donated truckloads of medicine, food,clothing and building supplies to the victims.   Using sledgehammers and chain saws, drenched firefighters workedfrantically early today to pull people out of the concrete remainsof a three-story, six-apartment building in the Abolicao district.   The dwelling was hit by a mudslide Sunday night that killed atleast 11 inhabitants in an avalanche of concrete and plaster.   By Sunday night, 9.6 inches of rain had fallen on the city sinceFriday, when the flooding began.   Braga postponed the post-Carnival reopening of schools and askedprivate employers to give their workers today off, saying the citycould not handle a normal flux of traffic.   Health Secretary Jose Noronha warned there might be an outbreakof leptospirosis, a group of sometimes fatal diseases that cancause fever, vomiting, anemia and bleeding of the skin and mucousmembranes. Leptospirosis is best known as Weill's or Swineherd'sdisease and is spread from animals to man. Noronha told residentsto boil drinking water and said the government would vaccinate fortyphoid and tetanus.   The building that collapsed in Abolicao was in alower-middle-class area. But most victims of the storms were poorpeople who had lived in shacks built on the city's steepmountainsides.   Water, mud and boulders washed many such shacks down the steepslopes and turned streets below into raging torrents and evenlagoons.   ``I can't even imagine what will happen to this city if therains continue,'' said Vice Mayor Jo Rezende. ``The situation isdesperate. We estimate 50,000 people will have to be given newhousing in safer areas.''   At the collapsed building in Abolicao, rescue workers trudgedthrough knee-deep mud and rubble searching for victims. At least 13people were rescued.   In another district, rescue workers were forced to temporarilyabandon their search for elderly patients and hospital staff killedwhen a mudslide wiped out a three-floor wing of the Santa GenovevaHillside Clinic.   Although 350 mostly older patients were in the hospital when theslide occurred Saturday, civil defense officials said only about 30were missing.   In the same district Santa Teresa, an eight-floor apartmentbuilding threatened to topple and was evacuated, engineers said.   Although the hillside slums that are home to about 2 millionpeople were hardest hit, wealthy areas also suffered seriousdamage. Evacuations were ordered after flooding hit the wealthyGavea, Lagoa and Jardim Botanico districts.   Torrents raged down streets, prompting some people to tie theircars to posts to prevent them from being swept away. Civil defenseworkers used amphibious vehicles and surfboards to reach people inpartially submerged cars.   Meteorologists said the downpour, caused by an Antarctic coldfront, was likely to continue through today.   Earlier this month, 207 people died in flooding and mudslidesaround the state and 13,000 were left homeless. The worst-hit areawas Petropolis, a mountain resort town 40 miles north of Rio.</TEXT></DOC>
