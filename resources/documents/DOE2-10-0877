Earliness in onesuch mutant is found to be governed by a gene system different from thatof another early, semi-dwarf, long-slender grained and high yieldinglines, TR-17. Several hundred selections combining desirable traits havebeen obtained in the progeny of the cross involving these two early parents.Differences in culm height, number of internodes and pattern of internodeelongation and thickness were observed in the promising reduced heightnon-lodging mutants of WL.112. Studies upto F/sub 2/ in 21 crosses involving13 mutants of WL. 112 and 9 genetic stocks have revealed the following.Among the mutants, two carry the same dwarfing gene sd/sub 1/ as thatof Dee-geo-woo-gen while three others have its dominant allele. The remainingeight mutants are governed by seven single genes tentatively designatedas sd/sub x1/ to sd/sub x7/, sd/sub x1/ being common in two mutants andnon-allelic to sd/sub x2/; one gene sd/sub x6/ is non-allelic to sd/sub1/; four genes sd/sub x3/, sd/sub x4/, sd/sub x5/ and sd/sub x7/ arenon-allelic to the dwarfing gene d/sub t/ of TR-5, one gene sd/sub x4/is non-allelic to sd/sub x/, of Cheng-chu-ai-11. Among the remaininggenetic stocks the sd/sub 2/ gene of D66 is non-allelic to sd/sub x'/,similarly sd/sub x''/ of Tainan-5 is non-allelic to d/sub t/ while bothd/sub x'/, and d/sub t/ are present in IR-28 dwarf.
