SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The eastern weather satellite providing thepopular cloud pictures seen in newspapers and on television is beingshifted westward after a satellite serving the western states diedfrom old age.   The loss of GOES-West on Saturday leaves the nation with just onestationary weather satellite. Another one is not due to be launchedfor at least 18 months.   ``We are going to miss GOES-West,'' said Thomas M. Pyke Jr., headof satellite services at the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration. ``The full, two-GOES system is a vital part of ournetwork for tracking hurricanes and other severe storms.''   Now, he said, meteoroligists will have ``only limited coverage ofAtlantic and Pacific ocean areas where these severe stormsoriginate.''   In addition, Hawaii and Alaska will have only partial coverage.   The failure of the satellite's imaging system was not a surprise.The instrument had exceeded its expected lifespan last May andengineers had been nursing it along.   Within two hours of Saturday's failure, information was beingreceived from polar-orbiting satellites, Pyke said. Data will alsobe available from the European and Japanese weather satellites.   While having two stationary GOES (Geostationary OperationalEnvironmental Satellite) craft in orbit gives a broader view of thenation's weather, operating with one has been done before.   For nearly three years, beginning in 1984, the western satellitewas shifted eastward after the old eastern satellite failed.   That problem was solved in March 1987, with the launch of the newGOES-East satellite.   That satellite is being moved slowly from a position 22,300 milesover the Equator at 79.5 degrees west longitude to a position at 108degrees west longtude. It should be at the new position by Feb. 21.   That move is approximately equivalent to changing from looking atthe nation from a position south of Florence, S.C., to a newlocation south of Durango, Colo.   Moving GOES-East westward will allow it to see all of thecontiguous 48 states as well as westward to Hawaii and east to themiddle ot the Atlantic. Lost will be images of the western Pacific,where storms could form to advance on Hawaii, and the easternAtlantic, the summertime breeding ground for hurricanes.   In the spring, GOES-East will be moved somewhat to the east toextend its coverage into hurricane breeding areas of the AtlanticOcean.   It is the regular images provided by the stationary GOESsatellites that are most useful for following cloud movement,tracking storms and watching for hurricanes.   Two polar-orbiting NOAA satellites remain in use, but theyphotograph each area of the Earth only twice daily in contrast tothe continual monitoring available from the GOES instruments.   The failures of two GOES satellites have been blamed on lightbulbs used to illuminate the mirrors that detect cloud cover. Thecurrent GOES-East has two light-emitting diodes in addition to twolight bulbs.   The failed GOES-West was launched in 1983 and was expected tolast, at best, until May 1988. A successor planned for launch in1986 was destroyed at lift-off when its booster rocket failed.   Although the instruments that provide the cloud photos havefailed, GOES-West is still performing other functions. It collectsdata readings radioed from buoys and land-based weather instrumentsand relays the information to the National Weather Service.   In addition, it serves as a communications relay station and willrelay data from GOES-East, from the polar-orbiting NOAA satellitesand from the European and Japanese satellites.   GOES-West cost $16 million when it was built in 1983. Thereplacement is planned for 1990 launch is part of a five-satellitepackage. That series was originally budgeted at $410 million but itnow appears that the costs will be substantially higher.</TEXT></DOC>
