Beijing University authorities tore down dozens of postersstudents had put up in the past week. The posters demandeddemocracy, an end to government bureaucracy and corruption, andbetter living conditions.   Putting up anonymous posters is against university rules.   The unrest was triggered by the slaying June 2 of Chai Qingfeng,a 22-year-old physics student who died in an off-campus brawl.   University officials allowed students to set up a small shrineto Chai in a room used for staff meetings. Dozens of paper flowerwreaths lined the small space, but the messages were non-political,expressing sorrow over Chai's death.   Students said they were not sure when they would be allowed tohold a memorial service for Chai.   The killing brought to the surface student unhappiness over poorliving conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects aftergraduation for the nation's low-paid intellectuals.   Thousands of students last week protested Chai's death by takingto the streets and calling for a pro-democracy march to centralBeijing's Tiananmen Square. Police sealed off the square to keepprotesters away.   The students said Chai was beaten to death by ``hooligans'' whenhe was buying liquor at a store, and they put up posters angrilydemanding speedy punishment of the unemployed local youths who hadallegedly killed him.   The demonstration was the largest since massive pro-democracyrallies in December 1986 and January 1987.   Hundreds of students also gathered on the campus of BeijingUniversity for impromptu debates on what broader lessons are to belearned from the incident.   The People's Daily said the State Education Commission metFriday and ordered that ``those who have violated schoolregulations should be dealt with quickly and severely,'' but it didnot say what steps would be taken.   Without specifically mentioning the unrest at BeijingUniversity, the commission said that a few students ``cannot tellright from wrong with regard to some political principles and evenopenly spread reactionary views.''   The newspaper called for increased ideological education andbetter school administration to maintain order.   ``Any words or actions that impair party leadership, discipline,stability and unity also obstruct the reforms and are against thebasic interests of the people of the whole country,'' the newspaperquoted the education commission as saying.   The commission's message also was carried by the Xinhua NewsAgency, and most national newspapers published the Xinhua report.   With the school year almost at an end, the extent of anydiscipline may not become clear until a new semester starts inSeptember.   At the university, campus bulletin boards that until Saturdaywere plastered with dozens of posters criticizing the governmentwere almost bare, with only a few notices for music recitals andgraduate school exam preparation. The few students reading thenotices said they thought the political unrest was over.   The government made it clear last week that it would not permita repeat of the massive student pro-democracy marches of 1986-87.That winter, thousands of students in Beijing and other majorcities took to the streets to demand Western-style politicalreforms to match the country's economic reforms.   Conservatives in the leadership ousted Communist Party chief HuYaobang for failing to halt the student protests quickly enough.   This time, authorities moved decisively. Within 48 hours ofChai's slaying, police tried to defuse tensions by arresting sixsuspects.</TEXT></DOC>
