In this paper a systemof computer programs which can be used to calculate the enhancementsor decrements of interplanetary scintillation caused by arbitrary interplanetarydisturbances is described. A number of the resulting calculations areshown and an example of the application of the procedure to a real disturbanceis given.</TEXT></DOC>
