SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union today expressed ``favorableinterest'' in a Western plan to boost the international role ofBerlin, according to a statement from the World War II Allies aftera meeting in West Berlin.   The statement was distributed at the end of a 2{-hour conferenceof the ambassadors of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britainand France. It was the first such meeting here since 1971.   Earlier, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl insisted Germanreunification will come one day but acknowledged such a stepremains a ``vision.''   The meeting was held at Allied headquarters in West Berlin, 100miles inside East German territory. At the 1971 meeting, anagreement was drawn up establishing the rights of the fourcountries in the city, which has been divided into four sectorssince World War II.   ``The Western ambassadors set out their proposals under theBerlin initiative. The Soviet ambassador expressed favorableinterest,'' the Allies' statement said.   The initiative, outlined by then-President Reagan in 1987, callsfor improving air traffic to Berlin, making the city the site ofyouth exchanges and international conferences. It also calls forholding the Olympic Games in the city in the future.   ``During the meeting there was a common understanding of theimportance of stability, and confidence was expressed that theUnited States, United Kingdom, France and Soviet Union couldcontribute to that on the basis of the quadripartite agreement of1971,'' the statement said. It added that further meetings may takeplace.   Those attending the meeting, Vernon Walters, Christopher Mallabyand Serge Boidevaix _ the U.S., British and French ambassadors toWest Germany _ and Vyacheslav Kochemasov, the Soviet ambassador toEast Germany, made no comment to reporters.   Kohl, attending a meeting of his Christian Democratic party inWest Berlin, said: ``We do not know when the day will come whenthis vision (of reunification) will become reality, but I amconvinced that it will come.''   The West German chancellor was due to meet U.S. Secretary ofStates James A. Baker III on Tuesday. The meeting had been plannedfor Bonn, but U.S. officials said the two would meet in WestBerlin. Baker was flying to Berlin later in the day.   At the last Four Power conference in 1971, the Soviets agreed toallow unhindered air, rail and automobile traffic between WestGermany and West Berlin. The agreement also cleared the way forcloser ties between West Germany and West Berlin.   Berlin has been in a turmoil since the Communists who led EastGermany for all its 40 years bowed to massive public pressure anddecided Nov. 9 to allow free travel to the West.   The Berlin Wall and East Germany's other borders, closed since1961 to end mass defections, were suddenly open.   In the month that followed, peaceful popular revolutions haveousted old Communist regimes from power in East Germany andCzechoslovakia, with free elections promised next year.   Kohl has proposed a confederation with East Germany that wouldlead to eventual reunification of the two Germanys. East Germany'sleaders have resisted calls for unity but say they back closecooperation with Bonn.   In the tumult, the Four Powers have been largely ignored.   At least on paper, the three Western Allies have final say inmany significant issues concerning West Berlin.   Many West Berliners want that to change, and the leaders of theWest German city-state have called for a revision of its status.</TEXT></DOC>
