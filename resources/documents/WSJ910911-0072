In his opening statementhe praised civil-rights pioneers, including Martin LutherKing Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall, for &quot;their lives,their blood, their talents. But for them I would not behere.&quot; He said, &quot;I watched as my grandfather was called`boy.' I watched as my grandmother suffered the indignity ofbeing denied the use of a bathroom and through it all theyremained fair and decent and good people.&quot;   Judge Thomas's opponents could use some of that fairnessand decency. Instead, expect more attacks by the usualmischaracterizations and mudballs:</LP><TEXT>   When are natural rights wrong? The answer, according toSen. Joseph Biden, depends on which conservative nominee he'slecturing. &quot;As a child of God,&quot; Sen. Biden told Robert Bork,&quot;my rights are because I exist.&quot; Sen. Biden yesterday warnedJudge Thomas that he'd better not embrace natural rights tooclosely.   Mr. Biden said he opposed the use of natural law as a&quot;morality imposed by the court.&quot; Conservatives would agree,but Mr. Biden's judicial heroes William Brennan and ThurgoodMarshall would not. They invoked a higher calling to declarethe death penalty unconstitutional and find rights in theshadows and penumbras of the Constitution. Only liberaljudges get to use natural rights to make up the law.   The diplomatic Judge Thomas didn't point out the hypocrisyhere, but instead explained that his interest in naturalrights was limited to his duties before he became a judge.Judge Thomas said that when he ran the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission he looked to natural-law principles toenforce the promise of equality in the Declaration ofIndependence and the post-Civil War amendments more broadlyeven than by decisions such as Brown v. Board of Education.Since even Thurgood Marshall invoked natural rights when heargued Brown, this wasn't fertile ground for Judge Thomas'scritics.   So Mr. Biden tried to get Judge Thomas to invoke naturalrights more broadly. Mr. Biden held up a copy of RichardEpstein's &quot;Takings,&quot; a recent book that analyzed theconstitutional protection against the government's taking ofproperty without compensation. Mr. Biden asked Judge Thomasabout comments he made in a speech about the importance ofeconomic liberties along with other civil rights.   What this has to do with natural rights is not clear. Mr.Epstein, a University of Chicago law professor, stresses theunkept promises of the Constitution itself, not naturalrights unconnected to the text. Judge Thomas reminded Mr.Biden, &quot;There is the Takings Clause in the Constitution andthere's also a reference to property in our Constitution.&quot; Noinvocation of natural rights is needed to find this explicitprohibition in the Fifth Amendment against uncompensatedtaking of property.   Mr. Biden correctly noted that if this clause werevigorously enforced, politicians couldn't regulate as freelyas they do now. &quot;It would be a multibillion-dollar expensefor the taxpayers if they wanted to continue to regulate theway we now regulate and consider reasonable,&quot; Mr. Biden said.He's right that taxpayers would oppose paying for all thelosses of private property caused by Congress and regulators.But it doesn't matter to Mr. Biden that private citizens,such as landowners surprised to learn they own &quot;wetlands&quot;that must be protected, must now bear the full cost of theseregulations themselves. Maybe the regulations are theproblem.   Judge Thomas told Mr. Biden, &quot;Certainly the right of mygrandfather to work deserved protection&quot; under theConstitution. Judge Thomas might have added that Jim Crowsegregation was possible only because the courts refused toenforce blacks' property and work rights. A vote for a vote?In 1980, a senator rejected the idea that &quot;every nominee upfor confirmation ought to have his or her views explored asto what his or her positions are on all the controversialissues.&quot; The senator was Howard Metzenbaum, and he wasprotecting the judicial nomination of liberal Ruth BaderGinsburg. Now Mr. Metzenbaum says that he will vote againstJudge Thomas unless he promises to uphold Roe v. Wade.   It's risky for senators to force a nominee to givepromises on cases. The Senate overwhelmingly approvedconservative Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Souter despitetheir flat refusals to make any such pledges. What makesJudge Thomas different? Also, other federal judges mightwonder about the separation-of-powers implications ofsenatorial disdain for judicial independence in lawsuitsagainst incumbents on, say, term limits and gerrymandering.   Is he a racist? Liberal groups smear Judge Thomas byclaiming that his opposition to quotas means he opposes civilrights. Better evidence comes from a plaque EEOC employeesvoted to display when he left the agency.   &quot;Clarence Thomas is honored here by the Commission and itsemployees,&quot; the plaque says, &quot;with this expression of ourrespect and profound appreciation for his dedicatedleadership exemplified by his personal integrity andunwavering commitment to freedom, justice, equality ofopportunity and to the highest standards of governmentservice.&quot; EEOC headquarters, not populated by people opposedto civil rights, is known as the Thomas Building.   Appearances of improprieties? Norman Lear's People for theAmerican Way thought it had a killer smear when it announcedthat Judge Thomas violated travel rules when he was at theEEOC. The group announced that several of his 181 officialtrips were for non-EEOC purposes. There was no suggestionthat Judge Thomas junketed or made personal trips.   Instead, PAW pointed to trips Judge Thomas made to speakat law-school functions sponsored by the Federalist Society.PAW's Arthur Kropp said this violated &quot;straightforward&quot;rules, but an EEOC lawyer said that these speeches wereroutine official business. Maybe the group will next demandthat other officials who have spoken to the FederalistSociety reimburse the government; PAW can start withPresidents Reagan and Bush.   By the time the Senate finishes its business, the largertruth should emerge that Judge Thomas has uniquequalifications for the Supreme Court, especially at a timewhen politics have infused so many legal issues. He has heldlegal positions in state and federal executive branches (inMissouri and the Education Department), the legislativebranch (for Sen. John Danforth), the judiciary (federalappeals court in Washington) and even the &quot;fourth branch&quot;(the independent agency, Equal Employment OpportunityCommission).   Judge Thomas's court of appeals rulings on subjects asdiverse as criminal procedure, utility pricing, environmentalregulation, standing and mootness are models of judicialrestraint. He closely read and applied the text of statutesand the Constitution. Not once on the bench has Judge Thomasinvoked the phrase &quot;natural rights.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
