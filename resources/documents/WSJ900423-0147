In reviewing theproduction in December of that year, I praised both the playand its author, August Wilson. &quot;The Piano Lesson,&quot; I wrote,&quot;shows a sure instinct for drama. Mr. Wilson's ear for thespeech of black Americans is unfailing: his rhythms,inflections and vocabulary capture perfectly not only theregionalisms but the rich verbal lore of his characters. Healso has his own special brand of humor.&quot; Referring to hisother plays, &quot;Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,&quot; &quot;Fences&quot; and &quot;JoeTurner's Come and Gone,&quot; I concluded that &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;would &quot;take its place alongside his other works in thisremarkable series of plays about the black experience in20th-century America.&quot;   Now, 2 1/2 years later, &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; has beendeclared the winner of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for drama;four days after the Pulitzer announcement, the play opened onBroadway. The two events, coming so long after the play'sinitial production, underscore the bizarre nature of thePulitzer drama award, especially as it affects regionaltheaters.</LP><TEXT>   In the late 1970s and early '80s, I served several timeson the Pulitzer committee that recommended a best play of theyear. In two of those years, when I was chairman of thecommittee, officials of the Pulitzer Prize came under intensepressure from regional theaters and from critics onnewspapers outside New York City to make plays produced inregional theaters eligible for the prize. (In the past, theaward had been given to the best play opening in New YorkCity during the year.) While I was very sympathetic to theargument, I pointed out the impracticality of putting it intoeffect. It's true that the Pulitzer is a national award, buttheatrical productions, unlike music, which can be heard ontape, must be seen to be judged properly. To be fair to themany new plays produced at professional theaters across thecountry the three-person drama committee would have to spend365 days a year on the road, making certain it saw every playthat was eligible.   The problem went deeper than that, however. The prize isnot actually awarded by the various committees in the arts,but by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which consists of 16 votingmembers, most of them publishers, editors and the like, whodo not feel obliged to follow the recommendations of theircommittees. To be scrupulously honest, these 16 men and womenalso would have to crisscross the country to see every singleproduction of a new play mounted by a regional theater.   My conclusion was that though it smacked of provincialism,the least unfair way of judging the best play was to stickwith those produced in a given year in New York City. Whileit was admittedly not an ideal solution, it was at least aforthright one, not leading to the hypocrisy of suggestingthat both the three-person panel and 16-member board hadactually given a full and fair hearing to each new play thatopened in the U.S. My argument did not prevail, and eversince there has been the pretense that productions nationwideare given equal consideration.   Now comes this year's award. I hasten to say that I am notfor one moment questioning the choice of &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;as a play worthy of the prize; after all, I saw great meritin it in 1987. But in which year should it have been eligiblefor the award? According to the Pulitzer board's policy ofincluding regional-theater productions, it should have been1988. Or has it decided to make this a floating contest,making a play eligible in whatever year the board whimsicallychooses? And is this fair to plays actually opening thatyear?   After its initial production at Yale, &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;was given professional productions in Boston, Chicago, SanDiego, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. It could have beeneligible, therefore, not only in 1988, but in 1989; for thatmatter, if it had not won this year, why not in future yearswhen it is produced in other regional theaters across thecountry? The arrangement whereby the Pulitzer board asksexperts in the arts to make recommendations and then reservesthe right to ignore them has always been a bit supercilious,but with this latest development in drama, the process entersthe realm of the absurd.   As for &quot;The Piano Lesson,&quot; through more than two years andsix major productions it has remained much the same, with itsmany strengths as well as a few weaknesses. The theme of theplay is beautifully dramatized. Boy Willie and Berniece are abrother and sister whose forbears were slaves in Mississippi.At one point in the family history, a mother and her son weretraded by their owners to another family in exchange for apiano, but a later ancestor, a woodcarver, reclaimed thepiano as an important reminder of the family heritage. Tocreate a lasting memorial, he carved the faces and figures offamily members into the front panels and legs of the piano.   The play takes place many years later, in 1936 inPittsburgh, where Berniece has moved to live with her uncleDoaker (Carl Gordon), a railroad conductor who owns a housethere. With her, Berniece has brought her daughter, Meretha(Apryl R. Foster), and the piano. Berniece's brother, BoyWillie, has remained in Mississippi as a farmer, but now hehas a chance to buy a farm of his own -- from the family onwhose land his ancestors have always worked. Boy Willie hascome North with his friend Lymon (Rocky Carroll) to sell thepiano and take his half share so that he can buy the farm,but Berniece refuses to sell: The piano is an icon, a familyemblem.   It is a classic dilemma: Boy Willie, portrayed withsuper-charged energy and mesmerizing charm by Charles S.Dutton, is certain his father would want him to sell thepiano to look to the future; Berniece, played with calmdetermination and assurance by S. Epatha Merkerson, isconvinced it would be desecration against the past to do so.No playwright working today can create confrontations such asthose between Boy Willie and Berniece, or such tender lovescenes as one between Berniece and Lymon, or such comicallove scenes as one involving Boy Willie and a lady of theevening (Lisa Gay Hamilton) with more authority and stagemagic than Mr. Wilson. As with his previous plays, the actorsare expertly guided by director Lloyd Richards.   As to its weak points, the play still is too long, and aghost that appears at the top of the stairs remains aproblem.   A final note: &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; is the first occupant ofthe former Ritz theater, now grandly restored and renamedafter Walter Kerr, the well-known drama critic. Its owners,the Jujamcyn Organization, say they are dedicating it to newAmerican plays. The policy has made an auspicious debut with&quot;The Piano Lesson.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
