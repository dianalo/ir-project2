The team, owned by Al Davis, is scheduled to complete the facilities for the 1990-91 season. It has a contract to play at the Los Angeles Coliseum through 1991.    Irwindale, which has a population of about 1,000, will lend the professional football team $115 million for the project. It gave team negotiators an initial $10 million when the agreement was signed Thursday night.    The city plans to finance the $150 million in construction costs through bonds and other means, and will provide the Raiders access to 160 acres at the site of an abandoned gravel pit. Irwindale is best known locally for its gravel pits.    &quot;This is great for the city,&quot; said Xavier Hermosillo, a spokesman for Irwindale and a negotiator.    The Raiders didn't provide estimates of projected revenue at the site.    Since negotiations broke down with Coliseum officials in April, the team has been wooed by several cities, including Sacramento and Inglewood, Calif. The contract was announced at Raiders headquarters in El Segundo, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
