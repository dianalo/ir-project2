The opposition alliance, sensing a victory over thegoverning Social Democrats, has vowed to break up statemonopolies and privatize hospitals, daycare centers andold-age homes, if it comes to power. Polls show theopposition in the lead.</LP><TEXT>   Economists say Sweden's giant public sector andinefficient state monopolies are draining the country'sresources and disrupting growth. Unemployment doubled in thepast year, to 3.1%, one of the highest levels in Sweden sinceWorld War II. Economic growth has stopped, and the annualinflation rate tops 9%. An average worker pays nearly 60% ofhis salary in taxes. In 1985-1990, Sweden's economic growthwas among the lowest in western Europe, and negative growthis forecast for 1991.   The conservative Moderate Party and the Liberal Party,part of the four-party opposition alliance, say they will getthe economy growing again by boosting competition,deregulating business and cutting the public payroll.   Sweden would need such changes if it enters the 12-nationEuropean Community, whose internal trade barriers are to fallat the end of next year. In July, after decades ofopposition, the Social Democratic government applied for ECmembership.   The latest survey shows the opposition gaining nearly 50%of the vote in races for seats in the 349-member Riksdag,compared with 35.9% for the Social Democrats.   The non-socialist opposition says Sweden would remain awelfare state even with the proposed changes.</TEXT></DOC>
