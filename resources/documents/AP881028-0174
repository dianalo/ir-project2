Powerful jets of water slashed indiscriminately into the crowd,knocking some people over and sending others fleeing down sidestreets.   The state news agency CTK said 87 people were arrested. Westernjournalists saw police beating some of the demonstrators with clubsand plainclothes officers twisted the arms of others while leadingthem to police buses.   Hundreds of police, some with dogs on leashes, swarmed throughthe plaza to disperse the thousands of all ages who assembled on the70th anniversary of Czechoslovak independence to demand reform andgreater freedom.   Police fired tear gas into a crowd of several hundred peoplewatching from the steps of the National Museum overlooking thesquare, which stretches for half a mile in central Prague.   A cloud of tear gas billowed under a huge, official poster on themuseum proclaiming, ``Seventy (years), all power in the CzechoslovakSocialist Republic belongs to the working people.''   CTK said the disturbances only involved about 2,000 people butsaid they also spread to the nearby Old Town Square.   ``The actions of internal enemies of socialism and debasedelements were prepared well ahead of time with the support offoreign, anti-Socialist emigre centers and publicized by Westernmedia,'' CTK said.   ``The aim of the confrontation was to cast doubts'' on officialpolicies and ``to discredit Czechoslovakia,'' CTK said.   By early evening, police trucks had moved off Wenceslas Squareinto nearby sidestreets. There was a heavy presence of uniformedpolice throughout the city center.   Friday's crowd defied a week of warnings from the communistauthorities not to attend the rally called by the Charter 77 humanrights organization and four other independent groups.   The rally followed what dissident sources described as the mostextensive roundups of dissidents in recent years, in which at least70 were detained.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Phyllis Oakley said:``The detentions show that Czechoslovakia has far to go to bridgethe chasm between the current practices of the authorities and thedemocratic ideals upon which the country was founded.''   The rally ban and show of force appeared intended to prevent aprotest similar to one of about 10,000 people Aug. 21, theanniversary of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed the``Prague spring'' of liberal reform.   Authorities reported 77 people detained after the Augustdemonstration, which riot police dispersed after several thousandpeople marched through Prague demanding ``Freedom'' and a withdrawalof the estimated 80,000 Soviet troops stationed in Czechoslovakia.   Chants of ``We want freedom!'' and ``Long live truth!'' roserepeatedly from Friday's crowd, but there were none about theSoviets.   In the 20 years since 1968, the Communist Party has been hard ondissent but kept supplies of consumer goods generous as a reward forpolitical silence from most of the 15.5 million citizens.   Current party leaders, put in power by the Kremlin after 1968,have indicated they won't adopt the sweeping reforms being promotedin the Soviet Union by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Roman Catholic activists, young people and independent peacecampaigners have become increasingly active in recent months. Policein Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, used water cannons last March todisperse about 2,000 activists who protested in a downtown squarefor more religious freedom.   On Friday, an estimated 5,000 people gathered at the rallyinghour of 3 p.m. Many chanted ``Masaryk!'' in honor of Thomas GarrigueMasaryk, who founded democratic Czechoslovakia and became itspresident. Masaryk is still held in esteem by citizens, as is hisSlovak ally Milan Rastislav Stefanik and President Woodrow Wilson,who backed their campaign for independence.   When police gave the order to disperse, they sang the nationalanthem.   Derisive whistles and shouts of ``Shame!'' filled the air as thefirst group of about 30 helmeted police with clubs moved into thesquare.   Ladislav Lis, a Charter 77 activist, appeared in the center ofthe square and cried out: ``In the name of the Movement for CivilFreedom, hurrah!'' The crowd roared support.   His reference was to a coalition of Charter 77 and other groupsorganized recently, which issued a list of 12 demands for more civiland political freedom signed by more than 120 prominent activists.   Reporters could not see whether Lis was detained in the ensuingmelee. The square was deserted after about 40 minutes, except fordozens of police vehicles and patrolling officers.   Riot police sealed the square off from side streets, where groupsof demonstrators could be heard chanting defiantly, some shouting``The world sees this!''   Those on the museum steps retreated toward the main railroadstation, where some still taunted police two hours later. Policesirens wailed through central Prague.   The poster on the museum was part of the first officialcelebration in four decades of communist rule of democraticCzechoslovakia's founding Oct. 28, 1918.   This year, authorities proclaimed it a national holiday and helda mass official rally Thursday in Wenceslas Square. The officialrally was scheduled for Thursday to give citizens a three-dayweekend.   A limited amnesty was declared, under which the government'sgeneral prosecutor said about 7,000 prisoners would be freed. AnnaSabatova of the Committee for the Unjustly Prosecuted said shebelieved only a handful of political prisoners would be among them.</TEXT></DOC>
