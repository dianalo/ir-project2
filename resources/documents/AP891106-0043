Two supporters of the rebel group that launched the attack werepublicly executed in retaliation, area residents said.   One Tamil activist warned of a ``bloodbath'' now that theIndians are gone from the area.   Sunday's fighting took place at Tampiluvil and Tamputte villages20 miles southeast of Ampara town.   Military officials, who cannot be identified under briefingrules, said about 250 members of the Liberation Tigers of TamilEelam raided two military camps run by rivals and killed 41 men. Atleast six Tigers also were killed in the fighting, they said.   The Tigers are the largest and most militant of the minorityTamil groups fighting a 6-year-old separatist war with thegovernment.   Angered by Sunday's attack, members of the Eelam People'sRevolutionary Liberation Front publicly executed two Tigersupporters in neighboring Akkaraipattu, according to residentscontacted by telephone.   Residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the twowere shot.   The camps raided by the Tigers apparently are run by a shadowygroup known as the Tamil National Army, a militia organized byformer rebel groups to keep order in the area.   A Tiger leader in Colombo, who confirmed the attack, said,``Action has been taken to dismantle the illegal Tamil NationalArmy.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity and did not eleborate.   Military officials said 140 members of the Civilian VolunteerForce and Tamil National Army were either captured by the Tigers orsurrendered during the attack. The Tigers also drove away twotractor loads of weapons, including 100 rifles, they said.   A leader of the Eelam Revolutionary Organization, a Tamil groupclosely associated the Tigers, warned of more clashes.   ``There is no proper apparatus to look the law-and-ordersituation, which means there will be a bloodbath among thegroups,'' Velupillai Balakumar told reporters today.   However, Sri Lankan Army Commander Lt. Gen. Hamilton Wanasinghesaid Sunday that troops had been rushed to the area to haltviolence.   India withdrew about 4,000 soldiers from Ampara district twoweeks ago, heightening fears of inter-Tamil fighting.   The fighting marked a new phase in the struggle by the TamilTigers and other guerrilla groups for a separate Tamil homeland inthe north and east.   Most groups gave up the armed uprising under an India-mediatedaccord in July 1987. The Tamil Tigers briefly accepted theagreement but later rejected it.   Indian soldiers came to Sri Lanka to supervise the accord. Theforce has been withdrawn in phases, and the remaining 36,000soldiers are scheduled to leave by Dec. 31.   Tamil militants are demanding a separate nation, claimingdiscrimination by the majority Sinhalese.   Tamils are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's16 million people. The predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese comprise 75percent of the population and dominate the government and military.</TEXT></DOC>
