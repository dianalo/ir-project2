The alleged securities-law violations didn't hurt any customers but did put them in danger, an SEC official said. Shearson agreed to certain remedial actions in settling the civil charges without admitting or denying them.    In a four-page administrative order released yesterday, the SEC alleged that on the six business days from Nov. 1 to 8, 1985, Shearson had unlawfully used customer securities, primarily to make improper stock loans to other firms. The agency said Shearson had loaned the securities belonging to customers before verifying that it received deliveries of equivalent securities to replace them. Shearson also improperly pledged some customer securities as collateral for bank loans, according to people familiar with the case.    &quot;The largest improper use of customers' securities occurred on Nov. 4, 1985,&quot; when Shearson &quot;used approximately $69 million of such securities,&quot; the SEC charged. The SEC wouldn't say how much stock was involved over the six days.    &quot;No customers were actually hurt, there's no doubt about that,&quot; said Scott H. Rockoff, chief of broker-dealer enforcement in the SEC's New York office. &quot;But it's important that the financial-responsibility rules are complied with in case broker-dealers have financial problems, (so) customers are protected.&quot;    In settling the action, Shearson agreed, among other things, to implement procedures to segregate customers' securities from its other securities positions and to have an auditor review the procedures over the next two years and report to the SEC. Shearson also agreed to enroll a &quot;senior supervisory person&quot; from its stock-loan department into a class concerning the SEC's customer-protection rule.    &quot;The infractions described by the SEC were technical in nature and didn't involve any loss of customer funds or securities,&quot; said a spokesman for Shearson, a unit of American Express Co. &quot;The violations were caused in large part by the failure of other firms to deliver securities to Shearson Lehman after a stock loan had been called.    &quot;Prior to today's settlement,&quot; the spokesman added, &quot;Shearson Lehman had already instituted new operational policies and procedures relating to transactions of this nature.&quot; He said that &quot;these actions will remedy the deficiencies noted in the proceedings.&quot;    Shearson noted that it is common practice for brokerage firms to use excess securities as collateral for bank loans, among other things. </TEXT></DOC>
