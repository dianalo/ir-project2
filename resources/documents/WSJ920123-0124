The tiaras turned out to be hot. The guy with the purseturned out to be Rodney Lowery, who police say is part of ashadowy band of transvestite burglars who knock overboutiques like they were bowling pins. Mr. Lowery also goesby the name Dior. When police stopped him, he was wearingshort shorts, a wig of flyaway brown curls, and a blackfeather boa, flung around his neck.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Lowery showed up for his tiara-theft trial, in statecourt here in mid-1990, wearing a flowing greencrepe-de-Chine pantsuit, by Naturally Yours of Hawaii. PoliceDetective Michael Roggin, in court to testify, thought herecognized the outfit. Sure enough, it had been grabbed in aboutique heist he had investigated the night before. Mr.Lowery got 4 1/2 years for the tiara theft, with some of thetime also counting for purloining the pantsuit, which headmitted.   Even by the balmy standards of Florida -- where theeveryday crime scene includes drug lords, arms smugglers andmoney launderers -- there is something special about abig-time burglary ring manned by female impersonators. Forseveral years now, such a group -- involving more than 100transvestites, police say -- has been preying on upscalewomen's shops in dozens of Florida towns.   The gang members steal pricey gowns and dresses -- and theoccasional tiara -- for their own use, as well as forfencing. They seem partial to beading and sequins, and, saysPepper Cain, whose Pepper's Bridal Boutique in Boynton Beachwas hit three times last year, &quot;They know labels.&quot; Sometimesthey dress as women for the heists, sometimes as men, andsometimes as a bit of both -- wearing makeup and perhapswigs, but men's clothing.   They are very adept burglars. &quot;I would estimate that theirtake, throughout Florida, is in the millions and millions ofdollars,&quot; says Detective Roggin, who says he has apprehended&quot;40 or more&quot; ring members in his three or four years on thecase, without putting any noticeable crimp in theiroperations. He adds that last year in West Palm Beach -- afocal point for the thieves -- he linked &quot;at least 25&quot;break-ins to the gang or gangs, with a haul of about$400,000. &quot;It's very serious,&quot; he says.   Merchants use stronger language. &quot;It's horrible,&quot; says awoman whose boutique in Boca Raton was hit six times in eightmonths, despite ever-increasing security measures. &quot;You justdon't know what to do.&quot; After she installed a metalanti-burglary grate inside the front window last spring, gangmembers drove a car through the glass, in an attempt to breakthe bars. They failed, and they have since left her alone.She requests anonymity, because &quot;I would just like to goforward.&quot;   Others don't have that option. Carole Chase last yearclosed her three Global Treasures boutiques, in Cocoa Beach,Vero Beach and Indialantic, after her insurance companydropped her following eight break-ins during what she calls&quot;a year of torture and hell for me.&quot; She says during thefirst burglary, a $51,000 heist in April 1990, the fleeingthieves dropped a jeweled pink gown. Two days later, gangmembers struck again, taking another $22,000 worth of clothes-- &quot;and they hand-picked that same jeweled gown out of arack,&quot; she says. &quot;They wanted that dress.&quot;   The ring's signature break-in is a lightning-fast&quot;smash-and-grab&quot; burglary, involving perhaps four or fivepeople, during the early-morning hours. The thieves typicallythrow a cinder block through a shop's front window, dash inand scoop up armloads of clothes, throw them into the trunkof their car -- which usually is newly stolen -- and speedoff. &quot;The crime takes no more than a minute or two,&quot; says GuyDi Benedetto, a police detective in Boca Raton, where thering was linked to 20 break-ins last year -- none of themsolved. &quot;By the time the alarm goes off and the policerespond, they're gone.&quot;   &quot;It's very frustrating,&quot; says Police Sgt. Robert Smith,who heads Fort Lauderdale's burglary squad and links thetransvestites to nearly $1 million of stolen merchandise inthe last year or so.   It does, however, make for some interesting police work.Detectives believe the thieves recruit new members -- andwear, sell and trade stolen outfits -- at transvestite beautypageants. Thus, last May, six law-enforcement professionals-- from three cities and four agencies, including the stateattorney's office -- hauled out to the little town ofPahokee, in the Everglades, to attend a show.   The law enforcers didn't make any arrests, but theyvideotaped, photographed and took notes on the proceedings.&quot;The host, or hostess, of the event -- he was a male, but indrag -- spoke openly about police being in the audience,&quot;says Detective Di Benedetto, who was there. &quot;He made thecomment that not all their clothes were stolen. Then helooked down at the gown he was wearing and said, `Well, maybethey are.'&quot;   (Detective Di Benedetto says the law-breaking fewshouldn't give a bad name to the law-abiding many. &quot;These arecriminals who just happen to be transvestites,&quot; he says ofthe burglars.)   Police say they have identified scores of ring members,but seldom have enough evidence to bring successful casesagainst them. Even with evidence, the cases are often settledwith plea-bargains and light sentences. Police say some ofthe transvestites are street prostitutes. Almost all usealiases.   &quot;This is a guy they call Large Marge,&quot; says DetectiveRoggin, pointing to one of perhaps 100 mug shots in a thickblack notebook of suspected ring-members. &quot;I've arrested himthree or four times&quot; on various charges. Marge is dressed asa man in this photo. The notebook says he is 6-feet-2 andweighs 250 pounds. &quot;But he's larger than that now,&quot; DetectiveRoggin says. &quot;Probably 275 or 80.&quot;   He flips to another mug shot, of a slender young personwith teased hair and careful makeup. &quot;They call him Farrah,&quot;he says.   Despite years of work, there is a lot the authoritiesdon't know about the boutique burglars. They are not evensure whether they are dealing with one ring or several. Theyhave had scant success in getting informants. &quot;They're apretty tight group,&quot; says Boynton Beach Police Detective PaulValerio. Police don't seem keen to go undercover themselves.   Some think the trouble started in the West Palm Beach areain the mid-1980s, then spread. Although the thieves preferupscale boutiques, police say they aren't averse to hittingother retailers, as well. Because burglaries are usually alocal-police matter, news of gang operations doesn't alwaystravel quickly among law-enforcement agencies around thestate. &quot;They're a lot more organized than we are,&quot; says CathyWhitaker, a crimes analyst for the Fort Pierce policedepartment. &quot;And they capitalize on this.&quot;   Crooked transvestites aren't unique to Florida. &quot;I've hadcalls from Missouri&quot; about similar crimes, says DetectiveRoggin. But it may be a commentary on the times that a largebunch of men who dress as women can run a criminal enterprisethat is -- of all things -- elusive.   &quot;If this were 20 years ago, they'd stand out like a sorethumb,&quot; says Fort Lauderdale's Sgt. Smith. &quot;But in today'ssociety, you know, it's become second nature to see all sortsof people out walking around.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
