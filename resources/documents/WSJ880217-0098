Chairman William W. Berry's once heretical corporate strategy is beginning to look like future orthodoxy in the electric-utility industry.    Meanwhile, his predictions portend an industry upheaval that will affect not just utility investors but economic planners.    Dominion's recently announced $90 million acquisition of a half interest in Enron Corp.'s cogeneration unit is the linchpin of his strategy. When the transaction is completed next month, Dominion will own as much as 50% of each of 13 power plants that, by the early 1990s, will generate a total of 2,500 megawatts of electricity -- enough to light 250,000 homes.    Nothing unusual -- except that none of the coal, gas, wood and hydropower plants will be in the territory of Dominion's Virginia Power unit. Rather, Richmond, Va.-based Dominion will supply power in Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Michigan, Texas, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.    Early on, analysts say, the 55-year-old Mr. Berry, a career Virginia Power employee, saw opportunities in the Reagan administration's push for competition and deregulation in the industry. He also recognized the long-term fallout of all those bloated-budget nuclear plants of the 1970s: that utilities would be gun-shy about building more. And he saw the attraction of cogeneration as a more efficient and, for many concerns, profitable method. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electric power and steam from a single fuel, such as natural gas or garbage.    While other utilities fought to preserve regulated monopoly status, free-marketer Berry joined forces with the enemy -- the so-called independent power producers -- in ventures to build plants in other utilities' back yards. And he encouraged independents to build in Virginia Power's territory rather than risk Dominion's capital on projects subject to the political vagaries of Virginia utility regulators.    &quot;Bill Berry anticipated where the economics of this industry were heading,&quot; says Judith Warrick, utility analyst for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Mr. Berry has studied efficiency since he became efficiency engineer at Virginia Power's Chesterfield facility in 1961. He jokes that when he gave his first speech on his free-market strategy to a large audience of industry executives and others, only three people -- an environmental lawyer, a New York regulator and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- agreed. &quot;I thought I must be wrong,&quot; he says.    But a growing number of utilities are starting to use similar strategies -- from giants like Florida Power andamp; Light Co.'s parent, FPL Group Inc., which last year joined forces with power-plant builder Combustion Engineering Inc., to little guys like Atlantic Energy Inc., parent of Atlantic City Electric Co., which has a venture with New Jersey-based Cogeneration Partners of America, which designs and builds cogeneration facilities. Dominion's partners include Houston-based Enron, which operates the nation's largest gas pipeline system, and CSX Corp., which owns gas pipelines as well as railroads and other transportation concerns.    Moreover, federal regulators are expected later this month to propose rule changes along the lines Mr. Berry has advocated to make it easier to sell power in other utilities' territories.    The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may decide to permit utilities to own as much as 100% of power plants outside their service territory while forbidding them from owning any part of a plant in their territory. Currently, they can own only 50% of a cogeneration plant regardless of its site. A new FERC rule, analysts say, would create truly competitive bidding for new generating capacity to ensure ratepayers don't pay for their local utility's construction mistakes.    Mr. Berry says that while the best opportunities currently lie along the power-short East Coast, ultimately &quot;there's going to be a national market&quot; for independent plants as the rest of the country uses up its excess capacity in the 1990s.    As a national market evolves, he says, wide differences in electric rates within and between states will disappear, with all Americans paying roughly the same. </TEXT></DOC>
