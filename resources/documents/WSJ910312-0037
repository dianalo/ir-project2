Raymond Charles Fidel pleaded guilty to two federalsecurities-fraud counts for his role in the sale ofdebentures of former Lincoln parent American ContinentalCorp., Phoenix, Ariz.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Fidel, 33 years old, pleaded guilty before federalJudge Harry L. Hupp as part of a plea-bargain agreement withprosecutors. The agreement raises the possibility that hewill aid in the investigation of Charles H. Keating Jr.,former head of American Continental, and of others with theparent or Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif.   The five-page agreement was filed under seal at theprosecutors' request, and lawyers for both sides declined toelaborate or to say whether Mr. Fidel's agreement was beingcoordinated between California and federal prosecutors.   Mr. Fidel also intends to plead guilty today beforeCalifornia state Superior Court Judge Lance Ito to six statefraud counts related to the debenture sale, according toDavid Weichert, Mr. Fidel's attorney. Messrs. Fidel andKeating and two others were indicted last September on thestate charges, to which all had pleaded not guilty.   Mr. Fidel faces a maximum federal penalty of 10 years inprison and a $500,000 fine, and could be ordered to payrestitution to bondholders. Sentencing was scheduled for May20.   In a federal criminal information Friday, the U.S. accusedMr. Fidel and others who weren't named of orchestrating ascheme in which American Continental and Lincoln employeesfraudulently led buyers to believe that AmericanContinental's bonds were &quot;safe, conservative investments in afinancially sound and secure company.&quot; In fact, Mr. Fideltold the court, he became aware in late January 1989 thatAmerican Continental was having financial troubles, engagingin high-risk investments and was considering bankruptcy as analternative.   The thrift was seized by federal regulators in April 1989,and more than $200 million of American Continental'ssubordinated debentures became almost worthless. Thedebentures were sold to 23,000 investors, many of themretired people who were customers at Lincoln branch offices.   On Friday, Great Western Bank, a unit of Great WesternFinancial Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif., agreed to buyLincoln's branches and deposits from the Resolution TrustCorp., the government agency charged with liquidating failedthrifts.   In a statement read by Mr. Weichert outside the court, Mr.Fidel said he regretted that he hadn't moved to stop the bondsale program sooner. In court, Mr. Fidel told Judge Hupp thathe shut down the program on Feb. 14, 1990.   Mr. Weichert didn't say whether Mr. Fidel would testifyagainst Mr. Keating, but said that Mr. Fidel welcomes theopportunity to tell the truth about the bond program so thatthe legal system can &quot;place the blame wherever it lies.&quot;   Last October, Tucson, Ariz., developer Ernest C. Garcia IIpleaded guilty to federal charges of bank fraud in obtaininga line of credit from Lincoln. Mr. Garcia also agreed tocooperate with prosecutors in their continuing investigationof matters related to American Continental and Lincoln.</TEXT></DOC>
