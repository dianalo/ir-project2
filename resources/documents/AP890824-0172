A Defense Ministry statement said an investigation revealed thatthe ministry denied a permit more than a year ago to Hod Hahanit, aprivate security company said to be involved in the training.   Acting without a permit would be a ``serious breach of the law,''the statement said.   The ministry said a second Israeli firm it did not identify hadviolated terms of a permit to do security work in Colombia, but thatno link to illegal activities had been established.   Yair Tsaban, a legislator from the left-wing party Mapam,demanded Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister MosheArens and Attorney General Yosef Harish appear before the ForeignAffairs and Defense Committee to explain the involvement of Israelisin Colombia.   ``I want to bring up the idea of reserve officers selling weaponsand offering training,'' he said. ``We must certainly put limits tothis and check and check again how they are working.''   Committee chairman Eliahu Ben-Elissar, of Prime Minister YitzhakShamir's right-wing Likud bloc, said a hearing would be proposed fornext week.   A Foreign Ministry official said privately that Israel offeredColombia ``all possible assistance in the struggle against drugtraffic'' and asked for all information available on the involvementof Israelis.   He said the request was made to the Colombian Foreign Ministry byMichael Ronen, charge d'affaires at the Israeli Embassy in Bogota.   Israeli media said Thursday that four Israeli mercenaries trainedparamilitary troops and assassination teams for drug dealers inCentral America.   Drug cartel assassins killed a judge, a national police coloneland Colombia's leading presidential candidate last week.   Israel television and all major dailies identified the head ofthe training group as Lt. Col. Yair Klein, 44, retired commander ofa paratroop anti-terror squad.   A government inquiry began after film was broadcast on Americantelevision showing an Israeli officer instructing paramilitarypersonnel who worked for drug traffickers.   Israeli media identified Klein as the officer and said he ran HodHahanit, which operated in South America. The company is listed inthe 1988 Israel Defense Sales Directory published by the DefenseMinistry.   Its advertisement, which identifies Klein as president, says thefirm ``specializes in fighting terrorism by establishing andtraining anti-terror units, internal security and intelligenceforces, sophisticated rescue teams ... presidential guard units, andVIP security.''   Israel television said the company began operating in Colombiamore than two years ago. It said all the company's men had left thecountry and Klein was expected in Israel on Saturday.   It said Rafael Eytan, an Israeli counterterrorism expert, deniedsuggestions that he was a consultant to Israeli companies operatingin Colombia and said he had cut all business ties to that country.   According to the report, Eytan confirmed he flew to Colombia aweek ago for private reasons.   Benny Tal, an Israeli security expert, said former commandos andparatroopers often are recruited by drug cartels.   Tal, who owns a private security firm that trains bodyguardsabroad, said in an interview that Israelis often go to the UnitedStates with dreams of making fortunes, but find themselvesunemployed.   ``If someone from a drug cartel comes to him and offers, say,$100,000 for a job, he'll do it,'' Tal said.   Tal said Israelis who train illegal paramilitary forces usuallyare offered $10,000 a month paid into Swiss bank accounts, plusexpenses in local currency.   Israel TV quoted foreign reports about a possible involvement inColombia by Mike Harari, a former chief of Israeli intelligence inSouth America and a security chief for Panama's Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega.   Harari, Mossad's former operations chief, left the intelligenceagency after a July 1973 fiasco in Norway in which his agentsmistook a Moroccan waiter for a Palestinian terrorist and killed him.   Israel TV quoted Zvi Zamir, head of Mossad in 1968-1974, assaying Harari was not involved in military training in Colombia and``one must be insane to tie Harari to drug dealings.''   Panama's ambassador to the United States, Juan Sosa, said onIsrael radio that Harari entered the United States two weeks ago ona false passport and may have returned to Panama.</TEXT></DOC>
