The system is intended to provide78 percent energy coverage for 186 apartments and to operate both asseasonal heat store and as a direct outdoor air heat pump. A completeset of enquiry documentation, consisting of 20 or so drawings, has beenprepared, describing in detail how the system should be designed. Thework has been based on comprehensive preparatory work, including geologicaland geotehnical consequence analysis, allowing the system to be ratedwith the assistance of a computer. Architectonic and acoustic considerationswere also included in the design in order to ensure that the system wouldmelt into its environment. Tenders were subsequently invited from aboutten contractors, and the replies have been used as a basis for the comparativecost calculations presented in Part 2. This includes, for example, comparisonof solar collectors with wind convectors as collectors for a heat storagesystem. Storage technology is also compared with other possible alternatives,in this case that of a straight outdoor air heat pump with wind convectors.The conclusion is that an outdoor air heat pump alone provides the lowesttotal heat production cost, and that solar collectors result in highertotal costs than a heat store with wind convectors. However, more fundamentaleconomic consideration, as seen by the supplier of electrical energy,indicates that storage technology would be preferable. This is becausethe poorer coefficient of performance of the outdoor air heat pump resultsin additional costs necessitated be reinforcement of the supply systemand electrical energy production in coal-fired and oil-fired condensingpower plant.
