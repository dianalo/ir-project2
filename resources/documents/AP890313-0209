The mining group, made up of six major and several minorbusinesses, manufactures underground equipment for the miningindustry.   For 1988, the group accounted for $227 million out of BakerHughes' $2.3 billion in revenue, the company said.   ``We have been evaluating our position in that (mining) marketfor some time,'' Baker Hughes spokesman Ronald G. Turner said today.   ``When we segregated the businesses about eight to 10 months ago,it was clearly with the intention of being better able to analyzethis segment,'' Turner said. ``And this was the conclusion based onthat analysis.''   The mining group includes about 2,000 of Baker Hughes' 22,000employees worldwide, he said.   The First Boston Corp. was retained to assist in the divestiture,and materials about the mining group were expected to be availablein about 30 days, Baker Hughes said.</TEXT></DOC>
