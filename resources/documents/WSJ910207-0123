The Maine Democrat's pronouncement came as he outlined alegislative agenda for his fellow Senate Democrats. A basicpoint of that program is &quot;tax fairness&quot; -- something that acapital-gains cut would fail to provide, he said, but thatthe payroll tax cut achieves.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It is my belief that we should proceed to engage inpayroll tax reduction,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe a large number ofDemocratic senators favor that.&quot;   Sen. Mitchell's comments, in effect, throw down thegauntlet to President Bush over the issue of who shouldbenefit if taxes are reduced this year. Most of the benefitfrom the capital gains tax cut that Mr. Bush supports wouldgo to taxpayers who earn more than $200,000 a year, accordingto congressional estimates. In contrast, a payroll taxreduction would help millions of Americans, with most of thebenefit going to low-income and middle-income people.   &quot;It's a big red flag for the Bush administration,&quot; saidSen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican onthe Senate Budget Committee. &quot;It makes it certain that taxesare going to be an issue, and that they {the administration}have to look at their whole strategy.&quot;   Major barriers still stand in the way of a payroll tax,however, and Democrats themselves are divided about it.Yesterday, House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said he has&quot;reservations&quot; about any such cut because of the revenue itwould lose. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.)said it hasn't even been decided whether lawmakers are goingto press for a tax reduction at all.   The primary reason for a tax cut would be to stimulate theeconomy. The problem with a tax cut is that it would widenthe already vast budget deficit. Rep. Gephardt said that,from the Democrats' perspective, some type of tax cut for themiddle class would be better than a cut in the capital-gainstax rate, which is currently 28% in the highest incomebracket.   The payroll tax currently stands at 7.65% on wages -- 6.2%for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare. Employers pay anequal amount. A proposal by Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.),would reduce the Social Security tax gradually to 5.2% in1996 and would raise the maximum income subject to the tax to$82,200 a year from the current $53,400.   Administration officials this week reiterated theiropposition to cutting the payroll tax, although theyacknowledge the appeal of cutting working people's taxesduring a recession.   Separately, Sen. Mitchell said he supports reducingbenefits for upper-income individuals from such federalprograms as Medicare. His position is in line with thepresident's budget proposals, which suggest tripling theMedicare premium payment for individuals who earn more than$125,000 a year and for couples with incomes of more than$150,000.</TEXT></DOC>
