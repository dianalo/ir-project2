Experiments were conducted using bothlarge (230 L) and small (2 L) microcosms where the fate of the radiolabelwas followed for up to 42 days in the water column, in the sediment reservoir,and in two species of polychaetes (Nereis virens and Nephtys incisa).Benz(a)anthracene was extensively metabolized in these microcosms, althoughthe degree of metabolism was highly dependent on how the radiolabel wasintroduced to the system and the presence of suspended particulates andan established microbial community.</TEXT></DOC>
