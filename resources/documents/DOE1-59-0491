Interpreters have to reconstruct an imaginative, 3-dimensionalconfiguration of lesions from 2-dimensional information on many films,according to their knowledge and experience. All this sometimes wastesa lot of time and gives rise to inconclusive discussion among interpreters.The advent and rapid progress of new computer graphic techniques, however,makes it possible to draw an apparent 3-dimensional image of a lesionon the basis of a 2-dimensional display; this is named a pseudo-3-dimensionalimage. After the region of interest of the CT-sliced image has been extractedby means of a semi-automatic contour extraction algorithm, multi-sliceCT images are constructed by the voxel method. A 3-dimensional imageis then generated by the use of the Z-buffer. Subsequently, transparent,semi-transparent, and color display are provided. This new method ofdisplay was used for CT-scan films of various intracerebral pathologicallesions, including tumors, hematomas, and congenital anomalies: The benefits,prospects, and technical limits of this imaging technique for clinicaluse were discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
