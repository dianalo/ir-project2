Dave Durenberger signed backdatedreal estate partnership documents to justify collecting livingexpense reimbursements from the Senate in 1983, according to apublished report today.   The Star Tribune of Minneapolis said the backdating made itappear that the Minnesota Republican's partnership with a localbusinessman was operating as the official owner of his Minneapoliscondominium in mid-1983, when in fact legal documents were notdrawn up until months later, apparently in the spring of 1984.   Durenberger's chief of staff, Bert McKasy, said an oralpartnership agreement between Durenberger and Roger Scherer hadbeen reached in 1983, and that backdating official documents ``isdone'' in that kind of circumstance.   ``What in fact happened was that in July of 1983, Mr. Schererand the senator agreed to form a business partnership, and theirlawyers did not reduce the partnership to writing until sometime inDecember of that year,'' McKasy said.   The backdating was disclosed in documents Durenberger filedvoluntarily with the Senate Rules Committee last week.   Durenberger sold his downtown Minneapolis condominium to apartnership, in which he was a member, and later to a company ownedby his former campaign manager. In both instances, he continued tolive there, but used Senate expense account funds to pay his rent.According to previous reports, Durenberger collected at least$9,947 in living expense payments from the Senate for time spent inMinneapolis from July 1983 to June 1987.   Durenberger has asked the Senate Rules Committee to review thepropriety of using his Senate expense account to pay rent for hiscondominium and has said he will repay any improper expenditures.   The Rules Committee staff believes that the senator apparentlydid not violate Senate rules with his deal, but tentativelydetermined that questions about the matter should be referred tothe Senate Ethics Committee.   The Ethics Committee already is investigating a book deal inwhich Durenberger made $100,000 between 1984 and 1986, and trips toBoston in 1987 paid for by lobbyists.   Durenberger apologized to Minnesotans at a news conference lastweek, saying he did nothing illegal but acknowledging mistakes and``lapses of judgment.''   State Sen. Bill Luther announced Wednesday that he and otherDemocrats will ask the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate thecondo arrangement, including the backdating of documents.   ``It appears that the deed has actually been backdated in orderto justify payments that were made out of the public treasury,''Luther said.   According to the Star Tribune, deeds turning over theDurenberger condo to the partnership are dated July 28, 1983. Theywere notarized by Hennepin County Commissioner Randall Johnson,then a legal adviser to Durenberger's campaign.   However, documents Durenberger turned over to the RulesCommittee indicate that, as of March 1984, Durenberger had notsigned documents setting up the partnership. He signed themsometime in mid-1984 and dated them July 1983 to reflect an oralagreement made in 1983 with Scherer, the newspaper said.   Senate records show Durenberger began filing for reimbursementfor rent in August 1983.   In a Dec. 28, 1983, letter to Durenberger, which he gave to therules panel, Johnson told him: ``It is important that you concludethe condominium transaction in order to justify the per-diem(per-day) reimbursement you received during the August recess.'' Headded, ``Everything should be dated before Aug. 1, reflecting theoral agreement between you and Roger.''   On May 15, 1984, a deed signed by Durenberger, notarized byJohnson and dated July 28, 1983, was filed at the Hennepin Countycourthouse, the Star Tribune said.   Johnson declined to comment because the matters concern arelationship with a client, the newspaper said.   Because Minnesota law requires a written document to makeproperty transfers valid, Durenberger would still have been thelegal owner of his condominium in August 1983, when he began filingfor reimbursement under the partnership arrangement that had notyet been signed, the Star Tribune said.   Four months later, Durenberger filed papers with the Senatechanging his official Minnesota residence to Avon, his family'shometown, retroactive to July 28, 1983, the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
