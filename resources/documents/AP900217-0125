Mark Delozier, one of the first officers to board the ExxonValdez after it rammed a reef last March 24, testified Friday thathe called for someone to administer blood and urine tests to thecrew after first encountering Hazelwood and smelling liquor on hisbreath.   But Delozier said his message to Coast Guard headquarters wasmisinterpreted and a state police officer was dispatched with adifferent mission.   ``He was under the impression he was supposed to come out to theship to take ahold of an unruly drunk,'' Delozier said, noting theofficer brought no testing equipment.   ``I was disgusted at the fact that we had already waited a fewhours and now he was going to be of no use to us,'' he said, notingthat the passage of time meant alcohol could dissipate from bloodand urine.   But Delozier acknowledged that Hazelwood seemed coordinated andshowed no sign of being intoxicated other than the smell of hisbreath.   Delozier said Hazelwood had ``a very intense and very obvious''smell of liquor about him and was trying to hide it by covering hismouth and drinking coffee.   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felonycount of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges ofreckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating avessel while intoxicated. If convicted, the former tanker skippercould draw up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.   Nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the ExxonValdez into Prince William Sound on March 24, killing countlessbirds, fish and wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of rockyshore.   Delozier, who boarded the ship about 3{ hours after it ranaground on Bligh Reef, said he first saw Hazelwood standing at awindow in his cabin with an elbow on a window sill and his handcovering his mouth.   Because of the confusion about sending test equipment to theship, the blood and urine tests were not taken until 10{ hoursafter the accident, he said.   Before Delozier took the stand, a forensic toxicologisttestified that Hazelwood's blood and urine tested positive foralcohol.   Michael A. Peat, of Sacramento, Calif., said Hazelwood had alevel of 0.061 percent of alcohol in his blood and 0.094 percent inhis urine.   He said the blood and urine tests almost never result in thesame figures and did not explain the significance of the amountsfound.   The blood alcohol test was under the Alaska state limit of 0.10for driving a vehicle, but over the federal limit of 0.04 foroperating a commercial vessel.   Ironically, Delozier acknowledged that he had been drinking thenight before the accident at the same Valdez bar where Hazelwood isalleged to have gotten drunk earlier in the same day.   DeLozier said he had only two light beers and did not considerhimself intoxicated but conceded that someone talking to him mighthave smelled beer on his breath.   ``Mr. Delozier, are you sure you weren't smelling your ownbreath?'' Chalos asked of the confrontation with Hazelwood.   ``Absolutely,'' Delozier responded.</TEXT></DOC>
