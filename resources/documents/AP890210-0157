Ivan Havel expressed optimisim the prosecutor won't indict hisbrother, who was arrested with eight other dissidents Jan. 16 onPrague's Wenceslas Square during a peaceful rally.   Palach Press, a London-based newsletter monitoring events inCzechoslovakia, said the fact that Havel was not released indicatesauthorities are planning to put him on trial despite a mountingcampaign at home and abroad calling for his freedom.   Palach Press also noted that Havel continues to be under arrestalthough all three possible reasons for officially justifyingcontinued detention no longer exist. These include being aparticular danger to society, influencing witnesses while at large,and the danger of repeating the offense.   Havel was arrested for taking part in a peaceful demonstration tomark the death in 1969 of Jan Palach, who burned himself alive toprotest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, and forallegedly calling for such a rally in a foreign radio broadcast.   The modification of the charges against Havel was announced byhis lawyer, Josef Lzicar, according to Ivan Havel, who spoke in atelephone interview with The Associated Press.   While a previous charge was for hooliganism, Havel is now chargedwith violating the law in dealing with instigation of other personsto commit a crime, an offense punishable by up to two years inprison.   The playwright, whose works have long been banned inCzechoslovakia, is also charged with obstruction of the exercise ofthe authority of a public official, punishable by up to six monthsin prison.   The material against Havel now goes to a prosecutor who mustdecide whether it warrants indictment. If it does he must daw up theindictment and inform the accused and his lawyer of the trial date aweek in advance, Palach Press said.   The other six detained Jan. 16 were released on Jan. 25, butthey, too, face indictment. Still in detention are Jana Petrova ofthe Independent Peace Association and Otakar Veverka of the JohnLennon Peace Club.</TEXT></DOC>
