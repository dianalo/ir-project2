ScheierandM;FORT WORTH, Texas -- American Airlines Inc. is aiming to do for its internaloperations what it has done for the travel industry -- revolutionize the wayit does business.andM;Twenty-five years after initiating its Sabre computerized reservation system,American is planning to initiate this June the $150 million InterAAct system.andM;American wants to create with InterAAct an ''electronic platform'' thateliminates nearly all paperwork, reduces hiring rates for middle managers andclerical workers and, most important, turns clerks and crew chiefs intodecision makers who will help in American's battle to elbow aside thecompetition.andM;The platform will be one universal system of interconnected PCs,minicomputers and mainframes that will eventually provide nearly all ofAmerican's employees around the world with a consistent set of tools toautomate functions now executed on a hodgepodge of equipment -- everythingfrom IBM Selectric typewriters to mainframes.andM;Users will all work from Hewlett-Packard Co.'s NewWave graphical userinterface, accessing a core of general applications as well as customizedapplications developed by American's programmers for specific, internaltasks.andM;In the long term, the private X.25 network will eventually allow American toconsolidate its Sabre and Systems Network Architecture (SNA) backbones intoone network.andM;''Ultimately, it will be a system that empowers every one of our employees,''said Max Hopper, senior vice president of information systems for theairline, based here.andM;''Middle managers are sometimes information blockers,'' he said.andP;  ''WithInterAAct, we want to let those people become leaders [and] to let employeesseek information directly so that they can make appropriate decisions in atimely manner, backed up by information and technology.''andM;In its first phase, the project will put some 14,000 networked PCs in frontof clerical workers and middle managers.andP;  PCs on Token-Ring networks, whichare in turn internetworked with Hewlett-Packard minis, will provide workerswith a central foundation for electronic mail, document filing and wordprocessing.andP;  It will also serve as a development platform for job-specificapplications.andM;Hopper believes it will help the company develop a more effectiveorganizational structure.andP;  As American expands into more cities andcountries, it's finding that its existing organizational structure isbecoming ''increasingly difficult and time-consuming'' to work within, Hoppersaid.andM;''The benefit of the computer is as a communications vehicle as opposed tooffice automation, and it enables groups to share ideas back and forth in aless formal way,'' he said.andM;The need for such interaction is growing along with the company, which, at $8billion last year, became the largest domestic airline and set profit recordsfor the industry.andM;Hopper cited the Eastern Air Lines strike as an example of how individuals indifferent departments at American need to work more closely together.andM;''How do we respond to [the strike]?andP;  Do we shift resources? Where?andP;  Today wehave to go through a lot of individuals, over a long period of time, in orderto react.andP;  We want people in different areas to interrelate and pull togetherinformation quickly,'' he said.andP;  ''InterAAct, long term, will provide thetechnology base to do it right the first time, without a lot ofbureaucracy.''andM;What's the payoff for American?andP;  The company conservatively estimates that itwill save about $27 million over a period of five years, according to MikeParks, vice president of American Airlines' Decision Technology Division.andM;Some of the savings will come from eliminating paper and from speeding up theretrieval of information, American officials said, but the real benefitsAmerican expects from InterAAct are not as easily measured.andM;''Senior management has committed goals on productivity improvements whichare measurable [9 percent per year].andP;  But even with those, we think there arefar more intangible ones that will happen,'' Hopper said.andM;Such intangibles, which will come about as American expands the system to therest of its 68,000 employees, will result from fast, universal access toinformation as well as ideas, Hopper believes.andM;''Ninety percent of the game is how you change the way people do things,''said Brad Power, a managing associate with Index Group, a Cambridge, Mass.,andO;consulting firm.andP;  ''The real challenge is yet to come -- changing thecorporate culture.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
