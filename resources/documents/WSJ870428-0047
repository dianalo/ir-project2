Only the U.S. operations of both units would be involved. The resulting company would have combined billings of about $1.2 billion, according to sources familiar with the proposal. Ad agencies traditionally have taken 15% of billings as revenue.    London-based Saatchi, the world's largest advertising agency group, didn't announce the proposal, which was made last week. But two top Compton executives distributed a memo to employees about the proposed combination. &quot;We have agreed to consider it, but will not recommend proceeding unless we are absolutely convinced it is right for our clients and our people,&quot; Robert O. Jordan, chairman, and Edward L. Wax, president and chief executive officer, said in the memo.    Mr. Wax said the proposal &quot;isn't acceptable to us at this point. The initial proposal, in effect, was a takeover, and we would lose our identity. This isn't a factory they bought, where you just take the machines and move into another building.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
