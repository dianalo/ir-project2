 This allows the current application to be capable ofprocessing images without major modifications.andP;  AS/400 ImagePlus usesstandard IBM products across standard interfaces and architectures, andisolates the application from the devices and media that are required forimage handling.andP;  Working in partnership with key customers, we took amarket-driven approach to this problem in which we developed a prototype thatdelivered a product for a specific set of customer requirements much fasterthan would top-down development.andP;  Continued participation with themarketplace to refine the product allows us to address the needs of anever-increasing number of customers.andM;AS/400 ImagePlus hardware configurationandM;Figure 1 shows a typical AS/400 ImagePlus configuration.andP;  The AS/400 systemmay be any of the available models, depending on the customer environment.andO;The Workfolder Application Facility (WAF), runs in the AS/400, and the imagesare initially stored on the AS/400 DASD, using the AS/400 PC Support sharedfolders facility.andP;  Images may be migrated to optical disk storage via abackground process that may be initiated at any time.andP;  The workstation, aPS/2 Model 50 or higher with the IBM image adapter card, provides the abilityto retrieve and display images stored on either AS/400 DASD or optical media.andO;With the addition of a daughter card that attaches directly to the imageadapter card, the workstation may perform scanning and printing.andP;  Allfunctions may be performed at a single workstation, but scanning and printingare typically performed on dedicated workstations.andP;  The scanning may be doneon a Bell and Howell Corporation COPISCAN I[TM] or COPISCAN II[TM] scanner,or an IBM 3117 or IBM 3118 scanner.andP;  Scanning speeds up to one page persecond are possible in the ImagePlus environment.andP;  The printers used are theIBM 4216 Pageprinter or the IBM 3812.andP;  An ImagePlus system is capable ofprinting images at speeds of up to ten pages per minute.andP;  The other majorcomponent, the Optical Storage Support Subsystem, includes the System/36Model 5363 attached to an IBM 9246 optical library and/or IBM 9247stand-alone optical drives.andP;  The System/36 Model 5363 serves as the opticalcontroller.andP;  All components are connected via the IBM Token-Ring Network.andO;Workstations communicate with the AS/400 PC Support and workstation functionproducts.andP;  Configurations utilizing multiple AS/400 processors are possible.andO;Multiple optical processors are also an option.andP;  The complete configurationmay have as many as six processors.andP;  For example, a large AS/400 ImagePlusconfiguration could have two AS/400s and four Optical Storage SupportSubsystems.andM;AS/400 ImgaPlus operational conceptsandM;Figure 2 shows a high-level view of an ImagePlus operational environment.andO;The scanner operator receives paper documents from the mailroom in batches ofsimilar types of mail.andP;  This operator selects scanning via the WorkfolderApplication Facility (WAF) menus and operates the scanner to scan and verifythe document.andM;An indexing operation may be performed separately or in conjunction withscanning.andP;  This operation creates a new case, i.e., logical collection ofdocuments, for the document or matches the document with an existing case.andM;Image operators select a case, view the documents, and access existingline-of-business (LOB) applications to perform whatever operation isnecessary to complete the transaction.andP;  In performing the transaction, theimage operator may close a case, reassign it, or suspend it while waiting forfurther information or some event to occur.andM;Scanned documents are initially stored on the AS/400 DASD.andP;  An asynchronousoperation is initiated to place a copy of the image on optical storage.andP;  TheDASD copy may be erased when the case is closed or suspended, leaving onlythe optical copy, which may be stages for retrieval to support furtherprocessing.andM;AS/400 ImagePlus processingandM;Figure 3 shows a high-level view of the interaction between the majorcomponents of the AS/400 ImagePlus system.andP;  We now discuss the key elementsof ImagePlus processing.andM;Workfolder Application Facility.andP;  The Workfolder Application Facility (WAF)provides the case/folder application interface with the end user.andP;  It alsoprovides a menu-driven interface and sends commands to the image workstationto initiate the scanning, printing, or display of a document.andP;  The WAFinterfaces with the Optical Storage Support Subsystem to cause the storageand retrieval of images.andP;  WAF is discussed in more detail in the followingmain section.andM;ImagePlus Workstation Program.andP;  The ImagePlus Workstation Program isdiscussed in detail in Reference 1.andP;  This program interfaces with thescanning, printing, and display hardware.andM;Scanning is the process of converting a paper document into a raster imageand is performed at a workstation with one of the three types of scannersattached.andP;  This workstation requires an image adapter card, as required atall image workstations, plus a daughter card to provide scanning capability.andO;Documents are scanned at 200 or 240 picture elements (pel) per square inchand displayed at 100 picture elements (pel) per square inch at the imageworkstation.andP;  Images are compressed, using a Modified Modified READ (MMR) orInternational Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) Group 4compression algorithm.andP;  They are then converted into the IBM Image ObjectContent Architecture (IOCA) format, wrapped in a Mixed Object DocumentContent Architecture (MO:DCA) envelope, and stored on AS/400 DASD.andP;  Documentsmay consist of one or more pages.andP;  As each page is scanned, it is displayedfor quality checking.andP;  Pages may be rejected and rescanned after adjustingthe contrast and intensity controls on the scanner.andP;  After all the pages of adocument have been scanned, the operator accepts the document by pressing theEnter key, and the document is stored on the AS/400 system using the PCSupport shared folders.andM;Printing documents is performed at workstations, with one of the supportedprinters directly attached to the image adapter.andP;  This process also requiresthe special daughter card.andP;  Documents may be printed individually or as partof a case.andP;  The ability to merge coded data, stored in Presentation TextObject Content Architecture (PTOCA) format, with an image for printing isalso provided.andM;Displaying documents may be performed at any of the image workstations.andP;  Whendocuments are requested for display, WAF sends the path address to the imageworkstation.andP;  The workstation program retrieves the document from the AS/400DASD or from the optical storage library and displays it on the imagemonitor.andP;  The path address sent is the same as the one established at scantime.andM;Document storage and retrieval is performed as a background operation.andP;  Abackground STORE process for placing a copy of the DASD image on optical diskstorage may be executed during the scanning process or may be run during anoff shift.andP;  This process uses WAF-to-optical-storage interface, which isdescribed later in this paper.andM;During a case processing, the DASD copy of an image may be deleted.andP;  Ifimages are required for processing, a retrieve process is provided thatplaces a copy of the archived optical image on AS/400 DASD.andP;  In most cases,this is done through a staging process that makes the documents available fordisplay after they have been retrieved.andP;  Occasionally, when an imageprocessing operator requires the interactive display of an image notavailable on AS/400 DASD, retrieval is done directly from the imageworkstation software and is transparent to the operator.andP;  These retrievals,termed ad hoc retrievals, lengthen the response time, because time spentfinding, accessing, and transmitting an image to the workstation is time thatthe image operator is waiting for the display request to be satisfied.andM;Optical Storage Support Subsystem.andP;  The Optical Storage Support Subsystem isbased on the System/36 System Support Program (SSP), which is modified toallow attachment to an optical storage library and individual optical drives.andO;The Optical Storage Support Subsystem communicates with the applicationenvironment in the AS/400, IBM PC, or IBM PS/2 system through the System/36shared folders function.andP;  The Optical Storage Support Subsystem makes up to128 gigabytes of on-line optical storage available to the ImagePlus systemfor the storage of images.andP;  Optical platters that have been removed to makeroom for new platters continue to be managed by the Optical Storage SupportSubsystem.andM;Hardware components of the Optical Storage Support Subsystem include thefollowing parts.andP;  A FileNet[TM] Optical Storage and Retrieval (OSAR[TM]) 64Model 0100 Library provides 64 bins for storage of optical disk cartridgesand may hold up to four optical disk drives.andP;  The library is attached to theModel 5363 via the standard System/36 5363 ASYNC adapter.andP;  The OSAR provides128 gigabytes of optical storage to the ImagePlus system.andP;  The Laser MagneticStorage International Company (LMSI) LaserDrive[TM] 1250E Optical Disk Driveis used in the optical library, and a LaserDrive 1200E Optical Disk Drive isused as the stand-alone drive.andP;  These drives can access one side of anoptical platter at a time.andP;  To access the other side, the platter must beremoved, rotated, and reinserted.andP;  In the OSAR, these actions are provided byrobotics under the control of the Optical Storage Support Subsystem withoutoperator intervention.andP;  The drives are attached to the 5363 through the IBMSystem/36 5363 Optical Disk Drive Adapter.andP;  The Optical Storage SupportSubsystem allows for the configuration of up to two adapters on an IBMSystem/36 5363.andP;  A single adapter can support up to seven optical drives ineither a stand-alone mode or through the optical library.andM;Optical disk cartridges used with the LMSI drives use write-once-read-manytechnology.andP;  The twelve-inch platters are kept inside cartridges for ease ofhandling; the platters are two-sided, and both sides are used by the OpticalStorage Support Subsystem.andP;  Each side of an optical disk has a one-gigabytecapacity and is treated as a separate logical volume.andP;  The logical format ofa platter consists of one million 1024-byte sectors.andP;  Sectors allocations areas follows: volume label (contains volume name); subdirectory (contains pathaddresses of object directories); data area (contains Document ObjectDirectory which is sector addresses of the 960 objects per directory block);and document objects.andM;Software architecture includes the Optical Storage Support Subsystem, whichintroduces the concept of a media folder to enable the storage and retrievalof objects on optical volumes or diskettes (media).andP;  The media folder issimilar to a System/36 document folder.andP;  The difference is that the membersin the media folder do not permanently reside on the System/36 disk device.andO;They are initially written on the media folder and later copied to thespecified media and then deleted from the disk.andP;  The Optical Storage SupportSubsystem intercepts OPEN and CLOSE requests for members that are containedin a media folder and passes them to the media folder manager.andM;Media folder manager determines the status of the data object and the type ofactivity requested, which may be of the following three types:andM;* Writing an object to a media folderandM;* Reading an object that is not in the staging areaandM;* Reading an object that is in the staging areaandM;Stage manager is responsible for moving objects between an optical volume anddisk device media folder.andP;  Requests generated by the stage manager are sentto a program known as the optical function manager.andM;Optical function manager initiates the I/O operations to satisfy the requeststo read or write an object on the optical library.andP;  Requests are queued andsent to the optical I/O manager.andP;  The optical function manager maintains theoperational relationships between optical volumes, library bins, and opticaldrives in order to check the current status of the requested optical volume.andO;The optical function manager uses functions provided by the media indexmanager to locate an object on a specific optical disk.andP;  The media indexmanager and the optical I/O manager are discussed in the following twoparagraphs.andM;Optical I/O manager converts optical I/O function requests into library andoptical drive requests that are directed to the library robotics throughlibrary microcode.andM;Media index manager determines which optical volume contains the requestedobject data.andP;  The object-to-volume correspondence is maintained in a set oftables.andP;  Two of the tables used by the media index manager are thepath-volume relationship (PVR) table and the volume-to-address reference(VAR) table.andP;  The PVR maps the logical object name to its related mediavolume and the VAR contains the physical location of the optical volume.andM;Workfolder Application Facility processingandM;The Workfolder Application Facility (WAF) is the front-end application to theAS/400 ImagePlus system.andP;  WAF provides an easy-to-learn-and-use menu-drivenuser interface with extensive help facilities.andP;  WAF also provides anextensive set of user exits and application program interfaces.andP;  The WAFapplication initiates the scanning of documents into the system and allowsthe images to be viewed concurrently by the users of the system.andP;  Thedocuments may be processed individually or placed on a work queue.andP;  The casemanagement aspect of WAF provides a system of work queues that allowstransactions (cases) and their associated images to be routed to individualsresponsible for performing the type of work required by the transaction.andP;  WAFalso provides the capability for simple document storage and retrieval.andO;Because this is a database-driven application, WAF is highly adaptable todifferent user environments.andP;  A series of system and application profilesallows the user to specify:andM;* Document typesandM;* Work queuesandM;* User capabilities and authorizationsandM;* System processorsandM;WAF comprises six major functions.andP;  Two of these, input processing, andworkfolder/case processing, provide interactive day-to-day processing.andP;  Theothers--administration, system services, output, and backup/recoveryprocessing--provide the administrative and system management functionsrequired to establish and maintain system operations.andM;Folder architecture.andP;  Figure 4 shows the basic WAF workfolder architecture.andO;The term workfolder is synonymous with case, but it is used to differentiatebetween a transaction-oriented case and a document repository or workfolder.andO;The case is the primary unit of work within WAF, and it represents a logicalcollection of documents of one or more pages related by a unique identifier.andO;The identifier, entered during indexing, associates the case with a specificcustomer or account.andP;  Multiple cases may exist for any identifier.andP;  Each caseis assigned a unique case ID when it is created.andP;  The case ID is used by WAFto control work flow.andP;  The case may relate to a short-lived transaction or toa long-term workfolder that is intended to act as a repository for documentsrelated to a particular customer.andP;  The mechanism that defines whether adocument initiates a short-term transaction (case), or is placed in arepository for documents that are filed (workfolder), is the document typeprofile, which is described later in this paper.andP;  An example of this is anautomobile insurance policy.andP;  The original application is stored in awork-folder that remains active for the life of the policy.andP;  Occasionally newdocuments, such as changes to the policy, must be filed with the workfolder.andO;When a claim is filed against the policy, that claim initiates a new caserelated to the policy by policy number.andP;  All the documents related directlyto a claim become part of the case.andP;  The case related to the claim may beplaced on a work queue and be processed through the management capabilitiesof WAF.andP;  When the claim is satisfied, that case is closed.andM;Configuration control architecture.andP;  One of the main strengths of theImagePlus system is adaptability.andP;  Three elements of WAF provide the means toimage-enable any customer environment:andM;* System and application profilesandM;* User exits that link WAF to customer applicationsandM;* Application program interfaces (APIs) that allow access to image functionandM;User exits and APIs are discussed in a later section.andP;  The key to adaptingWAF to the customer environment is the WAF profiles, which are a series oftables completed by the customer during system installation that allow thecustomer to define the processing characteristics and system configuration toWAF.andP;  WAF profiles are created and maintained through a screen-driveninterface and may be updated at any time.andP;  Figure 5 shows examples of theuser ID profile and the document type profile.andM;User profiles make it possible for each user to be identified to WAF bycreating a profile that contains the user ID.andP;  The user profile describes toWAF the functions available to that user, and allows WAF to restrict useraccess to queues, document types, and specific functions.andM;Document profiles identify and describe each type of document and the rulesfor the management and usage of each document type.andP;  When new documents arescanned into the system by WAF, they are always assigned a document type.andO;Based on the document type, WAF can make the following types of decisions:andM;* When a document is indexed, should a new case be created or should it beinserted into an existing case?andP;  For example, a loan application form mayalways create a case, but an appraisal form should always be inserted into anexisting case.andM;* Should a document be stored on an optical medium?andM;* How many days should this document stay on DASD if the folder containing itis inactive?andM;* Can the user PEND a case for a particular document type?andP;  (PEND is anaction to suspend.)andM;* If a case is in a PEND state for this document type, should WAF remove thedocuments in the case from DASD, while it waits for the incoming document?andM;* Which users can view documents of a particular type?andM;* If a new case is created, should that case be queued for work?andP;  If so, whatshould be the default queue?andM;Queue profiles define valid WAF work queues.andP;  Queues are of two types: (1)general queues, which are shared and can be accessed by anyone having accessto a given queue class; and (2) user queues, which are specific to andaccessible only by a specific user.andP;  The queue profile also allows for analternate queue, whereby the systems administrator or manager can reroutework from a queue of someone who is sick or on vacation into another queue.andM;Processor profiles define each CPU in an ImagePlus configuration.andP;  The AS/400ImagePlus system is a multiple processor.andP;  A single ImagePlus configurationsupports up to six processors.andP;  The six CPUs may be a mix of AS/400 and 5363and optical library processors.andP;  The profile defines the processor ID foreach of the attached processors.andP;  The processor ID forms the drive ID portionof the path address for images and allows each processor to be accessed by aPS/2 workstation.andP;  In addition, the profile record indicates to WAF whether aparticular AS/400 processor is the primary system containing the WAFdatabases.andM;Optical profile identifies the optical subsystem(s) in an ImagePlusconfiguration.andP;  It also defines the processor ID of the optical subsystem andallows the workstations to have direct access to the documents stored onoptical disk.andM;Folder profiles identify the AS/400 system shared folders that are to be usedfor storage of image documents.andP;  These storage locations are used by WAF asaccess paths to the documents.andP;  An access path is really a PS/2 directoryname and subdirectory name.andP;  This path and the document name is sent to theimage workstation when documents are written during scanning or read duringdisplaying and printing.andP;  The actual folders are created using AS/400 sharedfolder utilities.andM;Input processing.andP;  To become an ImagePlus document, a paper document must bescanned and then indexed into the WAF application.andP;  Each document scannedmust be accompanied by an identifier and must be one of predefined documenttypes.andP;  The identifier must be known to the customer's line-of-businessapplication, if one exists.andP;  This identifier is used as the primary indexinto the WAF application.andP;  Each case in WAF must relate to a specificidentifier.andP;  Indexing uses an identifier (Social Security number, claimnumber, invoice number, account number, etc.) that is keyed by the scanner.andO;The identifier is used to process the document according to the rules for thetype of document being indexed.andP;  Document types are established by thecustomer at installation and are maintained in a document type profile.andO;Indexing follows one of the following three rules for indexing documents:andM;* Begin a new case (type 1).andM;* Insert the document in an already established case for that identifier(type 2).andM;* Insert a document into a case if one exists for that identifier; if noneexists, create a new case (type 3).andM;Indexing places a case on a work queue as an active case if a queueidentifier is supplied by the indexing operator.andP;  If no queue identifier isprovided, the case is filed as an open workfolder.andM;During case processing, it may be necessary to PEND a case by setting itaside while waiting for an event or for a document to allow processing to becompleted.andP;  When a type 2 or type 3 document is indexed and such a documentsatisfies a PEND requirement, it is merged with the case and the case isrequeued to the image operator who is waiting for the PEND requirement to besatisfied.andM;The create empty case function of WAF allows a case to be created when nodocuments exist to be scanned.andP;  The capability also exists to add aprescanned form to the case interactively.andP;  This form may also be completedon line by keying data that are stored in the case and then merged with theimage when the document is to be displayed or printed.andM;A series of user exits available during indexing allow the following actions:andM;* Determination of the proper identifier by a customer applicationandM;* Validation of the identifierandM;* Addition of user-defined keysandM;* Importing of line-of-business data into the WAF databaseandM;Workfolder and case processing.andP;  WAF functions in two modes: (1) thecase-processing mode, in which documents scanned and indexed into the systemare associated with active cases and placed on a work queue for processingimmediately; and (2) the electronic folder storage and retrieval made, inwhich documents are filed in workfolders being maintained in an open statusfor access on demand.andP;  The latter are referred to as workfolders todistinguish them from the short-term transactions that are represented by theterm case.andP;  Figure 6 shows the flow of work through WAF workfolder and caseprocessing.andP;  Workfolders and cases are selected for processing by an imageoperator either by selecting a queue (case-processing mode) or by selecting aspecific workfolder (electronic folder-storage and retrieval mode).andP;  Afterbeing selected as being worked, the workfolder and case are not available tobe worked by other image operators.andM;When a case or workfolder is selected for processing, a screen is presentedthat lists all the documents that the image operator is authorized to see.andO;Figure 7 depicts the screen presented to the image case worker.andP;  Using thenumbered document-related options or the PF-key case-related options, theimage operator may select one or more of the documents for display andperform the action required by the line of business (LOB).andP;  A separatesession may be available in which the operator accesses an LOB database,either on the same AS/400 or on some remote system, where transactions areperformed, based on the documents in the case.andM;For example, the image document may be a letter from a customer requesting anaction be taken on the customer's account.andP;  The image operator, using adesignated &quot;hot key,&quot; may switch to another workstation session on which toaccess the customer's account in the LOB database.andP;  There the operatordetermines whether sufficient information exists to resolve the problem.andP;  Ifthere are insufficient data, the image operator may PEND (suspend) the case,awaiting a specific document or for some amount of time to elapse.andP;  In a PENDstate, the case is removed from the image operator's queue and placed on aPEND list.andP;  When the required document arrives, it is scanned and matchedagainst the PEND cases.andP;  If matched, the case is automatically reactivatedand placed back on the queue designated when the PEND action on the case tookplace.andP;  The image operator may then complete the requested action and CLOSEthe case.andP;  A REASSIGN function exists to allow cases placed in the wrongqueue to be assigned properly.andP;  This function also allows an image operatorto ask a question of a supervisor by placing the question in the comments forthe case and reassigning it to the supervisor by the REASSIGN command.andP;  Thesupervisor, in turn, answers the question via the case comments andretransmits the case back to the image operator via REASSIGN.andP;  Theflexibility of WAF allows a broad range of workfolder processing applicationsto be implemented.andM;Output processing.andP;  During the course of processing, an image operator mayrequest the printing of a document or a case through the DEMAND-PRINTBATCH-PRINT functions.andM;The DEMAND-PRINT option is used to print individual documents wheneverrequired in the work-flow process.andP;  DEMAND-PRINT requests are placed in thequeue specified in the image operator's user ID profile and routed to aspecific printer when the DEMAND-PRINT processor is started.andM;The BATCH-PRINT function allows complete cases to be printed.andP;  The imageoperator may specify which documents are to be printed, and the operator mustalso select a prescanned form to be printed, preceding the selected case.andO;The form may include system data such as date and coded data (entered at thetime of the print request) and/or data from the WAF user data file.andP;  Thepredesigned form (stored as an image) and the coded data (stored as aPresentation Text Object Content Architecture--PTOCA--record) are merged atprint time and the data stored in the folder for that identifier.andP;  Batchprint requests must be preprocessed, creating print spools that are selectedfor printing on one of the dedicated print workstations.andM;Interfaces.andP;  As depicted in Figure 8, the AS/400 ImagePlus system is made upof several components, including the following:andM;* AS/400 standard hardware and softwareandM;* Optical Storage SubsystemandM;* Image workstation and the ImagePlus Workstation ProgramandM;* Workfolder Application Facility (WAF)andM;The IBM Token-Ring Network is the means of communication between theImagePlus components.andP;  PC Support is the vehicle for communication and isinstalled on the AS/400, the ImagePlus workstations, and the System/36 5363(using AS/400 PC Support/36 Coexistence).andP;  The workstations communicate tothe AS/400 via the AS/400 router and pass through the AS/400 using AdvancedProgram-to-Program Communication and Advanced Peer-to Peer Networking(APPC/APPN) support to the 5363.andP;  The WAF store and retrieve processes useAPPC to communicate between the AS/400 and the 5363.andP;  The followingparagraphs describe the interfaces between the ImagePlus components.andM;WAF to image workstation interface.andP;  When an ImagePlus workstation undergoesIPL, it first starts DOS and standard PC Support communications.andP;  Thisincludes the following: starting APPC communications via the PC Supportrouter; starting shared folders sessions (virtual PC drives); and startingthe AS/400 terminal emulator (workstation function) that provides the AS/400terminal sessions for the user.andP;  After all these functions have started, theImagePlus Workstation Program starts and becomes the PC DOS program.andP;  TheImagePlus Workstation Program then goes into a wait state, waiting to receivecommands.andP;  The ImagePlus Workstation Program functions only in response tocommands from WAF as a result of a menu request or via the applicationprogram interfaces (APIs).andP;  The user would then HOTKEY to the AS/400 terminalsession, sign-on to the AS/400, and start the WAF.andP;  When WAF is executing--inresponse to end-user menu selections--it sends commands to the the ImagePlusWorkstation Program via a special command interface.andP;  When a command isreceived, the ImagePlus Workstation Program takes control of the workstation,executes the command and sends a response back to WAF.andM;The WAF-to-workstation interface includes the following commands:andM;* SCAN--Causes the ImagePlus Workstation Program to scan a document and storeit on the AS/400.andM;* DISPLAY--Causes the ImagePlus Workstation Program to display a documentfrom the AS/400 or the optical subsystem.andM;* PRINT--Causes the ImagePlus Workstation Program to print a document fromthe AS/400 or the optical subsystem.andM;* RESET--Deletes the current set of image documents from the workstation.andM;* KEYS--Keystrokes the second user terminal session (LOB host session)andM;* SET CONFIGURATION--Defines a number of parameters that are required tocontrol scanning or printing.andM;These commands provide all of the image workstation processing functions forWAF.andP;  WAF is always in control, with the workstation as a slave requestprocessor.andM;Image workstation to LOB application interface.andP;  AS/400 PC Support allowsfive sessions on the ImagePlus workstation.andP;  The user switches between thesesessions through the use of the hot key, Alt-Esc.andP;  Session 1 is designated asthe WAF session; session 3 is the image session.andP;  Session 2 is the hostsession, which may be used to communicate with the user's LOB application.andO;This application may be coresident in the AS/400, in a remote AS/400, or inanother mainframe, such as the System/370.andP;  The emulation of a 3270 from theAS/400 may be used to communicate with the remote location.andP;  Sessions 4 and 5may also be used for user applications.andP;  Any AS/400 or mainframe session maybe started from these sessions.andP;  PC applications may be started only if thethe image workstation program software is terminated first.andM;Image workstation to AS/400 shared-folders interface.andP;  The commands thatprovide the interface between the ImagePlus Workstation Program and the WAFuse document paths and document names.andP;  Consider the example in which the WAFsends a SCAN command to the ImagePlus Workstation Program and tells theImagePlus Workstation Program that the path for the scanned document isD:\FOLDER01\WAFSBDIR.001\ and that the document name is A3891101.001.andP;  TheImagePlus Workstation Program then processes the scan command and stores thedocument under the specified name in the specified location using standardDOS calls (interrupt 21).andP;  The interface used to store the documents on theAS/400 DASD is PC Support shared folders.andP;  PC Support device drivers trap theDOS calls and transfer the documents into AS/400 system folders.andP;  Theshared-folders interface provides shared access to all documents on theAS/400, thereby allowing the workstations to access up to 36 gigabytes ofDASD.andP;  In addition, the shared-folders interface on the optical subsystemprovides access to all the documents stored on optical disk, which could beof the order of magnitude of terabytes.andP;  Errors in accessing objects throughshared folders are passed back to WAF via the command interface.andM;WAF to Optical Storage Subsystem interface.andP;  To facilitate the storing ofdocuments on the Optical Storage Subsystem, after they have been written toDASD by the ImagePlus Workstation Program and the retrieving of documentsback to DASD from the optical subsystem, a requestor/server interface wasdeveloped between WAF and the 5363 optical controller.andP;  This interface isshown in Figure 9.andM;The request processors are WAF programs which run on the AS/400 and use APPCto send the documents to the 5363 Optical Storage Support.andP;  The WAF has onerequest processor for storing documents, the optical library store program,and one for retrieving documents back to DASD, the optical library retrieveprogram.andP;  The store and retrieve requests are created by various componentsof WAF.andP;  For example, when a document is scanned and stored, WAF creates astore request, and, when a case is closed, a delete request is generated forthe documents of the case.andM;The request processes evoke the optical server programs that run on the 5363Optical Storage Support using APPC commands.andP;  One server program isresponsible for creating new optical media folders, and another createsdocuments in the media folders and retrieves the documents from the mediafolders.andP;  The Optical Storage Support software actually writes the documentson the optical platters.andM;WAF external interfaces.andP;  The key to a successful image processing product isits ability to integrate with the application systems that support thecurrent business process.andP;  The replacement of paper by an automated imagesystem can greatly enhance the current data system by electronically tyingactual documents with the line-of-business records.andM;AS/400 ImagePlus provides two methods to facilitate this integration: (1)Workfolder Application Facility exits and (2) application program interfaces.andO;The exits are user-written routines that are called by WAF at selected pointsin the WAF process, such as when a document is scanned and indexed.andO;Application program interfaces are subroutines that user applications cancall to provide image and document-handling functions to the actual userline-of-business application.andP;  An example of this is the display of theinvoice document that corresponds to a specific purchase order.andM;WAF provides nine exits that may be called when the user causes particularfunctions of WAF to be executed.andP;  WAF passes a set of parameters to the userexit and expects a set of parameters returned.andP;  The nine WAF user exitsprovide the following capabilities:andM;* A create-identifier exit, which passes the value entered by thescanner/indexer to the user program, and allows the user program to return anidentifier to be used to index the documentandM;* A start/stop-indexing exit, which allows the user to establish or releasecommunication paths to a host application for document indexingandM;* A create-case exit, which allows the user to validate the identifier thatwas keyed by the indexing operator, create additional index fields, and addinformation associated with the identifier to a user file in the WAFdatabase.andP;  This exit is called for those document types that cause a new caseto be created.andM;* A batch create-case exit, which provides the same function as the previousexit but communicates with a version of the indexing program that runs in thebackgroundandM;* An insert-document exit, which allows the user to validate the index keyed,create additional indexes, and determine to which queue a case should beassigned.andP;  This exit is called for document types that will be merged withexisting cases.andM;* A search-case exit, which allows the user application to determine the casethat should be displayed.andP;  This exit is used in conjunction with thecreate-case exit that creates the user indices.andM;* Three function-key exits, which allow the operator to access user-writtenapplications while processing WAF casesandM;In many application scenarios, the current line-of-business applications canbe image-enabled, while shielding the user from WAF screens.andP;  The applicationmay already have a work-processing system or a document indexing system thatsimply needs access to image functions.andP;  To facilitate this, WAF providesworkstation application program interfaces (APIs).andP;  These APIs provide theinterface to the image workstation, the optical subsystem, and the WAF foldermanagement.andP;  The API commands are the following:andM;* SETC sends the workstation configuration command.andM;* SCAN sends the workstation scan command.andM;* SENDOBJ sends the workstation display command.andM;* RESET sends the workstation reset command.andM;* PPRTOBJ sends the workstation print command.andM;* PRINTOBJ puts a print request on the demand print queue.andM;The storage management API commands are as follows:andM;* STOROBJ creates an optical store request.andM;* FETCHOBJ creates an optical retrieve request.andM;* DLTEOBJ creates a DASD delete request.andM;The folder-management API commands are the following:andM;* INDEXOBJ indexes a document.andM;* DEFFOLD creates a case.andM;* DEFSTOBJ adds a document to a case.andM;* RMVOBJ removes a document from a case.andM;* FINDOBJ lists documents in a case.andM;* CRTOBJ creates a new document record.andM;Concluding remarksandM;The ImagePlus system has demonstrated in live, full-production environmentsthat it is possible to manage the large quantities of visual information notcurrently handled by existing systems.andP;  ImagePlus has succeeded in capturingthe vast amount of visual information used in business processes andpresenting it in a familiar and controlled manner.andP;  This allows theapplication of standard database and information processing techniques.andM;The AS/400 ImagePlus system is built on existing IBM architectures andproducts.andP;  The SNA communications architecture and the document-content andPS/2 architectures provide the building blocks.andP;  The AS/400 PC Support andfolder-management functions provide the backbone to tie new capabilitiestogether.andP;  The new Workfolder Application Facility (WAF) and ImagePlusWorkstation Program products provide powerful new tools that allowenterprises to remove paper from their desk tops and move the document imagesquickly from place to place.andP;  The benefits derived from applying ImagePlusinclude the reduction in labor dedicated to paper handling, distribution,filing, and retrieval.andP;  Improved system responsiveness is a result of shorterprocessing cycles.andP;  Other benefits are reduced storage costs and improvedavailability and control of documents.andP;  There are no lost or misfiled papers.andO;At the same time, more than one user may have access to a single document ona rapid-retrieval basis.andP;  At all times there is computerized documentcontrol.andP;  The system has greater capacity or storage density than paper,which results in cost avoidance in the long run.andM;Cited referenceandM;[1] G.
