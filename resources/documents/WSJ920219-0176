London stocks strengthened, but also in lacklusterdealings. Frankfurt equities rallied on dollar gains.   In Tokyo, stocks' skid erased the dayearlier late surge,as the positive effect of the yen's strengthening fromcentral bank's intervention couldn't be sustained.</LP><TEXT>   The Nikkei 225-stock index, which rose 441.12 pointsMonday, lost 452.95, or 2.12%, to 20872.03.   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index fell 160.54 points toclose the morning session at 20711.49.   Tuesday's first-section turnover continued to be light,leaving the market vulnerable to even small amounts ofselling. Volume was estimated at 200 million shares, down abit from 205.6 million shares a day earlier. Losersoverwhelmed gainers, 608328, while 177 issues finishedunchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of allfirst-section issues, which gained 4.52 points Monday, gaveup 19.84, or 1.27%, to 1539.99.   The Nikkei fell from a morning high of 21294.02 to a lowof 20807.40 in the afternoon, largely because of arbitrageselling. Stocks of banks and securities companies declinedsharply, while some high-priced issues with strong earningsoutlooks attracted what little buying there was.   Volatility increased because of speculative trading linkedto futures and options by Japanese banks and trust banks,which are desperate to reduce their stock-trading losses byarbitrage and options trading ahead of March 31 fiscal-yearbook closing. Volume was effectively overstated, as itincluded cross-trading, which is neutral to stock prices andoften increases at this time of year as institutionalinvestors transfer stocks between accounts to improveperformance for fiscal year-end accounts. Stocks also werehurt by Japan's gloomy economic outlook, followingdisappointing government reports on inventory levels, Tokyodepartment store sales and industrial machinery orders.   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex rose 14.9 points to 2555.9, only slightly off theintraday high of 2557.1. The FT 30-stock index advanced 13.1points to 1983.7. Volume was 559.3 million shares, comparedwith 465.5 million shares a day earlier.   Given a lack of a clear near-term direction for equities,London market makers adjusted prices higher in hopes ofattracting more institutional support to the market after theday-earlier 27-point rise. Rumors of a large potentialtakeover bid sparked some buying, and stock prices also gotsome support from anticipation of an interest-rate reductionahead of the fiscal 1993 budget the government is to issueMarch 10. Wall Street's modest rise early Tuesday didn't havea discernible effect on the London bourse, and analystsquestioned its recent strength, driven mainly by technicalfactors.   In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index climbed 13.92 pointsto 1694.99. All but one of the DAX issues advanced and thebroad market scored gains, buoyed by gains in blue chips withearnings and sales that are dollar sensitive. Still, thebourse once again couldn't generate enough momentum to piercethe 1700 resistance level on the DAX. The dollar's influenceon stocks was dismissed in some quarters, where the day'sgains were viewed as technical in nature involvingexpirations of contracts on the futures and options marketand buying by German funds.   Elsewhere in Europe, a late rally in Paris pushed equitiesbroadly higher, despite some brief profit-taking. InAmsterdam, stocks' gains resulted largely from the sharplyfirmer dollar. In Milan, share prices fell across the boardas investors followed through on the sell-off that began lateMonday.   Across Asia and the Pacific, big bourses had a mixedperformance overall. Sydney shares rose on buying by U.S. andBritish investors. Hong Kong stocks staged a technical bounceback from Monday's slump, as investors focused onconglomerates and banks, which are forecast to post robustearnings for 1991. Singapore equities' rally was encouragedby sharp rises in Malaysian shares traded over the counterand rumors of a base lending-rate cut in Malaysia. But inTaipei, stocks ended widely and sharply lower, amid growingpessimism about record high margin-trading loans, politicalunrest, and the Taiwan central bank's vow to keep the moneysupply's rapid growth control.   Among corporate developments, in Tokyo, TDK fell 60 yen,or 1.4%, to 4,290 yen ($33.57). The magnetic tapes maker'sgroup pretax profit for its third quarter ended Dec. 31dropped 23% to 14.01 billion yen ($109.6 million) from a yearearlier. TDK cited sluggish sales, especially in the marketfor computer and television parts, and slowing consumerdemand in Japan and abroad. A spokeswoman said TDK, which hadpredicted in November an 11% decline in pretax profit to 40billion yen for the fiscal year, now expects a 20% drop,though a revision won't be announced before results areposted in May.

Thebeer brewer, Japan's largest, reported a 1.8% gain in 1991unconsolidated pretax profit to 86.42 billion yen, despite a3% drop in sales to 1.316 trillion yen. For this year, Kirinexpects pretax profit to edge up to 87 billion yen.   In London, Royal Insurance Holdings added 2 pence to 232pence ($4.12). The company unveiled, as expected, a new jointholding company with Aachener andamp; MunchenerBeteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft of Germany and Fondiaria ofItaly to pursue European business outside the three insurers'home markets. The new Luxembourg holding company, to be namedEPIC European Partners for Insurance Cooperation, will buyRoyal's Dutch holding company, the principal arm of which isRoyal Nederland, for #205 million ($363.9 million). Alsobeing transferred to EPIC will be Royal's Dutchlife-insurance company, Royal Leven, which Royal Nederlandwill buy for #20 million.
