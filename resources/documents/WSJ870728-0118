Hall taught, I would like to comment on his July 6 editorial-page article on Japan's insularity. He is right that Japan's universities are not as open as their American counterparts. He was a good teacher, well-liked by students, and I wanted to see him stay on but to no avail. If Rep. Gephardt can open the door for him, so be it. But his personal predicament has nothing to do with his case against Japan.    Mr. Hall alleges that there is a well-entrenched &quot;mutual understanding industry&quot; made up of Japanese and American experts who are &quot;fending off critical analyses,&quot; &quot;glossing over sensitive issues&quot; and coddling Japan. The &quot;industry,&quot; however, comprises the whole establishments in both countries, and it is this industry that spews out such banalities as &quot;productive partnership,&quot; &quot;military alliance,&quot; &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;mutual understanding.&quot;    I, too, was very frustrated by the industry, and felt it had to go before the two countries could have a real dialogue. But I know better now. These banalities are a cover to conceal the unpleasant reality of the bilateral relationship -- the U.S. insists on keeping Japan non-nuclear. Thus the U.S. must protect and indeed coddle Japan. What looks at first like banalities turns out to be wisdom and lubricant with which the two nations manage their day-to-day relations in reasonable smoothness. Japan, for instance, makes its disarmament look like a voluntary act by keeping the no-war constitution.    Today, the Japanese are paranoid because when the gloves came off the American hands in the recent trade sanction, they came face to face with the reality of power beneath the facade. America's frustration stems precisely from its own selfimposed injunction to coddle Japan. But Mr. Hall needs the facade of banalities no less than the establishments: He told me more than once that he adamantly is opposed to a constitutional revision and nuclear armament in Japan.
