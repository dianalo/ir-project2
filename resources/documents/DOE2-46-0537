The PURPA assures selling the excessivepower to utilities and the private sector encouraged to invest in alternativeand conservative power sources by the establishment of tax credits.

More than 3000 power companies have established quidelines tointerconnect the system with distributed power sources. The Ministryof International Trade and Industry of Japan has published guidelinesfor technical requirements for system interconnection in 1986 and a temporaryagreement was reached in 1987 on the release of special power supplies.However, the reversed flow to general power distribution lines is notallowed and the excessive power is not sold as freely as in U.S. Thisproblem was studied during the a 6-year plan which started in 1980.
