 Only Insignia Solutions Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., and OrangeMicro Inc. address this shortcoming.andP;  Insignia's SoftPC with the EGA/ATOption (see MacWEEK, May 22, 1990) is an all-software Intel 80286 emulatorthat sacrifices Macintosh resources and performance.andM;Orange Micro's Orange386/16sx, meanwhile, is a single-slot NuBus board with areal Intel 80386SX processor that incorporates most, but not all, of thebasic hardware of a '386-based IBM PC compatible.andP;  The Orange386 makes noexcessive demands on Macintosh resources (using its own RAM and processor)and offers a level of performance comparable to the midlevel clones it isdesigned to emulate.andM;Good processor performance is perhaps the most notable feature of theOrange386, and applications do in fact run as they would on a clone.andO;Standard benchmark tests indicate the Orange386 performs at roughly 12 timesthe speed of the original IBM PC XT.andP;  This is at least eight times fasterthan results from the same tests of SoftPC EGA/AT on a Macintosh II.andM;The Orange386 emulates Drive C (the standard DOS system drive) with a717-Kbyte file that contains only the DOS files necessary to operate.andP;  Thisfile grows dynamically as you need additional disk space.andP;  If space has beenfreed by deleting files, Orange386 will optionally reduce the size of Drive Cwhen you quit.andP;  This method is superior to the fixed file sizes used bySoftPC EGA/AT.andM;Since the Orange386 is a true coprocessor board, it works in the backgroundwith no noticeable performance penalty to either its own applications or theMac's overall performance.andM;As shipped, the Orange386 has 1 Mbyte of RAM, expandable via parity-checkingSIMMs (single in-line memory modules) to 2, 4, 8 or 16 Mbytes.andP;  The boarduses one of the Mac's serial ports to emulate a parallel port and emulates aCGA monitor in a window on the Mac.andP;  A socket is provided for an optionalmath-coprocessor chip.andM;Orange386 uses the Mac's printer, which appears to DOS and Windowsapplications as a parallel device.andP;  This is convenient, but backgroundprinting under MultiFinder is not supported.andM;Two slots for half- or three-quarter-size interface cards are provided: oneeight-bit and one 16-bit.andP;  Although installing either category of cardinvolves some space sacrifices, this feature has a clear advantage oversoftware emulation of DOS.andM;Additional devices can be connected with the optional Orange Peripheral Kit,which provides a parallel port, a serial port, and interfaces for both a3.5-inch and a 5.25-inch PC floppy disk drive.andM;For those who find the outdated CGA video support unacceptable, twoadditional video configurations are available, although at the expense of notrunning Orange386 in a Mac window.andP;  In PC Video Card mode, you install astandard PC video interface card in one of the Orange386's slots and attach aseparate monitor.andP;  In this configuration, the Orange386 and the Mac run ontheir own screens.andM;In MultiSync mode, you install a VGA interface card on the Orange386 andattach a VGA monitor with the Video Switch Box included in the OrangePeripheral Kit.andP;  This lets both the Macintosh and the Orange386 share the VGAmonitor; you switch between the two with a menu command.andM;While these three video options appear to offer flexibility, copy and pasteare supported only in the CGA mode.andP;  Both VGA modes support only pasting.andM;Drives and the outside world.andP;  Other than the emulated Drive C, Orange386 canaccess files directly from 3.5-inch DOS disks in the Mac's SuperDrive.andP;  Italso can use a 5.25-inch PC floppy disk drive, such as the Apple PC 5.25Drive, if the Peripheral Kit is installed.andP;  The 16-bit slot on the Orange386does not support hard disk controller cards.andM;Your Mac must include a standard Apple SuperDrive or a third-party floppydrive if you hope to access PC files from other machines or back up Drive Cwithout excessive effort.andP;  In this respect, SoftPC's method of designating aMac folder for access by the PC is superior.andM;Installation.andP;  The Orange386 NuBus board can be installed in minutes.andP;  Thesoftware consists of the Orange386 application and the Drive C file.andP;  Thedegree of difficulty you may experience installing the Orange Peripheral Kitdepends on which options you use.andM;The peripheral cable plugs into the back of the Orange386 card and providescable connections for a DB-9 serial connector, a female 25-pin parallelconnector (which Orange Micro claims supports hardware copy-protectiondevices), a 37-pin PC floppy drive connector, and an eight-pin video-switchpower connector.andP;  The video-switch power connector must be connected to avideo display card installed on the Orange386.andM;To install expansion cards on the Orange386, you will have to remove theMac's cover support and a few expansion card guides, and depending on whichMac II model you're using, you may have to remove the Mac's speaker housingand replace it with a Velcro fastener.andM;Documentation and support.andP;  What passes for documentation is littered withtypos and has no index, besides being poorly produced.andP;  It's also rife withfactual errors.andP;  When we opened the MS-DOS 4.01 package, we were disappointedto discover that the software is supplied on 5.25-inch disks.andP;  DOShackers andpowers users may be able to do without more help, but for the price weexpected better.andM;Technical support is available via a toll call during normal West Coastbusiness hours, except between noon and 1 p.m.andM;Conclusions.andP;  The Orange386 offers good performance, particularly whencompared with SoftPC EGA/AT.andP;  But several aspects of the Orange386 leave usdoubting that this PC-in-a-Mac approach is worth the effort.andP;  First, at$2,498, the Orange386 is more expensive than most 16-MHz '386SX clones.andP;  Itsinability to access Macintosh files directly and limited expandabilityfurther reduce its functionality.andP;  Besides the advantage of freeing up deskspace, the Orange386 offers only limited copy-and-paste capabilities betweenMacintosh and PC applications as its primary advantage.andM;Most managers, particularly those requiring VGA graphics or better, will bebetter off buying a cheaper, faster, more expandable PC clone and connectingit to the Mac over a network or transferring files by floppy.andM;Nevertheless, users who simply must run software from the DOS world on theMac (those who are mobile and need to move around with both a Mac II and PC,for example) will appreciate the Orange386's performance.andP;  But until OrangeMicro adjusts the price of the Orange386 to a more realistic level andprovides acceptable documentation, we doubt if many Mac managers will judgeit to be a reasonable solution.andM;Orange Micro Inc. is at 1400 N. Lakeview Ave., Anaheim, Calif.andP;  92807.andP;  Phone(714) 779-2772; fax (714) 779-9332.andM;Orange386andM;Orange Micro Inc.andM;The Orange386/16sx gives the Mac the ability to run DOS and Windows 3.0applications (either in CGA mode within a Mac window or via an optionalexternal monitor) at an acceptable level of performance.andP;  Compared withsoftware-emulation methods, it offers better speed and the capability to addtwo IBM PC interface cards.andP;  Its inability to access Mac files directly, poordocumentation and non-competitive price, however, make it a poor choice forall but a few applications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
