Grace andamp; Co. was indicted by a federal grand jury for making false statements to the Environmental Protection Agency during a 1982 investigation by that agency.    According to the indictment, the EPA -- in seeking the cause of industrial contamination of two municipal wells in Woburn, Mass. -- had asked Grace's Cryovac division in Woburn about chemical use and waste handling at the plant.    The indictment charges that Grace understated the amounts and types of solvents used and that the company &quot;concealed from the EPA&quot; that solvents and other wastes frequently were poured into the ground behind the plant.    The two felony counts are each punishable by a $10,000 fine, the Justice Department said.    In New York, Grace called the indictment &quot;unjust and without merit.&quot;    &quot;Grace flatly denies the charges,&quot; the chemical concern said. It added that &quot;neither the company, nor any past or present employee of the company has engaged in criminal conduct.&quot;    Furthermore, Grace claimed that it had cooperated fully with the EPA to provide &quot;all relevant information concerning waste disposal at the Cryovac plant in Woburn.&quot;    The company said, &quot;The U.S. Attorney's office appears to be experimenting with novel legal theories suggesting, unfairly, that a corporation can be guilty of criminal intent even though no individual had any criminal intent.&quot;    As previously reported, Grace settled with 14 Woburn families who claimed that the company polluted municipal wells, causing six leukemia deaths and numerous illnesses since 1978. Eight of the families had sued Grace in federal court. The other six had filed, or were planning to file suits in state court.    Grace denied polluting the wells or being responsible for the deaths or illnesses. The company makes food-packaging machinery at its Woburn plant. </TEXT></DOC>
