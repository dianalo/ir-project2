Gorbachev came close toagreeing to in ``raise-you-one'' negotiations in Iceland is on thetable again in Moscow _ still enticing and still elusive.   But U.S. officials do not expect Reagan to engage this time inimpromptu, derring-do, head-to-head negotiating with Gorbachev ofthe sort they partook in at Reykjavik in October 1986.   The United States and the Soviet Union have been negotiating,off and on, since 1982 on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, knownas START. The United States proposed a 30 percent cut in bothnations' stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons. The Soviet Unioncountered by proposing 50 percent.   It looked for a moment like Gorbachev and Reagan might have adeal _ or at least agreement at the top on the framework for a deal_ when they met in Iceland.   But Reagan's dream of a space-based missile defense system _Star Wars _ proved too great a stumbling block.   Gorbachev wanted testing limited to the laboratory. Reaganwanted real world testing. They could not agree and parted indisappointment. START went back to Geneva, where both sides havebeen negotiating.   Now it appears too late for a START agreement. Soviet officialssay more than 1,200 points of disagreement exist.   The issue is awesomely complex, especially the question ofverification. Strategic weapons can be delivered by bombers ormissiles.   Missiles can be fired from land, planes, ships or submarines.Land-fired missiles can be launched from fixed sites, or movablesites _ mobile missiles systems of which the Soviets have two andthe United States have none.   The two sides are unable to find acceptable ways to verifycutbacks in such easily hidden systems.   Another issue is whether a START agreement would ban existing orfuture intercontinental ballistic missile systems.   On top of that, Reagan's Star Wars program remains a seeminglyinsurmountable obstacle. The Soviets want to restrict tests inspace, and will not agree to cuts in offensive weapons unless theycan call the reductions off if they conclude Star Wars violates the1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   ``It's now clear there is no way these questions can be shapedup in treaty form in time for the summit,'' Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz said May 12 in Geneva, Switzerland after windingup pre-summit talks with his Soviet counterpart, Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze.   That being the case, U.S. officials do no expect Reagan to tryto bridge the gap in face-to-face talks with Gorbachev.   At their first summit in Geneva in 1985, the two leaders spenttime alone, in front of a roaring fireplace, and then walkingoutside in the snappy Swiss fall air.   The informality of the arrangement, with only their interpreterspresent, helped break the ice.   As they strolled back from a conversation in a garden gazebo,Gorbachev accepted Reagan's proposal for annual summit meetings.Apparently, that was the only time in their three summit meetingsthat one-on-one sessions produced a substantive result.   At their second summit, in Reykjavik, Reagan was alone withGorbachev for about 25 minutes, mostly discussing human rights.When they turned to the detailed issue of arms control _ andswapped proposals that escalated until it seemed there would be abreakthrough in the arms race _ Reagan had Shultz at his side.   Reykjavik did set the stage for the treaty signed by Reagan andGorbachev last December in Washington to eliminate all U.S. andSoviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.   In Washington, Reagan and Gorbachev were alone for about ahalf-hour. Again, the subject was human rights.   In Moscow, apart from the opening night dinner, Reagan's programcalls for two private sessions with Gorbachev.   The first will be in the Kremlin, shortly after the presidentarrives from Helsinki, Finland. A Gorbachev greeting is all that isanticipated. On Reagan's third day in Moscow they will be aloneagain.   Even without a START breakthrough, there is much on the armscontrol agenda for them to discuss.   They may sign an agreement under which each side would notifythe other before testing a land-based or submarine-based missile,giving the place of launch and intended target.   They may sign protocols calling for experiments to establishmore thorough means of verifying two treaties that have been agreedupon but never verified by the Senate _ although experts believeboth sides are adhering to them.   These are the Threshhold Test Ban Treaty signed on July 3, 1974and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty signed May 28, 1976,banning nuclear tests greater than 150 kilotons (more than 100times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb in World War II).   Gorbachev, in a grand gesture, may announce the unilateralwithdrawal of 50,000 to 100,000 forward-based Soviet troops inEurope in an effort to spur agreement on a reduction of both sides'conventional forces in Europe.   Western experts say the Soviet bloc has a 2-1 advantage over theWest in conventional forces. The Mutual and Balanced ForceReduction Talks went on for 14 years without producing agreement.   Finally, the superpowers may agree on ways to bring about aworldwide ban on chemical weapons. Forty nations are negotiating atthe United Nations Committee on Disarmament on a ban, but the talksare stalled over the intrusive verification measures that would berequired to assure compliance. These weapons can be manufactured inordinary chemical factories without attracting attention.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sun May 29</NOTE></DOC>
