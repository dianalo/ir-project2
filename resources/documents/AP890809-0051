Don Wactor in Orange, N.J.,where police and residents held a rally Tuesday in front of abuilding plagued by drug dealers.   People from two communities in Minnesota formed a human chainacross a bridge to symbolize two neighborhoods uniting to fightcrime.   ``Most people want to be neighborly, but they need some excuse,some catalyst,'' said Matt Peskin, coordinator of the program forthe National Association of Town Watch Inc. ``It gives themsomething to do besides sitting on their porch.''   Peskin, who lives outside Philadelphia in Wynnewood, said moreorganized events were held this year than last. By night's end, heexpected 20.5 million Americans in more than 7,600 communities toparticipate, an increase of more than 2 million over last year'sestimate.   Sponsors arranged to have the U.S. Air Force's DefenseMeteorological Satellite photograph the country to show the glow ofporch lights.   The Strategic Air Command plans to give sponsors a compositepicture of the event created by one pass of the satellite over theeastern United States at 9:30 p.m. and a photograph of the westernhalf a few hours later.   Police officers said they hoped the evening would involveresidents in crime prevention by getting them to know theirneighbors and to report crime when they see it.   ``People can be our eyes and ears in the community, and theyneed to be,'' Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Glenn Cannon said.``Nobody has to tolerate illegal drugs in their community and noone has to tolerate violent crime.''   FBI Director Williams Sessions turned on a giant light bulb inWashington, D.C., to kick off the event, which he called a ``symbolof solidarity and determination.''   In Rochester, N.Y., a ``dunk-the-criminal booth'' allowedresidents to take out their frustrations on a man dressed as acriminal.   In Cincinnati, residents met in the streets to discuss crime.   ``Most of streets have cul-de-sacs which make good meetingplaces. Everybody brings a lawn chair and soft drinks,'' said EvieLandigran, who organized the effort for the neighborhood of PaddockHills.   Neighborhood watch groups in Hartford and other Connecticutcities celebrated with block parties and barbecues that featuredpolice officers as guests of honor.   In the New York City, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrerheld a candlelight march with residents active in local anti-drugcampaigns. In a seedy thoroughfare in lower Manhattan, residentsheld a karate demonstration and an after-dark dance contestfeaturing the latest rap sounds.   Residents in Kansas City walked through their neighborhoods withcandles and flashlights. ``I want to do anything that can drivedrugs out of our communities,'' said Florence Purvey.   National Night Out, created by Peskin, presents an award eachyear to the city that saw the largest decrease in crime. Last year,Houston won the cup when major crime decreased 48 percent on thenight of the event.</TEXT></DOC>
