GAYE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANJUL, Gambia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Liberia's three warring factions agreedFriday to hold a conference inside that country within 60 days tochoose a caretaker government.   The ``all-Liberia'' conference was announced in a statement atthe end of two days of talks in Banjul, Gambia. The talks in thisWest African country were intended to allow the combatants tonegotiate an end to the yearlong civil war, which has left morethan 12,000 civilians dead.   The rival parties apparently were unable to agree on anythingexcept the conference at the Gambian talks, which were mediated bythe Economic Community of West African States. It was not clear howthe meeting was affected by the absence of rebel leader CharlesTaylor, who sent only a representative.   The agreement to choose a new interim government put in questionthe role of a temporary administration already installed inMonrovia, the Liberian capital, under the sponsorship of the WestAfrican community. Taylor had refused to join the government led byAmos Sawyer, calling it a puppet of Liberia's West Africanneighbors. The two other warring factions both have seats inSawyer's administration.   A major aim of the Banjul meeting was to negotiate how a WestAfrican intervention force already in Monrovia would police acease-fire agreed Nov. 28.   Friday's statement said another meeting would be held within 30days to discuss monitoring the cease-fire. In the meantime, thethree armies said they would remain in positions they held when thefighting stopped.   The participants also were to discuss disarming the warringsides. Friday's communique said the interim government to be chosenat the ``all-Liberia'' conference would organize the disarmament.   Signatories to Friday's agreement are the National PatrioticFront of Taylor, breakaway rebel leader Prince Johnson and remnantsof slain President Samuel Doe's army led by Brig. Hezekiah Bowen.   Taylor's men are spread throughout Liberia outside of Monrovia.The West African soldiers have confined Johnson's and Bowen's mento separate barracks around the capital.   Taylor started the war with a Christmas Eve invasion from IvoryCoast to oust Doe, who was accused of corruption and repression.Doe was captured and killed earlier this year.</TEXT></DOC>
