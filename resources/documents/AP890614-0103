Britain and its colony Hong Kong, the destination of most ``boatpeople'' go, pressed for an agreement that all who cannot prove theyare threatened with political persecution be returned to Vietnam.   An increase in the rate of illegal emigration from Vietnam haspushed the total population of Southeast Asian refugee camps tonearly 90,000, almost three times the total in 1986. Most newarrivals flee their homeland because of economic hardship.   Vietnam and the United States, joined Wednesday by the SovietUnion, have opposed mandatory repatriation. Foreign Minister NguyenCo Thach of Vietnam reiterated at a news conference that his countrywill not accept anyone returned against his will.   Hong Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson, governor of Hong Kong,told the delegates forced repatriation of all but political refugeeswas a ``humane course'' to deal with the action.   Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, said the 43,000boat people now in Hong Kong had caused a ``major humanitariancrisis'' in the colony, which already is among the most denselypopulated places in the world.   A ``Comprehensive Plan of Action,'' adopted by consensus at theend of the two-day conference, provides for screening new arrivalsto determine whether they are political refugees. Hong Kong has beenscreening since June 1988 and several other nations began in March.   The plan recommends efforts to encourage the voluntary return ofthose who are refused political refugee status. Only 143 have agreedto repatriation so far, despite formal assurances by Vietnam thatthere will be no reprisals.   If voluntary repatriation does not make ``sufficient progress ... in reasonable time, alternatives recognized as being acceptableunder international practice would be examined,'' says the six-pageplan.   It relies on an ``international media campaign'' to publicizedangers and disadvantages facing boat people, including attacks bypirates, and the benefits of legal emigration programs.   An appeal in the plan for expanded refugee resettlement programsdrew immediate responses from several countries, which pledged togive new homes in the next three years to at least 53,500 of the55,000 ``long-staying'' refugees _ those who arrived beforescreening began.   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said the UnitedStates would take 22,000 and also anticipated accepting ``up to 50percent'' of later arrivals classes as political refugees.   The United States has received 900,000 of the 1.5 million peoplewho have fled Vietnam since the war ended in April 1975. Eagleburgersaid it also has contributed more than $500 million to the supportof refugees and spent billions on resettlement costs.   In response, Thach said at his news conference: ``We have to lookback at the origin of the refugee problem ... 40 years of warfareagainst Vietnam. The U.S. delegation tells us that half a billiondollars were spent to support the refugees. But more than $300billion were spent to kill Vietnamese.''   A statement from the U.S. delegation Wednesday said Vietnam hadagreed to resume talks on letting Vietnamese detained inre-education camps move to the United States.   One session was held in Hanoi in July 1988, but Vietnam suspendednegotiations the next month. The U.S. statement said talks wouldresume in July, with the date and place to be announced later.   Thach said Vietnam had released 94,000 inmates of re-educationcamps in the past 10 years and 120 still are detained.   All were interned for having links to the United States or theformer South Vietnamese regime.   More than 10,000 former inmates have applied to emigrate to theUnited States with their families _ a total of 50,000 people, a U.S.official said on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
