Its high-tech members are moving rapidly into a world in which computers design computers made by robots controlled by still other computers, all to serve customers who will place orders -- by computer. (If one of these new machines has a bug, it can call yet another computer for help.)    But the industry that makes computers still rates only a B+ in how it uses them. Consultants say the industry must be graded by a tougher standard -- it did invent the machines, after all. And computer firms stumble over the same snafus that plague their customers.    Not even the biggest companies escape some of the snags: years of delay in developing in-house systems; chaos when corporate reorganizations run ahead of changes in technical-staff support; a mishmash of incompatible systems that operate differently and require duplicate upkeep and training. Some makers also are hampered by a not-invented-here syndrome that makes them reluctant to use a rival's gear, even though it may do a better job.    Computer companies have little choice but to innovate. Customers have come to expect the 20%-a-year price declines that followed the industry's earlier breakthroughs. Product lives, meanwhile, grow shorter all the time. Ten years ago, new generations of big computers took years to design and lasted five years or more; now they live out a peak life expectancy of only two or three years. So new technology -- to design, make and fix parts and products faster, more efficiently and more cheaply -- is key to survival.    &quot;It's an intensely competitive environment,&quot; says William F. Zachmann, consultant with International Data Corp. &quot;The rate of adoption of new technology is much faster in computers because the rate of change in their products is much faster. Anyone doing reasonably well almost by definition has to be pretty advanced in its own use of technology.&quot;    Digital Equipment Corp. is spending $1 billion over five years on improved customer support, including artificial-intelligence tools that enable computers to diagnose and repair problems in customers' machines.    International Business Machines Corp., the biggest vendor, is also the biggest spender. It internally consumes 10% of its product output each year; since 1982 it has doubled computer spending per employee, thereby quadrupling computing power per employee.    (Some critics say IBM doesn't know when to stop its internal computers. In the first months of the industry's recent slump, IBM's highly automated plants kept turning out machines at boom-time rates. Inventory soared, and thousands of IBMers had to move from production into sales.)    Yet computer makers do share some of their clients' problems. Both suffer from delays, now running two to three years, in software development. &quot;Even with new tools, it's taking far too long. It's one of the biggest problems facing the industry,&quot; says J. Carl Masi, International Data's chairman.    And makers constantly reorganize, fouling up internal computer networks. &quot;Their structures change so fast they can't get any consensus&quot; on unifying the systems of various units, says Thomas Davenport, consultant with Index Group. L.W. Beers, a vice president at Unisys Corp., adds, &quot;The business changes so much, so quickly, that programs aren't as amenable&quot; to revision as they need to be. Unisys, formed last year in the merger of Burroughs Corp. and Sperry Corp., still hasn't merged the disparate computer systems supporting the two former rivals.    Even when the gear works, other things can go wrong. Digital Equipment encountered trouble in 1983 after a major reorganization. Millions of dollars of orders weren't shipped because one side of the reorganized company didn't know what the other was doing.    &quot;People just assume computers can do everything,&quot; a Digital spokesman says. &quot;They can eliminate drudgery. But if you don't have the right people and the right amount of data at the right time, you've got big problems.&quot;    (See related stories: &quot;Airlines&quot;, &quot;Autos&quot;, &quot;Banking&quot;, &quot;Money Management&quot;, &quot;Petroleum&quot;, &quot;Pharmaceuticals&quot;, &quot;Publishing&quot;, &quot;Telecommunications&quot; and &quot;Behind the Report Cards&quot; -- WSJ June 12, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
