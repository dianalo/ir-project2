The group holds 12.35% of the Milwaukee-based maker of mining, aerospace and industrial products.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it believes the $14.45-a-share offering price in the buyout is &quot;materially unfair&quot; to shareholders.    According to the filing, the group intends to &quot;actively pursue the issue of fair value for the shareholders and take whatever steps are necessary to accomplish that objective.&quot; Such steps might include hiring investment bankers or encouraging a bid to all shareholders by a Gabelli affiliate, the filing said.    The filing said that a competing Gabelli bid would involve &quot;the same terms and conditions as the present offer plus a pro-rata portion of the equity, equal to 25%, in the continuing company.&quot;    Shareholders are scheduled to vote June 4 on the management-led buyout. Under terms of the proposal, shareholders would receive $10.45 in cash and $4 in debentures in exchange for each of their Becor Western common shares.    The group holds 2,037,100 Becor Western shares, including 613,900 shares purchased from April 6 to May 26 at prices ranging from $13.75 to $15.469. It also sold 14,000 shares at prices of $14.75 to $15.375 a share, the filing said.    Becor Western executives didn't return phone calls late yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
