De Klerk did not say when the prisoners would be released.   ``We are encouraged by these positive moves, and hope that theyare merely the first steps in a process which will see the releaseof all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, and thereturn of political exiles, lifting of the state of emergency andassociated restrictions on political activity, and negotiations ona peaceful transition to a nonracial and democratic South Africa,''Ms. Tutwiler said.   Ms. Tutwiler said South African Foreign Minister P.W. Bothacalled Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Tuesday to tell himof the government's decision. She was asked whether Botha had givenBaker any idea of when Nelson Mandela might be released.   ``If he did, Secretary Baker did not impart that to me,'' Ms.Tutwiler said, adding that she didn't know whether Baker plannedany further meetings with South African officials.
