U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ordered an evidentiaryhearing to be held June 28 and directed court clerks to placedetails of the defense allegation on the public record.   The court papers were to be released later in the day. But it isunderstood the defense had raised allegations of misconduct againstjuror Tara King, who told reporters after the trial that she hadonce used cocaine.   Ms. King said she did not use cocaine during the eight-week trial.   Gesell granted a motion by North's lawyers to reconsider hisearlier refusal to hold a closed hearing on the defense allegations.   Gesell rescheduled the sentencing from Friday until July 5.   Prosecutors have said North should go to prison because he brokethe law during the Iran-Contra scandal, lied about it during histrial and still doesn't show ``one iota of remorse.''   In a sentencing memo likening the fired White House aide to thecorrupt politicians of Tammany Hall, prosecutors say North ``viewedand continues to view himself as being above the law and beyondreproach.''   The former National Security Council aide faces a possible10-year term for destroying evidence, aiding and abetting theobstruction of Congress and accepting an illegal gratuity.   Letting North go without a prison term ``would be a statementthat 15 years after Watergate, government officials can participatein a brazen cover-up, lie to Congress and collect a substantialgratuity and still receive only a slap on the wrist,'' prosecutorstold Gesell in their memo Monday.   ``North's view that anything goes in a political controversywould be sustained'' by letting him off without a prison sentence,said the memo signed by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.``Instead, since his acts are a serious breach of the public trust,they warrant serious punishment.''   Walsh did not make a specific recommendation of how much timeNorth should serve in prison. North's lawyers are likely to file aresponse to the prosecutor's harsh statement.   Walsh charged that North concocted a false story to help winacquittal on a charge that he pocketed $4,300 in travelers checksentrusted to him by Adolfo Calero, a Nicaraguan Contra leader.   North's testimony that he purchased a car with $15,000 in cash heaccumulated in a box nailed to his closet floor ``echoed the flimsylies offered by corrupt municipal officials in the days of TammanyHall,'' Walsh said, in a reference to the New York political machinewhich ran the city from the mid-19th century into the 1930s andbecame synonymous with graft and fraud.   Walsh called the steel box story ``preposterous'' and said``North's perjury represents another indication of his continuingcallous attitude toward the judicial process and our democraticinstitutions.''   Throughout the 12-page memo, Walsh repeated the theme that``North has not indicated one iota of remorse for having committedcrimes which, because of his position of public trust, jeopardizedthe constitutional processes of government.''   ``He apparently sees nothing wrong with alteration anddestruction of official national security records,'' Walsh said.   ``His participation in the preparation of a false and misleadingchronology (of U.S.-Iran arms sales) has not led to anyacknowledgement of wrongdoing,'' the prosecutor added.   ``Certainly he sees nothing wrong with lying to Congress, when inthe view of himself and his superiors lying is necessary,'' Walshsaid. ``North seems to believe that such activities are business asusual in government or necessary tactics in a `politicalfirestorm.'''   North's ``contempt for Congress and the public is accompanied byvenality in financial matters,'' Walsh said of the retired Marinelieutenant colonel's acceptance of a $13,800 security system fromarms dealer Richard V. Secord, an Iran-Contra co-defendant awaitingtrial.   Walsh said a prison term is necessary to reduce North's politicalfollowing that was cultivated on the lecture circuit and``reinforces his lack of remorse.''   Walsh rejected North's contention that he is a scapegoat.   ``Few criminal defendants have attempted to blame so many othersfor so many lawless acts,'' the independent prosecutor said. ``Northmust accept his fair share of responsibility.''   Walsh also disputed North's suggestion at the trial that whateverhe did had the implicit authorization of higher Reaganadministration officials.   ``This society cannot tolerate government officials unwilling andunable to exercise independent judgment and responsibility inrefusing to perform illegal acts,'' Walsh said. The sentence shouldshow that ``one cannot simply rely on real or imagined authorizationof illegal conduct and expect to escape responsibility,'' Walsh said.</TEXT></DOC>
