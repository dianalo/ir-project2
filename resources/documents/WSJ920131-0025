Two weeks ago, a40% showing for Buchanan in the Feb. 18 primary seemedrealistic; now GOP analysts say he could be held to 25% orless. Bush strategists say Buchanan is wearing out hiswelcome with the state's GOP voters; a recent poll shows moreview him unfavorably than favorably.</LP><TEXT>   Bush's campaign, after initially emphasizing his concernover hard times in New Hampshire, now begins &quot;phase two&quot; withcommercials touting his program. Radio ads to begin thisweekend contain passages from the State of the Union itself,while new TV spots use the same themes.   Despite Bush's rising optimism, Bay Buchanan, chairman ofher brother's campaign, insists there's still plenty of timefor the tide to turn again.                                                                                                          NEW CUTS in interest rates aren't likely at next week'sFed parley.   Administration officials predict that Fed policy makersare likely to sit on the sidelines for a few weeks. Besideslast year's deep reductions, bond market jitters about taxcuts also inhibit more easing. Greenspan warns that &quot;thebargaining process&quot; may yield cuts that are &quot;far too large.&quot;   Though the Fed reviews its money-supply growth targetsnext week, it won't disclose them until Greenspan testifieson Capitol Hill Feb. 19. Some Fed officials say the newtargets should take into account how slowly the money supplygrew last year. Greenspan tells the Senate Banking Committeethat he is still worried that &quot;the money supply has beendragging,&quot; but notes signs that growth is beginning to pickup.                                                                                                          CLINTON KEEPS his campaign together, though some partypoliticos worry.   With New Hampshire polls suggesting his support holdssteady, strategist James Carville insists the fidelity flap&quot;is over.&quot; Clinton is still the only candidate with moneystored up for beyond New Hampshire. Even so, many of the 771elected officials and party leaders who are automaticconvention delegates -- comprising 18% of the convention --fear the possibility of new charges.   Non-candidates Bentsen, Gephardt and Gore take privatesoundings about their chances for a late entry. Though manypoliticians view Bentsen as best positioned, he would surelydraw fire for rejoining the all-white clubs he dropped out ofin 1988. A problem for any late entrant: Filing deadlines forthe Super Tuesday primaries, Illinois and Michigan havealready passed, and are less than three weeks off for NewYork, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.   Cuomo, who publicly trashed Clinton this week, would loveto jump in -- but still can't figure a way out of the NewYork budget mess.                                                                                                          FATTER CATS: The Democratic National Committee launches anew fund-raising program, asking bigwigs to personallycontribute or raise $200,000 for the party in 1992. So far,it has recruited 25 people, including such party stalwarts asPamela Harriman, Northwest Airlines boss Al Checchi and WallStreeter Michael Del Giudice.                                                                                                          MOSBACHER GAFFES embarrass the Bush campaign. The generalchairman raises the Clinton fidelity issue publicly, eventhough GOP strategists want it left to the press. His speechat last month's Gridiron dinner was widely derided.Meanwhile, wife Georgette -- who also has reveled inClinton's problems -- crows that she can't wait until theelection is over so she can use the Maserati and jewelsagain.                                                                                                          FRESH BLOOD: The ranks of regional Fed bank presidentscontinue to churn. The senior president, Robert Black ofRichmond, is set to retire this year. Meanwhile, the searchfor a new Cleveland president continues, and two other spotshave turned over in the past year.                                                                                                          THE GOVERNMENT GRAPPLES with bank mergers. Justice,fearing market concentration, negotiates with Bank of Americaover its plan to merge with Security Pacific; the Fed takes asofter line. Congressional limits to prevent bank dominationof markets could be added to any bill to allow interstatebranching.                                                                                                          THE U.S. SEEKS curbs on China's sprawling arms-salebusiness.   During Bush's U.N. meeting today with Premier Li Peng,officials hope for a written promise that China will honorthe international accord against selling missile-relatedtechnology. Baker got a verbal assurance during his trip toChina last year, but U.S. officials want it in writingbecause of their lack of trust in Beijing.   Even if Li Peng signs on, it's far from clear he can keephis promise. &quot;He may not really know who's selling what,&quot;says one U.S. official. The reason: Arms sales provide asteady stream of hard currency to relatives of China's rulingofficials, and manufacturers seem to have no overall control.   China's F-7M Airguard fighter sells briskly in southeastAsia and the Mideast.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Pay as you go: Bush's budget proposescharging convicted criminals a fee equal to the cost of theirfirst year in prison. . . . A New York retailer going out ofbusiness advertises, &quot;A year ago we were in Operation DesertStorm. Now it's Operation Desert Store.&quot; . . .
