Currency analysts say it is still aided by the belief thatthe U.S. economy is picking up after the Persian Gulf war andwill require little further credit relaxation by the FederalReserve to get back to full force.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The tone in the market is still pretty positive,&quot; saysKevin Weir, a trader at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce inNew York.   That positive tone was very evident Friday. After tumblingon news about unexpectedly weak U.S. employment data forMarch, the dollar hit technical support at lower levels andrebounded with a vengeance. In late New York trading, thedollar was quoted at 1.6855 marks and 136.65 yen, up from1.6690 marks and 136.04 yen late Thursday.   Traders say heavy speculative buying around 1.6538 marks,the day's low, helped the dollar survive news that theunemployment rate jumped to 6.8% in March from 6.5% inFebruary. The March number is the highest level since 6.9% inNovember 1986; a 6.7% jobless rate had been expected byeconomists. Still, the worrisome data triggered surprisinglylittle dollar selling.   In Tokyo early Monday, the dollar was trading at 136.55yen, up slightly from Friday's Tokyo close of 136.30 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6895 marks, upfrom Friday's Tokyo close of 1.6683 marks.   &quot;The positive sentiment regarding the dollar and theeconomy is undiminished&quot; despite the latest employmentreport, says Earl Johnson, a foreign exchange adviser atHarris Trust andamp; Savings Bank in Chicago. Indeed, he says,traders regard dollar pullbacks as a &quot;great opportunity tobuy cheap dollars&quot; because of perceptions that the economy isrecovering.   Optimism about the economy isn't groundless. Althoughemployment data have been quite weak for some time, glimmersof strength were evident in some recent economic statistics.The index of leading economic indicators rose an unexpectedlylarge 1.1% in February -- climbing strongly after sixconsecutive declines and registering the largest monthlyincrease in nearly three years. Housing starts rose 16.4% inFebruary after falling 12.5% in January and 14.1% inDecember.   Some currency specialists, though, are skeptical about thepotential for further dollar gains. &quot;Shorter term, I thinkthe dollar is suspect,&quot; says Diego Giurleo, senior manager oftreasury services at Royal Bank of Canada in New York. He andsome other currency watchers say the dollar may have troublegetting beyond resistance around 1.70 marks because ofpersistent evidence of U.S. economic weakness.   Moreover, analysts say much of the concern about politicaland economic uncertainty in Germany and the Soviet Union hasbeen factored into the dollar's current level against themark. That means the dollar may not get much of a boost fromany further turmoil there.   Since hitting a post-World War II low of 1.4425 marks onFeb. 11, the dollar has risen nearly 20% against the Germancurrency. The dollar hit a one-year high of 1.7220 marks onMarch 28, but profit-taking dragged it down from that level.   Still, with optimism about the U.S. economy underpinningthe dollar, traders say there probably won't be massivedollar selling if, as anticipated, the Federal Reserve easesin the near future.   Although wrangling among Fed officials is believed to beslowing the decision-making process in Washington, economistssay the Fed may soon lower its 6% discount rate on loans tomember banks and allow the Federal Funds rate, which is thecharge on overnight loans among commercial banks, to fallbelow the current perceived target of 6%.   Some economists say the Fed may wait until inflation datafor March are released before easing.   The producer price index for March, scheduled for releaseThursday, is expected by economists to be down 0.1% afterdropping 0.6% in February. But the consumer price index, tobe reported Friday, is expected to have risen 0.1% last monthafter increasing 0.2% in February.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $359.80 an ounce, up 30 cents. Estimatedvolume was 2.6 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $359.15 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
