This concept of coated steel with CPhas been used by offshore oil producers to achieve weight and cost savingson offshore structures. For structures in deep water, the weight savingsare significant. Also, in areas in which CP design requirements are notwell established, the coating/CP system offers special advantages. Conoco'sexperience with coating/CP systems in the Gulf of Mexico and the NorthSea is presented along with planned future use of this corrosion controlsystem.</TEXT></DOC>
