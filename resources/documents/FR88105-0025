Auburn University. 2. Public Citizen and Freedom of Information Clearing House. 3. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. 4. Hunton and Williams, counsel for Utility Air Regulatory Group. 5. National Wildlife Federation. Comments are addressed in the analysis that follows. In addition to changesbrought about by comments received, several minor changes have been madepursuant to internal agency review. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section 2.100 Definitions: (b) ``EPA Record'' </ITAG>One commenter objected to the amendment of the definition of ``EPA Record''which provides that a record must be in EPA's ``possession or control''in order to be considered an ``EPA Record.'' The commenter disagreed thatcase law warrants changing the existing language which provides that arecord that ``is, was, or is alleged to be possessed by EPA'' is an EPArecord. The existing language inaccurately implies that records that areno longer in EPA's possession, or perhaps never were but are merely allegedto be in EPA's possession, are nonetheless EPA records. In order to correctthis inaccuracy, a change to this definition is necessary. This commentor also suggested that ``records that are generated at agencyexpense, or that are used for any form in the conduct of agency business,without regard to ownership, are agency records'' and that EPA's finalrules should so acknowledge. Because the precise language used in caselaw to describe ``agency records'' varies depending on the type of recordreferred to, EPA has used the terms ``possession or control'' to characterizethe general approach taken by the courts. See <T3>Kissinger v. Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the Press, </T3>445U.S. 139 (1980). See also <T3>Forsham v. Harris, </T3>445 U.S. 169 (1980); <T3>Wolfe v. HHS, </T3>771 F.2d 1077 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <T3>Goland v. CIA, </T3>607 F.2d 339 (D.C. Cir. 1978). The commentor objected further to the language that exempts ``materialswhich are legally owned by an EPA officer or employee in his or her purelypersonal capacity'' from being ``agency records''. See <T3>Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>United States Department of Justice, </T3>742 F.2d 1484 (D.C. Cir.1984). <ITAG tagnum="85">Section 2.100(e) `` `Commercial Use' Request,'' ``Educational Institution''and ``Representatives of the News Media'' </ITAG>Two commenters objected to the definitions of ``commercial use request''and ``educational institution''; three objected to ``representatives ofthe news media''. These definitions, which categorize requesters for the purpose of establishingfees to be charged, were taken directly from the OMB Fee Guidance whichwas published subject to notice and comment. See OMB Guidelines, 52 FR10012 (March 27, 1987). EPA not only believes that the Freedom of InformationReform Act of 1986 mandates that EPA adopt the guidance established byOMB, but also that OMB's definitions correctly implement the statutoryterms as set forth in the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section 2.100(j) ``Review'' </ITAG>A parenthetical note was added to this definition to explain that reviewof documents must be done for all responses to FOIA requests, but thatreview time may only be charged to commercial use requesters. <ITAG tagnum="85">Section 2.113(d)(2) Circumstances Under Which an Initial DeterminationShall Not Reveal the Existence or Non-existence of Records </ITAG>Four commentors expressed concern over the language contained in the revisionto this section. Some believed this to be the implementation of the provisionof subsection (c) of the Act. This section was amended only to clarify the language in the existing regulationrelating to so-called ``glomar'' responses, first articulated in <T3>Phillippi</T3> v. <T3>CIA,</T3> 546 F.2d 1009, and not to implement any provisions in theReform Act. Apparently, this attempt to clarify was not successful. Accordingly,EPA will retain the existing language, with two exceptions: (1) ``Confidentialinvestigation'' will no longer be included in this section and (2) ``classifiednational security information'' will be added. The Agency does not believethat ``glomar'' responses are appropriate for records exempt under exemption(7)(A) ``confidential investigation'' (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(A)). Under limitedcircumstances, a ``glomar'' response is appropriate in cases involving``classified national security information'', withholdable under exemption1 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)). <ITAG tagnum="84">Section 2.116 Contents of Determination Denying Appeal </ITAG>This section was changed only to conform to the change in andSection; 2.113(d)(2).Likewise, EPA will retain the existing language of this section with theabove-noted exceptions, making this section consistent with andSection; 2.113(d)(2).<ITAG tagnum="84">Section 2.120 Fees, Payment, Waiver </ITAG>Some of the subsections of this section have been renumbered for organizationalpurposes. All substantive changes are noted below. Section 2.120(a)(1)(i) and (iv) (previously andSection; 2.120(a)(4)) Chargesfor Search and Review When No Records are Located or Released One commentor objected to the provision by which the Agency may assesssearch and review charges even though no records are found or the recordsare determined to be exempt from disclosure. This provision is adoptedfrom the OMB Guidelines, with which the Agency is bound to comply. Sincethe Agency will incur the cost of search and review regardless of whetherrecords are found and/or released, it is appropriate that a requestor whohas not requested or has not been granted a fee waiver be held liable forsuch cost rather than the Agency and, ultimately, the taxpayer. The finalrule differs from the proposal, but only to clarify that only two categoriesof requests may be subject to these charges: ``Commercial use requests'',with regard to both search and review costs; and the ``all other requests''category, with regard to search costs (but not cost of review time). Section 2.120(a)(5)(iv) No Charges for the First Two Hours of Search TimeOne commentor raised a question concerning calculations of the cost ofcomputer search time in regard to the waiver of the first two hours ofsearch time. In response to this query, the Agency has added the language``or its cost equivalent'' to this section, indicating that when a computersearch is undertaken, the two hours not chargeable will be calculated asthe dollar equivalent of a two hour manual search, in keeping with theOMB Guidelines on this point. See OMB Fee Guideline section 7.f, 52 FR10012, 10019 (March 27, 1987). The statute makes no distinction concerningcomputer search time and the ``two free hours.'' Because few computer searcheswould reach two hours and because the cost of computer search time is fargreater per unit of time than the cost of manual search, it is unreasonableto conclude that Congress intended the ``two free hours'' to extend literallyto computer search time. It is far more reasonable to extend the two hourcost equivalent of a manual search. Section 2.120(c)(1) Assurance of Payment of Fees One commentor expressed concern that to require a requestor to agree topay all fees (over $25.00) before the time deadline begins to run is notin accordance with law. This subsection was changed to eliminate referenceto ``prepayment'', in accordance with the amended statute. This subsectionwas not otherwise substantively changed, rather its language was simplified.The time-tolling section, (andSection; 2.112(d)) to which this subsectionpreviously cross referenced, has not been changed. The time-tolling FOIAfee provisions, which are based upon sound principles of responsible costrecovery and are aimed at providing the government with some assuranceof reimbursement before it expends the cost and effort to process a request,have been upheld by the courts. See e.g., <T3>Frons</T3> v. <T3>FBI,</T3> 571 F. Supp. 1241, 1243, D. Mass. 1983). Reference to andSection;2.112(d) was inadvertently omitted and will again be included for clarity.Section 2.120(c)(2) Advance Payment of Fees One commentor objected to the language ``i.e., payment before work is commencedor continued'' contained in this section. This language is taken directlyfrom the OMB Guidelines and is intended to define ``advance payment'',not to imply that payment will be required before records are actuallyreleased. Although the Agency does not believe it is proscribed from requiringpayment prior to release of records, it is not the Agency's general policyto require payment prior to the release of records. Section 2.120(d) Fee Waivers or Reductions Three commentors objected to EPA's incorporation of the Fee Waiver Guidelinesissued by the Department of Justice. Although not adopted verbatim, EPAhas incorporated the criteria set out in the DOJ guidelines. After carefulconsideration of commentors' objections to the fee waiver guidelines, theAgency has determined to keep the guidelines as set out in the proposedrule. The factors set forth in the guidelines address each word of thestatutory standard, and merely give guidance in the application of thestatutory standard. In response to the concerns expressed by some commentors, EPA believesthat requestors seeking a fee waiver will qualify if they provide adequateinformation to satisfy each of the fee waiver factors. Each request willbe determined on a case-by-case basis since the statute provides no basisfor any fee waiver ``presumptions''. One commentor claimed that the requirement of submitting supporting informationwith a request for a fee waiver is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. Contrary to that claim, the Office ofInformation and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget,which holds responsibility for the Paperwork Reduction Act's implementation,has determined that such a requirement is not an ``information collectionrequest'' within the meaning of that Act. One commentor suggested the Agency simply restate the statutory languageregarding waiver of fees. To do so would not satisfy the statutory requirementwhich directs that the Agency ``promulgate regulations . . . establishingprocedures and guidelines for determining when such fees should be waivedor reduced.'' Section 2.120(d)(6) Appeal of Fee Waiver Requests This section has been amended to reflect a revised delegation signed bythe Administrator, delegating the authority to decide fee waiver appealsto the General Counsel. This authority had previously been delegated tothe Assistant Administrator for External Affairs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must submit a Regulatory Impact Analysisfor all ``major'' rules. EPA has determined that this regulation is nota major rule for purposes of Executive Order 12291 because it will nothave a $100 million annual effect on the economy, will not result in amajor increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies or geographic regions, andwill not have significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in the domestic or export markets.Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. EPA has basedall administrative decisions on this rule on adequate information concerningthe need for and consequences of the rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule does not come under the requirements of the Paperwork ReductionAct, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq., because it makes no independent request orrequirement to collect information. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>This regulation will not have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. These changes to EPA's regulations will not imposesignificant additional costs on small entities. Therefore, a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601et seq., is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 2 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Freedom of information, Public information.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 24, 1987. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.

Section 2.100 is amended by revising paragraph (b) and by adding paragraphs(e) through (k) to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;2.100 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(b) ``EPA Record'' or, simply ``record'' means any document, writing, photograph,sound or magnetic recording, drawing, or other similar thing by which informationhas been preserved, from which the information can be retrieved and copied,and over which EPA has possession or control. It may include copies ofthe records of other Federal agencies (see andSection;2.111(d)). The termincludes informal writings (such as drafts and the like), and also includesinformation preserved in a form which must be translated or decipheredby machine in order to be intelligible to humans. The term includes documentsand the like which were created or acquired by EPA, its predecessors, itsofficers, and its employees by use of Government funds or in the courseof transacting official business. However, the term does not include materialswhich are the personal records of an EPA officer or employee. Nor doesthe term include materials published by non-Federal organizations whichare readily available to the public, such as books, journals, and periodicalsavailable through reference libraries, even if such materials are in EPA'spossession. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(e) The term `` `commercial use' request'' refers to a request from oron behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthersthe commercial, trade or profit interests of the requestor or the personon whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requestorproperly belongs in this category, EPA must determine the use to whicha requestor will put the documents requested. Moreover, where EPA has reasonablecause to doubt the use to which a requestor will put the records sought,or where that use is not clear from the request itself, EPA may seek additionalclarification before assigning the request to a specific category. (f) The term ``non-commercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is referencedin paragraph (e) of this section, and which is operated solely for thepurpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are notintended to promote any particular product or industry. (g) The term ``educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a publicor private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate highereducation, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institutionor professional education, and an institution of vocational education,which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. (h) The term ``representative of the news media'' refers to any personactively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated topublish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means informationthat is about current events or that would be of current interest to thepublic. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stationsbroadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (butonly in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of ``news'')who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the generalpublic. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover,as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic disseminationof newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative mediawould be included in this category. In the case of ``freelance'' journalists,they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstratea solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, eventhough not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be theclearest proof, but EPA may also look to the past publication record ofa requestor in making this determination. (i) The term ``search'' includes all time spent looking for material thatis responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identificationof material within documents. Searching for material must be done in themost efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for boththe EPA and the requestor. For example, EPA will not engage in line-by-linesearch when merely duplicating an entire document would prove the lessexpensive and quicker method of complying with a request. ``Search'' willbe distinguished, moreover, from ``review'' of material in order to determinewhether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (j) of thissection). Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.(j) The term ``review'' refers to the process of examining documents locatedin response to a request that is for a commercial use (see paragraph (e)of this section) to determine whether any portion of any document locatedis permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documentsfor disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwiseprepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolvinglegal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. (Documentsmust be reviewed in responding to all requests; however, review time mayonly be charged to Commercial Use Requesters.)(k) The term ``duplication'' refers to the process of making a copy ofa document necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies can takethe form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readabledocumentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy providedmust be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.3. Section 2.101 is amended by adding paragraph (d) to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 2.101 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy on disclosure of EPA records. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(d) When documents responsive to a request are maintained for distributionby agencies operating statutory-based fee schedule programs, such as, butnot limited to, the Government Printing Office or the National TechnicalInformation Service, EPA will inform the requester of the steps necessaryto obtain records from the sources.4. Section 2.113 is amended by revising paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) toread as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 2.113 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Initial denials of requests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(d)(1) Each initial determination to deny a request shall be written, signed,and dated, and, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2), shall contain areference to the Request Identification Number, shall identify the recordsthat are being withheld (individually, or, if the denial covers a largenumber of similar records, by described category), and shall state thebasis for denial for each record or category of records being withheld.(2) No initial determination shall reveal the existence or nonexistenceof records if identifying the mere fact of the existence or nonexistenceof those records would reveal confidential business information, confidentialpersonal information or classified national security information. Insteadof identifying the existence or nonexistence of the records, the initialdetermination shall state that the request is denied because either therecords do not exist or they are exempt from mandatory disclosure underthe applicable provision of 5 U.S.C. 552(b). No such determination shallbe made without the concurrence of the General Counsel or his designee.The General Counsel has designated the Contracts and Information Law Branchto act on these requests for concurrence. See andSection; 2.121 for guidanceon initial determinations denying, in limited circumstances, the existenceof certain law enforcement records or information.(e) If the decision to deny a request is made by an authorized EPA employeeother than the person signing the determination letter, that other person'sidentity and position shall be stated in the determination letter.(f) Each initial determination which denies, in whole or in part, a requestfor one or more existing, located EPA records (including determinationsdescribed in andSection; 2.113(d)(2) of this section) shall state that therequester may appeal the initial denial by sending a written appeal tothe address shown in andSection; 2.106(a) within 30 days after receipt ofthe determination. An initial determination which only denies the existenceof records, however, will not include a notice of appeal rights. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>5.

A denialdetermination shall also state the name and position of each EPA officeror employee who directed that the appeal be denied. Such a determinationshall further state that the person whose request was denied may obtainde novo judicial review of the denial by complaint filed with the districtcourt of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides,or has his principal place of business, or in which the Agency recordsare situated, or in the District of Columbia, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).(b) No determination denying an appeal shall reveal the existence or nonexistenceof records if identifying the mere fact of the existence or nonexistenceof those records would reveal confidential business information, confidentialpersonal information or classified national security information.

However,if EPA uses a contractor to search for, reproduce or disseminate recordsresponsive to a request, the cost to the requester shall not exceed thecost of the Agency itself performing the service. (1) There are four categories of requests. Fees for each of the categorieswill be charged as follows:(i) Commercial use requests. If the request seeks disclosure of recordsfor a commercial use, the requester shall be charged for the time spentsearching for the requested record, reviewing the record to determine whetherit should be disclosed and for the cost of each page of duplication. Commercialuse requesters should note that EPA also may charge fees to them for timespent searching for and/or reviewing records, even if EPA fails to locatethe records or if the records located are determined to be exempt fromdisclosure.(ii) Requests from an educational or non-commercial scientific institutionwhose purpose is scholarly or scientific research, involving a requestwhich is not for a commercial use and seeks disclosure of records. In thecase of such a request, the requester shall be charged only for the duplicationcost of the records, except that the first 100 pages of duplication shallbe furnished without charge.(iii) Requests from a representative of the news media, involving a requestwhich is not for a commercial use and seeks disclosure of records. In thecase of such a request, the requester shall be charged only for the duplicationcost of the records, except that the first 100 pages of duplication shallbe furnished without charge.(iv) All other requests. If the request seeks disclosure of records otherthan as described in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section,the requester shall be charged the full cost of search and duplication.However, the first two hours of search time (or its cost equivalent) andthe first 100 pages of duplication (or their cost equivalent) shall befurnished without charge.

Any requestmade by an individual who specifies an affiliation with or representationof a corporation, association, law firm, or other organization shall bedeemed to be a request by the corporation, association, law firm, or otherorganization. If an organization placed on the delinquent list can showthat the person who made the request for which payment was overdue didnot make the request on behalf of the organization the organization willbe removed from the delinquent list but the name of the individual shallremain on the list.
