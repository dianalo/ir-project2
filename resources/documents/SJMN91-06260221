But he agreed with Quayle that there are toomany suits.;   &quot;We don't seem to try to resolve budding problems anymore,&quot;Seitman said. &quot;We do what 'good Americans' do -- we sue.;   &quot;As lawyers, wemust take the lead in spurring this nation to drop its fixation withlitigation and focus on other less costly, less time-consuming remedies.&quot;;  Seitman's suggestions differed greatly from Quayle's presentation last monthof Bush administration proposals to set nationwide limits on the right to sueand collect damages.;   Seitman called for greatly increasing the number ofcases that are diverted to non-court procedures such as arbitration,settlement conferences and informal mediation. He said the state shouldre-examine the current $50,000 ceiling on suits referred to arbitration andshould experiment with non-court resolution before any suit goes to trial. Healso said lawyers should be required to tell clients of all non-courtoptions.;   The outgoing president of the California Judges Association,Warren Conklin, made some similar points in his speech to the bar.;   &quot;Perhapswe need fewer judges, not more,&quot; said Conklin, a San Luis Obispo CountySuperior Court judge. He said some jury selection might be conducted bymagistrates or even by the lawyers in the case, and matters of child custodyand support should be kept out of judges' hands as much as possible.;  Quayle's comments last month at the American Bar Association convention,blaming a proliferation of lawyers for the nation's economic woes, got acircumspect reply from State Bar delegates and a blunt rebuttal from AbnerMikva, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.;   Thedelegates, from local bar associations around California, passed a sanitizedversion of a resolution endorsing ABA President John Curtin's reply toQuayle.;   All references to Quayle were removed from the text of theresolution, because of bar leaders' fear of violating a U.S. Supreme Court banon using bar dues money to fund political activities over members' objections.Speakers referred to the &quot;Q-word,&quot; and a hand-drawn quail was projected on ascreen above the podium during the debate.;   Mikva, a former Democraticcongressman from Illinois and a 1979 judicial appointee of President Carter,took on Quayle directly in his luncheon speech.;   &quot;Lawyer-bashing has becomea very popular sport,&quot; Mikva said. &quot;As Vice President Quayle exemplified, somemembers of our profession are some of the most avid participants.&quot;;   WhileQuayle said the nation has too many lawyers, Mikva contrasted the U.S. ratioof one lawyer for every 360 inhabitants to one per 10,000 in China, one per15,000 in Hungary and one per 20,000 in Bulgaria.;   &quot;Where is there moreindividual freedom?&quot; he asked. &quot;Lawyers only exist in a free society . . .Bashing lawyers is really bashing the dream.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Anaheim  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910916  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  543  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 16, 199100260221,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
