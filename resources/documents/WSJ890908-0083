With the expected guilty plea and cooperation of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s former head of stock-loan operations, Dennis T. Palmeri, the government could expose a variety of wrongdoing that has long been suspected of flourishing in stock-loan operations.    The government, say people familiar with the probe, is investigating whether some takeover speculators made illegal payments to stock-loan employees, including kickbacks to top officials. The government is also probing whether officials in stock-loan departments of major brokerage firms engaged in a scheme in which they skimmed money from stock-loan fees and then laundered the stolen funds overseas. And investigators are examining possible violations of the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T, which governs the amount of credit that brokers can extend for customers' stock purchases.    Shearson's Mr. Palmeri, who resigned from the securities firm in June, has negotiated a plea agreement with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office that calls for him to plead guilty to felony charges and cooperate with the government's investigation, according to individuals familiar with the case.    Mr. Palmeri couldn't be reached for comment. His lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin, and federal prosecutors involved in the case either declined to comment or couldn't be reached. It couldn't be learned what Mr. Palmeri has told government investigators.    Stock loans are a lucrative but little-known business on Wall Street in which securities firms and investors lend big blocks of securities to each other in exchange for fees or the use of money. But what started decades ago as a service to clients who needed quick delivery of securities that may not have been available has mushroomed into a money-making machine fueled by takeover speculators, pension funds and other investors and operating almost anonymously from the back offices of major brokerage firms.    The stock-loan business, while vital to Wall Street, is &quot;subject to a great many abuses,&quot; says Ira Lee Sorkin, a New York lawyer who brought several stock-loan abuse cases when he headed the Securities and Exchange Commission's New York office from 1984 to 1986.    &quot;Let me tell you, there's a lot of money to be made in stock loans,&quot; says Mr. Sorkin. But he adds: &quot;Based on my experience, there was very little supervision over the stock-loan activities of firms.&quot; What makes supervision of the industry even more difficult, he says, are the large numbers of stock-loan &quot;finders,&quot; or firms that seek commissions from matching up lenders and borrowers. These commission arrangements often lead to kickbacks and other fraud, Mr. Sorkin says.    The stock-loan business &quot;is a back-office function -- where favors are a normal part of doing business -- that most senior managements don't understand and therefore don't have the relevant controls to police,&quot; says Wall Street analyst A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc.    While they may not understand it, managements do know that stock-loan departments can reap big profits. Accordingly, salaries of some stock-loan employees now rival those of top stock and bond traders, Wall Street executives say.    The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office has been probing the stock-loan business for at least the past two years, people familiar with the investigation say. Now, with Mr. Palmeri's expected cooperation, years of possible wrongdoing involving stock loans could be exposed.    Mr. Palmeri, who held the title of executive vice president at Shearson, a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co., was a major player in the stock-loan industry. His stock-loan department typically generated over $100 million in revenue a year, say industry officials. &quot;Dennis was a big wheeler-dealer,&quot; says the head of a stockloan department on Wall Street who asked not to be identified.    Mr. Palmeri handled billions of dollars of securities and his influence was felt by other firms that dealt in stock loans. Among his other dealings, he was an active supplier of securities to such major takeover speculators as Ivan F. Boesky, who is now in jail.    Indeed, people familiar with the government's probe say it has been aided either directly or indirectly by the investigation of Mr. Boesky for insider trading.    In recent years, the SEC has brought a variety of civil charges involving securities-law violations by the stock-loan departments of brokerage firms. Criminal charges have been rare.    But in 1986, a former supervisor in the stock-receiving department at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. pleaded guilty to three felony charges related to a scheme that defrauded Merrill of $500,000 in interest income on borrowed stock.    The government alleged that the head of a stock-loan finder firm and at least two Merrill Lynch employees arranged bogus loans of stock to Merrill Lynch that allowed the finder firm to illegally pocket interest income.    In a 1985 civil case, the SEC censured Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., alleging that its stock-loan department in September 1982 used a total of $39.3 million in securities fully paid for by customers as collateral for loans obtained by Thomson McKinnon. Stock-loan departments can use as collateral securities that are bought by customers partially on credit; however, they aren't allowed to use fully paid securities for such a purpose without the customer's approval.    Thomson McKinnon settled the SEC case without admitting or denying wrongdoing.    In this and other SEC enforcement actions brought since 1971, the SEC has punished brokerage firms by levying fines equal to several days' stock-loan profits. </TEXT></DOC>
