It was 215 feet long and 100 feet wide, among the largest of the123 fixed platforms that dot the British sector of the North Seaoil field. A fire burned constantly at its top, flaming off excessgas.   The $901 million Piper Alpha, owned by Occidental Petroleum,began pumping oil and gas in December 1976 from its location 120miles off eastern Scotland and was among the oldest of the NorthSea rigs.   Last year, the 34,000-ton platform produced a daily average of23 million cubic feet of gas and 167,200 barrels of oil.   It was linked to four other platforms in one of the mostprofitable sectors of the North Sea field discovered in the 1960s.   More than 200 men worked the Piper Alpha, earning up to $1,000 aweek in dangerous jobs. They lived on the platform for up to twoweeks at a time, on a duty schedule of 12 hours on and 12 off.   The Piper Alpha was pinned to the sea bed and supported by steelstilts, with most of its 649-foot height submerged. It included ahelicopter landing pad used to ferry the workers out from Aberdeen,and had lifeboats with a total capacity of 300 people.</TEXT></DOC>
