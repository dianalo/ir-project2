If true, it would be a major psychological, military andeconomic victory for the Khmer Rouge, the largest of threeguerrilla groups fighting the pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia.   In a radio broadcast, the Khmer Rouge military command describedthe taking of Pailin on Sunday as ``a victory of strategic andhistoric meaning.''   During a decade of guerrilla war before Vietnam's professedSeptember withdrawal, the Khmer Rouge had been unable to establisha viable ``liberated zone'' inside Cambodia.   The short, preliminary report said the guerrillas ``utterlyrouted'' the defending government troops and inflicted severecasualties to provincial and district forces. The report could notbe independently verified.   It said parts of three Vietnamese divisions, whose soldiers weredisguised as Cambodian troops, were also routed and forced toretreat east of Route 10. The Khmer Rouge claims Vietnam has leftbehind tens of thousands of disguised soldiers.   The Khmer Rouge report said the victors seized 13 artillerypieces, hundreds of anti-aircraft guns, four tanks, eight trucksand tons of ammunition.   The report was broadcast just 15 minutes after the allegedcapture of Pailin. A transcript was made available by a Westernembassy today.   Pailin, located opposite Thailand's Chanthaburi province, isrich in rubies and sapphires, which have been mined in the areasince at least the late 19th century.   Some analysts have speculated the Khmer Rouge want Pailin notonly to boost morale among its fighters but as economic insuranceshould Thailand and China lessen or cut their support.   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia for four years until Vietnam's1978 invasion, sending hundreds of thousands of people to theirdeath as it tried to convert the country into a radical agrariancommune. Many Cambodians fear the Khmer Rouge will return to power.   Fighting in Pailin has been regarded by analysts as a major testof strength between the Khmer Rouge and the government.   ``I don't see any possibility it can fall into enemy hands,''Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen told foreign journalists in PhnomPenh a month ago.   At the time, prominent Phnom Penh editor Khieu Kanharith alsosaid the best troops of each side were contesting the town. Theeditor said on some days as many as 2,000 mortar shells werefalling on Pailin.   By most accounts, the Khmer Rouge and its coalition partnershope to seize significant territory in western Cambodia and forcethe Phnom Penh government to the negotiating table. A probabletarget is the region's largest urban center, Battambang, about 40miles northeast of Pailin.   The broadcast by the Khmer Rouge command urged fighters to``fully defend the strategic town of Pailin,'' continue attacks andforce opponents to the negotiating table.   The Khmer Rouge's two non-communist partners have also scoredgains since the Vietnamese troop withdrawal in late September.Western diplomats and resistance leaders say the partners' fortuneshave been boosted significantly by sophisticated anti-tank weaponsthat have arrived in the past few months.   The sources say many of the weapons were sent by France, whichdenies shipping any arms to the resistance.   Reliable sources also say the United States pays the cost ofsome of training in the anti-tank weapons. Washington deniesproviding lethal aid to the resistance.   Officials in Bangkok said, meanwhile, that Prime MinisterChatichai Choonhavan of Thailand will meet four top Beijing leadersand perhaps Cambodian resistance chief Prince Norodom Sihanouk in athree-day visit to China.   Cambodia is excepted to be a major topic of discussion, theofficials said. Chatichai is to leaves for China on Tuesday.   China and Thailand are key backers of Cambodia's guerrillacoalition. The Thais allow military supplies, principally fromChina, to travel through its territory to rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
