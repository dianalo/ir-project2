Report Finds </HL><SO> </SO><CO> FORGN FREST LATAM AFRIC </CO><IN> ENV </IN><DATELINE> LONDON (AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The increasing demands of the world's population, now heading toward six billion, are damaging the basic natural resources on which all life depends, according to an annual United Nations report.    The 1988 State of World Population Report, released Wednesday, said the Earth is gaining 80 million people a year, losing topsoil and tropical forests, and creating desert land.    &quot;The Earth is capable of supporting the increasing needs of the next century,&quot; but only if industrialized and developing countries cooperate effectively to reverse the environmental destruction, the report said.    &quot;All countries must face the fact that the combination of population and industrial growth could destroy the land, water and air on which everything else depends,&quot; said Dr. Nafis Sadik, a Pakistani physician who is executive director of the U.N. Population Fund.    At a news conference, Dr. Sadik expressed hope that action by governments, individuals and international organizations to curb population growth and to encourage conservation and economic development will &quot;safeguard the future of our planet.&quot;    But &quot;population and resources could become more seriously out of balance unless we do something about it today,&quot; she said.    With the world's population now at more than five billion and expected to reach six billion in the next 12 years, the report said that &quot;slower growth and more even distribution of population&quot; would help take the pressure off agricultural land, forests, and water and energy sources.    Every year, the report said, the world adds the equivalent of a nation the size of Mexico to the population -- about 80 million people. Nearly all of this growth is in the developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, which are least capable of absorbing it, the report said.    Even though most developing countries are trying to reduce population growth, their needs are increasing and their attempts to find new land and increase food production are destroying the environment rapidly, the report said.    Tropical forests are shrinking at a rate of 27 million acres a year, according to the report. Topsoil is being lost at the rate of 26 billion tons a year. About 13 million acres of deserts are being created each year, and about half the world's irrigated land is in danger.    By the end of the century, half the world's population will be living in urban areas, and one-fifth of the urban population will live in &quot;megacities&quot; of four million or more, the report said.    Dr. Sadik said industrialized countries must &quot;lead the attack on the population problem&quot; and develop safer technologies for industrial growth.    In China, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand and South Korea, she said, population growth has dropped significantly in the past decade, but growth rates remain high in many other countries.    Last year, Dr. Sadik said, one promising development was that 10 countries in sub-Sahara Africa, which has the highest population growth rates in the world and is &quot;overwhelmed by economic problems,&quot; adopted national population policies aimed at limiting growth. </TEXT></DOC>
