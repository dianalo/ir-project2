(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorney Ervin Lee has been known to acceptchickens from financially strapped farmers as payment for his advice.   In exchange for taking the reduced payment, Lee, of Minot, getsfree legal research and information from the state's Farm LawProject.   ``Cash is always better,'' Lee said this week. ``(But) if peoplecan afford to pay whatever, I believe that's what's important.''   Two agencies, North Dakota Legal Services and Legal Assistance ofNorth Dakota, founded the Farm Law Project in 1985 to provide freeresources for lawyers who agree to represent North Dakota farmers atreduced rates.   ``Until recently, very few attorneys concentrated on agriculturallaw,'' said Jason Coffel, a spokesman for the project. ``But now,since last year's drought and the falling-out of the agricultureeconomy, it's become a necessity.''   Jim Fitzsimmons, director of North Dakota Legal Services, saidthe project helped both poor farmers who need legal advice andattorneys who have questions about farm law.   ``A lot of farmers don't go to lawyers,'' he said. ``What we'retrying to do is generate a body of attorneys who will work with farmclients.''   Under the Farm Law Project, Minot attorney Paul Temanson conductsbackground research for cases and provides up-to-date information onfarm-related law through newsletters and public forums. He alsoworks directly on some cases.   Attorneys who use the service reduce their fees however they seefit, Fitzsimmons said, adding, ``Sometimes it's unbelievable; theydon't charge a thing.''   One of the Farm Law Project's more notable cases is a 1987lawsuit against the Farmers Home Administration that contests theagency's practice of confiscating government crop subsidy paymentsof some farmers who are in debt to the agency. While a ruling ispending, there has been a nationwide moratorium on suchconfiscations.   The Farm Law Project is unique to North Dakota and assists asmany as 350 attorneys each year, Fitzsimmons said. He had no precisefigures on the number of farmers who benefit from the information.   Comments about the project have been generally positive,Fitzsimmons said. ``Attorneys I've heard from say, `Don't let thisthing go,''' he said.   ``It's important to have somebody watching one specific area andmaking that information readily available,'' Lee said.   Coffel said the project, which is financed by private grants,costs between $35,000 and $42,000 a year. Two grants expire Sept. 1,but a $7,500 emergency grant from the Otto Bremer Foundation of St.Paul, Minn., should carry the project through the end of the year,he said.   Despite the project's tight finances right now, Coffel said hewas not too worried about obtaining grant money for 1990.   ``I'm confident about the program,'' he said. ``I have everyreason to believe it's going to be up and running again next year.''</TEXT></DOC>
