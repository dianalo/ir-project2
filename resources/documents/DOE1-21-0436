The manifold advantages of cold storagesystems for example consist in their making use of low night tariffsor in the reduction of their rated thermal output to 40%. Reference ismade to the uses of cold storage systems. They are as a rule designedas ice storage units. Modern ice storage systems are designed as cylindricalplastic reservoirs holding 1100, 1700 or 3200 l, with storage capacitiesof 212, 317 or 352 kWh. Their modular design allows for all kinds ofconfigurations and combinations characterized by different storage values.Access is facilitated to their operational features, their design, andtheir installation.</TEXT></DOC>
