The home companies also get priority in thecenter's scheduling, and Mountain View's city staff will provide them withmarketing, technical and box office support.;    &quot;We have grown in many ways,and we needed more space,&quot; said TheatreWorks managing director Randy Adams,adding that Mountain View's 625-seat MainStage has about 200 seats more thanthe company's other home, Palo Alto's Lucie Stern Theatre.;    TheatreWorks,arguably the most prestigious performing-arts group on the Peninsula, has usedboth Lucie Stern and Menlo Park's Burgess Theatre in past seasons. Adams saidthe company will continue to use Lucie Stern but has given up its dates at theBurgess.;    During the 1991-92 season, TheatreWorks will produce five of its12 plays in Mountain View, beginning with a new musical, &quot;Go Down Garvey,&quot; inMay.;    Schola Cantorum plans to stage its entire 1991-92 season in MountainView, although Rosewall said the group's popular holiday sing-along toHandel's &quot;Messiah&quot; will still be held in the 2,750-seat Flint Center inCupertino.;    The Community School of Music andamp; Arts will present its MusicPlus series of multicultural family concerts and its Faculty Artists inConcert performances at the center, and the Friends of the Center, Inc. willbring about 35 nationally known touring artists to Mountain View each year.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KATHLEEN DONNELLY, Mercury News Entertainment Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910321  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  379  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 21, 199100081166,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
