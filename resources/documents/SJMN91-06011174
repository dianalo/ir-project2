If the Minnesota rulingis upheld on appeal, challenges to similar laws in other states would belikely.;    Judge Alexander invoked a procedure last week sending her decisionstraight to the State Supreme Court, enabling the court to review her decisionpromptly, perhaps within two months.;    Her opinion infuriated prosecutors.;   &quot;If it weren't so sad, it would almost be laughable,&quot; said Richard M.Wintory, director of the National Drug Prosecution Center in Alexandria, Va.,a research arm of the National District Attorneys' Association.;    &quot;Cracktrafficking is the most serious form of black-on-black crime today, and forher to call crack penalties racially discriminatory is a cruel joke.&quot;;    Butby coincidence, the departing director of the Minnesota Office of Drug Policy,Jan Smaby, issued a report on the same day as the judge's ruling that reachedsimilar conclusions.;    &quot;All I've seen is anecdotal evidence that the twodrugs are different, most of it from police and prosecutors who tend to simplyrepeat each other after a while,&quot; Smaby said in an interview.;    &quot;It's timewe looked at this on a national basis. Drug policy should not be set accordingto anything less than scientific evidence.&quot;;    In an interview Wednesday, thejudge said: &quot;There had better be a good reason for any law that has thepractical effect of disproportionately punishing members of one racial group.If crack was significantly more deadly or harmful than cocaine, that might bea good enough reason. But there just isn't enough evidence that they'redifferent enough to justify the radical difference in penalties.&quot;;    Drugexperts acknowledge that few, if any, scientific studies have been done totest whether crack is more addictive or harmful than powder cocaine.;    As ageneral proposition, drug experts say that a drug that is smoked, as crackusually is, or injected into the bloodstream reaches the brain faster than thesame drug if it is snorted, the normal way of taking powdered cocaine.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ROBB LONDON, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910111  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  530  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, January 11, 199100011174,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
