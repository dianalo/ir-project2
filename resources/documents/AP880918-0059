The daily Hadashot, quoting foreign sources, said theexperimental part of the program would last two years and that thespy satellite is to be carried by Israel's improved Jericho-IImissile.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refused to confirm or deny thereport.   ``I don't deal with subjects of this type,'' Shamir said in aninterview with state-run Israel radio. ``You have to turn to thepeople and industries that deal with this.''   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told the radio: ``I can't knowabout every subject.'' Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Weinreich anda Foreign Ministry spokesman declined comment.   In Washington, the Pentagon and the State Department said theyhad no information on the report.   The newspaper did not further identify its foreign sources usedas a basis for the story. Such attribution is sometimes used byIsraeli newspapers to get around restrictions of the Israelimilitary censor.   Unnamed defense experts were quoted by Hadashot as sayingputting up a spy satellite could increase Israel's deterrence,providing accurate and immediate information and the investmentwould pay for itself by reducing reconnaissance flights.   The Geneva-based International Defense Review reported in Julythat Israel had successfully fired its Jericho missile into theMediterranean sea. Its maximum range was to reach 920 miles, themagazine wrote.   Two major dailies, Yediot Ahronot and Maariv, devoted front-pagearticles Sunday to Israel's reported plan to launch a spy satellite.   A decision by Israel's 25-member Cabinet, which holds itsregular meetings Sunday, was due on the launching date, Yediotquoted the British magazine Flight International as saying.   Yuval Neeman, head of Israel's Space Agency, told The AssociatedPress that Israel was in the final stages of developing satellitesfor use in communications and science. He said the first Israelisatellite would probably be launched in 1992 by the European spaceconsortium Ariane.   Asked to comment on the reports about a reconnaissancesatellite, Neeman said: ``Our present work is related to scientificexperiments and communications. It doesn't mean that sometime inthe future Israel won't move in such direction (reconnaissance).''   Last month, Israel announced plans to launch two communicationsatellites, Amos-1 and Amos-2, in early 1990s. The satellites areto be launched by the French Ariane rocket.   The satellite was the lead item on Israel radio throughout theday.</TEXT></DOC>
