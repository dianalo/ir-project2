The problem with flat-screen displays in laptop computersand hand-held TVs is that they can't match the oldcathode-ray tube in brightness, contrast or speed of imagemovement. The problem with the CRT, on the other hand, isthat it's big and heavy.   Researchers in California and France say the solution liesin the &quot;microtip&quot; display, which is built something like adouble-paned window. Millions of cone-shaped &quot;electron guns&quot;etched on the back pane shoot electrons through a vacuum tothe front pane, where tiny dots called pixels light up toform pictures.   CRTs take the same approach, but they use one largeelectron gun at the back of the tube to shoot electrons tothe screen, where the pixels light up. Most of today's flatscreens, &quot;liquid-crystal displays,&quot; operate on a differentprinciple, forming a picture with dots that turn opaque whenelectricity is passed through.   Scientists invented the microtip technology nearly 20years ago, but only recently has factory equipment becomeavailable that can etch the electron guns, or &quot;tips,&quot; onglass. The most impressive prototype is a six-inch-diagonalmonochrome screen built last year by the French Atomic EnergyCommission, says David Mentley, a technology analyst. ColorayDisplay, a Fremont, Calif., start-up, has developed apostage-stamp-sized color microtip screen and plans to beginmaking larger ones in about a year if it can find financing.   Proponents say that microtip screens, also calledfield-emission displays, consume less power and should be farcheaper to make than flat screens. Microtip screens couldgive U.S. industry a chance to create high-definition TVsthat steal fire from Japanese companies' models, they argue.                                                                                                          Thermometers and Shots   For Timorous Patients                                                                                                          Makers of medical equipment use technology to make a visitto the doctor's office more pleasant.   A new thermometer takes the torment out oftemperature-taking by peering into the ear to check body heatin two seconds. Built by Thermoscan of San Diego, the deviceresembles an otoscope, the gadget that the doctor sticks inyour ear during checkups. The device measures infrared lightgenerated by the eardrum's heat; a computer chip translatesthe measurement into a temperature reading on a smalldisplay. Thermoscan's device, meant for physicians, costs$299; the company says it plans to sell a $99 household modelthis summer.   Shots could be less traumatic with a device that injectsdrugs without a needle. Bioject, Portland, Ore., has a $475gadget that injects drugs using pressurized gas to send a jetof medicine through the skin. The company, which says its&quot;Biojector&quot; is safer than a needle and nearly painless evenfor infants, plans to sell a home-use model for about $350for patients who need to inject themselves for such ailmentsas allergies, diabetes or asthma.                                                                                                          Cost of Fast Modems   Is Falling Fast                                                                                                          Personal computers make faster calls with a speedy newbreed of modems, the devices that let computers talk overphone lines.   Millions of PC users employ modems to tie into electronicmailboxes, to tap data services such as CompuServe and tocontact the office computer from home. But today's mostpopular modems are relatively slow, transmitting data at2,400 &quot;baud,&quot; or bits a second. At that speed, it takesroughly four seconds for a computer to send or receive atypical screen full of text.   Much faster 9,600-baud modems, which transmit a screen oftext in a second, have been around for years, but at pricesclose to $2,000. However, in the past several months, streetprices for certain new models have fallen under $500, animportant price threshold for such PC users as corporationsand law offices.   Intel, Practical Peripherals and others have been able toslash prices thanks to new technologies that cram circuitryinto far fewer chips than before. Analysts expect fast-modemprices to fall to $200 in a few years, making them attractiveto home users.   The prospect of proliferating 9,600-baud modems hasspurred database services to add 9,600-baud capabilities.CompuServe offers the high-speed hookup in 20 U.S. cities andplans 41 more by June. Mead Data Central's Nexis and Lexisservices began offering 9,600-baud rates in 44 cities lastyear.   The attraction for PC users: Phone charges are cheaper at9,600 baud because data travels faster. CompuServe charges$12.50 an hour at 2,400 baud; $22.50 at the much-faster 9,600baud. Dow Jones's News/Retrieval charges as much as $2.85 aminute at either speed. At that rate, the $500 modem couldpay for itself after a few hours' use.                                                                                                          Special Brand of Paint   Heats Like a Radiator                                                                                                          Would you like to decorate with warm colors? Literally?   Rustol Chemicals has a new paint that heats up whenelectricity is applied. The paint is a secret concoction oforganic and inorganic ingredients that reach temperatures ashigh as 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit, consuming far less powerthan conventional heating methods, Rustol says.   The Tokyo company says it's talking to U.S. companies thathope to use the hot paint on pre-fabricated wall panels forroom heat, on jet wings for de-icing and on sidewalks toclear snow.</TEXT></DOC>
