Inc. to acquire the Network Security shares it doesn't already own for $9 each.    The transaction has an estimated value of about $105.5 million. Inspectorate, an investment holding company, owns 1.3 million Network Security shares, purchased for about $9 each last December from Network Security's chairman and chief executive officer, George K. Broady. Including convertible bonds, stock options and warrants, Network Security has about 13 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.    Network Security finances and sells security equipment to dealers. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, the company's shares closed at $8.50, up 50 cents, on volume of more than one million shares.    Network Security said the transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and a fairness opinion from an independent investment banker. It also is contingent on Inspectorate's reaching a separate agreement to acquire the shares held by three major Network Security shareholders, including Automated Security (Holdings) PLC of Britain, which owns a 25% stake in Network Security.    Earlier this year, Network Security sold its Network Multi-Family Security Corp. unit, which installs security systems in apartment complexes, to Inspectorate for about $39 million in cash and notes.    In January, Network Security rejected an offer from Inspectorate to acquire the shares it didn't already own for $7 each, or about $87 million. Despite that decision, John W. Hesse, Network Security president, said the company continued to have discussions with Inspectorate. </TEXT></DOC>
