GarciaStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The almost eerie euphoria that has permeated the stock market so far this year sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average spiraling 35.72 points to its ninth consecutive record close in the busiest trading day in New York Stock Exchange history.    Big Board volume yesterday hit a record 253.1 million shares, topping the 244.7 million shares traded Dec. 19. The volume of shares advancing in price on the Big Board -- 185.8 million shares -- was nearly triple the volume of stocks whose prices declined. The number of Big Board stocks closing higher swamped the number of decliners, 1,078 to 571.    The explosion stunned many stock market professionals, who instead had expected investors to take profits following the market's relentless advance in the new year. Professionals attributed yesterday's rally to a combination of near-panic institutional buying and a sudden return to the market of substantial individual investors.    &quot;The institutions are panicking into buying anything blue chip and high tech,&quot; said Ralph Bloch, technical analyst at Raymond James andamp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. &quot;They simply had too much cash&quot; as the new year began, he said.    The Big Board transactions ticker ran several minutes behind the trading a number of times, indicating a backup of the smaller orders typically associated with individual investors. &quot;The stock market is front-page news again&quot; and individual investors suddenly were calling brokers they hadn't talked to in months, said Peter DaPuzzo, director of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York.    Gerald Simmons, a managing director in the equity trading department at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York, said, &quot;We'd have a buy order in a stock and then go around looking for a seller, but all we'd find were other buyers.&quot;    Slight gains by the dollar in the currency markets, after its steep declines earlier in the week, helped to spur yesterday's stock market advance, market observers said. While the dollar's recent drop hasn't hit the stock market directly, it had produced a string of bond market declines that observers say had been holding back the astonishing January stock market rally.    Yesterday's performance by the dollar broke the bond market's losing string, as prices of government bonds rose about a quarter-point, following three consecutive sessions in which they declined about half a point each day. Stock-index futures soared along with stock prices.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average was clearly the star of the spurt. Its point gain amounted to 1.5%, the biggest surge of the major market indexes. The Big Board's composite index, for example, rose the equivalent of about 1.25%, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index about 1% and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks about 0.66%.    Before yesterday, the broader market indexes had been outgaining the industrial average, which has now spurted nearly 175 points, or 9.2%, since the new year began.    Yesterday's buying spree got a boost from the rumor mill, too, as word spread on Wall Street that Chrysler Corp.'s big pension fund had decided to increase the percentage of its assets invested in the stock market. A Chrysler pension official denied the rumor, but added that such an option is constantly under review.    Some of yesterday's strong demand for stocks came from institutional traders in many Wall Street firms and specialists on the Big Board. As the market rallied, many institutional traders, in order to provide liquidity for their customers, sold stock they didn't own to the customers, hoping to buy it back later and possibly at a lower price. But with the market's relentless climb, many of these traders were to pay much steeper prices to buy back those shares.    One trader said that when Wall Street trading desks end up with more short than long positions, stock prices tend to go higher in the next session as traders try to cover the short positions.    ---   Busiest Trading Days                          NYSE VOLUME January 15, 1987         253,120,000 December 19, 1986        244,680,000 September 12, 1986       240,490,000 September 11, 1986       237,570,000 August 3, 1984           236,570,000 December 2, 1986         230,350,000 January 14, 1987         214,230,000 March 12, 1986           210,250,000 August 6, 1984           203,050,000 November 21, 1986        200,650,000</TEXT></DOC>
