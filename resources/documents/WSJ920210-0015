The success enjoyed by Mr. Tsongas, a flinty New Englanderunschooled in the ways of electronic politics, and Mr.Buchanan, an accomplished practitioner of the broadcast arts,illustrates the importance television plays in a presidentialrace -- and illuminates how candidates can mold television totheir own ends.</LP><TEXT>   On Wednesday night, NBC correspondent Andrea Mitchellbegan a spot on Mr. Tsongas by explaining that the formerMassachusetts senator is often disparaged as &quot;boring,earnest, terrible on television.&quot; But then she set out toportray Mr. Tsongas, a cancer survivor who has stubbornlyremained near the top of New Hampshire polls, as &quot;a man witha mission who has licked tougher odds than he faced thisyear&quot; and as a contender with &quot;ideas which have alreadyforced other Democrats to be more substantive in this year'scampaign.&quot;   A day earlier, Cable News Network anchor Bernard Shawintroduced a long segment on Mr. Buchanan by saying that he&quot;is portraying himself as the conservative messiah.&quot; And whenhe appeared live on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America&quot; thatmorning, the conservative commentator used his segment toproclaim that &quot;This campaign is really on the go&quot; and that hehas &quot;A bold vision to replace what they don't have inWashington.&quot; He held up a Boston Herald headline thatbellowed: &quot;Buchanan on the Move.&quot;   Such dynamics -- Mr. Tsongas grinding it out with aself-consciously down-home appeal, Mr. Buchanan brandishing anewspaper headline, magnifying its effect thousandfold andconveying a sense of movement in his campaign -- -have becomeimportant parts of the character of the campaign thus far.   While the campaign itself is being staged in the villagesand veterans posts of New Hampshire, much of the struggle isbeing conducted on television screens. And the view from theliving room, more than the view from the benches of acommunity center in a frosty New Hampshire town hall, helpsshape how the candidates are perceived. For that reason, TheWall Street Journal monitored more than 35 hours oftelevision news programming last week, including networkmorning and evening newscasts and political reports fromCable News Network.   Though the only voters who matter in the short term arethose in New Hampshire, which next Tuesday holds the firstprimary, television is giving the nation its firstperceptions of the candidates. Moreover, even in NewHampshire, where voters pride themselves on an intimate styleof campaigning, network newscasts play a role far moreimportant than generally recognized.   WMUR-TV, the main New Hampshire television station, isgiving the campaign comprehensive coverage. But its signaldoesn't reach all voters in the state. &quot;If you don't getcable up here, you don't get WMUR -- so for many people, it'sthe networks that shape the campaign,&quot; says Robert Kantack, aDemocratic activist in Jackson, N.H., a tiny village deep inthe White Mountains.   &quot;Sure, the candidates are going to coffees in NewHampshire homes, but the key events are played out on thescreen,&quot; says Paul Maslin, a Democratic political consultantnot affiliated with any of the 1992 contenders. &quot;If you don'tget on television, you're not campaigning.&quot;   Mr. Buchanan's television performances were a classicexample of how media appearances have almost come to replacerallies and factory visits as campaign events. &quot;The mediacoverage is so important that headlines and video packagesnow have political importance of their own,&quot; says RalphWhitehead, a University of Massachusetts journalism professorwho follows cultural and political trends.   Ms. Mitchell's report was typical of the sort oftelevision coverage Mr. Tsongas has been getting. CNN'sFrederick Allen, for example, characterized Mr. Tsongas asperhaps &quot;the first media `pet rock' who doesn't sink likeone.&quot; Moreover, a survey by the Center for Media and PublicAffairs, a nonpartisan Washington study group, found that 88%of the television coverage Mr. Tsongas received in the firstmonth of the 1992 campaign was positive -- by far the mostfavorable coverage given to any of the contenders.   In an age where the public has grave suspicions aboutpoliticians, Mr. Tsongas has made a virtue of his casual,unvarnished style, winning over voters -- and reporters.&quot;Journalists love candidates who are not slick andconventionally polished,&quot; says Robert Lichter, co-director ofthe media study center. &quot;There's a competition betweentelevision journalists and candidates over who sets theagenda, so journalists like candidates they don't have tocompete against.&quot;   Last week, television viewers in remote Orford on thewestern border of New Hampshire and in cozy Bartlett, in skicountry on the eastern border -- along with millions acrossthe country -- also were witnesses to the difficulties Gov.Bill Clinton of Arkansas is having as he tries to protect hiscampaign from charges that he was unfaithful to his wife andthat he angled to avoid the draft.   Indeed, CNN newscaster Catherine Crier compared Mr.Clinton's predicament to Chinese water torture -- &quot;a slow butsteady drip of potentially damaging allegations.&quot; Appearingon the daily &quot;Inside Politics&quot; program, Ms. Crier noted&quot;growing Democratic concerns about Clinton's electability&quot; --a theme that was prominent in network stories about effortsto promote a write-in campaign for Gov. Mario Cuomo in NewHampshire or to press other leading Democrats to plunge intothe race. As CBS correspondent Bob Schieffer noted Tuesdaynight, &quot;If Clinton's problems persist, many pros wonder abouthis electability even if he gets the nomination.&quot;   Mr. Clinton took further hits later in the week after thenetworks picked up questions raised by The Wall StreetJournal about the Arkansas governor's draft record.   But even with his difficulties, Mr. Clinton is aformidable force on the airwaves. Reports aboutpublic-opinion polls show him atop the field, in NewHampshire and elsewhere. Reports about charges against himcrowd out reports about what Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, Sen.Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and former Gov. Jerry Brown ofCalifornia are saying on the campaign trail.   &quot;Clinton is dominating the television,&quot; says Mr. Maslin,the Democratic political consultant, &quot;so he's dominating thecampaign.&quot;   The television study shows that Mr. Clinton had morecoverage in January than all his rivals combined -- but thathe is getting the least favorable coverage of the fiveDemocratic contenders. &quot;The classic thing is happening,&quot; saysMr. Lichter, the co-director of the media study center. &quot;Ashe was designated the front-runner, his coverage is gettingmore negative.&quot;   Television coverage of politics, to be sure, can beshallow and cursory. But last week's programming also showedhow the electronic medium can add texture and perspective topublic perceptions.   CBS's &quot;This Morning,&quot; for example, offered a long segmenton how sex scandals have affected presidential campaigns inthe past, even touching on charges that both Andrew Jacksonand his wife were bigamists. Talking with average voters inPortsmouth, N.H., Richard Threlkeld of CBS illustrated thelimited political appeal of President Bush's pet economicprescription, lowering the tax on capital gains. &quot;Evenlife-long Republicans who know and like George Bush say thatwhen it comes to capital gains, voters don't get it,&quot; hesays.   And James Wooten of ABC captured the difficulty theDemocrats are experiencing as they struggle in New Hampshireto have an impact with their economic appeals. &quot;No onemessage seems to have much more resonance than another,&quot; Mr.Wooten reported, &quot;and voters may simply have to make theirchoice, as they have before, on their instincts and intuitionabout the candidates.&quot;   The difference this time, however, is that televisionimages may be stronger than native instincts.   &quot;People here are exposed to more television than everbefore,&quot; says state senate Democratic whip Wayne King ofRumney, N.H., &quot;and people may not even know where theirnotions are coming from.&quot;   ---   Campaign Coverage                                                                                                          Number of stories about each candidate on the three majornetwork evening news shows in January 1992.
