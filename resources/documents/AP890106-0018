Council President Ray Hankes said Thursday a petition was filedJan. 4 with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the CommerceDepartment asking that countervailing duties be imposed on fresh,chilled and frozen pork products from Canada.   State pork associations and a number of U.S. meat packingcompanies also signed the petition. A ruling on the council'spetition is expected in about six months, he said.   ``A countervailing duty would eliminate the unfair advantageCanadian farmers have over U.S. pork producers because the Canadiangovernment subsidizes its hog production,'' Hankes said in astatement released here. ``Canadian pork producers can benefit frommore than 20 potential subsidy programs.''   There has been an import duty on live hogs from Canada since July1985, a move upheld by the U.S. Court of International Trade duringa lengthy appeals process.   But the American producers contend the import duty on live hogsdoesn't prevent Canada from slaughtering its hogs and shipping thepork to U.S. markets. The Commerce Department ruled in 1985 theimport duties on pork products were justified.   The U.S. Court of International Trade, acting on an appeal by theCanadian Meat Council, overruled the Commerce decision.   As a result, Canada has increased its shipments of pork into theUnited States by more than 52 percent since 1984, Hankes said.   The council also said imports of Canadian pork have reduced therevenues of U.S. hog producers by as much as $3.37 per 100 pounds ofhogs marketed in the first nine months of 1988, according to a studyby economist Glenn Grimes of the University of Missouri.   Overall, the imports from Canada were said to cost Americanproducers as much as $697 million in lost revenues last year.   The Agriculture Department said imports of Canadian pork productsin 1988 totaled a carcass weight equivalent of 440.2 million poundsthrough Dec. 3, according to Canadian government figures. Thatcompared with 501.5 million pounds for all of 1987 and 313.9 millionpounds in 1984.   Kevin Bost of the department's Economic Research Service said ina telephone interview the countervailing duties on live hogs fromCanada have trimmed the imports sharply, from more than 1.3 millionhead in 1984 to around 650,000 to 700,000 head last year. Shipmentsmay be around 700,000 head in 1989, he said.   According to USDA figures, American hog farmers produced around15.6 billion pounds of pork in 1988, an estimate of carcass weightsafter slaughter. The forecast calls for a slight increase this year.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department says privateexporters have sold the Soviet Union an additional 390,000 metrictons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department'sForeign Agricultural Service, said Thursday the wheat was part of 2million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export EnhancementProgram, or EEP.   The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement with theUnited States, now in its sixth year.   Sims said the wheat is for shipment in January and February.Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements, theSoviets have about 1.2 million tons still available under theprogram.   The Soviet Union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat underEEP arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement. Thepact expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31,1990.   With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 760,000 tonsof U.S. wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact. Sales alsoinclude 10.2 million tons of corn, along with some soybeans, soybeanmeal and sorghum.   Only the wheat is subsidized, however.   The EEP arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and otherdesignated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices inorder to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect freegovernment surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, orsubsidies.   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushelsof corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 390,000 tons ofwheat would be about 14.3 million bushels.   Sims said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of$22.83 per ton, or about 62 cents per bushel. He said the bonuses onthe 390,000 tons of wheat will be paid to five companies: CargillInc., 100,000 tons; Toepfer International Inc., 50,000; Ferruzzi USAInc., 150,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 50,000; and Peavy Co., 40,000.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Farmers have signed enough fragile land into along-range conservation program to reduce annual soil losses bynearly 600 million tons, according to the Agriculture Department.   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil ConservationService, said Thursday that about 28 million acres have beencontracted under the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP. The goalis to retire 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible landfrom crop production by 1990.   An agency spokeswoman, Leslie Wilder, said the 600 million tonsof soil saved each year would be enough to cover one square mile, or640 acres, to a depth of 429 feet.   Under the program, farmers agree to take qualified land from cropproduction for 10 years. In return, they get federal assistance toplant the land in protective grass or trees and then draw annualrental payments. Those average around $49 per acre each year.</TEXT></DOC>
