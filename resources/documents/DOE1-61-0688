The paper describes anew ultrasound test system for thick-walled components (PAG-ALOK method)and for pipings (RL system), X-ray testing using a scraper, a devicegeneration for testing steam generator heating tubes, and a transit timereconstruction and data representation in finite-element networks usedin nozzle edge testing.</TEXT></DOC>
