But Japanese companies plan to boost their output in thequarter, and thus could be positioned to gain market share ifsales recover later in the year.</LP><TEXT>   The 10 companies that build cars in the U.S. plan to make1,491,867 cars in the second quarter, industry officials say.That would mark a 14.7% decline from last year's total, andsink U.S. car production to its lowest second-quarter levelin 33 years.   However, the drop mostly reflects cuts by General MotorsCorp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. Japanese-owned oroperated factories plan to build 353,972 cars in the quarter,up 8.5% from a year ago. Japanese-run factories are expectedto build 23.7% of the cars assembled in the U.S. during thecurrent quarter, up from 18.7% a year ago.   Through the end of April, Japanese companies had a 30%share of total U.S. domestic and imported car sales, up from27% a year earlier. The latest production plans indicate thatthe major Japanese auto makers expect their sales and shareto keep improving.   However, an end to the overall auto recession isn't insight. &quot;The outlook hasn't changed much,&quot; said Ted Sullivan,an industry analyst with Wefa Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. TheBig Three set their bearish April-to-June production plansearlier this year with the assumption that they could addmore production if car sales surged this quarter, Mr.Sullivan explained. But no such recovery has materialized.Sales of domestic cars in early May fell to a seasonallyadjusted annual pace of 5.4 million vehicles, little betterthan the sickly 5.3 million rate in late April.   Thus, &quot;The Big Three will all be in the red in the secondquarter,&quot; said auto analyst David Healy. But Mr. Healyforecasts their total operating losses will narrow to about$1 billion, compared with $2.32 billion in the first quarter.This reflects the fact that this quarter's U.S. carproduction will be 13.8% higher than the first-quarter level.   Moreover, there's still some potential for improvement.Auto makers aren't saddled with big stocks of unsoldvehicles. There was a 71-day supply of cars on dealer lots atthe end of April, a tally much closer to the optimum level ofa 65-day supply. By contrast, there was a 92-day supply ofcars at the beginning of the first quarter, according toindustry trade Journal Ward's Reports.   The low inventories have resulted in some small increasesin second-quarter production schedules from levels called forearlier in the year. Since April, GM has added 6,500 cars and7,500 trucks to its plans for the current quarter. But that'sa boost of only 1.4% to its overall production, and GM stillexpects to build 23.1% fewer cars in the second quarter thana year ago.   Ford added 8,000 cars to its plans since early April. Butthat production increase is based on increased orders fromrental-car agencies, not stronger consumer demand. Ford plansto build 3.8% fewer cars in the U.S. during the currentquarter than a year ago.   Chrysler's car-production schedules registered the biggestpercentage declines in the quarter, dropping by 37.6%.Chrysler's truck-production schedules are expected to slip byjust 1.9% from a year ago, reflecting relatively strong salesof its minivans. Chrysler now plans to run both its minivanfactories on full overtime from now until the end of 1991model production in July.   Overall, auto makers are keeping a tight rein on theirpickup, van and sportutility vehicle production schedules,industry insiders say. U.S. auto makers plan to build 923,224light trucks in the current quarter, down 14.6% from a yearago. The current plans represent a scant 1.7% boost fromsecond-quarter schedules reported last month.   ---                                                                                                                                   CARS                                                                                                                                    1991       1990     %Chg.
