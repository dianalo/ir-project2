The value of the proposed transaction hasn't yet been determined. REPH said the offer calls for its other shareholders to receive stock in Pesch's Alpha Health Systems Corp. unit, which already controls 64% of REPH. The board of REPH has appointed a special committee to negotiate terms of the proposal, the company said.    REPH last year acquired Republic Health Corp., Dallas, in a $406.2 million leveraged buyout led by LeRoy A. Pesch. Dr. Pesch, a Chicago physician, controls Pesch andamp; Co., a closely held health care and investment concern.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt ultimately is paid through the acquired company's operations or sale of assets.    Dr. Pesch said yesterday that the proposed transaction would further his plans to build an international health-care network and will create &quot;a much stronger operating company.&quot;    Last month, Pesch andamp; Co. offered $22 a share in cash and securities, or an indicated $1.91 billion, for American Medical International Inc., a Beverly Hills, Calif.-based hospital chain. American Medical rejected Pesch's initial bid of $20 a share cash.    But the REPH transaction clearly would give REPH's other holders -- including Republic Health's management, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. -- a direct stake in Pesch's bid for American Medical.    Pesch hasn't yet arranged financing for its American Medical bid. Dr. Pesch wouldn't comment on whether he plans to seek financial backing from the other REPH holders for the American Medical acquisition. &quot;We don't have an (investor) group that's clearly formed,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
