Eastmet is operating under Chapter ll of the federal Bankruptcy Code, which protects a company from creditor lawsuits while it develops a plan to pay debts.    Cyclops last December made an offer to Eastmet management for the stainless steel unit, but the offer was rejected, both companies said. Cyclops already produces stainless as well as carbon steel, and has nonresidential building operations.    Eastmet subsequently developed a plan of reorganization under which it would continue to operate the stainless business. However, the deadline for voting on that proposal was extended until March 10 to allow time for the Cyclops negotiations, said Paul Coughlin, Eastmet president and chief executive officer.    Mr. Coughlin said that Eastmet's management doesn't regard the Cyclops negotiations as hostile, and that creditors and the bankruptcy court will eventually decide between the Eastmet management plan and any reorganization plan incorporating an offer from Cyclops.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Cyclops shares closed up $1.625, at $26.    Eastmet also operates two foundries, a molded plastics business and a steel fabricating company, but Cyclops said it isn't interested in acquiring those units. Eastmet sales in the first nine months of 1987 were about $87 million, with about 85% of that coming from Eastern Stainless. Eastmet hasn't posted full-year results.    Eastmet's assets total about $72 million, and its liabilities are about $122 million, Mr. Coughlin said. </TEXT></DOC>
