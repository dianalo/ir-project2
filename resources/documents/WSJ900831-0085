Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/31/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><GV>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   LOS ANGELES -- Budget crunches and sinking morale aredoing what Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd never could:undermining the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   Long viewed as the nation's premier police force, the FBItoday lacks the money, manpower and technical resources tohandle its expanding and ever-more-complex workload. Alwaysselective about what cases it has taken, the agency nowconcedes that it ignores major crimes squarely within itsjurisdiction.</LP><TEXT>   Lawrence Lawler, special agent in charge here, says hedoesn't have enough agents to investigate savings-and-loanfraud allegations involving losses of less than $250,000.&quot;That's thousands of cases we aren't dealing with,&quot; he says.The 525-agent office is investigating only five of the scoresof telemarketing operations in Los Angeles suspected ofselling bogus precious metals and real estate. Localauthorities investigate a few more; the rest &quot;operateunfettered,&quot; Mr. Lawler says.   Special Agent Kevin Kelly is using pencil, paper and acalculator to try to untangle the convoluted paper trail of asuspected $55 million money-laundering operation; there is acomputer terminal, but he has to share it with 13 otheragents. In San Francisco, where immigrants from Vietnam andother Asian countries have formed violent new crimesyndicates, the FBI office doesn't have a single agent whospeaks Vietnamese to monitor wiretaps or do undercover work.   In Newark, N.J., rows of empty steno-pool desks signifydozens of secretarial positions unfilled because the FBIdoesn't pay enough to attract local high school graduates.Agents do their own typing at the sacrifice of &quot;street time.&quot;   Things may get worse. An anticipated wave of retirementsand resignations over the next five years could strip the FBIof half of its most experienced agents. Many are taking earlyretirement at age 50. Another &quot;huge wave of guys are about toquit&quot; well short of retirement eligibility because of salarycomplaints, warns Larry Langberg, president of the FBI AgentsAssociation, a private advocacy group.   Until the past decade, FBI pay exceeded that of most localpolice. Today, though, federal agents in Los Angeles make$5,000 to $13,000 a year less than local officers withcomparable credentials. Similar disparities exist in othercities, including Boston, Chicago, Newark and San Francisco.(Agents in New York City -- but nowhere else -- receiveannual cost-of-living bonuses.)   FBI officials in Washington talk optimistically aboutproposed legislation that would improve the starting salaryof $27,000 a year and extend the New York bonus program toother cities. But morale among street agents has alreadyslumped, says Gary Lisotto, the No. 2 man in the Los Angelesoffice. For his part, Mr. Lisotto, 48 years old, says he willstay long enough to qualify for a pension -- less than twoyears -- &quot;and then I'm gone.&quot;   The ability of the bureau's 9,800 agents, to be sure, isstill unsurpassed in many areas. Years of painstakingundercover work, for example, have paid off recently withscores of convictions of major mob figures.   But overall, the FBI's reputation for sophistication andself-confidence is eroding, senior agents themselves concede.One reason is that the reputation has always been basedpartly on myth. J. Edgar Hoover, the agency's director for 48years, favored targets that generated impressive statistics,such as bank robberies and car thefts. He eschewed messynarcotics cases and, until shortly before his death in 1972,didn't even acknowledge the existence of organized crime.   The FBI thus &quot;appeared to be winning&quot; whatever Mr. Hooverdefined as its &quot;war on crime,&quot; says James Fyfe, acriminologist at American University in Washington.   Without the master image crafter in charge, the FBI'sresponsibilities have exploded, while its budget, viewed ininflation-adjusted dollars, has grown only moderately, toabout $1.5 billion a year.   The bureau has brought some of the additional work onitself. It lobbied hard in the early 1980s for a role in thewidening federal &quot;war on drugs.&quot; Congress authorized thebureau to participate but didn't provide money for most ofthe additional agents the FBI expected. Currently, the bureaureceives funding for about 600 drug agents but actually has1,200 on the job. The difference is made up by transferringpeople from other areas, which necessarily suffer.   In Los Angeles, the bank-robbery squad has shrunk to 14agents from 40 over the past three years, while the number ofbank hits is expected to rise to 1,700 this year from 1,300three years ago. It now takes, on average, seven robberiesbefore the squad can identify a holdup man they haven't seenpreviously, says Mark Llewellyn, the unit's supervisor. Threeyears ago, when there were more agents to chase down leads,it took three or four robberies.   While drugs have absorbed more manpower, financial crimeswithin the FBI's purview have grown in number and complexity-- to the point where they baffle many agents. Years ago, abank case entailed &quot;$1,000 missing from a teller's cage,&quot;recalls Dick Held, chief of the bureau's San Franciscooffice. Today, he says, agents and supervisors struggle tounderstand the real-estate schemes and insider loans at theheart of many bank and thrift failures.   &quot;We simply don't have the experienced agents to put onthese cases,&quot; agrees Mr. Lawler of the Los Angeles office.Low salaries make it hard to recruit experienced accountants,who can earn twice as much working for a private firm. Foragents, most training for white-collar crime work comeshaphazardly on the job.   The bureau's lack of expertise in financial-fraudinvestigations helps dictate its strategy in Sandamp;L cases:seeking indictments based on a few isolated transactions,rather than trying to prove larger conspiracies. &quot;We putblinders on {and} . . . stop with the first case {we} canmake,&quot; says Mr. Lawler's deputy, Mr. Lisotto.   Even in the area of criminal identification -- once an FBIspecialty -- the bureau now finds itself behind the times.The FBI's legendary fingerprint files are only partlyautomated as a result of slashes in technical budgets to payfor more agents. The optical-scanning equipment the bureaudoes have dates to the mid-'70s. In most cases, arduousmatching done by hand causes delays of four to six weeks inidentifying prints taken from a crime scene. By that time,many crooks are long gone, says Sue Schnitzer, supervisor forviolent crimes in the bureau's San Francisco office.   Several states, led by California, have more sophisticatedsystems, allowing fingerprint matches to be made by computersin hours, not weeks. Says Dennis Kurre, chief of the FBI'sIdentification Division: &quot;We are no longer state-of-the-art.&quot;   ---                           Payday                                                                                                          For two members of a federal-local drug task force in LosAngeles:                                                                                                                                       FBI Special     Deputy                                      Agent*   Sheriff**                                                                                                          Biweekly Base Pay              $1,369.60    $1,724.00   Overtime                          252.00       598.19   Taxes and Deductions              348.11       551.68   Take-Home Pay                  $1,273.49    $1,770.51                                                                                                          *Law school graduate with 10 years of law-enforcementexperience.
