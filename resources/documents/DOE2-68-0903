One argument in favor of suchinvolvement is that the utilities are the entity most aware of the truecosts of the backup energy demanded by solar and the true benefits ofenergy saved by solar. For example, one estimate is that each new homethat uses electricity in peak periods requires $10,000 investment inpeaking capacity, and utilities could thus use such data to formulatepolicies to encourage installing such capacity via solar energy providedthat an equivalent capacity would cost the utility less than $10,000.In addition, the fact of utility involvement itself has advantages tothe commercialization of solar systems: utilites could buy solar equipmentin quantity, enabling rationalization of the solar industry, standardizationof mass production, and ensuring of quality and performance. Becauseof their bill-collecting ability, utilities could finance solar investmentseasily and spread the cost over many customers. Arguments against utilityinvolvement include the possibility that utilities might create an undesirablemonopoly in the solar industry, stifle innovation, bring about prematureadoption of inferior technology, and squeeze out competitors. A middleposition is suggested in which the utility could lend money for solarpurchases to ensure that backup power is not used during peak periods.</TEXT></DOC>
