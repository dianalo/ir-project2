The Mavericksare 7-9, fifth in the Midwest Division.; WARRIORS UPDATE: With Utah out of theway, the Warriors are looking at the next six games of this homestand as anexcellent opportunity to take control of the Pacific Division. The combinedrecord of the next six opponents is 39-56. Coach Don Nelson also is lookingfor a player to step up and take over the center position. Alton Lister didthat for 29 minutes Tuesday, scoring 15 points and grabbing nine rebounds, buthe had to sit out Wednesday's practice because of his recurring groinproblems. Rookie Victor Alexander has eaten his way out of the starting lineupby allowing his weight to balloon to 280 pounds. Tyrone Hill probably is theman for now, but he had no points and just two rebounds in 11 minutesTuesday.; MAVERICKS UPDATE: The Mavericks are a guard-driven team these days,led by Rolando Blackman, Derek Harper and Fat Lever. But the inside playleaves something to be desired. For evidence of that, look no further than the31-point, 29-rebound effort by Atlanta's Kevin Willis on Tuesday. Blackman,the team's leading scorer at 20.9 points per game, was back in the lineupTuesday after missing two games because of a sore knee, but scored only ninepoints.; KEY INJURIES: Warriors -- Lister (groin) is probable. F Chris Gatling(left ankle and shoulder sprain) is on the injured list. Mavericks -- Blackman(knee) is expected to play.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  -- John Akers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911205  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  267  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 5, 199100340191,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
