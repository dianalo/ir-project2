The housing report by the Commerce Department was likely tointensify fears that the economy is in danger of toppling into anew recession. Housing, because it is so sensitive to risinginterest rates, is often a harbinger of troubles in other sectorsof the economy.   The report said applications for building permits, a goodindicator of future activity, plunged by 13.7 percent in March, thebiggest monthly drop since a 14 percent decline in October 1981, inthe early stages of the last recession.   The 5.4 percent decline in construction of new homes andapartments was the second monthly decrease, following a 12 percentdrop in February. It left construction work at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 1.4 million units last month as work onboth single-family homes and apartment buildings weakened.   Construction of single-family homes dropped below the 1 millionmark to an annual rate of 994,000 units, the slowest pace sinceJanuary 1985.   Starts of multi-family units fell 8.8 percent to an annual rateof 403,000 units.   Econommists have blamed rising mortgage rates for the housingslowdown. Fixed-rate mortgages are now averaging 11.11 percent, upby almost one full percentaage point from a year ago, according toa national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   The Federal Reserve over the past year has been pushing interestrates higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures. ButPresident Bush and various members of Congress have expressed fearsthat the Fed may be in danger of overdoing the credit-tightening. Agrowing number of economists have started to predict that a newrecession is likely to begin by late this year or early in 1990.   The weakness in March was led by a steep 34.1 percent drop inconstruction activity in the Northeast, a region which untilrecently had been experiencing a building boom triggered byimproving fortunes of high-technology industries in the area.   But in March, Northeast construction starts fell to an annualrate of 149,000 units, the slowest building pace in the regionsince September 1983.   Starts of new homes and apartments were off 5.2 percent in theSouth, dropping to an annual rate of 546,000 units while starts inthe West dropped by 1 percent to a rate of 395,000 units.   The Midwest was the only region of the country to enjoy anincrease in activity, with housing construction climbing by 10.4percent to an annual rate of 307,000 units.   The 13.7 percent decline in building permits in March followed a6.1 percent fall in February and left permits at an annual rate of1.22 million units, the slowest pace since October 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
