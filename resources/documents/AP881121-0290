The staggering takeover maneuvers for the food-and-tobacco giantgrew even more complex Sunday when a special committee of directorsevaluating offers said it was postponing the deadline for biddersuntil Nov. 29.   The committee also disclosed that the bids received as of thefirst deadline last Friday not only topped all previous bids, whichwere in the unprecedented $90-a-share or $20 billion range, but thatall were worth at least $94 a share or about $21.3 billion. Thecommittee said one group had estimated its offer as possibly worthup to $118 a share or $26.6 billion.   It further stated all previous bidders could resubmit offers,strongly suggesting the committee wasn't satisfied with proposalsreceived so far. The committee also told its own advisers toconsider other types of restructuring.   ``...while no assurance can be given that any transaction willoccur, the Special Committee expressed its belief that that processwhich it is overseeing will benefit all shareholders,'' statedCharles Hugel, RJR Nabisco's chairman and the head of thefive-member special committee.   RJR's stock jumped $2.37{ to $86.37{ on the New York StockExchange, where it was the most heavily traded stock of the morningwith more than 1.44 million shares changing owners.   Jostling for approval now are these proposals:   _A $100-a-share cash and securities offer valued at about $22.5billion from a group led by RJR Nabisco senior management and theinvestment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon BrothersInc. That group, which last month touched off the buyout battle witha proposed takeover, previously offered $92 a share, or about $20.7billion, for RJR's 225.3 million common shares outstanding.   _A $94-a-share cash and securities offer, with an indicated valueof about $21.2 billion by a group led by buyout specialist KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co., which previously offered $90 a share, or about$20.3 billion.   _A preliminary cash and securities proposal to sell RJR's foodbusinesses and later acquire its tobacco business separately, from agroup led by the investment firm First Boston Corp. and apartnership that includes Chicago's Pritzker family and Denverbillionaire Philip Anschutz. First Boston indicated it valued thetotal consideration at from $105 to $118 a share.   All three proposals would include a minority equity stake in thepost-buyout company for current RJR shareholders.   ``Due to the varying potential values and nature of theconsideration offered in the two bids and the proposal, and thevarying terms, conditions and contingencies associated with each,the Special Committee determined not to make any recommendation atthis time'' Hugel stated.   Atlanta-based RJR makes hundreds of consumer items ranging fromJose Cuervo tequila and Salem cigarettes to Life Savers candy andMilk Bone dog snacks.   Any of the latest proposals easily would be the biggest U.S.merger ever, topping the record $13.4 billion acquisition of GulfOil Corp. by what is now Chevron Corp. in 1984.   It was not immediately clear whether the bidders were ready toescalate the already tense takeover fight.   Kohlberg Kravis stated its group ``must carefully consider ouralternatives in light of new information we will be receiving beforereaching any judgment on what further steps, if any, we might take.''   F. Ross Johnson, RJR's chief executive and the leader of themanagement group, said he believed his group had submitted ``awinning bid,'' but gave no indication whether its proposal wassubject to revision.   There was no comment from the First Boston-led group.   The management group offered $100 a share in cash for for 175million of the company's 225.3 million outstanding common shares.The group said it would acquire the remaining shares for $56 cash,plus securities and common stock in the surviving company that itsaid would bring the total consideration to $100 a share. The commonstock would equal about 15 percent of the surviving company'soutstanding shares.   The new Kohlberg Kravis proposal would pay $94 cash a share forabout 178 million RJR Nabisco shares. The remaining stock would beexchanged for preferred stock and securities the firm valued at $94a share, including convertible debentures that, assuming fullconversion into stock, would amount to about 25 percent of thepost-buyout company's outstanding shares.   The Kohlberg and management group's offers are for a leveragedbuyout, in which most of the money for the purchase of RJR Nabiscowould be borrowed and later repaid with the comapny's cash flow orthe sale of its assets.   The First Boston group's preliminary proposal includes theinstallment sale by Dec. 31 of RJR's food businesses _ whichaccounted for about 60 percent of net sales last year, or $15.8billion _ followed by the acquisition next year of the tobaccooperations.   The plan anticipates a purchase of the RJR tobacco business for$15.75 billion plus the stock warrants, and the sale of the foodbusinesses for a $13 billion installment note plus the right to 80percent of the total net proceeds from the sale of food businessesthat exceeded the amount of the note.   Proceeds from the sale of the food operations, which analystshave estimated could total $12.5 billion to $15.5 billion, would goto shareholders. First Boston indicated the total considerationcould range from $98 to $110 cash a share, plus securities and stockwarrants firm valued at from $7 to $8 a share. The warrants wouldentitle RJR shareholders to acquire up to 20 percent of the tobaccobusiness.</TEXT></DOC>
