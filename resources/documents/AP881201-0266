Wall Street saw the giant charge as a sign that ATandamp;T was movingaggressively to cut costs and install a new digital network to meetthe competition. The stock was fairly stable, falling 50 cents to$29.37{ a share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.   The charge will not affect ATandamp;T's cash flow, its ability to paydividends or the money available for investment.   ``This reflects the adjustment of going from a regulatedmarketplace to a competitive marketplace,'' said Robert Morris III,a San Francisco-based analyst for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   ATandamp;T said the charge would reduce its after-tax profits by $3.9billion. That makes it likely that the company will lose about $1.6billion in all of 1988 and $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter alone.   The only larger quarterly losses in U.S. history were ATandamp;T's own$4.87 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1983, which involved acharge to prepare for the Bell System breakup, and Texaco Inc.'s$4.76 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1987 stemming from itslegal fight with Pennzoil Co.   Long-distance phone companies have been moving aggressively toreplace their old-fashioned analog equipment with new digitalequipment that provides higher quality and is better suited tocustom services and transmission of computer data.   The bulk of the charge, $5.0 billion, is to reflect on the booksthe lower value of outdated analog network equipment. The remaining$1.7 billion is for the costs of removing the outdated equipment,writedowns in the value of related equipment, and reductions inemployment.   ATandamp;T said it would reduce the number of its network employees by10,000 and the number of its operators by 6,000 over the next fewyears.   ATandamp;T does not yet know how many of the employees will be givenjobs elsewhere in the company because that depends on the company'sgrowth, spokeswoman LuAnn Gardner said.   The Communications Workers of America, the union representing135,000 ATandamp;T workers, issued a statement saying non-managementemployees have suffered the loss of 78,500 jobs since 1984 whilemanagement ranks have risen by 13,600.   ``This company just has not bitten the bullet _ it has not comeout of its `monopoly cocoon' levels of management,'' the union said.   ATandamp;T spokesman Burke Stinson responded that the company had tohire white-collar workers because of its new thrusts into computersand foreign markets. But he said ``we're not blind to the fact''that staff jobs need to be cut.   ATandamp;T has a freeze on hiring over most of the company. That givesthe displaced employees a better chance to find work elsewherewithin the company than if they had to face competition from newhires.   Plans to reduce 3,000 of the network jobs and all 6,000 of theoperator service jobs had already been announced to employees, ATandamp;Tsaid. The company is setting aside $400 million to cover the cost ofredeploying them or giving them payments or incentives related toseparation from the company by retirement or resignation.   The job cuts are possible because improvements in the networkreduce the need for maintenance, engineering, service, orderprocessing and call handling. Operators at new stations are able tohandle 25 percent more calls per hour, the company said.   ATandamp;T has switched over to a digital network far more rapidly thanit had previously planned.   The company predicted early in 1987 that it would take until theyear 2010 to have an all-digital network. By the end of 1987 it saidit could do the job by 1991. On Thursday, it said it could do thejob by the end of next year.   MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., theNo. 2 and No. 3 competitors in long distance, have also movedrapidly to put in digital networks and have taken big charges towrite down the book value of their outdated analog equipment.   Executives of ATandamp;T had said in October that writedowns in thefourth quarter could be substantial. By taking the pain of thewritedown all at once, ATandamp;T no longer has to lower its quarterlyprofits to reflect the costs of depreciating the older equipment.   ``We view this as very positive news,'' Ms. Gardner said. ``Ournetwork will continue to be the best out there.''   ATandamp;T took a $10 billion pre-tax charge at the end of 1983 toprepare for the divestiture of its local telephone companies. Italso took pre-tax charges of $200 million in 1985 and $3.2 billionat the end of 1986.   ATandamp;T has reduced employment by 64,000 since the breakup of theBell System on Jan. 1, 1984. It has about 310,000 employees now, andthat could drop to below 300,000 over the next three to five years,Ms. Gardner said.   As large as the job cuts are, securities analysts said they couldbe even larger.   ``They have grossly too many people. At the time of divestiture,a lot of people were unloaded onto them,'' said James McCabe, ananalyst at Nomura Securities International Inc. He said the cutshave occurred gradually because ``they're a very humane employer.''   The Communications Workers of America said ATandamp;T had originallyindicated it had a surplus of 12,000 to 14,000 operators, and thatthe union bargained the company down to 6,000.   Stinson said the thrust of the statement was correct but ATandamp;Tcould not confirm the union's numbers.</TEXT></DOC>
