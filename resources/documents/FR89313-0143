A transcript of that meeting isavailable from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities at the addressgiven above. In accordance with Section IV-C-1-b of the NIH Guidelines, these actionshave been found to comply with the NIH Guidelines and to present no significantrisk to health or to the environment. Part I of this announcement provides background information and decisionson the actions under the NIH Guidelines. Part II provides a summary ofthe actions. Part III provides a correction to a notice published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 26, 1988 (53 FR 43410).<ITAG tagnum="85">I. Background Information and Decisions on Actions Under the NIH Guidelines</ITAG>A.Human Gene Transfer ProposalThree National Institutes of Health (NIH) intramural scientists, Dr. W.French Anderson, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and Drs. R.Michael Blaese and Steven A. Rosenberg, National Cancer Institute, havesubmitted a proposal involving transfer of a bacterial gene coding forneomycin phosphotransferase into the cells of human patients. The geneis to be used as a marker to trace the path of ``tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,''or TIL, administered as part of an ongoing experimental cancer treatment.The proposal was first received in June and July 1988, by a number of internalNIH review committees charged with oversight of the safety of proposedexperiments. Concern for safety extends from the patients to the healthcare personnel and the researchers. The institutional review boards ofthe two sponsoring institutes and the NIH Institutional Biosafety Committee(IBC) all gave ``conditional approval'' with certain stipulations. Amongthese stipulations was a requirement that the Recombinant DNA AdvisoryCommittee (RAC) grant its approval of the same procedure.On July 29, 1988, the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee of the RecombinantDNA Advisory Committee met to consider the gene transfer proposal and deferredapproval pending receipt of additional data. This public meeting was announcedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23805). The Subcommitteeprovided specific questions to be answered by the investigators prior tothe October 3, 1988, RAC meeting. During a telephone conference on September 29, 1988, the Subcommittee membersand consultants participating in the conference decided unanimously todefer approval of the proposal because the questions posed at the July29, 1988, meeting had not yet been answered by the additional data whichhad been provided. The October 3, 1988, public meeting of the RAC was announced in the September2, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 34246). At this meeting, the RAC receivedand discussed data not made available previously to the Human Gene TherapySubcommittee. Based on these data, the RAC recommended that NIH approvethis protocol by a vote of 16 in favor, 5 opposed, and no abstentions.In addition to the RAC review, I requested that the entire protocol, includingdata presented at the October 3, 1988, meeting and any additional dataobtained since that date, be reviewed by the Subcommittee at its December9, 1988, public meeting (53 FR 45591). This request was duly carried out, and the Human Gene Therapy Subcommitteevoted unanimously to approve the protocol by a vote of 12 in favor, noneopposed, and no abstentions.Following that meeting, the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities sent amail ballot to RAC members, including the motion approved by the Subcommitteeand the minutes of the December 9, 1988, meeting of the Human Gene TherapySubcommittee. The results of the ballot were 21 in favor, none opposed,3 abstentions.<ITAG tagnum="21">The motion approved by the Subcommittee and the RAC is as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To approve the human gene transfer proposal submitted by Drs. Anderson,Blaese, and Rosenberg with the following stipulations:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. There will be no more than 10 patients in the initial trial;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The patients selected will have a life expectancy of about 90 days;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The patients give fully informed consent to participate in thetrial; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The investigators will provide additional data before expandingthe trial by adding patients or by inserting a gene for therapeutic purposes.</ITAG>Points 1 through 3 of the motion were adopted by the RAC at the October3, 1988, meeting. Point 4 of the motion was added by the Subcommittee onDecember 9, 1988, making explicit a policy that had been agreed upon atthe October 3, 1988, RAC meeting.Approval to implement this proposal has now been recommended by: The ClinicalResearch Subpanels of both sponsoring institutes, the NIH InstitutionalBiosafety Committee, the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC),the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee of the RAC, and the Food and Drug AdministrationVaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee.Through data obtained in animal experiments, the investigators have demonstratedto the satisfaction of the above review committees that the use of amphotropicallypackaged retroviral vectors does not pose a public health risk to patientsor to health care personnel, even in the event of accidential exposureto experimental material. Therefore, I have determined that this protocoldoes not present a risk to public health or to the environment.After reviewing the relevent records and documentation, I accepted thisrecommendation, and approval to conduct this experiment has been givento Drs. Anderson, Blaese, and Roseberg.B. Amendment of Section I-C of the NIH GuidelinesSection I-C of the NIH Guidelines currently reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Guidelines are applicable to all recombinant DNA research withinthe United States or its territories which is conducted at or sponsoredby an institution that receives any support for recombinant DNA researchfrom the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This includes research performedby the NIH directly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An individual receiving support for research involving recombinantDNA must be associated with or sponsored by an institution that can anddoes assume the responsibilities assigned in these Guidelines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Guidelines are also applicable to projects done abroad if theyare suported by NIH funds. If the host counrty, however, has establishedrules for the conduct of recombinant DNA projects, then a certificate ofcompliance with those rules may be submitted to NIH in lieu of compliancewith the NIH Guidelines. The NIH reserves the right to withhold fundingif the safety practices to be employed abroad are not reasonably consistentwith the NIH Guidelines.</ITAG>In a letter date January 9, 1987, Mr. Edward Lee Rogers, Counsel for theFoundation on Economic Trends, and Mr. Jeremy Rifkin, Foundation on EconomicTrends, Washington, DC, proposed that the following text be inserted afterthe first sentence of the third paragraph of section I-C:<ITAG tagnum="21">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term `project' includesany research or development of the recombinant organism or other productor process in question, including all such work that is reasonably foreseeablewhen the NIH support is received. NIH support includes both money grantsand any type of in-kind support, including research conducted directlyby NIH, supplies, equipment, the use of facilities, and biological researchmaterials. NIH support has been given where the source of funds or in-kindsupport is, directly or indirectly, the NIH.</ITAG>This proposed amendment of section I-C was initially published for commentin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 11, 1987 (52 FR 7525), prior to a scheduledRAC meeting on June 15, 1987. The June 15, 1987, meeting was postponedand rescheduled on September 21, 1987. Accordingly, this proposed amendmentwas published again for comment in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 11, 1987 (52 FR 29800). After extensive discussion at its meeting on September 21, 1987, the RACvoted to establish a working group to make recommendations regarding internationalprojects and to report back to the full RAC. A Working Group on International Projects met at the NIH on February 1,1988 (53 FR 808). After much discussion, the working group voted sevenin favor, none opposed, and no abstentions that the following proposedrevision of the last paragraph of Section I-C be published for comment:<ITAG tagnum="21">The NIH Guidelines are also applicable: (1) To projects done abroadif they are supported by NIH funds, or (2) to research done abroad if itinvolves deliberate release into the environment or testing in humans ofmaterials containing recombinant DNA developed with NIH funds and the researchis a direct extension of the development process. If the host country,however, has established rules for the conduct of recombinant DNA projects,then a written assurance of compliance with those rules may be submittedto NIH in lieu of compliance with the NIH Guidelines. Alternatively, ifthe host country does not have such rules, written acceptance by an appropriategovernment office of the host country is necessary in lieu of compliancewith the NIH Guidelines. The NIH reserves the right to withhold fundingif the safety practices to be employed abroad are not reasonably consistentwith the NIH Guidelines. </ITAG>After extensive discussion of this proposed amendment of Section I-C andattempts to draft revised language, the RAC recommended that the many issuesraised be referred back to the working group for further consideration.A Working Group on International Projects met at the NIH on August 15,1988 (53 FR 27570). The working group recommended that the following proposedrevision of the last paragraph of Section I-C be published for comment:<ITAG tagnum="21">The NIH Guidelines are also applicable to recombinant DNA projectsdone abroad: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. If they are supported by NIH funds; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. If they involve deliberate release into the environment or testingin humans of materials containing recombinant DNA developed with NIH funds,and if the institution that developed those materials sponsors or participatesin those projects. Participation includes research collaboration or contracturalagreements, but not mere provison of research materials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If the host country has established rules for the conduct of recombinantDNA projects, then the project must be in compliance with those rules.If the host country does not have such rules, the proposed project mustbe reviewed by an NIH-approved IBC or equivalent review body and acceptedin writing by an appropriate national governmental authority. The safetypractices to be employed abroad must be reasonably consistent with theNIH Guidelines.</ITAG>The proposed language was published for public comment in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 2, 1988 (53 FR 34246). No commentswere received in response to the notice. This language was reviewed atthe October 3, 1988, RAC meeting and accepted with one modification. Afterthe word ``authority'' in the final paragraph, the phrase ``of the hostcountry'' was added. This motion passed unanimously by a vote of 20 infavor, none opposed, and no abstentions. I accept these recommendations, and Section I-C has been amended accordingly.C. Proposed Amendment of Section I-BRAC member, Dr. Anne Vidaver of the University of Nebraska, proposed thatthe following paragraph regarding transposons be added to Section I-B,Definition of Recombinant DNA Molecules:<ITAG tagnum="21">Unmodified transposons (wild-type) that become inserted into a genome,even if carried by a recombinant vector or plasmid, are not subject tothese guidelines. For example, it is common to use vectors that eitherare naturally unstable (suicide vector) in a desired host or that can berendered unstable by manipulating physiological conditions. In the processof suicide (inability of the vector to replicate), transposon transfermay occur. This process is not considered recombinant DNA.</ITAG>Transposable genetic elements or transposons are mobile DNA segments thatcan insert into a few or several sites in a genome. Such insertions, unlikeclassical recombination events, do not require DNA sequence homology andare independent of recombination systems. Many transposons have been discoveredin microorganisms and other organisms. They may be insertion sequencesthat do not carry genes related to a phenotype such as drug resistance,lactose or raffinose utilization, arginine biosynthesis, mercury resistance,or enterotoxin production. Transposable elements also include self-replicatingelements such as the entire bacteriophage genomes of Mu and Psi.This proposal appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 2, 1988 (53 FR 34246), for publiccomment. Two suggestions for modifying the proposed language were receivedand discussed at the October 3, 1988, RAC meeting.A substitute motion was developed as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Genomic DNA of plants and bacteria that has acquired a transposableelement, even if the latter was donated from a recombinant vector no longerpresent, is not subject to these Guidelines unless the transposon itselfcontains recombinant DNA.</ITAG>The motion to recommend approval of this modification to Section I-B ofthe Guidelines was passed by a vote of 18 in favor, none opposed, and noabstentions.I accept this recommendation, and Section I-B of the Guidelines is amendedaccordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Actions</ITAG>A. Human Gene Transfer ProposalThe following section is added to Appendix D:<ITAG tagnum="21">Appendix D-XIII</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Drs. W. French Anderson, R. Michael Blaese, and Steven Rosenberg ofthe National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, can conduct experimentsin which a bacterial gene coding for neomycin phosphotransferase will beinserted into a portion of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) ofcancer patients using a retroviral vector, N2. The marked TIL then willbe combined with unmarked TIL, and reinfused into the patients. This experimentis an addition to an ongoing adoptive immunotherapy protocol in which TILare isolated from a patient's tumor, grown in culture in the presence ofinterleukin-2, and reinfused into the patient. The marker gene will beused to detect TIL at various time intervals following reinfusion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approval is based on the following four stipulations:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. There will be no more than 10 patients in the initial trial;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The patients selected will have a life expectancy of about 90 days;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The patients give fully informed consent to participate in thetrial; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The investigators will provide additional data before expandingthe trial by adding patients or by inserting a gene for therapeutic purposes.</ITAG>B. Amendment of Section I-C of the NIH GuidelinesSection I-C of the Guidelines is modified to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Guidelines are applicable to all recombinant DNA research withinthe United States or its territories which is conducted at or sponsoredby an institution that receives any support for recombinant DNA researchfrom the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The safety practices to be employed abroad must be reasonablyconsistent with the NIH Guidelines.</ITAG>C. Proposed Amendment of Section I-BSection I-B is modified to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">In the context of these Guidelines recombinant DNA molecules are definedas either (i) molecules which are constructed outside living cells by joiningnatural or synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate ina living cell, or (ii) DNA molecules that result from the replication ofthose described in (i) above.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Synthetic DNA segments likely to yield a potentially harmful polynucleotideor polypeptide (e.g., a toxin or a pharmacologically active agent) shallbe considered as equivalent to their natural DNA counterpart. If the syntheticDNA segment is not expressed in vivo as a biologically active polynucleotideor polypeptide product, it is exempt from the Guidelines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Genomic DNA of plants and bacteria that has acquired a transposableelement, even if the latter was donated from a recombinant vector no longerpresent, is not subject to these Guidelines unless the transposon itselfcontains recombinant DNA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">III. Correction to Notice of Actions Published in the Federal Registeron October 26, 1988 (53 FR 43410)</ITAG>Two phrases were inadvertently dropped from <T3>Part II., D. Revision of Appendix C-IV. </T3>Appendix C-IV should readas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Any asporogenic Bacillus subtilis or asporogenic Bacillus licheniformisstrain which does not revert to a sporeformer with a frequency greaterthan 10, can be used for cloning DNA with the exception of those experimentslisted below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For these exempt laboratory experiments, BL1 physical containmentconditions are recommended.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For large-scale (LS) fermentation experiments, the appropriate physicalcontainment conditions need be no greater than those for the host organismunmodified by recombinant DNA techniques; the IBC can specify higher containmentif it deems necessary.</ITAG>OMB's ``Mandatory Information Requirements for Federal Assistance ProgramAnnouncements''(45 FR 39592) requires a statement concerning the officialgovernment programs contained in the <T3>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. </T3>Normally NIH lists inits announcements the number and title of affected individual programsfor the guidance of the public. Because the guidance in this notice coversnot only virtually every NIH program but also essentially every Federalresearch program in which DNA recombinant molecule techniques could beused, it has been determined to be not cost effective or in the publicinterest to attempt to list these programs. Such a list would likely requireseveral additional pages. In addition, NIH could not be certain that everyFederal program would be included as many Federal agencies, as well asprivate organizations, both national and international, have elected tofollow the NIH Guidelines. In lieu of the individual program listing, NIHinvites readers to direct questions to the information address above aboutwhether individual programs listed in the <T3>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance </T3>are affected.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James B.
