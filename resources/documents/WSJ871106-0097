Kelley is close to pulling off the most lucrative compensation coup in BankAmerica Corp.'s long history.    Mr. Kelley, 44 years old, is chairman and chief executive officer of BA Investment Management Corp., a relatively small BankAmerica unit that manages equity and bond portfolios for clients such as pension funds and bond funds. In July, BankAmerica agreed to sell BA Investment to Monarch Capital Corp., Springfield, Mass., for $16.5 million.    According to a proxy statement filed by a client company of BA Investment, Mr. Kelley, who will continue to head the unit, will receive a total of $5.8 million in cash from both BankAmerica and Monarch if the transaction is completed. The payment comes from a profit-based incentive plan that BankAmerica wouldn't discuss in any detail. BankAmerica wouldn't divulge Mr. Kelley's annual salary.    Current and former BankAmerica officers, as well as compensation experts in the money-management business, expressed surprise at the riches Mr. Kelley may reap. When former Chairman and Chief Executive Samuel Armacost was deposed by the board last year, he left with a record golden parachute and stock options valued at a maximum of $1.5 million to $2.5 million, depending on certain factors and accounting for BankAmerica's lower stock price. But even the maximum value is only a fraction of Mr. Kelley's cash deal.    Other money-management firms say they have never heard of an executive for a publicly held money manager getting such a deal.&quot;It's the craziest thing I ever heard,&quot; says one consultant. &quot;I find that astounding,&quot; says a senior executive at one of the biggest asset-management firms. Adds a BankAmerica official who asked not to be identified: &quot;It's better than any sort of golden parachute that anybody around here has gotten lately.&quot;    Mr. Kelley declined repeated requests for an interview. In a prepared statement, BankAmerica would say only: &quot;The incentive plan was developed to attract top-caliber management to BA Investment. Payments paid under it are based on the performance of the company. The fact is that since Mr. Kelley joined BA Investment, its performance has improved dramatically. It has ranked in the top quartile of investment advisers based on investment results.&quot;    A bank spokesman added that BA Investment's profit has jumped more than tenfold since the incentive plan was adopted. But BankAmerica wouldn't say why profit rose, or say whether part of the increase resulted from an unusually depressed level of earlier earnings. The increase must have been from a small base, because BA Investment's balance sheets indicate the firm only earned about $1.3 million in both 1985 and 1986. Money managers say it is considered extraordinary for one manager of a publicly held adviser to receive incentive bonuses equal to 150% of a firm's total yearly net income.    Moreover, BA Investment's performance in investing in stocks and bonds for clients is considered mixed to good, but not extraordinary by rating services. And most of BA Investment's business is related to BankAmerica, rather than being due entirely to Mr. Kelley's management skills. Last year, 56% of its fees came from acting as adviser to BankAmerica affiliates and pension plans, and another 9% from advising a client company, Montgomery Street Income Securities Inc., of which Mr. Kelley is also chief executive.    According to banking officials, Mr. Kelley's incentive contract was negotiated on BankAmerica's behalf in 1985 by three executives at the parent. The contract awarded Mr. Kelley 76% of BA Investment's net income exceeding $175,000, although a small amount of that had to be shared with one other officer. The percentage after 1985 varied; it is expected to amount to 41% for 1987.    Other money managers and officials close to BankAmerica faulted the negotiating team for setting the threshold too low at $175,000, setting the percentage too high at 76% and limiting the incentives mostly to one manager: Mr. Kelley. An even bigger error, they assert, was giving Mr. Kelley an option to convert his payments to securities called &quot;phantom shares.&quot; Such shares represented equity in the firm in the event it was sold -- which it was in July.    In effect, the incentive contract made Mr. Kelley a very large shareholder in BA Investment, an unusual circumstance for a company owned by a publicly held concern such as BankAmerica. To settle his claims, BankAmerica's board agreed to pay him $2.9 million, and Monarch agreed to pay him $2.9 million over time &quot;in order to compensate Mr. Kelley for benefits under the plan which will otherwise be forgone by Mr. Kelley as a result of the sale and the termination of the plan,&quot; according to a Montgomery Street proxy.    Monarch's vice chairman, George Siguler, says Monarch feels that part of the $2.9 million it is paying Mr. Kelley is compensation for agreeing to a long-term employment contract. Monarch says it also plans to give Mr. Kelley an incentive contract -- but one more typical of industry practice.    BA Investment &quot;is a very nice little company that has done an extraordinarily good job as fiduciaries for its customers,&quot; says Mr. Siguler. &quot;Absent Mr. Kelley, BankAmerica had little business to sell.&quot;    However, the sale of BA Investment to Monarch, and Mr. Kelley's $5.8 million payment, aren't completely assured. The sale can be canceled, or the price reduced, if clients representing 20% or more of BA Investment's quarterly fee income decide to take their business elsewhere. Montgomery Street represents 9% of that fee income; at least two other investment advisory firms are underbidding BA Investment for the Montgomery Street contract.    Four of Montgomery Street's directors, including Mr. Kelley, are current or former BankAmerica officers. The board has asked its four independent directors to evaluate all of the offers, but it recommends that shareholders approve BA Investment as temporary adviser until a report is completed.    &quot;I believe the independent directors will be impartial in their review of my proposal,&quot; says the head of one of the competing firms. &quot;They have a fiduciary obligation to do so.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
