Such a transaction, which has been used by other investors to wring more profit out of smaller leveraged buy-out targets, would be the largest of its sort, Wall Street sources estimated. A big dividend at Beatrice could heat up the leveraged buy-out market by attracting more investors.    Typically, it takes investors five years to recoup their stake in a leveraged buyout, in which they finance an acquisition largely with debt and repay it mainly by selling assets. In April 1986, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York investment concern that led the investor group, took Beatrice private.    The value of Beatrice assets sold so far, about $8 billion, still doesn't equal the amount investors paid for the company. Donald P. Kelly, Beatrice's chairman, has auctioned off 10 major businesses, including the company's Coca-Cola bottlers and Tropicana juice lines, in an effort to break even.    However, the investors count themselves about $103 million ahead, from a special cash distribution last January and from their share of proceeds from the sale last March of units spun off as E-II Holdings Inc.    Neither Kohlberg Kravis nor Beatrice officials would confirm or deny that a dividend was likely. They have said they're exploring options to &quot;maximize shareholder value.&quot; A Beatrice filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month states that the company may &quot;modify its capital structure&quot; if allowed to do so by its lenders.    A spokesman for Bankers Trust Co., New York, the main lender in the Beatrice buy-out, declined to comment when asked whether Bankers Trust was negotiating new loan terms with Beatrice. The Chicago-based food and consumer products concern's current loan agreements prohibit dividends, one insider said.    A special dividend may help save Kohlberg Kravis from possible investor criticism that it overpaid for Beatrice. A year ago, some Beatrice insiders boasted that by selling off Beatrice's remaining major businesses -- its lines of Hunt tomato products, Wesson cooking oils and Swift meats -- the investors would earn a pre-tax profit that could exceed $3 billion.    But the stock market crash of Oct. 19 quickly slashed such profit estimates. More than 100 prospective buyers turned away from the last of Beatrice's assets, the most profitable of its businesses. At least one, Unilever N.V. of the Netherlands, is said by sources close to Beatrice to have made a bid that Mr. Kelly rejected as too low. Officials at Unilever, a food-products concern, wouldn't comment.    A dividend of $800 million, which apparently would be taxable, would enable Beatrice investors to about double their original investment. That's still a small ratio of success, compared with some leveraged buy-outs. For example, Weiss Peck andamp; Greer, a New York investment firm, recently sold its original $1 million stake in Chicago-based Aimcor Corp. to the industrial mineral company's managers for about $30 million, two years after acquiring it.    Beatrice investors who have heard about the possibility of a dividend said it may be the only way for them to realize a major profit. &quot;It's selling it to ourselves, or doing a releverage -- without the tax consequences,&quot; said one institutional investor.    For Beatrice, borrowing $800 million would raise its current debt level to about $4 billion, or roughly half the amount when Kohlberg Kravis bought it. Beatrice's $8.2 billion price included assumption of about $2 billion of existing debt.    Last month, Beatrice said it wasn't for sale any longer. Most prospective buyers wanted only part of the company. But Beatrice officials calculate that the tax liabilities on further piecemeal sales would roughly double, possibly to more than $800 million, over the amount that would be paid if the assets could be sold together.    Beatrice said last week that Mr. Kelly will resign as its chairman Oct. 1. He has long wanted to acquire part of the company as an acquisition vehicle to build a new conglomerate, but Beatrice's tax problems may doom such a transaction.    In acquiring Beatrice, Kohlberg Kravis led a group of numerous individual and institutional investors. Mr. Kelly, for example, who engineered the buy-out, owns 4.1 million of Beatrice's 134 million common shares, including those issuable under stock options.    As previously reported, Mr. Kelly's auction has apparently fizzled partly because of the $1.9 billion of intangible assets on the company's books. That so-called good will has accumulated largely from premium prices paid for certain Beatrice assets that have been acquired three times by various owners in under 10 years. U.S. tax laws make depreciation of such assets difficult for domestic companies.    ---    The Beatrice Buy-Out    April 1986 -- KKR investors invest $400 million and borrow $7.8 billion to take Beatrice Co. private in leveraged buy-out.*    April 1986-April 1988 -- Beatrice gradually sells off $8.0 billion of assets.**   May 1988 -- KKR investors estimate their pretax profit of$103 million, resulting from a special distribution of 57 cents a share and their proceeds from the sale of the spun off E-II Holdings Inc. to American Brands Inc. in March 1988.(The actual proceeds from Beatrice assets still don't exceed the amount paid for them.)    July 1988 -- Beatrice concedes it can't sell its Hunt tomato products, Wesson cooking oil and Swift meat businesses, which it hoped would fetch $2 billion.    August 1988 -- Sources say KKR considers borrowing to finance a restructuring that would pay Beatrice investors a dividend of as much as $800 million.    *Estimate based on Securities and Exchange Commission filings; includes assumption of debt.    **Estimated. </TEXT></DOC>
