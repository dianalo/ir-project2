(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former PTL aides charged with evading$487,000 in federal income taxes had several hundred thousanddollars more in questionable income the government did notchallenge, an Internal Revenue Service agent testified today.   IRS Agent Charles F. Mauney, an expert in tax-evasion cases,testified that David and James Taggart did not report more than$400,000 in taxable income for the years 1984 and 1985.   Mauney, who was questioned by government prosecutor David Brown,testified that the IRS did not challenge more than $320,000 in PTLpayments to the defendants for those years. The defendants are alsocharged with similar violations for the years 1986 and 1987 _ atopic expected to be taken up as Mauney's testimony continues.   ``There has been some testimony or documents in this trial whichpurport to account for some of these (payments),'' Mauney said.``The government decided not to challenge these items.   ``A lot of these items are questionable,'' he said. ``If I wasdoing a civil examination I would not allow them.''   The Taggarts, accused of taking more than $1 million in PTL moneyto bankroll their extravagant lifestyle, were fired by the TVministry following the resignation of PTL founder Jim Bakker.   Defense attorney Ben Cotten has not ruled out an appearance byBakker, who was the defendants' boss and close friend during theyears the Taggarts' were charged with evading $487,000 in incometaxes.   Bakker and Richard Dortch _ his former top deputy at thenow-bankrupt television ministry _ are scheduled to go on trial inCharlotte Aug. 28 on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter gave the jury the day offFriday. The prosecution is expected to rest its case today afterabout two hours of additional testimony.   The Taggart brothers joined PTL in the late 1970s as pianoplayers. Within a few years, David, 32, was promoted to Bakker's toppersonal aide and James, 35, became PTL's interior decorator.   Both were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at the televisionministry when Bakker's resigned in March 1987 following revelationsof the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.   Following a 16-month grand jury investigation into PTL'soperation under Bakker's leadership, the Taggarts were charged withtax evasion and conspiracy last December.   Prosecutors accuse them of diverting more than $1.1 million inPTL money to their own use by taking large cash advances and byusing blank ministry checks to pay off their personal credit cardbills.   Beginning July 5, testimony from dozens of New York shopkeepersand friends of the Taggarts showed the defendants went on spendingsprees in the most exclusive stores in Manhattan, Florida,California and Europe. The purchases included a $96,000 ring and an$85,000 diamond and sapphire pin.   Prosecutors charge the Taggarts used money donated to thetax-exempt religious organization to buy a $640,000 condominium inthe exclusive Trump Tower New York skyscraper on Fifth Avenue.   On Thursday, the assistant manager of a Charlotte bank testifiedthe Taggarts' combined net worth grew from $171,000 to nearly $1.7million from 1984 through 1987.   If convicted, the Taggarts each face a maximum sentence of 25years in prison and fines of up to more than $1 million.   For about seven years, David Taggart served as Bakker's personalaide for all but a short time in 1983, when he left PTL for severalmonths. Older brother James was an interior decorator whose firm waspaid more than $1.2 million over three years by PTL.</TEXT></DOC>
