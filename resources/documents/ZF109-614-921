(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Sally WinshipandM;In today's evolving world of graphical operating environments, it is crucialfor software developers to have a graphical user interface (GUI) tool thatdoesn't limit them to one platform.andM;Because of the exploding market acceptance of Windows 3.0, many developersare porting their applications to that environment.andP;  And since they do notwant to rewrite the applications, they are turning to multiplatformdevelopment tools such as Digitalk Inc.'s Smalltalk/V.andM;&quot;We had a lot of chips stacked on OS/2,&quot; said Glover Ferguson, foundationproduct executive at Andersen Consulting, a consulting firm in Chicago.andO;&quot;Unfortunately, it took off a lot slower than we had expected.andP;  Our clients,however, are indicating that they will stay with Windows.&quot;andM;Ferguson is using Smalltalk/V to commercially develop CASE applications, suchas Andersen's Design/1 analysis and design tool.andP;  Initially, the targetenvironment for the company's applications was OS/2, but it has now begundevelopment in Windows 3.0 as well.andM;&quot;At the time we began the redevelopment of Design/1, there were few tools inthe Windows environment,&quot; said Ferguson.andP;  &quot;We wanted a tool that hadoperability and wouldn't pin us into a corner in terms of operatingplatforms.&quot; Ferguson believes Smalltalk/V suits these needs.andM;Buyers of other tools agree that portability across several platforms is akey issue when purchasing development tools.andM;&quot;Portability is the most important consideration,&quot; said an analyst at achemical compound manufacturing firm who requested anonymity.andP;  &quot;When lookingfor a multiplatform tool, you need to have a sense of being able to writecode on one platform, then run a black box and have another platform on theother end.&quot;andM;The analyst is using Smalltalk/V to develop GUIs to databases.andP;  His initialdevelopment has been on OS/2, but he also plans on porting to Windows.andO;&quot;Windows is another platform that we feel has a solid standing in the market.andO;We want to make sure we're not leaving anything out,&quot; he said.andM;John Luglio, manager of product development at DataViz Inc., a softwaredevelopment firm in Trumbull, Conn., agreed.andP;  His company uses GraphicSoftware Systems Inc.'s XVT.andM;&quot;The key to us is to be able to move our application across severalplatforms,&quot; said Luglio.andP;  &quot;XVT is an easy way to migrate from one platform toanother.andM;&quot;From a technical level, you are only dealing with one set of calls.andP;  You arenot altering your code in that aspect,&quot; he continued.andP;  &quot;For example, if youare generating a scroll bar in Windows, it is pretty much the same code usingXVT.andP;  You don't have to write one set of code for Windows, another for OS/2and another for DOS.andP;  You just call up the XVT subroutine, which then dealswith other environments.andP;  It makes life much easier.&quot;andM;Denny Huber, senior program analyst at Minitab Inc., a software developmentfirm in State College, Pa., echoed that sentiment.andP;  &quot;Our product [Minitabstatistical software] comes out on a lot of different platforms -- DOS,eventually OS/2, Mac, and also minis and mainframes,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It would benice to only write one set of source code and let XVT do all thetranslating.&quot;andM;Huber two months ago discontinued using XVT, however, because thecharacter-based DOS version didn't offer all the features of the Mac and OS/2versions, he said.andP;  His company switched to Magma Systems' Magma ExtensibleWindow and Event Library GUI development tool for DOS applications.andM;Along with portability across platforms, DataViz's Luglio stressed theimportance of consistency as well.andM;&quot;You want to be confident that the bulk of features supported for any oneplatform are supported on all platforms,&quot; he said.andM;Luglio did note, however, that although it is important to have the featurespresent across all platforms, the look and feel of the applications need notbe identical.andM;&quot;To some extent, you want to provide the look and feel the user would expectto be presented with.andP;  If you're looking at a Windows application, it willtend to look different from a Motif or a DOS application,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;[Butwhen porting] from platform to platform we do not insist the look and feel tobe identical.&quot;andM;What does become important, however, is that applications on the sameplatform should look similar, according to users.andM;Phil Hartly, principal technologist at American Airlines Inc. in Fort Worth,Texas, is using ParcPlace Systems Inc.'s Objectworks-Smalltalk for internalapplications development.andM;&quot;It is important to have a common look with other applications on a specificplatform,&quot; Hartly said.andP;  &quot;If you are developing a Macintosh application, itbetter look like other Macintosh applications, and your OS/2 applicationsbetter look like other OS/2 applications.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
