Just five years ago, Japanese subsidiaries in the U.S.contributed $30 million to American nonprofit organizations.This year, experts expect $500 million in gifts. &quot;Japanesecorporate philanthropy is the fastest growing dimension ofAmerican corporate philanthropy,&quot; says Craig Smith, editorand publisher of the Corporate Philanthropy Report inSeattle. &quot;Japanese companies want people to feel they're warmand fuzzy. Philanthropy can help them.&quot;   The Japanese aren't just giving more money but are givingto more types of organizations than ever before. While in thepast they almost exclusively gave to elite institutions --endowing chairs at major universities and supportinghigh-brow cultural icons -- the Japanese are increasinglymaking donations to grass-roots groups.   &quot;We're entering a more sophisticated stage of Japanesegiving in the U.S.,&quot; says Peter Kamura, executive director ofthe Japan Center for International Exchange USA, apublic-policy group in New York. &quot;The Japanese have realizedthat check writing is not enough. They have a socialresponsibility to be involved at the community level.Otherwise, they will continue to be the faceless Japanese.&quot;   Japanese companies have sharply increased their donationsto United Way of America, for example, to about $13.5 millionlast year from $1.8 million in 1986. Toyota gave $3.1 millionto precollegiate math and science programs and other causeslast year, and Mitsui andamp; Co., an international tradingcompany, contributed more than $500,000 last year toeducation programs and other nonprofit groups.   &quot;With all the {Japan} bashing going on, our projects tryto demonstrate that there can still be constructivepartnerships between the U.S. and Japan,&quot; says Delwin A. Roy,president and chief executive officer of the HitachiFoundation. Last year the foundation, funded by Hitachi Ltd.,set aside $2.5 million for nonprofit programs; that compareswith $900,000 in 1988.   American Honda Foundation in Torrance, Calif., hopes thatits charitable activities demonstrate that the foundation'sbacker, Honda Motor Co., isn't solely motivated by makingprofit, says Kathy Carey, manager of the foundation. Thisyear, American Honda Foundation is giving about $1.2 millionto youth- and science-education programs.   Japanese companies are also intent on polishing theirimage among American minority groups. Hitachi has designatedalmost half of its gifts, about $4 million, for minorityprojects in the past five years. Toyota is granting more than$100,000 this year to the National Hispanic Scholarship Fundand Mitsui grants $10,000 annually to the National MinorityBusiness Council.   &quot;I'm sure some companies think giving to the UNCF {UnitedNegro College Fund} could mitigate their bad P.R. in theblack community. But that's only one factor . . . Japanesecompanies {also} realize that in terms of future employees,many will be minorities,&quot; says Wayne L. Alexander, projectmanager for the United Negro College Fund in Los Angeles. TheUNCF's Los Angeles office received over $100,000 fromJapanese companies last year, compared with just $25,000 fiveyears ago.   &quot;The word is out that Japanese companies want to buildrelationships with American minority organizations,&quot; adds Mr.Smith of the Corporate Philanthropy Report.   But skeptics complain that the monetary gifts areinfluencing too many American institutions and were spurredby the Japanese government, not good will.   Indeed, last year Japan instituted an arrangement workingto the advantage of companies making charitable donationsabroad. According to the Japan External Trade Organization inNew York, the tax-deductible rate for donations overseas isnow 2.5% of pretax earnings, double the rate for donationsmade in Japan. Moreover, the Japan Federation of EconomicOrganizations, or the Keidanren -- a big-businessorganization -- created a &quot;Committee for Better CorporateCitizenship&quot; headed by Sony Corp.'s Chairman Akio Morita. TheKeidanren also established a &quot;1% Club&quot; to recognize Japanesecompanies that set aside at least 1% of their pretax earningsfor philanthropy.   &quot;It's very clear what they're doing,&quot; contends Pat Choate,a Washington economist. &quot;Japan has engaged in a very thoroughprogram of public-relations activities. They want to win thehearts of American people so they won't . . . criticizeJapanese trade practices. It's propaganda.&quot;   But charity organizations, hit hard by the U.S. recessionand sluggish corporate giving, argue that philanthropy forany reason is a good deed. Many also say that Americancompanies give for essentially the same reasons as theJapanese -- to engender good will, increase their profile(and, long-term, their sales) and improve their communities.   Moreover, it could be argued that Japanese multinationalsshouldn't be criticized for doing something thatmultinationals from other countries have neglected or failedto do enough -- giving to charity wherever they do business.U.S.-based corporate giving overseas is estimated to be only$400 million annually, according to the CorporatePhilanthropy Report. And France, Germany and Britain combinedcontribute an estimated $60 million annually to U.S.nonprofit groups.   &quot;Given all the social problems we have in the U.S., are wemore interested in lambasting the Japanese at every turn orencouraging this contribution?&quot; asks Mr. Roy of Hitachi.&quot;There's a moral question, too -- why should thesecond-richest nation only be giving to the richest nation?Hopefully, {both nations} will move on to the Third World,which really needs it.&quot;   Desperate for funding, many U.S. nonprofit groups havedeveloped &quot;Japan strategies&quot; in an effort to get more money.For example, the United Way now approaches Japanese companiesthrough local chambers of commerce and encourages Japanese tojoin the charity's boards.   &quot;I don't know of a major organization that doesn't havesome link to Japan and isn't hot after Japanese money,&quot; saysClyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic StrategyInstitute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. &quot;If you're thehead of a foundation or a university and you don't have aJapan strategy, your board is probably wondering why it hasyou.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
