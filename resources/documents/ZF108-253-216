 PC Labs studies indicate that ourreviewers suffer a severe case of pixel deprivation when they stop testingthese monitors and return to working with their regular systems.andM;But if you're luckier than our reviewers--whose time with high-resolutionmonitors is limited--and you've already decided that your CAD or DTPapplications justify the joys--and the prices--of high resolution, the 15monitors reviewed on the following pages won't let you down.andP;  They offer aquantum leap in picture quality from VGA, taking full advantage of thepotential in computer-aided design, desktop publishing, and graphical userinterface software.andP;  And, since the prices of these monitors keep dropping,the rest of us can hope to see this kind of resolution someday soon.andM;As you look through the reviews on the following pages, you will see thatthere are many differences among these monitors.andP;  Unlike a typical VGAdisplay, which has a few controls and one connector, these monitors offer anarray of choices that can be bewildering.andP;  Here are some things to look foras you read the reviews and the features table.andM;To make it into this high-resolution article, each monitor had to be able toproduce a color noninterlaced 1,024-by-768 image and a standard VGA image.andO;Many of the units we tested can go even higher, to 1,280 by 1,024 pixels,though this capability is useful only if you have a graphics adapter that canproduce these signals.andP;  We received monitors from Philips and Conrac but didnot evaluate them because they were unable to handle the lower scanningfrequency required by VGA signals.andP;  We also invited Moniterm and Compaq tosubmit monitors, but they were unable to get evaluation units to us in timeto meet our testing schedule.andM;When you switch between different resolutions, the horizontal scanningfrequency changes (see the sidebar &quot;Higher Resolution: It's All in theTiming&quot;).andP;  Two problems associated with this change are maintaining picturesize and keeping the picture centered on-screen.andP;  Monitors handle theseproblems in different ways.andM;One way is to handle variable horizontal frequencies across a wide range,typically 20 KHz to 50 or 60 KHz.andP;  The circuitry inside the monitor takes itscue from the sync signal and automatically adjusts the picture size andlocation based on that.andP;  Some monitors have digital controls that allow youto make size and location adjustments for different scanning frequencies;these settings are then stored in the monitor's memory to be used wheneverthe unit receives that frequency again.andM;Another solution some vendors use is to design the monitor to accept avariety of fixed frequencies: typically VGA, 800 by 600, 1,024 by 768, and1,280 by 1,024.andP;  these monitors often have separate picture size and locationcontrols for each frequency, so you can adjust each type of signal.andM;Some monitors use a hybrid arrangement, handling variable frequencies butbreaking them into three or four ranges.andP;  You then set the picture size andlocation controls for each range, ensuring that the image will be in theright place when you use a frequncy in that range.andM;THEMES AND VARIATIONSandM;There are other differences.andP;  All the monitors reviewed here accept an analogsignal, but some require a cable with a D connector while others use BNCcoaxial connectors.andP;  (Many have provisions for both.)andP;  Some D connectors havenine pins; and others have 15.andP;  Most of the monitors that use coaxial havefive BNC connectors; these are most flexible in terms of signal acceptance.andO;A few monitors have only four BNC connectors, which means they can use only async on gree or a composite horizontal and vertical sync.andP;  They cannot handleseparate horizontal and vertical sync because that requires five connections.andM;There are other features to look for among these monitors.andP;  Some have asource-select switch, which enables you to hook up two different video cards(or two computers) to the back of the monitor and switch between them.andP;  Thereare text-color switches that let you show your text modes in green, amber,and other colors.andP;  A manual degaussing button can help eliminate the imagediscoloration that may occur when magnetic charges build up; these chargescan be created when you relocate or turn the monitor.andM;Some monitors also offer controls that allow you to adjust the screengeometry: pincushioning, convergence, and other characteristics.andP;  Thesedisplays are manufactured to exacting specifications, making them sensitiveto the effects of physical movement and the inevitable aging of electroniccomponents.andP;  As a result, you can sometimes solve an image problem withoutrequiring factory service if you have access to controls such as these.andM;MAKING THE DECISIONandM;In the final analysis, you must first decide whether you need the extraresolution these monitors offer, and then whether you need to invest in agraphics adapter that can produce the higher-frequency signals needed by thedrivers for your applications.andM;If your answers to the above are yes, you should look for the monitor thatbest fits both your budget and your needs.andM;Performance among these monitors is fairly steady across a narrow band, andjust about any one of them can produce an eye-popping image.andP;  Picture qualityis quite spectacular, with little variance from monitor to monitor (see thesidebar &quot;1,024 by 768: How Much Better than VGA?&quot;).andP;  List prices varysomewhat, but keep in mind that some are more likely to be significantlydiscounted than others.andP;  As you consider the applications and resolutions youintend to use with your new screen, features may end up being of primaryimportance.andM;Once you've made your selection, you can enjoy the amazing detail you getwith more than a thousand pixels per line.andP;  Just remember our warning: youmay never be satisfied with a VGA screen again.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
