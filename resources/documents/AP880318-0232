The administration immediately denounced the move.   Under the amendment, interpretations of the Intermediate NuclearForces treaty by President Reagan and his sucessors in the WhiteHouse would be based not just on the treaty text but on the fullrecord of Senate ratification hearings.   The condition would be attached to prevent the a recurrence ofwhat many senators have charged is Reagan's overly broadinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.   That interpretation has been used to justify testing anddevelopment of Reagan's strategic defense initiative, often called``Star Wars.''   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe decision to attach the condition _ to prevent future broadinterpretations of the INF pact _ was made at a luncheon by thefour leading senators.   They are Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia, ForeignRelations Chairman Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Armed ServicesChairman Sam Nunn of Georgia and Intelligence Committee co-chairmanDavid Boren.   The original author of the proposal was Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.   Their condition will be presented to the foreign relations panelduring consideration of the treaty next week, the sources said.   The INF, signed by Reagan and Gorbachev in December, wouldeliminate all land-based missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,125miles and has been hailed by most senators of both parties as animportant step forward in arms control.   Ratification by the required two-thirds of the Senate isexpected, but the attachments of conditions opposed by theadministration would be a complicating factor.   In a commentary attached to the proposed amendment the senatorshave said their purpose was not to resolve the dispute over the ABMTreaty.   ``Rather the provision is intended to reaffirm certainconstitutional principles which have been brought into questionduring the `reinterpretation' debate,'' the commentary said.   In that debate, many Democrats have argued that the ABM treaty,as outlined during the ratification hearings in 1972, prevents muchStar Wars testing and development. The administration has assertedthat its interpretation _ based on the text and the record ofnegotiations with the Soviets _ permits Star Wars development.   The White House, meanwhile, in a letter to Sen. Richard Lugar,R-Ind., a member of the foreign relations panel, reiterated itsopposition to attaching conditions to the INF treaty.   The letter, signed by Arthur B. Culvahouse, counsel to thepresident, and sent to Lugar on Thursday, said the resolution is``seriously flawed.''   He acknowledged that for domestic purposes a president wouldadhere to an interpretation generally agreed to by the Senate, buthe said the proposed amendment would go too far, by binding anadministration to ``all statements made by official of theexecutive branch during ratification proceedings.''   These would include ``answers to over 1,000 questions submittedby members of the Senate, no matter how trivial or how unimportantthe issue addressed may be to the Senate's advice and consentdeliberations.''   ``The result might be two INF treaties, one binding domesticallyagainst the president and a second one binding internationallybetween the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Culvahouse said.   He said the differences ``will favor the Soviet Union becausethe Soviet Union is not and cannot be bound by our domesticprocesses.''   The proposal ``only serves the interests of confusion,ambiguity, confrontation and uncertainty,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
