Also Sunday, police arrested an American woman and said theyconfiscated some 80,000 rounds of ammunition, explosives,detonators and grenades stored in her house and several otherlocations.   The move announced by Cristiani in a nationally televisedaddress occurred one day after military authorities discovered twolight planes delivering weapons to the rebels fighting theU.S.-backed government.   One plane crashed in eastern El Salvador and army troopsrecovered mostly Soviet weapons, including 25 shoulder-firedsurface-to-air missiles. One of the missiles was U.S.-made. Threecrewmen died, and the fourth committed suicide.   The other plane apparently was able to unload its cargo afterlanding in the southern part of the country, but it was unable totake off either for lack of fuel or other reasons and was set onfire by its crew, which then fled.   Three photographers were detained briefly by the military Sundaywhen they went to photograph the plane. The three are JuanaAnderson of The Associated Press, Dayna Smith of The WashingtonPost and Daymon Hartley of the Detroit Free Press. They were heldfor not having permission to be in the zone of the plane.   Cristiani told a news conference relations will remain suspendeduntil Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega ``stops intervening in ElSalvador'' or loses in national elections Feb. 25.   Missiles and other weapons taken from the wreckage of the planethat crashed were displayed at the news conference. As Cristianispoke, sounds of renewed fighting _ automatic weapons and explodingrockets _ could be heard after a pause of several days.   Later, the military explained in a news release that an armypatrol had sighted a group of guerrillas near a power transformeron the northwest edge of the capital and helicopters and C-47warplanes chased them as they fled up the slopes of San SalvadorVolcano.   The aircraft rocketed and strafed the area for several hours.   In Managua, Ortega said Sunday it gives ``honor and pride'' tothe Nicaraguan people that the government ``of assassins of priestsand religious workers'' in El Salvador broke relations withNicaragua. He urged other countries to break ties with San Salvadoruntil the Cristiani government officials ``have punished theassassins.''   He apparently was referring at least in part to the Nov. 16massacre of six Jesuit priests, their cook and her daughter at aRoman Catholic university residence. Other Jesuits at the schoolsay witnesses saw army troops enter the residence before thekillings. The government has denied responsibility.   In a statement, the Nicaraguan government denied any connectionwith the two planes. It quoted Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto assaying: ``The Salvadoran government should think about theseriousness of the declarations and actions that the news media areattributing to them, and about the serious implications in theregional peace process.''   Both the United States and a succession of U.S.-supportedgovernments here have accused Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistagovernment of providing secret military assistance to theguerrillas in their decade-old war for power. The Sandinistas denyit.   Saturday's discovery of the arms shipments was the firstconcrete evidence to back up the Salvadoran accusations.   Cristiani called the leaders of the rebel Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front, or FMLN ``puppets of Communistaggression.''   He blasted Ortega and Cuban President Fidel Castro for what hesaid was their refusal to join the wave of liberalization sweeepingmuch of the Communist world.   The arrested American was identified as Jennifer Jean Casolo, ofThomaston, Conn. She is a representative of Christian EducationalSeminar, an ecumenical group based in San Antonio, Texas, and setup to provide assistance to Americans.   Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, an armed forces spokesman, toldthe news conference that 40,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-madeM-16 rifles, 40,000 rounds of of ammunition for Soviet-designedAK-47 rifles, 203 blocks of TNT and 403 detonator-caps were foundin the house during a 2 a.m. raid and at other locations.   Chavez said the arms cache ``proves church involvement'' withthe FMLN. He did not elaborate.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeff Brown said a consular officer waswith Ms. Casolo throughout the predawn search and accompanied herto National Police headquarters.   John Blatz, a spokesman for the Christian Educational Seminar,called the accusations against Ms. Casolo ``ridiculous'' and ``partof their (the government's persecution of the churches. That'sclear.''   In a telephone interview, he said Ms. Casolo has been in ElSalvador since 1985.   More than a dozen churches and refugee centers have been raidedby security forces since the rebels launched an offensive on thecapital Nov. 11.   Cristiani said he has asked for meetings of the U.N. SecurityCouncil and the Organization of American States. He also said hewill not attend a summit of the five Central American presidentsscheduled for next month in Nicaragua.   Ortega called the meeting after talks this month in Washingtonon demobilizing the Contra rebels broke down.   Under an agreement signed by Ortega, Cristiani and three otherCentral American presidents in Tela, Honduras, the five undertookto demobilize the Contras by Dec. 5 and pledged the region'scountries would henceforth ban all aid to insurgents.   In exchange, Ortega agreed to hold national elections Feb. 25instead of in 1991 and promised the campaigning and voting would befree and fair.   Both the Bush administration and Contra leaders have beeninsisting that demobilization take place after the elections tomake sure Ortega keeps his word.   The Tela agreement was part of a peace plan to negotiate an endto the Salvadoran and Nicaraguan wars and a decades-old leftistinsurrection in Guatemala.   Two rounds of cease-fire talks between El Salvador's guerrillasand Cristiani's rightist government earlier this year ended indeadlock. A third round scheduled Nov. 20-21 was called off afterthe guerrillas launched their offensive.</TEXT></DOC>
