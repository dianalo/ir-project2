In 1990, the average household headed by people ages 45 to54 had pre-tax income of $43,451 and spent $36,996, accordingto the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   Households headed by people 35 to 44 ranked second in bothcategories, with average income of $41,208 and spending of$35,579, followed by the 55-to-64 age group, which had incomeof $35,309 and spent an average of $29,244.   In contrast, households headed by people ages 25 to 34 hadaverage income of $32,325 and spent $28,107. Householdsheaded by those 65 or older had income of $18,842 andspending of $18,546.   Middle-aged households spend more than others on nearlyeverything except health care. People in the 45-to-54 groupare likely to have grown children, some in college and othersliving and working at home. This age group spends more thanany other on food away from home, transportation,entertainment and education. They are also at that stage oflife when they are looking out for others as well asthemselves, and spend the most on both cash contributions tocharities and personal insurance and pensions.   People in the 55-to-64 age range spend less in mostcategories than those 45 to 54, with health care being onenotable exception.   People in the 35-to-44 group are likely to have school-agechildren at home and outspend all other households on food athome, housing and clothing. They also spend more than otherson alcohol.                                                                                                          Urban Areas' Growth   Picks Up Speed                                                                                                          URBANIZATION accelerated in the '80s after nearly haltingin the '70s.   The proportion of the U.S. population living in urbanareas rose 1.5 percentage points in the '80s to 75.2%,according to the 1990 census. The 1980 census had found theshare of the country's population in urban areas increasedjust one-tenth of a percent from 1970, the smallest riseever.   The wide-open spaces of the rural U.S., as defined by theCensus Bureau, have an average of 18 people per square mile,compared with 2,141 people per square mile in urban areas.   New York has the densest urban population of any state,with 4,479 people per square mile in its urban areas,according to the 1990 census. But New York isn't the mosturban state: 93% of California's population lives in urbanareas, vs. 84% of New York's.   For solitude, head to the Rockies. The eight mountainstates have an average of three people per square mile intheir rural areas. Even so, 80% of their populations clusterin urban areas, especially in the desert states of Arizona,Nevada and Utah. Urban density in this region is lower thanaverage, at 1,641 people per square mile.   The most crowded rural areas are in southern New England.Connecticut's countryside has 191 people per square mile,followed by 188 in Rhode Island and 167 in Massachusetts.   Vermont has the highest proportion of rural population,with 68% of its people living outside urban areas. Thedensity of these rural residents is 42 people per squaremile. Alaska, on the other hand, has just 33% of itspopulation living outside urban areas. Rural Alaska has just0.3 people per square mile.                                                                                                          AIDS, Murder Spur Rise   In Young-Adult Deaths                                                                                                          DEATH RATES for older people have declined, but those ofyoung adults have risen, mostly because of AIDS and murder.   Death rates for people 65 or older fell nearly 3% in 1989,the latest year for which the National Center for HealthStatistics has detailed figures.   At the same time, death rates rose 2% from a year earlierfor people ages 25 to 34, and climbed 1% for those ages 35 to44. Death rates eased in the 15-to-24 group, for whichaccidents are by far the leading cause of death.   Because older people account for a large share of totaldeaths, the decline in their death rates meant the number ofdeaths in the U.S. fell 0.8%, despite a growing and agingpopulation, to 2,150,466 in 1989. Among the 65-and-overpopulation, there were 4,963 deaths per 100,000 people in1989, compared with just 176 deaths per 100,000 people ages25 to 44.   Death rates in 1989 fell for 10 of the 15 leading causesof death, many of them associated with old age. Declines weregreatest for atherosclerosis, blood poisoning and kidneydisease. Heart disease and stroke, the first and third mostcommon causes of death, continued long-term declines.   But death rates for AIDS and homicides rose in 1989. AIDSbecame the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S., up from15th in 1988, and three out of four people who die of AIDSare in the 25-to-44 age group.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          PEOPLE seem to have &quot;fragile memories about the sizes offood portions,&quot; says Albert F. Smith of the State Universityof New York at Binghamton. A series of experiments on dietaryrecall also finds that, when asked what they have eatenduring a designated period, people tend to report foods theyroutinely consume rather than those they specificallyremember eating. . . . A survey conducted for Outsidemagazine by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman finds that topvacation picks of &quot;outside enthusiasts&quot; in the 1990s will bethe Caribbean, Canada, the western U.S. and Hawaii. Itdefines outside enthusiasts as people who engage in two ormore outdoor activities, including running, swimming, skiing,bicycling, and hiking.</TEXT></DOC>
