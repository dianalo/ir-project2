Andthere's little doubt that dealers who have played ball with IBM will be giventhe opportunity to expand first.andM;It's a high-stakes game.andP;  Played out successfully, IBM stands to win manymore hearts of dealers.andP;  But one misstep could permanently damage arelationship IBM has struggled desperately to cultivate.andP;  And success couldhinge on two simple premises: that IBM will once again dominate the marketand that resellers will accept that IBM knows what's best for them.andM;----------Charles Humphrey is a longtime business journalist who, since 1982, haschronicled the evolution of the various distribution channels formicrocomputer products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
