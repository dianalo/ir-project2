(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Front-runner Michael Dukakis became thefocus of attacks from his Democratic rivals Sunday as theRepublican hopefuls traded barbs in one last debate in theincreasingly bitter campaign for the New Hampshire primary.   Less than 48 hours before the first votes will be cast in thefirst primary, GOP candidate Pat Robertson called for the gradualabolition of Social Security. Opponent Jack Kemp said the formertelevision evangelist has ``some off-the-wall ideas.''   George Bush and Bob Dole, running neck-and-neck for Tuesday'sprimary, tossed charges back and forth in the hour-long League ofWomen Voters debate on Sunday night.   ``You were for it before you read it. I waited to read it first.That's the difference,'' Dole said about the new arms controltreaty with the Soviets.   ``I was for it when the president proposed it,'' Bush retorted.   Later in the debate, Kemp blew up at Bush when the vicepresident used the 1960s phrase, ``Give peace a chance.''   ``You should be embarrassed to use `Give peace a chance','' Kempsaid. ``We're the party of peace through strength.''   Kemp also went after Dole.   ``I am convinced that Senator Dole has a secret plan to raisetaxes on the American people,'' Kemp said in Bedford, N.H., beforethe debate. ``That would totally frustrate the Republican messagethat we are the low-tax party.''   On the Democratic side, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois switched toattacking Dukakis, the clear front-runner in the Democratic field.Simon dropped his controversial focus on Missouri Rep. RichardGephardt, with whom he is battling for the No. 2 spot.   ``I think it is increasingly clear that Paul Simon is now aheadof Dick Gephardt,'' Simon told a Manchester news conference.``There is a difference, and a clear alternative to Mike Dukakis.''   Simon is emphasizing a new ad aimed at the Massachusettsgovernor:   ``In endorsing Paul Simon for president, the LawrenceEagle-Tribune of Massachusetts said `President Dukakis would head abureaucracy. President Simon would head a nation of people,''' thead said.   Simon denied that the ad change had anything to do withGephardt's harsh criticism of the commercials.   For his part, Gephardt has a television ad calling Dukakis ``oneof the biggest tax raisers in Massachusetts history.'' The Missouricongressman rejected suggestions he embraced Reaganomics in 1981 as``balderdash,'' saying the question was ``were we for the tax cutfor the middle class or we were not?''   Dukakis rejected the suggestion in Simon's ad.   ``We didn't have dozens and dozens of UAW members (United AutoWorkers) up here working their heads off and dozens and dozens offirefighters working their heads off for me yesterday because theydon't think I'm for working men and women,'' Dukakis said inManchester.   Early in the debate, Bush said the differences among theRepublicans were not what they seem.   ``We're going to be together after this...So it doesn't have thedeep decisions that you might think from the agony of the moment orthe ad of the moment or from the charge and countercharge,'' Bushsaid.   But he and Dole continued their charges about leadership outsidethe debate format.   ``I don't think he has made any decisions in the last sevenyears,'' the Kansas senator said of Bush in a CBS News interviewbroadcast Sunday.   Dole said he is pleased with his progress in New Hampshire _where Bush once had a big lead: ``I have come a long way in thelast 30 days.''   For his part, Bush defended his campaign's ads that say Dole has``straddled'' making decisions on several major issues.   ``The man is running on leadership,'' Bush told reporters inNashua. ``I think it is fair to look at the results.''   Robertson, who ran second in the Iowa caucuses, still grabbedthe attention as he said he might do even better in New Hampshire.   ``I want to have the satisfaction of seeing the televisionanchormen's faces when they have to report that Pat Robertson wonNew Hampshire,'' the former television evangelist told acongregation at the Faith Christian Center in Bedford, N.H.   Church ushers ordered reporters not to take tape recorders orpens and paper into the service, checking them at the door toenfoce the rule. Robertson gave a political speech in which hetalked of how his life had been guided by God's messages, includinghis race for the White House.   Asked if he might best Bush again, Robertson said on CBS-TV's``Face the Nation'': ``Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing for thecountry?''   Robertson said ``there isn't going to be any money'' availablein Social Security in the next century when younger people retire.Thus, he wants to gradually abolish the system, while payingcurrent benefits, ``over 40 years, moving it into a privatesystem.''   Kemp, who is battling Robertson for conservative hearts, mindsand votes, lashed out at the former preacher.   ``He has said some off-the-wall things about the economy, aboutforeign policy,'' Kemp said on NBC-TV's ``Meet The Press.'' Askedfor specifics, Kemp said Robertson has said, ``Credit cards are themark of the beast and that we are going to hell in a hand basketbecause of the deficit.''   Dole said he thought Robertson would not do as well in NewHampshire as in Iowa.   ``He broke a lot of china in Iowa and he's working very hard inthe state of New Hampshire. Who knows?'' Dole said on ABC-TV's``This Week with David Brinkley.''. ``I think it is a lot moredifficult for him in a state like New Hampshire.''   Kemp and Robertson both distributed literature at churches, atactic Robertson used successfuly last Sunday in Iowa. Kemp workerswere in the church parking lots passing out brochures headlined,``Jack Kemp _ The candidate for believers,'' while Robertson forcesonce again handed out a ``Biblical Scoreboard.''   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart said he would not end hisborn-again Democratic campaign if he does not do well in NewHampshire, the state that gave him a miracle victory in 1984.   ``Of course not,'' was his reply to the question on the NBCprogram.   And Hart said he is not just on an ego trip by continuing hiscampaign: ``I'm not a dog in the manger. I'm not a spoiler.''   New polls by ABC News and CBS News showed Bush and Dole knottedat about 30 percent among Republicans. Kemp, Robertson and du Pontwere tied at about 10 percent.   On the Democratic side, Dukakis kept his big lead with around 40percent in both surveys. Simon and Gephardt were fighting forsecond. They were tied in the ABC poll, but Gephardt held a tinylead in the CBS survey. Others trailed.</TEXT></DOC>
