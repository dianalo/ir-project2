The Army and Navy had been conducting the weapons tests at military facilities in Virginia, Alabama, New Mexico and in the Chesapeake Bay. The experiments, which involve powerful electrical pulses that travel at the speed of light, are aimed at evaluating the possible effects of enemy electromagnetic weapons. Also, the pulses simulate some of the effects of nuclear radiation and are designed to help the military design equipment to withstand the environmental fallout from nuclear attacks.    According to the Foundation on Economic Trends, which sued the Defense Department in federal court here, the tests could knock out electrical systems, interfere with nearby commercial aircraft, and harm humans with pacemakers.    A court order to be filed today bars the military from resuming the outdoor electromagnetic tests until it has complied with a string of environmental requirements contained in the National Environmental Policy Act. </TEXT></DOC>
