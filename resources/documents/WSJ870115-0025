Paul Freedenberg, assistant secretary of commerce for trade administration, said the U.S. will propose steps to attain allied cooperation in the effort to include the independent countries at a meeting next month of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls. Cocom, as the Paris-based body is known, includes representatives from the U.S., Japan and 15 North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries.    The planned U.S. initiative is in line with one of the recommendations of a National Academy of Sciences report released yesterday. The report, which reflects the views of many in U.S. industry, specifically urges the U.S. to abandon its effort at unilateral controls because they serve only to hurt U.S. producers without adequately stemming the flow of sensitive goods to the Soviet bloc.    If nonaligned nations like India, Brazil and Singapore can be persuaded to join the U.S. and Cocom countries in adopting controls, then the U.S. should drop many of its unilateral measures, the report said. Mr. Freedenberg said these countries could be made to cooperate under certain circumstances.    The study claimed that the Reagan administration's &quot;overzealous&quot; export-control policies irritate allies and cost thousands of U.S. jobs without significantly adding to national security. It urged various policy changes to strike a better balance between security interests and trade concerns.    The administration doesn't plan to respond formally to the academy's report for several weeks. But some federal agencies had anticipated its recommendations. Lew Allen Jr., chairman of the panel that produced the 18-month study, said the National Security Council has responded favorably to a proposal that its role in arbitrating interagency conflicts on export controls be expanded.    &quot;We've spoken to (NSC Director) Frank Carlucci and he's interested,&quot; Mr. Allen said. Mr. Carlucci couldn't be reached for comment. But Mr. Freedenberg, who speaks for the administration on export-control matters, confirmed that the NSC is considering playing a bigger role.    The council's mediation has been needed in the past to resolve disputes between the Pentagon, which wants tough controls, and the Commerce Department, which is also concerned with promoting exports. The National Academy of Sciences report urges the NSC to expand its staff that monitors the export-licensing process. In another recommendation reflecting the view of U.S. industry, the academy report also advises the Commerce and State departments to regain &quot;leadership&quot; it says they have lost to the Pentagon in forming export-control policies. Mr. Allen, a former Air Force chief of staff who now serves as vice president of the California Institute of Technology, said that while the Pentagon has done a &quot;commendable&quot; job in taking an early initiative on the issue, the U.S. now must reassess its policies.    The Defense Department may have a hard time accepting the panel's recommendation to scale down its export-control activities. The Pentagon has developed a full-blown export-control agency under Stephen Bryen, deputy undersecretary of defense for trade security policy.    The U.S. Customs Service and other enforcement agencies may have a different problem with the academy's findings. The report says that Soviet theft of limited numbers of finished, advanced-technology products won't significantly hurt western security. The real danger, it says, is if the Russians obtain blueprints or equipment used to manufacture the advanced products.    The Customs Service and other enforcement agencies, however, have put considerable effort into systems to prevent diversion of even single shipments of computers and other finished goods.    The panel's other recommendations included:    --Removing products that don't represent the leading edge of technology from the list of items that require export licenses.    --Withdrawing controls on U.S. products if they are readily available in non-Cocom countries. </TEXT></DOC>
