The Labor Department's report, showing the unemployment rate falling to 5.3% of the civilian work force from 5.4% in September and 6% in October 1987, provided a last-minute burst of good economic news for George Bush's presidential campaign. Manufacturing payrolls surged following two months of decline while factory overtime rose, suggesting that export growth and the improvement in the trade deficit are back on track. For the second month in a row, a record 62.4% of the adult population was employed.    &quot;It's a good report,&quot; said Robert Wescott, vice president at Alphametrics Corp. in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. The report &quot;counters any suggestions that things were weakening going into the election.&quot;    At the same time, the drop brought the unemployment rate further below a level that many economists consider full employment, and may bolster the view among some Federal Reserve officials that further restraint is needed to slow growth to a sustainable, noninflationary pace. The Fed is likely to pay particular attention to the 0.8% rise in the department's hourly earnings index last month.    Although the dollar soared in foreign-currency markets following the release of the report, bond market investors reacted with gloom, sending interest rates higher on fears of a tighter Fed policy. The stock market also fell.    &quot;There is an implication that the Fed has to do something, though I don't know that we will see a knee-jerk reaction,&quot; said Michel Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York.    President Reagan lauded the unemployment report as &quot;very, very good news for the American people.&quot; But an aide to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis noted that the unemployment rate for blacks and Hispanics remains much higher than that for whites, and said, &quot;While some people may be encouraged by this 5.3% rate, there are still many people in this country unable to work. . . . There's still more work to be done.&quot;    The unemployment rate last month rose to 11% from 10.8% for blacks and to 7.7% from 7.4% for Hispanics.    For the past several weeks most economic data, including sluggish retail sales and factory orders, have suggested that economic growth was softening. The October jobless report appears to contradict all that, with nonfarm payrolls rising 323,000 after a revised 304,000-job gain in September that was previously put at 255,000. Unlike September, when much of the gain reflected stronger-than-usual hiring by public schools, last month's increase came entirely in the private sector.    Most striking was a 99,000 jump in factory jobs, with the biggest gains in food processing, lumber and wood products, fabricated metals, machinery and autos. The rise in food-processing jobs partly reflected fewer autumn cutbacks than normal after light summer hiring caused by the drought. Average weekly factory hours fell to 41.1 hours from 41.2 in September, although they remained at a high level by historical standards. Overtime rose to four hours a week from 3.9. In all private jobs, average hours rose 0.1 hour to 34.8 a week.    The Labor Department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, rose to 181.6% of its 1977 average from 180.2% in September. Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of WEFA Group Inc. in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said, &quot;This was the most discouraging part of the report. If it continues it will force the Fed to think about tightening.&quot;    Still, while the report is likely to quiet talk of a serious softening in economic growth, some analysts cautioned against overreacting to a single month's favorable number, especially in light of previous data suggesting a slackening in growth. &quot;Just as one shouldn't have jumped to the conclusion that the economy was falling apart, one shouldn't now decide that we're in a new boom,&quot; said Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.    At 5.3%, the overall jobless rate matches the June rate, which was the lowest since May 1974. Using a separate measure that includes the military among the employed, the rate fell to 5.2% from 5.3%.    Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report.
