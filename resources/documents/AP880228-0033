Vassiliou, leader of 500,000 Greek Cypriots, said shortly aftertaking the oath of office that he would pursue a meeting withTurkish Prime Minister Turgut Oza ``as soon as possible.''   But Vassiliou also cautioned that ``until we reach a just andviable settlement, the constant improvement of our defensivecapability is of the higest priority ... so that we may be able toface the worst eventuality.''   After the ceremony, Vassiliou, 56, a millionaire businessman wonthe presidency Feb. 21 as an independent with communist backing,announced the makeup of his 11-member Council of Ministers _ nineof whom are political newcomers.   Vassiliou said any solution to the Cyprus crisis must includethe withdrawal of an estimated 30,000 Turkish troops and 65,000settlers on the northern third of the island.   A settlement also would have to allow 200,000 Greek Cypriots toreturn to their northern homes and include international guaranteesagainst foreign intervention, he said.   ``The settlement we seek for the Cyprus problem is defined bythe relevant United Nations resolutions ... and is a settlementthat safeguards the independence, sovereignty, territorialintegrity, unity and non-alignment of Cyprus,'' Vassiliou said inhis inaugural address before the 50-seat House of Represenatives.   The east Mediterranean island has been unofficially partitionedsince Turkey occupied its northern third in 1974. The Turkishinvasion followed a coup by Greek Cypriots and Greek army officerssupporting a union with Greece.   Vassiliou charged that 14 years after the invasion, ``Turkey ismethodically Turkeyfying our (occupied) land while the occupationtroops increase and are supplied with the latest type of armaments.   ``The settlers from the mainland are also increasing,suppressing the Turkish Cypriots and altering the demographiccomposition of the population.   ``We are faced by the worst calamity in our centuries-longhistory,'' he said.   The Turkish Cypriot minority, which makes up 17 percent of thepopulation of 650,000, proclaimed its own breakaway state in theTurkish-occupied north in 1983. The state only has been recognizedby Turkey.   Talks between the two sides have been deadlocked for two years.Vassiliou's predecessor, Spyros Kyprianou, refused to resumenegotiations until Turkey withdrew its troops and settlers.   During the campaign, Vassiliou said he would be flexible innegotiations, but maintained that the issue of troop withdrawalshould be tackled first.   Addressing the House of Representatives, composed only of GreekCypriots since the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities split in1963, Vassiliou said ``it is sad that the representatives of theTurkish Cypriot community are absent.   ``We hope to have the Turkish Cypriots among us again soon, sothat in a democratic, free Cyprus, we shall be able to build abetter, peaceful tomorrow, for the good of the whole people ofCyprus.   Vassiliou, who built the largest business consulting firm in theMiddle East, said he supported a free enterprise economy. He alsosaid Cyprus would remain a non-aligned nation.</TEXT></DOC>
