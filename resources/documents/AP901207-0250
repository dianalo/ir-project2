The jury, which deliberated nine hours over two days following aseven-week trial, found the reprint was false and defamatory, butthat the original series was not false.   ``The verdict is bizarre because they said the articlesthemselves were true but they were false when they werereprinted,'' said William Hangley, the Inquirer's lawyer.   Hangley suggested the jury may have considered an editorial andcartoon also included in the tabloid reprint.   He said the paper will appeal.   ``We are confident this result cannot stand,'' he said.   The jurors refused to comment after the verdict.   The award was the second libel judgment against the Inquirerthis year.   Common Pleas Court Judge John Lavelle had told the jury thatJustice James T. McDermott had to prove the articles, written byreporter Daniel Biddle, were defamatory, false and published withactual malice, and that he suffered harm.   The Inquirer has won 17 Pulitzer Prizes during the past twodecades, including one by Biddle for another court series.   Last May, a jury awarded Philadelphia lawyer Richard Sprague arecord $34 million over a 1973 story that criticized his handlingof a homicide case when he was an assistant district attorney. TheInquirer is appealing.   The 64-year-old McDermott, a member of the state's highest courtsince January 1982, sued on grounds the articles titled ``Above theLaw'' implied he fixed cases.   The articles were published in May 1983 and reprinted in 1984 todistribute to journalism and law schools.   The reprints, sub-headed ``the questionable conduct of theSupreme Court,'' claimed many of the justices ignored thePennsylvania Code of Judicial Ethics, which the court adopted in1974.   The articles suggested McDermott shouldn't have participated intwo cases involving lawyers from the Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish andamp;Kauffman firm, which had been the largest contributor to his 1981election, because it was a conflict of interest.   The articles noted McDermott accepted $6,100 from thePhiladelphia law firm, that one of the firm's lawyers had arrangeda 1981 trip to the Pennsylvania coal region, and three months afterthe justice took his seat on the court he voted favorably forDilworth clients.   In asking the jury to find in favor of the newspaper, Hangleydeclared, ``We say that Justice McDermott did something wrong; thathe didn't abide by the Pennsylvania Code of Judicial Conduct.''   ``Did we say he committed a crime? No. Has he fixed a case?No,'' Hangley said. ``But he did ignore the code that says heshouldn't have participated in cases where his partiality isquestioned.''   McDermott's lawyer, James Beasley, argued that accusing thejustice ``of being partial, that's accusing him of a crime.''   Besides the two cases involving Dilworth lawyers, McDermott alsoclaimed he was defamed when the newspaper implied he had improperlyused his judicial influence to get his son a job in thePhiladelphia district attorney's office. The son still works forthe prosecutor.   Biddle testified his stories were fair, truthful and accurate,and insisted that what he wrote concerned the official actions, notonly of McDermott, but of all justices.   Only McDermott sued.   ``The Code of Judicial Conduct, which I researched and used inmy story, says in Pennsylvania a judge should not participate wherehis partiality might reasonably be questioned,'' Biddle testified.``To act against that code ... is to engage in misconduct.''   While McDermott acknowledged that the reported facts weresubstantially true he insisted the inferences and innuendos theyraised, and the way paragraphs were positioned in the paper, leftthe impression he was dishonest.   He had demanded a retraction before he sued.   ``All I wanted was for them to say that I was an honest man, andnot corrupt,'' he testified. ``If they had done it, we wouldn'thave to spend all this time and all this money, and be in thiscourtroom.''   The justice said that ``never, ever'' did he have financialties, receive any personal gifts or have any conflicts of interestwith anyone involved in cases before the Supreme Court.</TEXT></DOC>
