The contribution of this anomalyto the gluon condensate and dilaton mass is deterined in two-loop approximation.The criterion for realization of the light synamics is obtained. In non-asymptoticallyfree theories with fixed point it is shown that the form of the anomalydepends on the type of its phase.</TEXT></DOC>
