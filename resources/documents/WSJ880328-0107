ITT Rayonier, a forest-products unit of ITT Corp., declined to disclose the terms.    The transaction doesn't involve Rayonier Timberlands L.P., a separate entity into which most of ITT Rayonier's timberland was spun off in 1985. An ITT Rayonier spokesman said the unit normally buys only timber, not land, but nonetheless has continued to have some land holdings. </TEXT></DOC>
