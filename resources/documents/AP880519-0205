North and former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter made damaging admissions to Congressabout the Iran-Contra affair that could be used as evidence againstthem in court, prosecutors said Thursday.   Poindexter's statement that he approved North's plan to funnelprofits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels andadmissions by him and North that they destroyed documents during a1986 investigation were among numerous excerpts of congressionaltestimony that prosecutors said were admissible in court.   Even though they testified on Capitol Hill under limited grantsof immunity from prosecution, former National Security Council aideNorth, Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim made statements thatcan be used against them when the Iran-Contra case goes to trial infederal court, the prosecution said.   ``Volunteered testimony by defendants in their congressionaltestimony is not immunized and may be directly introduced at trialagainst them,'' independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said inbriefs filed in U.S. District Court.   The three defendants are accused along with retired Air ForceMaj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, who gave congressional testimonywithout an immunity grant, of conspiring to defraud the governmentby diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to theNicaraguan rebels.   The indictment includes charges that North destroyed documentsduring the November 1986 Justice Department investigation of theIran-Contra affair that uncovered the diversion of arms-saleprofits.   It also accuses Poindexter and North of lying to congressionalcommittees by denying involvement in private Contra resupplyefforts.   Walsh offered to ``forego the use of congressional testimony''to smooth the way for a quick trial as a way of satisfying defensecomplaints that the prosecution illegally relied on immunizedstatements of the defendants.   However, Walsh cited hundreds of statements by North, Poindexterand Hakim that were either voluntary or not responsive to thespecific question posed by the committees and therefore not coveredby the immunity grants.   In a joint filing, defense lawyers called ``simply absurd''Walsh's claim that the three defendants waived their privilegeagainst self-incrimination during the congressional hearing.   ``Each defendant claimed his privilege at the very outset andnever relinquished it,'' the defense said. ``The court shouldflatly reject the IC's (independent counsel's) attempt tocircumvent the immunity statute.''   The defense also urged the judge to dismiss the indictment onthe ground that Walsh took insufficient steps to isolate his stafffrom the defendants' immunized testimony, which ``has seeped intoevery corner of this case.''   The statements that Walsh maintains are not covered by theimmunity grants included Poindexter's assertion that the diversionproposed by North ``was clearly a new aspect that I had not thoughtabout before. To make a long story short, in the end I thought itwas a very good idea ... and I personally approved it.''   ``In my view,'' Poindexter continued, ``it was a matter ofimplementation of the president's policy with regard to support forthe Contras.''   Poindexter also admitted that he ``made a very deliberatedecision not to ask the president so that I could insulate him fromthe decision and provide some future deniability for the presidentif it ever leaked out.''   The excerpts also include North's statements that he shreddedNSC documents while Justice Department officials were in the nextroom during the November 1986 inquiry, prosecutors said in thebriefs.   ``I remember shredding documents while they were in therereading documents,'' North told the committee.   ``Do you remember _ shredding them in their presence?'' askedArthur Liman, counsel for the Senate panel.   ``I mean, they were sitting in my office and the shredder wasright outside and I walked out and shredded documents,'' North said.   Walsh contended he could also use Poindexter's statements thathe intended to withhold information from the chairman of the HouseIntelligence Committee and his belief that North was evasive andwithheld information from Congress.   ``I testified that I have withheld information from Congress andwith regard to Cabinet officers, I didn't withhold anything fromthem that they didn't want withheld from them,'' Poindexter toldthe panel.   Of North's testimony to the House Intelligence Committee,Poindexter testified, ``I expected him to be evasive.''   Poindexter said he was sure North's answers ``were verycarefully crafted, nuanced. The total impact, I'm sure, was one ofwithholding information from the Congress.''   Walsh, meanwhile, also asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell to set a trial date, arguing that defense claims that theprosecution illegally relied on compelled congressional testimonywere meritless.   He argued that Gesell should set a trial date and reservejudgment on the immunity issues until later. ``A demand for anyfurther pre-trial hearings (by the defense) would constitute atransparent attempt at delay,'' Walsh argued.</TEXT></DOC>
