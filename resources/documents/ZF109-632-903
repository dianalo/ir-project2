 Tosummarize briefly:andM;* CDA Toolkit for OS/2.andP;  Digital is now offering an OS/2 toolkit for buildingapplication software that make use of its Compound Document Architecture.andO;The OS/2 toolkit is the first for non-Digital platforms; DEC hopes to have aMac one available within a few months.andM;* DECwrite on OS/2.andP;  The &quot;proof&quot; that CDA works on OS/2 is DECwrite OS/2, aport of its compound document processor, which is currently offered on Ultrixand VMS workstations.andP;  DECwrite lacks some of the typographical features ofthe DeScribe Word Publisher, but it does include impressive linkingcapabilities, as we'll discuss below.andM;* DECpresent.andP;  The first general-purpose presentation graphics package forthe Unix market, DECpresent, is a dandy.andP;  Digital customers will undoubtedlybe thrilled.andP;  Users of other platforms may drool and wish that DEC would portit to other boxes.andM;An impressive showing.andP;  We had our first look at these products at theConference, but, in addition, we tried out a startling new voice-activatedtechnology and were briefed on the status of third-party publishing productsfor Digital platforms.andP;  First, the third parties.andM;Third-party products.andP;  Digital highlighted its support from independentsoftware developers by hosting several heavy hitters in its booth.andP;  Adobeshowed Illustrator for the DECstation, its first Unix port of its popularMacintosh and PC product.andP;  Illustrator is expected to be available for Ultrixworkstations later this year.andP;  Frame showed version 2.1X of FrameMaker, whichsports a Motif user interface.andP;  It is available now for Ultrix workstationsat the same price as other FrameMaker versions.andM;Digital deepened its commitment to Odesta and Verity.andP;  Digital is nowlicensed to distribute both Odesta DMS and Verity's Topic; previously it hadonly cooperative marketing alliances with these firms.andP;  It also demonstratedhow, in the long term, it plans to offer retrieval technology as a networkservice, available to any developer through a single application programminginterface (API).andP;  Its API would most likely support both Topic and Basis.andO;Basis is full-text retrieval software developed by Battelle ResearchInstitute.andM;DEC also reaffirmed its commitment to offer an API for &quot;knowledge links,&quot; aterm that encompasses both referential (hypertext) and inclusion links (oftencalled live, or hot, links).andM;Halfway through the Conference, Digital pulled another coup: it announced anagreement with Adobe under which the two companies will explore therelationship between editable PostScript and Digital's own interchange format(DDIF).andP;  At first, the firms will examine the relationship between the twowith regard to graphics.andP;  But in the long run, teaming with Adobe may be justthe political move DEC needs to garner support for CDA.andM;DECwrite for OS/2: a look at the links.andP;  We did not have a chance tothoroughly test the composition and page makeup features of DECwrite.andP;  Itstill may be thought of as a &quot;scaled-down FrameMaker,&quot; but we hope to get acopy in-house with which to make more substantive evaluations.andP;  SinceFrameMaker is not available on PCs, the closest product to DECwrite for OS/2is DeScribe Word Publisher, which we also have yet to review.andP;  (See theprevious section in this issue for the latest news about DeScribe.)andM;One aspect of DECwrite we did examine was the hot links.andP;  DECwrite for OS/2offers two types: links to other OS/2 applications via Microsoft's DynamicData Exchange (DDE) and links to applications running on OS/2, Ultrix or VMSvia Digital's linking mechanism in CDA.andM;At the Conference, Digital demonstrated the link to Excel.andP;  With this link,an Excel spreadsheet was linked to a DECwrite table; changes in the sourcespreadsheet were automatically reflected in the DECwrite document.andP;  Or werethey?andP;  It seems that if OS/2 and each of the applications are aware that theyare running at the same time, then data can be dynamically updated.andP;  For thisto happen with Excel, the other application has to be running on the sameworkstation as Excel.andM;But in a network setting, the link mechanism has limitations.andP;  When Excelopens a file on a network server, it copies the file into memory and thencloses it back to the disk.andP;  The operating system no longer knows the file isopen.andP;  The DECwrite user logging in at a different workstation links to thefile on the server disk.andP;  Dynamic exchange is not possible in this context.andO;The Excel file will only be updated on disk when the user saves the file, andDECwrite will only check the disk when its file is closed and reopened.andP;  Theupshot: if you want the latest version of the data in your document, open allpossible source files yourself and then print.andM;(We didn't get to test it, but it also appears that Excel's open/closeapproach prevents OS/2 from providing proper file locking.)andM;The lack of network awareness in OS/2 and Microsoft Excel is disturbing.andO;Here is the operating system for the '90s and its &quot;example&quot; application, andthe much-touted link facility does not even work across a network.andP;  If otherdevelopers take Excel as their example, all of the applications will sufferfrom the same flaw.andP;  We hope that developers and end users will demand thatMicrosoft take some corrective action, and soon.andM;DIDDLY, the almost-human database.andP;  Its name is a little too cute, but DEC'sDigital Integrated Distributed Database Laboratory was a startling look atfuture technology.andM;DIDDLY is a multimedia database that makes use of a speech synthesizer toexecute commands, rather than requiring keyboard or mouse input.andP;  Using aheadset microphone, the user prompts the machine by saying the word &quot;DIDDLY.&quot;andO;As soon as it recognizes its name (it sometimes takes a couple of tries), thesystem responds to whatever is said next: typically a command to show apicture, play a video or animated sequence, call up a text file, or even,using the same speech synthesizer, read a text file.andP;  The library of commandswas small, but it was trained on more than 1,000 voices and was notprogrammed to any one speaker.andP;  We tried the headset ourselves following aDigital demo and found that it had little trouble responding, even though ithad never heard our voice before!andM;The application demonstrated was a hospital setting in which all of apatient's pertinent information was saved in the database.andP;  The patient,being treated for severe head injuries suffered during an automobileaccident, was photographed and X-rayed, had his vital signs monitored andunderwent CAT scans and cardiograms.andP;  Still images could be accessedseparately, or they could be put together as a whole to show a rotating,three-dimensional view of the skull or the brain.andP;  In one sequence, a view ofthe solid head was followed by one that stripped away the skin and muscle toexpose the bone of the skull.andP;  The patient's heartbeat was played back.andP;  Thepatient's admission records were digitized and displayed on the screen andread back by DIDDLY on request.andM;Underneath, DIDDLY is an application of Digital's RDM database, with modulesfor speech recognition and viewers for the different types of media containedin the database.andM;The quality of the images was superb, yet DIDDLY features software thatcompresses video images up to 60 times without noticeable loss in detail.andO;DEC claimed it was storing a full minute of video (16 frames a second) inless than a megabyte.andP;  A &quot;low-end color graphics card,&quot; typical of what a DECworkstation would already have, was used to drive the display.andP;  The onlyextra hardware the system required was a single audio chip, which recordedthe voice of the speaker and played back audio portions from the database.andM;Incredibly, it took two engineers just six weeks to devise the system.andP;  Onereason is that much more than half of the technology is currently availableor in the field undergoing testing.andP;  All the DEC engineers had to do was putit together for a specific application.andM;Who needs a speech recognition system when you can just as easily typecommands at a keyboard or select menus with a mouse?andP;  In general, people whowould like access to a database while both of their hands are busy.andP;  Forexample, the demo showed how a surgeon might make use of DIDDLY while in theoperating room.andP;  Another demo showed how it might be used by a pilot in thecockpit of a plane or by an air traffic controller to examine maps and othercartographic information.andM;We've seen demonstations of voice recognition before, but none as compellingas DIDDLY.andP;  Likewise, the use of multimedia as an enabling technology--ratherthan as an end in itself--was a welcome change from the technology showcasesthat capture so much attention at trade shows.andP;  Digital instruments and mediaare pervading nearly every business in the world.andP;  DIDDLY was a preview ofwhat can happen when they begin to come together.andM;On a roll.andP;  Digital has a good pitch with CDA, but it has been slow tocapture the support of application developers.andP;  Now it is adding some biggerguns, although not everyone is yet taking advantage of all of the services.andO;We would urge software developers to examine the architecture: developingconformance would not restrict a product developed for other platforms, butit would hedge the bet that Digital may succeed in establishing thisarchitecture as the de facto standard.andM;Next newsandM;Every day seems to bring word of new third-party Next products, and severalwere announced around and during the time of the Seybold show.andP;  One of themost important was Novell's announcement that it is working with Next todevelop software to allow Next machines to join Novell networks without theneed for bridging software or hardware.andP;  Right now, you have to use somethinglike Cayman's GatorBox to connect Next machines to other networks.andP;  TheGatorBox works, but it represents an extra step and added expense, so directconnect capabilities would be very helpful.andP;  Novell did not announce anyprojected dates or prices.andM;Another significant development was Altsys's announcement that it is portingthe graphics/illustration technology it licensed to Aldus (for FreeHand) tothe Next cube.andP;  (See &quot;Fonts&quot; in the output section in this issue for coverageof Altsys.)andM;Peripheral Land, Inc., the company that makes storage devices for Apple, hasannounced that it will be making two storage devices for Next computers: theSuperFloppy 2.8 and the MachOne.andP;  The SuperFloppy 2.8 is an externalSCSI-based floppy disk that reads, writes and formats 720-KB, 1.44-MB, andNext's new 2.88-MB-capacity disks.andP;  Its list price is $499.andP;  The MachOne is aRAM storage system with a data transfer rate of 5 MB per second.andP;  It will beavailable in 20-, 40-, 100-and 200-megabyte configurations; list prices startat $4,995 (for the 20-MB one).andM;Stone Design, the small, innovative company that created TextArt, a textmanipulation program for the Next, demonstrated Create at the Seybold show.andO;It has the same capabilities as TextArt, it but can do everything in color.andO;You can also draw Bezier curves and fill them with color.andP;  We are lookingforward to spending a few colorful and imaginative hours with Create in frontof the color Next.andP;  The product will be shipped next summer; the list priceis $495.andM;Silicon Graphics switches to AdobeandM;Where Next leaves off (15 MIPS), Silicon Graphics begins (16 MIPS and up withits Iris workstations).andP;  SGI announced that it would license Adobe's DisplayPostScript to run on the entire line of Iris 4D workstations.andP;  SGI said thatthis will be the first 32-bit color implementation of Display PostScript torun under the X windowing system.andP;  The X, Display PostScript and SGI'sGraphics Library imaging models will be integrated into a single system,enabling developers to choose the imaging model most appropriate for theirapplications.andP;  SGI's merged imaging models will use OSF/Motif as theirgraphical user interface.andM;SGI's switch to Adobe is a switch from its previous position as a licensee ofSun's News.andP;  Sun is offering to license its font technology, but itsrasterizer is limited to a Sparc architecture.andP;  SGI's handling of DisplayPostScript on top of X will be similar in concept to IBM's Display PostScriptoffering for the RS/6000, which also runs on top of X.andM;3D Type 1 fonts.andP;  What does Display PostScript on a hot, 3D modeling platformgive you that you can't get on your average color workstation with DisplayPostScript?andP;  The answer is 3D Type 1 fonts with real-time environmentmapping.andP;  It is fast, and it is slick.andM;SGI demonstrated its ability to transform a Type 1 outline font into athree-dimensional incarnation of itself that can be scaled, rotated andenvironmentally mapped, which means you can give the rendered font theproperties of, say, silver, and reflect from it the surrounding &quot;environment&quot;(e.g., the inside of a British pub).andP;  Neat stuff, with potential applicationsin both visual computing (special effects, titling, etc.) and traditionalgraphic arts applications.andM;SGI also demonstrated Frame 2.0 in color running on a Personal Iris and aserendipitous paint program that allows you to select from a variety ofgeometric patterns when airbrushing images, with the ability to vary thedirection and speed of the brushes.andP;  SGI plans to bundle the software in itsnext operating system release, due in the first half of next year.andP;  (DisplayPostScript will also be available with this release.)andM;Sun Microsystems shows third partiesandM;Sun Microsystems, like most hardware vendors, has taken to showing offthird-party applications in its trade show exhibits.andP;  Sun workstationscontinue to be the most popular Unix platform for new publishingapplications, which we cover elsewhere in this issue.andM;The most significant new product from Sun was its NewsPrint architecture bywhich it will bundle with every Sparcstation a PostScript rasterizer thatdrives both screen and output devices.andP;  NewsPrint is covered under&quot;Rasterizers&quot; in the Output section of this issue.andM;Dux's Quintet.andP;  Dux, a California developer and distributor of Unix software,is a new face in the industry.andP;  Its first product, Quintet, is an integratedsuite of business applications for general-purpose use.andM;Quintet runs within OpenWindows and is consistent with the Open Lookgraphical user interface.andP;  Although Sun is the only platform for whichQuintet is presently available, the company intends to port its software toother platforms.andM;The product, due out this month, comprises a word processor, a personaldatabase, a spreadsheet, a business graphics package and a communicationsmodule that handles remote communications or emulates dumb terminals.andO;Essentially a unified suite of software modules, these elements can bedynamically linked (at the choice of the user) so that changes to thespreadsheet are reflected in other components that incorporate the data.andO;Single-cell spreadsheet data may be embedded into a text file, for example,so that references are always current.andM;The package has import and export functions within the database and wordprocessors.andP;  Database import and export has to be dBase compatible.andP;  Quintetcan import and export WordStar, Microsoft Word and WordPerfect (i.e., ASCII)files.andP;  Currently, Quintet is a single-user package, although there are plansto develop a multiuser version.andP;  The company also has plans to interface withother products within Open Look, such as FrameMaker.andM;Quintet is priced as a &quot;horizontal productivity tool&quot;--$995, with anintroductory price of $895.andM;IPT's uShare.andP;  UShare is a network server that provides a means of hookingPCs or Macs on Unix networks.andP;  It is available in two forms: anSBus/LocalTalk board and an IPT LocalTalk interface card for the PC.andP;  It canconnect LocalTalk into the Sun network with either LocalTalk or Ethernet,obviating the need for FastPath or similar gateway boxes.andP;  The productimplements an AMD 2130 dual-ported static memory chip and runs at 230kilobits per second.andP;  The card costs $595; the printer software for LocalTalkadds $300.andP;  The package is available now.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
