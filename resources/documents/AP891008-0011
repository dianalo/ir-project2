Scores were arrested and dozens injured by police who punched,kicked, beat and dragged away protesters in East Berlin and atleast three other cities, witnesses and television reports said.One Western journalist reportedly was detained.   An estimated 10,000 people joined the protests.   Some 5,000 demonstrators, many shouting ``Gorby, Gorby,''crowded into the Alexanderplatz square in East Berlin lateSaturday. The Soviet leader, whose reform policies have made him ahero to many East Germans, ended his two-day visit Saturday eveningand headed back to Moscow.   Plainclothes police and uniformed riot officers used force todisperse the East Berlin demonstrators.   Police bashed one man's head against a wall. Other protesterswere kicked by security police, dragged along the ground to sidestreets and taken away to jails.   Some East Berlin residents watched the violence from apartmentwindows. They waved sparklers to show support for the demonstrators.   Catherine Field, a reporter for the British newspaper Observer,earlier said authorities detained three Western journalists. But aspokesman for NBC later said only Peter Millar of the Sunday Timesof London was held. The report could not be confirmed with EastGerman authorities.      In the most widespread protests to hit East Germany in years,clashes also were reported in Leipzig, Dresden and Potsdam.   Also Saturday, West Germany's foreign minister said there weresigns East Germany would ease emigration restrictions. A WestGerman newspaper said the plans were intended to clear out thosewho have criticized conditions in their Communist homeland.   The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans has deeplyembarrassed the aging leadership in East Berlin during weekendanniversary celebrations.   However, the official East German news agency ADN said that inthree hours of talks, Honecker told Gorbachev East Germany willadhere to ``the basic values'' of socialism.   ``The hopes of bourgeois politicians and ideologues who areaiming for reforms heading to bourgeois democracy and on tocapitalism are built on sand,'' Honecker was quoted as saying.   ``The Socialist Unity Party will consistently follow the provencourse for the good of the people, in the unity of economic andsocial policies, continuity and renewal,'' he said.   While making clear his aims for communist East Germany, Honeckeralso expressed support for the Soviet Union's reforms.   ADN said the meeting took place in an atmosphere of``traditional friendship.''   A day earlier, Gorbachev urged Warsaw Pact ally East Germany towork with ``all forces in society.''   Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry,said Gorbachev repeated to Honecker a Russian saying that ``he whois late is punished.''   Asked whether that referred to the East German government'srepeated rejection of reforms, Gerasimov said: ``No, we weretalking about our experiences. But journalists do interpretthings.''   Gerasimov said the issue of the refugee exodus did not come upin the session he attended, the second of two.   About 4,000 protesters battled police Saturday in Leipzig,according to witnesses and West Germany's ZDF television network.The witnesses said there were numerous injuries and arrests but itwas not clear how many.   Police, carrying truncheons and wearing riot helmets andshields, waded into the crowd of protesters and beat them atrandom, witnesses said.   Groups of 10 to 15 policemen were seen chasing demonstrators,who offered no resistance but shouted ``No violence,'' ``Shame onyou'' and ``Gorbachev, Gorbachev!'' the witnesses said.   About 2,000 demonstrators battled police and soldiers overnightin Dresden and an unspecified number were injured, witnesses said.It was the fourth night of violence in Dresden.   Hundreds of police officers attacked the demonstrators, whoresponded by hurling bottles and other objects, witnesses said.They said the street battles lasted for several hours.   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher saidSaturday in a TV interview there were signals East Berlin was aboutto ease emigration restrictions for its citizens.   The West German Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported that EastBerlin was planning ``a massive expulsion of annoying citizens.'   It is thought that more than a million people have asked toleave East Germany, although the government has not provided anystatistics.   Western tourists were barred from Communist East Berlin for athird day. New barriers were put up overnight at the CheckpointCharlie crossing.   A disturbance broke out at the checkpoint Saturday when a manwith a crowbar hacked and hammered at the new metal barriers fromthe Western side.   A crowd of about 200 people on the western side taunted EastGerman guards watching the disturbance, and pelted them with piecesof metal, cans and clumps of dirt. The guards did not react.   Tanks, rocket transporters and goose-stepping East Germansoldiers paraded down East Berlin's Karl Marx Boulevard earlySaturday in a celebration of East Germany's founding on Oct. 7,1949. Gorbachev and Honecker observed the military display.   The military nature of the parade drew a protest from Westernallies Britain, France and the United States, who called it a``provocation as well as a violation of the city's demilitarizedstatus.''   ADN said the parade showed the country's determination ``toalways protect what the workers have produced in four decades.''   But the government had difficulty portraying the nation as asocialist success.   More than 47,000 people have fled East Germany sincemid-September, across Hungary's western border or through WestGerman embassies in Czechoslovakia and Poland. Many have complainedof repression and a low standard of living.   Bavarian border police said Saturday that 662 East Germanrefugees arrived in the West German state over the past 24 hours,all through Hungary. Budapest opened the border Sept. 11.</TEXT></DOC>
