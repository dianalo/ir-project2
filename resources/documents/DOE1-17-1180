Reduced dead load also increases temperatures in the lower furnace,providing many advantages, including decreased total reduced sulphuremissions and a higher reduction efficiency. Boiler thermal efficiencyis improved. It was estimated that by applying a process based on partialevaporation of white liquor, the capacity of one Babcock and Wilcox boilercould be increased by about 7%. A portion of this increase could be achievedby other process measures directed at increasing the causticizing andreduction efficiency. 19 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
