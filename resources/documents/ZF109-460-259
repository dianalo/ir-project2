 Too often, grand totalformulas look like this:andM;+R27+R38+R59+R82+R101+R111+R125andM;Entering such a formula is tedious and dangerous because it's easy to miss asubtotal.andP;  If you add or delete a section, you have to change the formula.andO;There's a simpler way.andP;  Consider this example:andM;A                BandM;1 SECTION AandM;2 NBR 1                 104.00andM;3 NBR 2                 239.34andM;4 NBR 3                 851.07andM;5                       ------andM;6 TOTAL A:              1,194.41andM;7andM;8 SECTION BandM;9 NBR 1                 456.78andM;10 NBR 2                987.65andM;11 NBR 3                12.34andM;12 NBR 4                567.89andM;13                      ------andM;14 TOTAL B:             2,024.66andM;15andM;16andM;17 GRAND TOTAL:         3,219.07andM;Here, the grand total can be calculated by using the simple formula@SUM(B2..B14)/2.andP;  When you add or delete sections, the grand total formulawill be adjusted.andP;  For this formula to work, however, you must have asubtotal for each section.andM;dBaseandM;Printing LabelsandM;The following dBASE III program tends to a lot of the details of printinglabels.andP;  The program is written for a LaserJet II but can be adapted to otherpopular printers by substituting the control codes those printers requireafter CHR(27) + in lines 2 through 4.andP;  You don't have to bother including thelines that begin with asterisks; they simply explain what the lines followingthem do.andP;  The program assumes that you have already set up the .LBL file withthe CREATE LABEL command.andP;  Replace the filename variable with the name ofyour .LBL form.andM;SET DEVICE TO PRINTandM;* Reset printerandM;@ 0,0 SAY CHR(27) + &quot;E&quot;andM;* Set top margin to 2andM;@ 0,0 SAY CHR(27) + &quot;andamp;12E&quot;andM;* Set text length to 60andM;@ 0,0 SAY CHR(27) + &quot;andamp;160F&quot;andM;SET DEVICE TO SCREENandM;LABEL FORM filename TO PRINTandM;* Eject last pageandM;EJECTandM;SET DEVICE TO PRINTandM;* Reset printerandM;@ 0,0 SAY CHR(27) + &quot;E&quot;andM;SET DEVICE TO SCREENandM;WordPerfectandM;Saving for E-mailandM;WordPerfect makes it easy to create messages and documents to be uploaded toMCI and other telecommunications services.andP;  Just follow a few rules to makesure your documents are received properly.andM;Most terminal software supports only 80 columns of characters, so be sureyour margins are set for less than 80 columns of text.andP;  Set your fonts to 10pitch; if you set them to 12 pitch, your document may be too wide to read onthe receiving screen.andP;  If you're sending a telex, set your margins to 69characters per column, the standard width for telex terminals.andM;In general, a file saved by pressing F10 shouldn't be transmitted.andP;  Thesefiles contain WordPerfect internal codes, including graphics and fancy fonts,that won't travel on systems that accept only ASCII files.andP;  But if you'resending a file on services, such as MCI Mail, that permit attached files, andyou and the recipient are using Lotus Express, you can send graphics and allthe formatting your original WordPerfect document includes.andM;In Express, you create your envelope as usual, include any message you wantand then press F10, File and Attach, followed by the filename.andP;  The recipientunattaches the document by typing F10, File, Save and Attachment and gives ita filename.andM;If you're not using MCI Mail and Lotus Express, save the file as a DOS textfile by pressing Ctrl-F5.andP;  Don't save it as a &quot;generic&quot; text file; this willmake the lines too long for most systems.andM;If you want to include some formatting from your WordPerfect document, suchas headers or page numbering, print to disk.andP;  For WordPerfect 5.0 or later,change the output for the printer setting from either the parallel or serialport to  Other,&quot; that is, a filename.andP;  Press Shift-F7, Select, Edit, Port,Other.andP;  Printing to disk creates a file with all non-ASCII codes removed, butpreserves special features such as indents, columns, margins, tables ofcontents and indexes.andM;Q andamp; AandM;Print Multiple Mailing LabelsandM;Want to print out multiple copies of a single mailing label with Qandamp;A Write?andO;It can't be done with normal Qandamp;A File functions, but here are a couple ofworkarounds.andM;Design a document in Qandamp;A Write that's the size of your mailing label stock.andO;For example, 3 1/2-by-15/16-inch labels are equivalent to 35 columns by sixlines, assuming six lines per inch and a 10-pitch font.andP;  Set top and bottommargins to zero.andP;  Type the text of the label in the Write screen.andP;  At thePrint Options screen, fill in the &quot;Number of Copies&quot; prompt and press F10 tostart printing.andM;You can also trick Qandamp;A into printing multiple labels by entering a dummy specat the label layout screen in File.andP;  When Qandamp;A displays the field names forthe current database, type over them, deleting the asterisks and entering thetext you want to print on your labels.andP;  Next, at the &quot;Name of Merge File&quot;prompt in the Print Options screen, enter the name of a database that has atleast as many forms as you want to print.andP;  When Qandamp;A has printed the number oflabels you want, turn off your printer and press Esc to tell Qandamp;A to abandonthe print run.andM;Microsoft WordandM;Date Letters AutomaticallyandM;You may already have a glossary entry in Microsoft Word to put your returnaddress at the top of a letter.andP;  With a small addition to that glossary, youcan have Word enter the correct date when you print a letter.andM;On the line after the street and city lines in your glossary entry, put theword date by itself:andM;1600 Pennsylvania Ave.andM;Washington, D.C.andM;dateandM;Then press F3.andP;  Whenever you type the letter or the name of the glossaryentry and press F3 twice, the return address will appear in your letter withthe current date.andM;WindowsandM;A Timely iconandM;Here's a way that you can always see what time it is when you're working in aWindows application-without fooling with the cumbersome default clockdisplay.andM;Double-click on the Accessories icon and then double-click on Clock.andP;  Clickon Settings, then on Digital, and then use the Minimize command to reduce theclock display.andP;  This places a relatively small, easy-to-read, working digitalclock icon at the bottom of your windows display.andP;  Of course, you can useyour mouse to drag the clock icon anywhere you like.andM;ProcommandM;Track Session TimeandM;When you're connected to an online service with Procomm, pressing Alt-T callsup a window that display? the time elapsed in the current session.andP;  Sincemost services charge by the minute, knowing how long you've been connectedhelps keep your costs down.andM;XyWriteandM;Fixing Printer ErrorsandM;Some printers generate minor error messages that stop XyWrite III Plus deadin its tracks, causing an inexplicable &quot;Printer Error&quot; message to appear onyour screen.andP;  If this happens, try opening your printer file and adding anNE=1 default setting at the top of the file.andP;  This tells XyWrite not to cheekfor printer status and to proceed with the job at hand.andM;Be sure to annotate your addition to the printer file by including a secondNE=1 statement with a semicolon in front of it.andP;  The semicolon tells XyWriteto ignore the text that follows, which can describe what the NE setting isfor.andP;  Keeping track of your changes to printer and keyboard files withsemicolons this way reminds you what such cryptic statements as NE do.andP;  Thistechnique is useful in case you need to troubleshoot the file later.andM;Microsoft ExcelandM;Faster LoopingandM;Microsoft Excel's FOR loops can be helpful when used in complex macros, butthey can also be slow.andP;  The following is a portion of macro code thataccomplishes the same thing that a FOR loop does, but performs faster in mostsituations:andM;=SET,VALUE(A2,0)andM;=IF(A2andgt;49,GOTO(END),A2+1)andM;Include loop action hereandM;=GOTO(A2)andM;ENDandM;As written in the example above, the code creates a 49-iteration loopbeginning in cell Al of the macro sheet.andP;  To adapt the code to your ownmacros, change the cell address and the number of iterations, which is set inthis example at 49 in the second line, following IF(A2andgt;.andM;Microsoft WorksandM;Reset Date and TimeandM;You can use the Set Date andamp; Time function found within Microsoft Works 2.0 tochange the date and time settings recorded in your PC's system clock.andP;  It'seasier than relying on the CMOS Setup program that many computers use tocorrect date and time settings when they go awry.andM;To modify your system clock with Works, press Alt-F to access the Files menuand then press F to select File Management.andP;  Select Date andamp; Time.andP;  Enter thecorrect date and/or time and select OK.andP;  Select OK a second time from theFile Management option box to record the changes and return to your Workssession.andM;Ventura PublisherandM;Backtrack Dialog BoxesandM;A useful Ventura shortcut uses the Ctrl-X key combination to redisplay themost recently used dialog box.andP;  This saves time and eliminates the need toreselect menus and respecify menu options to repeat the last operation youperformed.andP;  For example, Ctrl-X is especially helpful when you're trying todetermine the best cropping and sizing for an imported graphic.andM;Printing OverlaysandM;Some overhead transparencies are designed to be overlaid, one on top of theother, during a presentation.andP;  For example, the first overlay might show thebar chart representing last year's sales volume by quarter, and a secondoverlay would add the bars that represent target sales volumes for thecurrent or the coming year.andM;Instead of creating two separate images and printing them, hoping that theelements will coincide, create the composite image on a single page and usePageMaker's color feature to assign a different color to the elements on eachoverlay.andP;  For example, make the title, axes, tick marks, axis label set ofbars black, and make the second set of bars and any added labels anothercolor.andM;When you print the set on a black-and-white printer with the Spot Colorseparation option, the two images will print on separate sheets.andP;  Note thatin this example the two sets of bars would have to be drawn as two separategraphics before importing them into PageMaker.andP;  If you create them as asingle graphic, PageMaker can't separate the colors assigned in othergraphics applications.andP;  Note also that the second overlay in this case doesnot repeat the axes, tick marks and labels of the first overlay.andM;If you're not using a color printer, add colors with film or gel paint for astriking effect.andP;  You can use this technique to create color overlays on acolor printer, provided that each overlay is one color.andP;  You can't have morethan one color on each sheet of acetate if you want to use PageMaker's SpotColor separation feature to create the overlays.andM;SideKickandM;Use WordStar with SideKickandM;Since SideKick uses WordStar commands, the memory-resident program is anatural for use with the word processor.andP;  Since WordStar won't let you callup more than one document at a time, you can use SideKick's Notepad to pop upa second WordStar document over the one that you're already working with.andO;However, if you use this trick, you'll need to know about a quirk inWordStar's file format that will affect SideKick.andM;When storing text, WordStar replaces &quot;standalone&quot; characters-those with aspace before and after them-and the final letter of each word with 8-bitcharacters.andP;  Specifically, it uses 8-bit characters with an ASCII value thatis 128 more than the value of the displayed character.andP;  For example, theletter &quot;r,&quot; which equals ASCII 114, is really stored as &quot;andgt;&quot; (ASCII 242).andO;That means that the name &quot;WordStar&quot; would actually be stored as &quot;WordStaandgt;.&quot;andO;(To see this in action, enter the command TYPE filename at the DOS prompt,where filename stands for a WordStar file.)andM;SideKick doesn't display these 8-bit characters; instead, it strips theirhigh bits and displays them as the original 7-bit characters.andP;  However,SideKick's Find function sees only the 8-bit characters, so if you enter&quot;WordStar&quot; at the Find prompt, SideKick will search the file and ignore allthe instances of &quot;WordStar&quot; that are really &quot;WordStaandgt;&quot; in disguise.andM;To avoid this type of problem, don't use the final character of a word in asearch string.andP;  And locate a standalone character by checking the value ofthe displayed character on SideKick's ASCII chart and adding 128 to thatvalue.andP;  Hold down the Alt key and use the numeric keypad to enter the numberat the Find prompt.andP;  For example, to find the letter &quot;r,&quot; you would enter thesearch string Alt-242.andP;  Similarly, to find &quot;7&quot; as a standalone character,enter the string Alt-135.andM;If you have a secret way to make popular software easier, faster or morepowerful, send it to Software Secrets, PC/Computing, Four Cambridge Center,Cambridge, Mass.andP;
