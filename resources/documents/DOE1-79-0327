The research described is motivatedby the direct interpretation model used to narrow the sequential semanticgap. The direct implementation of an interpreter on some multiprocessororganization is proposed. The specific approach is to study syntax-directedinterpretation on a binary-tree multiprocessor organization. Two newrecognition algorithms for a binary-tree multiprocessor are presented,and application of these algorithms to parallel interpretation are studied.Language interpretation is not the only application which these algorithmshave. Compelling research directions are suggested for architecturessupporting expert systems and complex pattern analysis. Included amongthese are machines for information retrieval from a semantic-networkknowledge base and ones which perform scene analysis by detecting graphisomorphisms.</TEXT></DOC>
