Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.) declined tocomment on the committee's deliberation. But separately,those individuals said it reflected increased concern aboutthe direction of U.S. policy in Cambodia as well as a desireto invite more public debate on the issue.</LP><TEXT>   The decision follows a House vote Wednesday to continue anovert program of non-lethal assistance to the forces. Inrecent years, intelligence committees in both chambers haveexpressed growing concern over the wisdom of using covertoperations to sustain secret aid programs long after theirexistence is known publicly.   In the past decade, the Central Intelligence Agency hasbeen used to provide covert U.S. aid to forces fighting inregional conflicts in Angola, Afghanistan and Nicaragua, forexample, and critics argue that the result is often thesuppression of debate on Washington's policy.   In the case of Cambodia, the continuing assistance fromthe U.S. has drawn criticism because of the brutal history ofthe Khmer Rouge when it took over Cambodia in the 1970s.Although restrictions prohibit any assistance to the KhmerRouge, the forces backed by the U.S. are part of a politicalcoalition with the Pol Pot guerrillas against the governmentinstalled by the Vietnamese.   This sensitivity was underscored in the House debate thisweek. To win support for the $7 million in overt aid,proponents specified that all assistance would be nonlethal,and new restrictions were imposed in response to criticismthat the insurgents are mounting operations in cooperationwith the Khmer Rouge.   Intelligence sources said the non-communist forces areless military than political, and proponents of the programargue that the U.S. therefore has an interest in sustainingthe forces as an alternative between the Khmer Rouge and theHanoi-backed government. By the same token, this goal mightbe better accomplished through overt assistance, and theHouse debate this week indicated that intelligence membersthere appeared more comfortable with an open program than theone under their jurisdiction.   The covert aid, believed to have begun in the early 1980s,is said to have included logistical support and militarytraining. For a time, the program was operated through thegovernment of Thailand.   The Senate committee action came as part of closed-doordeliberations on the fiscal 1991 authorization bill coveringthe CIA's budget. A House panel isn't expected to begin workon its version of the bill until after the July Fourthrecess.</TEXT></DOC>
