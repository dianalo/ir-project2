In this contribution, an overview of Cray supercomputersystems is presented for both the CRAY X-MP and the CRAY-2 line. First,the discussion focuses on hardware issues: (1) intrinsic processor speed,(2) memory size and speed, (3) I/O capabilities, (4) parallelism (i.e.vectorization and multiprocessing), and (5) networking. Next, the questionsof operating systems and languages are addressed. The match between presenttheoretical/computational approaches and Cray systems is shown for specificexamples in molecular, solid-state, and biological systems. Furthermore,chemistry, by its very nature, not only is a matter of numerical processing,but has essential aspects amenable to graphic and symbolic processing.Therefore, one section of this talk is devoted to the relationship betweenthese non-numerical aspects and the capabilities of supercomputers. Large-scalecomputations, particularly in the fields of biochemistry and materialsscience, are rapidly becoming crucial for industrial research. This requiresdeveloping more powerful approaches and algorithms that allow one tosimulate and study more complex systems closer to reality. Thus, thelast part of this presentation discusses future hardware and softwaretrends and their impact on computational chemistry.</TEXT></DOC>
