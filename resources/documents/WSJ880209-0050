PETERSBURG, Fla.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Florida Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association is under investigation by federal authorities for allegedly filing fraudulent insurance claims on millions of dollars in government-backed student loans.    In addition, the troubled thrift announced a management shake-up -- partly triggered by the student loan imbroglio -- that included the resignation of its chairman, chief executive officer and president, Eric Stattin. Florida Federal also reported a loss of $17.3 million for its first six months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $18.6 million, including extraordinary charges totaling $14.4 million, a year earlier.    Florida Federal also said it could face steep losses because of tightened rules on collection procedures on government-guaranteed student loans. Those rules, adopted last year because the government thinks some lenders don't try hard enough to collect before cashing in on the guarantees, have caused a furor among banks and thrifts. The rules also could sharply curtail lending under the Education Department's guaranteed student loan program, many lenders have said.    As much as $100 million of Florida Federal's defaulted student loans don't meet the new requirements, a spokeswoman said. She said much of that amount could conceivably wind up as losses unless the rules are relaxed.    Florida Federal has $684 million of student loans and is the third largest participant in the program, which provides about $10 billion a year in guaranteed loans. Under the program, lenders with defaulted student loans are required to undertake and document a series of collection efforts, including phone calls and letters, before filing claims with state or multistate agencies, which act as the first guarantors for the loans. The agencies reimburse the banks and are later reimbursed by the government.    According to company and law enforcement officials, Florida Federal submitted claims between November 1986 and July 1987 on which it asserted it had followed the collection procedures when in fact it hadn't. &quot;Our people said they'd made the calls, and they hadn't,&quot; the Florida Federal spokeswoman said.    The spokeswoman said the thrift filed claims on 19,000 loans totaling $44 million during the period, but hadn't determined how many claims contained false collection data. However, a federal law enforcement official said nearly all of the claims did. He also called the case the largest alleged fraud of its kind.    Florida Federal, which uncovered the alleged fraud and reported it to authorities, hasn't yet determined how large a loss it would incur because of the faulty claims, the spokeswoman said.    Both the Education Department's inspector general and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are conducting investigations. An Education Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the case, but the law enforcement official said fraudulent collection practices can, under some circumstances, lead to criminal or civil charges.    The Florida Federal spokeswoman said the thrift's top management didn't know about the loan practices and moved swiftly to correct them up when they came to light. Still, the problems contributed to the resignation of the 53-year-old Mr. Stattin, a highly regarded thrift executive who joined Florida Federal in 1985 and became chairman in September 1986. Florida Federal already was in grim shape because of poor real estate loans, and Mr. Stattin's efforts to turn the thrift around or to find a buyer haven't worked.    Florida Federal said Mr. Stattin will be succeeded as president and chief executive by Garth Marston, 62, a former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. James Healey, 68, retired chairman of Milton Roy Co., was named chairman.    For the first quarter ended Dec. 31, Florida Federal had a loss of $11.6 million, compared with a loss of $11.4 million, including extraordinary charges of $14.2 million, a year earlier. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Florida Federal closed at $3.75 a share, down 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
