Now, after revelations of an immense stock manipulation stretching from Wall Street to Switzerland, the City's lightheartedness is gone. Parts of the current regulatory system may soon follow.    In a remarkable letter to shareholders on Friday, Guinness PLC said that two of its directors had signed agreements that the liquor and brewing company &quot;could not lawfully have fulfilled&quot; to induce Bank Leu AG of Switzerland to buy Guinness shares. The share purchases, coming at the height of last spring's takeover fight for Distillers Co., raised the value of Guinness shares and thus of its acquisition offer. Guinness narrowly defeated a rival bidder and won Distillers for the equivalent of $3.84 billion.    In addition, Guinness said Friday that it couldn't account for the equivalent of $38 million in fees paid to unidentified parties. The company said it suspects the money may have gone &quot;in return for share buying activity in support of the Distillers bid.&quot;    In Zurich, Bank Leu acknowledged the share-buying deals, in which the bank was indemnified against loss by Guinness. Bank Leu -- whose Bahamian unit handled the Dennis Levine insider trades that put U.S. investigators on the trail of Ivan Boesky -- said it held a stake of about 5%, or 41 million shares, of Guinness, valued at $168 million.    Bank Leu wasn't alone. Orchestrated buying of Guinness shares now is thought to have involved at least a dozen parties and up to 70 million Guinness shares, valued at the current equivalent of $380 million. As in most British takeovers, Guinness's takeover bid was mainly priced in its own shares.    The Guinness letter and Bank Leu's statements are the latest of several bombshells to go off since the British government disclosed its investigation of Guinness on Dec. 1. Since then, Guinness's board has fired its dominating chairman and chief executive, Ernest Saunders, demanded the resignations of two directors, and disclosed a series of questionable share deals and investments in both the U.S. and Europe. After a period of rapid expansion, Guinness now faces write-offs it still can't tally, potentially debilitating lawsuits and, in its weakened position, the possibility of being taken over itself.    But the reverberations are spreading far beyond Guinness. Anxiety runs high that prominent British securities firms will be implicated in the scandal. Just three months after gaining new operating freedom in London's &quot;big bang&quot; financial deregulation, brokers and bankers fear they will be saddled with other restrictions. Pressure for tighter rules governing takeover practices seems irresistible. And lawmakers of all stripes are calling for a government securities commission to replace the industry self-policing body scheduled to begin work later this year.    The Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is also beginning to take its lumps. In an anti-City mood, Tory members of Parliament last week joined the opposition legislators to object to the government's decision not to delay or review BTR PLC's $1.76 billion bid for Pilkington Brothers PLC. Leading Tories predict that if Mrs. Thatcher doesn't act soon to rein in the City, the issue will be a political liability in national elections expected this year.    The prevailing feeling in Britain, right or wrong, is that financial operators are getting away with murder while factories are closing and three million people, or 12% of the work force, are unemployed. The City, said one senior Tory during the Pilkington debate, seems &quot;long on cunning and short on morals.&quot;    &quot;This is one issue where the long-term interests of the City are not the same as the long-term interests of the country,&quot; says Anthony Beaumont-Dark, a Conservative member of Parliament who is also a stockbroker. &quot;The government has got to adopt a policy that says we haven't entered the age of the predator, where a corporation taking over another can do anything it wants.&quot;    The Guinness investigation is only one of about a half-dozen inquiries -- most for possible insider trading -- begun by the government or the London Stock Exchange since Oct. 27, when the last deregulatory step took place in the markets. Now, &quot;nobody is talking to anyone, and people are worried that all their phone conversations are being recorded,&quot; says James Devas, a trader at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. &quot;The public is crying for blood, especially up north, where people are out of jobs.&quot;    There are sure to be further shock waves. More resignations are expected at Guinness and possibly Morgan Grenfell andamp; Co., a Guinness adviser in the Distillers takeover. Still not fully explained are Mr. Saunders's role and Guinness's links to Mr. Boesky, who in November settled charges of securities-trading violations in the U.S. Mr. Boesky is widely believed to have provided the evidence that led Britain to open its investigation of Guinness.    From what is already known, however, the Guinness case provides ample evidence that the era of the global stock market has brought with it the era of global stock-market shenanigans. The U.K. government is known to be seeking information from, besides Guinness and Bank Leu, 10 British concerns and two U.S. securities firms -- Drexel Burnham Lambert and L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co.    According to Guinness's statements and to accounts of those who worked on the Distillers bid and its aftermath, Guinness's share price was kept artificially high by a complex series of transactions directed from London but involving buyers in New York, Zurich and elsewhere.    In some cases, Guinness or its advisers secretly guaranteed investors that if they bought Guinness shares, the stock would be repurchased at a later date by the company at no loss to the investors. Some have alleged that the company used its own funds to carry out the buying program. British law makes it illegal for a company to pay for its own shares, or compensate others to buy them, without first gaining its shareholders' approval.    Under a new chairman named a week ago, Sir Norman Macfarlane, Guinness is trying to make a fresh start. Its board, after dismissing Mr. Saunders, sought and obtained the resignation of one of its members, Arthur Furer, who had been named to the board by Mr. Saunders and is Bank Leu's chairman. In addition, the board has asked another Saunders protege, U.S. lawyer Thomas Ward, to resign as a director. Olivier Roux, the company's finance director and a key strategist in the Distillers battle, stepped down last week.    It was a year ago this week that Guinness made its move for Distillers, Britain's largest maker of Scotch whisky, offering to be the rescuing white knight after Distillers drew a hostile bid from Argyll Group PLC. Guinness had on its side the cream of Britain's takeover advisers -- merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, with its aggressive acquisitions specialist Roger Seelig; blueblood stockbrokers Cazenove and Co.; and Freshfields, one of Britain's top two corporate law firms.    Mr. Saunders brought two others into his &quot;war cabinet,&quot; as Guinness called it. They were Mr. Roux, on loan from Boston management consultants Bain andamp; Co., and Mr. Ward, a lawyer with the Washington law firm of Ward, Lazarus, Grow andamp; Cihlar. During Mr. Saunders's tenure as a marketing official at Nestle SA, Mr. Ward had helped him direct the giant Swiss company's counterattack against church and relief groups opposed to its marketing of infant formula in the Third World.    The war cabinet now is in disarray. Besides the Guinness departures, Mr. Seelig has resigned from Morgan Grenfell, under pressure because of his activities in the Distillers bid.    But while it lasted, the takeover team's name was apt. For Guinness, the prize was so glittering -- a company twice its size, with some of the world's best-known Scotch and spirits labels -- that Mr. Saunders and his inner circle were prepared to go to great lengths to win. By March of last year, the Guinness bid had received clearance from the U.K. government, and the bitterly contested battle for Distillers entered its final, critical stage.    It was between March 21 and April 18, the closing date of both the Guinness and the Argyll offers, that a flood of Guinness buy orders hit the London market, raising the Guinness share price by 25% and the value of the bid by almost that much. The main brokers handling the deluge were Cazenove; the Wood Mackenzie unit of Hill Samuel Group PLC; and Alexanders Laing andamp; Cruikshank, a part of Mercantile House Holdings PLC. All are in London.    On the closing date, with Guinness's bid valued at just a few pence more than Argyll's, Guinness received acceptances from more than 50% of the Distillers holders and won the contest. Argyll said Friday that it was considering suing Guinness. &quot;Cazenove was telling the market that it had a lot of buying power in Guinness,&quot; says one source who was in the Argyll camp. &quot;They were giving the impression that it would be foolish not to accept the Guinness offer.&quot;    Cazenove and the other two brokers have declined to discuss their share-buying activities.    Just who all the buyers were and how large the buying was remain unclear. But in addition to Bank Leu, acknowledged buyers so far include Rapid-American Corp., the U.S. retailer and liquor distributor controlled by Meshulam Riklis; the MIM Britannia unit of Britannia Arrow Holdings PLC; and companies run by British newspaper publisher Robert Maxwell. Rapid-American has declined to answer questions about its share buying; MIM and Mr. Maxwell have denied that their sharebuying was in any way indemnified by Guinness.    Among the biggest buyers, brokers say, was Rapid-American. It is the parent of Schenley Industries, which owned profitable U.S. distribution rights from Distillers for Dewar's Scotch.    In December, after Britain's Department of Trade and Industry opened the Guinness investigation, Rapid-American said it had bought Guinness shares during the bid. The company acquired 17.6 million shares, more than 5% of Guinness's outstanding stock at the time, without disclosing its purchases, although British law requires disclosure at the 5% level. In a letter to Guinness last month in which it told of the stake, Rapid-American said it had been unaware of the requirement. The British government has declined to say whether it will take any action against Rapid-American on the disclosure issue.    Rapid-American has made no further public comment but continues to be at the center of the controversy here. Recently, it acquired both the Dewar's trademark and the right to distribute another well-known Distillers product, Gordon's gin, in the U.S.    Guinness sources say the company is trying to determine whether any of the mislaid $38 million went to the New York company and whether any of the share buying by Rapid-American was in exchange for the concessions on Gordon's or Dewar's. Guinness has said that the Dewar's trademark was transferred to Schenley on the advice of Ward Lazarus -- Mr. Ward's law firm -- which thought the brand would be better protected against imported look-alikes if the trademark holder was American. Mr. Ward has declined to be interviewed.    Guinness also is trying to determine whether the Dewar's distribution contract, renegotiated with Schenley by Ward Lazarus on Guinness's behalf last year, contained terms more favorable to Schenley than the previous contract. Sir Norman, the new Guinness chairman, conceded in his letter to holders that Guinness still doesn't know all the circumstances surrounding the share buying.    Says one Guinness source: &quot;We still don't have the whole picture. It's like a jigsaw puzzle with 75% of the pieces on the table, but the border is still missing.&quot;    Part of the problem is a large number of Guinness shares held in &quot;nominee&quot; accounts -- whereby a financial concern holds the shares on behalf of an owner in an account that uses a third name. Guinness sources say the company and the Department of Trade and Industry, which is conducting the government's investigation, suspect that funds under Mr. Boesky's management were prominent buyers using nominee accounts.    A disclosure that shocked some of Guinness's newer outside directors, and led them to take action against Mr. Saunders, is that Guinness made a $100 million investment last May in Ivan F. Boesky Limited Partners, Mr. Boesky's main arbitrage fund. The investment wasn't disclosed until after the investigation began in December.    Morgan Grenfell says Mr. Seelig lined up buyers who took on 13 million shares. One was Henry J. Ansbacher andamp; Co., a small British merchant bank, which says it bought 2.1 million shares for clients in a nominee account called Down Holdings. Another was L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., which, according to Morgan Grenfell, bought 5.9 million shares of Guinness that Morgan Grenfell repurchased after the bid.    L.F. Rothschild has acknowledged being asked by the government to furnish trading records but has declined further comment. Ansbacher, however, has had a public dispute with Guinness over the block of 2.1 million shares. The merchant bank says that after the bid, it used an $11.5 million transfer of funds from Guinness to repurchase the shares from clients at an above-market price, at the direction of Morgan Grenfell. Guinness contends the money was merely a &quot;deposit&quot; and has demanded its return by tomorrow.    But the biggest buyer of all appears to have been Bank Leu. Eager to strike up a relationship with Guinness, the Swiss bank says it tried in vain to make progress until April 1986, when Guinness called on it to help out in the Distillers bid. Based on indemnity agreements signed by Mr. Roux and Mr. Ward, Guinness says, the bank bought both Guinness and Distillers shares during the bid and, at Guinness's request, bought Guinness shares again after the merger. Neither Guinness nor Bank Leu will say how many of the 41 million Guinness shares Bank Leu now holds were bought during the bid.    When Guinness asked for further share buying in May, Bank Leu asked for and received a $76 million deposit that could be used to defray any losses from its market position. Guinness and Bank Leu worked together to arrange a placing of the bank's Guinness shares with foreign investors, but the British government investigation began before it could be completed.    In November, a Bank Leu analyst issued a buy recommendation in Guinness's stock, without disclosing that the bank owned a substantial Guinness stake.    The bank said Friday that &quot;it is fair to state that all transactions consummated by our group were normal business activities in compliance with applicable Swiss law.&quot; The bank said it didn't know about the British legal implications of helping Guinness and said it had &quot;no cause to doubt&quot; that Guinness's directors had &quot;been duly informed of the transactions.&quot;    Asked why Mr. Furer, the Bank Leu chairman who was a Guinness director until Friday, didn't inform the bank that the Guinness directors hadn't been told, Adolph Braendle, a Bank Leu spokesman, said the bank maintains a &quot;strict&quot; separation between its commercial activities and its own officials' directorships.    What has some British politicians fuming is that the frantic, and possibly illegal, share buying of Guinness occurred and remained hidden for months under the existing regulatory set-up. In fact, the Argyll camp complained of unidentified share buying in Guinness during the bid, but Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers said it could find no evidence that the buying was connected to Guinness.    &quot;It is extraordinary that such impropriety and share dealings should have taken place without the regulatory authorities doing anything until they get a tip from Ivan Boesky,&quot; says Robin Cook, a Labor Party spokesman on financial matters. &quot;If it wasn't for that, the whole thing might still be going on.&quot;    ---              CHRONOLOGY OF GUINNESS'S TROUBLES   Dec. 2, 1985: Argyll Group PLC launches $2.85 billion bidfor Distillers Co.
