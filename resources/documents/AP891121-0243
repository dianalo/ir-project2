The October increase in the Labor Department's Consumer PriceIndex, which translated into an annual inflation rate of 5.9percent, followed four months in which the index recorded modestmonthly gains of 0.2 percent or less.   The price spurt was slightly worse than analysts had beenexpecting. The government blamed the rise on a jump in gasolinecosts, higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruitand vegetable prices.   Through the first 10 months of this year, consumer prices haverisen at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, up only slightly from the4.4 percent price gains recorded in both 1987 and 1988.   Many economists are predicting that the best news on inflationhas passed and that coming months will show higher inflationarypressures. Still, few analysts are concerned that the priceincreases will worsen beyond annual rates of around 5 percent.   Underlying inflationary pressures had been masked during thesummer because of big declines in energy prices. With energy pricesnow rebounding somewhat, analysts predicted that inflationarypressures will be intensifying in coming months.   ``Inflation pressures are persisting despite the slowdown in theeconomy,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch.``We had a long string of very moderate inflation reports butinflation was never as good as those numbers indicated.''   Wall Street took the latest inflation report in stride. The DowJones average of 30 industrials rose by almost 6 points in earlytrading.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatershrugged off last month's surge in consumer prices by noting that,if the past six months were averaged, the CPI would show an annualincrease of just 3.3 percent.   ``This is lower than that for any six-month period sinceDecember 1986, and lower than the average inflation of 3.6 percentover the last seven years. So inflation holds relatively steady butat a low level,'' Fitzwater said.   In a second report today, the Labor Department said Americans'average weekly earnings rose to $343.07 in October, 4 percenthigher than a year ago, but not enough to keep up with inflationduring this time period.   Leading the October advance in the Consumer Price Index was a0.9 percent seasonally adjusted jump in gasoline costs, the biggestincrease since a 3.9 percent surge in May. Gasoline prices havebeen on a roller coaster this year, soaring by 21.2 percent in thefirst five months of the year and then falling by 9.3 percent fromJune through September.   The price that consumers actually paid at the pump was unchangedin October. However, gasoline prices normally fall in October, sothe frozen prices translated into an increase after the LaborDepartment made its adjustments to take seasonal factors intoaccount.   Food costs were up 0.4 percent in October, the biggest advancesince a 0.6 percent rise in May.   Fruit and vegetable prices jumped 1.2 percent, reflecting highercosts for apples and bananas. Dairy products posted a huge gain forthe second straight month, rising 1.8 percent for the biggestadvance since May 1980.   New car prices were also up in October, rising by 0.6 percentafter having fallen for five consecutive months. The jump reflectedhigher costs for the 1990 models and a big 1.3 percent rise in autofinancing costs. Used-car prices, however, continued to decline,edging down 0.1 percent after a 0.7 percent drop in September.   Other forms of energy also posted increases in October, withheating-oil prices jumping by 2.5 percent and natural gas andelectricity costs rising by 0.3 percent.   Consumer prices, after discounting food and energy, also rose by0.5 percent. Many analysts consider this to be a better indicationof the underlying inflation rate because it removes the effects oftwo of the most volatile categories.   Clothing costs were up 1 percent in October, reflecting a secondmonth of rising costs with the introduction of new fall and winterclothing lines.   Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the ConsumerPrice Index stood at 125.6 in October, meaning that a hypotheticalselection of goods and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 baseperiod would have cost $125.60 last month, up from $120.20 a yearago.   While October spurt in prices was slightly higher than manyeconomists had been expecting, they said it confrmed their viewthat inflationary pressures are on the rise.   ``Inflation is creeping upwards,'' said Frank McCormick, senioreconomist at Bank of America in San Francisco. ``We see theunderlying rate of inflation going to around 5 percent a year.''   As the year began, the Federal Reserve was fighting inflationarypressures by pushing interest rates higher in an effort to dampeneconomic demand. But since late May, the central bank has beengradually lowering rates in response to fears that thecredit-tightening threatened to push the economy into a recession.   McCormick predicted the central bank would cut interest ratesone more time, probably in December. But he said by May of nextyear, the central bank will begin raising interest rates again andwould continue tightening through the rest of the year.   But Lawrence Chimerine, senior adviser to the WEFA Group, aneconomic consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said he believed theFed was making a mistake by moving so cautiously in cuttinginterest rates.   He predicted inflation would stay in a moderate range withannual increases under 4.5 percent, leaving the Fed with enoughroom to do more to lower interest rates. He said such moves wereneeded to keep the economy from stagnating.   ``I don't see any risk of a major speed-up in inflation,''Chimerine said. ``We are not getting the wage-price spiral thatpeople had expected.''   The Labor Department reported earlier that wholesale prices rose0.4 percent in October, leaving wholesale prices rising at anannual rate of 5.2 percent through the first 10 months of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
