By midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract forAugust delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 27 centsto $15.56 per 42-gallon barrel after closing 47 cents higher onThursday. The contract had traded as high as $16.35 per barrelduring that session.   Among refined products traded on the exchange today, unleadedgasoline was off 0.17 cent a gallon at 52.95 cents after settling2.56 cents higher on Thursday.   Home heating oil, which advanced 1.68 cents a gallon to 44.29cents in the previous session, slipped 0.59 cent to 43.70 cents.   Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Elders Futures Inc., saidtoday's price decline was the result of some profit-taking and ageneral correction from Thursday's overbought condition.   ``It may be a case of calmer heads prevailing today,'' he said.``I think a lot of people felt it was overdone.''   On Thursday, the news of an oil rig explosion off the coast ofScotland ``was the beginning reason for hysteria'' in the oilfutures markets, said John O'Connell, senior energy analyst atRefco Inc.   Prices rose sharply as traders reacted to reports that theexplosion would affect about 12 percent of total North Seaproduction, or as much as 300,000 barrels of oil per day.   ``That sounds very, very impressive, but it's reallyinsignificant _ it's a very small amount of world production,'' andcrude contracts began to ease once traders put the incident intoperspective, O'Connell said.   Gasoline prices rose sharply following a report by the AmericanPetroleum Institute late Wednesday that U.S. inventories ofunleaded gasoline declined by 5 million barrels in the previousweek.   Bob Baker, senior energy analyst at Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc., attributed the decline to higher consumption coupled withrefinery problems that have reduced production.   Analysts also said the market had some left-over nervousnessfrom Wednesday's report that three members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting countries might request an emergency meeting ofthe cartel.   The Kuwaiti news agency quoted unidentified sources as sayingofficials from Venezuela, Algeria and Ecuador wanted OPEC toconsider ways of cutting production and propping up prices.   The report ``continued to be denied, and by late afternoon(Thursday) these hopes had faded and people were becoming morerealistic,'' O'Connell said.   Baker said the request for an OPEC meeting ``doesn't have broadsponsorship at all.   ``They'll only face the same issues they were unable to resolveat the last meeting,'' he said, referring to last month's meetingof the 13-nation cartel in Vienna, Austria, where oil ministersleft the existing system of production quotas and prices intact.   Most OPEC members are thought to be producing above theirindividual quotas or discounting their prices. Some estimates putOPEC production at 3.5 million barrels above the group'sself-imposed overall ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
