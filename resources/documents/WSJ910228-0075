This expense rivalsthat of the Marshall Plan to rebuild postwar Europe, which in1990 dollars totaled about $70 billion, according to RobertD. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.   Whether Kuwait sells investments -- a course its officialsfor the moment rule out -- or borrows against future oilrevenue, the effect on capital markets will be the same.&quot;Money is being taken out of financial assets and being putinto real assets,&quot; says Lacy Hunt, chief economist atHongkongBank. &quot;That lowers the price of financial assets.&quot;   The cost of developing eastern Germany is even greaterthan the estimated price tag for Kuwait. And rebuilding Iraq-- which one day, sooner or later, presumably will have newleadership -- would cost tens of billions of dollars more. Toparaphrase the late Sen. Everett Dirksen, a Marshall Planhere, a Marshall Plan there, and pretty soon you're talkingabout real money.   For the stock prices of U.S. companies that can win bigcontracts, the need to repair Iraqi-scorched Kuwait cannot bebad. But for the credit markets, it raises the bearishspecter of a global competition for capital.   Redevelopment in the Middle East &quot;will draw capital frommarkets. It will reduce the pool of global savings,&quot; Mr.Hormats says. He adds, however, that no one can forecast theprecise effect on rates, which could amount to no more thanan upward nudge.   &quot;Maybe at the margin the cost of capital will get a littlehigher, but this margin is far around the corner,&quot; says WellsFargo's chief economist Joseph Wahed. &quot;I can't even see it.&quot;Many world economies now are sluggish, a situation thatbreeds slack demand for money and thus helps to hold downinterest rates.   If the vast scale of financing Kuwait is mind-numbing, itsimpact may be easier to visualize at a micro level. AsKenneth Lay, a senior manager for financial operations at theWorld Bank, frames the issue, corporate treasurers who delaytheir borrowing run the risk of having to compete for fundsnot only with the deficit-plagued U.S. Treasury but also withthe government of Kuwait. It isn't a pretty thought.   Mr. Lay, however, acknowledges that such fears haven'talways panned out in practice. &quot;People who, due to thedeficit, argued in the '80s that U.S. rates could never fall,or who {more recently} have been waiting for U.S. rates tofirm up, have been disappointed,&quot; he says.   Indeed, the scarce-capital argument has been around awhile and is controversial. In 1990, for the first time inyears, foreigners (excluding governments) sold more U.S.Treasury securities than they purchased -- both fueling andgaining fuel from the falling U.S. dollar. This pattern hasheightened the sense that capital is scarce. &quot;For the thirdand possibly the fourth quarter of 1990, OPEC countries {werenet sellers} of U.S. securities,&quot; says David Strongin, aneconomist with the Securities Industry Association. &quot;There isa competition for limited dollars.&quot;   But Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist of Bear Stearns,dismisses the scarce-capital view as bunk. Quoting from aKudlow report published Monday: &quot;Bond cynics are arguing thatsince war and recession were bullish for lower rates, thenpeace and prosperity will be bearish. But an early finish tothe war will put an end to the constant, manic, worst-casepessimistic scenarios of frustrated bond bears.&quot;   As Mr. Kudlow knows, nothing will put an end to frustratedbond bears. And in fact, as U.S. forces stormed Kuwait,prompting visions of renewed economic growth, U.S. Treasuryissues fell sharply on Tuesday and eased a bit more intrading yesterday.   Bulls such as Mr. Kudlow are fond of saying that Kuwait isdifferent from Germany and Eastern Europe, as it indisputablyis. &quot;They have a fabulous resource to draw on,&quot; Mr. Kudlowsays. &quot;It's called oil. If Kuwait does any selling ofexisting assets, it will be so small we won't even know aboutit.&quot;   However, it may be some time before Kuwait's cash flowfrom oil is anything close to prewar levels. With 500oil-field fires burning, it could be a year before productioneven approaches its former peak of 2.3 million barrels a day,according to Bernard Picchi, a Salomon Brothers oil analyst.&quot;It takes a long time to put out those fires, to drill newwells, to equip them,&quot; Mr. Picchi says. Even when that workis done, he adds, Kuwait will need to rebuild its refiningcapacity.   No one believes money won't be available for rebuildingKuwait -- or, eventually, for Iraq. But whether the war-tornnations finance redevelopment via borrowing or sales ofsecurities shouldn't matter. At the margin, each dollar spentis one less dollar available for lending to the U.S.Treasury, or to corporate borrowers, or for investing inCalifornia real estate or rare stamps.   In 1991, &quot;most of the world's major industrial economies'governments again will tap the financial markets for theirborrowing needs, led by Germany and the U.S.,&quot; says Gert vonder Linde, chief economist of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.At the margin, he argues, demands from Kuwait &quot;mean higherrates.&quot;   Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., agrees, butthinks the effect will be a &quot;dent rather than a blow.&quot; Heargues that the recession in the U.S. and the apparentlydeveloping recessions in European countries -- bullish forbonds -- &quot;will call the tune.&quot;   In fact, it may be risky to assume that any one factorwill overly influence the bond markets. To do so suggeststhat credit markets are static, the Hongkong Bank's Mr. Huntsays. &quot;But the world is not static,&quot; he says. &quot;Other dynamicshocks are constantly occurring.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
