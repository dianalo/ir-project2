The action announced Monday marked the latest escalation in theelectronic war between Cuba and the United States.   Cuba began jamming the Voice of America radio broadcasts duringthe pre-dawn hours last month, then started interfering withprogramming between 6 a.m. and noon.   After the announcement that jamming would be carried out aroundthe clock, the VOA issued a statement saying, ``We deplore thisaction, which is clearly designed to deny the Cuban people accessto uncensored information.''   The jamming of the broadcasts began shortly after the agencystarted testing TV signals to Cuba on March 27. Cuba has jammed theTV tests each day since then.   The Cuban government tolerated the Radio Marti broadcasts forfive years but reacted sharply to the introduction of TV Marti,calling it a violation of national sovereignty, and started jammingthe long-accepted radio signals in addition to blocking the startof TV Marti.</TEXT></DOC>
