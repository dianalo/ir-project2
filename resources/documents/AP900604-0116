Voting 9-0, the justices ruled that the trustee of bankruptAmerican International Airways is not entitled to recover $700,000in taxes paid to the Internal Revenue Service.   The airline had become delinquent by the spring of 1984 inwithholding Social Security and income taxes from employee wages andexcise taxes collected from passengers.   The IRS then ordered the airline to file monthly, instead ofquarterly, tax returns and open a special bank account to handle thetax deposits.   American International filed for bankruptcy in July 1984 to tryto reorganize the business and pay off some of the money owedcreditors. That effort failed and three months later a trustee wasappointed to liquidate the company.   The trustee sought to recover $1.6 million in taxes paid to theIRS in the months leading up to the liquidation.   A bankruptcy judge in Pennsylvania permitted the trustee torecover $700,000 from the government and the IRS appealed to the 3rdU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Philadelphia.   The appeals court said the trustee may not recover the $700,000.The balance collected by the IRS was not at issue in that ruling ortoday's decision.   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the high court, said the$700,000 was not the property of American International, but ratherwas being held in trust for the IRS.   The case is Begier vs. IRS, 899-393.</TEXT></DOC>
