Severaladvanced proving systems resulting from efforts addressing this industrydesire are presented in this paper. These systems are directed towardthe needs and peculiarities of proving both low flow (domestic) and highflow (transmission and distribution) metering equipment. Specific itemsdiscussed are: the laboratory piston prover, designed to determine volumeto within 0.01% or better; updated production calibration equipment,which adapt improved control technologies developed on the piston proverto the older bell prover; a transfer standard for dual rotary meters;replacement of original transfer standard turbine meters with 'smart'turbine meters that continually check their calibration while in service;and an auto-adjust prover for field use. Test facilities at which thesedevelopments occurred are also described. 30 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
