Should it spend $40,000 to control squirrel and rodent damage in Vermont? Or $100,000 for a guard-dog program in Oregon?    President Reagan thinks not. In his State of the Union address last night, he announced an unusual plan to attack such time-honored &quot;pork barrel&quot; projects. Within the next 30 days, he plans to submit to Congress a proposal to &quot;rescind&quot; as much as $4.3 billion of &quot;pork&quot; placed in the congressional spending bill late last year.    Under the budget law, the president can propose rescissions of money approved by Congress and delay disbursing the funds for 45 days. If Congress fails to act on the president's proposals, however, the money will be spent as planned.    &quot;By acting and approving this plan,&quot; the president said in a challenge to Congress, &quot;you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that is out of control.&quot;    However, members of Congress who serve on the Appropriations Committees have long considered such projects part of the perquisites of power and will be reluctant to forgo them.    &quot;This is as old as Congress,&quot; said Richard Fenno, a political scientist. &quot;One person's pork is another person's lifeline.&quot;    A list compiled by the White House budget office and provided to The Wall Street Journal shows 80 pages of projects totaling $4.3 billion, all of which the administration considers pork. The projects range from $240,000 for a program &quot;to control rat damage to sugar cane and macadamia nuts&quot; to $100,000 for &quot;taste-aversion research&quot; in Arizona, Texas, California and Nevada.    Potatoes get special attention. According to the budget-office list, the bill included $500,000 for attacking potato ring rot disease, $350,000 for early dying disease, another $350,000 for marketing research by the National Potato Council, and new funding for a potato-research laboratory in East Grand Fork, Minn.    Also showered with benefits is the state of Mississippi, home of Democratic Rep. Jamie Whitten, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. The bill contained $9.5 million for four highway-safety projects in the state, $225,000 for cormorant research, $100,000 to study the feasibility of raising redfish in ponds, $50,000 for a study of whether to establish a &quot;School Food Service Management Institute&quot; in Mississippi, and $5,000 for erosion control in the Yazoo Basin.    The rescission plans will come as bad news to numerous favored universities around the country. Included on the pork list is $53.2 million for constructing research facilities at schools in more than a dozen congressional districts.    And the president's proposal could shrink the size of St. Louis.    A provision tucked into the money bill requires the government to include the city of Sullivan, Mo., as part of the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area -- a change boosting the Medicare payment rate for one local hospital by $1 million.    Rescissions aren't a new strategy for the Reagan administration. In 1981, the president proposed rescinding $15.3 billion of budget authority approved during the Carter presidency; Congress agreed to cut $14.7 billion. But for the most part, those cuts came from basic government programs. This time, the president will be attacking projects closer to the hearts and homes of members of Congress. </TEXT></DOC>
