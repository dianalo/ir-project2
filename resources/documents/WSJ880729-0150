In papers to be unsealed in state court today, detectives charge that Lawrence L. Krasnick of Coral Springs, Fla., engineered the scheme by selling manufacturers' coupons to retail stores and to storefronts set up for the purpose.    He is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, organized fraud and numerous counts of grand theft. Malcolm Purow, an attorney for Mr. Krasnick, said his client will plead innocent to the charges.    James Layman, an organized-crime investigator at the Broward County sheriff's office, said Mr. Krasnick and others obtained the coupons from newspaper recycling centers and through bulk purchases at $6 to $8 a pound from suppliers such as Lois Kerr, wife of a retired Coral Gables, Fla., police captain. She in turn bought them from charities such as the American Cancer Society and American Heart Association, police said.    Mrs. Kerr is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, organized fraud, grand theft and communications fraud. Her attorney, Michael J. Osman, said his client is &quot;completely innocent.&quot;    &quot;She solicited coupons from charities and paid them money to cut them for her,&quot; he said. &quot;She had nothing to do with the redemption of them. She sold them to people who we know now were involved in a monumental fraud.&quot;    Detective Layman said that although the case is a significant one, it merely scratches the surface of coupon fraud, which one industry group estimates may be costing $500 million a year in losses to manufacturers.    &quot;It's a tremendous problem nationally,&quot; said Henry Goodson, manager of the corporate security division of Procter andamp; Gamble, the Cincinnati-based consumer-products concern that relies heavily on coupons in its marketing. &quot;Coupons are extremely important to introduce new products and to test brand loyalty.&quot;    He said companies such as Procter andamp; Gamble provide &quot;administrative and financial assistance&quot; to drives against coupon fraud &quot;because law enforcement is limited in what it can spend.&quot;    Several other large consumer product companies were listed by police as victims of the scheme, including Warner-Lambert Co., Gillette Co., Kellogg Co., Bristol-Myers Co. and Johnson andamp; Johnson. </TEXT></DOC>
