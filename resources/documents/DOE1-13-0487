This machine directlyexecutes Formal Functional Programming (FFP) code. A method to embedSQL statements in FFP programs is described. Schemes for parallel implementationof simple retrieval statements are presented for different I/O architectures.Then techniques for parallel implementation of more complex retrievalstatements are given. Because the FFP machine can accommodate the almostunbounded parallelism of FFP programs, execution time analysis showspotential for highly efficient execution of relational database querieson this machine. Modifications of the FFP machine to speed up input/outputoperations are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
