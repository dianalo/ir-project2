Meanwhile, as part of a public relations strategy to getmaximum attention for the popular elements of its budget, theWhite House said next week's $7 billion budget proposal forthe Environmental Protection Agency will include high-profilespending for sewage-treatment grants to big cities, new stateparks and cleanup projects along the Gulf of Mexico.</LP><TEXT>   Until recently, Bush administration officials had beensaying they expected the president to repeat last year'scapital gains proposal: cutting the top rate to 19.6% forassets held for three years. Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady, among others, argued this would encourage investors totake a longer-run view. But some conservatives have lobbiedaggressively for dropping the top rate to 15% for assets heldfor one year and eliminating the tax altogether forlow-income and moderate-income taxpayers. The topcapital-gains tax rate is now 28%.   Conservative leaders on Capitol Hill appear confident thatthe president will move in their direction, although theyweren't certain of details. After conversations with Mr.Bush, Chief of Staff Samuel Skinner and campaign chairmanRobert Teeter, House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia&quot;expects to see a better capital gains package than thepresident proposed last year,&quot; a spokesman for Mr. Gingrichsaid.   &quot;The president's inclined to move it {the capital-gainsproposal} a little closer to what the conservatives areproposing,&quot; said Charles Black, a senior adviser to there-election campaign.   And an administration official said it now &quot;looks like&quot;Mr. Bush will propose a lower capital gains rate than lastyear. He said Mr. Bush had been influenced by reminders thathe had campaigned on a 15% capital-gains rate in 1988, and byRep. Gingrich's invocation of the president's can-do attitudeduring the Persian Gulf War. &quot;That argument hit him on hisleadership funny bone,&quot; the official said.   In a similar vein, this official said, Mr. Bush appearslikely to propose increasing the personal tax exemption by$1,000 a child, somewhat larger than officials havepreviously indicated. The exemption is currently $2,300 aperson.   Treasury and congressional estimators agree that a cut inthe capital-gains tax rate brings in extra revenue in thefirst couple of years, because it encourages investors tosell assets. A deeper cut in the capital-gains tax rate,particularly one that didn't require a three-year holdingperiod, might bring in more revenue than the original Bushplan. That could make more room for money-losing tax cutsunder the rules of the 1990 budget law.   No matter what the particulars, the fate of Mr. Bush'scapital-gains proposal depends on his ability to fashion acompromise with the Democrats who control Congress.Democratic leaders insist that they will go along only if Mr.Bush accepts an increase in the top personal income tax rate,something the president has vowed to fight.   Mr. Bush will unveil his economic package in his State ofthe Union speech on Tuesday and his budget on Wednesday, andsenior officials said the budget document itself already isset in type. But the administration delayed decisions ondefense spending cuts so long that details won't be printeduntil later in February.   Although decisions on the speech aren't final, a seniorofficial predicted that Mr. Bush will set a deadline --perhaps as early as March 15 -- for congressional action onhis program. But some aides note that the 100-day deadlinethe president set last year for crime and transportationlegislation had little effect.   Mr. Bush said yesterday he will talk about health carenext Tuesday, but details aren't expected until a Feb. 6speech, officials said. One issue in dispute is whether torequire all employers to make insurance available to theirworkers -- at the workers' expense -- or whether to simplyrequire employers to tell their employees how to getinsurance. A rival Democratic plan would force employers topay for coverage.   Another thorny issue is whether to advance a proposal totax the richest Americans -- those with incomes above$100,000 or $125,000 -- for employer-provided healthinsurance that is worth more than about $4,500 a family. Somecampaign advisers are worried about the political costs ofsuch a proposal.   The White House also is expected to propose tax credits orvouchers, worth perhaps as much as $3,750 a family, to helplow-income people buy health insurance and a new taxdeduction to help families with incomes below $60,000 or$70,000 defray health insurance costs their employers don'tpay.   As part of the budget for fiscal 1993, which begins Oct.1, the White House said yesterday it will propose a 6%increase in the EPA's budget authority from the current $6.6billion. Budget authority is the amount an agency ispermitted to spend, though actual spending in a given year isset by separate legislation.   On sewage-treatment grants, for example, much of thespending probably won't occur for 10 or 15 years. That makesit especially attractive to budget officials: They can claimcredit now, but the spending won't swell the deficit foryears.   In the budget, proposed spending authority for waste-watertreatment grants would increase by $100 million, to $2.5billion. The White House said it will seek specific grantsfor Boston, New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, Baltimore andSeattle.   The EPA's operating budget would rise $120 million, to$2.7 billion. Budget authority for hazardous-waste cleanupunder the Superfund program would rise $134 million, to $1.75billion.   The Interior Department's budget would include a bigrise-to $60 million from $23 million this year-in a programto create state parks and recreation facilities. The budgetalso would set up a program under which park visitors couldpay $30 for a &quot;passport&quot; that would get them into anynational park all year long. Proceeds would go directly topark upkeep.   As always, a good deal of the federal environmental budgetwould go to cleaning up Energy Department nuclear-weaponsproduction plants. The president said he is seeking $5.5billion -- up $1.1 billion from the current year -- to bringvarious facilities in compliance with environmental laws.   In other budget developments:   -- The Housing and Urban Development Department budget isexpected to propose diverting less than $10 million from theexisting Community Development Block Grant program to a newfund to give states incentives to remove regulatory barriersto low-income and moderate-income housing, such as excessivezoning and building permit requirements.   -- The administration plans a new push to modernize thebanking system, though officials concede there is littlechance for election-year passage of measures that died inCongress last year.   The new budget will warn that unless Congress allows banksto operate more efficiently, rising bank failures mayultimately require a taxpayer bailout of the bank depositinsurance fund.   -- More than 50 House Republicans met yesterday with Mr.Skinner and White House Budget Director Richard Darman, andone of them demanded Mr. Darman's ouster. Texas Rep. RichardArmey, a persistent critic of the budget director, said, &quot;Hehas served the president poorly, he has served the nationpoorly, with his bad judgment and advice over everything he'sworked on,&quot; according to those present. Mr. Armey confirmedthe reports. Mr. Darman didn't respond, and several otherRepublicans later apologized for their colleague's remarks.   ---   John Harwood contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
