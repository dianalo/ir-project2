Many traders still expect the dollar's decline to resume. But some of them see positive factors influencing short-term trading; and the few who are bullish on the dollar say they sense a steadily improving outlook.    For most of this year, a negative view on the dollar has prevailed, based on the U.S.'s chronically wide trade and budget deficits. Traders also took a cue from U.S. political pressure for a lower dollar, although Washington policy makers have abandoned that campaign lately.    The dollar now has dropped 47% in value against other major currencies since early 1985. In the past four weeks, the dollar fell 5% to a three-month low in anticipation of Friday's release of July U.S. trade data.    But this buildup of market bias against the dollar may have set the stage for the currency's rebound Friday.    As the Commerce Department announced that the U.S. trade deficit widened to $16.47 billion in July from $15.71 billion in June, a large number of market players were holding short, or oversold, dollar positions in the expectation that they could buy back dollars at a lower price after the announcement.    Accordingly, the dollar's drop was brief as these bears turned into buyers to cover their short positions, pushing the currency higher.    &quot;The trend is still down in the long run. But in the short run, they're still trying to buy back dollars,&quot; Yuichi Sugiura, foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank Ltd.'s New York branch, said.    Mr. Sugiura said Japanese institutional investors became buyers as the dollar held above its lows for the week. According to another market source, Japanese institutions purchased about $2 billion Friday with which to make other U.S. investments.    The dollar also got a boost from signs that real, or inflation-adjusted, U.S. interest rates remain high, an attraction to foreign capital. In addition, the U.S. producer price index was unchanged for August, dispelling some inflation concerns.    &quot;When you compare the inflation with the most recent jump in (U.S. bond) yields, the real rates of return look very outstanding,&quot; Arthur C. Agostini, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said.    To the handful of dollar optimists, though, the horizon seemed to be aglow even before last week. Eishi Wakabayashi, executive vice president and head of trading at Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International Inc., New York, has been telling customers of his Tokyo-based investment concern about a coming dollar rebound for months.    He contends that in volume terms, the U.S. trade gap is actually narrowing at an annual rate of $30 billion and that higher import prices are mostly responsible for the apparently mounting deficit. &quot;Sooner or later, this will be heading back down,&quot; he says.    Another significant factor favoring the dollar, he says, is that the Reagan administration is no longer encouraging a decline in the currency to try to improve U.S. trade competitiveness. The U.S. abandoned that strategy this year as a slumping dollar threatened foreign investment.    &quot;A lower dollar is really harmful for the U.S. these days, and the administration knows that,&quot; Mr. Wakabayashi says.    Additional bullish factors include the slowdown in U.S. money supply growth, in contrast to faster growth abroad, and progress in reducing the federal budget deficit, he says.    &quot;I think everything fundamental is improving in the U.S., although it's still under water,&quot; he says. The dollar could appreciate as much as 25% against the Japanese yen by the end of next year, he says.    But converts to the bullish view are slow in coming.    &quot;I don't buy it completely,&quot; Garrett R. Glass, vice president, foreign exchange, at First National Bank of Chicago, says. Mr. Glass says he does see a 60% to 70% chance for a major dollar recovery in the next six months. But, he says, &quot;I won't start buying aggressively until I'm 90% sure.&quot;    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The trade deficit news took a nervous market on a roller-coaster ride that left the dollar substantially higher against the Japanese yen and up by a lesser amount against other major currencies.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 143.91 yen, a 1.1% rise from 142.41 yen late Thursday. The U.S. currency rose 0.2% to 1.8075 West German marks from 1.8046.    The dollar initially dipped on the news that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit had widened. An unexpected rush of buying by Japanese institutions then combined with purchases by traders covering short, or oversold, positions to push the currency to its highest level against the yen in three weeks.    The dollar's strength against the yen partly resulted from the narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan while the gap widened in U.S. trade with Western Europe and Canada, Yuichi Sugiura, foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank's New York branch, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $6.30 an ounce to $456.80 in heavy trading. Estimated volume was 5.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $457.55 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                      Late New York Trading                     Friday, Sept. 11, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
