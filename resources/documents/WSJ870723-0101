The commission was careful to note that it wasn't questioning whether Texaco improperly interfered with the Pennzoil-Getty agreement, as a state-court jury in Houston found in 1985. Nor, the commission said, was it questioning whether Pennzoil really had the merger agreement it claimed.    Nevertheless, the agency said, if Pennzoil had a contract with Getty Oil, &quot;this arrangement plainly violated&quot; federal securities laws.    Pennzoil didn't immediately comment on the SEC's statements, which were contained in a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Texas Supreme Court. The brief urges the court to accept Texaco's appeal of Pennzoil's mammoth court judgment on the ground that the securities-law question at stake &quot;is a matter whose significance extends well beyond this case.&quot;    Pennzoil previously, however, had dismissed out of hand the idea that the securities-law matter has the slightest relevance to its dispute with Texaco, which began when Texaco acquired all of Getty Oil in early 1984, breaking up Pennzoil's plan to acquire 42% of Getty.    Texaco expressed its pleasure over the brief, but restrained the temptation to gloat. Others close to Texaco -- but not directly involved with it -- were less restrained in their reaction.    &quot;This has to improve Texaco's chances dramatically,&quot; said Michael Schwartz, a partner in the New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, whose client, the J. Paul Getty Museum, was involved in the securities-law issue cited by the SEC. &quot;For an agency of the federal government, with no interest in the case, to say the contract was illegal is very significant. No law,&quot; Mr. Schwartz asserted, &quot;allows you to benefit from a contract that's illegal.&quot;    Steven Fierson of the Philadelphia law firm of Dechert, Price andamp; Rhoads, which represented Getty Oil, was surprised at the scope of the SEC's brief. &quot;It seems to me the SEC has gone much further than one would have expected it to go -- much further on Texaco's side.&quot;    Pennzoil shares closed yesterday at $76.625, down $1.875, and Texaco ended at $46 a share, up 25 cents, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The agency was sensitive to the chance that its brief would boost Texaco's public-relations standing -- if not a legal position -- in the case. &quot;We were aware there would be perceptions, speculation and even market reaction as to how much we were helping one side or the other,&quot; said Daniel Goelzer, the agency's general counsel. The brief's sole intent, however, was to &quot;foster the correct interpretation of securities laws.&quot; A Texas Court of Appeals opinion upholding Pennzoil's judgment, the brief said, was based on an &quot;erroneous premise,&quot; on &quot;wholly irrelevant&quot; speculation and on &quot;compound hypotheticals.&quot;    The issue is SEC Rule 10b-13, which prohibits anyone from buying stock -- or even arranging to do so -- while that person has a tender offer outstanding. The law is intended to prevent unequal treatment of shareholders -- and, as applied, blocks major shareholders, usually insiders, from getting a better deal than rank-and-file investors.    In January 1984, while it had a $100-a-share tender offer outstanding for 20% of Getty Oil's shares, Pennzoil arranged to buy the entire 12% of Getty Oil that was held by the Getty Museum of Malibu, Calif., for about $112.50 a share. At the time, Harold Williams, a former SEC chairman who had become president of the museum, asserted that the museum wished for no better treatment than other shareholders. Nevertheless, Pennzoil's payment terms for the museum's shares plainly &quot;favored the museum,&quot; the SEC wrote. Pennzoil later did offer other holders the same price, although they wouldn't have been paid as quickly as the museum.    The SEC's brief far from assures a reversal of Pennzoil's judgment. The appeals courts could find that other evidence in the case, such as the &quot;intent to be bound&quot; that the jury found between Pennzoil and Getty Oil, outweighed any technical defects in Pennzoil's purported contract.    But while the SEC didn't address whether Pennzoil actually had a contract for Texaco to interfere with, it did, in a footnote, cite a section of the Securities Exchange Act stating that &quot;every contract made in violation of any provision&quot; of the act &quot;shall be void . . . .&quot;    Texaco has called attention to the remarks of a Pennzoil lawyer during the trial in Houston, who said that if the rule were an impediment to Pennzoil's contract, &quot;then the contract was void and we have no case.&quot; But Pennzoil has asserted that its expert counsel on the subject -- Louis Loss of Harvard University Law School, a former SEC staff member -- had determined that the rule had no relevance in the case.    Besides arguing otherwise, the SEC brief also attacked the finding by the lower appeals court that Pennzoil could easily have obtained a routine exemption of Rule 10b-13. Pennzoil, the brief said, &quot;could not retroactively seek to 'cure' the violation it had already committed,&quot; nor would an exemption likely have been granted in any case. Pennzoil has also asserted it could only have violated the rule by acting with fraudulent intent, a claim that the SEC rejected as &quot;wholly without basis.&quot;    The brief didn't address Pennzoil's contention that if it had violated Rule 10b-13, then so had Texaco, when it privately arranged to pay $128 a share to members of the Getty family while offering to pay the public only $125; Texaco eventually paid all holders the higher amount. </TEXT></DOC>
