And the institution that he heads, Bank of Boston Corp., is in many ways a stronghold of Yankee conservative values.    But Mr. Stepanian, who became chief executive last March, showed on Monday that he isn't afraid to act radically. His decision to write off loans to less-developed countries and increase loss reserves placed Bank of Boston well ahead of other U.S. banks that are struggling to cope with the Third World debt problem.    The move surprised analysts and money managers familiar with the bank. &quot;Rarely, in my recollection, have they been this much out front&quot; on a major issue, said Anthony Cope, senior vice president at Wellington Management Co., a money-management firm here.    The decision unmistakably puts the imprint of Mr. Stepanian -- hardly the typical head of a Brahmin institution -- on Bank of Boston. By dealing with all potential losses from its overseas loan portfolio during his first year as chief executive, Mr. Stepanian has positioned the bank to perform better during the remainder of his tenure.    Mr. Stepanian grew up in the working-class Boston suburb of Somerville. His father, an Armenian immigrant, ran a cigar stand. Mr. Stepanian earned an economics degree from Tufts University and, after two unsuccessful tries, finally landed a job with the bank four years later.    Ethnic background wasn't an obstacle to his climb through the ranks, Mr. Stepanian says. But, he adds, &quot;I don't think I've ever forgotten where I came from.&quot;    Mr. Stepanian is low-key, almost professorial in appearance and manner. His hair tends to be mildly unruly, his tie slightly askew. He measures his words carefully.    As president, he helped William Brown, chairman and then-chief executive, deal with one of the bank's more difficult periods in 1985, when it gained prominence as the first of several major banks to be fined for failing to report cash transactions with foreign banks. Federal officials trying to stop money-laundering made an example of the bank.    The publicity and the bank's combative and unapologetic handling of the problem tarnished its reputation.    Since he became chief executive earlier this year, there have been hints that Mr. Stepanian intends to move more aggressively to promote the bank's image. In August, he hired Ira Jackson as director of external affairs; as state-revenue commissioner for Massachusetts, Mr. Jackson had designed a widely hailed tax amnesty program.    In a sense, Monday's announcement was consistent with Bank of Boston's recent strategy of accentuating its role as a New England bank with nationwide businesses -- a leader among the new breed of &quot;superregionals&quot; -- rather than one that long ago took on an international lending role unusual for a bank its size.    Mr. Stepanian characterized the decision to write off or place on non-accrual status nearly all the bank's Third World loans as &quot;bold but prudent steps, consistent with our conservative approach to asset quality.&quot; He was careful to note that Bank of Boston's Third World loans are modest compared with those of the major money-center banks.    The bank will write off $200 million of its Third World loans, and it has added $200 million to its loan-loss reserves. It also placed on non-accrual status $470 million in loans to less-developed countries that are unrelated to trade. As a result, Bank of Boston has reserved or charged off 63% of its $1 billion Third World loan exposure, compared with 25% to 30% for most major U.S. banks.    Senior bank executives -- including Mr. Brown; Alan McKinnon, chief financial officer; and Charles Gifford and Clark Miller, executive vice presidents -- began seriously reassessing the bank's exposure to less-developed countries about two months ago, Mr. Stepanian says. While Bank of Boston had joined other banks earlier in the year in boosting its loan-loss reserves, the executives grew concerned that further steps might be necessary.    The bank examined other ways of dealing with the problem, including debt-to-equity swaps and sales of debt. For example, after long negotiations, the bank yesterday bought a 40% interest in a Philippine bank through a debt-to-equity swap. But the potential for dealing with the problem through such means was too limited, the executives concluded.    In the end, says Mr. Stepanian, Bank of Boston decided to treat the loans to foreign nations much as it would loans to shaky companies. While it still plans to serve the &quot;trade-related and other overseas banking needs&quot; of its domestic customers, he says, the bank will be looking mainly to its home base for future growth.    With barriers to interstate banking coming down, and with changes likely in the federal law separating the banking and securities industries, the bank will have to adjust to a changing domestic environment, Mr. Stepanian says. &quot;How best to position ourselves will be the challenge,&quot; he adds. </TEXT></DOC>
