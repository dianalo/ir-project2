The affected public has notbeen sufficiently identified at this stage of the FmHA review. Should anapplication be approved, each project to be assessed would undergo theapplicable environmental review and public notification requirements inSubpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter prior to FmHA's consent to use loanfunds for an ultimate recipient. FmHA will prepare an Environmental ImpactStatement for any application for a loan determined to have a significanteffect on the quality of the human environment.

L. 99-198, section 1323 of the FoodSecurity Act of 1985, there were provisions that affected the interestrates on those loans. (1) Those loans made in 1980 and 1981 carried an original note rate of1 percent interest when they were first issued. The legislation providesfor those loans made in 1980 and 1981 to have a permanent interest ratereduction to 1 percent effective December 23, 1985, to maturity. However,the interest rates on the loans made in 1983 and 1984 may remain the sameas the original note rate. (2) Loans made in 1983 and 1984 do not automatically qualify for a lowerrate than the level of interest rates when the notes were first issued.Section 407 of Pub. L. 99-425 provides for a weighted average requirementthat would affect those loans made in 1983 and 1984 to intermediary borrowers.(3) In those cases where loans were made to RDLF intermediaries and theweighted average of all loans made by the RDLF intermediary after December31, 1982, does not exceed the sum of 6 percent plus the interest rate tothe intermediary (7 percent), the interest rate to be charged the RDLFintermediary will be the rate charged on such loans made in 1980, or 1percent. Should the weighted average exceed 7 percent, the note rate willcontrol. (i) In order for FmHA to determine the weighted average of the loan portfolio,the RDLF intermediary will be required to complete a weighted loan averagerate on its outstanding portfolio. The schedule prepared for FmHA's reviewshould include: (A) Calculations of the interest amount scheduled to accrue on each loanoutstanding over a 1-year period based on the current interest rate ofeach ultimate recipient's loan. (B) The sum total of interest on each individual loan will be added togetherto determine the total interest amount scheduled to accrue over a 1-yearperiod. (C) Divide the total of paragraph (a)(2) of this section by the total principaloutstanding to determine the average interest percent yield in the intermediary'sloan portfolio. (D) The loans to be included in determining the weighted interest averagewill be those made from January 1, 1983, forward. (E) FmHA will use the anniversary date for October 1 of each year to requestthe intermediary to complete a weighted interest average to determine theinterest rate on its RDLF loan for the coming calendar year, January 1thourgh December 31. All loans made in 1980 and 1981 have had the interestrate permanently reduced by legislation to 1 percent, effective December25, 1985. (F) The weighted loan average interest rate on the outstanding loan portfolioas referenced in this section will be forwarded to FmHA along with sufficientdocumentation which should include calculations, list of outstanding loans,current interest rate being charged on the loan, etc. (b) Interest rates charged by intermediaries to the ultimate recipientsshall be at rates negotiated by those parties. Intermediaries are encouragedto make loans to ultimate recipients at the lowest possible rate, takinginto account the cost of the loan funds to the intermediary and the costof administering the loan portfolio. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection;1951.861 through 1951.865 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1951.8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Security.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Loans from RDLF intermediaries to ultimate recipients.</T3> Securityrequirements for loans from intermediaries to ultimate recipients willbe negotiated between the intermediaries and ultimate recipients.

The initial approval of aloan will be the subject of intergovernmental consulation. For each ultimaterecipient to be assisted with a loan under this Subpart and for which theState in which the ultimate recipient to be located has elected to reviewthe program under their intergovernmental review process, the State Pointof Contact must be notified. Notification, in the form of a project description,can be initiated by the intermediary or the ultimate recipient. Any commentsfrom the State must be included with the intermediary's request to usethe loan funds for the ultimate recipient. Prior to FmHA's decision onthe request, compliance with the requirements of intergovernmental consultationmust be demonstrated for each ultimate recipient. These requirements shouldbe carried out in accordance with FmHA Instruction 1940-J, ``IntergovernmentalReview of Farmers Home Administration Programs and Activities,'' availablein any FmHA office. (b) <T3>Environmental requirements. </T3>(1) Unless specifically modified bythis section, the requirements of Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapterapply to this subpart. FmHA will give particular emphasis to ensuring compliancewith the environmental policies contained in andSection;andSection; 1940.303and 1940.304 in Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter. Intermediariesand ultimate recipients of loans must consider the potential environmentalimpacts of their projects at the earliest planning stages and develop plansto minimize the potential to adversely impact the environment.(2) When an ultimate recipient is to receive Federal funds, the intermediarymust provide a completed Form FmHA 1940-20, ``Request for EnvironmentalInformation,'' for each Class I or Class II project specifically identifiedin its plan. FmHA will review the materials and required Forms FmHA 1940-20and initiate a Class II environmental assessment. This assessment willfocus on the potential cumulative impacts of the projects as well as anyenvironmental concerns or problems that are associated with individualprojects and that can be identified at this time from the information submitted.Because neither the completion of the environmental assessment nor theapproval of the application is an FmHA commitment to the use of loan fundsfor a specific project, no public notification requirements for a ClassII assessment will apply. The affected public has not been sufficientlyidentified at this stage of the FmHA review. Each project to be assessedwill undergo the applicable environmental review and public notificationrequirements in Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter prior to FmHA'sconsent to use Federal funds. FmHA will prepare an Environmental ImpactStatement for any ultimate recipient determined to have a significant effecton the quality of the human environment. Both the intermediary and theultimate recipient will cooperate and furnish such information and assistanceas FmHA needs to make any of its environmental determinations.(3) As part of the intermediary's request to FmHA for concurrence to makea loan to an ultimate recipient, the intermediary will include for theultimate recipient a properly completed Form FmHA 1940-20, if it is classifiedas a Class I or Class II action. FmHA will complete the environmental reviewrequired by Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter. The results of thisreview will be used by FmHA in making its decision on the request.(c) <T3>Equal opportunity and nondiscrimination requirements. </T3>(1) In accordancewith Title V of Pub.

A schedule of life insurance available for the benefit of theloan will be included as part of the application.(iii) Workmen's compensation insurance on ultimate recipients is requiredin accordance with State law.(iv) The RDLF intermediary is responsible for determining if an ultimaterecipient is located in a special flood or mudslide hazard area anytimeFederal funds are involved. If the ultimate recipient is in a flood ormudslide area, then flood or mudslide insurance must be provided.(b) The RDLF intermediary will agree:(1) Not to make any changes in the RDLF intermediary's articles of incorporationor charter without the concurrence of FmHA.(2) Not to make a loan commitment to an ultimate recipient without firstreceiving FmHA's concurrence in the proposed use of Federal funds.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection; 1951.878 through 1951.880 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.881 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Loan servicing.</ITAG>(a) These regulations do not negate contractual arrangements that werepreviously made by the HHS, Office of Community Services (OCS), or theintermediaries operating relending programs that have already been enteredinto with ultimate recipients under previous regulations.

No one classification shouldbe viewed as more important than others. The uncollectibility aspect ofDoubtful and Loss classifications is of obvious importance. However, thefunction of the Substandard classification is to indicate those loans thatare unduly risky which may result in future losses. Substandard, Doubtfuland Loss are adverse classifications. The special mention classificationis for loans which are not adversely classified but which require the attentionand followup of FmHA. The loans will be classfied as follows:(1) <T3>Seasoned Loan Classification. </T3>To be classified as a seasoned loan,a loan must:(1) Have a remaining principal loan balance of two thirds or less of theoriginal aggregate of all existing loans made to that intermediary.(2) Be in compliance with all loan conditions and FmHA regulations.(3) Have been current on the loan(s) payments for 24 consective months.(4) Be secured by collateral which is determined to be adequate to ensurethere will be no loss on the loan.(b) <T3>Current Non-problem Classification. </T3>This classification includesthose loans which have been current for less than 24 consecutive monthsand are in compliance with the loan conditions and FmHA regulations, andare not considered to pose a credit risk to FmHA. These loans would beclassified as seasoned but for the ``24 months'' and ``two-thirds'' requirementsfor seasoned loans.(c) <T3>Special Mention Classification. </T3>This classification includes loanswhich do not presently expose FmHA to a sufficient degree of risk to warranta Substandard classification but do possess credit deficiencies deservingFmHA's close attention because the failure to correct these deficienciescould result in greater credit risk in the future. This classificationwould include loans that may be high quality, but which FmHA is unableto supervise properly because of an inadequate loan agreement, the conditionor lack of control over the colleteral, failure to obtain proper documentationor any other deviations from prudent lending practices. Adverse trendsin the intermediary's operation or an imbalanced position in the balancesheet which has not reached a point that jeopardizes the repayment of theloan should be assigned to this classification. Loans in which actual,not potential, weaknesses are evident and significant should be consideredfor a Substandard classification.(d) <T3>Substandard Classifications</T3>. This classification includes loanswhich are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and payingcapacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans inthis classification must have a well defined weakness or weaknesses thatjeopardize the payment in full of the debt. If the deficiencies are notcorrected, there is a distinct possibility that FmHA will sustain someloss.(e) <T3>Doubtful Classification</T3>. This classification includes those loanswhich have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandardwith the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidationin full, based on currently known facts, conditions and values, highlyquestionable and improbable.(f) <T3>Loss Classifications</T3>. This classification includes those loanswhich are considered uncollectible and of such little value that theircontinuance as loans is not warranted. Even though partial recovery maybe effected in the future, it is not practical or desirable to defer writingoff these basically worthless loans.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection; 1951.886 through 1951.888</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.889</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Transfer and assumption.</ITAG>(a) All transfers and assumptions must be approved in advance in writingby FmHA.
