Traders say end-of-quarter buying helped lift share pricesagain yesterday. Money managers typically add winning stocksto their portfolios near the end of each period to dress uptheir stock lists for when they are reviewed by sponsors.Others buy freely near the end of the quarter in hopes ofboosting the prices of stocks that they already own.   Firming bond prices helped set the stage for yesterday'sstock gains. Treasury issues added as much as 1/4 point,shrugging off some economic news that hints at a strongereconomy. Yesterday morning, the Labor Department reportedthat initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped by17,000 during the week ended June 17.   Bonds dipped on the news, but recovered before the stockmarket opened.   Nearly 7 points of yesterday's gains by the Dow Jonesindustrials came from Allied-Signal, which surged 3 7/8 to 331/4. Investors celebrated the news that Lawrence A. Bossidywill take over as the company's chairman and chief executiveofficer, succeeding Edward L. Hennessy, who will soon retire.   Alan Shaw, senior vice president in charge of technicalresearch at Smith Barney Harris Upham, says Allied-Signal'sstock was attractive before the management change wasannounced.   Among the broader indexes, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-StockIndex rose 2.81 to 374.40, the New York Stock ExchangeComposite Index climbed 1.40 to 204.94, and the Dow JonesEquity Market Index rallied 2.48 to 348.92.   Advancing stocks led decliners on the New York StockExchange, 949 to 591. Big Board volume totaled 155,820,000shares, down from the 186,830,000 shares which changed handsWednesday.   Mr. Shaw says the market could rally back to the top ofits trading range, with the industrials average climbing toits recent peak of 3035.33.   Dale Tills, manager of institutional trading at CharlesSchwab andamp; Co., says that stocks are sure to rally if long-termbond market yields fall back below 8.5%. Some of thelong-term Treasuries still yield slightly more.   Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at KemperSecurities, says that internal features of the market areshowing signs of strain. There is no clear leadership by anyof the market's sectors, the breadth of advancing stocks overdeclining stocks has been poor, and trading volume has beenlow, he says.   &quot;The market will have trouble making meaningful headway inthe immediate future,&quot; Mr. Chalasani predicts.   But Smith Barney's Mr. Shaw says the market can survivesuch internal deterioration for weeks before the majoraverages crumble.   &quot;The playing field should be relatively safe through thesummer,&quot; he says. By the time the market's internal weaknessbecomes critical, the economic recovery may save the marketfrom any serious slide, he adds.
