L. No. 100-86), relating to so-called nonbank banks. CEBA amendedthe definition of ``bank'' in the Bank Holding Company Act (``BHC Act'')to include certain banking institutions that had previously been outsidethat definition (so-called ``nonbank banks''). CEBA also contained a grandfatherprovision that permitted nonbanking companies that controlled nonbank banksas of March 5, 1987, to retain control of the institution and not be treatedas a bank holding company for purposes of the BHC Act if the company andits subsidiary nonbank bank observe certain restrictions. These limitationsgenerally restrict nonbank banks from commencing new activities of cross-marketingprograms with affiliates after March 5, 1987, increasing their assets atan annual rate of more than 7 percent during any 12-month period commencingafter August 10, 1988, or permitting overdrafts on behalf of affiliatesor incurring such overdrafts at a Federal Reserve Bank. 12 U.S.C. 1843(f)(2) and (3).To implement these limitations, the proposed rules: (1) Define the term``activity''; (2) clarify the scope of the cross-marketing limitation;(3) describe how the 7 percent annual asset growth rate will be computed;and (4) clarify the restriction on overdrafts.This proposed rulemaking also amends the definition of ``bank'' in RegulationY to correspond with the definition set forth in CEBA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before July 18, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments, which should refer to Docket No. R-0637,may be mailed to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,20th and C Streets NW., Washington, DC 20551, Attention: Mr. William Wiles,Secretary; or may be delivered to Boom B-2223 between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00p.m. All comments received at the above address will be included in thepublic file, and may be inspected at Room B-1122 between 9:00 a.m. and5:00 p.m.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>For information regarding andSection;andSection;225.2, 225.51, 225.52 and 225.145, contact J.

This new definition covers certaininstitutions that had not previously been covered by the BHC Act (``nonbankbanks``) and prevents banking and nonbanking companies from forming newnonbank banks.CEBA also contains a grandfather provision that permits a nonbanking companythat controlled a nonbank bank on March 5, 1987, to retain the nonbankbank and not be treated as a bank holding company if the company and itssubsidiary nonbank bank observe certain limitations designed to preventunfair competition with banks owned by bank holding companies and to reducerisks posed to the payments system by nonbank banks. With certain limitedexceptions, the grandfathered parent company may not acquire more than5 percent of the assets or shares of any additional bank or thrift institutionafter March 5, 1987, and the grandfathered nonbank bank may not_<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) engage in any activity after March 5, 1987, unless it was lawfullyengaged in that activity as of March 5, 1987; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) offer or market products or services of an affiliate that arenot permissible for bank holding companies under the BHC Act or permitits products or services to be offered or marketed by an affiliate engagedin activities not permissible for bank holding companies under the BHCAct, unless the specific cross-marketing activity was conducted as of March5, 1987, and then only in the same manner as conducted as of that date;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) permit an overdraft (including intraday overdrafts) by an affiliate,or incur an overdraft in its account at a Federal Reserve Bank on behalfof an affiliate; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) increase its assets at an annual rate of more than 7 percent duringany 12-month period beginning August 10, 1988.\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 12 U.S.C. 1843(f) (2) and (3).A grandfathered company must divest its nonbank bank within 180 days ifthe company or nonbank bank fails to comply with any of these limitations.12 U.S.C. 1843(f)(4).On August 21, 1987, the Board issued a Statement of Guidance (``Statement'')to assist affected companies in complying with CEBA's requirement to reportto the Board within 60 days of the statute's enactment regarding theirownership of a nonbank bank. Many of the companies filing these reportsraised several questions as to the meaning of CEBA's limitations as theyapply to the activities, cross-marketing programs, growth rate and overdraftsof grandfathered nonbank banks and asked the Board to initiate a rulemakingproceeding to implement these limitations. Accordingly, the Board is requestingcomment on the following proposed rules that address the issues and questionsraised regarding CEBA's limitations on nonbank banks.1. <T3>Activity limitation. </T3>As noted, CEBA restricts a nonbank bank tothose activities in which it was lawfully engaged as of March 5, 1987.A number of companies have asked for guidance on the meaning of the term``activity''. In light of the comments and data received and a carefulreview of the legislative history, the Board believes the term denotesany discrete line of banking or nonbanking business. In applying the definitionof activity, the proposed rule focuses on five major categories of activities:deposits, loans, trust services, payment and clearing services, and nonbankingactivities.<T3>Deposit Activities. </T3>The proposed rule provides that the followingdeposit-taking activities constitute separate lines of activity for purposesof CEBA: (1) Demand deposits; (2) non-demand deposits from which third-partypayments may be made generally; and (3) time or savings deposits. Thus,a nonbank bank that offered only time and savings deposits on March 5 couldnot begin to offer demand deposits.Some reporting comanies have commented to the Board that the activity limitationin CEBA intended no distinction between insured demand deposits and othertypes of deposits if they are also insured. As explained in the interpretiverule, this position is contrary to the express terms of the statute aswell as its legislative history. Under the BHC Act, a nonbank bank thatrefrained from offering demand deposits to avoid being a ``bank'' beforeCEBA could not begin to accept demand deposits after enactment of CEBA,because if it had accepted demand deposits on March 5, 1987, it would havebeen a bank in violation of the BHC Act. As noted, under CEBA a nonbankbank is limited to those activities in which it was <T3>lawfully </T3>engaged on March 5. The interpretation urged by thosecommenters would permit nonbank banks to convert themselves into full servicebanks by offering both demand deposits and commercial loans, a reuslt theSenate debates and Conference Report clearly state would not be permittedunder the activity limitations.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Comments of Senator Proxmire (floor manager), 133 Cong.Rec. S4054 (March 27, 1987); H. Rep. No. 100-261 100th Cong., 1st Sess.124-25 (1987).<T3>Lending Activities. </T3>For the same reasons a nonbank bank that makescommercial loans cannot accept demand deposits, a nonbank bank that acceptsdemand deposits but refrained form making commercial loans to avoid coverageunder the BHC Act before CEBA, as most of the nonbank banks did, wouldnot be permitted to begin to make commercial loans after CEBA. Such a nonbankbank could not have lawfully made commercial loans prior to CEBA and, therefore,cannot begin to make them after CEBA. The rule would define commercialloan consistent with the Report of Condition and the Supreme Court's decision,to include any loan to a business as well as loans to individuals for businesspurposes.The proposed rule delineates three lines of consumer lending activity forpurposes of CEBA: consumer lending, loans secured by the borrower's home,and credit card lending activities. As explained in the interpretive rule,this distinction draws upon the Board's bank holding company regulationby analogy. 12 CFR 225.25(b)(1). That regulation as well as the bank Reportof Condition treat these types of lending as distinct lines of activity.Under the proposed rule, home equity loans would be treated as a loan securedby the borrower's residence and not as a consumer loan.The proposed rule provides two additional categories of loans: loans todepository institutions and to state and local governments (but not includingthe purchase of their securities). To address questions raised by reportingcompanies, the proposed rule also defines the terms '`engaged in'' and``as of March 5, 1987'' as used in the activity limitation.<T3>Trust Activities. </T3>The proposed rule defines trust activities,in accordance with prior Board practice, as falling within the followingthree categories which provide properly separate activities: (1) Trustee,executor, or administrator for personal trusts and estates; (2) Trustee,investment advisor or investment manager for employee benefit plans; and(3) Corporate trust services, including acting as transfer, paying or fiscalagent.<T3>Clearing and Payment Services.</T3> Clearing and payment services reflecta depository institution's orientation toward either consumers or commercialentities. The proposed rule treats the following payment-related servicesas discrete activities: (1) Transaction services for consumer accounts;(2) transaction services for business accounts; (3) clearing or custodyof securities; (4) acting as a correspondent bank for other depositoryinstitutions; and (5) acting as a broker or dealer in government securities.<T3>Nonbanking Activities.</T3> Finally, consistent with the normal meaninggiven to the term ``activity'' under the BHC Act, the proposed rule treatsany separate line of nonbanking business as an activity. The proposed rulerefers to the list of permissible nonbanking activities under the Board'sRegulation Y as examples of separate lines of business activity. That regulationsets out 24 permissible nonbanking activities in broad categories (<T3>e.g.,</T3> data processing, discount securities brokerage, investmentadvisory services, leasing, management consulting, and foreign exchangeactivities). 12 CFR 225.25(b). The Board's rules also list other activitiesthat are not permissible but in which some banks engage under state law(<T3>e.g.,</T3> real estate development, real estate brokerage, and realestate syndication). 12 CFR 225.126. The proposed rule points out thata nonbank bank engaged on the grandfather date in one aspect of a nonbankingactivity (<T3>e.g.,</T3> leasing airplanes) could lease any type of product (<T3>e.g.,</T3> railroad cars).2.<T3> Cross-Marketing.</T3> CEBA's second limitation prohibits a grandfatherednonbank bank from engaging in certain cross-marketing activities with anaffiliate unless it was so engaged on the March 5, 1987, grandfather date.Unlike the activity limitation, which applies to separate lines of business,the cross-marketing limitation applies product-by-product and service-by-service.Thus, under the statute, nonbank bank may not offer or market the productsor services of an affiliate unless the product or service is one that abank holding company may offer, or allow one of its products or servicesto be offered or marketed by an affiliate engaged in activities not permissiblefor a bank holding company. There is an exception for products or servicesoffered or marketed on the grandfather date, but only ``in the same mannerin which they were being offered or marketed as of that date.'' To implementthis exception, the proposed rule provides that the means of offering ormarketing the product or service must remain the same as of the grandfatherdate. For example, an affiliate not using direct mailings as a marketingtechnique as of the grandfather date for a particular product or serviceof a nonbank bank may not commence this type of marketing after the grandfatherdate. The Board is seeking comment on the effect that this interpretationwould have on institutions conducting activities under the cross-marketingexception.The proposed interpretive rule, which will appear as 225.145, describesthe types of permissible cross-marketing permitted by CEBA. The rule alsopoints out that the cross-marketing limitation would not prohibit an affiliateof a nonbank bank that was marketing the bank's boat loans from continuingto market that type of loan product or from changing the specific termsand conditions of the loan. The affiliate could not, however, begin tooffer or market another product or service of the bank, such as a depositaccount, trust service, or a different loan product.The proposed rule also clarifies the scope of the grandfather exceptionto the cross-marketing provision and defines the terms ``offer or market''and ``as of March 5, 1987'' used in that provision.3.<T3> Seven Percent Annual Asset Growth Limitation.</T3> As noted, a nonbankbank'sasset growth under CEBA is limited to an annual rate of 7 percent duringany twelve-month period, beginning one year after the date of enactmentof CEBA, that is, beginning after August 10, 1988. A number of reportingcompanies raised questions about the application of this limitation.In the Statement, the Board indicated that it would use the average assetdata from call reports in determining compliance with this limitation inorder to minimize regulatory and reporting burden.\3\<NOTE/> The question has arisen, however, as to how the total assetsof the institution will be determined on August 10, 1988, the initial basedate for applying the limitation. The terms and legislative history ofCEBA indicate that during the one year period between August 10, 1987 (thedate of enactment of CEBA) and August 10, 1988, the 7 percent growth ratewould not be applicable. Accordingly, the proposed rule provides that thegrowth rate will apply only to periods commencing on or after August 10,1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Conference Report on CEBA directs the Board ``in determiningcompliance with the 7 percent growth rate, to utilize a procedure whichcomputes the grandfathered institution's growth rate on an average basis.''H. Rep. No. 100-261, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. 125 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28">Banking institutions with $100 million in assets or more must filewith their reports of condition their average total assets over the quartercalculated either on a daily basis or a weekly basis (</ITAG><T3>i.e.,</T3> an average of the Wednesday of each week of the quarter).Institutions with less than $100 million may report using an average offour month-end figures.The proposed rule provides two methods to determine the initial base forcomputing the growth rate. First, because, as discussed below, the proposedrule seeks to monitor compliance with the growth limit on a quarterly basisusing the call reports, the rule provides that the institution may chooseto use the average total assets reported on the call report for the quarterending September 30, 1988, as the initial base for measuing compliance,instead of its actual total assets on August 10, 1988. Use of the averageasset figure for the third quarter would avoid additional reports and monitoringproblems arising as a result of the growth rate limitation becoming effectivein the middle of a reporting quarter.The Board also seeks comment on an alternative which would permit the institution,if it chooses to use the total assets reported on its books on August 10,1988, as its initial base figure. If the nonbank wishes to use this figure,the proposed rule requires it to report to the Board this amount by September30, 1988, in order that the Board may monitor compliance with the growthlimitation. Under this alternative, compliance with the growth rate forthen initial 12-month period (August 10, 1988 to August 9, 1989) will bemeasured by comparing the bank's average total assets for the third quarterof 1989 with the bank's total assets on August 10, 1988.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Use of the average total assets for the third quarter1989 should very closely approximate total assets on August 10, 1989, whichdate falls very near the center of the third quarter. Under CEBA, the 7 percent annual growth rate is applied ``during any 12-monthperiod'' after August 10, 1988. The proposed rule would provide that thegrowth rate would be applied on a rolling 12-month basis, commencing forthose institutions electing to use the average assets for the third quarterof 1988 for the initial base, with the end of the third quarter of 1988(September 30, 1988). The initial 12-month period for these institutionswould expire with the close of the third quarter of 1989 (September 30,1989). Compliance with the growth rate over this initial 12-month periodwill be measured by comparing the average total assets reported for thethird quarter 1989 with the average total assets reported for the thirdquarter in the preceding year (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the 3rd quarter 1988).\5\<NOTE/> After this initial 12-month period, compliance would be measuredfor all nonbank banks quarterly by comparing the average total assets fromthe call report for each quarter after the 3rd quarter 1989 (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the 4th quarter 1989 <T3>et seq.</T3>) with the average total assets for the same quarter inthe preceding year (<T3>i.e.,</T3> 4th quarter 1988 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The quarterly monitoring would assure that distortionsresulting from seasonal fluctuations in asset growth during the year orwindow-dressing transactions would be avoided. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ For those institutions using the actual August 10, 1988figure, the initial 12-month period would commence on August 10, 1988 andexpire on August 9, 1989. Thereafter, compliance with the growth rate wouldbe measured over the same 12-month periods applicable to institutions thatchose to use the 3rd quarter of 1988 as their initial base. For example,for those institutions using the actual August 10, 1989 figure, the second12-month period would compare average total assets for the fourth quarterof 1989 with the average total assets for the 4th quarter of 1988. 4. <T3>Overdrafts.</T3> The fourth limitation on nonbank banks prohibits anonbank bank from permitting an overdraft for an affiliate and from incurringan overdraft in its account with a Federal Reserve Bank on behalf of anaffiliate.\6\<NOTE/> All overdrafts by affiliates in their accounts at nonbankbanks are prohibited by the statute.\7\<NOTE/> To implement the statutory language prohibiting overdraftson behalf of affiliates by nonbank banks at Federal Reserve Banks, theproposed rule provides that an overdraft by a nonbank bank in the nonbankbank's account at a Federal Reserve Bank shall be deemed to be on behalfof an affiliate whenever: (1) A nonbank bank holds an account for an affiliatefrom which third party payments can be made; and (2) the aggregate balanceof all of an affiliate's accounts with the nonbank bank is less, at thetime the nonbank bank incurred an overdraft in its account at a FederalReserve Bank, than the aggregate balance of all of the affiliate's accountsmaintained by the nonbank bank at the opening of business on the day onwhich the nonbank bank incurred the overdraft. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ CEBA excludes certain industrial banks from the definitionof ``bank'' in the BHC Act. This exemption is lost, however, if the industrialbank violates the overdraft restriction. The following discussion regardingnonbank banks also applies to industrial banks with the exception of theprimary dealer exemption which does not apply to industrial banks. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ This overdraft prohibition does not prevent nonbank banksfrom making loans to affiliates consistent with other laws, <T3>e.g.</T3>, sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, applicablebank lending limits, and CEBA's restriction on new activities. A nonbankbank that was not making commercial loans prior to March 5, 1987, wouldviolate the new activity restrictions of CEBA by making loans to affiliatesafter that date. Where a debit is posted to an account, overdraws the account,and is not covered by a loan at that time, it is an overdraft and not aloan. This proposed rule would define ``on behalf of an affiliate'' based onactivity in the affiliate's accounts at the nonbank bank. Whenever an affiliatedraws down or has drawn down the aggregate balance of all its accountsat the nonbank bank during the same time period that the nonbank bank incursan overdraft at its Reserve Bank, the overdraft will be deemed to be ``onbehalf of the affiliate.'' A transfer between an affiliate's accounts atthe nonbank bank would not affect the aggregate balance in the affiliate'saccounts. The affiliate would not necessarily have to overdraw an accountwith the nonbank bank for an overdraft at the Reserve Bank to be deemedto be on its behalf; rather, the debits posted to the aggregate of itsaccounts at the nonbank bank would only have to exceed the credits postedto the aggregate of its accounts on the day of the overdraft prior to orduring the time that the overdraft occurred. This proposed rule presumesthat any drawdown by an affiliate when the nonbank bank is overdrawn withthe Federal Reserve has contributed to the overdraft in the nonbank bank'saccount at its Reserve Bank, and therefore the overdraft at the ReserveBank is considered ``on behalf of the affiliate.'' To facilitate administrationof this rule, nonbank banks would be required to report to their ReserveBank accounts held for affiliates from which third party payments couldbe made. In addition to the CEBA overdraft restrictions, the Board is consideringimposing a zero ``cap'' for purposes of the Board's general risk reductionprogram on all nonbank banks that offer to their affiliates accounts withthird party payment capabilities. Under the risk reduction program overdraftsin excess of the zero cap would result in counseling by the Reserve Bankor other action as described in the Board's ``Policy Statement RegardingRisks on Larger-Dollar Wire Transfer Systems,'' 50 FR 21,120 (May 22, 1985),rather than divestiture under CEBA. The Board requests comments on theimposition of the zero cap. <T3>Posting. </T3>Posting is the procedure whereby the debit or creditadjustments resulting from payments transactions are made to the appropriateaccount. In order for nonbanks banks to avoid overdrafts at Reserve Banks,they must know when entries will be posted to their accounts. Similarly,posting rules are necessary to determine whether an overdraft has occurredat a nonbank bank. Without posting rules, nonbank banks could evade thepurpose of the statute by posting entries at such times of the day as tomask overdrafts. Accordingly, the Board is proposing posting rules fornonbank banks' Federal Reserve accounts and affiliates' accounts at nonbankbanks. These rules are designed solely to control risk in accordance with CEBA.They do not apply to depository institutions not covered by CEBA and arein addition to rules applicable to depository institutions' accounts atFederal Reserve Banks under the Board's general risk reduction policy.These rules differ from those incorporated in the Board's risk reductionpolicy because they focus solely on loss exposure and do not consider manipulationof cap capacity or other factors that are considered under the generalrisk reduction policy. <T3>Posting by Federal Reserve Banks. </T3>Under the proposed rules, ReserveBanks will post funds and book-entry securities transfers as they are made.For check, ACH, and noncash transactions, net settlement entries, and nonelectronictransactions, all credits will be posted as of the opening of businessand all debits at the close of business. With regard to discount window loans, the Board proposes to post creditsfor discount window loans as of the close of business on the day the loanis made, and to post debits for repayment of loans as of the close of businessat the maturity of the loan. This procedure differs from the posting rules used by the Board's ex postmonitoring system under the risk reduction program. Although the ex postmonitor method used in the risk reduction program is familiar to depositoryinstitutions, the Board believes that it is inappropriate to apply itsposting rules to nonbank banks for the purposes of applying the CEBA overdraftrestrictions. The ex post monitor posting rules were developed for a voluntaryprogram which does not involve the serious divestiture (or loss of exemption,in the case of industrial banks) consequences that result from an overdraftunder CEBA. In some cases, such as overdrafts due to certain ACH debits,divestiture based on the ex post monitor posting rules may be inequitable.The Board is continuing to review the ex post monitor in light of thisand other issues, but the posting rules adopted for purposes of CEBA monitoringshould not be considered a precedent for any revisions to the ex post monitor.In addition to the posting rules, Reserve Banks will pay particular attentionto depository transfer checks and ACH cash concentration debits used byaffiliates of nonbank banks. These transactions are likely to present risksthat are not addressed by the proposed posting rules. For example, wherean affiliate of a nonbank bank deposits depository transfer checks witha nonbank bank in order to transfer funds to its account at the nonbankbank from its account at another depository institution, it is likely thatthe check will be returned in the event of failure of the affiliate. Failureof the affiliate, in turn, may precipitate failure of the nonbank bank.The returned check will come back to the Federal Reserve after the daywhen the credits for these transactions are posted to a nonbank bank'saccount, and therefore the risks presented by these returns are not addressedby posting rules. Consequently, where appropriate to protect against riskof return of these transactions, nonbank banks may be required to establisha special clearing balance at their Reserve Bank to be maintained at alltimes at a sufficient level to protect against these risks.<T3>Posting by Grandfathered Banks. </T3>Because depository institutions'rights with respect to their customers differ from the rights that a ReserveBank has with respect to transactions that it processes, particularly inthe area of check and ACH transactions, the posting rules do not requirenonbank banks to post all transactions for CEBA monitoring purposes atthe same time that the transactions are posted by Reserve Banks. The Boardproposes to permit nonbank banks to post checks and ACH transfers at anytime during the day of the transaction_<T3>i.e.</T3>, settlement day for ACH transactions or the day of presentmentor credit to the nonbank bank for check transactions_so long as debitsare posted no later than the time that the nonbank bank's account at theReserve Bank is debited for the transaction for purposes of CEBA overdraftmonitoring, and credits are posted no earlier than the time when the creditfor the transaction is posted to the nonbank bank's account for the purposesof CEBA overdraft monitoring. Accordingly, nonbank banks may keep two setsof books for posting: one for affiliates and another for the rest of itscustomers. No posting to an affiliate's account is necessary if a nonbankbank returns a check or an ACH debit transfer in accordance with applicablelaw.<T3>Exemptions.</T3> CEBA provides two exemptions from the restrictionon overdrafts. One exemption is for overdrafts on behalf of an affiliatethat is a primary dealer, where the overdraft is fully secured; \8\<NOTE/> and the other exemption is for inadvertent computer or inadvertentaccounting errors that are beyond the control of both the grandfatheredbank and the affiliate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ This exemption does not aply to industrial banks.<T3>Primary Dealers.</T3> CEBA defines a primary dealer as one that isrecognized as a primary dealer by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Currently, there are 42 such primary dealers, but only eight are affiliatedwith nonbank banks. Some of these eight primary dealers do not currentlyclear book-entry securities transfers through their nonbank banks.CEBA does not prohibit primary dealers from incurring overdrafts at affiliatednonbank banks and the affiliated nonbank banks from incurring overdraftsat their Federal Reseve Bank on behalf of the primary dealer affiliate,provided that these overdrafts are fully secured, ``as required by theBoard, by bonds, notes, or other obligations which are direct obligationsof the United States or on which the principal and interest are fully guaranteedby the United States or by securities and obligations eligible for settlementon the Federal Reserve Book entry system.'' \9\<NOTE/> The proposed regulation defines ``fully secured'' as securedby a fully perfected security interest in specific, identified obligationslisted in the statute with a market value that, in the Reserve Bank's judgment,is sufficiently in excesss of the amount of the overdraft to provide amargin of protection against a volatile market or the chance that the securitieswould need to be liquidated quickly.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ An overdraft is on behalf of a primary dealer affiliateonly to the extent that the primary dealer has drawn down its accountsat the nonbank bank on that day.The Board is considering establishing a cap or ceiling on the level ofsecurities-related overdrafts to be permitted by any one nonbank bank.Such a cap would be set through self-evaluation procedures similar to thoseused in the risk reduction program, and nonbank banks exceeding the capwould be counseled or subject to other action by their Federal ReserveBank, in accordance with the Board's risk reduction policy. The Board requestscomment on the appropriateness of establishing such a cap. Although CEBAexempts secured primary dealer overdrafts from the overdraft restrictions,the legislative history of DEBA clearly indicates that Congress was notconfering a right to overdrafts at the Federal Reserve on primary dealers.Nonbank banks affiliated with primary dealers may have limited abilitiesto fund themselves in the markets and therefore may place undue relianceon access to the discount window or otherwise unnecessary requests forextensions of Fedwire to complete deliveries of inventories of securitiesthat it is not able to fund overnight.<T3>Inadvertent Errors.</T3> CEBA also exempts from the overdraft restrictionsthose overdrafts resulting from inadvertent computer or inadvertent accountingerrors that are beyond the control of both the nonbank and the affiliate.The proposed regulation defines such inadvertent errors as those resultingin an overdraft that was not reasonably foreseeable or preventable by thenonbank bank or the affiliate. A misposting of an entry by a Reserve Bankwould not result in an overdraft in a nonbank's account because no extensionof credit had been made. Similarly, a misposting of an entry by a nonbankbank to an affiliate's account would not result in an overdraft.Inadvertent computer errors would include problems where a nonbank bankor affiliate could not avoid book-entry securities overdrafts from inboundsecurities transfers, because it could not originate off-setting outboundtransfers of securities or where a nonbank bank received a book-entry securitiestransaction sent to it in error. On the other hand, if a Federal ReserveBank's computer should go down so as to prevent a Fedwire funds transferfrom being sent to the nonbank bank, any overdraft due to outbound Fedwirefunds transfers would be within the control of the nonbank bank, becausethe nonbank bank could have waited until it had sufficient funds in itsaccount to cover the outbound transfer.5. <T3>Other Issues:</T3> Four nonbank banks that had not commenced businessas of the date of enactment of CEBA filed reports with the Board claiminggrandfather rights under CEBA. The proposed rule states that these institutionsdo not qualify for grandfather rights under the terms of CEBA.In order to be entitled to grandfather rights under CEBA, the nonbank bankmust have become a bank as a result of enactment of CEBA and may only engagein activities in which it was engaged on March 5, 1987. An institutionthat was not FDIC-insured and did not accept demand deposits or make commercialloans on the March 5 grandfather date or on August 10, 1987, the date ofenactment of CEBA, would not have become a bank as a result of enactmentof CEBA. Thus, it would not be entitled to grandfather rights. Indeed,even if the nonbank bank somehow were entitled to grandfather rights, itsactivities would be limited to those in which it was lawfully engaged onMarch 5. On that date, the four nonbank banks had not commenced operationsand therefore were not engaged in any activities. Thus, they could notthereafter commence any activities without loss of their grandfather privileges.Finally, the rule notes that under the terms of CEBA, a company that controlsa nonbank bank would lose its grandfather status if it or the subsidiarybank acquires an additional bank or thrift or violates the activity limitationsin CEBA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis </ITAG>Of the items required to be obtained in an initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis by 5 U.S.C. 603(b), the first (``a description of the reasonswhy action by the agency is being considered'') and the second (``a succinctstatement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the proposed rule'')are found elsewhere in this preamble.The proposed rule contains reporting and record-keeping requirements forpurposes of measuring overdrafts and annual growths. CEBA requires theBoard to enforce the prohibition on overdrafts and the limit on annualgrowth enacted by CEBA. To do so, the Board must have a means of measuringthose overdrafts and the annual growth. The Board proposes that all ofthese requirements be applicable to all nonbank banks and industrial bankssubject to the rule regardless of size. The small entities most likelyto be affected by this rulemaking are the industrial banks that are subjectto the limitations on overdrafts. According to Board records on overdraftsunder the current risk reduction policy, however, very few industrial banksreporting to the Board have incurred overdrafts since the enactment ofCEBA. Thus, it does not appear that a substantial number of industrialbanks will be affected by the rule. The Board considered exempting smallbanks from the rule's requirements, but CEBA does not provide an exemptionaccording to the size of the nonbank bank or industrial bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 225</ITAG>Banks, Banking, Federal Reserve System, Holding companies, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements, Securities.For the reasons set out in this notice, and pursuant to the Board's authorityunder section 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1844),the Board proposes to amend 12 CFR Part 225 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 225_BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL</ITAG>1.

CEBA alsocontained a grandfather provision for certain companies affected by thisredefinition. CEBA amended section 4 of the BHC Act to permit a companythat on March 5, 1987, controlled a nonbank bank (an institution that becamea bank as a result of enactment of CEBA) and that was not a bank holdingcompany on August 9, 1987, to retain its nonbank bank and not be treatedas a bank holding company for purposes of the BHC Act if the company andits subsidiary nonbank bank observe certain limitations imposed by CEBA.\1\<NOTE/> These limitations are codified in sections 4(f)(2) and (3)of the BHC Act and generally restrict nonbank banks from commencing newactivities or cross-marketing programs with affiliates after March 5, 1987,increasing their assets at an annual rate exceeding 7 percent during any12 month period after August 10, 1988, or permitting overdrafts on behalfof affiliates or incurring such overdrafts at a Federal Reserve Bank. 12U.S.C. 1843(f)(2) and (3). CEBA also prohibits, with certain limited exceptions,a company controlling a grandfathered nonbank bank from acquiring directlyor indirectly after March 5, 1987, more than 5 percent of the assets orshares of a bank or thrift institution. During the course of the Board'sconsideration of the reports required by CEBA to be filed with the Boardby companies that controlled nonbank banks on March 5, 1987, several questionsarose as to the scope of these limitations. The Board's views regardingthese questions are set forth below and in Subpart F of Regulation Y. (12CFR Part 225). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 12 U.S.C. 1843(f). Such a company is treated as a bankholding company, however, for purposes of the anti-tying provisions insection 106 of the BHC Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1971 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and the insider lending limitations of section 22(h)of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 375b). The company is also subjectto certain examination and enforcement provisions to assure compliancewith CEBA.(b) <T3>Congressional Findings. </T3>At the outset, the Board notes that thescope and application of the Act's limitations on nonbank banks must beguided by the Congressional findings set out in section 4(f)(3) of theBHC Act. In that section, Congress found that nonbank banks controlledby grandfathered companies, because of their relationships with affiliates,may be involved in conflicts of interest, concentration of resources, orother effects adverse to bank safety and soundness. Congress also foundthat nonbank banks may be able to compete unfairly against banks controlledby bank holding companies by combining banking services with financialservices not permissible for bank holding companies. Accordingly, section4(f)(3) states that the purpose of the nonbank bank limitations is to minimizeany potential adverse effects or inequities by restricting the activitiesof nonbank banks until further Congressional action in the area of bankpowers could be undertaken. Similarly, the Senate Report accompanying CEBAstates that the restrictions CEBA places on nonbank banks ``will help preventexisting nonbank banks from changing their basic character * * * whileCongress considers proposals for comprehensive legislation; from drasticallyeroding the separation of banking and commerce; and from increasing thepotential for unfair competition, conflicts of interest, undue concentrationof resources, and other adverse effects.'' S. Rep. No. 100-19, 100th Cong.,1st Sess. 12 (1987). See also H. Rep. No. 100-261, 100th Cong., 1st Sess.124 (1987), (the ``Conference Report''). (c) <T3>Activity Limitation_</T3>(1) <T3>Activity Defined. </T3>The first limitation established under section4(f)(3) restricts a nonbank bank to those activities in which it was lawfullyengaged as of March 5, 1987. Consistent with the terms and purposes ofthe legislation and the explicit Congressional directive to minimize potentialadverse potential adverse effects or inequities by limiting the activitiesof grandfathered nonbank banks, the Board believes that the term activity''in this limitation means any line of banking or nonbanking business. Thisdefinition does not, however, envision a product-by-product approach tothe activity limitation. The Board believes it would be helpful to setout the considerations it will take into account in applying the activitylimitation of section 4(f)(3) in the context of the following major categoriesof bank activities: deposit-taking, lending, trust or fiduciary services,clearing or payment services, and other types of activities engaged inby banks. (2) <T3>Types of Deposit-Taking Activities. </T3>With respect to deposit-taking,the Board believes that there would generally be at least three distincttypes of activity for purposes of section 4(f)(3): Demand deposits, otheraccounts with general third party payment powers, such as NOW accounts,and time and savings accounts without general third party payment powers.In reaching this conclusion, the Board has relied on the fact that theBHC Act's definition of ``bank'' itself distinguishes between demand deposit-taking,non-demand transaction accounts, and other forms of deposit activities.Moreover, it is clear from the terms and intent of CEBA that the activitylimitation in section 4(f)(3) would prevent, and was designed to prevent,nonbank banks that prior to the enactment of CEBA had refrained from acceptingdemand deposits in order to avoid coverage as a ``bank'' under the BHCAct, from starting to take these deposits after enactment of CEBA and thusbecoming full-service banks.(3) <T3>Demand Deposit-Taking Activity. </T3>Under the activity limitation,a nonbank bank may engage only in activities in which it was ``lawfullyengaged'' as of March 5, 1987. Because the nonbank bank could not havebeen engaged lawfully on March 5, 1987, in both demand deposit and commericallending activity, the nonbank bank could not thereafter commence the demanddeposit-taking or commerical lending activity that it did not conduct onMarch 5, 1987. The legislative history of this provision confirms thisreading. Both the Senate and the Conference Reports regarding CEBA statethat this provision confining nonbank banks to activities in which theywere lawfully engaged on March 5, 1987, would ``prevent[ing] the nonbankbank from, for example, both offering demand deposits and engaging in thebusiness of making commercial loans * * *''. H. Rep. No. 100-261 at 124-25;S. Rep. No. 100-19 at 32. The Board notes that absent this interpretationa nonbank bank that acceptd only savings and time deposits and made bothconsumer and commercial loans could, contrary to the stated purpose ofthe CEBA, convert itself into a full-service bank. For these reasons, theBoard concludes that the term ``activity'' in section 4(f)(3) differentiatesbetween demand deposits and other types of deposit activity and that aninstitution that accepted only time and savings deposits as of March 5,1987, would be engaged in a new activity if it began to accept demand depositsafter that date. (4) <T3>Transaction Accounts. </T3>Similarly, the Board considers nondemanddeposits withdrawable without restriction by check or other similar meansto constitute a separate line of business for purposes of applying theactivity limitation in section 4(f)(3). Thus, an institution that on March5, 1987, offered only time and savings accounts that were not withdrawableby check could not thereafter begin a transaction account business by offering,for example, NOW accounts or other types of transaction accounts. In thisregard, the Board notes that historically the provision of checking accountshas been viewed as a separate activity and in the past served to differentiatecommercial banks and thrifts institutions, industrial banks and similarinstitutions. The conduct of this activity also involves different expertiseand technical programs than is involved in offering non-checking savingsand time deposits. As noted above, the definition of bank in the BHC Actas amended by CEBA also itself distinguishes between demand deposits, transactionaccounts and other non-checkable deposits. (5) <T3>Lending Activities Generally. </T3>With respect to lending activity,CEBA and the BHC Act also distinguish between commerical and consumer lendingand, in the Board's view, these types of lending constitute separate anddistinct lines of business or activity for purposes of CEBA. Under thedefinition of ``bank'' in the BHC Act in effect both prior to and afterenactment of CEBA, a nonbank bank that offered demand deposits and madeconsumer loans could not engage in the business of making commercial loanswithout losing its nonbank bank status. Thus, insofar as the bank definitionis concerned, commerical lending is an activity separate and apart fromother types of lending. (6) <T3>Commerical Lending Activity. </T3>As noted, the activity limitationin section 4(f)(3) of CEBA would prevent a nonbank bank from both offeringdemand deposits and engaging in the business of making commercial loanssince such an institution could not have been ``lawfully engaged'' in bothof these activities on March 5, 1987, insofar as the BHC Act is concerned.Moreover, in order for the activity restriction to achieve its stated legislativepurpose of preventing a nonbank bank from offering both demand depositsand commerical loans (H. Rep. No. 100-261 at 124-25), the term ``activity''in section 4(f)(3) must differentiate between commerical and consumer lending.Otherwise, there would be nothing to prevent a nonbank bank that accepteddeposits and made consumer but not commerical loans as of March 5, 1987,as many of the nonbank banks stated in their CEBA reports, from commencingthis activity after that date without loss of grandfather privileges underCEBA. Accordingly, the Board concludes that such a nonbank bank would beengaged in a new activity if it began to make commerical loans after thatdate and would lose its entitlement to grandfather rights under CEBA. (7) <T3>Legislative History. </T3>The Board notes that the legislative historyof a predecessor to this provision of CEBA states that the activity limitationfor nonbank banks was intended ``to prevent an institution engaged in alimited range of functions from expanding into new areas and becoming,in essence, a full-service bank''. H. Rep. No. 99-175, 99th Cong., 1stSess. 13 (1985). The House Report goes on to state that, ``[t]hus, in particulara nonbank bank that is a `consumer bank' (i.e., it engaged in no commericallending to avoid the existing definition of bank) would not be permittedto begin to engage in commerical lending after being grandfathered underthis Act.'' <T3>Id.</T3>(8) <T3>Other Types of Consumer Lending Activity. </T3>The proposed rule differentiatesbetween three distinct lines of consumer lending activity for purposesof CEBA: consumer lending, loans secured by the borrower's residence, andcredit card lending activities. This distinction between types of specializedlending is reflected in the Board's regulations that specify the typesof lending activities permissible for bank holding companies. Section 225.25(b)(1)of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.25(b)(1)) reflects the separatetypes of lending activity conducted by specialized companies offering consumerloans, credit cards, mortgage loans and commerical finance. The Board believesthat a credit card business as well as home mortgage lending are recognized,discrete lines of business activity. Indeed, CEBA itself recognizes a distinctionin the case of credit card activity by creating a specific exemption fromthe bank definition for banks that engage only in credit card operations.The Board has also approved a number of proposals by bank holding companiesto establish specialized credit card banks, and has long permitted bankholding companies to engage in the mortgage lending business as a separateline of business activity. In light of existing law, industry practiceand the legislative history of CEBA, the Board concludes that credit cardlending and lending secured by the borrower's residence would constituteseparate lines of lending activity for purposes of applying the limitationon nonbank bank activities in section 4(f)(3). Thus, a nonbank bank thatwas engaged in consumer lending activity as of March 5, but did not engagein home mortgage lending or credit card lending would not be able to commencethese activities after March 5 without loss of its grandfather benefitsunder CEBA. (9) <T3>Change in Types of Consumer Loans Permitted</T3>. This interpretationof the term ``activity'' would not prohibit a bank that was offering onetype of consumer loan on the grandfather date from offering a differenttype of consumer loan thereafter. For example, a bank that offered consumerautomobile loans on the grandfather date could offer consumer boat loansthereafter, but could not commence a mortgage lending business or creditcard business unless it was so engaged on March 5, 1987. See H. Rep. No99-175, <T3>supra </T3>at 13 (a grandfathered nonbank bank could offer a customera consumer loan to purchase a boat even if no such loans were outstandingon the grandfather date, if other consumer loans, such as consumer loansto purchase a car, were outstanding on that date). Similarly, a nonbankbank that was lawfully engaged in the commercial lending business as ofMarch 5, 1987, could offer any type of commercial loan thereafter and wouldnot be limited to the precise types of commercial loans offered on March5.(10) <T3>Definition of Commercial Loans</T3>. For purpose of the activity limitation,the Board believes the term ``commercial loan'' should include loans tosole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations and other business enterprises,whether secured or unsecured, as defined in Schedule RC-C of the reportof condition, as well as commercial real estate loans, and agriculturalloans, and loans to individuals for the purposes other than personal, family,household, or charitable purposes. It should be noted, however, that thenonbank bank could not engage in other types of lending, such as issuanceof standby letters of credit of foreign exchange. The determination asto whether other types of lending or lending-type activity would constitutea new activity would depend upon the characteristics of the lending activityand should not be commenced without discussion with the Board.(11) <T3>Loans to Depository Institutions</T3>. Loans to depository institutionsare not included under the activity ``commercial loan,'' but would constitutea separate and distinct activity. This lending activity constitutes a uniqueservice, generally referred to as the federal funds market, in which alltypes of depository institutions participate. It has traditionally beentreated separately from the commercial lending market and the Board believesit should continue to be regarded as a separate and distinct activity.(12) <T3>Trust Activities</T3>. With respect to trust activities, the Boardhas traditionally viewed these activities as falling within three maincategories: trustee, executor, or administrator for personal trusts andestates; trustee, investment advisor, or investment manager for employeebenefit plans; and corporate trust services, including voting as transfer,paying or fiscal agent. Accordingly, these lines of activity would properlyconstitute separate activities under section 4(f) (3).(13) <T3>Clearing and Payment Activities</T3>. Clearing and payments servicesalso include several distinct activities. These activities reflect, inpart, a depository institution's orientation toward either consumer orcommercial entities. Accordingly, the Board considers the following payment-relatedservices to be examples of discrete activities: transaction services forconsumer accounts; transaction services for business accounts; clearingor custody of securities; clearing merchant credit card drafts; and actingas a correspondent bank for other depository institutions.(14) <T3>Transaction Services</T3>. Transaction services for consumer accountsinclude but are not limited to check-based payment services, receivingpreauthorized transactions (e.g. automated clearinghouse transactions),limited funds transfers (<T3>e.g. </T3>through Fedwire or CHIPS), and providing consumers accessto a point-of-sale network. Transaction services for business accountsinclude, but are not limited to, check-based payment services, originatingand receiving preauthorized transactions (e.g. automated clearinghousetransactions), funds transfers (e.g. through Fedwire or CHIPS), and operatinga point-of-sale network for the use of business customers. The distinctionbetween consumer transaction services and business transaction servicesis consistent with the distinction in the BHC Act between commercial andconsumer lending.(15) <T3>Securities Clearing and Custody</T3>. The Board considers clearingand custody of securities, unrelated to trust activities, as a safekeepingor agency activity involving investment instruments and therefore an activityseparate and different from funds based transaction services.(16) <T3>Correspondent Services</T3>. The Board considers providing correspondentservices to other depository institutions. (17) <T3>Nonbanking Activities</T3>. With respect to other types of nonbankingactivity, section 4(f) (3) would not permit a grandfathered nonbank bankto expand into new business activities. Thus, for example, a grandfatherednonbank bank could not commence after March 5, 1987, any new types of nonbankingactivities, including, for example, discount securities brokerage, fullservice securities brokerage for financially sophisticated customers, investmentadvisory services, acting as a broker or dealer in government securitiesor other bank-eligible securities, acting as an underwriter in governmentsecurities, foreign exchange advisory or transaction services, personalproperty leasing, real property leasing, data processing for third parties,insurance agency activities, insurance underwriting, management consulting,futures commission merchant, or any of the other types of nonbanking activitieslisted in andSection; 225.25(b) of Regulation Y or that have been determinedto be impermissible for bank holding companies (e.g. real estate investmentand development or real estate syndication). A nonbank bank engaged onthe grandfather date in one aspect of nonbanking activity (<T3>e.g. </T3>leasing airplanes) could commence leasing any type of product(<T3>e.g. </T3>railroad cars).(18) <T3>Meaning of ``Engaged in''. </T3>In order to be ``engaged in'' an activity,a nonbank bank must demonstrate that it had a program in place to providea particular product or service associated with the grandfathered activitiyto a customer and that it was in fact offering the product or service tothe customer as of March 5, 1987. Thus, a nonbank bank is not engaged inan activity as of March 5, 1987, if the product or service in questionwas in a planning state as of that date but had not been offered or deliveredto a customer. Consistent with prior Board interpretations of the termactivity in the grandfather provisions of section 4, the Board does notbelieve that a company may be engaged in an activity on the basis of asingle isolated transaction. For example, a nonbank bank that held an interestin a single real estate project would not thereby be engaged in real estatedevelopment for purposes of this provision, unless evidence was presentedindicating the interest was held under a program to commence real estateinvestment or development business. (19) <T3>Meaning of ``As of''.</T3> The board believes that the grandfatherdate ``as of March 5, 1987'' as used throughout section 4(f)(3) shouldrefer to activities engaged in on March 5, 1987, or a reasonably shortperiod preceding this date not exceeding thirteen months. Activities thatthe institution had terminated prior to March 5, 1988, however, would notbe considered to have been conducted or engaged in ``as of'' March 5. Moreover,in order for the activity to qualify as being conducted ``as of'' March5, it must have been conducted while the institution was a nonbank bank.Activities conducted while the institution was a full-service bank butnot after it was converted to a nonbank bank, would not be permissiblefor the nonbank bank even if the activity had been conducted within a fewmonths of March 5, 1987.(d) Cross-Marketing Activity_(1) <T3>In General. </T3>Section 4(F)(3) also limits cross-marketing activitiesby nonbank banks and their affiliates. Under this provision, a nonbankbank may not offer or market a product or service of an affiliate unlessthe product or service may be offered by bank holding companies generallyunder section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. In addition, a nonbank bank may notpermit any of its products or services to be offered or marketed by orthrough a nonbank affiliate unless the affiliate engages only in activitiespermissible for a bank holding company under section 4(c)(8). These limitationsare subject to an exception for products or services that were being sooffered or marketed as of March 5, 1987, but only in the same manner inwhich they were being offered or marketed as of the grandfather date. (2) <T3>Examples of Impermissible Cross-Marketing.</T3> The Conference Reortillustrates the application of this limitation to the following two coveredtransactions: (i) products and services of an affiliate that are not permissibleunder the BHC Act, and (ii) products and services of the nonbank bank.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In the first case, the restrictions would prohibit, for example, acompany from marketing life insurance or automotive supples through itsaffiliate nonbank bank because these products are not generally permissibleunder the BHC Act. H. Rep. NO. 100-261 <T3>supra </T3>at 126. In the second case, a nonbank bank may not permitits products or services to be offered or marketed through a life insuranceaffiliate or automobile parts retailer because these affiliates engagein activities prohibited under the BHC Act. <T3>Id. </T3>(3) <T3>Permissible Cross-Marketing. </T3>On the ther hand, a nonbank bankcould offer to its customers consumer loans from an affiliated mortgagebanking or consumer finance company. These affiliates could likewise offertheir customers the nonbank bank's products or services provided the affiliatesengaged only in activities permitted for bank holding companies under theclosely-related to banking standard of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act.If the affiliate is engaged in both permissible and impermissible activitieswithin the meaning of section 4 (c)(8) of the BHC Act, the affiliates couldnot offer or market the nonbank bank's products or services. (4) <T3>Product Approach to Cross-Marketing Restriction. </T3>Unlike the activityrestrictions, the cross-marketing restrictions of CEBA apply by their termsto individual products and services. Thus, an affiliate of a nonbank bankengaged in nonbanking activites that are not permissible for bank holdingcompanies that was marketing a particular product or service of a nonbankbank on the grandfather date could continue to market that product and,as discussed below, could change the terms and conditions of the loan.The nonbank affiliate could not, however, begin to offer or market anotherproduct or service of the nonbank bank such as a deposit account, trustservice or a different type of loan product (unless the affiliate engagedonly in permissible activities as described in paragraph (d)(3) of thissection. Thus, a securities underwriting company that as of March 5, 1987,offered or marketed to its customers automobile loans from an affiliatednonbank bank could not begin to offer or market to its customers checkingaccounts from the bank without losing its grandfather privileges underCEBA.(5) <T3>Change in Terms and Conditions Permitted. </T3>The cross-marketingrestrictions would not, however, limit the ability of the institution tochange the specific terms and conditions of the particular grandfatheredproduct or service. The Conference Report indicates a legislative intentnot to lock into place the specific terms or conditions of a grandfatheredproduct or service. For example, a nonbank bank marketing a three-year,$5,000 certificate of deposit through an affiliate under the exemptioncould offer a one-year $2,000 certificate of deposit with a different interestrate after the grandfather date. Modifications that alter the type of product,however, are not permitted. Thus, a nonbank bank that marketed throughaffiliates on March 5, 1987, only certificates of deposit could not commencemarketing MMDA's or NOW accounts after the grandfather date.(6) <T3>Grandfather Provision for Cross-Marketing. </T3>A product or servicenot permissible for bank holding companies under section 4(c)(8) of theBHC Act would nevertheless be permitted to be offered or marketed by anonbank bank under the cross-marketing provisions of section 4(f)(3) undercertain conditions if they were offered or marketed as of the March 5,1987 grandfather date. In the Board's opinion, the terms ``offered or marketed''in the cross-marketing restrictions refer to the presentation to a customerof an institution's products or service through any type of program, includingtelemarketing, advertising brochures, direct mailing, personal solicitation,customer referrals, or joint marketing agreements or presentations. Aninstitution must have offered or actually marketed the product or serviceon March 5 or shortly before that date (as discussed above) to qualifyfor the grandfather privilege. Thus, if the cross-marketing program wasin the planning stage on March 5, 1987, the program would not qualify forgrandfather treatment under CEBA.(7) <T3>Limitations on Cross-marketing to ``in the same manner''. </T3>Underthe cross-marketing provision, products or services qualifying for grandfathertreatment may continue to be offered or marketed but only ``in the samemanner'' in which they were offered or marketed as of March 5, 1987. Thus,the means of offering or marketing the products or services must remainthe same as on the grandfather date. Accordingly, an affiliate not usingdirect mailings as a marketing technique as of the grandfather date fora particular product or service of the nonbank bank may not commence thistype of marketing after the grandfather date. (8) <T3>Eligibility for Cross-Marketing Grandfather Exemption. </T3>The ConferenceReport also clarifies that entitlement to an exemption is specific to aninstitution. An affiliate that was not engaged in cross-marketing productsor services as of the grandfather date may not commence these activitiesunder the exemption even if such activities were being conducted by anotheraffiliate.(e) <T3>Eligibility for Grandfathered Nonbank Bank Status. </T3>In reviewingthe CEBA reports, the Board notes that a number of institutions that hadnot commenced business operations on August 10, 1987, the date of enactmentof CEBA, claimed grandfather privileges under section 4(f)(3) of CEBA.To qualify for grandfather privileges under section 4(f)(3), the institutionmust have ``bec[o]me a bank as a result of the enactment of [CEBA]'' andmust have been controlled by a nonbanking company on March 5, 1987. 12U.S.C. 1843(f)(1)(A). An institution that did not have GDIC insurance onAugust 10, 1987, and that did not accept demand deposits or transactionaccounts or engage in the business of commercial lending on that date,would not have become a ``bank'' as a result of enactment of CEBA. Thus,institutions that had not commenced operations on August 10, 1987, couldnot qualify for grandfather privileges under section 4(f)(3) of CEBA. Thisview is supported by the activity limitations of section 4(f)(3), which,as noted, limit the activities of grandfathered nonbank banks to thosein which they were lawfully engaged as of March 5, 1987. A nonbank bankthat had not commenced conducting business activities on March 5, 1987,could not after enactment of CEBA engage in any activities under this provision.(f) <T3>Enforcement of Nonbank Bank Limitations. </T3>The Board notes thatenforcement of the limitations on nonbank banks is specified in section4(f)(4) of the BHC Act. Under that section, the grandfather provisionsin section 4(f)(1) of this Act cease to apply if a nonbank bank subsidiaryfails to comply with the limitations in section 4(f)(3). In that event,the Act requires the grandfathered company to ``divest control of eachbank it controls within 180 days after such company becomes a bank holdingcompany due to the loss of such exemption.''<ITAG tagnum="21">Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
