Ansin, who runs WSVN-TV here, doesn't sound like a man who stands to lose millions of dollars.    In his typically understated way, Mr. Ansin tells of National Broadcasting Co.'s plan to buy the local CBS-affiliated station and then award it the NBC affiliation his station has had for 25 years. Because of NBC's high ratings, the move could result in a drop of $75 million to $200 million in WSVN's market value, according to some estimates. WSVN has the largest viewership of any U.S. station owned by one person.    &quot;I think there are lots of things wrong with this situation,&quot; Mr. Ansin comments.    But Mr. Ansin, a tall multimillionaire -- Forbes magazine says he is worth $200 million and is one of America's 400 richest people -- has shed his reticence to fight NBC tooth and nail to prevent the sale. The battle is being closely watched by broadcasters because it marks, among other things, the first time in broadcast history that one network has sought to purchase another's affiliate.    Seeking the bigger profits that come from owning a station rather than affiliating with one, NBC and another General Electric Co. unit last January announced they were buying CBS affiliate WTVJ-Channel 4, for $270 million. The seller is Wometco Broadcasting Co., controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York investment concern.    Since then, the 51-year-old Mr. Ansin, who normally keeps the lowest of public profiles, has fired off news releases and gone on the air on his own station to denounce NBC's plan, which was announced just 16 days after Mr. Ansin's station renewed its NBC affiliation contract for two years. Mr. Ansin lodged a challenge with the Federal Communications Commission and has shuttled back and forth between Washington and Miami to garner political backing. Florida Gov. Bob Martinez and six of the state's congressmen, including Dante Fascell and the influential Claude Pepper, wrote letters stating their concern to the FCC, which must approve the sale.    Nevertheless, WSVN's future is still very much in the air. If NBC's purchase is approved, WSVN would lose its affiliation with the network when its contract expires Jan. 1, 1989. At that point, WSVN could either affiliate with another network -- most probably CBS -- or it could become an independent. Either choice, Mr. Ansin says, would reduce the station's sale value by millions of dollars.    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst for New York-based Oppenheimer andamp; Co., says going independent would knock $200 million off the station's sale value. Howard E. Stark, a television station broker, puts the figure at $150 million. Mr. Ansin currently values WSVN at $350 million to $400 million.    Mr. Ansin says he thinks the other option, affiliating with No. 2-ranked CBS, would mean a sizable loss in advertising revenue and ratings that would translate into a loss in value of about $75 million.    NBC's move has created an &quot;inherently anti-competitive&quot; situation, he charges. &quot;General Motors can't come in and sell Fords across the street from a Chevrolet dealer,&quot; says Mr. Ansin, using his favorite analogy. &quot;It's a bizarre situation.&quot; NBC says it doesn't believe that the purchase is anti-competitive and intends to &quot;live up fully to the letter and the spirit of the contract with WSVN.&quot; NBC says that if WSVN doesn't cancel its recently signed NBC-affiliation contract, the network would run its newly acquired station as an independent until the contract expires in 1989.    The television picture in Miami is further clouded by the existence of an independent television station, WCIX-Channel 6, which has a widely received VHF signal. Since NBC's announcement, CBS, which has in the past expressed interest in buying its affiliate or Mr. Ansin's station, has also been in talks with WCIX. &quot;At one time, CBS was saying let's get together and talk about the situation,&quot; says Mr. Ansin. &quot;Then they said we can't talk right now because we are considering buying Channnel 6.&quot; CBS says it has suspended talks with both Channel 6 and Mr. Ansin's Channel 7 until the FCC rules on the case. &quot;Our goal would be to maintain CBS affiliation in Miami,&quot; a spokesman says.    All this hoopla is new for the normally publicity-shy Mr. Ansin, who drives a leased Buick Park Avenue, lives in a one-bedroom condominium in North Miami a 10-minute drive from the station, and plays racquetball at public courts. &quot;I am a very private, low-key person, but the issue is of such importance that I didn't have any alternative,&quot; he says.    WSVN has been a family business since 1962, the year Mr. Ansin's father obtained the station's license and bought its facilities for $3.4 million. That year, Mr. Ansin came aboard as executive vice president. He went on to become general manager and then was named president when his father died in 1971.    He runs the station from a second-floor office fitted out with plain and functional Danish-modern furniture, most of which dates back to 1962. &quot;It's very good wood,&quot; he says.    Robert W. Leider, WSVN's vice president and general manager, says Mr. Ansin gives his executives a lot of latitude. &quot;He will let you implement your own policies and procedures and then if you have problems, he is there to help you,&quot; says Mr. Leider, who has worked at the station for 13 years.    Mr. Leider recalls that after NBC executives told Mr. Ansin the &quot;traumatic news&quot; of the network's decision, Mr. Ansin replied, &quot;No matter what happens in my life, I still have to have lunch.&quot; He then took the NBC executives to lunch and shared his stone crabs with one of them.    Mr. Ansin plans to pass WSVN on to his three children. He says he won't even consider an often-mentioned third option -- selling the station. &quot;We are not going to sell to CBS,&quot; he says flatly. &quot;I have done this for 25 years. I like television.&quot;    Some analysts think WSVN's challenge will fail and the NBC purchase will go through. Bruce Fein, a Washington-based attorney who once served as general counsel for the FCC, can't recall one case in his two years with the agency that a sale was blocked. And he thinks all the political lobbying may even hurt. &quot;I think (Mr. Ansin's) chances of succeeding are rather remote,&quot; says Mr. Fein.    Mr. Ansin isn't saying what he will do if his FCC challenge fails. But more than one analyst feels Mr. Ansin will continue his battle through the courts. &quot;He has too much at stake not to,&quot; says Mr. Stark, the TV station broker. Oppenheimer's Mr. McAlpine feels that for Mr. Ansin, it is a matter more of principle than economics. &quot;He has been a loyal and trusted affiliate, and so he is asking: Why can't I stay one?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
