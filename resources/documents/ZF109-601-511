Bain, which is based in Boston, maintains branchoffices in London, Paris, San Francisco, Tokyo, Toronto and Munich, Germany.andM;Although the privately held company declines to report its revenues or thenumber of itsemployees, MIS Manager Steven Davis said Bain is among the 20largest consulting companies in the world.andM;&quot;We do strategic consulting for generally very large companies,&quot; Davis said.andO;&quot;Our concentration is in multinational organizations.andP;  Most of our staffworks out of our client companies.andP;  Our work is to help determine products[and] strategies for manufacturing, marketing and customer retention.&quot;andM;Bain's Boston office has a VAX 6310 for accounting and report generation.andO;Ten programmers perform development work on a VAX-11/785.andP;  The company'sinternational field offices maintain their own records on IBM PC ATs andcommunicate with the Boston office over a DECnet-based wide area network.andM;Despite Bain's size and the sophisticated nature of its work, its accountingpractices until recently were in the horse-and-buggy days.andM;Before the company adopted the Coda Integrated Accounting System (IAS) fromCoda of Manchester, N.H., last year,&quot; out of the financial system we producedonly a trial balance,&quot; Davis said.andP;  &quot;For the other reports, we tookinformation from the trial balance and rekeyed it onto Lotus spreadsheets.&quot;andM;Rekeying the data required about 40 clerk/typists.andP;  The Coda system cut thenumber of people required for this task by six.andP;  More importnatly, &quot;theaccuracy of the information is far better because we're getting it from asingle source,&quot; Davis said.andM;The single source is System 1032, a relational database from Compuserve DataTechnologies of Cambridge, Mass.andP;  Also on the VAX 6310, System 1032 feedsdata to the Coda accounting system.andP;  Bain has written two customized programsfor the database.andP;  One covers the worldwide staff's time and expensereporting; the other deals with forecasting staffing requirements.andM;At the end of each month, the field offices report staff time use and expensebilling directly into the Boston database via DECnet, updating the company'svarious client projects.andP;  Reporting is completed by the fourth working day ofthe next month.andM;&quot;On the evening of the fourth working day,&quot; Davis said, &quot;we run a batch jobthat takes this information on time and expense and summarizes it by clientand expense type.andP;  We update the general ledger with this information usingthe IAS Link.&quot;andM;IAS Link is a Coda development tool that helps progrmamers write hooks toconnect a database to Coda's package of three accounting modules--generalledger, accounts receivable and accounts payable.andM;Davis said the hooks were not difficult to develop with IAS Link.andP;  Bain hastwo kinds of data that are pulled from the database for the monthly update ofthe accounting packages.andP;  One is time and expense.andP;  The other tracks suchstatistical data as staff hours by project and a staff head count by officeand department.andP;  A third program pulls data from the accounts payable programand updates records maintained on the database.andM;Writing hooks for each of these data types took about 80 hours of aprogrammer's time, according to Davis.andM;&quot;We consider that very efficient use of a programmer's time,&quot; he said.andM;In addition, the programmers are constantly developing new reports formanagement.andP;  &quot;The [IAS Link] program has become an integral part of theaccounting function here,&quot; Davis said.andP;  &quot;The staff is constantly adding moreand more reports.andP;  Virtually all of our reports are defined by the users, andwe have nearly 200 reports in the system now.&quot;andM;Coda is a software vendor that sells financial software as a package.andP;  Usersbuy the three modules as one package, and the modules operate in unison.andP;  Anupdate in the general ledger is immediately reflected in the accounts payableand accounts receivable modules.andM;A common concern about this kind of integrated software is that suchinstantaneous updating across all the modules eats up too much of a system'sresources.andM;&quot;When I got involved with the Code project at first, that was one of my majorconcerns.andP;  I was worried that the system overhead would be far too heavy[with 30 concurrent users],&quot; Davis said.andM;&quot;But after very extensive testing in which we had people keying ininformation as fast as they could, we didn't get a system degrade,&quot; he added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
