Bill Clinton may have set anew milestone in low-brow scandal. For Enquirer/Star GroupInc., it was business as usual.   And a profitable business it is. The Star, the supermarkettabloid that reportedly paid between $130,000 and $175,000 toa woman who alleges a 12-year romance with Mr. Clinton,regularly pays even higher sums for exclusive stories andphotographs on celebrity secrets. Analysts expectEnquirer/Star Group, which went public last July, to reportnet income of close to $20 million on revenue of $290 millionin its fiscal year ending in March.</LP><TEXT>   Enquirer/Star's revenue comes mainly from its twosupermarket tabloids, the National Enquirer and the Star,which it acquired two years ago from Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp. Though most national advertisers shun the steamytabloids, the Star alone rakes in about $2 million a week inrevenue from newsstand sales, which account for three millionof its total 3.2 million circulation.   The Star keeps about 65 cents for each issue sold; theremaining 30 cents goes to wholesalers and retailers. Lastweek's issue, which contained the story about the allegationsby Gennifer Flowers, a newscaster turned cabaret singer, soldan estimated extra 500,000 copies. A new issue on the standstoday, containing alleged &quot;love tapes&quot; supplied by Ms.Flowers, is also expected to sell an additional 500,000.Total additional revenue from both issues could be as much as$800,000, which one Enquirer/Star executive said &quot;should gostraight to the bottom line.&quot;   The Star is getting as much extra mileage as it can out ofthe exclusive. It sponsored yesterday's news conference withMs. Flowers, where more than 300 news people -- from CNN, thebroadcast networks and most major newspapers -- packed thebriefing.   Media organizations were left to decide how to play theevidence offered by Ms. Flowers, who stood next toposter-sized blow-ups of the Star's front page. The evidenceincluded 300 copies of the audiotape excerpts, as well asaccompanying transcripts, which were handed out to reporters.   Enquirer/Star, based in Lantana, Fla., is controlled byMacfadden Holdings Inc. in partnership with Boston VenturesL.P., which together control 53.6% of its stock. MacFadden,based in New York, is a closely held magazine publisher.   In the year ended March 25, 1991, Enquirer/Star hadoperating profit of $58.5 million on sales of $240.9 million.But interest expense of $55 million resulted in a net loss of$6.2 million.   After paying off some debt, interest costs are expected todecline in fiscal 1992. Enquirer/Star has bank debt of $264million and $132 million in high-interest junk debt,primarily taken on in acquiring the Enquirer from itsoriginal owners and in the subsequent purchase of the Star.   Enquirer/Star has won fans on Wall Street. &quot;We thinkEnquirer/Star has more upside than any media stock we cover,&quot;says Kevin Gruneich, analyst with First Boston Corp. &quot;Theyhave virtually no exposure to the poor advertisingenvironment which has hurt so many other media companies.&quot;   Scandal-mongering helps bankroll Enquirer/Star's newventures, such as a soap opera magazine, expandeddistribution overseas, and the creation of one of the largestmagazine distribution companies in the U.S. Moreover, theStar, which gets less than 15% of its revenue fromadvertising, has been able to sidestep the recession that hasthrottled most big-time publishers.   &quot;The Star and Enquirer have some astronomical swings insales, but week in and week out they are selling an amazingamount at checkouts,&quot; says Dan Capell, a magazine circulationconsultant. &quot;Even without advertising, it makes a lot ofmoney.&quot;   The Star and Enquirer editorial budget is high, $25million a year, an Enquirer/Star executive said. Startingsalaries for reporters are about $60,000 a year, and theEnquirer/Star brand of checkbook journalism is costly. Lastyear, the Star offered a reported $1 million for rights tothe photos and story of the latest Elizabeth Taylor wedding,but was rejected. In 1987, the Enquirer paid $80,000 forphotographs of another presidential hopeful, Gary Hart,aboard the yacht Monkey Business with Donna Rice. &quot;We willpay anything, depending on what a story is worth,&quot; says aStar spokesman.   Both the Enquirer and Star must also pay dearly for theplaces they occupy in supermarkets. Industry experts say eachmagazine pays above the industry average of about $30 percheckout pocket per quarter, which goes directly to thesupermarket chains and stores.   Enquirer/Star stock was offered at $14 a share in July. Asecondary offer of shares owned by News Corp. was made inDecember at $17.50 a share. The shares were quoted yesterdayat $20, up 25 cents, in late New York Stock Exchange trading.</TEXT></DOC>
