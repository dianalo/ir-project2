Tauscher, ComputerLand: Good morning, everybody.andP;  I couldn't helpbut be struck by Jim's slide about adding value with technology.andP;  At the verytop end, there were products or functions that created value 100,000 to200,000 times the cost of goods.andM;If you look at the food chain that we all exist on, we as resellers are atthe very bottom, because we put about 20 cents on top of our cost of goods.andO;It puts us in an interesting position, and I want to talk about the positiona little bit today.andP;  While some may say we don't add value in a technologysense, there is no question that we offer tremendous leverage for the peoplewho do create that technology.andM;Before I talk about the specifies of added value and infrastructures and whatwe do with that technology, I'd like to just take a minute or two to talkabout who we are.andP;  When I came into the industry several years ago with ouracquisition of ComputerLand, I was struck by how poorly understood in thepress and industry trade journals and, frankly, among many of our vendors, weas resellers arc.andM;Part of the reason is that we changed substantially, and part of the reasonis that this has not been a focus given that our business is a bit drab.andO;First and foremost, our business centers on the movement of product; we'reoften referred to as retailers.andP;  In describing who we are, the first thingI'd like to do is strike the word &quot;retail&quot; from your vocabulary.andP;  It is atremendous misnomer and creates tremendous misunderstanding about what wereally do.andP;  We don't sell product at retail anymore; many of the stores weoperate don't even stock product anymore.andP;  Software - business software, byand large, with a few exceptions such as the new user buying one or twocopies - has moved either to mail-order or to some kind of distribution ordirect fulfillment function.andM;Our software sales, for example, have moved to less than 5 percent of ouroverall volume.andP;  We are a reseller or a dealer or a distributor.andP;  Thatdefinition shows a change in how we function and behave.andP;  People talked 20years ago about the number of storefronts they had, about the product theydisplayed, about the way they advertised, and about the number of salespeoplethey had in the stores.andP;  AU of those are typical retail definitions.andP;  Well,the fact is, we have storefronts today because of a historic legacy, notbecause we use them.andP;  We have very few inbound salespeople today.andP;  We've beendoing a detailed study of the amount of business conducted in our stores, andit's less than 5 percent of what we do.andM;For example, ComputerLand has a little more than 2000 salespeople across thecountry; fewer than 200 work in the stores.andP;  AU of these 2000 essentially usethe stores as sales offices.andP;  We've become a business of distributing productto the end-user and of salespeople walking up and down the street calling oncustomers.andM;Fewer, but better?andM;The number of retail stores will drop fairly dramatically in the comingyears.andP;  But, where you will see retail in our business is in its more modernform - large megastores like those in electronics retailing, video retailing,drug store retailing, et cetera.andP;  The corner computer store in the strip mallwill leave us.andP;  It's already happening as I speak, because it has nofunction: Corner stores in strip malls typically exist for convenience, andthat's clearly the business that we are not in.andM;In addition, we've got a cost structure generated by this retail set-up thatmust come out of what we do.andP;  I'm often amused by those operations, includingsome of our own, in financial districts in downtown cities paying $75 and $80a square foot in rent, and many afternoons, you'll find no one but areceptionist sitting in the office - except for a back room where thesalespeople sit hidden.andM;We have become a reseller, a dealer, and we must quit referring to ourselvesas retailers.andM;We're the melting potandM;The second key characteristic is that we're multi-vendor.andP;  A lot of peoplehave asked whether reselling will continue to exist as a function.andP;  My answeris: As long as we remain - as long as there remains a need for multi-vendor,a need will remain for resellers.andP;  The day the industry no longer needsmulti-vendor selling will be the day a reseller's existence is jeopardized.andM;We're multi-vendor for two reasons.andP;  First, our customer is.andP;  He wants to beserviced by someone who handles the basic product lines he's using, and hisinstalled base is multi-vendor.andP;  He very much wants somebody who can moveacross those different product lines he has or may buy.andM;Second, and maybe equally important, is the cost structure.andP;  Today, we arerunning organizations whose selling function costs slightly less than 4percent of sales, and we couldn't approach that number if we weresingle-vendor.andP;  We are running overall organizations whose payroll is lessthan 10 percent and whose entire SGandamp;A is less than 15 percent to move thatproduct.andM;In fact, product that used to be sold through our organizations at 30 and 35percent is sold today at less than 20 percent in the major cities, with abouta 5 to 6 percentage point differential in the smaller cities.andP;  We have in asense become a very efficient distribution machine with outbound salespeopledriving it.andM;The challengesandM;How do we stay multi-vendor but with a fairly narrow product line? Each lineneeds support and services and infrastructure, and the costs are tieddirectly to the breadth of that fine.andM;Second, how do we continue to lower our costs by the application of varioussystem technologies? Besides simply selling product with tons of outboundsalespeople, we're a third-party service business.andM;Although it was largely ignored for years in the pc business, several of themore sophisticated chains began to discover that service was a key to thebusiness - as so many dealers in other industries have discovered.andP;  This is avery different business from the product-distribution business.andP;  The businesswas 70 percent margins, 45 to 50 percent SGandamp;A and 20 to 25 percent pretaxmargins.andM;Obviously the proportion of service business we do, compared with a productbusiness that operates on I and 2 percent pretax, has enormous leverage onprofitability, and on our ability to be competitive with the product itself.andO;We have enormous energy in our piece of the food chain-in trying to organizethis business with systems, with management, as a separate function.andP;  What'smost interesting to me is that it's not a question of stealing market sharefrom each other or from the manufacturer.andP;  Rather, in many cases we have anunorganized service function.andP;  Customers simply don't get service untilsomething breaks and they don't know what to do.andM;Without service becoming a highly organized function, moving pcs into themost critical applications is simply impossible.andP;  We are investing heavily inthis today.andP;  It's about 7 percent of our business; it needs to double.andO;Around the world, there are resellers who have got it up to as much as 20percent of the business and as much as two-thirds of the profit.andP;  To a largedegree, our success and our continued existence is based on our ability to bea world-class service and hardware-maintenance organization.andM;NetworksandM;The second service could be called a lot of things: I use the word networkingfor a specific reason.andP;  Fundamentally, it's a systems engineering orconsulting service.andP;  At ComputerLand now, there are about 400 systemsengineers, and as near as I can count, around 2000 to 2500 in the entireindustry.andP;  They focus almost exclusively on networking.andM;With some exceptions, resellers are not equipped for or focused on UNIX;they're not equipped for or focused on vertical applications; they certainlyare selling traditional office productivity, including desktop publishing andmedia applications.andP;  But the new infrastructure being set up and probably thesingle biggest place we are adding resources is systems engineers fornetworking and connectivity.andM;The key question is: In a world with less than 20 percent margin, who paysfor that resource tied to a consulting business?andM;To someone who works with the pre-sale and the post-sale installationprocess, it is clearly a training and education function.andP;  As near as we canteff, there are something close to 1500 classrooms at resellers across thecountry.andP;  This business also has not been well-organized.andP;  It's been anafterthought, sometimes given away.andP;  It's not separated out and structurallyclear as a profit center, but it's clearly a necessity as we move into aworld of more and more complexity.andP;  It is a business much easier to chargefor and to get the customers to pay for, as opposed to the networking,systems-engineering and consulting business.andM;As technology is speeding up, the short-term rental business is meetingincreasing demand in large organizations, even more so than in small ones.andO;Today we have about 350 centers in this business, and as near as we cancount, almost 1800 across the United States.andP;  This business will go well over81 billion during the next couple of years.andP;  Of course, it's as much afinancial function as a selling or marketing or added-value function.andO;Overhead on our shouldersandM;One of the key areas a reseller has to attack is corporate overhead.andP;  To alarge degree our cost-effectiveness depends on how we function at corporateheadquarters.andP;  Whether we're a franchiser who's operating a pseudo-corporateheadquarters or a chain operation, there's tremendous potential leverage notonly for analysis of product but also for development of systems, all of thefinance, all of the large-account sales functions and, of course, all of thepeople.andP;  For a long time, we were an industry organized in such a fashionthat the corporate function didn't exist.andP;  We were really a collection or agroup of independents, including ComputerLand, of course, which began theindustry.andM;If you look at the different models of the reseller industry, it's anindustry that's changing but along a traditional path.andP;  Ten years ago, theso-called independents really made up the world of resellers or dealers.andM;Even for ComputerLand (which, while many people had the same name, didn'toperate as a chain), the end result was no leverage from economies of scaleor corporate costs.andP;  ComputerLand was a high-cost operator.andP;  It was verydifficult for suppliers of any kind to deal with resellers, because in manycases it was necessary to deal with them one-off, and it was a fundamentallydisorganized industry.andP;  But if you trace back any retail business, anywholesale distribution function, they've all begun that way.andM;The fact is, independents will be gone within the next five years.andP;  They aredisappearing by the day, by the hundreds.andP;  The only independents we reallysee remaining are those in small towns that have specialized in certainmanufacturers' lines or certain niche markets.andM;The rest are going in a couple of directions.andM;One of those directions is the wholesale direction.andP;  The traditional functionyou see in other industries has happened here - the wholesale function.andP;  Thebest examples of wholesalers I know are Intelligent Electronics and evenMicroAge, which began as a franchise chain.andP;  Obviously, a wholesaler is firstand foremost distributing products and collecting interest on buying anddistribution advantages, benefiting from economies of scale.andM;Almost aU of the independents that have not or win not be acquired by one ofthe chains - that we'll talk about in a minute - have now affiliatedthemselves with one of these wholesale distribution operations.andP;  In manycases they are getting service as well as distribution functions.andM;Obviously, that has some clear implications for how manufacturers, suppliersand software publishers deal with our industry.andP;  They will be less and lessable to deal with the independent dealer as the industry organizes itself.andM;The second direction involves the natural evolution of chains: Independentscan't function against a chain operation if it's well-run, because theycannot operate at the same level of cost-effectiveness a corporation can.andM;Over the last three or four years, the Businesslands and the ComputerFactories and others clearly proved that, as they lowered operational costs,and the rising competitiveness in margins resulted.andM;The ComputerLand storyandM;The ComputerLand model is a little different.andP;  Years ago, ComputerLandclearly was a collection of independents, We've been working diligently tomake it a chain of independents, and yet try to realize the economies ofscale of a corporation.andP;  To that end, we've been moving toward singleoperators in a market, a much lower number of owners and a much differentformulation of the arrangements between us, all the while trying to leveragethose economies of scale across the board.andP;  If you take a look at what thatall says about resellers, it says we gained dramatic share over the last fouror five years.andP;  We did it because we could provide faster delivery; basicproduct-distribution was something we did very well.andP;  We had, to ouradvantage, the economics of a multi-vendor and we offered the function ofmulti-vendor integration.andP;  We became the most efficient channel or certainlya more efficient channel, and the percentage of business that went through usincreased.andM;Then some bad things began to happen.andP;  lake most immature retail/distributionindustries, we were burdened with overdistribution.andP;  This of course wascreated by manufacturer policies, which simply led to too many people chasingthe same commodity-priced products and attempting to compete on the smallvalue-added of distribution - competing with so many other dealers out there.andM;Our industry of resellers had high growth, moving along at 30 and 40 percent.andO;While that growth is slowing and we're in a maturing environment, it still isdouble-digit across the board.andP;  Even with some of the latest reports ofslowdown, I expect a 15 to 20 percent growth out of resellers next year.andM;Complex systemsandM;But probably the biggest problem besides the issues of managing growth, ofcommodity pricing and of margins slipping with over-distribution, is greaterproduct complexity.andP;  This has caused failure in the channel.andM;For a long time, except for individual instances, failure in the channel orfailure among resellers was just unimagined.andP;  I don't think we've seen theend of it.andP;  I believe we'll see several other major failures before the dayis done, because of the tremendous drive to cut costs.andM;For example, two years ago, even very few ComputerLand stores had automatedtheir businesses.andP;  Our distribution was not automated.andP;  Since then, we andothers have spent considerable money on basic automation to lower our cost ofproduct flow and cost of information flow.andM;Clearly, resources have been reassigned as buyouts and mergers have occurred.andO;Even some of those collections of independents I spoke about were createddramatically under the pressures I described earlier.andM;Some simple questionsandM;Now, a couple of simple questions.andP;  Do we have a customer who really wantsservice? Given his preoccupation with price, it's a question that definitelyneeds to he asked.andP;  We spend time on original customer research and theanswer comes back two-fold.andP;  First, we have dissatisfied customers.andP;  Withoutquestion, customers do not rate resellers/dealers as a source of satisfactionwhen it comes to the basic service.andM;And second, the larger the organization, the more it demands service andranks it as important.andP;  For a while, the reseller was a source of thatservice, and it grew dramatically as a proportion of the overall product hehandled.andM;This slide shows that through  88 and  89 revenues increase over 80 percent.andO;But at the same time, if you looked at the growth curves of the differententities, you grew faster the cheaper you sold the product.andM;Simply said, the lower the margin on product distribution, the faster thegrowth - a phenomenon that has continued for the last year or two.andM;The second question: In a period where we're not sure the customer wantsservice, and the margins are declining like mad, how is the channel going todeal with the complexity of groupware and other products that will be talkedabout over the next two days?andM;There's no question about the complexity.andP;  In terms of operating systems, westarted out in a simple world.andP;  While there are great differences inpredictions about how the pie chart will be cut, the facts are it's simplynot going to be the same world it was back in  87.andM;And if it isn't difficult enough hooking computers together and sharing data,we are moving past that world into one of different hierarchies,client/server models and networks.andM;We've done that in the face of a clear decline in margins.andP;  If I had the mostrecent data, we'd see another drop of several points.andP;  The margins for thebusiness overall have settled into the low 20s.andP;  If you remove themaintenance and service business and consulting, our product margins have byand large gone into the mid-to-high teens.andP;  Frankly, even with all the volumeand all the multi-vendor efficiencies, it does not leave us in a position toafford the resources necessary to handle the complexities.andM;Incredibly stupid?andM;How do we get out of this dilemma as an entity? And how do the vendors andthe suppliers get out of the dilemma without going to a much higher coststructure and trying to do it all themselves? I often hear complaints fromvarious hardware manufacturers or software people that resellers seem to beincredibly stupid in the way they price product.andP;  They don't seem tounderstand how to do anything but slash each other's throat.andM;Part of that is a function of the way the industry is maturing and settlingin.andP;  But it is also a function of customers who have not yet been taught orwill not yet recognize the cost of the support services required by newarchitectures and new products.andM;Now, who will pay for it? In the end it win be the customer; it always isbecause it translates into a higher SGandamp;A cost.andP;  The customers will pay thatdifference.andP;  To a degree, we win be able to build some of that into our ownbusiness and stabilize margins.andM;I believe, however, the solution really lies in this simple question: Whowill pay for it?andP;  Over the last year we've seen enormous movement towards it.andO;As resellers, we first and foremost have to decide what we're going to sellwithin a certain product bandwidth, or we can't manage the problem.andM;But once we make that decision, we and our vendor partners in that bandwidthhave to reformulate our relationships.andP;  We can no longer besupplier/customer; we can no longer be people who negotiate at arm's length.andO;Fundamentally, we have to become partners, and the vendors have to take anattitude that says: This is my sales and service organization.andP;  nat would Ilike it to have - from a support and service function, an SE or consultingfunction - to handle this new technology?&quot;andM;This is done as almost a joint budgeting exercise.andP;  Today we are sitting downwith our actual budgeting process, laying out people requirements and layingout their costs, and the vendors are stepping up and paying for them.andP;  Butit's not in added margin; it is in something called soft dollars or&quot;non-invoice gross margin.&quot;andM;Frankly, it doesn't matter anymore whether we have a 40 or 50 or 60 percentmargin, because almost all our pricing is in effect cost-plus.andM;The vendors will payandM;To a degree, we are unbundling this service function of providing systemsengineering consulting and adding to it.andP;  But we also are accelerating thecreation of an infrastructure and all the training that goes with it byforming new relationships with our vendors where they directly reimbursecosts.andM;Now the danger in this - because it's been worked on now for about two yearsand sometimes has come off misguided is that the manufacturer doesn'tsufficiently form the partnership, but simply provides the dollars in looseand, shall we say, unsupervised ways.andP;  In that case, the dollars becomestreet margin, and they don't accomplish the purpose the customer needs andthe manufacturer wants.andM;I'll give you an interesting number.andP;  Three years ago our SGandamp;A inComputerLand overall ran about $50 minion.andP;  The amount of dollars that we gotfor market development ran about $8 million.andP;  This year, ComputerLand's SGandamp;Ais about the same for this corporate headquarters function, excluding thestores' SGandamp;A, but the dollars that we win be spending for market developmentand technical infrastructure support, excluding dollars going directly to ourstores, are now in excess of  40 million.andM;The point is that the dollars have already started to flow.andP;  Now the burdenis to form the partnerships so that they are correctly spent on the supportfunction that's become necessary and recognized.andM;Why they'll payandM;Quick summary: We clearly have a world of increasing complexity.andP;  We needmore support and more training.andP;  We clearly have a world with an dissatisfiedcustomer, and again the answer and the solution are the same.andM;To provide it we've got to increase our margins.andP;  Part of that we'll do onour own; a big part of that is happening simply with the shift in the way ourvendors and our manufacturers are doing business with us.andP;  The dollars thatthey're investing in us are different from simple margin dollars.andP;  Thank youall very much.andM;[Applause]</TEXT></DOC>
