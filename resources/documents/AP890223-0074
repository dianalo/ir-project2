(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Investigators probing the explosion of PanAm Flight 103 have eliminated all but 25 to 30 names from the listof passengers with baggage that could have contained the bomb, anewspaper reported today.   The Syracuse Post Standard reported that a U.S. official, whichit didn't identify, made the disclosure but did not name thepassengers.   About 49 of the 259 passengers and crew members aboard the Boeing747 that crashed into the Scottish town of Lockerbie Dec. 21 boardedin Frankfurt, West Germany, where Flight 103 originated. All aboardthe plane were killed, as well as 11 people on the ground.   Scottish police last week released a photograph of the bag thatcontained the bomb, believed to have been hidden in a radio cassetteplayer. Authorities said the baggage likely originated in Frankfurt.   Most of the luggage from Germany had been placed in an aluminumbaggage container that was loaded into the front cargo hold on theleft side of the aircraft.   Investigators know which container carried the bomb but have notpinpointed the suitcase. The containers hold between 40 and 50 bags.   The newspaper's source said Scottish authorities, who are beingassisted by U.S. and German experts, have reduced the list furtherthrough background checks and other efforts.   In Lockerbie, Police Inspector John McLean would not comment onthe investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
