<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-1284 </DOCNO><TEXT>A high-T/sub c/ Y-Ba-Cu-O superconductor coating has been prepared usingplasma spray technique with the critical temperature onset at 101 K andzero resistance at 86 K. The results of resistance and susceptibilitymeasurements show that the coating sample has the similar superconductingproperties comparing with that of the bulk superconductor. X-ray diffractionand EPM analysis indicate that the coating consists of YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub3}O/sub 9-//sub x/ single phase compound and some trace phases.</TEXT></DOC>
