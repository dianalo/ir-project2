(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has proposederecting some of the nation's toughest barriers to hostiletakeovers in an effort to protect the Massachusetts miracle fromcorporate raiders.   The former Democratic presidential candidate said Tuesday thebarriers would include mandatory severance pay for workers laid offduring takeover battles and a higher percentage of share ownershiprequired for control.   Dukakis said he hoped the package would inspire similar measuresacross the nation. He had called for anti-takeover action duringlast year's presidential campaign.   ``In the absence of federal action ... the states have got tomove _ and we're going to move,'' he said.   The governor outlined the legislation in Cambridge's TechnologySquare, outside the headquarters of Polaroid Corp., which recentlystaved off a $3.1 billion hostile bid from Shamrock Holdings Inc.of Burbank, Calif.   Dukakis said Polaroid's experience helped shape the bill.   The instant photography company, which is incorporated inDelaware, made use of a Delaware law that bars completion of atakeover for three years unless the raider either gets approval ofthe target company or buys 85 percent of its stock.   By placing millions of its shares in friendly hands through anemployee stock ownership plan, Polaroid made it virtuallyimpossible for Shamrock to reach the 85 percent level.   The Massachusetts law would go further, raising the threshold to90 percent. The law would also be triggered earlier _ delaying atakeover as soon as a hostile bidder acquires 5 percent of a publiccompany's stock, rather than 15 percent, as in Delaware.   The bill was drafted by a 27-member commission appointed byDukakis and including labor leaders, corporate executives, lawyersand legislators.   Some provisions, such as the severance pay, are expected to drawopposition from business lobbyists. Merger specialists alsopredicted that the 5 percent threshold would be challenged in courtas an unconstitutional intrusion on federal authority overinterstate commerce.   ``It's an admirable effort, but the question is going to comedown to state regulation versus federal regulation, and I thinkthere's going to be a lot of debate about it,'' said Thomas J.Dougherty, a partner in the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate,Meagher andamp; Flom. ``They're going to be in and out of court.''   Dukakis maintained the legislation was not designed to ban alltakeovers, or even all hostile takeovers.   Rather, he said, ``the aim is to force takeover artists to besocially responsible'' and block them from buying companies, layingoff workers and then selling the companies piecemeal at big profits.   Among the legislation's provisions is a requirement that anacquiring company assume all of the takeover target's laborcontracts.   In addition, boards of directors would be given explicitpermission to consider the interests of employees, customers andcommunities in deciding whether to reject a takeover offer. Thatwould help insulate directors from lawsuits by shareholders whofavor selling out quickly for the highest price.   From the time a raider acquires 5 percent of a company's stockuntil two years after the takeover is completed, all employees whoare laid off without good cause would be entitled to two weeksseverance pay for each year they had been employed.   Also, the legislation would make it easier for corporations toset up shareholder rights plans, or ``poison pill'' defenses, whichboost the price of a takeover by giving shareholders an automaticright to buy additional shares.   Proponents of the takeovers that have reshaped corporate Americain the 1980s contend that hostile bids have shaken up entrenchedmanagers and forced companies to pay more attention to providing agood return to stockholders.   But Dukakis said in Massachusetts the most common takeovertargets are not weak companies, but well-run firms whose stock isundervalued because executives focus on long-term opportunities notquarterly profits.   ``It's our best corporate citizens that are being attacked _it's the Polaroids, the Primes, the Gillettes, the Stop 'n'Shops,'' he said, referring to a string of Massachusetts companiesthat have faced takeover battles in recent years.</TEXT></DOC>
