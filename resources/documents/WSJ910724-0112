Andnow some other fund groups are starting to follow suit.Fidelity Investments of Boston has launched its Spartanfunds, which use their low expenses as a major selling point.In recent years, New York's Dreyfus Corp. has temporarilyheld down expenses on some of its bond and money market fundsin a major push to attract new investors.   Why all the fuss about expenses? There are two componentsto a mutual fund's performance: How the fund's portfolioperforms, and what it costs to get that performance.   Predicting which mutual funds will perform well isnotoriously difficult. But it's easy to find out about afund's annual expenses. This nugget of information appearsnear the front of every mutual fund prospectus, the officialsales document that a fund must send to new investors.   If you buy a fund with low annual expenses, you won'tnecessarily get good performance. But you will start out withan advantage over anybody who buys a similar fund charginghigher expenses.   Mutual fund expenses are stated as a percentage of afund's average assets in any one year. On average,diversified stock funds charge 1.46% of assets annually,while taxable bond funds levy 1.07% and taxable money funds0.69%. Lumped into these percentages are such expenses as thefee paid to the fund's investment adviser and the cost ofservicing shareholder accounts.   Over the past 10 years, lower-cost stock and bond fundshave tended to perform better than their higher-costcompetitors, according to calculations by Morningstar Inc., aChicago mutual fund research firm. Among taxable bond funds,the thriftiest one-third in terms of expenses returned 12.7%a year for the decade, compared with 12% a year for thosewhose costs were among the highest one-third. Similarly, theleanest stock funds gained 13.8% a year, vs. 10.8% for themost costly funds.   Does this mean a fund's expenses should always be a keyconsideration when selecting a fund? It all depends on whatsort of fund you are buying, says Kenneth Gregory, editor ofL/G No-Load Fund Analyst, a San Francisco newsletter.   With stock funds, returns can vary so widely that pickinga lousy fund is likely to be a disaster no matter how thriftythe fund is. Over the past 12 months, for instance, thebest-performing small-company stock fund soared 37%, whilethe poorest fund was pounded for a 12.2% loss, according toLipper Analytical Services. For those in the worst-performingfund, a skimpy expense ratio would have been scant comfort.   As a result, fund analysts suggest that although it issmart to avoid funds that have outlandish expenses, investorsshouldn't select a stock fund just because it has low annualcosts. &quot;My rule of thumb is that I won't look at any {stock}fund that's over 1.5%,&quot; says Mr. Gregory.   But when it comes to money market funds and most bondfunds, the differences in fund returns are usually so slightthat most investors would be well-advised to stick with thelowest-cost funds, argues Mr. Gregory. The one exception:High-yielding junk bond funds, where the track record of thefund manager is probably the most important factor inselecting a fund, analysts say.   Money funds seek to maintain a stable $1 share price, andthey do so by buying government and top-quality corporatedebt that only has a couple of months until it matures.Because money funds are so tightly constrained in what theycan do, there's little variation in money fund returns, andmuch of the variation that does exist can be explained bydifferences in fund expenses. Over the past 12 months, thetop-performing taxable money fund gained 7.9%, while thelowest-ranked fund was up 5.2%, a spread of just 2.7percentage points.   Money fund yields have come down sharply this year, to5.62% today from 7.65% six months ago, according toIBC/Donoghue. That means investors have even more reason tostick with low-cost funds, because expenses now are taking aneven bigger share of the dividends that a fund earns. A fundthat is making 10% before expenses will see its return toshareholders cut by a tenth if it has a 1% expense ratio. Butif interest rates drop so that a fund is earning only 5%before expenses, a 1% expense ratio slashes the return toshareholders by 20%.   For people given to bargain hunting, there are some moneyfunds that charge expenses well below the 0.69% average.According to IBC/Donoghue, the lowest-cost taxable moneyfunds open to small investors are Vanguard's three taxablemoney funds, which each charge 0.3% annually. But some otherfunds are temporarily absorbing expenses, so that they cannow boast costs that are even skimpier than Vanguard's.Dreyfus 100% U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund L.P., forinstance, is currently charging 0.13%, while Fidelity SpartanTreasury Money Market Fund is levying just 0.15%.   Unlike money funds, bond funds can see their share pricefluctuate because they hold longer-term debt whose valueswings in response to interest-rate changes and the outlookfor inflation and corporate credit quality. Because of theseshareprice fluctuations, there can be sharp differencesbetween a bond fund's yield and its total return. Totalreturn is the true return earned by shareholders, and itincludes not only a fund's dividend yield, but also anyshare-price change.   Because bond fund shares seesaw, returns usually vary morethan they do with money funds. But bond funds of the samevariety still tend to produce returns that are fairlysimiliar. Over the past year, for instance, the leadingGovernment National Mortgage Association bond fund gained12.3%, only 4.1 percentage points better than the poorestperforming &quot;Ginnie Mae&quot; fund, which returned 8.2%.   Mr. Gregory says investors would be foolish to buy a bondfund with an expense ratio above 0.8%. But he sees littlereason to pay even that much. &quot;For bond funds, I viewVanguard as the standard,&quot; he says. &quot;If you go to Vanguard,you don't have to pay more than 0.4%.&quot; Those low expenses,argues Mr. Gregory, gives Vanguard's bond funds a heftyadvantage over most of their competitors.</TEXT></DOC>
