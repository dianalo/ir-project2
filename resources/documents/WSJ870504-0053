Banks raised their prime lending rates to 8% from 7 3/4% Friday. That was the second rise in about a month, and was initiated by Citibank.    The move came only a day after the Federal Reserve confirmed speculation that it recently had tightened credit conditions slightly. Fed officials hope that their small action, coupled with Japan's promise to reduce its interest rates, will mean they won't have to administer stronger medicine. But a stiffer dose may soon be needed anyway, several economists contend.    &quot;I believe the Fed will have no choice but to raise its discount rate&quot; half a percentage point to 6% within a few weeks, said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. He predicted that will trigger yet another increase in the prime rate to 8 1/4% or possibly even 8 1/2%.    Mr. Sinai contended that the higher rates are likely because the joint moves by the Fed and Japan &quot;will not be enough to stem the decline of the dollar.&quot; The Fed, he said, will need to take this stronger action to &quot;stop inflation from getting out of hand.&quot;    In Washington, the White House sent mixed signals over the rise in the prime rate. Asked during a ceremony Friday about the banks' action, President Reagan told reporters: &quot;I wish they hadn't&quot; done it.    But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater clarified the White House position later, saying, &quot;We hope that this increase in rates, which should be helpful in preserving the dramatic gains that we have made against inflation, will be temporary in nature.&quot;    The previous increase in the prime rate, to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2%, was the first since mid-1984 and also was led by Citibank. The prime rate is used by banks as a base rate on a wide range of loans to medium-size and small businesses as well as to individuals. But the nation's biggest corporations pay little attention to it because they can borrow at rates well below the prime.    Bond prices soared Thursday after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker confirmed the Fed tightening. Prices surged further after Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said he has ordered Japan's Finance Ministry and central bank to cut short-term interest rates.    But bond prices fell sharply Friday, erasing much of Thursday's gains, while most short-term interest rates surged. &quot;The bond market is saying loud and clear that what Volcker and Nakasone have done is not enough,&quot; Mr. Sinai said.    The double-barreled Fed-Japanese action faces an even tougher test this week when the Treasury sells $29 billion of notes and bonds in its quarterly financing operation.    The Treasury financing will begin tomorrow with the sale of $10 billion of three-year notes, followed by $9.75 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday and $9.25 billion of 30-year bonds Thursday. The big question facing the credit markets is how much Japanese investors, who have been hurt badly by the dollar's sharp drop against the yen, will buy. Without large purchases by Japanese institutions, interest rates will have to rise, many economists and bond traders say.    The Fed has gone &quot;only part way toward satisfying the markets' needs for support of the dollar,&quot; said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. He contended that the odds of a discount rate increase of at least half a percentage point are &quot;pretty good.&quot;    Fed officials haven't disclosed how much tightening they have done so far, nor has Japan specified which interest rates it would lower, by how much, or even when it will do so. Mr. Volcker merely referred to the Fed's recent maneuver as &quot;snugging.&quot;    Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., agrees that last week's moves by the Fed and Japan shouldn't be considered the solution to the credit markets' troubles. In a report, &quot;Snugging Is Not the End of the Story,&quot; Mr. Kaufman predicted: &quot;Any further significant weakness in the dollar will be met by additional tightening of U.S. monetary policy.&quot;    But some analysts insist that the economy is too weak to withstand another round of higher interest rates, and thus that the Fed probably won't tighten credit conditions any further.    The economy &quot;already is not very strong and would be jeopardized by a rate increase,&quot; said Francis H. Schott, chief economist at Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. &quot;That risk is enough to give you sleepless nights.&quot;    More clues to the economic outlook will emerge Friday when the Labor Department releases its April employment report. Many analysts expect the data to indicate the economy remains sluggish.    According to the median estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Money Market Services Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., the number of workers on nonfarm payrolls rose 225,000 last month. That would compare with a gain of 164,000 reported for March. Individual estimates range from 180,000 to 350,000. However, the median estimate also shows no change in the civilian unemployment rate, which stood at 6.6% in March.    Maury N. Harris, first vice president and chief economist of PaineWebber Inc., expects an improvement in the U.S. balance of trade in coming months. That, he said, &quot;should lend support to the dollar, which in turn means the Fed won't have to keep increasing interest rates to stabilize the dollar.&quot; But he added, &quot;I would be the first to admit this is a very close call because it is very difficult to forecast the trade balance.&quot;    Mr. Harris said the latest prime rate increase was &quot;a foregone conclusion&quot; because of recent increases in banks' own borrowing costs. Many other analysts agreed, saying they had expected a higher prime rate much sooner.    That reaction is markedly different from about a month ago, when Citibank's prime rate boost caught many analysts by surprise and jolted the credit markets. At that time, several analysts contended that the real reason banks raised their rates was to fatten their profit margins and to offset losses on loans to debt-ridden nations such as Brazil.    Banks, such as Citibank, insisted that was unfair. But analysts say the negative publicity that Citibank and other banks received probably led them to wait longer than they otherwise would have before raising the prime rate again.    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Interest rates surged and bond prices fell sharply in an abrupt reversal of the euphoria that swept the credit markets Thursday. Some actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds fell about 1 1/2 points, or $15 for each $1,000 face amount. That followed Thursday's gains of about 2 1/2 points, which was the biggest rally since early last June.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell to 88 15/32 from 90 1/32 Thursday. The yield rose to 8.58% from 8.42%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 declined to 92 26/32 from 93 29/32 as the yield rose to 8.36% from 8.18%.    In when-issued trading, the new three-year Treasury notes to be auctioned tomorrow were quoted late Friday at 7.73%. The 10-year notes were quoted at 8.36% and the 30-year bonds were quoted at 8.52%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 12.39 points to close at 1300.03. It ranged between 1296.94 and 1309.29.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bill rate surged to 5.6% bid from 5.39% Thursday. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills rose to 5.97% bid from 5.86%. </TEXT></DOC>
