The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA _ hasproduced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemiapatients treated, and none has relapsed so far.   Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it``may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cellleukemia.''   The drug also has been used successfully against chroniclymphocytic leukemia. It, like hairy cell leukemia, is a cancer ofthe white blood cells, which produce disease-fighting antibodies.   The latest study, published in Thursday's New England Journal ofMedicine, was directed by Dr. Lawrence D. Piro of the ScrippsClinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif. Scripps recentlymade an agreement with Johnson andamp; Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceuticals toproduce and distribute the drug once it's approved by the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration.   In the published work, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients asfar back as four years ago. In 11, the disease disappeared and theyremain disease free.   In all, the Scripps doctors have treated 24 patients with almostcomplete success. However, they caution that longer follow up willbe necessary before they can be sure they have actually cured thedisease.   Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developedin recent years. They are interferon and deoxycoformycin, a drugthat is similar to 2-CdA. However, interferon is less effective,and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.   By contrast, the only unwanted effect of 2-CdA was a few days offever. Patients experienced no nausea, hair loss, rashes or othersymptoms typical of cancer therapy. Also unlike other treatments,this one appears to work after a single seven-day course of therapy.</TEXT></DOC>
