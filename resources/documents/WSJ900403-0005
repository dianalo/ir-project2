The new mini, which had been expected, comes in a seriescalled the ATandamp;T System 7000 and is being marketed tocompanies with heavy transaction processing needs such ashotels, financial-services companies and phone companies. Itis also the product of a yearlong collaboration between theAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. unit and PyramidTechnology Corp., Mountain View, Calif., which designed andbuilds the machine.</LP><TEXT>   The 7000 is ATandamp;T's first minicomputer product employingreduced-instruction-set-computing (RISC) architecture. RISCdesigns offer faster computing since the computer needs fewerinternal instructions to perform tasks. The computer alsouses the Unix software operating system designed by ATandamp;T BellLaboratories and is said to handle 170 transactions persecond and up to 122 million instructions per second.   James E. Clark, ATandamp;T product management and developmentvice president for minicomputers and high performancesystems, said the new line expands the performance of ATandamp;T'sproducts beyond its current top-of-the-line 3B minicomputers.This, he added, should make ATandamp;T competitive with low-endmainframe computers made by International Business MachinesCorp. and Amdahl Corp. and RISC-based systems that ATandamp;Texpects its competitors such as Digital Equipment Corp. tobring out in 1991.   Pricing for the new computer ranges from $88,000 for asystem, including software, that handles 128 computer users,to $225,000 for a system tying together 1,000 users.</TEXT></DOC>
