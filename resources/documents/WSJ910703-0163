The 31-member panel, headed by William Brock, a formerlabor secretary, concluded that teachers must go beyondtraditional instruction methods in reading, writing andarithmetic to convince high school students that classroomwork is relevant.</LP><TEXT>   Many students don't work hard &quot;because they do not believethe lessons they are learning are connected to the real worldor that the diplomas they are earning will bring them abrighter future,&quot; said a message from Labor Secretary LynnMartin and commission members. The panel said its conclusionswill be taken to parents, educators and employers.   Mr. Brock, who for six years has been on a personalmission to help revamp education and worker capabilities forjob challenges of the future, said the report is aimed at the50% of high school graduates who don't go to college and the70% who don't complete college.   Mr. Brock and the Labor Department billed the report as&quot;the first concrete stage&quot; of President Bush's &quot;America 2000&quot;education strategy. But the commission was launched a yearago by then Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, well ahead of therecent announcement of the new strategy by Mr. Bush and LamarAlexander, his new Education Secretary.   Starting a week from now, the Labor Department begins its&quot;outreach effort&quot; with meetings in its 10 regional offices,bringing in educators, employers, workers and parents, Mrs.Martin said. Officials will try to spread the message of thepanel, formally called the Secretary's Commission onAchieving Necessary Skills, or SCANS.   Employers today put a premium on reasoning skills and anability and willingness to learn, a conclusion the panelreached by asking workers what they use on the job andemployers what they need, Mrs. Martin said.   This realization has been spurred by competitivechallenges, Mr. Brock said. &quot;We didn't know this 10 yearsago,&quot; he said. If more sophisticated teaching of such skillsisn't adopted, young workers &quot;will be condemned to a dead-endjob,&quot; he said.   The commission found that over half of young Americansleave school without skills needed for meaningful employment.It recommended that employers convey to educators and thatschools adopt teaching emphasizing five &quot;competencies&quot;:   -- Managing resources of time, money, space and staff.   -- Acquiring and evaluating data, organizing and keepingfiles, interpreting and communicating information and usingcomputers.   -- Working on teams, teaching others, serving customers,leading and working with people from culturally differentbackgrounds -- all &quot;interpersonal abilities.&quot;   -- Understanding social, organizational and other systems;monitoring and correcting the systems' performance anddesigning or improving them.   -- Selecting technology equipment, applying technology tospecific tasks and troubleshooting technologies.   In addition, the report urged that teachers impart&quot;foundation&quot; skills -- reading, writing and mathematics, aswell as listening and speaking; thinking skills, such asproblem solving and decision making; and personal qualities,such as individual responsibility and self-management.   The report builds on a year-earlier report by theCommission of the Skills of the American Workplace, which washeaded by Mr. Brock and Ray Marshall, another former laborsecretary. That report urged major changes in education andworkplace organization to emphasize higher skills and greaterworker authority over how jobs are done.   The new report was applauded by groups including theNational Alliance of Business, the Association of IndependentColleges and Schools, and the National Association of Tradeand Technical Schools.   An early application of the SCANS report will occur thissummer in Indiana, where 100 high school juniors will askworkers in five cities what skills they use in their jobs.The students will then report to their schools andcommunities, and any gaps disclosed will be used to revampschool curriculums to reflect the new skills, said H. DeanEvans, state superintendent of education.   As of now, &quot;We don't understand the relevance&quot; of what istaught, for &quot;the real world,&quot; Mr. Evans said.</TEXT></DOC>
