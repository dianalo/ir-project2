The use of nitrate is already prohibitedin pumped bacon. This proposed rule would also withdraw the previous proposal,published June 7, 1980 (45 FR 43425), on the same subject and correct twotypographical errors in andSection; 318.7(c)(4) concerning the quantitationof nitrite in cured products.A recent innovation in bacon manufacturing has been the introduction ofmassaged bacon.

It will not result in an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies, orgeographical regions; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities</ITAG>The Administrator also has determined that this proposed rule will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354 (5 U.S.C.601). There are approximately 200 establishments now producing either drycured, immersion cured or massaged bacon products. All of these establishmentswould be subject to this proposed rule. Of these 200 establishments, 5produce either massaged or immersion cured bacon and the remaining 195produce dry cured bacon. The majority of these 200 establishments can beconsidered as small entities, because they produce a low volume of baconproducts per establishment. Preliminary information from an AgriculturalResearch Service survey begun in mid-1986 and not yet completed indicatesthat the majority of establishments which produce dry cured bacon no longeruse nitrate in their cure. Thus, the majority of affected establishmentsare now operating in compliance with the proposed requirements on use ofnitrate. The few establishments which are still using nitrate as part oftheir curing process would be required to eliminate its use but could substitutenitrite to achieve the same technical effect. There is no significant costdifference between the purchase of nitrate or nitrite. Limiting the amountof nitrite that may be used in the product is expected to have a positiveaffect on producers as they will be able to use less nitrite and thus saveon the cost of purchasing nitrite.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning thisproposed rule. Written comments should be sent to the Policy Office andshould refer to the docket number that appears in the heading of this document.All comments submitted in response to this action will be made availablefor public inspection in the Policy Office between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.,Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The use of nitrate in the curing of meat can be traced back several hundredyears. In the early 1900's, chemists and meat scientists began to understandsome of the mechanisms of the nitrate curing process. Nitrate's principalrole is as a source of nitrite which fixes the characteristic pink colorin cured meat products. In recognition of this color fixing role playedby nitrite \1\<NOTE/> in the curing process, the Department approved its directuse to reduce dependence on the unreliable conversion of nitrate to nitrite.Subsequently, nitrite was found to have additional benefits which increasedshelflife and safety of cured meats. Nitrite retards rancidity and inhibitsthe growth of some bacteria. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ As used in this document, the term ``nitrite'' refersto either sodium nitrite or potassium nitrite. However, unless specificallynoted otherwise, quantity declarations are stated on the basis of the sodiumsalt. A conversion to approximate potassium salt equivalent is accomplishedby multiplying by 1.23. The use of nitrite and nitrate in the curing of meat has been an area ofconcern to the Department for several years since it was learned that nitrite,when combined with secondary and tertiary amines under appropriate conditions,can form nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are formed during the high heat of some cooking processessuch as frying. Bacon containing confirmable levels of nitrosamines isan adulterated product. Many of the nitrosamines, including those foundin fried bacon, have been demonstrated to be carcinogenic to laboratoryanimals.\2\<NOTE/> If confirmable levels of nitrosamines are verified by gasliquid chromotography/mass spectrometry analysis (GLC/MS), the entire lotis disposed of in a manner to assure that nitrosamines will not form whenthe product is cooked. This may include incorporation of the uncooked baconas an ingredient in another food product, provided it is processed in amanner to preclude the formation of nitrosamines. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Preussman, R., Schmohl, D. andamp; Eisenbrand, G. (1977)Carcinogenicity of N-nitrosopyrrolidine: dose study in rats. <T3>Z. Krebsforsh 90 </T3>161-166. Bacon may be produced by any of three principal curing methods. Most bacon,about 98 percent, is prepared by injecting or tumbling a curing solutioncontaining water, salt, flavorings and nitrite into pork bellies so thatthere is an immediate penetration of the cure into the muscle tissues.This is referred to as pumped bacon. The other two percent are dividedbetween immersion cured and dry cured bacon. Immersion cured bacon is preparedby placing pork bellies in vats and then either covering them with thecuring solution or permitting the natural tissue fluids extracted by thecure to cover the bacon. Dry cured bacon is produced by rubbing a dry mixtureof salt, flavorings and nitrite onto the surface of each pork belly. Thedry cure must be dissolved by the natural tissue fluids and allowed todiffuse throughout the meat. The curing time is shortest for pumped baconand longest for dry cured bacon. Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for assuringthat meat and meat food products distributed to consumers are wholesomeand not adulterated (21 U.S.C. 602). Section 6 of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 606)directs the Secretary, through inspectors, to examine all meat food productsprepared for distribution in commerce in any slaughtering, meat canning,salting, packing, rendering, or similar establishment. Inspectors shallmark or label as ``Inspected and passed'' all such products found to benot adulterated and ``Inspected and condemned'' all such products foundto be adulterated within the meaning of section 1(m) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C.601(m)).Section 1(m) of the FMIA defines an adulterated product, in part, as productthat `` * * * bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substancewhich may render it injurious to health * * * '' (21 U.S.C. 601(m)(1)).In response to the finding of nitrosamines in bacon, the Department publisheda final regulation, in 1978, prohibiting the use of nitrate in pumped bacon,limiting the amount of ingoing nitrite in pumped bacon to 120 ppm, andrequiring that sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate be used at 550 ppm(43 FR 20992) (9 CFR 318.7(b)). Sodium ascorbate and sodium erythorbateare considered to be nitrosamine inhibitors and thus, capable of decreasingnitrosamine formation in bacon. Since that time, an active sampling andnitrosamine testing program for pumped bacon has been in effect. In addition,the Department provided in 1986 two alternative procedures for controllingthe levels of nitrite added to pumped bacon. First, as part of an FSISapproved quality control (QC) program, establishments are allowed to reduceingoing sodium nitrite levels to 100 ppm (or 123 ppm potassium nitrite)and 550 ppm sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate. The second alternative,also as part of an FSIS approved QC program, allows establishments to addsodium nitrite at a level between 40 and 80 ppm (or 49 to 99 ppm potassiumnitrite) with 550 ppm sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate plus sugarand starter cultures (lactic acid producing bacteria). In 1985 and 1986,the Department authorized the use of alpha-tocopherol as an additionalnitrosamine inhibitor in pumped bacon (50 FR 27573, 51 FR 35630). Although FSIS did not address the levels of nitrites and nitrates in drycured products in the rulemaking proceedings concerning pumped bacon, FSISdid begin research on the issue of nitrosamines in dry cured products.1. In a 1976 market basket survey, the Food and Drug Administration testedone sample of dry cured bacon. No nitrosamines were detected; however,formulation of the cure and processing procedures were unknown.2. In October 1977, FSIS published a notice (42 FR 55626) requesting informationas to whether carcinogenic nitrosamines are formed in cured meat productsas a result of ordinary conditions of processing and/or preparation forconsumption. The Nitrite Safety Council, an organization composed of representativesfrom several meat processor trade associations, submitted data \3\<NOTE/> in response to this request. The data consisted of the analyticalresults from 15 samples of dry cured bacon collected and analyzed by theNitrite Safety Council. Of these samples, 13 had been cured with nitrite,or nitrite and nitrate in combination. The ingoing range was from .027ounces of nitrite alone per 100 pounds of meat to 3 ounces of nitrate plus1 ounce of nitrite per 100 pounds of meat. One of the other two samplesreceived the maximum allowable amount of sodium nitrate (3.5 ounces per100 pounds of meat) but no nitrite. Nitrosamines were not found at confirmablelevels in this sample. In the 13 samples in which nitrite had been usedin processing, findings by the mineral oil vacuum distillation and thermalenergy analyzer (TEA) screening test ranged from undetectable to 180 partsper billion (ppb) of nitrosopyrrolidine (a carcinogenic nitrosamine). Sevenof the 13 findings indicated that carcinogenic nitrosamines were presentat levels of 10 ppb or greater.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ A copy of this data is available for public inspectionin the office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk.The Department monitored the collection and preparation of the samplesanalyzed by the Council. In addition, the Department analyzed companionsamples to those tested by the Council. These monitoring results, includingsuccessful confirmation in all cases attempted, established the validityof the data submitted by the Council.3. To get additional information on the occurrence of nitrosamines in baconmade with dry curing materials, the Department, in 1978, tested 39 additionalbacon samples.\4\<NOTE/> The results of the screening tests ranged from undetectableto 199 ppb. In 18 of the 39 samples, there were levels of carcinogenicnitrosamines widely recognized by scientists as confirmable. Three of thesesamples were selected as part of a nine-sample confirmation effort forTEA results. In all three cases, the presence of carcinogenic nitrosamineswas confirmed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The 39 bacon samples were part of a larger survey conductedby the Department on dry cured hams, pork shoulders, and bacon.4. Finally, in 1979, the Nitrite Safety Council reported additional dataas part of a small study \5\<NOTE/> to determine the effect of reducing ingoing nitrite to 120ppm and adding sodium erythorbate as a nitrosamine inhibitor in pork bellies.The study was conducted in four cooperating processing establishments.Analyses of the samples were limited to a TEA screening of 10 individualpork bellies from one establishment and three 10-belly composite sampleseach from a different establishment. Analyses of these pork bellies revealedthe presence of nitrosamines from 4 to 16 ppb in the individual belliesand 8 to 18 ppb in the composite belly samples. Although the Council reportedthat the results indicate that acceptable dry cured bacon with a very lowpotential for nitrosamine formation can be produced by using reduced levelsof added sodium nitrite coupled with sodium erythorbate, the study wastoo small to permit the Department to draw any firm conclusions. However,nitrosamines were found in one of the composite samples.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ A copy of this study is available for public inspectionin the office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk.As can be seen from the foregoing data, the incidence of confirmable levelsof nitrosamines in bacon prepared with dry curing materials appeared high.Therefore, FSIS on June 27, 1980, published a proposed rule (45 FR 43425)to regulate production procedures for dry cured bacon. The proposal wouldhave established a monitoring program and specific requirements for wateractivity and salt content. Most of the 117 commenters opposed the proposedrule because they believed the proposed water activity and salt contentwould make the product unsalable. Commenters also believe the monitoringprogram would result in many small processors closing. The commenters assertedthat the cost of having a private laboratory test the product would exceedthe value of the product. The alternative would be to have the Departmentperform the tests. It would take longer to get results, and the processorswould not have enough storage capacity to continue production and remainin business.Following publication of the proposal in 1980, FSIS formed an expert taskforce to study the manufacture of dry cured bacon. The task force initiateda survey \6\<NOTE/> of dry cured bacon producers to gather information on thecurrent production practices. Producers were asked to voluntarily submitformulations and samples of dry cured product for laboratory testing. Ofthe 143 samples which were submitted, 135 were tested by the Department.The samples were analyzed for residual nitrite and nitrate, salt, moisture,nitrosamines, pH, fat, protein, and water activity. As a result of theseanalyses, the Department determined that residual nitrite was the mostimportant contributing factor to the presence of detectable nitrosamines.The task force prepared guidelines in 1983 for the manufacture of dry curedbacon. The guidelines recommend that manufacturers carefully control nitriteby (1) accurately measuring the amount added, (2) adding no more than 200ppm of nitrite and (3) adding no nitrate. In addition, the guidelines recommendedthat bellies should be sorted according to weight and thickness; that belliesshould not be cured for more than 7 days per inch of thickness at 36-43anddegrees;F.; and that bellies should be cured with the skin off and notprocessed to excessive dryness.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ A copy of this survey report is available for public inspectionin the office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk.Although the 1980 survey was not intended to include immersion cured bacon,six samples were received which had been cured by this method. Five ofthe six samples had nitrosopyrrolidine levels greater than 10 ppb, andthree of these samples had levels greater than 20 ppb. These data indicatethat immersion cured bacon also has a significant potential for nitrosamineformation. To verify these findings and assess the nitrosamine levels inimmersion cured bacon an additional survey was done in 1980. This surveytested 59 samples of regular immersion cured bacon. Forty-nine percentof these samples had nitrosamine values equal to or greater than 17 ppb.This survey confirmed that immersion cured bacon has a potential for nitrosamineformation which is associated with residual nitrite in the raw product.In 1986, FSIS requested research by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS)to evaluate processing practices that the task force survey identifiedas significantly affecting the nitrosamine levels. ARS selected establishmentsfrom the 1980 FSIS survey whose processes would be likely to produce detectablenitrosamines. However, this research was conducted after those establishmentshad received copies of the task forces' recommended guidelines. Preliminaryinformation indicates that most of the establishments had amended theirprocesses, no longer used nitrate, and had no detectable nitrosamines.The final report has been submitted for publication.In view of the comments on the previous proposal and the information developedby the 1980 task force survey, FSIS is withdrawing the proposed rule publishedon June 27, 1980 (45 FR 43425), and is proposing to permit the manufactureof immersion cured and dry cured bacon made with accurately controlledreduced amounts of nitrite and no nitrate. It has been shown that nitrosamineformation in bacon is directly dependent on levels of residual nitriteleft in the bacon after the curing process. By accurately controlling theamount of nitrite added during the curing process, the residual nitriteshould be low enough to minimize any nitrosamine formation.The Agency has decided not to propose a laboratory monitoring test systemfor immersion cured and dry cured bacon at this time. The production schedulesof immersion cured and dry cured bacon producers can be intermittent andunpredictable. This makes the sample collection required by any statisticalmonitoring system difficult for these products. Instead, FSIS personnelwill, through inplant observations and control of formulation, verify thatimmersion cured bacon and dry cured bacon are wholesome and are being producedin accordance with these regulations.A recent innovation in bacon manufacturing has been the introduction ofmassaged bacon. In this process pork bellies are placed in drums with thecuring solution and tumbled until the cure is absorbed. All of the curingsolution is incorporated into the bacon. As such, it is similar to pumpedbacon where the curing solution is injected into the pork belly. In recognizingthe similarity between these two products, FSIS proposes to treat themthe same and apply the pumped bacon requirements to massaged bacon.Effect of This ProposalThis proposal would clarify andSection; 318.7(b) of the Federal meat inspectionregulations (9 CFR 318.7(b)) so that the provisions of the regulation whichpertain only to pumped bacon (9 CFR 318.7(b)(1)) would be so designatedbecause the requirements pertaining to bacon made with dry curing materialsare different. Immersion cured bacon requirements would also be shown separatelywith the use of ingoing nitrite at 120 ppm, or an equivalent amount ofpotassium nitrite (148 ppm). These are the same amounts as for pumped bacon.Since the cure ingredients are already in solution surrounding the porkbellies, diffusion of the nitrite into the product is facilitated.For dry cured bacon, the manner by which dry curing materials enter thepork bellies is essentially one of absorption. For dry cured bacon, nitritewould be limited to 200 ppm going into the product. To accurately controlthe amount of nitrite in the product and because of the variability ofthe conversion of nitrate to nitrite, the use of nitrate would be prohibitedin both immersion cured bacon and dry cured bacon as it now is in pumpedbacon. In proposing this rule, FSIS is aware of the need to minimize economicdisruption and, at the same time, meet consumer expectation. Therefore,it will continue to work with industry groups to assist in identifyingthose production methods and/or procedures that will result in a productin compliance with the Federal Meat Inspection Act; i.e., a product thatdoes not contain confirmable levels of carcinogenic nitrosamines. If thisproposal is issued as a final rule, as successful methods are identified,FSIS will provide technical guidance to those industry members who requesthelp in instituting them. Other Modifications: In the preparation of this proposal, two typographicalerrors were discovered in the chart in andSection;318.7(c)(4) of the regulations(9 CFR 318.7(c)(4)). In each instance the word ``nitrate'' should be ``nitrite''.Accordingly, this proposal would correct those errors. Proposal For reasons set forth in the preamble, Title 9, Subchapter A, Part 318,of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as set forthbelow: <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 318 </ITAG>Food additives, Meat inspection. <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 318_ENTRY INTO OFFICIAL ESTABLISHMENTS: REINSPECTION AND PREPARATIONOF PRODUCTS </ITAG>1.
