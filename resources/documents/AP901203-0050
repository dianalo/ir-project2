The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, commentedafter U.S. Energy Secretary James Watkins met Sunday with his SaudiArabian counterpart, Hisham Nazer.   Watkins arrived Saturday for talks on the oil market situationin light of Iraq's 4-month-long occupation of Kuwait. Saudi Arabiacontrols more than a quarter of the world's known oil reserves. Byovertaking Kuwait, Iraq increased its share of the world's oilreserves to 20 percent.   Saudi official statements only mentioned that the two mendiscussed the world oil market and means of stabilizing it as wellas bilateral cooperation in the oil industry. No details weregiven.   The U.S. Embassy official said that Watkins and Nazer talkedabout the effect of the Persian Gulf crisis on the world oilmarket, as well as U.S.-Saudi relations.   ``They discussed U.S. plans to use strategic petroleum reservesin case hostilities broke out and a real shortage emerged,'' saidthe diplomat. ``People tend to panic when a conflict breaks out,but we'll do whatever we can to maintain stability.''   The United States, Germany, and Japan together have about 1billion barrels of oil in reserve. Saudi Arabia's reserves stand atapproximately 260 billion barrels. Two months ago, President Bushsaid the United States would sell 5 million barrels of the 590million stored in 65 salt-dome caverns in Texas and Louisiana in anattempt to stabilize prices.   Before heading to the United Arab Emirates today, Watkinsvisited Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil-producing company.   Informed sources said on Sunday that discussions by Watkins andNazer included expansion of Saudi Aramco, an oil contingency planin case of war, and the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has played aprominent role in almost doubling its oil output to meet theshortage on the world market precipitated by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasionof Kuwait.   The move, along with additional production by other OPECmembers, have helped stabilize oil prices. They doubled to around$40 a barrel at one point, and now are about $30 dollars perbarrel. War could push oil prices as high as $100 per barrel,according to some estimates.</TEXT></DOC>
