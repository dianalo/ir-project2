Garcia</HL><DD> 06/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices extended Monday's advance by a small margin yesterday, despite a weaker dollar and lower bond prices.    Airline and other transportation stocks continued to be strong, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average closing at its fourth consecutive record, up 11.92 points at 1013.34.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.06 to 2352.70 after gaining 25.49 points Monday. The industrial average bounced around in a narrow trading range, following movements in the dollar and bond prices. The lower dollar and bonds seemed to damp some of the foreign demand for U.S. stocks, traders said.    The broader market fared a little better than blue-chips. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.56 to 297.28, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.25 to 167.38.    Traders noted that volume strengthened. Turnover on the Big Board rose to 164.2 million shares from 136.4 million Monday. Advancing issues had a slight lead over decliners.    The gains extended to the over-the-counter market, where the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.26 to 421.67. Volume rose to 139.3 million shares from 116.9 million Monday, with 1,273 issues advancing and 971 declining.    The continued advance in the Dow Jones Transportation Average has added some pep to some analysts' market outlook. Newton Zinder, a technical analyst at E.F. Hutton, said the transportation average often leads the market.    He said that transportation stocks act as bellwethers because these companies are usually sensitive to the economy's strength or weakness. &quot;Strength here could portend a better economy&quot; than some recent economic statistics might suggest, he said.    Eric Miller, a market strategist at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, said anecdotal evidence from various companies also suggests some improvement in the economy that may not be showing up yet in broader data.    According to Mr. Zinder and other analysts, takeover speculation about some railroad stocks and the takeover fight for Allegis, the parent company of United Airlines, have also made hefty contributions to the recent advance in the transportation average.    But Mr. Zinder cautioned that besides transportation issues, the market is showing &quot;diffused leadership,&quot; with one group of stocks having center stage one day and then falling back while another group jumps up in. &quot;It's hard to pick out where the real strength in the market is.&quot;    Semiconductor stocks were active on news of continued improvement last month in orders and shipments. Motorola added 1 1/8 to 54 3/4, Texas Instruments rose 6 to 175 3/4, Advanced Micro Devices gained 3/8 to 21 3/4 and AMP advanced 1 3/8 to 57 1/8. Intel rose 1 3/4 to 43 1/4 on volume of more than two million shares in the OTC market.    Data from the Semiconductor Industry Association showed that orders in May rose 7.4% from April, and shipments increased 2.9%.    Analysts cautioned that business may be less brisk than the figures indicate, based on what they are hearing from the semiconductor companies they follow. James Barlage at Smith Barney Harris Upham said that at larger companies, it appears order growth has leveled off and they are no longer posting the increasingly large gains seen in the industry data.    Thomas Kurlak at Merrill Lynch added that some of the current demand for semiconductor chips might not be sustainable. He said that Japanese manufacturers have cut back production in response to the tariffs imposed by the Reagan administration. Now that some of the tariffs have been lifted and chip prices have risen in world markets, the Japanese will increase production and U.S. makers might lose some of their edge.    Orders for semiconductor products traditionally slow down in the summer months. But Mr. Barlage said if stocks slump a bit in the summer, it could be a buying opportunity for investors because he expects both orders and the stocks to perk up again in the fall.    Other technology stocks were mixed. International Business Machines fell 1 3/8 to 159 7/8, Digital Equipment rose 2 to 166 3/8, Honeywell added 1 3/4 to 81 3/8 and Microsoft lost 3/4 to 109 in OTC trading.    Genentech moved up 2 1/4 to 42 1/4 as more than 2.1 million shares changed hands in the OTC market. Genentech and Wellcome PLC are suing each other for the right to market an anti-clotting drug, TPA, which analysts believe could be an extremely lucrative product.    Detroit Edison was unchanged at 17 1/8 on more than 12.2 million shares. The stock, which yields 9.8%, begins trading ex-dividend today. Traders said activity centered on capturing the approaching dividend payment.    Dayton-Hudson moved up 2 3/8 to 52 3/4 on more than two million shares. The company said it didn't know of any reason for the higher price or the increased trading activity. Traders said takeover speculation about the company continued. Dart Group was rumored to be interested in Dayton-Hudson, but declined comment. One trader added that yesterday's active June and July call options for the company may account for much of the volume.    BankAmerica fell 1/8 to 11 3/8. The bank holding company announced late Monday that it was adding $1.1 billion to loan-loss reserves. The addition to reserves would result in a $1 billion loss in the second quarter.    Manufacturers Hanover eased 5/8 to 43 1/8. The bank said it is considering adding $1.75 billion to its reserves for troubled loans.    Other bank stocks were fractionally higher. With BankAmerica and Manufacturers joining other banks in beefing up their loan-loss reserves, analysts believe still more major banks will follow. These two banks are considered the weakest among the biggest U.S. lenders to less-developed countries.    Tektronix moved up 3 5/8 to 37 5/8 in active trading. The company said it will begin a Dutch auction tender offer today for as many as 10 million shares. Under the auction process, Tektronix is inviting shareholders to tender shares at prices of at least $35 and at most $40 a share.    Pay 'N Pak gained 1/2 to 21 1/8. Florida investor Paul A. Bilzerian sweetened his tender offer to acquire the company at $22 a share in cash and securities. Monday, Pay 'N Pak accepted a leveraged buyout offer from a management group valued at $212.5 million.    Caesars World fell 3/4 to 33 7/8. A federal judge in Los Angeles derailed Martin Sosnoff's $35-a-share takeover bid for the company, saying it violated a Federal Reserve financing rule. He also asked Caesars to delay for at least a month its proposed recapitalization plan.    Lone Star Technologies rose 1 to 15 1/2. The stock was recommended by a Wall Street firm. </TEXT></DOC>
