Jay Klopfenstein, Norwood's president, said that &quot;too many trend following managers trying to do the same thing and thereby hurting each other,&quot; and an extended period of disinflation may account for much of the monthly losses by three-fourths of the commodity funds Norwood tracks.    The November loss brought average results for the first 11 months of the year to a loss of 10.5%.    Public commodity funds are pools of money managed by professionals and offering limited partnership units, usually priced at about $1,000 each, to investors.    The funds Norwood monitors have total trading capital of about $570 million. </TEXT></DOC>
