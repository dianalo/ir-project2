The estimated average burden associated withthe collection of information in this final rule is one hour per response.Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestionsfor reducing this burden should be directed to John R.

In particular, substantial changes are being made inregard to exemptions from the deposit insurance requirement, the currentcapital equivalency ledger account provision, and the country exposureprovision. Other changes, primarily technical, are being made to provisionsconcerning the pledge of assets. There are also a number of miscellaneouschanges throughout the regulation. The FDIC received six comments on theproposal, three from bankers' associations (the Institute of InternationalBankers, the Canadian Bankers' Association, and the Bankers' Associationfor Foreign Trade), two from law firms, and one from the State of New YorkBanking Department.The capital equivalency ledger account provision will be changed, largelyas proposed, to asset maintenance. The limited comment on this provisiongenerally favored a return to asset maintenance. An insured branch willbe required to maintain eligible assets, as defined in andSection; 346.20,in an amount not less than 106% of the preceding quarter's average bookvalue of the branch's third-party liabilities or, in the case of a newlyestablished branch, the average book value of the branch's estimated third-partyliabilities for the first full quarter of operation. The proposed additionsto the current exclusion from eligibility of assets designated ``OtherTransfer Risk Problem,'' or classified ``Substandard,'' ``Doubtful,'' or``Value Impaired'' for asset maintenance purposes will be modified to makethe exclusion more similar to capital requirements for domestic banks;specifically, any asset classified ``Value Impaired'' to the extent ofthe required Allocated Transfer Risk Reserves, as defined in 12 CFR 351.1,or the equivalent write down (this amount is the functional equivalentof ``Loss'') or ``Loss'' will be excluded. Some comments advocated a nationaltreatment approach on this point, and these changes are being made in theinterest of such an approach.Although some comments suggested that daily maintenance should not be requiredand that, if it is, calculation should be on a weekly basis, the FDIC hasdecided to retain the requirement for daily maintenance. The FDIC believesthat the asset maintenance requirement is analogous to a domestic bank'srequired capital. Domestic banks must maintain required levels of capitalon a daily basis, and there is no compelling reason to allow anything otherthan a continuous mainteance of the required asset level for insured branches.It was also suggested that the FDIC consider basing asset maintenance requirementson a semi-annual, rather than a quarterly, average book value of the branch'sliabilities. Domestic banks' minimum capital requirement is based on averagetotal assets as reported in the quarterly call reports. Therefore, in orderto have as much similarity as possible in this matter between domesticbanks and insured branches, the suggestion of a semi-annual average isrejected in favor of the quarterly period proposed. Some comment concerned the requirements for waivers of offset in regardto both the asset maintenance and asset pledge provisions. Commenters believethat the requirement is burdensome and/or without substantial benefit andthat funds may be placed on a basis other than the condition of the bankholding the deposit (<T3>i.e.</T3>, on the basis of a willingness to grant the required waiver).The FDIC continues to be of the opinion that the benefits of such waivers,particularly in a liquidation context, outweigh the burdens. The FDIC has,therefore, decided to retain the requirement.As noted in the proposal, the federal bank regulatory agencies are formulatinga new capital policy which takes a risk-based approach to capital requirements.At this time, the new capital policy will not be embodied in Part 346,but the FDIC does plan to evaluate whether to apply the principles of thatpolicy to insured branches of foreign banks.The comments overwhelmingly favored the proposed elimination of the currentrestrictions on country exposure at andSection; 346.23 and the country exposureexclusion in the current capital equivalency ledger account, and the restrictionswill be eliminated. (The publication here of this final regulation constitutesthe required notice specified in 53 FR 51093 (December 20, 1988) that andSection;346.23 is being removed.) As noted in the proposal, however, both in referenceto the asset maintenance and asset pledge provisions, the FDIC may require,after consulting with the branch's primary regulator, a higher ratio ofeligible assets and/or an increase in pledged assets, respectively, basedon the concentration of risk to any one borrower or group of related borrowersor the concentration of transfer risk to any one country, including thecountry in which the branch's head office is located. Some commentary notedthat the issue of appropriate loan limits is the province of the primaryregulator and that if required increases were imposed based on loans toone borrower at less than the legal lending limit, this practice wouldusurp the primary regulator's authority and put branches at a competitivedisadvantage with domestic banks whose loan limits are based on the bank'stotal assets or capital. Accordingly, the comment suggested deletion ofthe language regarding concentration of risks to one borrower or groupsof borrowers. The comment also suggested the addition of preamble languagediscussing the factors to be considered. The FDIC as insurer must lookespecially at risks to individual branches, since its responsibility isfor individual branches; consequently, we believe the considerations notedare both wise and justified.Branches which are under orders containing explicit country exposure limitsmay petition the FDIC to amend those orders. Such petitions should be directedto the Regional Director (DBS) of the region in which the insured branchis located.Except as noted, changes are being made as they were proposed to the pledgeof assets provision. (Although comment on this proposal was limited, itwas favorable, with a few suggestions for additions or clarification.)As proposed, andSection; 346.19(d)(7) would allow notes issued by U.S. banks,bank holding companies, or U.S. branches of foreign banks to be includedas assets eligible to be pledged if those notes have a credit rating withinthe top two rating bands of a nationally-recognized rating service (withany conflict in the ratings to be resolved in favor of the lowest rating).The notes would also have to be payable in the United States and issuedby other than an affiliate of the pledging foreign bank. In response toa comment, eligible notes of U.S. agencies of foreign banks are being addedto this provision. If proposed Part 354, published at 53 FR 47723 (November25, 1988), regarding deposit liabilities is adopted in final form, thewaiver of offset will be applied to those liabilities which become deposits;comment is also specifically being requested for a 60-day period on thispoint.Branches should note that the FDIC is drafting a new model pledge agreement,to be used both for new insured branches and for existing insured branches.Once the documents are drafted, further information will be forwarded toinsured branches.The proposal contained major changes in the provision relating to exemptionsfrom the deposit insurance requirement (andSection; 346.6). Most of the significantcomment received focused on these proposed changes, primarily opposingthe elimination of the ``de minimis'' rule and favoring the exemption forbusinesses. The comments argued that the ``de minimis'' rule was not currentlybeing violated and that it served useful purposes, including allowing someleeway for inadvertent or small retail deposits. Various suggestions foradditions to the exclusions were made. After considering all of the comments,the FDIC has decided to adopt the proposed business exemption at andSection;346.6(a)(1). In addition, in order to accommodate the concerns expressedby the comments, the FDIC has decided to retain the ``de minimis'' rule,but increase the percentage from four percent to five percent and eliminateboth the checklist proposed at andSection; 346.6(a)(5) and the current andSection;346.6(a)(7) which is embodied in the proposal as andSection; 346.6(a)(6).The FDIC believes that increase of the ``de minimis'' level gives branchesmore discretion, makes for administrative ease, and accommodates the othersituations covered by the provisions not being included in the final rule.Comment is invited on the final changes and specifically on the eliminationof current andSection; 346.6(a)(7). Should the elimination of current andSection;346.6(a)(7), in spite of the increase in the ``de minimis'' rule, resultin a branch's being required to obtain deposit insurance, the branch shouldcomment within 60 days and so inform the FDIC. If the regulation as itis now drafted becomes final, those commenters who need to file depositinsurance applications will be notified. One comment noted a perceivedambiguity in the meaning of the term ``resides'' in andSection; 346.6(a)(7).The FDIC believes that andSection; 346.6(a)(7) is no longer necessary, andits elimination also negates the need to consider any possible ambiguity.There is an extremely important point to be made in regard to the exemptionsfrom the deposit insurance requirement. As noted in the proposal, the entireprovision, including the ``de minimis'' provision, is keyed to the conceptof ``initial deposit.'' Based on the comments, it appears that branchesmay not be calculating the exemption properly. The ``de minimis'' rulecomputation includes only the deposits of those whose initial depositswere under $100,000; it does not include all deposits of under $100,000in the branch. Branches are strongly cautioned that it is imperative thatthey keep records identifying such initial deposits.One comment in particular commented on the perceived ambiguity of the definitionof ``initial deposit'' at andSection; 346.1(k). The definition says thatan ``initial deposit'' is the first deposit transaction between the depositorand the branch. ``First,'' however, refers to the first transaction whenthere are no other existing deposit relationships. Thus, if a depositorcloses all accounts with the branch in 1989 and establishes a new accountin 1999, the 1999 deposit constitutes an ``initial deposit.'' Althoughthe FDIC does not believe that situations such as this pose significantproblems, language is being added to andSection; 346.1(k) to clarify theFDIC's position. Although the FDIC is not making other changes at thistime, the comment period has made the FDIC very aware of the apparent difficultyand confusion surrounding the concept of an ``initial deposit.'' For thatreason, the FDIC is requesting comment on this issue and especially onwhether changes should be made to the means of measuring whether a branchis engaged in domestic retail deposit activity or is receiving depositsof less than $100,000. <T3>See</T3> 12 U.S.C. 3104.Proposed amendments to andSection; 346.7, concerning notification to depositors,are also being adopted. As proposed, negotiable certificates of depositof more than $100,000 are no longer to be exempted from the requirementof either a statement on a form evidencing a deposit or an acknowledgmentby the depositor. Although one comment noted that such deposits shouldbe exempted because ``sophisticated investors'' and large amounts are involvedand because similar notification is not required for large uninsured depositsin a domestic bank, the FDIC fails to find these arguments convincing.First, the FDIC's experience does not show that ``sophisticated'' depositorsare uninterested in the deposit insurance framework. Second, no notificationis given to depositors of a domestic bank because almost all domestic banksare insured; and in the case of an insured bank, all deposits, whetherthey be in branches or main offices, are insured up to allowable limits.The situation of an uninsured branch is simply not analogous. The additionalnotification will be required on a prospective basis, however, includingany renewals.Some technical and stylistic changes are also being made. Other proposedchanges are being adopted as proposed. One comment stated that burdensomechanges should be phased in gradually. The FDIC believes that a delayed90-day effective date, except as noted above in regard to notificationsof uninsured status for negotiable certificates of deposits, is fair; andsuch an effective date is hereby adopted. The regulation is being adoptedin final form, although we are interested in receiving comment on severalmatters. As discussed above, we are requesting comment on the concept ofthe ``initial deposit'' as a means of measuring retail deposit activity(andSection; 346.6), on the exemptions from the deposit insurance requirementas they are being adopted as final changes (andSection; 346.6(a)), and onthe application of the waiver of offset to notes which are included byregulation within the term ``deposit'' (see andSection; 346.19(d)(1)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>In the proposed rule, the Board of Directors certified that the rule wouldnot, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>.). There are presently 22 foreign banks which have insuredbranches, and they are world-wide institutions with assets ranging fromapproximately $1 to $240 billion. In light of the above-noted certification,the Regulatory Flexibility Act requirement of 5 U.S.C. 604 that a finalregulatory flexibility analysis be prepared does not apply.In addition, pursuant to the FDIC's statement of policy on the draftingof regulations, it has been determined that a cost-benefit analysis, includinga small bank impact statement, is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>12 CFR Part 303Administrative practice and procedure, Authority delegations, Bank depositinsurance, Banks, banking.12 CFR Part 346Bank deposit insurance, Foreign banks, banking, Banks, banking, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.For the reasons stated in this notice, and pursuant to the FDIC's authorityunder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and International Banking Act,FDIC hereby amends Parts 303 and 346 of title 12 of the <T3>Code of Federal Regulations </T3>as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 303_APPLICATIONS, REQUESTS, SUBMITTALS, DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY,AND NOTICES OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL</ITAG>1.

Section 346.20 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 346.20 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Asset maintenance.</ITAG>(a) An insured branch of a foreign bank shall maintain on a daily basiseligible assets in an amount not less than 106% of the preceding quarter'saverage book value of the branch's liabilities or, in the case of a newly-establishedbranch, the estimated book value of its liabilities at the end of the firstfull quarter of operation, exclusive of liabilities due to the foreignbank's head office, other branches, agencies, offices, or wholly ownedsubsidiaries. The Director of the Division of Bank Supervision or his designeemay impose a computation of total liabilities on a daily basis in thoseinstances where it is found necessary for supervisory purposes. The Boardof Directors, after consulting with the branch's primary regulator, mayrequire that a higher ratio of eligible assets be maintained if the financialcondition of the branch warrants such action. Among the factors which willbe considered in requiring a higher ratio of eligible assets are the concentrationof risk to any one borrower or group of related borrowers or the concentrationof transfer risk to any one country, including the country in which theforeign bank's head office is located. Eligible assets shall be payablein United States dollars or in a currency freely convertible into UnitedStates dollars.(b) In determining eligible assets for the purposes of compliance withparagraph (a), the branch shall exclude the following:(1) Any asset due from the foreign bank's head office, other branches,agencies, offices or affiliates;(2) Any asset classified ``Value Impaired,'' to the extend of the requiredAllocated Transfer Risk Reserves or equivalent write down, or ``Loss''in the most recent state or federal examination report;(3) Any deposit of the branch in a bank unless the bank has executed avalid waiver of offset agreement:(4) Any asset not supported by sufficient credit information to allow areview of the asset's credit quality, as determined at the most recentstate or federal examination; \4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Whether an asset has sufficient credit information willbe a function of the size of the borrower and the location within the foreignbank of the responsibility for authorizing and monitoring extensions ofcredit to the borrower. For large, well known companies, when credit responsibilityis located in an office of the foreign bank outside the insured branch,the branch must have adequate documentation to show that the asset is ofgood quality and is being supervised adequately by the bank. In such cases,copies of periodic memoranda that include an analysis of the borrower'srecent financial statements and a report on recent developments in theborrower's operations and borrowing relationships with the bank generallywould constitute sufficient information. For other borrowers, periodicmemoranda must be supplemented by information such as copies of recentfinancial statements, recent correspondence concerning the borrower's financialcondition and repayment history, credit terms and collateral, data on anyguarantors, and where necessary, the status of any corrective measuresbeing employed.<ITAG tagnum="28">Subsequent to the determination that an asset lacks sufficient creditinformation, an insured branch may not include the amount of that assetamong eligible assets until the FDIC determines that sufficient documentationexists. Such a determination may be made either at the next federal examination,or upon request of the branch, by the regional director of the FDIC regionin which the branch is located.</ITAG>(5) Any asset not in the branch's actual possession unless the branch holdstitle to such asset and the branch maintains records sufficient to enableindependent verification of the branch's ownership of the asset, as determinedat the most recent state or federal examination;(6) Any intangible asset.(c) A foreign bank which has more than one insured branch in a state maytreat all of its insured branches in the same state as one entity for purposesof compliance with paragraph (a) and shall designate one branch to be responsiblefor maintaining the records of the branches' compliance with this section.(d) The average book value of the branch's liabilities for a quarter shallbe, at the branch's option, either an average of the balances as of theclose of business for each day of the quarter or an average of the balancesas of the close of business on each Wednesday during the quarter. Quartersend on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of any given year.For days on which the branch is closed, balances from the previous businessday are to be used. Calculations of the average book value of the branch'sliabilities for a quarter shall be retained by the branch until the nextfederal examination.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;346.21 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> [Removed and Reserved]</ITAG>13.
