The marchers stopped within shouting distance of West Berlin'sInternational Congress Center, where World Bank and InternationalMonetary Fund talks were being held, and staged a giant protest.   Late Sunday night, smaller groups of demonstrators gathered inthe city, at one point turning over a police van downtown, policesaid.   Riot police circled one group of 200 protesters, who dispersedwithout incident. Another group of about 600 demonstratorsdispersed when police drove up in vans.   Organizers said about 80,000 people participated in the march,but police put the number at 27,000.   Police said militants hit three photographers taking picturesduring the 2{-mile march, but spokesmen for the demonstration saidthey believed undercover police officers were the assailants. Thephotographers were not hurt, police said.   Some people hurled stones at passing cars and threw paint-filledballoons at banks, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.   A police spokesman said ``a number of people were detained'' indemonstration-related disturbances, but he had no precise number orother details.   Masked radicals and German leftists joined activists from Asiaand Latin America and church group members. They carried bannersand chanted slogans denouncing the policies of industrial nationstoward debt-ridden poor nations. ``We have broken through thenational and political barriers,'' said march organizer DieterBricke, a leading member of West Germany's leftist Greens party.``There are members of the Catholic Church who are here marchingwith communists. That is quite an achievement.''   Walking about 30 abreast, the marchers chanted slogansdenouncing what they called the ``murderous polices'' of the WorldBank and International Monetary Fund.   The 151-nation IMF has spearheaded a program of financial aid todeveloping nations with enormous debts. The World Bank, its sisterorganization, offers these countries aid for economic developmentprograms.   But critics say conditions attached to the assistance arecrippling Third World countries and creating poverty.   Marchers carried banners reading ``The Profits of IMF Are TheMisery of the Third World,'' ``Stop Starvation,'' and``Imperialism, Your Days Are Numbered.'' Another banner showed abanker taking dollar bills from the ribs of a starving peasant.   Members of the Greens party, including Jutta Ditfurth, a memberof the West German Parliament, led protesters representing 120groups.   Protesters chanted ``IMF-Murder Fund!'' and ``IMF and World BankMust Go!''   The march began on Kurfuerstendamm, West Berlin's mainboulevard, and ended at a square about 1,000 feet from theInternational Congress Center. Armored cars and a mobile watercannons were parked near the square and ringed the congressbuilding.   The mostly young crowd was in good spirits, with some carryingchildren on their shoulders.   A convoy of 15 vans filled with police officers led theprotesters. Two columns of riot police wearing helmets and carryingshields and truncheons flanked a group of about 1,000 leftistextremists, many of whom wore ski masks to hide their identities.   About 10,000 police have guarded the city during the meetings,expected to draw 12,000 financial officials, bankers andjournalists. The discussions began Thursday and will last untilSept. 29.   About 2,700 police officers were brought in from across WestGermany to strengthen the city's security ranks.</TEXT></DOC>
