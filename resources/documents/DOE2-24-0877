<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0877 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have studied the relation between the resonating-valence-bond (RVB)state and the exact ground state for the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic(AF) Heisenberg model on a few small lattices. We describe a method toobtain the state of minimum energy within a family of RVB states. Basedon the insight provided by the RVB states, and supported by our numericalresults, we argue in favor of the existence of long-range order at T= 0 for the two-dimensional AF Heisenberg model.</TEXT></DOC>
