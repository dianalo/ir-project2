If found, contact the Philippine Department of PublicWorks.   Public Works Secretary Juanito Ferrer told a House ofRepresentatives committee on Tuesday that a recent survey found thegovernment had been paying about $400,000 a year for maintenance ofroads that don't exist.   Ferrer said corrupt officials were apparently pocketing themoney.   He said most of the ``ghost highways'' were in the northernLuzon island stronghold of ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.Others were in central Luzon, the central Visayas islands andMindanao.   It was the latest in a growing series of charges of corruptionwithin President Corazon Aquino's government.   Mrs. Aquino, who took office in February 1986, has pledged tocurb corruption, which was rampant in the Marcos administration.   But Filipino political commentators and others claim corruptionremains widespread in the government.</TEXT></DOC>
