Sources who spoke only on condition they not be identified saidthe Justice Department's public integrity section is examiningconflicting testimony by two former federal bankruptcy trustees andJustice Department officials during a U.S. Bankruptcy Courtproceeding last year involving INSLAW Inc.   Public integrity investigators also have allegations in theINSLAW case against Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Thoseallegations were relayed to the public integrity lawyers byindependent counsel James C. McKay, who has been investigatingMeese for almost a year.   ``We are not conducting an investigation with respect to theINSLAW matter,'' said Carol Bruce, McKay's deputy. ``Anyinformation we have received relating to it we have referred to theJustice Department's public integrity section.''   INSLAW alleges that Meese arranged to have their attorney, LeighRatiner, dismissed from his Washington law firm in 1986 after Meesediscussed the case with one of Ratiner's partners, Leonard Garment.   Garment, who described the allegation as ``pure baloney,'' saidhe was interviewed by public integrity lawyers about the allegationtwo months ago.   If the public integrity section finds the allegations aboutMeese are serious enough to warrant further investigation, it wouldsend them back to McKay, according to a source close to theindependent counsel.   The perjury investigation is the latest twist in a complicatedcase in which INSLAW Inc. charged _ and a bankruptcy judge, GeorgeF. Bason Jr., found _ that the Justice Department stole computersoftware the company had provided under a $10 million contract withthe department.   Bason ruled that the villain was a fired INSLAW employee whowent to work for the Justice Department with a consuming desire forrevenge.   Bason ordered the government to pay INSLAW $6.8 million for useof the software. He ruled last June that the Justice Department hadengaged in ``trickery, fraud and deceit' to steal the software. Thecase has been appealed.   Lawyers for INSLAW have alleged that Cornelius Blackshear, aformer U.S. trustee, lied in sworn depositions when questionedabout an attempt to force INSLAW's liquidation, sources said.   But the inquiry is focused on all the conflicting testimony inthe case.   Blackshear, a bankruptcy judge in New York City, changed histestimony about events that occurred when he was a U.S. trustee, inan affidavit and a second sworn deposition.   INSLAW, Inc., which filed for reorganization under bankruptcylaw in early 1985, charged in another action before Bason that theJustice Department had deliberately withheld $1.77 million inpayments on the contract to computerize 94 U.S. attorneys' offices.   Last year, Bason accepted INSLAW's contention that Thomas J.Stanton, head of the Executive Office of U.S. Trustees, also triedto pressure Blackshear into helping liquidate INSLAW's assets _ amove that would have put the company out of business.   When he announced his decision, Bason rejected Stanton's sworndenial of INSLAW's allegation that he had asked Blackshear to sendhis chief deputy to Washington to convert INSLAW's bankruptcyreorganization into a liquidation proceeing.   ``I found Mr. Stanton's testimony in crucial respects to beevasive and unbelievable ... the court simply finds that testimonyto be utterly incredible and unworthy of belief,'' said Bason, wholeft the bench earlier this year when his court appointment was notextended.   On March 25, 1987, Blackshear testified in the deposition thathe refused Stanton's request because it was improper. The next day,Blackshear signed an affidavit to retract the testimony, statingthat he was confusing INSLAW with another bankruptcy matter.   Blackshear gave a subsequent sworn deposition consistent withthe affidavit. Both of the judge's depositions were given inBlackshear's chambers. He did not return a reporter's repeatedtelephone calls.   Bason noted that Blackshear changed his testimony afterreceiving two telephone calls from William C. White, then the U.S.bankruptcy trustee in Alexandria, Va., who allegedly refusedStanton's initial request to liquidate INSLAW.   ``The inference is rather strong that Mr. White was trying topersuade Judge Blackshear that Mr. White's recollection was correctand Judge Blackshear's recollection was incorrect,'' Bason said inhis June 12, 1987 ruling from the bench.   ``I believe that Judge Blackshear's original testimony isaccurate and his recanted testimony is inaccurate,'' Bason said,calling the judge's recantation ``an honest mistake.''   Bason also found that White may have mistakenly rememberedevents when he denied that Stanton pressured White to liquidateINSLAW. Bason ruled that ``people do have a capacity to forgetthings when it is painful for them to remember _ or maybe eveninconvenient for them to remember.''   The judge found there was ``clear and convincing'' evidence thatStanton retaliated by White's refusal by refusing to expand White'sstaff in Alexandria.   Anthony Pasciuto, a former Justice Department official who alsotestified in the INSLAW case, meanwhile, has provided a freshallegation that Blackshear lied when he retracted his first story.   Pasciuto, who had been Stanton's deputy director foradministration, charged that Blackshear told him last summer, ``Ifelt the easiest thing I could do was recant.''   ``I felt less people would be hurt if I just bailed out,''Blackshear was quoted as saying in a letter by Pasciuto's attorney,Gary Simpson, to the Justice Department.   ``I thought that by changing my story I would hurt lesspeople,'' Simpson quoted Blackshear as telling Pasciuto.   Pasciuto has since joined a New York financial firm. He left thegovernment after the Justice Department's Office of ProfessionalResponsibility tried to dismiss him for violating department rulesby talking about the INSLAW case with William Hamilton, thecompany's president, and Hamilton's wife, Nancy.   Pasciuto told the Hamiltons last year that he had informationfrom Blackshear about pressure to liquidate the firm. But heretreated from this story during his courtroom testimony.   On the verge of tears in Bason's courtroom, Pasciuto hadtestified that he made up the story because he was angry withStanton about delaying his long-awaited promotion.   Simpson included the charge about Blackshear in a March 17letter he wrote to then-Assistant Attorney General Arnold I. Burnsto protest plans to fire Pasciuto, who was allowed to resign.   The conflicting testimony of Blackshear, White, Stanton andPasciuto is the subject of the public integrity inquiry, accordingto sources.   Bason ruled that Stanton sought to liquidate INSLAW to ``curryfavor'' with higher Justice Department officials after he spokewith C. Madison Brewer, who administered the INSLAW contract. Hisconduct has been the subject of a long-standing investigation bythe department's Office of Professional Responsibility.   In a subsequent ruling last year, Bason concluded that Brewerwas ``consumed by hatred and an intense desire for revenge''because he had been fired by INSLAW before going to work for theJustice Department.   Bason ruled that Brewer and others in the department stoleenhancements to INSLAW's case-tracking computer program known asPROMIS and engaged in ``an outrageous, deceitful, fraudulent gameof cat and mouse'' designed to destroy INSLAW.</TEXT></DOC>
