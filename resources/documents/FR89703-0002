Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2> Notice was given (54 FR 18905, Wednesday,May 3, 1989) that the Department proposed to amend the regulations governingthe fees and charges for the mandatory inspection and certification ofproducer tobacco sold at designated auction markets throughout the tobaccoproducing areas. Interested parties were given an opportunity to commenton the proposed rule. No comments were received.The Department hereby adopts the regulations appearing in the proposedrule which increases the fees and charges assessed by the Department forproviding inspection and certification of quota tobacco, the establishmentof standards, and other services. The new fee will cover the increasedcost of operating the program, including administrative and supervisorycosts. Authority for these regulations is contained in the Tobacco InspectionAct (7 U.S.C. 511-511q).The current fee of $.0055 per pound has been in effect since July 1, 1982,as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (47 FR 51722) on June 23, 1982.The Department conducts a yearly review of the financial status of thisprogram to determine whether the fee is sufficient. Receipts for the 1988-89marketing season were approximately $7,875,000. Anticipated expenses forthat period are approximately $9,252,000. For the past three seasons, theincreased costs of the tobacco inspection program forced the Departmentto draw upon funds in that program's reserve account. The major factorscausing the need for additional funds are increases in Government salaries,including a special salary rate for tobacco graders which was effectiveOctober 30, 1988, and increases in travel allowances and overall administrativecosts since 1982. An analysis of data available to the Department indicatesthat a fee of $.0067 per pound would cover expenses and maintain a reservethat would meet any reasonable contingency. Information on program incomeand expenses was presented to the National Advisory Committee for TobaccoInspection Services at its meeting on March 7, 1989, in Washington, DC.The National Advisory Committee, made up of 14 representatives from tobaccoproducer interested groups, was established under the Tobacco InspectionAct to advise the Secretary of Agriculture on the fees to be assessed,level of inspection service, and other related matters. The Committee adopteda motion, by a vote of eleven in favor and two opposed, to recommend tothe Secretary an increase in the fee of $.0070 per pound. However, basedon a recalculation of pounds under quota for the coming marketing season,a fee of $.0067 per pound was proposed.The marketing season for tobacco does not coincide with the Federal fiscalyear. Therefore, the increased rate is being made effective on July 1,1989, so as to treat all types of tobacco on an equal basis.This rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures established to implementExecutive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1 and has been determinedto be a ``nonmajor rule'' because it does not meet any of the criteriaestablished for major rules under the Executive Order.Additionally, in conformance with the provisions of Pub. L. 96-354, theRegulatory Flexibility Act, full consideration has been given to the potentialeconomic impact upon small business. Most of the firms which would be affectedby this rule are small businesses.Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration(13 CFR 121.2) as those having gross annual revenues for the last threeyears of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are definedas those whose gross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The Administrator,Agricultural Marketing Service, has determined that this action would nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.This final rule would not substantially affect the normal movement of thecommodity in the marketplace. Compliance with this final rule would notimpose substantial direct economic costs, recordkeeping, or personnel workloadchanges on small entities, and would not alter the market share or competitivepositions of small entities relative to the large entities and would inno way affect normal competition in the marketplace. Furthermore, the Departmentis required by law to fix and collect fees and charges to cover the Department'scost in operating the tobacco inspection program.In addition, good cause has been found to make this rule effective lessthan 30 days after publication because it is necessary that the new feebe effective at the beginning of the new marketing season which beginsin mid-July.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 29</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Tobacco.Accordingly, the Department hereby amends the regulations under the TobaccoInspection Act contained in 7 CFR Part 29 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 29_TOBACCO INSPECTION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Regulations</ITAG>1.
