Mexico, China and four smaller independent oil producers offeredto cut their exports by 5 percent if the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries makes a proportionally similar sacrifice.   All the OPEC members say they're pleased the offer was made, butfew said whether they like the idea.   Oil ministers from all 13 OPEC member countries arranged ameeting tonight to decide what to do about the proposal.   Some analysts say the plan, if accepted by OPEC and implementedby all 19 countries involved, probably would push oil prices up toOPEC's target of $18 a barrel. Most OPEC crudes are selling in theopen market for $16 a barrel or less.   The oil market in Europe was unsettled and slightly weaker todayin early trading, London-based traders said.   The price of Brent crude from the North Sea was down 25 cents,at $17.25 a barrel, roughly matching declines in late New Yorktrading on Wednesday.   Analysts said the market appeared to be viewing the OPEC talksas only a prelude to more crucial negotiations in June, when thecartel may face tough decisions about cutting production by largeramounts to avert a price slide.   ``For now they're just firefighting,'' said Paul McDonald, aLondon-based oil consultant.   Prices fell Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. TheJune contract West Texas Intermediate, the most widely traded U.S.crude, fell 33 cents to $18.27 a barrel.   Paul Mlotok, who monitored the OPEC talks for the New York-basedinvestment firm Salomon Brothers Inc., said the nations were ontarget for a possible agreement to boost prices.   But Mlotok acknowledged that OPEC rarely makes decisions aboutreducing its oil production or its exports without long, oftenunproductive negotiations.   Iran, a leading advocate of production cuts to help boostprices, said on Wednesday that it supported the independentproducers' proposal.   When a reporter asked Libyan Oil Minister Fawzi Shakshuki if hisgovernment could accept the plan, he replied: ``It depends.'' Hedidn't elaborate.   Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC president and oil minister of Nigeria,sought to evade reporters' questions about his country's positionon the export-cutting plan.   He stressed that this was the first time a group of non-OPEC oilproducers offered to restrain production as a gesture ofcooperation with the cartel.   ``It's a good proposal in that it's a proposal that we've neverhad before,'' he said.   The position of Saudi Arabia, the cartel's largest producer andthe world's biggest oil exporter, was equally unclear.   At one point Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told reporters,``We'd like greater participation'' in oil export cuts byindependent producers. He declined to say if his government favoredthe proposal before OPEC.   At another point, when asked if he thought OPEC would accept theoffer, he replied: ``We haven't done anything yet.''   Six OPEC oil ministers met with representatives of the non-OPECcountries on Wednesday to review the export-cutting plan. Theindependent producers envison reductions of 200,000 barrels dailyin their exports and about 700,000 barrels a day in OPEC's exports.   After their meeting the two groups said they shared a desire tosee stability in oil prices and found ``much common ground in theiranalysis'' of the world oil market situation.   They stopped short of saying they agreed on how price stabilitycould be achieved, but sought to stress the importance of themeeting between OPEC and rival producers.   ``It constitutes the beginning of a new stage of cooperationbetween a large number of oil-producing countries,'' the groupsstated.   The six non-OPEC countries involved are Mexico, China, Malaysia,Egypt, Angola and Oman. Colombia took part in the talks but said itwould not join in the proposed export cuts.</TEXT></DOC>
