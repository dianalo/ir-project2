The report, based on federal surveys, said that in 1966,education held a narrow lead over the physical sciences as the mostpopular field of doctoral-level study. Of the 18,239 doctoratesawarded by U.S. universities that year, 3,063, or 17 percent, werein education, compared to 3,045 in the physical sciences.   In 1986, education was still in the No. 1 spot, but by a muchwider margin. It accounted for 7,110, or 21 percent, of the 33,653Ph.D.s awarded. The physical sciences again were second with 3,551.   But education's share of doctorates peaked in 1977 at 7,960 andhas declined steadily since then as fewer men pursued the advanceddegree. Men outnumbered women four-to-one among the educationPh.D.s in 1966. Women took the lead in 1983 and outnumbered the menin 1986, 3,795 to 3,315.   The 7,110 education Ph.D.s in 1986 was the lowest since 1972.   The report, ``Profile of Education Doctorates: 1976 to 1986,''was written by the center's Susan T. Hill, P. Elaine Kroe andSummer D. Whitener.   Education administration and supervision was the most popularspecialty, accounting for 1,622 of the Ph.D.'s in 1986. Some 787were in curriculum and instruction, 609 in higher education, 323 ineducational psychology and 315 in counseling and personnel services.   A total of 1,141 of the Ph.D.s were in various subjects orteaching fields, with physical education, health and recreation themost popular (291), followed by reading education (134), musiceducation (94), trade and industrial education (86) and Englisheducation (79).   The report said 194 of the 438 doctoral-granting institutions inthe United States awarded education Ph.D.s in 1986. The top 10were: Temple University, 171; University of Pittsburgh, 165;Columbia University-Teachers College and Nova University, both 163;Vanderbilt University, 149; Michigan State University 139;University of Georgia, 129; University of Texas-Austin, 125;University of Maryland-College Park, 124; University ofMassachusetts-Amherst, 112.   Foreign students received 700, or nearly 10 percent of theeducation doctorates in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
