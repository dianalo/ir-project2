The chips, available in sizes to hold 256,000 charactersor one million characters of information, will do double dutyas random-access memory chips and read-only memory chips,which can't be erased by computer errors. The partitionableRAM chip uses software to protect or release sectors asneeded.</LP><TEXT>   The chips will be used in factory automation, medicaldiagnostic and other equipment that must pick up where theyleft off after computer failures. A leader infailure-resistant memory chips, Dallas-based DallasSemiconductor seven years ago introduced memory chips thatuse an internal power source for uninterruptible service. Thenew chips also incorporate the internal power source.</TEXT></DOC>
