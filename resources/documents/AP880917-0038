Heavy rain fell on this southernmost Texas city and wind guststo 62 mph were measured at the airport and to 65 mph at PortIsabel. Up to 5 inches of rain was forecast, along with tides 7 to11 feet above normal.   Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around Brownsville asGilbert made its way ashore, overturning cars and mobile homes andtearing the roofs from buildings. Some injuries but no deaths werereported.   Police in nearby Harlingen said the windows of 20 to 30 cars ina parking lot were shattered by high winds or a tornado. Low-lyingcoastal roads were closed by high water.   A Coast Guard helicopter rescued the crews of three fishingboats run aground in the storm-tossed Gulf of Mexico, plucking fivepeople from a 70-foot fishing boat and found the crew of its sisterboat beached near Port Isabel.   The Coast Guard also rescued a third missing boat and crew inMatagorda Bay. ``We're just full of happy endings today, which isgreat with a storm like this,'' said Petty Officer Bob Morehead.   At 11 p.m. CDT, the center of the storm was near latitude 24.6north and longitude 98.6 west, or about 115 miles southwest ofBrownsville. Its highest sustained winds had slackened to 105 mph.   Gilbert, which for a time earlier this week was the mostpowerful storm on record in the Western Hemisphere, weakenedsomewhat but remained a dangerous storm, responsible for at least70 deaths and billions of dollars in damage as it roared across theCaribbean and through the Gulf of Mexico.   The calm eye at the heart of the hurricane made landfall about120 miles south of Brownsville at 4:35 p.m. CDT, in Tamaulipasstate, said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at the National HurricaneCenter in Coral Gables, Fla.   It was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was expectedto follow that track through mid-day Saturday, before turninggradually to the northwest, forecasters said.   ``The rain was blowing sideways,'' said Ruth Wooddell, who choseto ride out the storm in her home Saturday.   By 11 p.m., hurricane warnings for the Texas coast from PortO'Connor to Brownsville were downgraded to a high wind warning, butcoastal flood warnings were posted for the entire Texas coast.   ``The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great. Rainfallas high as 10 to 15 inches _ maybe even 20 inches _ is expected,''Zimmer said.   Remnants of Gilbert should bring very heavy rains this weekendto Rio Grande valley of Texas before heading north up theMississippi River Valley as a ``huge rain-making machine,'' Zimmersaid.   Hurricane-force winds should end by early Saturday. By mid-week,the storm should be in lower Ohio River Valley. ``Gilbert will lastbe heard of as a rain storm somewhere in the Great Lakes,'' he said.   The eye passed over Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, two small Mexicanvillages a few miles north of La Pesca, which has a population ofabout 500, said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at the NationalHurricane Center.   The mayor of Soto la Marina, 20 miles inland from La Pesca, wascontacted by The Associated Press as the storm struck his town of8,000 residents.   Mayor Hinojosa Cortina said the town's situation Marina was``getting worse with every passing minute. There are very strongwinds. It's all dark. There is no electricity and no water. Treeshave been uprooted.''   Cortina said some residents had fled the town in advance of thehurricane but many remained. Other town officials said 3,000 peoplefrom fishing villages along the coast were given shelter in Soto laMarina.   Monterrey, an industrial city with a population of about 3million, is the closest major city that could be affected. It is210 miles northwest of La Pesca, but protected by the smallmountain range of the Sierra de Tamaulipas.   Zimmer said the range should break up circulation of hurricanewinds and accelerate drop in wind speed, which naturally occurswhen storm moves over land. But he also said very heavy rains couldcause flash floods and mudslides.   Thousands of people also evacuated in neighboring areas ofnortheastern Mexico, including the entire beach area of Matamoros,a city of 280,000 just across the border, which includes poshvacation homes, restaurants and small fishing villages, officialssaid.   Many streets in Matamoros were flooded and officials said about5,000 people fled their homes in low-lying coastal areas. Winds of35 mph, gusting as high as 57 mph, knocked out power to the city.   ``Up to now the damages are not considered very grave,'' saidJose Inez Gonzalez, a city spokesman. He said officials distributedcrackers and water to thousands of people in shelters and urgedthem to stay until the storm ended.   To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in YucatanState and 10,000 more were homeless in Campeche, on the west coastof the peninsula, the government news agency Notimex said.   Violent weather surrounding the hurricane spun off more than ahalf-dozen tornadoes over the Brownsville area Friday, blowing overat least two homes and slightly injuring one person. Gilbert'sinfluence extended far across the Gulf and thunderstorms that werepart of its circulation spawned tornadoes in Alabama.   The roof was ripped from a Brownsville apartment complex andwindows were blown out. Police in nearby Harlingen said the windowsof 20-30 cars in a parking lot were shattered by high wind or atornado.   Despite the danger of flying debris, Robert Rios, 16, wasskateboarding down Brownsville's International Boulevard when thestorm neared its peak.   ``There's a lot of movement and it's fun,'' Rios said. ``I knowit's dangerous. I've fallen down a couple of times but it's just athrill.''   Some 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in afour-county area of southern Texas around Brownsville, American RedCross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman said.   An estimated 25,000 people evacuated as a precaution in southernLouisiana, as did about 40 percent of the 65,000 residents of theisland city of Galveston, but most people in those two areas wereallowed to return home Friday when the storm's track seemed certainto avoid them.   Brownsville resembled a ghost town Friday, with many of its100,000 residents having fled to schools, auditoriums and churches.Electrical power was out in some areas and sporadic in others.   But city spokeswoman Pam Downing estimated at least 50 percentof Brownsville's residents live at or below the poverty line andcould not afford to leave.   ``Obviously, we have those that live in substandard housing andthey have no way of getting out of here,'' she said. ``And if theydo get out of town, the cost of supplies would be too much andtheir finances basically force them to stay here.''   Police fanned out in colonias _ where people live inmetal-roofed, plywood shacks _ to make certain residents had left.   ``We don't want to panic anybody but we wanted to tell them thatif they did not get out now, it would be very difficult to get outlater,'' police Sgt. Dean Poos said as officers went through aflood-prone area of town known as Southmost, about 20 miles fromthe Gulf along the Rio Grande.   Mayor Ygnacio Garza at mid-day halted police from warning peopleto leave.   Tornadoes and flooding by then made travel too dangerous, saidHidalgo County Sheriff's Department spokesman Rene Torres. ``Peopleare being advised to just stay where they're at and ride the stormthrough,'' he said.   Downing estimated only 20 percent of the residents had left town.   ``We didn't want to go anywhere but here anyway,'' RamonCardenas, 78, said while he and his invalid wife, Maria, waited outthe storm at a public shelter. ``Our house is pretty old. We lefteverything in there. If it falls, we know it doesn't have to govery far, but I don't know what we'll do if it is damaged.''   One Texas drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane. A3-year-old boy fell from his family's shrimp boat when they movedthe vessel for safe mooring, said Calhoun County Sheriff'sspokesman Rick Prush.   The Coast Guard rescued 16 people from three fishing boats, twonear Port Isabel and one in Matagorda Bay.   Gov. Bill Clements sent National Guard units to McAllen, Aliceand Corpus Christi.</TEXT></DOC>
