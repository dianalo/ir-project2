The staff proposed a $50,000 fine against the utility for alleged failures to comply with rules for &quot;maintenance, surveillance, operations, quality assurance and radiation protection.&quot; Niagara Mohawk has 30 days to pay the fine or contest the charges.    William Russell, regional administrator in the NRC's Philadelphia office, said the violations indicated &quot;underlying weaknesses in management control of activities&quot; at the plant near Oswego, N.Y.    The charges stemmed from complaints by a Niagara Mowhawk employee that the utility failed to resolve, according to NRC spokesman Joseph Fouchard. Mr. Russell said the incident indicates that the utility has an &quot;inadequate&quot; system for resolving employee concerns.    In a letter to Niagara Mohawk, the regional administrator also said the plant's problems &quot;demonstrate an apparent complacent attitude among certain members of your staff, which may have contributed to declining performance and an increase in the number of operational problems at unit 1.&quot;    &quot;Basically, these fines are for violations which were addressed in mid-1986,&quot; a spokesman for Syracuse, N.Y.-based Niagara Mohawk said. &quot;The issues raised (by the NRC) we did agree with, they were of concern to us, too.&quot;    But the spokesman declined to comment on how the company would respond to the NRC. He said Niagara Mohawk would issue a statement today.    Douglas Ellison, an instrument and control technician at the plant, has said he complained last April that shoddy couplings and improper procedures were used to connect power monitors in the reactor core to wires leading to gauges in the control room. He claimed his concerns were ignored and he was harassed by co-workers. Mr. Ellison has documented 13 other allegations of violations by the plant.    NRC inspections last August and September confirmed some of the allegations and found other infractions, according to the NRC's Mr. Fouchard.    Karl Abraham, a spokesman for the NRC's Philadelphia office, said he is barred by law from identifying who made the allegations that the NRC confirmed at the plant, but he said more than one person was involved. He also said the NRC's review of the plant would continue. &quot;This case is not closed,&quot; he said.    Separately, Niagara Mohawk said it plans a 5.5% reduction in its work force.    The utility said it hopes to cut its 11,000-member work force by about 600 by offering early retirement to 700 employees.    It said the cutback as well as other cost-cutting measures are being imposed in part because of a reduction in the utility's allowed return on equity, recently authorized by New York regulators. </TEXT></DOC>
