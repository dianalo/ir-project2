(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Carolina today banned hazardous wasteshipments from 32 states and Puerto Rico that have not beguncreating their own dumps.   ``As trucks that come from an area that's banned ... we're goingto turn the truck back and, if at all possible, escort them back tothe state line,'' said Bill Culler of the state Department of Healthand Environmental Control.   The ban applied to a commercial landfill operated here by GSXServices. It is one of only two commercial hazardous waste landfillsin the Southeast.   Most landfill customers had been notified of the ban, but thedepartment increased the number of inspectors monitoring thelandfill from three to 10 today to watch for unexpected loads frombanned states, Culler said.   ``It will have a tremendous impact on our business,'' GSX VicePresident Roger Davis said. ``We just think it's a good businessdecision not to challenge it.''   The ban, announced Tuesday, affects such heavy landfill users asFlorida and North Carolina.   It results from Gov. Carroll Campbell's Jan. 18 executive orderthat South Carolina would prohibit, beginning March 1, the disposalof waste from any state that refused to dispose of the waste itself.   ``We hope our actions will encourage other states to move towarddeveloping their own hazardous waste management programs,'' saidHartsill Truesdale, head of the state health department's hazardouswaste division.   ``It was both the failure of other states to aggressively addresstheir waste disposal problems and the growing imbalance in wastedisposal that prompted Governor Campbell to issue this executiveorder.''   The massive GSX landfill on the shore of Lake Marion annuallyaccepts 135,000 tons of hazardous waste, such as solvents, acids andother chemical garbage. About 70 percent comes from out of state.   The other hazardous waste landfill in the Southeast is in Emelle,Ala.   The governor's spokesman, Tucker Eskew, said he believedCampbell's message to other states would come across: ``If it's notgood enough for you, it's not good enough for us.''   Campbell has said that any state would have to remove disposalprohibitions before the ban could be lifted.   North Carolina responded to the ban with the introduction of abill Tuesday that renews that state's search for a hazardous wastetreatment plant, though it fails to specify when a site would bechosen.   South Carolina state Sen. Phil Leventis, a longtime landfillopponent, said other states should have working disposal sitesbefore being allowed to send South Carolina their waste.   ``Anybody that promises us that with a little revision of a lawthat their state is soon going to be handling its own hazardouswaste is simply telling us the check is in the mail,'' Leventis said.   The banned states shipped about 45 percent of the waste handledby the dump in 1987, according to the latest figures available.   In addition to Puerto Rico, Florida and North Carolina, thefollowing states are affected by the ban: Alaska, Arizona,California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington,West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.</TEXT></DOC>
