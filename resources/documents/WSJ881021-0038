Mr. Hunt's representatives, in federal court here yesterday, handed over a $17 million check to Minpeco S.A., the company that won the sweeping verdict last August. The payment relieves Lamar Hunt of any responsibility for the damages award to Minpeco.    Judge Morris E. Lasker said, however, that there would have to be a separate hearing to discuss whether the Minpeco verdict could be used against Mr. Hunt in the two pending class action suits involving other plaintiffs.    These suits, on behalf of 17,000 investors who claim losses due to the alleged silver conspiracy, involve about $500 million in claims against the three Hunt brothers and numerous other defendants including several brokerage firms. If the judge were to bar the verdict from being used against Mr. Hunt in these cases, then the conspiracy charges and all other allegations against him would have to be proven all over again.    Herbert Deutsch, the New York attorney representing the investors, firmly objected in court yesterday to a comprehensive dismissal of the verdict against Mr. Hunt. This would &quot;wipe from history six and a half months of trial, thereby making it a nullity,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think the judgment should be just stripped from the record.&quot;    Mr. Hunt would not comment on this issue. His response to yesterday's hearing was limited to a prepared statement, in which he said, &quot;In spite of the fact that the claims against me were totally unwarranted, because of the uncertainties of litigation and the substantial costs associated with further proceedings, I made the business decision to put the litigation behind me so that I can spend my time pursuing positive business interests.&quot;    On Aug. 20, a jury affirmed Minpeco's allegations in its $150.6 million lawsuit that Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt, Lamar Hunt and two other defendants committed fraud and violated commodity and antitrust laws. The jury found that the defendants had conspired to corner the world silver markets of 1979-80. The jury also found that the defendants, except for Lamar Hunt, had violated civil sections of the federal racketeering law.    Mark Cymrot, an attorney at the Washington law firm Cole Corette andamp; Abrutyn representing Minpeco, said, &quot;This is only the beginning of our efforts to collect the full judgment from the Hunt brothers and other defendants.&quot;    Today, Minpeco is expected to file a motion in the Dallas bankruptcy court to lift a stay that protects Nelson Bunker Hunt and Herbert Hunt from all pending litigation against them, including the Minpeco verdict. The two Hunt brothers filed for personal bankruptcy last month in part to thwart Minpeco's attorneys from collecting the award. </TEXT></DOC>
