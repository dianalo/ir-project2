The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140miles inland from Matamoros.   At least 10 police officers were swept away while on a rescuemission around midnight, a judicial police officer said. Severalbuses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and morewere feared drowned.   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said earlytoday it had been raining for more than 24 hours.   A trailer truck also slid into the Santa Catarina river in thedriving rain and its two occupants were missing, the localnewspaper El Norte said.   Recreational areas with soccer fields, basketball courts, tenniscourts and jogging trails have been built along the river in thelast few years.   Monterrey is a major northern industrial center and the capitalof Nuevo Leon state. The Santa Catarina river crosses Monterrey.   The storm slammed into Mexico for the second time in a weekFriday afternoon. The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mphwinds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in asparsely populated area 120 miles south of Brownsville, Texas,weather reports said.   Although the storm had lost much of its muscle, it caused floodsand mudslides after it barreled into Mexico. Earlier in the week,Gilbert killed at least 29 and left 300,000 people homeless in theYucatan Peninsula.   The hurricane has killed at least 109 people, including one inTexas, 39 in Mexico, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in theDominican Republic and eight in Honduras. However, the death tollis expected to rise.   In Matamoros just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, thestorm felled trees, downed power lines and flattened dozens of tinshack homes on the evacuated beachfront. About 5,000 people wereevacuated inland.   Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around Brownsville.Much of the Yucatan Peninsula remained without communications andsupplies today.   At 9 a.m. EDT today, Gilbert's center was located near latitude25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest ofBrownsville and 40 miles south of Monterrey, said the NationalHurricane Center in Florida.   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and thestorm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours.   The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying thestorm with up to 20 inches locally. Flash floods were likely, itsaid.   The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and wasexpected to follow that track through midday today before turninggradually to the northwest, forecasters said.   In Matamoros, officials said the worst part of the stormappeared to have passed. ``Up to now the damages are not consideredvery grave,'' said Jose Inez Gonzalez, a Matamoros governmentspokesman.   Officials distributed crackers and water to thousands of peoplein shelters and rged them to stay put until the storm ended.   Gilbert hit Soto la Marina, a town of 8,000 people 20 milesinland from La Pesca on late Friday, its mayor told The AssociatedPress by telephone.   ``There is considerable material damage to the town. It is stillraining very hard,'' said Mayor Ruben Hinojosa Cortina. ``We willjust have to stay in and wait until tomorrow to survey thesituation.''   Hinojosa Cortina said about 3,000 refugees from La Pesca weresheltered in Soto la Marina but other coastal residents had notbeen evacuated or decided to ride out the storm.   The Sierra de Tamaulipas, a small mountain range betweenMonterrey and the coast, should blunt the hurricane's strength,said Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center.   Zimmer expected the last of hurricane-force winds today. But hepredicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into coolermountain air, possibly causing flash floods and mudslides.   The Mexican armed forces began emergency flights Friday of food,medicines and water to Cancun, Cozumel and other disaster sites inthe Yucatan.   In many locations, hurricane victims were without food, drinkingwater, electrical power, gasoline and communications sinceWednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
