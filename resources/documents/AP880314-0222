Dissidents were planning their own demonstration following theofficial event scheduled for Tuesday morning.   Haraszti, a writer, told The Associated Press police picked himup at his house and handcuffed and beat him before taking him to apolice station in Budapest's 5th district where he was releasedafter being held for two hours.   He said he was warned that he and a colleague, Tibor Philipp,would be held responsible for any ``anti-system moves'' ordisturbances if the dissidents hold a demonstration.   Police also searched the home of Philipp, who is associated withthe underground Inconnu cultural group, according to Haraszti.   Over the past two weeks, police raided the homes of at leastseven dissidents including sociologist Ottilia Solt, writer GyoergyGado and Gabor Demzsky, who runs the largest underground publishingoperation in communist Hungary, according to dissident sources.   They said police seized hundreds of journals and documents.   Haraszti said he also was criticized by the police for takingpart in a recent two-day conference in Bonn, organized by the WestGerman Social Democrats to discuss detente, and for making astatement on Radio Free Europe. In the broadcast statement, hedenied the official claim that police in the earlier house raidsfound leaflets opposing the consititution and legal order.   He said only books and underground papers were confiscated.   Last Friday, several official publications referred to the housesearches and said proceedings were under way against six people,but they did not report the type of proceedings.   Saturday's edition of the Communist Party daily Nepszabadsagsaid the police announcement of the raids showed that ``the organsresponsible for public order had managed to stop irresponsiblepeople from disturbing the March 15 holiday.''   It said that in addition to the official event, ``an opportunityhas been offered for other types of commemorations if they are notof dubious intent and do not disturb the peace.   ``It is impermissible that this celebration be used foradventurist goals.''</TEXT></DOC>
