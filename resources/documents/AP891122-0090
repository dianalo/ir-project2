He had been president only 17 days.   A police spokesman said Mouawad died instantly in the blast,which came minutes after the president held a reception markingLebanon's Independence Day. The spokesman refused to say why policeinitially reported Mouawad was not hurt in the blast.   At least 23 other people were reported killed, including 10 ofMouawad's bodyguards.   Col. Mohammed Khashab, a police bomb squad official, said thebomb was hidden in a small shop and detonated by remote control. Hedenied earlier reports that a car, which was set ablaze by theblast, had contained the explosives.   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The bomb wentoff at 1:45 p.m. on Bustros Boulevard in the Sanayeh district. Itwas so powerful it hurled the president's bulletproof Mercedeslimousine several yards off the street.   Mouawad, 64, a Maronite Catholic, had long advocatedChristian-Moslem reconciliation in his country. He was elected Nov.5 at a special Parliament session as part of an ArabLeague-sponsored peace plan aimed at ending Lebanon's 14-year-oldcivil war.   He was sworn in the same day, despite strong objections by theChristian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, who opposed the plan. Theparliamentary session was moved to Syrian-controlled north Lebanonafter Aoun threatened to shell it.   Mouawad's top aides, Prime Minister-designate Salim Hoss, aSunni Moslem, and Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a ShiiteMoslem, also were in the 10-car convoy, in the vehicle behind thepresident's. Police said they were not hurt.   ``It is a national disaster,'' Hoss said in a radio address tothe nation, 2{ hours after the explosion. ``President Rene Mouawadwas assassinated by the hand of treason,'' he said, his voicebreaking with emotion.   Syria's state-run media issued a similar statement today,condemning the assassination and blaming it on ``the hand ofbetrayal and treason.''   President Bush denounced the assassination as ``disgraceful,terroristic'' and pledged continued U.S. assistance for efforts toend Lebanon's civil war. ``It is a disgraceful performance and iscondemned by the United States of America,'' Bush said.   ``However, we must not let this brutal killing stand in the wayof trying to bring peace to the troubled corner of the world. Iwould like to offer the help of America...to bring these killers tojustice,'' Bush said.   In other early reaction, an Israeli official described themurder as a defeat for Syria. In Paris, National Assembly deputiesheld a moment of silence.   A statement from Hoss's office said Hoss and Husseini hadconvened in ``crisis talks'' to prepare for a quick Parliamentsession to elect a successor to Mouawad.   The statement stressed that the leaders were trying to avoid apolitical vacuum that would undermine the peace plan, which wasapproved last month.   Aoun objected to the plan because it did not include a timetablefor the withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon. Hedenounced Mouawad as a Syrian puppet.   The Syrians were deployed in Lebanon in 1976 under apeacekeeping mandate to quell civil war fighting. Aoun said theyabrogated the mandate by siding with the Moslems in the civil war,and he has vowed to drive them out.   On Sept. 14, 1982, President-elect Bashir Gemayel, a Maronite,was assassinated.   His brother, Amin Gemayel, became president and served until histerm ran out in September 1988. From that time until Mouawad'selection, Lebanon had been without a president because Parliamentwas unable to agree on a president.   The police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in linewith standing regulations, said 23 people, including 10 ofMouawad's bodyguards, were also killed today. He identified thedead bodyguards as six Syrian army soldiers and four Lebanesesoldiers.   The spokesman also said 36 people, including many civilians,were injured.   Mouawad and his aides had just left Government House in Sanayeh,where they were hosts to foreign diplomats, parliamentarians andother dignitaries at a reception marking Independence Day.   Lebanon gained independence from France on Nov. 22, 1943.   Hundreds of Syrian soldiers and Lebanese army troops andpolicemen converged on the scene. The Syrians fired their riflesand several rocket-propelled grenades in the air to clear the wayfor ambulances. Most of the victims were quickly picked up bycivilian cars and rushed to hospitals before ambulances arrived.   The streets emptied of civilians, who apparently feared anoutbreak of shelling duels between Aoun's troops and allied Syrianand Moslem forces.   Voice of Lebanon radio broadcast appeals for blood donations.   The Independence Day celebration in Sanayeh was markedlylow-key, but all ambassadors accredited to Lebanon attended,underscoring their countries' recognition of Mouawad as head ofstate.   In east Beirut, about 1,000 soldiers of Aoun's mainly Christianunits held a symbolic parade at the military academy in thegarrison town of Fayadiyeh.   The French, British, Italian, Turkish and Chinese militaryattaches attended the celebration. Seven helicopters hoveredoverhead as three aging Hawker Hunter jets fighters made a singlelow run over the parade grounds.   Brig. Gen. Issam Abu Jamra, one of the three officers in Aoun'sbreakway military Cabinet, presided over the parade.   Aoun reportedly fears an attempt on his life and seldom venturesout of the bunker under the devastated presidential palace in theBeirut suburb of Baabda.   Mouawad is survived by a wife, Nayla Koury, and two children _Michel, 17, and Rima, 22.   Before being elected president, Mouawad had been a member of the99-seat Parliament since he was elected to represent his homeregion of Zghorta in 1957 at the age of 32. His assassinationleaves only 72 surviving members of the Parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
