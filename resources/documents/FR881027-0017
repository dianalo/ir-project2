The Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis describingthe options considered in developing this rule and the impact of implementingthe proposed rule is available on request from the above office.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule is issued in conformity withExecutive Order 12291, Federal Regulations. This action will not (1) havean annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) result ina major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investmentor productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Therefore, this rule has been determined to be ``not major.'' This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1976) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.853, Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program. For thereasons set forth in the final rule related Notice to 7 CFR Part 3015,Subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985), this program is excluded fromthe scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultationwith State and local officials. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 1.7 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Departmentof Agriculture, Clearance Office, OIRM, Room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250;and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Managementand Budget, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On December 21, 1987, Section 313, Cushion of Credit Payments Program,was added to the RE Act. Section 313 establishes a Rural Economic DevelopmentSubaccount and authorizes the Administrator of REA to utilize funds inthis subaccount to provide zero interest loans or grants to RE Act borrowersfor the purpose of promoting rural economic development and job creationprojects. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>On April 7, 1988, REA published an advance notice of proposed rulemakingin an effort to obtain public comments on all aspects of this new program.REA received a total of 54 written comments and several comments over thetelephone. Nine organizations in the propane industry opposed the new programwhile forty-five organizations comprised of RE Act borrowers, electricand telephone trade organizations, and several economic development organizationssupported the new program.Organizations in the propane industry opposed the program on principleeven though it is established by law. Many stated that they objected totheir competition, the electric utilities, getting taxpayer money at zeropercent or as a grant. Other propane industry organizations said they favoredrural economic development but did not feel it should be controlled byelectric utilities. One organization said REA had fulfilled its mission.Another believed a problem in rural America is loans that have gone bad.Throughout these nine comments was a general belief that the rural economicdevelopment program would put the propane industry at a competitive disadvantagewith electric utilities. Despite the propane industry's adamant opposition,REA must proceed with implementing this program since it is establishedby law. Many of the organizations commenting in favor of the program supplied specificsuggestions that were incorporated into the proposed rule. These commentswill be addressed in the following paragraphs which discuss major provisionsof the proposed rule. The section of the proposed rule setting forth REA's policy stresses thatborrowers are encouraged to promote rural economic development that isbased on sound economic and financial analysis. Many organizations mentionedthe importance of sound analysis to the long-term success of rural development.A large number of organizations addressed the issue of eligibility of borrowersto receive zero interest loans or grants and, in particular, whether ornot eligibility should be dependent on making cushion of credit payments.Most organizations said a borrower should not have to make cushion of creditpayments (also called advance payments) that lead to credits in the RuralEconomic Development Subaccount in order to be eligible for funds underthis program. Several organizations took the opposite position, sayingthat it would only be fair to establish some connection between eligibilityand cushion of credit payments. One organization suggested that a borrowershould receive grant or zero interest loan funds in an amount equal tothe amount of funds generated as a result of its cushion of credit payments.The proposed rule establishes no requirement that a borrower must makecushion of credit payments to be eligible for funds under this program.The only restriction is that a borrower that is not current in its paymentson All RE Act financing or is in bankruptcy proceedings is not eligible.REA received many suggestions on the particular type of rural economicdevelopment project this program should help finance. The proposed ruledoes not attempt to define specific types of projects that are eligiblefor funds but rather provides for the Administrator to exercise broad discretionin selecting projects. To provide guidance to borrowers applying for loanor grant funds, the rule contains a list of important selection factorsthe Administrator will consider. Many of the selection factors were mentioned in the comments. There wasstrong support for encouraging the use of supplemental or matching fundsfrom other sources to leverage the loan or grant funds provided under thisprogram. This is included as a selection factor. Some other selection factorssuggested were a comparison of the unemployment rates to a national orstate level, a comparison of jobs to be created to the amount of the investmentand support for projects that improve marketable skills. Since REA believesthat the nature of this program leads naturally to encouraging demonstrationprojects, we have included a commitment to being a demonstration projectas a factor. Also, REA and many organizations which commented believe thatlocal community support and planning will be crucial to the success ofthis program. Accordingly, REA will consider endorsements and sponsorshipto be an important indicator of the potential for the ultimate successof the project. Several other factors will be considered such as the locationof the project, organizational characteristics, probability of long-termsuccess and finally whether or not a borrower has made cushion of creditpayments. Whether or not a borrower has made cushion of credit payments does notdetermine eligibility in any manner; however, the Administrator is requiredto encourage borrowers to make voluntary payments. REA believes it is appropriateto at least weigh in a borrower's commitment to generating funds for theprogram along with all the other selection factors. REA did consider including an objective ranking procedure based on assigninga given number of points for each of the selection factors. One organizationsuggested instituting this type of ranking procedure as a way to ensureequitable treatment of all applicants. REA invites your comments on thispoint. Several organizations suggested that the Administrator select the mixtureof zero interest loans and grants to make out of available funds basedon a preference for zero interest loans over grants. They argued that theprincipal of zero interest loans is repaid into the Subaccount and canbe recycled into new projects. REA supports this argument. The rule doesnot preclude making a certain amount of grants but rather indicates a preferencefor zero interest loans. REA has established the minimum dollar amount of a zero interest loan orgrant at $10,000 mainly for administrative purposes. No maximum level isproposed although REA did consider establishing a maximum amount basedon a percentage of the total amount available in the Subaccount. REA believesthe Administrator should have a considerable amount of discretion in determiningthe maximum amount available for a particular project. The pre-proposal notice asked for suggestions on establishing the termsfor zero interest loans to the borrower. The most common suggestions werethat REA recognize the start-up nature of many projects and allow for flexibility.The proposed rule reflects these suggestions. The security for the zero interest loan will be based on necessary legalagreements between REA and the borrower as well as a requirement that REAapprove all agreements between the borrower and the project. The proposedrule was deliberately written to allow flexibility in devising the securityand controls necessary for the long-term success of the program. The proposed rule contains a section stating that a rural economic developmentproject must not result primarily in the transfer of existing employmentor business activity from one area to another. It is not the intentionof this provision to be restrictive to rural development but rather toprevent criticism of the program. REA believes, for example, that thisprogram should not be used to finance business moves that take jobs awayfrom those currently employed elsewhere. REA recognizes that this typeof determination can be difficult at times which is the reason the languagestresses that is must not result primarily in such a transfer. Several organizations commented on the method of processing loan and grantapplications. REA has attempted to minimize the amount of paperwork andforms borrowers need to submit. We have established both a preapplicationand application stage in the process. It obviously makes sense for a borrowerto only go through the extra effort of an application if its project hasbeen selected. One organization recommended a periodic selection process.We have incorporated this recommendation by establishing four applicationperiods throughout the year. This will provide both timely action on anpreapplication and equitable treatment to all borrowers. Many organizations stressed the need for streamlined procedures for thisprogram and our regulations reflect this desire. This loan and grant programis a Federal program subject to various laws, regulations and executiveorders. REA wishes to point out that there is a considerable differencebetween the requirements placed on borrowers receiving grants versus therequirements placed on borrowers receiving zero interest loans under thisprogram. The differences result from the standardized Federal regulationscovering grant programs that apply as well to the grant portion of thisprogram. The Federal regulations on grants are quite extensive. Most requirementsare found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) under 7 CFR Part 3015and 7 CFR Part 3016. The proposed rule contains several references to theseregulations. Zero interest loans are not covered by these government-wideregulations. The zero interest loan program will follow, to the extentpossible, a streamlined version of the current RE Act loan procedures andrequirements. A required difference in handling grants and zero interestloans is mainly evident in two sections, one is the section on the disbursementof funds and the other is the section on review and other requirementsof borrowers. The proposed rule requires the borrower to monitor the project. REA believesclose coordination between the borrower and the project is essential forthe success of this program. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1709 </ITAG>Community development, Grant programs, Loan programs, Rural areas.
