Sometimes, big, fat, $7 million-dollar mistakes.    Alpheus L. Ellis, a director of NCNB Corp. and, until recently, its largest shareholder, sold too soon when he unloaded a huge block of the regional banking company's stock last month for $43 million.    Mr. Ellis sold 928,230 shares for $46.32 a share on July 5, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But since he sold, NCNB stock has climbed steadily, closing yesterday at $54.25, up 75 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. If Mr. Ellis had waited just four weeks, he would have made an extra $7.4 million.    Waiting a month would have meant more money for NCNB, too. That's because the stock Mr. Ellis sold was part of an 8.5 million-share secondary offering.    &quot;In retrospect, it would have been nice to have more dollars,&quot; said Rusty Page, NCNB's senior vice president and head of investor relations. But he said the sales price was more than two times the company's per-share book value {assets minus liabilities}. Pricing the shares higher &quot;would have been kind of greedy, and we're not that way,&quot; said Mr. Page.    Mr. Ellis couldn't be reached for comment. But don't fret too much about the Tarpon Springs, Fla., banker. The shares he sold, which were indirectly owned, represented only a tiny fraction of his NCNB holdings. Mr. Ellis acquired the stock in 1984 as part of a deal to sell his bank-holding company, Ellis Banking Corp., to NCNB. He retains 6,903,274 shares, or a 7.2% stake.    ---   FEATHERING THE NEST EGG: The four founders of Bonneville Pacific Corp. sold 383,144 shares of company stock to an employee stock ownership plan at less than the market price.    A review of the Salt Lake City power-company's incentive and compensation package disclosed &quot;we didn't have a very meaningful retirement plan,&quot; said Robert L. Wood, one of the founders and the company's chief financial officer.    To rectify the situation, an ESOP was set up for the firm's 103 employees. The shares, which represent a 2.9% stake in Bonneville, were sold on June 14 and June 30 for $7.83 each. The market price on those days was $10.375 and $11.75, respectively. Bonneville Pacific shares closed yesterday at $10.50, down 25 cents in national over-the-counter trading.    Mr. Wood said he is somewhat concerned the retirement plan isn't diversified enough. But employees, as they near retirement age, will be able to &quot;diversify their individual accounts&quot; into other holdings, he said.    In addition, SEC filings show that late last month two vice presidents of the company sold smaller stakes, 3,000 and 300 shares, respectively.    ---   UNCOUPLING: At Trinity Industries Inc., a Dallas-based maker of structural steel products and railroad cars, two insiders recently sold chunks of their stock.    On June 23, Jess T. Hay, a Trinity director and chairman of Lomas andamp; Nettleton Financial Corp., sold 17,500 shares, or more than three-quarters of his holding, SEC filings show. Most of the stock was sold at $42 a share, for proceeds of about $735,000. The stock closed yesterday at $44.50, up $1 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Mr. Hay couldn't be reached for comment.    On July 17, Richard G. Brown, a senior vice president, sold 5,817 shares for $241,405, or $41.50 a share. That was a bit more than half his stock, but Mr. Brown said he still has &quot;lots of stock options left.&quot; He added, &quot;I'm 65 years old and I'm reorganizing my finances.&quot;    ---   HARD DOLLARS, SOFTWARE: Matthew Griffin, the Egghead Inc. vice president who accumulated 100,000 shares {5,000 of them indirectly} July 7 to July 18 for more than $1.1 million, has been with the software retailer only since February.    Previously he had spent most of his career as a developer of high-rise buildings on the West Coast. About a year ago, he and two colleagues formed a closely held company to engage in &quot;buying operating companies and restructuring them,&quot; but they abandoned that plan to spend full time as the new management of Egghead.    One of their main priorities, Mr. Griffin says, is &quot;declaring war on shrink.&quot; He wants to reduce the 2.6% of sales that are now lost through inventory mysteriously disappearing.    As for his big purchase, Mr. Griffin calls it &quot;partly an investment and partly a signal to the community and to employees that we believe in what we're doing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
