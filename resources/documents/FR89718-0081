The Funds are open-end management investment companies registered underthe 1940 Act. IDS Financial Corporation acts as investment adviser to theFunds and IDS Financial Services Inc. acts as distributor.2. The Prior Order permits Strategy Fund to assess a contingent deferredsales load (``CDSL'') on redemptions of its shares. The CDSL is waivedwith respect to redemptions (a) following the death of a shareholder, and(2) from an Individual Retirement Account or other tax-qualified retirementplan. The Prior Order also permits certain exchanges of shares among theFunds on a basis other than their net asset value per share at the timeof exchange.3. Applicants now seek an amendment to the Prior Order to permit the StrategyFund to waive the CDSL, in addition to those waivers already permittedunder the Prior Order, for any redemption made by: (a) A director, officeror employee of the Fund, IDS or its subsidiaries or IDS financial planners,(b) participants in an employee payroll deduction program, (c) participantsin a qualified employee benefit plan or (d) a trust company, bank trustdepartment or similar institution holding shares in a fiduciary, agency,advisory, custodial or similar capacity, subject to minimum requirements.4. Applicants also seek an amendment to the Prior Order to permit the Fundsthat charge a front-end sales load (the ``FESC Funds'') and Cash ManagementFund to assess and, in certain circumstances, to waive a deferred salesload. Shares of the FESC Funds are sold with a five percent front-end salesload. Presently the FESC Funds waive the front-end sales load for certaingroups, including participants in employee benefits plans qualified underSection 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (``qualified plans'') which alsomeet certain minimum requirements. However Applicants propose to chargethese sharesholders and qualified plan participants who are shareholdersin the Cash Management Fund a deferred sales load on certain redemptionsfrom the Funds. Applicants contend that if Cash Management Fund had nodeferred sales load, investors in the FESC Funds could avoid the deferredsales load by exchanging into Cash Management Fund prior to redeeming theirshares. In no event will the deferred sales load exceed four percent ofthe purchase payments made by the shareholder. The proposed deferred loadwill decrease to two percent for plans with $1 million or more in assetsor 200 or more participants and will be eliminated for plans with $3 millionor more in assets or 500 or more participants. 5. Applicants believe that waiver of the front-end sales load will increasesales in the qualified plan market. Applicants do not wish to impose adeferred sales load on all purchases by qualified plan participants, butinstead wish to recover distribution costs only when shareholders who havenot paid a sales load redeem prior to retirement, in circumstances unrelatedto death, disability, loans or hardship withdrawals. 6. Therefore, the proposed deferred sales load will not be assessed (a)on the death or disability of an investor, (b) in connection with lump-sumor other distributions following retirement or attaining age 59\1/2\, (c)with respect to loans or hardship withdrawals, or (d) in connection withthe combination of any Fund with another investment company by a mergeror acquisition of assets. 7. No Fund will be charged with any revenue lost as a result of the proposedwaivers. 8. Applicants submit that the deferred sales load, its waiver, and theadditional waivers of the CDSL are appropriate in the public interest andconsistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intendedby the policy and provision of the 1940 Act. Applicants believe that theproposal will not harm the Funds or shareholders or unfairly discriminateamong shareholders or purchasers. 9. Applicants will implement the deferred sales load and its waiver, andthe waiver of the CDSC in a manner consistent with the requirements ofRule 22d-1 applicable to sales loads. <T3>Condition: </T3>Applicants state that their proposal will be implementedin accordance with the following condition:<ITAG tagnum="21">The terms of the deferred sales load and its implementation will complywith Rule 6c-10 as currently proposed and as adopted or modified in thefuture.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
