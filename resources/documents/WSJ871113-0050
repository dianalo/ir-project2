Ross Johnson, president and chief executive officer, said.    In response to questions following his speech to the New York Society of Security Analysts, Mr. Johnson said: &quot;This baby is starting from the ground up and is large scale. You don't grow smokeless cigarettes like carrots in a garden.&quot; He described the new cigarettes, which the company bills as the &quot;world's cleanest,&quot; as &quot;very engineered.&quot;    Mr. Johnson said he expects the cigarettes to go into test market in the second quarter of 1988.    In September, RJR unveiled plans to develop a cigarette that would produce little smoke, no ash, no odor and no tar. At the time, analysts generally applauded the product's potential, but after the meeting yesterday, some expressed surprise that it is so costly to the company's earnings.    &quot;Clearly we were expecting some negative impact from its production and marketing, but $125 million exceeded those estimates,&quot; said David A. Goldman, analyst at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc. In Mr. Goldman's view, the expenditure suggests not only that the company plans a &quot;huge&quot; marketing program for the new product, but that &quot;Mr. Johnson has other problems that he is blaming on this one product.&quot;    A number of analysts said the cost of the product introduction had caused them to reduce their 1988 per-share earnings estimates for RJR to around $5.70 from $6. In 1987, they expect RJR to earn $1.2 billion, or $4.75 a share, compared with $962 million, or $3.83 a share, in 1986.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, RJR closed at $50 a share, up 62.5 cents.    Other analysts maintained, however, that costs of bringing the smokeless product to market are within reason. &quot;I fully expected this kind of outlay,&quot; said Roy Burry of Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;This is the biggest revolution in smoking since the filter cigarette.&quot;    Added Marc Cohen, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.: &quot;To RJR, 30 cents (a share) isn't a lot compared to the opportunity&quot; the product presents.    In prepared remarks, Mr. Johnson said fourth-quarter domestic tobacco shipments will fall 4% to 5%. But he said retail-sales patterns wouldn't change, and he predicted that the Atlanta-based tobacco and foods company would achieve a 20% increase in earnings per share in 1988.    Separately, Mr. Johnson confirmed that RJR has been looking at the possibility of acquiring Beatrice Cos. But he said that Beatrice would like to be acquired &quot;in one big block,&quot; while RJR is interested in purchasing only certain pieces. Mr. Johnson declined to disclose which ones, saying: &quot;They are all interesting. They are all pretty good. But they cost too much.&quot;    As previously reported, Donald P. Kelly, Beatrice's chairman, has said he hopes to complete the sale of the Chicago-based food concern by February. </TEXT></DOC>
