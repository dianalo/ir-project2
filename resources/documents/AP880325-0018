One was the exemption of spy satellites from treatyrestrictions. The other was that U.S. and Soviet negotiators make asupreme effort to define space-based testing and deployment.   The Soviets seemed taken with the satellite proposal, butsharpening definitions of space tests and space deployments couldbe very difficult. There's always been a question whethertechnology sent into space is part of a permissible test or is atricky step toward an illicit anti-missile deployment.   In any event, with the Moscow summit meeting only nine weeksaway, the outlook for completing the new U.S.-Soviet treaty is notbright.   The biggest problem is verification _ making sure cutbacks arecarried out.   Two types of long-range weapons are especially hard to monitor.One is the land-based mobile missile. The other is the sea-launchedcruise.   Experts assisting Secretary of State George P. Shultz and SovietForeign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze were unable to resolve theproblem during three days of talks here.   And yet, the two sides apparently still intend to try to includethe weapons in the accord with all bombers, submarines and missileshaving a range in excess of 3,000 miles.   The Soviets proposed a joint experiment next month to seewhether monitors could determine if an American ship was carryingnuclear-tipped cruise missiles.   The United States rejected the proposal as unlikely to solve thedetection problem.   On another front, a little headway was made.   The U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, probably the biggestobstacle to the treaty, and the Soviet space defense program willbe dealt with separately by the negotiators.   The Soviets claim the U.S. program, known popularly as StarWars, violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. They havethreatened at various times to hold up a new accord to reducestrategic nuclear weapons unless the U.S. program to develop adefense against ballistic missile were curbed.   That ``linkage'' has not been removed.   Shultz told reporters Wednesday night ``the two things move inparallel.'' In other words, the Soviets are retaining the rightsuddenly to halt progress on arms reductions unless the UnitedStates slows down SDI.   ``Both sides have worked hard and some progress has beenrealized in a number of areas, but much more needs to be done,''the two sides said in a communique winding up three days of talks.   Shultz and Shevardnadze will meet again in Moscow on April 21.Meanwhile, U.S. and Soviet negotiators will keep trying to agree onthree drafts for the treaty. One deals with the elimination ofweapons, another with verifying the cutbacks and the third with thesize and location of U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenals.   Before flying home, Shevardnadze called the rejected Sovietproposal to verify sea-launched cruise missiles a breakthrough inverification. He said the Soviets had similar ideas for monitoringmobile intercontinental ballistic missiles and air-launched cruises.   ``I hope that at the April round we will find solutions for anumber of these problems,'' the Soviet foreign minister said.   But he was not all that optimistic about concluding a treatybefore the June 29 summit meeting.   ``I can't guarantee that a treaty will be signed in Moscow, butit is a possibility, given enough effort,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid has covered six U.S.-Sovietsummits for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
