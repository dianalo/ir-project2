Frank Nesbitt, who is accused of delivering unauthorizedinformation to Soviet agents, requested citizenship when he was inMoscow as a tourist in September, said Foreign Ministry spokesmanYuri Gremitskikh.   He was turned down because of ``suspicion of connections withthe criminal underworld,'' Gremitskikh said. He did not elaborate.   Nesbitt, 44, a former military communications officer, wasarrested in a McLean, Va. hotel earlier this month and ordered heldwithout bail Oct. 19. A federal grand jury will hear thegovernment's case against him.   The FBI says Nesbitt received $2,000 for classifiedcommunications intelligence information he gave the Soviets duringhis 10-day stay in Moscow, and was promised up to $100,000 more forfuture work.   Nesbitt's lawyer, Gregory English, said last week his clientintended no harm to the United States. He said Nesbitt passed ononly information he believed to be unclassified and had proposed tothe FBI that he become a double agent.   English also said Nesbitt ``wanted to have some excitement inhis life.''</TEXT></DOC>
