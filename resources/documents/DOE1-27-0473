Thermal neutronswere more effective than X-rays in induction of endogenous virus as wellas in killing of the cells. However, when measured as a function of cellkilling, both radiations had similar efficiency of induction. The RBEsof thermal neutrons alone were calculated on the assumption that thecontribution of contaminating {gamma}-rays was additive. It was 4.2 forthe killing effect and 4-5 for virus induction.</TEXT></DOC>
