(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who falsely claimedresponsibility for a fatal traffic accident because his son hadbeen driving without insurance has been sentenced to jail alongwith the son.   Ronald Haw, 49, a Culver City engineer, was sentenced to oneyear in county jail Friday and three years' probation by OrangeCounty Superior Court Judge James K. Turner.   Haw was convicted of conspiracy and a misdemeanor charge offiling false information with a police officer concerning theaccident, which killed a 17-year-old bicyclist.   Haw's 25-year-old son, Gary, was sentenced to two years in stateprison for his role in the Sept. 8, 1987, accident. He wasconvicted in August of felony hit-and-run driving and conspiracy.   Gary Haw was not insured to drive his father's turbochargedPorsche. He admitted at trial that he lied to authorities about whowas driving at the time so the insurance would cover the damage.   The younger Haw testified that he had not seen the bicyclist.   He said that after the accident he called his father and askedhim to come to the scene. He told police his father was driving buthad gone for help after the crash and probably had becomedisoriented and lost.   The judge ordered Gary Haw taken into custody upon sentencing,expressing concern that he might flee, said Deputy DistrictAttorney Pat Donahue.   The prosecutor said the younger Haw deserved prison because,among other things, ``He lied about the death of a boy, and also heencouraged others to participate in this charade he planned.''   Donahue said he also sought jail time for the father ``becauseof the callous attitude he showed during the trial, the nature ofthe lie and the fact that he was lying about the death of a boy forinsurance reasons.''</TEXT></DOC>
