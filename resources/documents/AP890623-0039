New Jersey sends 55 percent of its trash out of the state,including 1.5 million tons a year to Ohio, a state whose landfillslast year doubled their intake of imported garbage.   Sahli said Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste proposes a $40-a-ton tax ongarbage shipped long distances.   ``Such a tax would act as an incentive to states to take care oftheir own waste disposal needs and not create ... potentialenvironmental problems in communities located hundreds of milesaway,'' he said.   The money could be used to encourage recycling, develop marketsfor recycled products and to increase Environmental ProtectionAgency funding for research into better ways of handling solid waste.   The garbage shipped to Ohio alone would generate more than $100million if taxed at the suggested $40-a-ton rate, he said.   Ohio last year took in 2.4 million tons of out-of-state waste, upfrom 1.2 million tons in 1987.   ``We simply do not have adequate disposal capacity to become theEast Coast's dumping ground,'' Sahli told the House Energy andCommerce transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee.   The Natural Resources Defense Council said 15,000 landfills haveclosed in the past 10 years, leaving about 5,000 nationwide. All ofFlorida's landfills must close within 10 years because of threats togroundwater, the environmental group testified.   Paul Templet, secretary of the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality, said that state has 40 landfills, down from800 in operation in 1980.   ``Solid waste management in Louisiana has reached crisisproportions,'' said Templet, who suggested a national recyclingprogram and strict landfill guidelines.   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said he would introduce legislationthat would treat trash the same way the government treats low-levelradioactive waste. His bill would force states to develop regionalcompacts to deal with the garbage problem collectively.   Donald Deieso, assistant commissioner of the New JerseyDepartment of Environmental Protection, said the state hopes to endall trash exports by 1992. He suggested Congress order every stateto become able to handle its own garbage by a certain date.</TEXT></DOC>
