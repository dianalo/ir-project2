It would please me if they'd takethe money from just one of those missiles and put it intoserving homeless people.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The reaction at the Brothers' Keeper may be a minorityview among black voters as a whole, but it isn't unusual. Anew nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that amajority of black voters support President Bush and the U.S.decision to go to war in the Persian Gulf, for most of thereasons that white voters do. Yet a much higher percentage ofblack voters are skeptical of the war effort than are whitevoters. While 78% of white voters surveyed this week said thepresident had waited long enough before using military force,only 52% of black voters agreed; twice as many blacks aswhites -- 39% vs. 19% -- thought Mr. Bush should have givensanctions more time to work.   Black voters' approval of President Bush has gone up sincethe attack, but doesn't begin to reach the level of whitesupport. In a December Journal/NBC poll, 60% of whites andonly 26% of blacks approved of the job Mr. Bush was doing aspresident; this week, a whopping 81% of whites and 48% ofblacks approved of Mr. Bush's performance.   There are many reasons why a higher percentage of blacksseems to oppose the war. Few prominent black Americans havepublicly endorsed the war, while many have come out againstit, from Coretta Scott King, whose husband preachednon-violence, to Chicago mayoral candidate Danny Davis toformer Gary Mayor Richard Hatcher, who says, &quot;The irony isnot lost upon blacks that just a few months ago the U.S. wassaying it was broke and that it couldn't afford to doanything.&quot;   In some cases, the war has brought to the surfacelong-felt anger and frustration that have been sharpened bysome civil rights setbacks and social-service cutbacks. Also,many fear that blacks will suffer a disproportionate share ofany casualties in the Gulf war.   And, in other cases, blacks are frustrated that blackveterans have fought for ideals abroad that they feel werenot fully realized at home. &quot;Black men and women have been inevery war this country's ever fought,&quot; says Ralph Cooper, aVietnam veteran and executive director of the Veterans'Benefits Clearinghouse, a black veterans' counseling centerin Boston. &quot;These young Americans come back and find out thatthey're still a nigger in America.&quot;   Many blacks who do not support the war offer the samereasons as whites who don't, such as wondering whetherAmerica is shedding blood only to make the world safe for$1-a-gallon gasoline. &quot;You can dress it up a little bit, butwhat it comes down to is the almighty dollar,&quot; says GerdaSteele, host of a radio talk show on black issues inPasadena, Calif.   Views of the war in the black community run the gamut, ofcourse. Many blacks, like Celes King III, a Los Angeles bailbondsman, World War II veteran and brigadier general inCalifornia's state military reserves, fully support the war.&quot;Hussein has to be stopped,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't like war. Idon't like to see young men killed. If, however, it does cometo the reality of war, blacks should do our part.&quot;   And the split in the black community doesn't fit neatlyinto age groups or socioeconomic categories. While somesuccessful black businessmen support the war, for instance,others oppose it. Thomas Hightower, a businessman in Burbank,Calif., says: &quot;It's not about civil rights, but about oil.And look who's at the heart of the decision-making process:wealthy white males who are sending minorities to theirdeath.&quot;   A National Opinion Research Center survey reported in theWashington Times this week said 51% of whites thought blackswere not as patriotic as other Americans. Even some blackslike Juan Walker, a businessman and community worker inInglewood, Calif., worry that opposition to the war will beinterpreted as un-American. He says a successful resolutionof the war will underscore the capabilities of black soldiersfrom privates to Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powelland adds: &quot;The idea of going against the country isunpatriotic, and it's the wrong move for the blackcommunity.&quot;   That charge infuriates many blacks, especially those whooppose the war. They despair that many Americans confusemilitarism with patriotism. Says Adrienna Shropshire, who isactive in a group against the war at the University ofSouthern California: &quot;How can we be more patriotic than bydoing what we're doing?&quot; Todd Deloney, president of the BlackStudent Union at Indiana University Northwest, says, &quot;I loveAmerica. I like to think I'm one of the most patriotic peoplearound.&quot; But he feels &quot;we provide cannon fodder for theirguns.&quot;   While pollsters have not focused on the Hispaniccommunity, it appears that opposition to the war there, whilenot as strong, may be coalescing, and for many of the samereasons. &quot;We are asked to fight, but when we come back fromwars, the doors are closed,&quot; says Carlos Rodriguez of NewYork, who is a veteran. &quot;When I returned from Vietnam, ittook me so long to get job. You should see how they looked atVietnam veterans. It was an unpopular war, and I wasdark-skinned.&quot;   Both among Hispanics and blacks, the overwhelming reasonfor opposition to the war-cited again and again in interviewswith Wall Street Journal reporters -- was the guns-and-butterissue.   In the South Bronx: Democratic Rep. Jose E. Serrano sayshe couldn't vote to spend billions to restore &quot;a prince andhis 50 cousins in a little kingdom&quot; instead of &quot;taking careof the poor in my district.&quot;   In Atlanta: &quot;We say we don't have adequate federal fundingfor programs like education and housing and food and healthinsurance. But we find ways to justify spending $30 billionfor this technological warfare,&quot; says James H. Costen,president of the Interdenominational Theological Center.   In Gary: &quot;We dealt with this crisis with decisivedetermination, but you don't see that when it comes torebuilding the infrastructure of our cities or taking care ofhealth and education,&quot; says Mayor Thomas V. Barnes, who spent26 years in the Army Reserves and on Tuesday said goodbye tohis 32-year-old son, whose Reserve unit was called up. Garyhas been trying unsuccessfully to get federal funds for stormsewers for 15 years, and can afford to keep only 19 of its 50city buses running.   In Boston: James Owens, a first sergeant in the ArmyReserves who is on standby to report to Saudi Arabia,supports the war but says it is &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; thatthe U.S. would spend billions on it while there ishomelessness and poverty in the U.S. Besides, he adds,&quot;Things aren't going to change on the home front. You'reasked to go defend your country and then you come back andstill can't get a job.&quot;   That may be true even for career black soldiers, accordingto Charles Moskos, a military sociologist at NorthwesternUniversity. He says that while he hasn't conducted a study,anecdotal evidence indicates that &quot;it's very rare for aretired black general to get a lucrative private-sector job.&quot;   He says that of an estimated 20 to 30 retired blackgenerals, &quot;I know of only one black general who has receiveda prestigious or well-paying private-sector job. If you're awhite general, it's a lot easier.&quot; He says the same goes forretired black colonels, of which there are &quot;several hundred.&quot;(Former Gary Mayor Hatcher notes that among the many retiredmilitary personnel hired as &quot;consultants&quot; by the media aboutthe Gulf crisis, he has seen no blacks.)   Many blacks who oppose the war contrast U.S. actions inthe Gulf and in South Africa. Eugene Wiley, who runs an artsbusiness in Atlanta, says: &quot;Most of the people who live inKuwait are simply foreigners who work for the Kuwaitis. TheKuwaitis themselves are arrogant and wealthy and takeadvantage of others. The idea that we're `liberating' them iscomical. The U.S. has been aware for 30 or 40 years of what'sbeen going on in South Africa -- scores of people beingkilled, denial of freedom of the press and other basicrights. But we haven't gone in to `liberate' the 25 millionSouth Africans who are oppressed by six million whites.&quot;   And, Mr. Wiley adds pointedly: &quot;Our blood will bespilled,&quot; referring to the disproportionate number of blacksin the military.   That is a theme often cited. Although the military now isall-volunteer, blacks ask how voluntary military servicereally is for young people with few other job opportunities.&quot;You have a lot of blacks who are in the Persian Gulf notbecause they signed up to fight for their country, butbecause they were looking for a job, to improve their lot,&quot;says Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who represents Watts andother areas of Los Angeles. And in a comment echoed by manyblacks, she adds: &quot;They were escaping the mean streets of theinner cities, gangs and drugs.&quot; Actually, the military ismore solidly middle-class than generally perceived, and 95%of Army personnel are high school graduates.   Edwin Dorn, an Brookings Institution analyst andspecialist on the issue of race, class and the military, saysblacks' skepticism is &quot;a residue of the Vietnam experience.There's a widespread perception in the black community thatblacks did more than their fair share of fighting and dying.That perception happens to be wrong, but it happens to bewidespread, so it informs people's attitudes about themilitary.&quot;   In 1965 and 1966, blacks accounted for more than 16% ofcombat deaths (including more than 20% of the Army deaths).That prompted an outcry from Martin Luther King Jr.: &quot;We weretaking the black young men who had been crippled by oursociety and sending them . . . to guarantee liberties inSoutheast Asia which they had not found in southwestGeorgia.&quot; Criticism eventually led to a fairer draft, and bythe end of the war black soldiers accounted for 12% of U.S.fatalities.   Today, black Americans, who make up about 12% of thepopulation, are a disproportionate share of the military,especially in Desert Storm. According to Pentagon figures,blacks account for 25% of the force, and all minorities for32%. One of every 25 working eligible-age (18-44) white malesis in the service, but one out of every 12 working blackmales of that age, Mr. Dorn says. So black Americans are morelikely to know someone who is in the Gulf, and &quot;there's akind of individual or closer identification with fighting anddying,&quot; he says.   Blacks stress that while they may oppose U.S. policy inthe Gulf, they fully support the soldiers, sailors and airmenthemselves. As Mrs. King puts it, she is &quot;against the war,not the warriors.&quot; At a senior citizens' Christmas party inAtlanta, Democratic Rep. John Lewis, who opposes the war, wasconfronted by a constituent, retired Army Lt. Col. HolmanEdmond Jr., a decorated veteran of Vietnam who, like Rep.Lewis, is black. Col. Edmond, who has two sons in the Army,both doctors, told Rep. Lewis that with troops in the field,the time for debate was over.   Col. Edmond, in an interview later, said blacks should be,and are, proud to serve. &quot;Every generation, I feel, shouldcontribute their share to the freedom of this country. We'rein a society that is racist, that's true,&quot; he says. &quot;But thisis my theory: If you don't pay your taxes and they don't pickup your garbage, you can't fuss. But if you pay your fees andthey don't pick up your garbage, you can raise hell about it.You've got to put yourself in a position where you can be inthe debate.&quot;   Col. Edmond isn't the only one upset about protests.Garlan Lanier of Gary, who served a year in Vietnam as amedic and was an Army recruiter for six years, calls theprotesters &quot;hypocrites.&quot; He is disturbed that people who havefound the energy to protest the war never marched againstdrugs and all the other problems associated with poverty.&quot;They're not out protesting homelessness or drugs,&quot; he says.&quot;They should be trying to take care of things at home.&quot;   Hispanics have been slower to mobilize anti-war sentimentthan blacks, but a few groups are getting organized. AndyHernandez, head of the Southwest Voter Research Institute, aSan Antonio-based center that develops information onHispanic voter attitudes, is just beginning to collect data,but he believes that Hispanics will probably be somewhere inthe middle between white and black attitudes.   He senses a split between many prominent Hispanics whooppose the war and the war's grass-roots supporters, and hewonders whether some Hispanics &quot;feel compelled to demonstratetheir patriotism because they're always being told thatthey're not really Americans.&quot;   &quot;Some of our people are uncomfortable with the peacemovement,&quot; says Carlos Melendrez, project director of theLatino Issues Forum in San Francisco. &quot;There's a veryconservative element in the Latino community. To them, thingslike actively protesting the war just aren't done.&quot; Moreover,he says, &quot;you're already behind the eight ball when whitesbelieve you're less patriotic.&quot;   The differences of opinion on the war extend to the young.At the Boys and Girls Club in Gary, five boys gather todiscuss the war with a reporter. They range in age from 13 to16. Only one says he'd join the military now. But there is astrong undercurrent that, as blacks, they've taken enoughabuse. Antiunn Walton, 13, having watched the news, asks,&quot;Why are they letting the black folks fight and the whitesfly the airplanes?&quot; Then this exchange:   &quot;It's really a white man's world,&quot; says Antiunn. &quot;Blackpeople get treated worse than white people. You know thereain't no black man who wants to go to war.&quot;   &quot;Man, I'd go defend my country,&quot; says Michael Rogers, 15.   &quot;Man,&quot; shoots back Antiunn, &quot;what's this country done foryou lately?&quot;   ---   Contributing to this article were Suzanne Alexander inBoston, Alex Kotlowitz in Chicago, Michel McQueen inWashington, Sonia L.
