In east Beirut, right-wing Christian militias clashed overnightin a resurgence of a power struggle within the Christian community.Police said one person was killed and four were wounded.   Police said 15 people were killed and 42 wounded today as thepro-Iranian Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal fought one oftheir heaviest duels yet in Beirut's southern slums. The casualtiesraised the toll since the Shiite fighting broke out May 6 to 294killed and 993 wounded.   Police said Hezbollah was inching toward Amal's last strongholdin the 16-square-mile enclave where most of the 18 foreign hostagesare believed held.   There has been no confirmed news on the fate of the hostagessince the fighting began. Lebanese reports have said the captives,who include nine Americans, have been moved several times.   Also today, a statement signed by Islamic Jihad, which claims tohold some hostages, said the captives would be killed if theirgovernments did not initiate direct negotiations with thekidnappers.   There was no way to verify the authenticity of the statement.Islamic Jihad has said it would always send a picture of a hostagewith its statements, but no photograph accompanied the statementleft at the home of a reporter today.   The statement said: ``The Islamic Jihad Organization advisescountries interested in the hostages' problem to speed up directnegotiations for their safety, because the application of pressuresas well as the current plans and recipes on the ground targetingthe Islamic fervency will lead to liquidating all the hostages andthrowing their dead corpses out.''   One daily, Ad-Diyar, which is published in Christian eastBeirut, reported today that two American captives are being held atthe Iranian Embassy. The report, which did not name the hostages,could not be verified independently.   Iran last week denied that foreign hostages were being held inits embassy.   A police spokesman said Amal militiamen withdrew today frompositions in the Ghobeiry district under a fierce barrage ofhowitzer and mortar fire.   Amal fighters withdrew to the district of Shiyah at the northernedge of south Beirut, said the spokesman, who cannot be named understanding regulations.   Hezbollah controlled the southern and western flanks of Shiyahand its gunners were pounding Amal's threatened supply lines at thenorthern edge of the area, he said.   ``Hezbollah has managed to achieve some gains across theGhobeiry positions,'' an Amal communique said.   It said Hezbollah gunners blasted Shiyah and the surroundingarea with 1,500 shells in a nine-hour barrage.   Meanwhile, a Hezbollah statement accused Amal of``indiscriminately bombarding'' areas under the party's control insouth Beirut.   T-54 tanks and multi-barrel rocket launchers mounted on trucksat Amal positions in Shiyah poured gunfire into Hezbollah'sterritory. Hezbollah fired back with 155mm howitzers and 120mmmortars.   Police said both sides also traded grenades in hit-and-runforays.   The escalation followed Syria's rejection of a proposal by Iranfor the deployment of a joint peacekeeping force in the slums.Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, Syria's military intelligence chief for theBeirut area, said the Iranian proposal was ``out of the question.''   Such an involvement would strengthen Iran's influence in Lebanonwhile Syria is seeking to eliminate sectarian rivalries and end thecountry's 13-year-old civil war.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss called Monday for Syrianmilitary intervention ``without delay'' to end the Shiite militiafighting.   Syria has had about 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armoredvehicles massed around the area's narrow alleyways and cement-blockshanties for the last 10 days. The buildup came after Hezbollahseized 90 percent of the urban battleground in the first week offighting.   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in its 7{-year-old war with Iraq.But Hezbollah's move to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites hasstrained that alliance.   The east Beirut fighting pitted President Amin Gemayel'sPhalange Party irregulars against fighters of the Lebanese Forces,the Christians' main militia.   Police said both sides used machine guns and rocket-propelledgrenades in the duels, which raged through the night. The fightingbegan after Lebanese Forces ambushers shot and wounded NabilKahhaleh, Phalangist commander for the Sin el-Fil district ofBeirut.</TEXT></DOC>
