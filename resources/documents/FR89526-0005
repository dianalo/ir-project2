The Notice invited comments from all interested parties. The Commissionreceived comments from one national organization representing individualswith disabilities and two agencies of state government that administerprograms for such individuals. The Commission has carefully consideredthese comments and has made revisions to the rule and to the discussionof the rule below, in response. The revisions to the rule modify the definitionof a ``qualified individual with handicaps'' and provide greater detailon procedures for filing and processing complaints of discrimination. Thediscussion below summarizes the comments that were received and the changesmade in response to these comments.The rule and the comments are available for public inspection at the Commission'slibrary at 1801 ``L'' Street NW., Washington, DC between the hours of 9:00am and 5:30 pm Monday through Friday. Copies of the rule are availableon tape for those with impaired vision from the Commission's Handicap ProgramManager, (202) 663-4392; TDD (202) 663-4399. Section 504 requires that regulations that apply to the programs and activitiesof Federal executive agencies be submitted to the appropriate authorizingcommittees of Congress and that such regulations take effect no earlierthan the thirtieth day after they have been so submitted. Concurrent withthe publication of this final rule the Commission is submitting this regulationto the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the House Committeeon Education and Labor, pursuant to this requirement. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The purpose of this rule is to provide for the enforcement of section 504of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), as it appliesto programs and activities conducted by the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission. As amended by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, andDevelopmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978 (Sec. 119, Pub. L. No. 95-602,92 Stat. 2982), and the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 (Pub. L.No. 99-506, 100 Stat. 1810), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">No otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States,* * * shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participationin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination underany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or underany program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the UnitedStates Postal Service. The head of each such agency shall promulgate suchregulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendments to this sectionmade by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental DisabilitiesAct of 1978.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">29 U.S.C. 794.</ITAG>The substantive nondiscrimination obligations of the Commission, as setforth in this rule, are identical, for the most part, to those establishedby Federal regulations for programs or activities receiving Federal financialassistance. <T3>See </T3>28 CFR Part 41 (section 504 coordination regulation for federallyassisted programs). This general parallelism is in accord with the intentexpressed by supporters of the 1978 amendment in floor debate, includingits sponsor, Rep. James M. Jeffords, that the Federal Government shouldhave the same section 504 obligations as recipients of Federal financialassistance. 124 Cong. Rec. 13,901 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Jeffords); 124Cong. Rec. E2668, E2670 (daily ed. May 17, 1978) <T3>Id.;</T3> 124 Cong. Rec. 13,897 (remarks of Rep. Brademas); <T3>Id. </T3>at 38,552 (remarks of Rep. Sarasin). There are, however, some language differences between this rule and theFederal Government's section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs.These changes are based on the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3>v. <T3>Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979), and the subsequent circuit court decisionsinterpreting <T3>Davis </T3>and section 504. <T3>See Dopico </T3>v. <T3>Goldschmidt, </T3>687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association </T3>v. <T3>Lewis, </T3>655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981) <T3>(APTA);</T3> <T3>see also Rhode Island Handicapped Action Committee </T3>v. <T3>Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, </T3>718 F.2d 490 (1st Cir.1983). These language differences are also supported by the decision of the SupremeCourt in <T3>Alexander </T3>v. <T3>Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985), where the Court held that the regulationsfor federally assisted programs did not require a recipient to modify itsdurational limitation on Medicaid coverage of inpatient hospital care forhandicapped persons. Clarifying its <T3>Davis </T3>decision, the Court explained that section 504 requiresonly ``reasonable'' modifications, <T3>Id. </T3>at 300, and explicitly noted that ``[t]he regulations implementingsection 504 for federally assisted programs are consistent with the viewthat <T3>reasonable adjustments </T3>in the nature of the benefit offered mustat times be made to assure meaningful access'' (<T3>Id. </T3>at 301, n.21) (emphasis added). Incorporation of these changes, therefore, makes this regulation implementingsection 504 for federally conducted programs consistent with the FederalGovernment's regulations implementing section 504 for federally assistedprograms as they have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. Many of thesefederally assisted regulations were issued prior to the interpretationsof section 504 by the courts: the Supreme Court in <T3>Davis, </T3>subsequent lower court cases interpreting <T3>Davis, </T3>and the Supreme Court in <T3>Alexander; </T3>therefore their language does not reflect the interpretationof section 504 provided by the Supreme Court and by the various circuitcourts. Of course, these federally assisted regulations must be interpretedto reflect the holdings of the Federal judiciary. Hence the Commissionbelieves that there are no significant differences between this proposedrule for federally conducted programs and the Federal Government's interpretationof section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs. This regulation has been reviewed by the Department of Justice. It is anadaptation of a prototype prepared by the Department of Justice under ExecutiveOrder 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298) and distributed toExecutive agencies. It has also been reviewed by the Commission under ExecutiveOrder 12067 (43 FR 28967, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). It is not a major rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 (46FR 13193, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp., p. 127) and, therefore, a regulatory impactanalysis has not been prepared. This regulation does not have an impact on small entities. It is not, therefore,subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). <ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis </ITAG>Section 1615.101 Purpose Section 1615.101 states the purpose of the rule, which is to effectuatesection 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and DevelopmentalDisabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programsor activities conducted by Executive agencies or the United States PostalService.   Section 1615.102 ApplicationThe regulation applies to all programs or activities conducted by the Commission.Under this section, a federally conducted program or activity is, in simpleterms, anything the Commission does. Aside from employment, there are twomajor categories of federally conducted programs or activities coveredby this regulation: those involving general public contact as part of ongoingagency operations and those directly administered by the Commission forprogram beneficiaries and participants. Activities in the first part includecommunication with the public (telephone contacts, office walk-ins, orinterviews) and the public's use of the Commission's facilities. Activitiesin the second category include programs that provide Federal services orbenefits.Section 1615.103 Definitions``Assistant Attorney General.'' ``Assistant Attorney General'' refers tothe Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, United States Departmentof Justice.``Auxiliary aids.'' ``Auxiliary aids'' means services or devices that enablepersons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equalopportunity to participate in and enjoy the benefits of the agency's programsor activities. The definition provides examples of commonly used auxiliaryaids. Although auxiliary aids are required explicitly only by andSection;1615.160(a)(1), they may also be necessary to meet other requirements ofthis part. The regulatory definition of ``auxiliary aids'' has been amendedto include examples of aids for persons who are impaired in their abilityto reach or grasp objects. Although aids for such persons were clearlyintended to be included within the scope of the definition, the proposedrule only provided examples of aids for visually and hearing-impaired persons.Two commentors requested that we add other specified aids to those listedin the regulation for persons with impaired hearing. We do not think itis necessary to do so. The aids listed in the regulation are examples onlyand are not intended to be all-inclusive; the regulation refers to ``similarservices and devices.'' The Commission has not specified many other aidsthat would be appropriate for persons with other types of disabilities.We have added language to the regulation stating that the examples providedare not intended to be exclusive either as to the persons entitled to suchaids or the type of aids that may be required.``Commission.'' For purposes of this regulation ``Commission'' means theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission.``Complete complaint.'' The definition of ``complete complaint'' enablesthe Commission to determine the beginning of its obligation to investigatea complaint (<T3>see</T3> andSection; 1615.170(h)). The definition is necessary becausethe 180 day period for the Commission's investigation begins when it receivesa complete complaint. A commentor expressed concern that this definition,requiring a complainant to provide details on the nature and date of analleged violation when filing a complaint, is too restrictive and may leadto delays or EEOC inaction on valid complaints. Another commentor madea similar point, in requesting revisions to andSection; 1615.170. These commentsreflect a misunderstanding of the procedures that the Commission routinelyfollows to assure that complaints contain needed information. Section 1615.170of the proposed rule provided for correction of technically incompletecomplaints. However, to assure that the public fully understands the Commission'sprocedures, we have expanded andSection; 1615.170, as described below, tofurther clarify this process.``Facility.'' The definition of ``facility'' is similar to that in thesection 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs 29CFR 41.3(f), except that the term ``rolling stock or other conveyances''has been added and the phrase ``or interest in such property'' has beendeleted to clarify its coverage. The phrase, ``or interest in such property,''is deleted because the term ``facility,'' as used in this regulation, refersto structures and not to intangible property rights. It should, however,be noted that the regulation applies to all programs and activities conductedby the Commission regardless of whether the facility in which they areconducted is owned, leased, or used on some other basis by the Commission.The term ``facility'' is used in andSection;andSection; 1615.149, 1615.150and 1615.170(f).``Individual with handicaps.'' The definition of ``individual with handicaps''is identical to the definition of ``handicapped person'' appearing in thesection 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28CFR 41.31). Although section 103(d) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendmentsof 1986 changed the statutory term ``handicapped individual'' to ``individualwith handicaps,'' the legislative history of this amendment indicates thatno substantive change was intended. Thus, although the term has been changedin this regulation to be consistent with the statute as amended, the definitionis unchanged. In particular, although the term as revised refers to ``handicaps''in the plural, it does not exclude persons who have only one handicap.A commentor requested that we revise the definition to include a personwho has a ``physical, sensory or mental impairment,'' because deafnessis a sensory impairment that should not be lumped under the category ofphysical impairment. We have not made this revision because the Commission'sregulation repeats the statutory definition of an ``individual with handicaps.''``Qualified individual with handicaps.'' Paragraph (1) of the definitionof ``qualified individual with handicaps'' is a revised version of thedefinition of ``qualified handicapped person'' appearing in the section504 coordinatioin regulation for federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.32(b)).The Commission has amended the definition of ``qualified individual withhandicaps'' that appeared in the proposed rule to better reflect the natureof its programs and activities and to clarify its obligation to make modificationsthat will enable individuals with handicaps to participate in these programsand activities. The Commission has deleted subsection (1) of the definitionthat appeared in the proposed rule, which applied to programs and activities(except employment) under which a person is ``required to perform servicesor reach a level of accomplishment.'' On reconsideration, the Commissionhas determined that this part of the definition, which it had adopted froma prototype regulation drafted by the Department of Justice, is unnecessaryin its rule, because the Commission does not conduct programs or activitiesof this nature, other than employment.Subsection (2) of the proposed rule, which applied to all other programsand activities (except employment), has been redesignated (1) and amendedin response to concerns expressed by commentors. The commentors' majorconcern was that the definition of ``qualified individual with handicaps''in the proposed rule might allow the Commission to disqualify an individualwithout initial consideration of its obligation to provide modificationsor aids that would allow the individual to participate in a program oractivity.To ensure that this does not occur, the Commission was urged to incorporatethe requirement to make such modifications in this definition. The Commissionbelieved that the proposed rule did require it to make needed modificationsto enable individuals with handicaps to participate in its programs, andhad stated this specifically in the preamble to the rule. However, to avoidany possibility of a misconception such as that reflected by the commentors,we have revised the definition to make these obligations more explicitin the rule itself. As revised, the definition states that a qualifiedindividual with handicaps, with respect to any program other than employment,is ``an individual with handicaps who, with or without modifications oraids required by this part, meets the essential eligibility requirementsfor participation in, or receipt of benefits from, that program or activity.''The revision makes clear that determining whether a person is qualifiedis a two step process, which includes, where necessary, the provision ofauxiliary aids or program modifications as set out in andSection; 1615.130,andSection; 1615.150 and andSection; 1615.160 of the rule. Sections 1615.150and 1615.160 also reflect recent Supreme Court rulings indicating limitsto such obligations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.Paragraph (2) of the definition provides that, for purposes of employment,``qualified individual with handicaps'' is defined in 29 CFR 1613.702(f),which is made applicable to this part by andSection; 1615.140. Nothing inthis part changes existing regulations applicable to employment.``Section 504.'' This definition makes clear that, as used in this regulation,``section 504'' applies only to programs or activities conducted by theCommission and not to programs or activities to which it provides Federalfinancial assistance.Section 1615.110 Self-evaluationThe Commission shall conduct a self-evaluation of its compliance with section504 within one year of the effective date of this regulation. The self-evaluationrequirement is present in the existing section 504 coordination regulationfor programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR41.5(b)(2)). Experience has demonstrated the self-evaluation process tobe a valuable means of establishing a working relationship with individualswith handicaps that promotes both effective and efficient implementationof section 504.Individuals and groups with information to offer the agency concerningits self-evaluation study may contact the Commission's Handicap ProgramManager, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 1801 ``L'' Street NW.,Washington, DC 20507, (202) 663-4392, TDD (202) 663-4399.Section 1615.111 NoticeSection 1615.111 requires the Commission to disseminate sufficient informationto employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other interestedpersons to apprise them of rights and protections afforded by section 504and this regulation. Methods of providing this information include, forexample, the publication of information in handbooks, manuals, and pamphletsthat are distributed to the public to describe the Commission's programsand activities; the display of informative posters in service centers andother public places; or the broadcast of information by television or radio.A commentor requested revision of the first sentence of this section tostate that the Commission will ``effectively apprise'' persons of the protectionsof the regulation. The Commission considers this modification to be unnecessary.It is committed under the regulation and by terms of this section to assurethat individuals with handicaps are aware of their rights for access toits programs.Section 1615.130 General prohibitions against discriminationSection 1615.130 is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the section504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving Federalfinancial assistance (28 CFR 41.51).Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. Theremaining paragraphs in andSection; 1615.130 establish the general principlesfor analyzing whether any particular action of the Commission violatesthis mandate. These principles serve as the analytical foundation for theremaining sections of the regulation. Whenever the Commission has violateda provision in any of the subsequent sections, it has also violated oneof the general prohibitions found in andSection; 1615.130. When there isno applicable subsequent provision, the general prohibitions stated inthis section apply.Paragraph (b) prohibits the denial of equal opportunities for individualswith handicaps to participate in or benefit from Commission programs aswell as overt denial of equal treatment of individuals with handicaps.The agency may not refuse to provide an individual with handicaps withan equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from its programs simplybecause the person is handicapped. Such blatantly exclusionary practicesoften result from the use of irrebuttable presumptions that absolutelyexclude certain classes of disabled persons (e.g., individuals with epilepsy,hearing-impairments, or heart ailments) from participation in programsor activities without regard to an individual's actual ability to participate.Exclusion of an individual with handicaps from a program or activity basedon stereotyped characterizations of persons with his or her handicap isprohibited. Use of an irrebuttable presumption is permissible only whenin all cases a physical condition by its very nature would prevent an individualfrom meeting the essential eligibility requirements for participation inthe activity in question.Section 504, however, prohibits more than just exclusionary practices.As the Supreme Court recognized in <T3>Alexander</T3>, in enacting section 504, Congress intended to reachsome conduct, such as the maintenance of architectural barriers, that havea discriminatory effect upon individuals with handicaps. 464 U.S. at 297.It is not enough to admit persons in wheelchairs to a program if the facilitiesin which the program is conducted are inaccessible. Paragraph (b)(1)(iii),therefore, requires that the opportunity to participate or benefit affordedto an individual with handicaps be as effective as that afforded to others.The later sections on program accessibility (andSection;andSection; 1615.149-1615.151)and communications (andSection; 1615.160) are specific applications of thisprinciple.Paragraph (d) mandates that the Commission administer its programs andactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualifiedindividuals with handicaps. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) permits the agency todevelop separate or different aids, benefits, or services only when necessaryto provide individuals with handicaps with an equal opportunity to participatein or benefit from the agency's programs or activities. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv)requires that different or separate aids, benefits or services be providedonly when necessary to ensure that the aids, benefits, or services areas effective as those provided to others. Even when separate or differentaids, benefits, or services would be more effective, paragraph (b)(2) providesthat a qualified individual with handicaps still has the right to chooseto participate in the program that is not designed to accommodate individualswith handicaps.Paragraph (b)(1)(v) prohibits the Commission from denying a qualified individualwith handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of a planningor advisory board.Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the Commission from limiting a qualifiedindividual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage,or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, or service.Paragraph (b)(3) prohibits the Commission from utilizing criteria or methodsof administration that deny individuals with handicaps access to the agency'sprograms or activities. The phrase ``criteria or methods of administration''refers to official written agency policies and the actual practices ofthe agency. This paragraph prohibits explicit denials of opportunitiesto benefit from Commission programs due to handicap. It also prohibitsnonessential policies and practices that are neutral on their face, butthat operate to deny individuals with handicaps an effective opportunityto participate.Paragraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in andSection;1615.130(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction of newfacilities or existing facilities to be used by the Commission. Paragraph(b)(4) does not apply to construction of additional buildings at an existingsite.Paragraph (b)(5) prohibits the Commission, in the selection of procurementcontractors, from using criteria that subject qualified individuals withhandicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap.Paragraph (c) provides that programs conducted pursuant to a Federal statuteor Executive order that are designed to benefit only individuals with handicapsor a given class of individuals with handicaps may be limited to thoseindividuals.Paragraph (d), discussed above, provides that the agency must administerprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to theneeds of qualified individuals with handicaps, i.e. in a setting that enablesindividuals with handicaps to interact with nonhandicapped persons to thefullest extent possible.A commentor requested the Commission to reinstate a provision of the regulationsfor federally assisted programs that was omitted from these regulations.The provision prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance fromproviding ``significant assistance'' to an organization that discriminates.Such a provision would be inappropriate in this regulation that appliesto the Commission's federally conducted programs.Section 1615.140 Employment Section 1615.140 prohibits discrimination onthe basis of handicap in employment.Courts have held that section 504, as amended in 1978, covers the employmentpractices of Executive agencies. <T3>Gardner </T3>v. <T3>Morris, </T3>752 F.2d 1271, 1277 (8th Cir. 1985); <T3>Smith </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service, </T3>742 F.2d 257, 259-260 (6th Cir. 1984); <T3>Prewitt </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service, </T3>662 F.2d 292, 302-04 (5th Cir. 1981); <T3>Contra, McGuiness </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service, </T3>744 F.2d 1318, 1220-21 (7th Cir. 1984); <T3>Boyd </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service, </T3>752 F.2d 410, 413-14 (9th Cir. 1985). Courts uniformly have held that in order to give effect to section 501of the Rehabilitation Act, which covers Federal employment, the administrativeprocedures of section 501 must be followed in processing complaints ofemployment discrimination under section 504. <T3>Morgan </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service, </T3>798 F.2d 1161, (8th Cir. 1986); <T3>Smith, </T3>742 F.2d at 262; <T3>Prewitt, </T3>662 F.2d at 304. Accordingly, andSection; 1615.140 (Employment)of this rule adopts the definitions, requirements and procedures of section501 as established in regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC) at 29 CFR Part 1613. In addition to this section, andSection; 1615.170(b)(Compliance Procedures) of this regulation specifies that the Commissionwill use the existing EEOC procedures to resolve allegations of employmentdiscrimination. Responsibility for coordinating enforcement of Federallaws prohibiting discrimination in employment is assigned to the EEOC byExecutive Order 12067 (43 FR 28967, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). Under thisauthority, the EEOC establishes government-wide standards on nondiscriminationin employment on the basis of handicap. Section 1615.149 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited Section 1615.149 states the general nondiscrimination principle underlyingthe program accessibility requirements of andSection;andSection; 1615.150 and1615.151. Section 1615.150 Program accessibility: Existing facilities This regulation adopts the program accessibility concept found in the existingsection 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receivingFederal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57), with certain modifications.Thus, andSection; 1615.150 requires that the agency's program or activity,when viewed in its entirety, be readily accessible to and usable by individualswith handicaps. However, andSection; 1615.150, unlike 28 CFR 41.56-41.57,places explicit limits on the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility(andSection; 1615.150 (a)(2)). The regulation also makes clear that the Commissionis not necessarily required to make each of its existing facilities accessible(andSection; 1615.150(a)(1)). A commentor requested that the Commission delete andSection; 1615.150(a)(1)from its regulation, arguing that failure to require handicapped accessto all EEOC programs contravenes the legal requirement of section 504 thatall programs be accessible. As noted above, the Commission's regulationsadopts the concept in the existing regulations for federally assisted programsthat a program or activity in its entirety must be accessible. This doesnot necessarily require that each of its facilities meet this standard,although the Commission has striven to acheive this goal and will continueto do so. However, in some cases, it may be more effective to provide aprogram or a service in another facility, in order to achieve accessibility.Paragraph (a)(2) generally codifies case law that defines the scope ofthe Commission's obligation to ensure program accessibility. This paragraphprovides that in meeting the program accessibility requirement the Commissionis not required to take any action that would result in a fundamental alterationin the nature of its program or activity or in undue financial and administrativeburdens. A similar limitation is provided in andSection; 1615.160(d). Thisprovision is based on the Supreme Court's holding in <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3>v. <T3>Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979), that section 504 does not requireprogram modifications that result in a fundamental alteration in the natureof a program, and on the Court's statement that section 504 does not requiremodifications that would result in ``undue financial and administrativeburdens.'' 442 U.S. at 412. Since <T3>Davis, </T3>circuit courts have applied this limitation on a showingthat only one of the two ``undue burdens'' would be created as a resultof the modification sought to be imposed under section 504. <T3>See, e.g., Dopico </T3>v. <T3>Goldschmidt, </T3>687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association </T3>v. <T3>Lewis (APTA), </T3>655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Thus, in <T3>APTA </T3>the United States Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit applied the <T3>Davis </T3>language and invalidated the section 504 regulations ofthe Department of Transportation. The court in <T3>APTA </T3>noted ``that at some point a transit system's refusal totake modest, affirmative steps to accommodate handicapped persons mightwell violate section 504. But DOT's rules do not mandate only modest expenditures.The regulations require extensive modifications of existing systems andimpose extremely heavy financial burdens on local transit authorities.''655 F.2d at 1278. In <T3>Dopico </T3>the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitlooked at the potential expenditure of $6 million of New York City's totalfederal capital and operating subsidy for mass transit of $490 millionfor 1980 and concluded that ``[w]hile this is a considerable sum of money,it is not `massive' either in absolute terms or relative to the City'stotal receipt of mass transportation. . . .'' 687 F.2d at 650. Paragraphs(a)(2) and andSection; 1615.160(d) are also supported by <T3>Alexander </T3>v. <T3>Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985). <T3>Alexander </T3>involved a challenge to the State of Tennessee's reductionof inpatient hospital care coverage under Medicaid from 20 to 14 days peryear. Plaintiffs argued that this reduction violated section 504 becauseit had an adverse impact on handicapped persons. The Court assumed withoutdeciding that section 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an unjustifiabledisparate impact on handicapped people, but held that the reduction wasnot ``the sort of disparate impact'' discrimination prohibited by section504 or its implementing regulation. (<T3>Id. </T3>at 299). Relying on <T3>Davis, </T3>the Court said that section 504 guarantees qualified individualswith handicaps ``meaningful access to the benefits that the grantee offers''(<T3>id. </T3>at 301) and that ``<T3>reasonable adjustments </T3>in the nature of the benefit being offeredmust at times be made to assure meaningful access.'' (<T3>Id., </T3>n.21) (emphasis added). However, section 504 does not require`` `changes,' `adjustments,' or `modifications' to existing programs thatwould be `substantial' or that would constitute `fundamental alteration(s)in the nature of a program'.'' (<T3>Id., </T3>n.20) (citations omitted). <T3>Alexander </T3>supports the position, based on <T3>Davis </T3>and the earlier, lower court decisions, that in some situations,certain modifications for a handicapped person may so alter the Commission'sprogram or activity, or entail such extensive costs and administrativeburdens that the refusal to undertake the modifications is not discriminatory.Thus, failure to include such an ``undue burdens'' provision could leadto judicial invalidation of the regulation or reversal of a particularenforcement action taken pursuant to the regulation. This paragraph, however, does not establish an absolute defense; it doesnot relieve the Commission of all obligations to individuals with handicaps.Although the Commission is not required to take actions that would resultin a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or inundue financial and administrative burdens, it nevertheless must take anyother steps necessary to ensure that individuals with handicaps receivethe benefits and services of the federally conducted program or activity.It is our view that compliance with andSection; 1615.150(a) would in mostcases not result in undue financial and administrative burdens on the Commission.In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are undue,all Commission resources available for use in the funding and operationof the conducted program or activity are to be considered. The burden ofproving that compliance with andSection; 1615.150(a) would fundamentallyalter the nature of a program or activity or would result in undue financialand administrative burdens rests with the Commission. The decision thatcompliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by theChairman of the Commission and msut be accompanied by a written statementof the reasons for reaching that conclusion. Any person who believes thathe or she or any specific class of persons has been injured by the Chairman'sdecision or failure to make a decision may file a complaint under the complianceprocedures established in andSection; 1615.170. Finally, even if there isa determination that making a program acccessible will fundamentally alterthe nature of the program, or will result in undue financial and administrativeburdens, the Commission must still take action, short of that outer limit,that will open participation in the Commission program to disabled personsto the fullest extent possible. A commentor requested that this section and andSection; 1615.160 requireEEOC to consider the budget of the agency as a whole_rather than the budgetof a particular program_in determining undue financial burdens. We havenot adopted this recommendation. The regulation provides that a findingthat compliance with requirements of this section would result in ``unduefinancial and administrative burden'' can be made only by the head of theagency after consideration of all available Commission resources. (Emphasisadded). This clearly requires the Commission to consider resources beyondline item funds alloted to a particular program, but necessarily excludesfunds that are legally obligated for specific purposes and thus cannotbe made available. Because of this commitment to consider all resourcesavailable, the Commission believes, as stated above, that it rarely willbe faced with ``undue burdens'' in meeting the program accessibility orcommunications requirements of the regulation.A commentor asked EEOC to add a requirement that it will inform individualsof their right to have decisions on accessibility made at the highest levelof the Commission. Another commentor requested that more information beprovided on how the head of the agency will determine if an action imposesan undue burden. The Commission has not adopted these suggestions. Section1615.111 (Notice) provides that the Commission will make available informationnecessary to inform persons of the protections against discrimination assuredby this regulation. The Commission intends to issue a management directiveto its staff, implementing the regulation, that will emphasize that decisionsof this nature must be made by the Chairman of the Commission, and cannotbe made at lower levels. It will also make such information available tothe public through appropriate means. For example, if the Commission conductsconferences or seminars, registration forms will include such information.The Commission's implementing management directive also will provide thatwhen an accessibility issue raising resource concerns arises at any ofits offices, the Handicap Program Manager must be contacted. That officialwill provide technical guidance and will be responsible for assuring thatdecisions regarding ``undue burdens'' will be made within a timeframe thatassures that accessibility will not be denied due to untimely consideration.Paragraph (b) sets forth a number of means by which program accessibilitymay be achieved, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of servicesto accessible buildings, and provision of aides. In choosing among methods,the Commission shall give priority consideration to those that will beconsistent with provision of services in the most integrated setting appropriateto the needs of individuals with handicaps. Structural changes in existingfacilities are required only when there is no other feasible way to makethe Commission's program accessible. The Commission may comply with theprogram accessibility requirement by delivering services at alternate accessiblesites or making home visits as appropriate.Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the programaccessibility requirement. As currently required for federally assistedprograms by 28 CFR 41.57(b), the Commission must make any necessary structuralchanges in facilities as soon as practicable, but in no event later thanthree years after the effective date of this regulation.Where structural modifications are required, a transition plan shall bedeveloped within six months of the effective date of this regulation. Asidefrom structural changes, all other necessary steps to achieve complianceshall be taken within sixty days.Section 1615.151 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.Overlapping coverage exists with respect to new construction and alterationsunder section 504 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended(42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). Section 1615.151 provides that those buildings thatare constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Commissionshall be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible toand usable by individuals with handicaps in accordance with 41 CFR 101-19.600to 101-19.607. This standard was promulgated pursuant to the ArchitecturalBarriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). We believe thatit is appropriate to adopt the existing Architectural Barriers Act standardfor section 504 compliance because new and altered buildings subject tothis regulation are also subject to the Architectural Barriers Act andbecause adoption of the standard will avoid duplicative and possibly inconsistentstandards.Existing buildings leased by the Commission after the effective date ofthis regulation are not required by the regulation to meet accessibilitystandards simply by virtue of being leased. They are subject, however,to the program accessibility standard for existing facilities in andSection;1615.150. To the extent the buildings are newly constructed or altered,they must also meet the new construction and alteration requirements ofandSection; 1615.151.A commentor requested that the rule require that any leased space mustcomply with Architectural Barriers Act requirements when EEOC renews orinitiates a lease. The proposed rule noted that it has been Federal practiceto subject newly leased buildings to the lesser accessibility standardfor existing buildings, rather than the ABA standard, because retrofittingsuch buildings raises similar cost problems. In practice, the Commissionhas endeavored to assure accessibility of its leased buildings in accordancewith the Architectural Barriers Act, but it cannot make this a requirementof its regulations because the facilities it occupies are leased by andunder the control of the General Services Administration (GSA). However,the Commission has moved field offices from leased buildings that werenot accessible and has refused prospective locations offered by GSA becausethey were not accessible. The Commission recently obtained agreement fromGSA that all locations leased for Commission occupancy will be accessible.In <T3>Rose </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service</T3>, 774 F.2d 1355 (9th Cir. 1985), theNinth Circuit held that the Architectural Barriers Act requires accessibilityat the time of lease. The <T3>Rose</T3> court did not address the issue of whether section 504 likewiserequires accessibility as a condition of the lease, and the case was remandedto the District Court for, among other things, consideration of that issue.The Commission may provide more specific guidance on section 504 requirementsfor leased buildings after the litigation is completed.Section 1615.160 CommunicationsSection 1615.160 requires the Commission to take appropriate steps to ensureeffective communication with personnel of other Federal entities, applicants,participants, and members of the public. These steps shall include proceduresfor determining when auxiliary aids are necessary under andSection; 1615.160(a)(1)to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participatein, and enjoy the benefits of, the Commission's program or activity. Theyshall also include an opportunity for individuals with handicaps to requestthe auxiliary aids of their choice. This expressed choice shall be givenprimary consideration by the Commission (andSection; 1615.160(a) (1)(i)).The Commission shall honor the choice unless it can demonstrate that anothereffective means of communication exists or that use of the means chosenwould not be required under andSection; 1615.160(d). That paragraph limitsthe obligation of the Commission to ensure effective communication in accordancewith <T3>Davis</T3> and the circuit court opinions interpreting it (<T3>see supra</T3>, preamble andSection; 1615.150(a)(2)). Unless not requiredby andSection; 1615.160(d), the Commission shall provide auxiliary aids atno cost to the individual with handicaps.While in some circumstances, a notepad and written materials may be sufficientto permit effective communication with a hearing-impaired person, in manycircumstances they may not be, particularly when the information beingcommunicated is complex or exchanged for a lengthy period of time (e.g.,a meeting) or where the hearing-impaired applicant or participant is notskilled in spoken or written language. Then a sign language or oral interpreteror assistive listening device may be appropriate. For vision-impaired persons,effective communication might be achieved by several means, including readersand audio recordings. In general, the Commission intends to make clearto the public (1) the communications services it offers to afford individualswith handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from itsprograms or activities, (2) the opportunity to request a particular modeof communication, and (3) the Commission's preferences regarding auxiliaryaids if it can demonstrate that several different modes are effective.The Commission shall ensure effective communication with vision-impairedand hearing-impaired persons involved in hearings conducted by the Commission.Auxiliary aids must be afforded where necessary to ensure effective communicationat the proceedings. If sign language interpreters are necessary, the Commissionmay require that it be given reasonable notice prior to the proceedingof the need for an interpreter. Moreover, the Commission need not providedevices of a personal nature (andSection; 1615.160(a)(1)(ii)). For example,the Commission need not provide eye glasses or hearing aids to applicantsor participants in its programs. Similarly, the regulation does not requirethe Commission to provide wheelchairs to persons with mobility impairments.Readers will be provided if necessary, to make program materials accessible.Readers will not be available for reading nonprogram materials.A commentor requested revision of subsection andSection; 1615.160(a)(1)(ii)to state that the Commission need not provide individually prescribed devicesor readers for ``nonprogram material.'' The commenter asserted that thiswould clarify that the distinction is not whether the disabled person receives``personal'' assistance, but whether the aid is necessary to assure accessibilityto the agency's program. The Commission has not made this revision becauseandSection; 1615.160(a)(1) already states that it will furnish appropriateauxiliary aids necesary to provide a disabled person an equal opportunityto participate in or benefit from its programs, and that it will give primaryconsideration to the type of aid requested by the individual. Subsection(a)(1)(ii), which is identical to the language in the Department of Healthand Human Services regulations for federally assisted programs (45 CFR84.44(d)(2)), merely provides added clarification, as indicated by theexamples cited above.Paragraph (b) requires the Commission to provide information to individualswith handicaps concerning accessible services, activities, and facilities.Paragraph (c) requires the Commission to provide signs at inaccessiblefacilities that direct users to locations with information about accessiblefacilities.A commentor requested that the rule state in andSection; 1615.160(c) thatEEOC will provide the international symbol for deafness at each publictelephone accessible by amplifier or TDD, and at each primary entranceto a facility where other devices are provided to aid hearing-impairedpersons. We have not adopted this recommendation. The Commission is committedby this regulation to provide accessibility for all disabled persons. Itwould be unduly cumbersome to require special signage indicating devicesneeded to achieve accessibility for every disability. The Commission willprovide directions to locations where individuals may obtain informationon special aids or devices that will provide accessibility for them.Section 1615.160(d) limits the obligation of the Commission to ensure effectivecommunication in accordance with <T3>Davis</T3> and the circuit court opinions interpreting it <T3>(see supra,</T3> discussion of andSection; 1615.150(a)(2)). The discussionunder andSection; 1615.150, <T3>Program accessibility:</T3> <T3>Existing facilities,</T3> regarding the determination of undue financialand administrative burdens also applies to this section and should be referredto for a complete understanding of the Commission's obligation to complywith andSection; 1615.160.Section 1615.170 Compliance proceduresParagraph (a) specifies that paragraphs (c) through (m) of this sectionestablish the procedures for processing complaints other than employmentcomplaints. Paragraph (b) provides that the Commission will process employmentcomplaints according to procedures established in its existing regulations(29 CFR Part 1613) pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).Paragraph (c) designates the official responsible for coordinating theimplementation of andSection;1615.170.Paragraph (d) requires complainants to file section 504 complaints within180 days of the alleged discriminatory act unless they show good causefor a delay in filing. One hundred and eighty days is a time period thatthe Commission has recommended that other agencies could use in settingup complaint procedures. It is also consistent with the time period forfiling charges pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, asamended, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended(in areas without a state or local deferral Commission).The Commission is required to accept and investigate all complete complaints(andSection; 1615.170(d)). A commentor requested EEOC to add a provisionto this section stating that if it receives a complaint that is not ``complete''it will promptly notify the complainant that additional information isneeded, and that if EEOC dismisses a complaint after providing opportunityfor the complainant to amend it, notice of such dismissal will be givento the complainant.The Commission routinely utilizes such procedures in processing complaintsof employment discrimination; however, specific information of this naturewas not provided in this rule, which was modeled on the Department of Justiceprototype regulation. The Commission agrees with the commentor that greaterspecificity will assist potential complainants. Therefore, it has revisedsubsection 1615.170(d) and added a new subsection 1615.170(e) to providemore detail on procedures for filing and processing complaints, includingprocedures requested by the commentor.If the Commission determines that it does not have jurisdiction over acomplaint, it shall promptly notify the complainant and make reasonableefforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate entity of the Federalgovernment (andSection; 1615.170(f)). A commentor requested revision of subsection(f) to require the Commission to refer a complaint to the appropriate agencywhen it does not have jurisdiction, rather than merely making ``reasonableefforts'' to do so. Although the Commission will make every effort to refercomplaints over which it does not have jurisdiction to an appropriate federalagency, we have not adopted this suggestion because there may be circumstancesin which such referral is not possible. For example, the Commission mayreceive a complaint over which no Federal agency has jurisdiction or acomplaint that does not contain sufficient information to identify theappropriate agency.Paragraph (g) requires the Commission to notify the Architectural and TransportationBarriers Compliance Board upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a buildingor facility subject to the Architectural Barriers Act was designed, constructed,or altered in a manner that does not provide ready access to and use byindividuals with handicaps.Paragraph (h) requires the Commission to provide to the complainant, inwriting, findings of fact and conclusions of law, the relief granted ifnoncompliance is found, and notice of the right to appeal. One appeal withinthe Commission shall be provided (andSection; 1615.170(i)). The appeal willnot be heard by the same person who made the initial determination of complianceor noncompliance (andSection; 1615.170(i)). A commentor requested EEOC toprovide more information in subsection 1615.170(i) describing the basicparameters for submitting and obtaining evidence used by the Commissionto decide an appeal. The Commission has not adopted this suggestion. Detailsof this nature may be provided in an implementing directive, but are notappropriate in this regulation.Two commentors requested that we add a provision to this section statingthat a complainant can pursue a private cause of action in the courts,either without invoking EEOC administrative procedures or without exhaustingthose procedures. Section 504 does not explicitly establish a private rightof action. Courts have ruled that complainants have such a right undersection 504 in federally assisted programs, <T3>see Pushkin </T3>v. <T3>Regents of Univ. of Colo.</T3>, 658 F.2d 1372, 1377-78 (10th Cir. 1981)and cases listed therein. One Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized sucha right in regard to programs conducted by a Federal agency. <T3>Cousins </T3>v. <T3>Secretary, Department of Transportation</T3>, 47 FEP Cases (1st Cir.Sept. 20, 1988). However, in the latter case, the agency has not yet issuedSection 504 regulations for its federally conducted programs. Because theprocedures established in this regulation for its federally conducted programsdiffer from procedures applicable to federally assisted programs, the Commissionbelieves that the availability and scope of judicial review of its actionsremains for the courts to determine, and thus cannot be specified in thisregulation.A commentor recommended that the regulation provide a statement with regardto the availability of money damages or other compensatory relief. Thelower courts that have ruled on this issue are in disagreement as to whethermonetary relief may be awarded under section 504. <T3>See, e.g., Miener </T3>v. <T3>Missouri, </T3>673 F.2d 969 (8th Cir.) <T3>cert. denied, </T3>459 U.S. 909 (1982) (damages available to vindicaterights established by section 504). <T3>But see, Ruth Anne M. </T3>v. <T3>Alvin Independent School District, </T3>523 F. Supp. 460 (S.D. Tex.1982) (damages remedy not available). Thus, this issue also remains forthe courts to decide.Paragraph (m) permits the Commission to delegate its authority for investigatingcomplaints to other Federal agencies or to contract for such investigationswith non-Federal entities. However, the statutory obligation of the Commissionto make a final determination of compliance or noncompliance may not bedelegated.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR 1615</ITAG>Blind, Buildings, Civil rights, Deaf, Equal employment opportunity, Federalbuildings and facilities, Government employees, Handicapped.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC this 19th day of May 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Clarence Thomas,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Chairman.</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Chapter XIV, Title 29 of theCode of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:Part 1615 is added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1615_ENFORCEMENT OF NONDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF HANDICAPIN PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITYCOMMISSION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.101 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.102 Application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.103 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.104-1615.109 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.110 Self-evaluation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.111 Notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.112-1615.129 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.130 General prohibitions against discrimination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.131-1615.139 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.140 Employment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.141-1615.148 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.149 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.150 Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.151 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.152-1615.159 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.160 Communications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.161-1615.169 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.170 Compliance procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1615.171-1615.999 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>29 U.S.C. 794.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1615.101</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.</ITAG>The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 119 of the Rehabilitation,Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978,which amended section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prohibitdiscrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conductedby Executive agencies or the United States Postal Service.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1615.102</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Application.</ITAG>This part applies to all programs or activities conducted by the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1615.103</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>For purposes of this part, the term_``Assistant Attorney General'' means the Assistant Attorney General, CivilRights Division, United States Department of Justice.``Auxiliary aids'' means services or devices that enable persons with impairedsensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equal opportunity to participatein, and enjoy the benefits of, programs or activities conducted by theCommission.
