(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ken Oshman and other former executivesof Rolm Corp. now at Ultra Network Technologies are introducing aproduct Oshman says will revolutionize the world of high-speedcomputer networks.   ``It is, in a real sense, uncharted waters,'' Oshman, Ultra'schairman, said Monday of the new network being unveiled nextTuesday.   Ultra's system, which already has won endorsements from severalmakers of a new generation of so-called mini-supercomputers, isessentially a local area network that passes information amongcomputers at a theoretical maximum rate of 1 billion bits persecond.   Ultra can transfer the contents of an encyclopedia in a fewseconds, 100 times faster than one widely used network for officecomputers.   Supercomputers need faster local area networks because computerspeed has outpaced the ability of the machines to transferinformation.   ``Ultra has basically found a very fast way of allowinghigh-performance computers to talk to each other,'' said RichardShaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter in New York. ``It ishot stuff.''   Several makers of high-speed computers have agreed to market thenetwork and connect their machines to the system.   Rolm, his former company, was sold to IBM in 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
