She also stressed the need to uplift the lives of poor Filipinosduring an emotional eulogy for newspaper publisher Joaquin Roces,who persuaded her to run for office but later rebuked her for herfailures.   Roces, 75, publisher of The Manila Times and a key figure in thestruggle to oust former President Ferdinand Marcos, died Friday ofcancer. Prominent business and government leaders attended hisfuneral.   After receiving the Legion of Honor from Mrs. Aquino in July,Roces publicly chided her for failing to establish a ``new moralorder'' after the Marcos government fell in February 1986 and shewas swept into the presidency.   ``It hurt when he said it, but it had to be said,'' thepresident said, her voice breaking with emotion. ``And he was onewith the moral authority to say it. He has warned us that we, thefriends of democracy, shall have a worse time of it than the clearenemies of the people if we fail the people.''   The Aquino government has been under fire in the press oncharges of corruption, mismanagement and promotion of officialschosen more for loyalty than for merit.   The banned Communist Party of the Philippines sent a statementto news agencies Wednesday hailing Roces' role in anti-Marcosprotests and his later criticism of the Aquino government.   In a raid Wednesday, police meanwhile arrested Master Sgt.Godofredo Gamboa, a purported aide of former Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan. A senior officer said investigators wereclosing in on the elusive Honasan, who was arrested in December butescaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay in April.   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy military commander of Manila, toldreporters that raiders seized a .45 caliber pistol and ammunitionat Gamboa's home in suburban Caloocan city. Gamboa, a formercounterintelligence agent, denied involvement in any attempts totopple Mrs. Aquino, but Oxales said the sergeant was a ``closecontact man'' of Honasan.   Gamboa faces weapons charges.   Wednesday's arrest brought to 74 the number of allegedright-wing figures taken into custody in recent weeks, includingkey officers of last year's failed coup which left at least 53 deadand more than 300 wounded.   Honasan played a major role in the military-civilian revoltwhich toppled Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino to office. He grewdisillusioned with Mrs. Aquino, however, complaining that shefailed to crush the communist rebellion, now in its 19th year, andrid the government of corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
