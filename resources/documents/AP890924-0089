The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying that 90percent of the oil was sold for cash rather than bartered forgoods, a development he called unprecedented since the 1979revolution.   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Aqazadeh as giving theexport figure Saturday but it did not specify exactly how manymonths he was referring to.   Iran has an output quota of 2.78 million barrels a day set bythe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Iran's oil output during the eight-year Gulf war with Iraqplunged below 1 million barrels a day at times. Both belligerentstargeted each other's oil industries in an effort to cut theireconomic lifelines.   The Iranian oil minister also said the war-devastated Abadanrefinery on the Gulf coast had been rebuilt at a cost of $40million and its capacity has reached 130,000 barrels a day.   Aqazadeh was quoted as saying imports of refined gasoline havestopped because domestic refineries had been rebuilt, and thegovernment was considering lifting gasoline rationing.   In addition to the recent ending of gasoline imports, only aportion of the country's needs in kerosene and gas oil were beingimported, Aqazadeh said.   Iran will stop importing these two items after the Arak andBandar Abbas refineries are put back into operation, he was quotedas saying.</TEXT></DOC>
