Already it's clear that thelegislation will be inferior to President Bush's original proposal.He should veto it.   During his presidential campaign last year, Bush stressed hiscommitment to provide some form of relief for families with workingparents, and rightly so. The need for day care is among thenation's fastest growing concerns. ...   Cost estimates for the Democratic plans range from $10.3 billionto $22 billion over the next five years. They target not just thepoor but also families who make as much as 100 percent of theirstate's median family income.   While some tax credits _ the heart of Bush's plan _ areincluded, the bulk of the money will go toward block grants tosubsidize institutional child-care facilities. And attached tothose federal funds is a raft of regulations, along with thebureacracy to make sure they're followed to the letter.   The White House has already labeled the final child-care bill,whatever its precise form, a ``veto candidate.'' Now the presidentshould follow through, and then tell Congress to take another lookat his own, perfectly sound proposal.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 12   The Observer, La Grande, Ore., on summits:   We've had arms control summits and economic summits; recently wehad an education summit. Now President Bush is planning to attend adrug summit ... in Latin America. ...   (Summits) are mostly useless ceremonial exercises that result innothing more substantial than a considerable burnishing of theparticipants' public images. ...   The recent education summit resulted in nothing more than aresolution to appoint a study panel to set goals for education inAmerica. ...   What is needed is grass-roots support for real improvements, andit's difficult to see how the summit-appointed study panel willhelp.   It is likewise difficult to imagine what sort of substantialaction could result from the planned drug summit. ...   (It) would be wiser for President Bush and his advisers to avoidexcessively building up expectations in advance. Summits are mostlytheater.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 13   Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times on the drug summit:   President Bush didn't waste a moment in accepting an invitationfrom the presidents of the cocaine-producing nations of Colombia,Peru and Bolivia to attend a ``drug summit'' within the next 90days. ...   There's certainly nothing wrong with that ... but he and hisadvisers should take pains to ensure that there will be more to thedrug summit than photo opportunities and rhetorical variations onthe theme that the traffic in illicit drugs is a Really Bad Thing.   Bush must carry to the meeting ... proposals for aiding thegovernments of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia in their struggle withthe traffickers _ proposals including economic incentives, lawenforcement assistance and, if requested, military aid.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 11   Valley News, Lebanon, N.H., on U.S.-Chile:   While politicians in Washington exchange accusations over who isto blame for the failure to overthrow Panama's Manuel Noriega, thepeople of Chile are quietly preparing for presidential elections inDecember. For them, it will be the first meaningful election since1973, when Gen. Augusto Pinochet overthrew Salvadore Allende.   Chile provides an instructive comparison to Panama because it,too, had to free itself from the rule of a ruthless dictator. Inthe case of Chile, the United States let the Chilean people do thework of delivering themselves from an unwanted government.   While Washington has made clear its distaste for the Pinochetgovernment, it left the job of pressuring the military governmentinto reform to the people who were suffrering under its rule.   There is no morally defensible way that the United States canpick and choose among nations in which it wants to play kingmaker.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 13.   The Florida Times-Union, Jacksonville, Fla., on Panama:   Swaggering Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega plays heavily on LatinAmerica's traditional fear of ``Yanqui imperialism'' to dignify hiscriminal rule in Panama, but the old trick didn't work.   The Group of Eight, an organization of Latin American nations,said in Ica, Peru, that Panama's suspension from the regional forumwould continue until democracy is restored in Panama.   Panamanians have further reason to rid themselves of Noriega:national pride. Noriega and his mob have been branded usurpers.Panamanians can erase the ensuing blot on their nation's reputationonly by giving Noreiga the boot.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 15   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on Panama:   President Bush correctly handled the failed coup attempt againstPanamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega. ...   If the people of Panama want Noriega out, let them arrange it,not us. To do otherwise is too much like the Soviet troops inAfghanistan. ...   Bush should let the Panama crisis cool. He should bide his time.Noriega can't last.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
