Former hard-line party leader Erich Honecker was expelled fromthe party he had led for 18 years until he was ousted and replacedby Krenz on Oct. 18.   Three recently fired Politburo members were arrested oncorruption charges, and a senior trade official fled East Germany.   Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, who was generallyconsidered a reformer, announced the resignations of the 10-manPolitburo and the 163-member Central Committee on state radio.   They came as the Communist Party's policy-making CentralCommittee met in an emergency session following demands from theburgeoning pro-democracy movement that Krenz, 52, resign. He wasjeered by party members Saturday.   The resignations were the latest development in a historicseries of political changes that have transformed East Germany froma hard-line Communist nation to one that is at the forefront ofEastern Europe's reform movement.   Under pressure from mass demonstrations and the exodus ofthousands, East Germany has thrown open its borders and the BerlinWall, and lawmakers eliminated the Communists' constitutionallyguaranteed leading role in society.   In a deperate attempt to retain power and put a lid on thepro-democracy movement, Krenz had promised the people that he wouldinvestigate disclosures of corruption and high living among topparty officials.   The Communist Party on Sunday expelled a large number of itsformer leadership, including Honecker, former Premier Willi Stophand former Parliament speaker Horst Sindermann, the state-run newsagency ADN said.   The move came after growing calls for the resignations of Krenzand the entire leadership amid charges of massive corruption in thetop party ranks.   One of those arrested was the senior economic adviser toHonecker.   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, a state secretary in the foreigntrade ministry, fled East Germany after authorities opened aninvestigation against him for suspected illegal weapons sales, ADNsaid Sunday.   Schalck-Golodkowski was East Germany's chief trade negotiatorand had headed a department responsible for making hard-currencysales.   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said Schalck-Golodkowski wasstripped of his functions following his escape. ADN said he went toWest Germany on Saturday for trade talks and returned to EastGermany later the same day.   Wolfgang Vogel, the country's most prominent lawyer, toldauthorities early Sunday that Schalck-Golodkowski was ``at anunknown location outside East Germany'' and that he had asked Vogelto represent him, according to ADN.   The investigation was opened after officials Saturday discovereda secret operation to ship weapons to the Middle East, Africa andSouth America, ADN said. Hard-currency earnings from the sales wentto the country's foreign trade bank addressed toSchalck-Golodkowski, it said.   On Saturday, 3,000 Communist Party members jeered Krenz andwhistled when he promised the party would investigate disclosuresof corruption and high living among top party officials. ``Toolate!'' they shouted.   Ousted Politburo members Guenter Mittag and Harry Tisch weretaken into investigative custody suspected of ``heavily damagingsocialist property and the people's economy through abuse ofpower,'' ADN said Sunday.   Also arrested was Gerhard Mueller, a former party leader in thecity of Erfurt and former candidate member of the Politburo.   Prosecutors issued the arrest warrants Saturday, and they wereapprehended later, the news agency said. It did not specify whichday.   Mittag had been the senior economic adviser to Honecker. TheCommunist Party has blamed the two for East Germany's economiccrisis and has begun a disciplinary investigation of them. Mittagwas ousted from the party last month.   Tisch had been the chief of the Communist-run trade unionsfederation until the organization expelled him on Nov. 27. He alsowas removed from the ruling Politburo last month for allegedlyabusing his powers.   Two other former high-ranking Communist officials were arrestedon Saturday. Hans Albrecht, the former party chief in the Suhlregion, and Walter Wolf, director of a large home constructioncompany in Suhl, were arrested under suspicion of ``fraudulentlydamaging socialist property,'' ADN said without elaboaration.   On Friday, lawmakers heard complaints at a parliamentary sessionthat top officials had taken bribes, indulged themselves withluxuries at state expense and stashed away more than $54 billion inforeign bank accounts.   Since taking over from Honecker on Oct. 18, Krenz has begun aprogram of sweeping reforms that includes promises of freeelections and abolition of the Communists' 40-year monopoly ofpower.   Krenz was jeered in a speech Saturday night outside the CentralCommittee building. It was his latest attempt to distance himselffrom the old hard-line leadership, of which he was a prominentmember. He has denied living opulently, as other leaders did underHonecker.   The lavish lifestyles of top party officials have been a majorsource of discontent in a country where the average citizen has towait 10 years or more for a car.</TEXT></DOC>
