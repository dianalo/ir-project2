James McClure might havequietly hammered out differences between their rival bills to makecertain that plastic pistols can't get through airport metaldetectors.   But history has taught that a gun control engagement is neverfought with silencers, even in rare instances like this one, whenrival sponsors have identical goals: stopping terrorists,especially at airports.   So once again, bitter enemies of past gun control struggles arefollowing the usual rules of engagement _ high-powered lobbying,full-page advertisements, fund-raising appeals and doomsdayrhetoric.   Sparking the latest debate is a weapon not even on the market.Red Eye Arms of Winter Park, Fla. says it has a patent for plasticweapons, but won't start making handguns for at least two years _and then only for military and police use.   ``We would never allow anyone to build an undetectable civilianhandgun,'' said company vice president Dwight Brunoehler.   Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and McClure, R-Idaho, have vastly differentapproaches to require that the guns be made detectable. Both wouldban manufacture or importation of any guns that did not meet theirstandards.   Metzenbaum's bill would require a minimum weight of metal toensure that an alarm would be triggered at today's magnetometersettings. Its target is not only future plastic guns, but pint-sizemetal pistols that are not detected today.   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms estimatesthere are three small metal guns that could get through mostmagnetometers now used. The gun owners' lobby estimates there arecountless other models.   McClure's legislation targets plastic guns only, and has nominimum metallic requirement. However, it would require that gunsbe detectable, by either including some metal, a serial numberengraved or stamped on metal, or a substance detectable by X-raymachines used for luggage.   Using today's technology, McClure's bill would require moresensitive magnetometer settings, more alarms, and therefore moreairport passenger inconvenience _ some say gridlock.   Brunoehler, of Red Eye Arms, says his firm has developed acomputer chip for plastic guns that would make the lower settingsunnecessary. The chip would emit a signal that would make it appearthat an enormous amount of metal was passing through the machine,he said.   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar said theFAA is aware of the chip, but believes it could be disabled bydrilling a hole in it or even placing the weapon in a microwaveoven.   While these are the technical points for debate, a congressionalgun fight often ranges far beyond the issues at hand and this oneis no exception.   The principal gun owner's lobby, the National Rifle Association,told its 2.8 million members in a fund-raising letter last yearthat Metzenbaum's real goal is ``the first federal gun ban bill inAmerica.''   ``If Sen. Metzenbaum's bill passes, the next thing will be somegovernment official knocking at your door to weigh your guns forinspection,'' said the NRA, which backs the McClure bill.   To Handgun Control Inc., the most visible lobby for pistolregulation, the issue is what the group calls the NRA's extremism.``Cop-killer bullets, mail-order handguns, machine guns...has theNRA gone off the deep end?'' says HCI ads, which have differentpolice chiefs using those same words.   Handgun Control supports Metzenbaum. So do a dozen lawenforcement organizations.   ``Both sides are simply waving flags so believers will sendmoney to Handgun Control Inc. and to the National RifleAssociation,'' says John Aquilino, a former NRA official who nowpublishes his own gun owners' newsletter. ``They're makingadvertising agencies very wealthy. It's flag-waving andfund-raising.''   The latest battle reflects new political realities that surfacedin 1986. Then, the major law enforcement organizations joinedforces with handgun control advocates to fight NRA-backedlegislation to ease many restrictions of the 1968 Gun Control Act.   The presence of uniformed policemen lobbying their locallawmakers began to neutralize some of the NRA's seeminglyinvincible clout.   Nonetheless, the gun lobby attained many of its goals two yearsago with passage of the McClure-Volkmer Act, which changed a numberof provisions of the 1968 law. But the invigorated guncontrol-police alliance was able to retain, as part of that fight,a ban on interstate sales of handguns.   Now, the same coalition of police and gun control advocates isback on the detectability question. But Jerald R. Vaughn, executivedirector of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, saysof his fellow police lobbyists, ``We're still babes in the woodswhen it comes to the political process.''   Yet, the NRA has taken an unusual turn by backing McClure'sbill. The group normally opposes any legislation that could bringmore restrictions on firearms.   Only last May, NRA Governmental Affairs Director James Jay Bakertold a House panel, ``The NRA believes that the only workableapproach'' to the detection problem is better security at airports.   He said ``attempts to dictate metallic content of firearms orchemical composition of non-metallic components of firearms'' wereunnecessary.   ``Their position from day one has been, there shall never be anylaw on guns,'' said N.T. ``Pete'' Shields, chairman of HandgunControl Inc.   ``All of a sudden this issue of plastic handguns has made themcompromise this whole concept. I think they have come a long way,but I think they're trying to address it with smoke. McClure's billis impractical. You would bottle up the airport.''   Baker said in an interview, ``The NRA has moved a long way onthis issue. We decided to take the bull by the horns and deal withthe terms as framed by the other side. If they're interested indetectability, it can be done with no interference with existingfirearms.''   Metzenbaum's most prominent Senate ally is Strom Thurmond, aconservative South Carolina Republican and ranking Republican onthe Judiciary Committee. Metzenbaum and Thurmond tried to winpassage of their legislation last December, but it was tabled by a47-42 vote.   Metzenbaum, in an interview, called McClure's bill ``purelycosmetic.''   McClure, also in an interview, said he rejects any arbitrarymetallic standard, and called any potential inconvenience ``part ofthe price you pay for having secure airports.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, March 14</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
