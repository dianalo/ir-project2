But theyaren't tapping their bank accounts; they are drawing cashwelfare benefits.   The ATM is part of a new attempt by the federal governmentto streamline the welfare system by delivering benefitselectronically rather than through food stamps or welfarechecks. The White House Office of Management and Budget isrunning the Baltimore experiment, and it recently created acommittee on &quot;electronic benefits transfer,&quot; withrepresentatives from five cabinet departments. Meanwhile,several pilot projects exploring the electronic-benefits ideaare beginning to attract the attention of a presidential taskforce seeking ways to &quot;empower&quot; the poor.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It fits into the empowerment idea,&quot; says CatherineBertini, assistant agriculture secretary for food andconsumer services, because it gives welfare recipientsgreater control over their benefits. &quot;It shouldn't bedifficult for people to access government services of anykind,&quot; she says.   &quot;It just makes all the sense in the world,&quot; adds formerbudget director Joseph Wright, whose strong support forelectronic benefits in the waning days of the Reaganadministration led to OMB's current involvement.   By transmitting cash, food stamps and other assistanceelectronically, state and federal officials hope to reduceadministrative waste and recipient fraud. They also hope tomake welfare benefits less stigmatizing and inconvenient forrecipients -- a possibility that has stirred some debate.   &quot;The question is, do we want it to be easy and convenientto be on welfare?&quot; asks Charles Murray, a poverty scholar atthe American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C. &quot;Itseems to me one of the most available and effective penaltieswe have associated with welfare is stigma.&quot;   But Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budgetand Policy Priorities, which studies poverty issues, arguesthat for welfare families, &quot;increasing stigma to a pointwhere children in those families go to bed hungry is not myidea of an enlightened social policy.&quot;   In any case, electronic welfare is &quot;definitely the wave ofthe future,&quot; says Robert Lynch, president of TransFirstCorp., a unit of Dallas-based Affiliated Computer Systems.The company has contracted to convert state and federalassistance programs from paper to computer in several states,including New York and Minnesota.   In Maryland, TransFirst computerized benefits forrecipients of food stamps and Aid to Families With DependentChildren living in Park Circle, a low-income Baltimoreneighborhood chosen by the state to participate in theOMB-supervised pilot program. Before 1989, the roughly 5,000welfare recipients in Park Circle received welfare checks andfood stamps once a month. They got their checks by mail andpicked up their stamps at private coupon distributorscontracted out by the state.   Now a plastic debit card, called the &quot;Independence&quot; card,has replaced these paper benefits. Card holders may withdrawcash up to the amount of their monthly AFDC benefit from oneof several ATMs in downtown Baltimore. The same ATMs alsoserve regular bank customers.   The Independence card can also be used at grocery storesin Park Circle to charge food items against creditaccumulated in an electronic food stamp account. The foodstamp transactions are conducted with the aid of a small,slotted point-of-sale terminal that is provided free tostores that want them: A cashier enters the purchase priceand runs the debit card through the slot, the purchaserenters a personal identification number, and the store iscredited for the sale.   &quot;Your Independence Card Is Welcome Here&quot; reads a sign inthe window of a Super Pride Market in Park Circle. Welfarerecipients lining up to buy groceries or withdraw rent moneypraise the debit-card system. &quot;It's better,&quot; says 35-year-oldLynette Jackson, a stout, bespectacled woman. &quot;You don't haveto wait for the mail.&quot; Others say electronic transfer reducestheir anxiety about crime because there are no welfare checksto be stolen from mailboxes.   Moreover, because the Independence card enables holders todraw cash in small amounts --a  luxury previously unavailableto many welfare recipients because nearly half lack bankaccounts -- cardholders are less worried about being robbed.&quot;It helps {for the money} to be in a bank rather than athome,&quot; says Pamela Williams, an 18-year-old mother of twins.   Retailers are even more enthusiastic. Michael Mann,manager of financial systems for Washington-based Giant FoodInc., says the Independence card has raised productivitybecause it eliminates the laborious end-of-the-day task ofcounting and bundling food stamps. Electronic benefits alsoincrease sales, because the on-site terminals provideconvenient access to benefits. Quincy Mason, vice presidentof operations for Super Pride, says the Park Circle store sawa surge in business this year, in part because of theIndependence card.   About the only objections to the card in the businesscommunity come from proprietors of check-cashing centers,which routinely charge welfare recipients 2% to cash amonthly AFDC check -- a service that would be wiped out by afull-scale switch to electronic benefits. &quot;I think this isjust a high-tech way of spending money,&quot; complains Dan Cohan,president of the Maryland Check Cashers Association.   Government officials concede that most of the federalpilot programs haven't saved the government money -- yet. ButStan Frerking, information management director for Maryland'shuman resources department, insists that's because most ofthem involved only one type of aid. By putting multiplebenefits on one card, Mr. Frerking says, Maryland's programhas realized economies of scale that will create $1.2 billionin taxpayer savings within a year. Now Maryland Gov. WilliamDonald Schaefer, a Democrat, is urging adoption of the debitcard program statewide.   Officials at the federal Health and Human Services andAgriculture departments have given the plan conditionalapproval -- but have asked that this time the exuberantgovernor refrain from putting his name on the cards.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          MARYLAND'S PILOT PROGRAM for electronic transfer ofwelfare benefits is expected to create $1.2 million intaxpayer savings within a year.
