Itwas shown in which fields of nuclear physics this semiclassical theorycan be applied and how it is to be understood. In this connection wededicated an extensive discussion to the Fermi gas model. From the freeresponse function we calculated the RPA response with a finite-rangeresidual interaction which we completely antisymmetrize. In the secondpart of this thesis we studied with our theory (e,e') data for the separatedresponse functions. (orig./HSI).</TEXT></DOC>
