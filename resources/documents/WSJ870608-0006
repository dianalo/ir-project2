They refused to rule out a preemptive U.S. strike.    &quot;I really think that the United States ought to keep all its options open. The first option ought to be that the Iranians will decide not to roll those missiles out and put them on their sites,&quot; said White House Chief Of Staff Howard Baker on CBS-TV's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;    Mr. Baker said that as the U.S. continues a commitment first made by President Carter and reiterated by President Reagan to protect free transit of international commerce, &quot;we ought to have the military might to make it go. And we ought to retain the ability to do whatever we need to do make sure that happens. And the Iranians ought to wonder about that.&quot;    National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci, interviewed on Cable News Network, said that the U.S. doesn't want to &quot;provoke Iran&quot; but said &quot;they should know we will respond, that our ships are prepared to defend themselves&quot; militarily if the Iranians attack the U.S.-protected ships in the Persian Gulf.    Privately, White House officials expressed optimism that both the Soviet Union and China might go along with a United Nations resolution urging a ceasefire and a return to original borders to end the Iran-Iraq war.    They emphasized, however, that hurdles still remain before either the Soviets or the Chinese agree to a tough sanctions section of the resolution, which would approve an arms embargo with sanctions against the arms suppliers. The Chinese have refused to acknowledge that they supplied the Silkworm missiles to Iran, Mr. Carlucci said Saturday.    Senior administration officials participated in five broadcast or taped television interviews here yesterday to establish the U.S. agenda as the seven-nation economic summit gets under way with a formal dinner tonight. Mr. Reagan is expected at the dinner to press the allies for more support in the Persian Gulf and in East-West arms-reduction efforts.    Mr. Carlucci said yesterday that the U.S. and Soviet Union are talking about a possible Reagan-Gorbachev summit this fall. &quot;Assuming progress, something in the fall sounds reasonable,&quot; he said. &quot;We've gotten far enough on substance so there have been some general discussions on dates.&quot;    He said that while the U.S. supports the principle of on-site inspections to assure that any arms agreement is being observed, he didn't rule out possible &quot;selective exemptions&quot; to those on-site inspections in both countries. </TEXT></DOC>
