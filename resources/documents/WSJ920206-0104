Crude oil prices closed at the top of recent tradingranges in both U.S. and European futures markets.</LP><TEXT>   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for Marchdelivery settled 23 cents higher at $19.50 a barrel. OnLondon's International Petroleum Exchange, Brent crudefutures settled as much as 16 cents higher.   Iraq drew credit for launching the rally, which beganTuesday, by refusing to participate in further talks with theUnited Nations over terms of a proposed emergency sale of$1.6 billion of Iraqi oil. The latest talks were scheduled tobegin yesterday in Vienna, but the Iraqi officials didn'tshow. Also yesterday, the U.N. Security Council officiallyretained economic sanctions against Iraq to cast furtherdoubt of any resumption soon in Iraqi oil exports.   But some traders and analysts suggested yesterday'sfirming in prices was due more to technical and other factorsthan to Iraq's withdrawal from the Vienna talks.   &quot;Technicians like the way the market has bottomed out,&quot;said John Hill, a vice president with the Merrill Lynchenergy trading desk. He noted the price of March crude brokethrough significant levels, including $19.50 a barrel atwhich it settled. Also, &quot;the product supply-demand picture isbeginning to look a little tighter,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;Behindit all, OPEC meets in a week.&quot;   Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries meet in Geneva next Wednesday to decide on outputlevels. Prices usually firm ahead of such meetings as tradersturn cautious.   At an economic forum in Switzerland, OPEC SecretaryGeneral Subroto said &quot;the first round&quot; of measures to soak upa world overhang of oil already has been taken by pledges ofnine exporters to cut production a total of 415,000 barrels aday. According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report,Mr. Subroto estimated current OPEC output at 24.2 millionbarrels a day.   That is in line with the latest estimates by theInternational Energy Agency. In its Monthly Oil Market Reportreleased yesterday, the agency, based in Paris, estimatedthat OPEC's crude oil output totaled 24.3 million barrels aday in January, down slightly from the December level.Although OPEC's voluntary cuts had &quot;no discernible effect&quot; onJanuary volumes, they are expected to affect Februaryexports, the energy agency said.   The agency also reaffirmed its expectations that world oildemand, sluggish last year until a fourth-quarter rebound,will continue rising. The agency reiterated earlierprojections that world oil demand will average 66.8 millionbarrels a day for all of 1992 and 67.9 million barrels a dayfor the first quarter, up 400,000 barrels a day for eachperiod.   Most of the first-quarter increase is expected in the24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment. The energy agency, which represents theseWestern nations, said that OECD oil demand in the 1992 firstquarter is projected to increase 1.5% to 39.1 million barrelsa day. All of the growth is expected to occur in NorthAmerica. The energy agency said this reflects the weak levelof demand in the year-earlier quarter &quot;but also assumesincreased economic activity.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of wheat and soybean futurescontracts settled mixed amid growing confusion over how theformer Soviet republics want to use the latest allocation ofU.S.-backed food-buying loan guarantees. Traders are waitingfor the Agriculture Department to unveil the mix of U.S. foodthat the Commonwealth of Independent States plans to buy withthe $200 million of loan guarantees they are slated toreceive this month. The U.S. has already agreed to allocateadditional loan guarantees to the commonwealth in March andApril. Grain traders are also mulling reports that Russia isasking for a large allocation of loan guarantees separatefrom the commonwealth.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices tumbled. Juice for Marchdelivery dropped 3.35 cents a pound to $1.3785. CelesteGeorgakis, senior analyst at Cargill Investor Services, saidbearish sentiment was heightened on Tuesday when the fourmajor processors in Brazil released a 1992-93 crop projectionof 253 million 90-pound boxes, up from this year's estimated245-million-box crop. Judith Ganes, senior analyst at MerrillLynch, added that government estimates of the Florida orangecrop are expected to be raised by three million to fourmillion boxes next Tuesday from the current projection of 136million. Meanwhile, consumption in the U.S. is expected to besluggish, and perhaps even decline, because of the recessionand price increases earlier this year in major brands, Ms.Georgakis said. Brazilian processors have been reluctant tolower cash prices, currently at $1.75 a pound, Ms. Ganessaid, but pressures are increasing as futures prices fallfurther. Futures prices could fall an additional 10 cents,Ms. Ganes predicted.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices continued to fall toward theirlowest level since the collapse of the international quotasystem three years ago. March coffee settled at 68.90 cents apound, down 1.85 cents. Coffee prices bottomed soon after thequota system ended in 1989 at 68.3 cents, which was thelowest price since the early 1970s. Selling from producersand roasters' reluctance to buy while prices are in a freefall continue to push prices to new life-of-contract lows,said Ms. Georgakis of Cargill. Brazil is expected to producea bigger crop than previously projected and Colombia produceda bumper crop this year, she said. But consumption levelshaven't changed, she added, and inventories in consumingcountries remain very high. Prices might find support around65 cents, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
