GM said Monday that it expected to pay out about $90 million toits 450,000 hourly and salaried employees who worked all of 1988, orabout $200 per worker. Those working less than a full year couldreceive lower payments.   About 200,000 of the GM workers are employed in Michigan.   The estimated 1988 payments are based on a new profit-sharingformula first negotiated between the United Auto Workers union andFord Motor Co. in 1984 and now in place at Chrysler Corp. and GM aswell.   But employees at Ford _ which has fewer employees than GM but ismore profitable _ could expect profit sharing payments of more than$2,100 each this year, company spokesman Tom Foote said. Fordworkers have received profit sharing each year since 1984, includingan average $3,700 per worker in 1987.   Chrysler employees could expect profit sharing payments exceedingthe $500 minimum guaranteed under the No.3 automaker's contract withthe UAW, said Anthony St. John, vice president of human resources.   GM said in a statement that a large capital-expenditure programleft its 1986 and 1987 earnings too low to trigger profit-sharingprovisions. Much of that program, which included the addition of newequipment, has been completed.   ``The GM employees have been part of a truly great team effort toredirect GM to assure its competitive position for the future,''Chairman Roger B. Smith said. ``We have come a long way, and theprofit-sharing payments are further evidence that General Motors hasturned the corner and is achieving improved results in our U.S.operations while providing job security for our employees.''   The payments, to come out of GM's pretax profits from domesticoperations, were made possible by improved sales and quality andsuccessful cost-control efforts, Smith said.   ``While the anticipated amount of profit-sharing per worker willbe quite modest, the basic news that GM is making money while ourmembers enjoy greater job security provided under the nationalagreement is welcome indeed,'' UAW President Owen Bieber and VicePresident Donald Ephlin, director of the union's GM department, saidin a joint statement.   The formula now in place with all Big Three automakers is basedon the ratio of profits to U.S. sales rather than profits exceedinga defined minimum annual return. GM's expected 1988 payments willtrail those of Ford in part because GM earns a greater share of itsautomotive profits overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
