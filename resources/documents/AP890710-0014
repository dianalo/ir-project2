The ruptured Exxon Valdez is expected to generate about 300 extrajobs at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. under a repaircontract from Exxon Shipping Co. worth about $25 million.   The Valdez, built at the shipyard in 1986, ripped its hull openMarch 24 on Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound. Nearly 11million gallons of crude oil poured into the sound, polluting parksand fishing areas and killing wildlife.   ``I think San Diegans are as disturbed about the oil spill asanyone,'' said Max Schetter, director of the Chamber of Commerce'sEconomic Research Bureau.   ``But despite the disaster, the ship does need to be repaired andthis is the best place to do it,'' he said. ``It means jobs for SanDiegans and it is a shot in the arm for a company just recentlypurchased by its employees.''   Like other American shipyards, NASSCO has been struggling to stayin business in the face of increased foreign competition. Since1978, 55 U.S. shipyards and repair facilities have closed with aloss of 60,000 jobs, according to the Shipbuilders Council ofAmerica in Washington, D.C. Just Friday, the last shipyard operatingout of Los Angeles Harbor announced it was closing.   In April, NASSCO employees purchased the shipyard from MorrisonKnudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho, and the Valdez repair was the firstcontract they secured since the ownership change.   The NASSCO work force has declined from a peak of 8,700 in 1980to 2,700 today. During the projected nine-month repair, NASSCO isexpanding its work force to 3,000.   Restoring the tanker to original specifications will requirereplacing about 3,000 tons of steel, about 10 percent of itsstructure.   The approximately 42 million gallons of oil that remained in the987-foot Valdez after the accident was transferred to other tankers.The ship was then refloated, cleaned and given partial repairs whileExxon searched for a drydock to rebuild it.   Exxon initially considered taking the Valdez to Portland, Ore.   But the Coast Guard and the Oregon Department of EnvironmentalQuality feared there would be residual oil in the tanker that couldfoul the Columbia River at Portland, and drew up a long list ofconditions for Exxon to meet.   Also, the Coast Guard Capt. James Calhoun in Portland warned inApril that ``radical elements'' might resort to violence if thetanker went to Portland.   Carrie Chassin, a spokeswoman for Exxon Shipping Co., saidExxon's decision to bring the ship to San Diego had nothing to dowith concern over public opposition in Portland.   ``It was a business decision,'' she said. ``The concern inPortland originated very early on, before we knew we could get allthe crude off. We were able to totally steam clean the ship andthere is no residual cargo.''   ``Once we were assured and had knowledge that the ship was notgoing to cause an environmental problem, we were pleased to get thework,'' said Fred Hallett, NASSCO's vice president of finance andpublic relations.   The Valdez lifted anchor June 23, towed by two tugboats. OnTuesday, San Diego chief harbor pilot Capt. Edward J. Silva Jr. _who happens to be a member of the militant environmental groupGreenpeace _ will guide the Valdez through San Diego Bay to a NASSCOdock.   While the Valdez is off the coast Monday, the Coast Guard willconduct a final inspection before clearing the ship to enter theharbor.   Seven Coast Guard and Harbor Police boats will ring the vessel toprevent spectators and possible protests from disrupting the ship'sharbor movements.   Environmental groups have announced they plan demonstrations butwon't organize disruptions.   ``We don't want to block it because we feel the safest place forthis thing right now is on dry dock,'' said Rick Nadeau, director ofGreenpeace in San Diego.   Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and several other environmentalgroups plan a joint rally in Coronado to coincide with the Valdez'sarrival.   ``We do want to make a public statement that this ship has becomea symbol of ocean and atmospheric destruction,'' Nadeau said.   As ``far as we're concerned, it's being repaired so it might goout and have another accident,'' he said. ``Hopefully, it won't butit's not impossible.''</TEXT></DOC>
