Rundle (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CI ALD AET </CO><IN> INS </IN><TEXT>   Insurance companies have been trying for some time to nudge American workers out of free-choice health plans. Now they are giving them a heavy shove.    Many insurers, including Cigna Corp., Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., and Prudential Insurance Co. of America, are stepping up pressure on companies to shed the traditional free-choice indemnity plans that reimburse employees for most of their medical costs while giving them total control over selecting a doctor.    The pressure is a little bit carrot, with a lot of stick. Insurers are shocking clients with rate increases of 25% or more for the free-choice plans, or in some cases refusing to renew the plans at any price. As a substitute, they are offering their own health maintenance organizations, which are more restrictive but less expensive than the free-choice programs. These plans are potentially more profitable for the insurers and are designed to combat inroads into their business by independent HMOs and other health-care groups.    For some employees the new opportunities to go with an HMO or other physician network may be welcome. But the new pressure may rankle some employees who like the flexibility of free-choice plans, but now find them prohibitively expensive. HMOs allow patients to use only those doctors and hospitals the HMO has contracts with, usually at discounted rates, and operate in a way that tends to reduce referrals to specialists and to limit their fees.    These latest efforts will likely continue the trend away from free-choice plans, which fell to 44% of insurers' commercial business last year from 96% in 1984, according to a study to be published this summer in Health Affairs, a policy and research journal.    The impact on individual states has been even greater. For example, &quot;in a matter of two or three years, the old free-choice indemnity plans won't exist anymore&quot; in California, predicts F.X. McLellan, vice president in Aetna Life Insurance Co.'s Western headquarters in Walnut Creek, Calif. (California already has one of the highest HMO enrollment rates in the country.) Other states leading the way in the disappearance of free-choice plans are Arizona, Washington, Illinois and Florida.    And others states are likely to follow. They have no choice, insurers say: Free-choice plans have simply become too expensive to operate.    For one thing, insurers say that younger workers are more easily lured to independent HMOs because they are less likely than older employees to have formed close physician relationships. But that means that the HMOs are siphoning off companies' youngest, healthiest workers, leaving the free-choice plans with relatively older, sicker employees.    Moreover, as doctors and hospitals increase the number of patients they treat at a discount -- namely those enrolled in HMOs -- subsequent fee increases fall heavily on the patients in the free-choice plans, who aren't shielded from rising prices.    &quot;The (free-choice) indemnity plan is the most likely candidate&quot; to bear the brunt of such a discounting policy, says Jim Zishka, benefits manager for St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., a unit of Southwestern Bell Corp.    That, in turn, becomes a vicious circle: As costs for the free-choice plan rise, more employees switch to HMOs, which accelerates the free-choice plan's decline. &quot;Any time the (HMO) plan gets 40% or more, the death spiral for the indemnity plan has set in,&quot; says Mr. McLellan of Aetna.    That's what happened at a former Aetna customer, Dataproducts Corp. of Woodland Hills, Calif. As more and more of the company's roughly 2,000 employees joined outside HMOs in recent years, the number of workers in Aetna's free-choice program dwindled. Based in part on its claim to be covering Dataproducts' costliest users of health care, Aetna demanded &quot;significant double-digit&quot; annual rate increases. The computer-equipment maker passed part of the higher costs on to employees, which in turn pushed more of them into HMOs.    After the company's HMO participation hit 60% last year, Aetna refused to renew Dataproducts' free-choice plan at any price, saying that there were so few employees in the plan that one expensive operation would wipe out any potential profits, says Dataproducts' Treasurer Cliff Bickell. The company then dropped its two HMOs and enrolled its workers in Prudential's physician network. Aetna, which does operate some physician networks, doesn't have one near Dataproducts.    One of the largest companies to adopt an insurer-run physician network so far is Allied-Signal Inc., which recently announced that it was shifting its national work force of 67,000 into a more-restrictive health-care plan run by Cigna. Previously, the Morristown, N.J.-based technology company offered a variety of HMOs and free-choice indemnity plans.    Under the new program, Allied-Signal's employees can select from a network of physicians controlled by Cigna and pay a flat $10 a visit; all hospital costs are paid. Or employees can continue to choose their own doctor and pay more -- a lot more. For example, a married employee with children who earns $50,000 a year would pay 3% of his salary, or $1,500 of medical bills, before any insurance kicks in.    &quot;We decided that (the program) is more cost effective and wanted to encourage people to use it,&quot; says Joseph Duva, Allied-Signal's employee-benefits director.    Allied-Signal embraced the plan. Last year, the company saw its health-care bill jump 39% to $355 million. &quot;We estimated that costs would reach $614 million by 1990 if we did nothing,&quot; Mr. Duva says. &quot;We had to make a complete change.&quot;    ---                The Move Away From Free Choice                                         1984      1987    Free Choice                           96%       40%    Physician network                      1%       16%    Fee-for-service with restrictions      3%       44%   Note: Physician networks include programs such as health maintenance organizations; fee-for-service plans with restrictions include features such as advance review of hospital admissions; and in free choice plans, employees have total control over the selection of a doctor.
