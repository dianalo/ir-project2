Carrier-free [{sup 67}Ga]citrate seemsto follow the physical diffusion of citrate ions into the cell, and thepresence of carrier gallium inhibits that diffusion, reducing considerablyits uptake. These results appear to support the hypothesis that increasedpermeability of tumor cells is the principal cause of [{sup 67}Ga]citrateaccumulation by tumors.</TEXT></DOC>
