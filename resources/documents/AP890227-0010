They expect to pay a price.''   A better way to assess how the United States is doing in the waron drugs is to ignore the ballyhoo about drug busts and concentrateon the price and purity level of drugs on the street, says Sen.Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.   ``For too long, when we've asked whether or not our drug strategyis working, the administration has cited record arrest and seizuredata,'' said Biden, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.   A check of price and purity of drugs on the streets, Biden said,reveals that ``cocaine and heroin on the streets are much cheaperand more potent than they were five years ago.''   In 1982, cocaine sold at the retail level at a nationwide rangeof $2,000 to $3,000 per ounce and was 50 percent to 60 percent pure,said DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty.   In 1988, the street price of cocaine had dropped to $500 to$2,000 per ounce and it was 80 percent pure, said Dougherty, whosaid the information came from drug seizures, undercover drug buys,intelligence gathered and records seized.   The amount of drugs seized ``is not a dent'' in comparison withwhat is coming into the country and being produced domestically,said DEA spokesman Maurice Hill.   Given the uncertainty over exactly how large the nation's illegaldrug market is, there are very few solid numbers about anything,which gives drug busts and amounts seized a certain cachet.   There is not even a clear total of the amount of seizures aroundthe country, the one number in the maze of drug statistics thatcould be expected to be solid. One problem is that many differentagencies may take credit for the same bust.   ``It's a quagmire,'' says Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson. ``Ifyou add them up, you'll find the government (claiming it) got 10times what it actually seized. ... Everyone's trying to makethemselves look good.''   Simpson outlined a hypothetical case in which the DEA providesthe intelligence on an incoming shipment, Air Force radar locatesthe ship, a Navy jet spots the ship, the Coast Guard tracks it andthe final seizure is conducted by a local sheriff in Florida.   ``Even if everyone was trying to do the right thing and no onewas trying to cheat, it would still be a nightmare'' to sort out thevarious claims for responsibility, even though the agencies attemptto note when they have assisted and when they have made a seizurealone, he said.   This problem was noted in 1983 by the General Accounting Office,the investigative branch of Congress, and some efforts have beenmade to correct it.   ``We've tried to get all the federal agencies to call into the ElPaso Intelligence Center where they give each seizure anidentification number in case other police agencies claim it aswell,'' said Hill, who still acknowledged ``there's no real way'' totell how much the federal government seized last year.   Norsworthy, who is special assistant to the special agent incharge of EPIC, said that this program of giving each seizure aFederal Drug Identification Number ``does avoid duplication.''   However, Norsworthy said EPIC has not been providing annualtotals for federal drug seizures and the information it startedcollecting only recently is limited because seizures must meet athreshold _ such as a minimum of 1 pound of cocaine _ before theyare given identification numbers.   In addition, ``absolutely no one'' is compiling figures of localpolice seizures unless they choose to call in, he said.   ``I don't believe that you will find a good, true figure (of thetotal amount of drugs seized),'' said Norsworthy.   Robert S. Weiner, a spokesman for the House Select Committee onNarcotics Abuse and Control, said he's not concerned about someduplication of seizure numbers, even if it's being done so agencieswill look better and possibly get more government money for theirefforts.   ``Those guys need all the help they can get,'' Weiner said.Committee Chairman Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., ``doesn't think you canoverplay the danger and hard work the front lines in law enforcementhave.''   Disregarding the likelihood of duplication, the federal agenciesdon't make it easy even to add up what they each claim to haveseized by maintaining different methods of calculation. Some compilefigures by calendar years, others by fiscal years that start Oct. 1;some report on the number of pounds of drugs seized, others onkilograms.   Law enforcement agencies also repeatedly seize millions ofdollars in drug profits that go unclaimed, because anyone claimingthe money would have to prove it was his and say where it came from,Hill said.   ``I recall a little old lady way back in the early 70s who handedme a shoe box full of $20 bills and said she was being paid to carryit to a woman in Colombia,'' Norsworthy said. The woman, whodisclaimed any knowledge of the contents or the rightful owner, wasallowed to continue her trip and the government got the money sinceno one claimed it.</TEXT></DOC>
