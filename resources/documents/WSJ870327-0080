The agreement was negotiated by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), sponsor of the legislation, and Sen. Robert Stafford (R., Vt.), the AFL-CIO and certain strategic companies. It guarantees a broader range of support for the legislation.    &quot;My sense is that this bill now addresses most of the major concerns that have been expressed by a wide segment of the business community,&quot; said Bud Ward, director of environmental and occupational health for the American Electronics Association, a trade group.    The legislation, known as the High Risk Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention Act, would establish a federal program to notify and advise certain workers about health risks they face from exposure to hazardous workplace substances. The compromise version would tighten scientific standards for determining whether such hazards exist, limit potential liability arising from the program for both the government and corporations, and eliminate a quota set in the original bill of 100,000 notifications annually.    The AFL-CIO and the electronics trade group, which represents 3,300 companies, sent letters of support on behalf of the revised legislation to Capitol Hill. Mr. Ward of the electronics group said similar letters would follow soon from General Electric Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. Other business groups that had been opposed to the legislation couldn't be reached for comment.    Sen. Metzenbaum will offer the compromise version during a scheduled April 9 meeting of the Senate labor subcommittee, which he chairs. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House. Though Republican and business dissent is expected to continue, a Democratic aide said: &quot;It's somewhat unusual to get a major corporation signing on to a worker-protection bill. That ought to make senators sit up and take notice.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
