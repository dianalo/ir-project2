Toyota, the nation's biggest car company, said exports increased 3.3%, to 159,449 vehicles, the first increase in eight months. The company cited increased shipments to Europe, Southeast Asia and the Mideast. But exports to the U.S. fell 6.6%, to 78,555 units, and analysts said they were pessimistic about the export outlook.    &quot;The increase could well prove to be temporary as Toyota may have to slow exports to adjust U.S. inventories,&quot; said Takaharu Itoh, senior auto analyst at Vickers da Costa Ltd.    Toyota sold 156,561 vehicles in Japan, up nearly 12% and a record for September. Officials said changes in the Corolla and Sprinter models aided sales. Toyota's share of the Japanese market was 29.3%, down from 38.6% in August.    Production rose 2.8%, to 329,295 units, a record for the month.    Nissan's exports gained 1.7%, to 98,664 vehicles. Those to the U.S. rose 2.7%, to 48,265 units, but exports to the European Community tumbled 29%, to 14,893 vehicles.    Domestic sales increased 1.5%, to 95,689 units. Nissan officials said much of the growth stemmed from a continuing expansion in sales of the upscale Gloria and Cedric models. Nissan's share of the domestic market fell to 17.9% from 23.4% in August.    Production increased 5.4%, to 201,786 vehicles. </TEXT></DOC>
