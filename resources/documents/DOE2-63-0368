At 200 min the HPI began to inject water intothe core, which resulted in a primary system depressurization due tosteam condensation, and the pressurizer water drained into the vessel,increasing the core level. It is believed that the core was completelycovered by water by about 207 min, when the pressurizer level decreaseand the RCS depressurization stopped. Continued HPI injection resultedin increasing hot leg water levels, and the pressurizer level began toincrease at about 210 min, when water reached the level of the surgelineentrance to the hot leg. A set of equations describing the refill phenomena,and accounting for compression of the noncondensible gases, have beenderived from theoretical considerations, and solutions for water levelsthroughout the RCS have been obtained to predict the above describedincidents during the refill period. 4 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
