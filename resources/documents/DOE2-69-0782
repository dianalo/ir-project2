Permeability measurement of the recovered materialsloaded to 56-80 GPa showed critical temperatures of about 8K and 15K.The fact that the transition at 15K was not observed with the startingcomposition indicated that it was newly created by the shock synthesis.The shock compression of tetragonal Nb{sub 3}Si was measured by the impedancematching method in the pressure range of 20 - 110 GPa with copper asthe standard reference material. The volume reduction and incrased densityobserved near 30 GPa was probably attributed to the structural transitioninto the A-15 phase. (7 figs, 6 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
