(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The University of Michigan regents lefttheir regular meeting under guard and went into closed sessiontoday for the second day in a row after they were disrupted bystudents protesting anti-discrimination policy.   There were scuffles between security guards and some of the 30protesters who attended the open meeting after the regents were ledout, but no injuries were reported. At least three people were hurtduring a similar confrontation Thursday, when protests also forcedthe regents into a closed meeting.   Soon after the closed meeting began, the protesters left theadministration building, shouting they would return with enoughstudents to surround it, WAAM radio reported.   Corey Dolgon, chairman of the Campus Governance Committee of theUniversity of Michigan Student Government, said the students wantedto let the regents know how angry they are about a proposedanti-discrimination policy and about being shut out of the meeting.   The anti-discrimination policy was meant to counter racial andsexual harassment on campus.   The Michigan Student Assembly and other opponents complain thatinterim president Robben Fleming drafted the policy withoutconsulting students and that it targets student misconduct withoutaddressing such action by the university and its administrators.   Fleming ``has a history of neglecting student input, and nowhe's trying to throw this code down the students' throats,'' JackieVictor, a former co-chair of the student assembly's Peace andJustice Committee, said Thursday.   Protesters also demanded the dismissals of Regent Deane Bakerand Peter Steiner, dean of the College of Literature, Sciences andArts.   Victor said Baker has offended students for years with hisattitudes about minorities and homosexuals and his support formilitary research at the university.   Steiner has been under fire since January, when studentsobtained a copy of his remarks during a closed faculty meeting inSeptember when he warned against lowering university standards torecruit more black students. He later apologized for phrasing ofhis remarks but denied they were racist.   On Thursday, about 35 students protested during a public boardof regents session and demanded the dismissal of Fleming and twoother top officials, said Joseph Owsley, the school's director ofnews and information.   The regents adjourned and headed upstairs to a conference roomto continue the meeting without spectators, Owsley said. Theprotesters followed them and tried to enter the room while securityguards held them back, he said.   At least two school officials and one protester were slightlyinjured, but none required hospital treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
