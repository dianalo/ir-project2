Garcia</HL><DD> 03/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Oil-related and technology issues led a powerful rally that carried stock prices to records.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average sprinted ahead 36.36 points to close at 2284.80, surpassing its high of 2280.23 established March 6.    The broader market averages advanced a bit less sharply, but still managed to close at record levels. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 4.24 to 292.47, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 2.07 to 166.41. Both indexes moved beyond highs established last Thursday.    The strong gains in most oil stocks gave a boost to the industrial average and the Sandamp;P 500-stock index, and there was strong demand in the futures market yesterday for contracts based on the Sandamp;P index.    Yesterday's rally took many traders and analysts by surprise, since most had expected institutional investors to stay out of the market this week to avoid the wild price gyrations that often accompany the expiration of stock-index futures, index options and individual stock options. March contracts in all three categories will expire Friday afternoon.    Volume on the Big Board rose to 177.3 million shares from 134.9 million Monday as gainers swamped decliners by a 2-to-1 margin.    Secondary stocks, such as those traded in the over-the-counter market and at the American Stock Exchange, also participated in yesterday's rally. The Nasdaq OTC composite index rose 3.93 to a record 434.79 as volume expanded to 153.9 million shares from 131.3 million Monday. There were 1,366 issues advancing and 955 declining. The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index rose 4.06 to a record 335.24.    Traders' reaction to a somewhat larger than expected 2.6% rise in housing starts last month along with a 4.4% increase in building permits, which usually are seen as a precursor of construction activity, contributed to the stock market rally. However, as expected, commercial construction figures remained soft as developers continued to adjust to the tighter real estate provisions of the new tax law.    Interest rates declined slightly, despite the continued rise in oil prices. Bond market traders were betting that the oil price rally will be short-lived and they remained somewhat skeptical about the health of the economy. They also took comfort in comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker, who said a recent meeting of big industrialized nations &quot;should foster more stability in exchange rates around their current values.&quot;    The oil stock rally that began quietly Monday afternoon exploded yesterday. Among the gainers were Exxon, up 2 1/4 to 84 3/8; Standard Oil, up 2 1/2 to 64 3/8; Atlantic Richfield, up 3 1/2 to 78 3/4; Chevron, up 1 3/4 to 55 1/2; Pennzoil, up 3 to 81 3/4; Texaco, up 7/8 to 35; British Petroleum, up 1 5/8 to 54; and Royal Dutch Petroleum, up 2 3/8 to 114 7/8.    The recent gains in crude oil prices have been fueled by increasing signs that OPEC is holding down oil production. Sanford Margoshes, an oil industry analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York, added that oil inventories are being drawn down without depressing prices.    Barry Good, who follows the oil industry at Morgan Stanley, said &quot;it looks like we have a buying panic&quot; in the oil stocks. He said that these stocks aren't widely owned by many portfolio managers. So, any money manager who hopes to beat the performance of the Sandamp;P 500 and all the portfolios that are patterned on this index will have to buy some of these shares pretty quickly.    Yet, he believes that many investors are focusing on OPEC and have lost sight of the dismal earnings prospects that many of the integrated oil companies face in the first half of this year. While crude oil prices are rising, he said prices for natural gas, which many of these companies also produce, have hardly moved recently. He worries that based on 1987 estimated earnings, both domestic and international oil companies are overvalued right now. &quot;What bothers me is that (investors) try to come up with some fundamental to justify the stock prices,&quot; he added.    Ashland Oil illustrates the difficult outlook to which Mr. Good referred. The stock slid 2 1/4 to 64 in reaction to the company's statement late Monday that it expects a loss from operations in its second quarter ending March 31. Ashland, the nation's largest independent oil refiner, earned $1.12 a share from operations a year earlier.    Du Pont rose 4 1/4 to 111 3/4. The company, which owns Conoco, said it knew of no specific reason for the price gain. But it noted that the stock seems to be trading as an oil issue. USX, which owns Marathon Oil, rose 5/8 to 26 5/8 on more than 2.2 million shares.    The stocks of oil service companies moved right along with the oil producers. Halliburton rose 3 to 34 5/8, Dresser International gained 7/8 to 27 7/8, Schlumberger rose 2 to 39 3/8, Baker International added 1 5/8 to 17 3/8, and Hughes Tool gained 1 1/2 to 13 3/4.    Airline stocks, usually hurt by the higher cost of energy, were spared a beating. Some registered minor gains, while USAir fell 1 to 44 1/4.    Drug stocks were generally higher, with Merck up 5 1/8 to 160 3/8, Squibb up 3 1/2 to 159 1/2, and Eli Lilly up 1 3/8 to 95 7/8. Upjohn fell 2 1/2 to 132 3/4. Some analysts reacted negatively to a government panel's qualified recommendation for Upjohn's anti-baldness drug.    F.W. Woolworth slid 3/4 to 46 1/2. K mart said it plans to continue operating its Kresge chain rather than sell the unit to Woolworth.    AmeriTrust Corp. soared 4 7/8 to 51 in OTC trading. A group led by Equitable Bancorp. Chairman Alfred Lerner said it holds a 9.6% stake in the company.    Another OTC issue, Sterling Inc., fell 2 to 20 1/4. The company reported higher fourth-quarter net but also announced plans for an offering of 1.5 million shares. Included will be 500,000 shares to be sold by certain stockholders, primarily members of the investor group that acquired the retail jewelry store chain in a June 1985 leveraged buyout.    Taft Broadcasting rose 3 1/8 to 156. Early yesterday an investment group headed by Taft's vice chairman, Dudley S. Taft, sweetened its bid to acquire the company to &quot;in excess of $150 a share&quot; from $145 a share. Taft had rejected the $145-a-share bid last week.    Turner Broadcasting slipped 1/8 to 21 7/8. Time Inc. said it's negotiating to join an investor group that is buying a 35% stake in Turner. Time was unchanged at 88 1/8.    Caesars World was unchanged at 29 1/2 on volume of nearly a million shares. The company has filed a lawsuit against Martin T. Sosnoff and MTS Acquisition Corp., which launched an unsolicited $28-a-share tender offer for Caesars World last week. Among other things, the suit alleges that the offering is illusory and designed to manipulate the market in Caesars stock to enable Mr. Sosnoff to sell the Caesars shares he already owns at a profit. </TEXT></DOC>
