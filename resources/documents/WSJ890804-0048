One of the likely captors is Imad Mugniyah, who is said to wear three guns at all times: one on each side and one on his back. Another is Hussein Musawi, a school teacher turned terrorist.    The president also knows which neighborhoods, and even which buildings, have been used to imprison the hostages at various times. Even now, Joseph Cicippio and the remaining American hostages are believed to be held in Chiyah, Borj El Brajne or another of the cinderblock slums of south Beirut.    But Mr. Bush has been unable to act because the U.S. has no way of pinpointing the hostages' locations at any moment. As a result, the U.S. has been paralyzed by perhaps 500 hard-core fanatics wedged into a few sectors of a country smaller than Connecticut.    &quot;Nobody can look the President in the eye and say, 'I guarantee you if you move within the next X hours or days, they're there and there's a 90% chance of success,'&quot; says Richard Murphy, who was President Reagan's assistant secretary of State for the Middle East. &quot;It isn't that kind of situation.&quot;    U.S. intelligence forces' embarrassing inability to penetrate the terrorists' world is due largely to the nature of Lebanon's Shiite Moslems, who comprise the most aggressive of that war-torn country's sects.    The religious warriors holding the hostages operate in a network of family alliances that nurture and protect them. They live in a rabbit warren of flat-roofed concrete buildings, where outsiders are quickly identified and confronted. No local government dares intrude. Their willingness to die for their cause is evident in the 1989 &quot;Martyr of the Month&quot; calendar, featuring pictures of fallen zealots.    They are members of the Shiite sect of Islam and of its militant Lebanese organization, the Party of God, or Hezbollah. Galvanized by generations of poverty and discrimination in their own country, they have taken their inspiration from Iran's late Ayatollah Khomeini, who was the world leader of the Shiites.    They hate the Israelis who invaded their southern Lebanese villages in 1982 -- and Israel's patron, the United States, which sent Marines into their domain until Shiite terrorists slaughtered 241 of them by driving a bomb into their barracks.    The importance of bloodlines is visible in the intensely personal aspects of the terror. Some of the Hezbollah captors -- including those who have kidnapped Americans -- are seeking to have their own relatives freed from captivity in Kuwaiti, Israeli and German jails.    Mr. Mugniyah, for instance, has a brother-in-law jailed in Kuwait after his conviction for bombing the U.S. and French embassies there in 1983. Mr. Mugniyah wants the U.S. to pressure Kuwait into releasing his brother-in-law. Mr. Mugniyah's wife works at his side wearing a dark Islamic veil.    Another Hezbollah clan holding hostages, the Hamadis, is pressuring West Germany for the release of one of its members, Mohamed Hamadi, who was convicted for his role in the 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847, in which an American sailor was murdered.    But even these details are sketchy, so poor is U.S. knowledge about Hezbollah. There is always a chance, of course, that the Central Intelligence Agency knows more than it is letting on. And it's possible that Israel's kidnapping of a local Hezbollah leader, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, could yield an intelligence bonanza sufficient to break the hostage case.    But U.S. officials, right up through Mr. Bush, insist they lack hard intelligence data on the hostages. From space, the U.S. can photograph a street intersection in south Beirut and it routinely intercepts telecommunications. But to no avail. &quot;There is no substitute to people who are on the ground,&quot; says Sen. Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee.    The situation on the ground is one of anarchy. Lebanon may be the least-governed patch of the planet. There is no civil government or police force worthy of the name that could help the U.S. The country is divided into sections controlled by Syria, allies of Israel, Christian warlords, Sunni Moslems, Druze, and at least two groups of Shiites, including Hezbollah.    &quot;In the south of Beirut, there is no control at all. You have one law there, and it's the law of Hezbollah,&quot; says a leading French expert on terrorism who writes under the pen name of Xavier Raufer.    There is already much American blood on the hands of Hezbollah. It planned the bombing of the Marine barracks near Beirut in 1983, slaughtering 241 Marines who were on a peacekeeping mission. One of Hezbollah's leaders, Sheik Abbas Musawi -- who himself is believed to be a relative of one of the hostage-takers -- yesterday bragged about the Marine massacre, publicly taunting Mr. Bush about it.    The group has twice bombed U.S. embassy buildings in Beirut, killing a total of 72 people, including the CIA's top Middle East expert, Robert Ames, and several of his deputies. During two airline hijackings, in 1984 and 1985, Hezbollah members singled out American passengers and killed them. The murder toll also includes hostage William Buckley, who was the CIA station chief in Beirut; Malcolm Kerr, the president of the American University there, and now, presumably, Col. William Higgins, who headed a U.N. peacekeeping force.    To the extent they know much of anything, U.S. intelligence experts suspect that such Hezbollah groups as &quot;Oppressed of the Earth,&quot; which claimed to kill Col. Higgins, and &quot;Revolutionary Justice,&quot; which is threatening Mr. Cicippio, aren't really separate groups at all. Instead, those and other fearsome-sounding names, experts think, could be cover names for carrying out actions approved by Hezbollah's ruling council.    Even if the CIA could send a Lebanese-American agent into Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, experts say he wouldn't get far. &quot;I wouldn't say it's difficult to infiltrate. I'd say it's impossible,&quot; says Mr. Raufer, the French consultant. &quot;You'd have to be not only an Arab, not only Lebanese, but able to show you came from some particular family in some particular village in southern Lebanon.&quot;    And if not? &quot;You'd end up like William Buckley,&quot; Mr. Raufer says.    The U.S. also lacks reliable local allies who might help. American intelligence was well-wired among Lebanon's Christians and Palestinians, but the Christians have no entree into Hezbollah areas and Palestinian leaders have been driven out of Lebanon by Israel.    Another problem is that Hezbollah is compartmentalized into small terrorist cells that move among multiple bases and that cooperate with each other. Former French hostages report that a French book taken from one of them later was given to a second who had supposedly been captured by an entirely different group. Some other former hostages report being moved -- sometimes in car trunks, wrapped like mummies -- from one building to another.    &quot;These people aren't arrayed like conventional forces. They scatter like sand crabs,&quot; says Noel Koch, the Pentagon's former chief counter-terrorism official.    Hezbollah terrorists occupy, in addition to their south Beirut stronghold, several buildings in the town of Baalbek. The third home base for Hezbollah-affiliated families is in south Lebanon, where Shiite villages are clustered, and where Col. Higgins was seized.    These sites, including the Sheik Abdullah Barracks in Baalbek, have been photographed from the air by the Pentagon. Plans were drawn years ago for bombing them. But a French bombing raid in 1983 had little effect, and it's doubtful that the terrorists are staying there in large numbers during the current crisis.    Even if the U.S. could play on the Hezbollah's turf, it wouldn't be comfortable with the eye-for-an-eye rules. In 1985, for instance, after four Soviet diplomats in Lebanon were kidnapped and one killed, Moscow got the Druze to snatch some of the kidnappers' relatives. The Soviet hostages were freed after a body part from one of the relatives was mailed to the terrorists.    But the State Department the same year vetoed a CIA plan to kidnap Mr. Mugniyah while he was traveling in Paris. The State Department nixed the action to avoid offending France, according to an account in &quot;Best Laid Plans,&quot; a book about the failed war on terrorism. </TEXT></DOC>
