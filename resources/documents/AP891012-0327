There's virtually no way it can spread around and causeany significant damage at all.''   But others feel the threat is real from the so-called ColumbusDay virus, programmed to activate after computers' internal clockshit 12:01 a.m. Friday and begin doing its dirty work when anoperator begins using an infected program.   ``We're talking about a communicable disease that is absolutelyindiscriminate,'' said Winn Schwartau, president of AmericanComputer Security Industries in Nashville, Tenn.   ``It's not going to be Armageddon today or tomorrow. But if youignore it and you're infected, the risk is high for getting yourdata destroyed,'' Schwartau said.   By coincidence, more than 2,000 of the nation's top computersecurity experts convened their annual meeting Thursday inBaltimore, Md.   Few, if any, opted to stay on the job because of the virusthreat, according to the sponsoring National Institute of Standardsand Technology and the National Computer Security Center.   Only a tiny fraction of the nation's 40 million users ofpersonal computers are expected to catch the virus, officials saidat a news conference.   ``We want to send a calming message to people that if they takereasonable precautions, this virus poses no more danger than anyother,'' said Thomas P. Malarkey, deputy chief of the computerservice office of the federal National Computer Security Center.   A computer virus is the electronic equivalent of a biologicalbug. It is a malevolent program designed to sneak through acomputer system on infected disks or in programs copied overnetworks from electronic bulletin boards.   Once activated, the rogue program copies itself like a breedinggerm, eating away processing power and storage space or evendestroying information. About 30 viruses are known to exist, notcounting strains and mutations.   The Columbus Day virus, also known as Datacrime, is programmedto scramble indexing information in IBM or IBM-compatible personalcomputers. It would be the equivalent of zapping index cards in alibrary so books would be impossible to locate.   The virus, of unknown origin, has been identified about 12 timessince March 1, when experts discovered suspicious strings of codethat had attached themselves to programs. The confirmed cases ofColumbus Day viruses were discovered before they did any realdamage. A number of programmers, including IBM, have developed waysto detect if a disk or program has been contaminated.   IBM took 2,000 calls since Oct. 2 on a special hotline forpeople who want its virus scanning program.   ``We're taking the threat seriously,'' said IBM spokesman ArthurHill. ``You don't defeat computer viruses. You detect them anderase them.''   In South Carolina, the Budget and Control Board checked itscomputers.   ``It's being handled exactly like a bomb threat,'' saidspokesman Larry Huckabee. ``I think you have to be serious aboutit, but not necessarily alarmist.''   Also lurking in computer networks is another virus which hasstrains known as Jerusalem, Friday the 13th or PLO.   Russ Sura of Antiquity Piano Co. in South Amboy, N.J., on Mondaylost all the business information he had in two computers to theJerusalem strain.   ``How would you feel if every piece of business information wasstuck on a computer and you couldn't get it out? Those dirty dogs.I got hit but good,'' Sura said Thursday.   ``They've stolen time from me. This will take two to four daysof work to correct,'' Sura said. ``This is worse than theheartbreak of psoriasis.''   To avoid losing information, PC users have been warned to makeduplicates of their programs. They can lower risks of infection byavoiding disks, networks and shared programs that may becontaminated.   Some users also have moved up their computer clocks to make Oct.13 ``arrive'' early and try to bring the virus out into the open.   But some experts insist the fuss in unwarranted.   ``You have more chance of being hit by lightning than gettingthis virus,'' said John McAfee, chairman of the Computer VirusIndustry Association in Santa Clara, Calif. ``The virus is aphantom. It's a media virus. Nothing is going to happen.''   Computer viruses are similiar to sick practical jokes done bymischief-makers.   ``Why do folks call in bomb scares? It's the thrill of knowingyou're driving a bunch of people nuts,'' said Steinauer. ``Youcan't stop it anymore than you can stop people from writinggraffiti on subway walls.''   He said that perhaps the point of the virus threat is thatcomputer users should take measures to protect themselves.   ``If this threat has done nothing more than gotten everyone togo out to make back-up files, then maybe it's not such a badthing,'' Steinauer said. ``The bottom line is, make a back-up andget back to work,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
