<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-1252 </DOCNO><TEXT>We report the results of Raman measurements performed on polycrystallinesamples of superconducting Tl{sub 2}Ca/sub n//sub -1/Ba{sub 2}Cu/subn/O/sub 4+2//sub n/ (n = 1,2,3) with well-characterized transport, magnetic,and structural properties. The room-temperature first-order Raman spectraof polycrystalline samples of predominantly Tl{sub 2}Ba{sub 2}CuO{sub6}, Tl{sub 2}CaBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 2}O{sub 8}, and Tl{sub 2}Ca{sub 2}Ba{sub2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub 10/ phases, with respective superconducting transitiontemperatures of 10, 110, and 125 K display a systematic variation withthe number of CuO{sub 2} layers and great similarities with the Ramanspectrum of YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7}. Comparison with Raman spectraof the impurity phase candidates BaCO{sub 3}, BaO{sub 2}, BaCuO{sub 2},CaCuO{sub 2}, Tl{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and TlCa{sub 5}Cu{sub 6}O/sub x/ allowsidentification of intrinsic Raman modes of the superconducting phases.Factor group analysis of the three body-centered tetragonal structuresspace group 14/mmm, yields the mode classifications and the atoms involvedin the modes of A{sub 1}/sub g/ and B{sub 1}/sub g/ symmetry correspondingto c-axis motion that produce the strongest modulation of the polarizability.The systematic variation between the spectra of the three phases andcomparison with the well-characterized YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 5}O/sub x/ Ramanspectrum suggests mode assignments for the high-frequency modes of A{sub1}/sub g/ and B{sub 1}/sub g/ symmetry involving oxygen motion.</TEXT></DOC>
