The highflying, San Francisco-based telephone servicecompany has captured the heart of Wall Street ever sincegoing public in 1987. Earnings and revenue have risensharply. Cash on hand has risen to $27 million. Long-termdebt is naught.</LP><TEXT>   But developments in California's regulatory environmentare casting a shadow over Centex's bread-and-butter business.   Centex is like few other companies. It is part middleman,part consultant, part telephone service manager. In returnfor a fee, Centex links small businesses to the localtelephone company and routes customer calls over any of thevarious lines and services offered by the local company aswell as ATandamp;T, MCI and others.   Until now, Centex has benefited from an anomaly inCalifornia's rates. Pacific Bell has a lock on the toll callswithin each local telephone area, such as from San Jose toSan Francisco. For California's small users, such local tollcalls are far more expensive than in other states. In fact,Los Angelenos can talk to New Yorkers more cheaply than tomany of their in-state neighbors.   Centex has prospered by buying telephone service at thebulk rates available to large users and offering savings tosmall businesses. But California is restructuring rates. Thestate's Public Utilities Commission is expected to open uplocal toll calls to competition and to cut rates by as muchas 30% to 40%.   What's more, Pacific Bell asserts that Centex, amongothers, rents a type of dial tone service at a price belowPacific Bell's cost. Though Centex disputes this, some ofCentex's costs could well be raised. A PUC draft decision onrate restructuring is expected this summer.   David Shantz, a program manager in the PUC's Division ofRatepayer Advocates, which represents telephone users, says,&quot;Centex is what I call a price arbitrager. As toll rates comedown, the ability of Centex to compete will diminish.&quot;   Amy Newmark, an analyst with Homans McGraw Trull Valeo andamp;Co., sees &quot;a major negative impact.&quot; Centex &quot;won't be theonly game in town&quot; for customers seeking an alternative toPacific Bell, and there will be less reason to seek such analternative, she says.   Peter Howley, an MCI and ATandamp;T veteran who is chairman ofCentex, concedes that the changes in California mightadversely affect some of Centex's business, but he says thatin the long run Centex will benefit from increasedcompetition. Moreover, he asserts that the savings Centexoffers on California toll calls are a small part of itsappeal.   Although 80% of its billings are in California, Centex isexpanding on the East Coast. And Mr. Howley, in general,plays down Centex's appeal as a discounter. &quot;Five years ago,it was easy to show a big saving,&quot; he says. Today, as longdistance competition heats up, analysts say the saving hasprobably diminished.   Mr. Howley doesn't dispute this. He says Centex's basicappeal is that it relieves small companies of the burden ofpicking a carrier and of managing its phones. In a favoredphrase, Centex provides a &quot;single point of contact&quot; for acustomer's telephonic needs. That is intended to ringnostalgic with those yearning for the simplicity of the MaBell era.   Centex also offers various teleservices, such as reportsallocating a customer's calls to the customer's variousclients. James Hickey, an analyst with William Blair, says,&quot;They are that friendly voice you used to hear when youcalled ATandamp;T.&quot;   Jerry Oliver, a specialist on regulatory matters for PacBell, agrees that Centex has carved out a niche as a&quot;telemanager.&quot;   But analysts say it costs Centex more time and money tomarket to clients on the basis of service, rather than onprice. And while the company is upbeat about its expansion inthe East, analysts say Centex has yet to achieve theeconomies of scale -- or the profit margins -- that it has inCalifornia. Certainly, Centex's profit would seem to behighly vulnerable to regulatory changes in its home state.   Ms. Newmark asserts that &quot;telemanaging&quot; requires no hardassets and little technology or capital. Thus, she wonderswhy, if the business is so good, Centex has yet to attractmuch competition. Since the barrier to entry would seem to below, Ms. Newmark says Centex's stock should trade at a modestmultiple of earnings.   Tom Barton, a partner of Feshbach Brothers, which has soldshort some Centex stock, betting that it will drop, says,&quot;Centex's real game is rate arbitrage, and this game isover.&quot; Mr. Barton could be wrong. But with Centex's stockselling at 23 times estimates for 1990 earnings, investorshave a great deal to lose if he is right.   ---   Centex Telemanagement   (OTC; Symbol: CNTX)                                                                                                          Business: Telecommunications                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1989:   Revenue: $82.8 million   Net income: $7 million; or 72 cents a share                                                                                                          First quarter, March 31, 1990:   Per-share earnings: 21 cents vs. 15 cents                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume:   93,071 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 9.4 million</TEXT></DOC>
