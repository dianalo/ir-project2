Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut, which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year, when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the House.    Nevertheless, Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking GOP member on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary.    Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds, perhaps as soon as today. Mr. Packwood all but conceded defeat, telling Mr. Mitchell: &quot;I sense at this stage you may have the votes.&quot;    The two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion, violating usual Senate decorum. Their tone was good-natured, with Mr. Packwood saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and Sen. Mitchell saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again.    Although the proposal, authored by Mr. Packwood and Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), appears to have general backing by Republicans, their votes aren't sufficient to pass it. And Democrats, who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains-tax cut, are finding reasons to say no, at least for now. A major reason is that they believe the Packwood-Roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run.    The Packwood-Roth proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held. It also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes, including retirement, medical expenses, first-home purchases and tuition.    &quot;A number of us are not going to touch capital gains, IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction,&quot; said Sen. Charles Robb (D., Va.), who is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats who the Bush administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains.    President Bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with Democratic senators at the White House. And at a luncheon meeting Tuesday of Democratic senators, there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year, according to participants.    The trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success. &quot;There is a one-out-of-three shot of getting it this year,&quot; said Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, a leading Democratic proponent of cutting the capital-gains tax. He called the battle &quot;uphill.&quot;    Other Democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic. &quot;There will be no capital-gains bill this year,&quot; said Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.). &quot;I'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal. The IRA portion (of the Packwood-Roth plan) is irresponsible.&quot;    Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell has made clear to his wavering colleagues that the issue is important to him personally.    Today, Sen. Mitchell and other leading Democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal. Estimates requested by Sen. Mitchell from the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $13 million each in 1985, the last year for which figures are available.    White House officials acknowledged yesterday that Democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the Packwood-Roth capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck Sen. Mitchell. As a result, the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with Senate Democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut.    Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of &quot;tinkering&quot; with the Packwood-Roth proposal, suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back, one official said.    In addition, White House aides think that there are numerous other important measures Democrats badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with Democrats. A capital-gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage. Other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage.    If they can't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan, administration officials also aren't ruling out making a deal with Congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future, even next year. But the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the House and the Senate.    ---   Gerald F. Seib contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
