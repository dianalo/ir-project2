Akers and other key IBMexecutives were reduced in 1989 from the compensation received by theseindividuals in 1988.andM;Gannett staff writer Mark Land compared the most recent IBM proxy statement,sent to shareholders this month, to previous statements and found that Akers'1989 compensation, $1,940,713, was 3% less than his 1988 figure of$2,000,500.andM;Akers' compensation and that of other key executives is determined by theboard of directors' five member compensation committee with each executivebeing judged on individual contribution as well as the company's financialperformance.andM;A Newsbytes source within IBM who asked not to be identified said that &quot;thereductions are consistent with IBM policy and are not a reflection on Akers'individual performance.andP;  From the level of director on up, total compensationis based on performance versus commitment.andP;  While it is true that last year,we had positive revenue growth within the United States for the first time inthree years, we did not, for a number or reasons including market softness,do as well as we had expected.andP;  Therefore, compensation at many executiveslevels was less than it would have been if the firm's performance hadexceeded our commitment.andP;  In Akers' case, the buck stops with him and theadjusted compensation simply reflects the firm's performance.&quot;andM;(Barbara E.
