(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A weekend rally attracted more than 2,000opponents of the Chippewa tribe's court-affirmed treaty rights onfishing, and organizers angry over what they see as unfairtreatment of non-Indian fishermen vowed to disrupt the tribe'supcoming spearfishing season.   ``We will take whatever steps are necessary to hinder, minimizeor stop the terrible injustice granted by our liberal judges,'' AlSoik, of Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin, said at Saturday's rally.   ``We have organized lake watch groups to coordinate our effortsso we can have the maximum amount of people at each spearingsite,'' Soik added.   Chippewas claim that in the Treaty of 1854, in which they cededland to the federal government, they retained the right to hunt,spear fish and gather wild grain in northern Wisconsin, even offtheir reservations.   Federal courts have agreed, and a recent ruling said the tribecan regulate its own season within certain conservation guidelines.   Quotas announced by the tribe Wednesday, including ones set at100 percent of the number of walleyes biologists say can be safelytaken from 14 lakes, mean non-Indian sports angling will berestricted on some lakes to catch-and-release or a lower bag limit,state officials have said.   In addition, non-Indian anglers are not permitted to use spearsto catch prized game fish such as the walleye. They must use theless efficient bait and tackle method.   This will be the fifth year that tribal members have spearedfish off reservation. Past seasons have been marked by noisyprotests at the lakes, some name-calling and rock-throwing and afew arrests.   Several dozen tribal members and treaty supporters listened tothe rally.   Tom Maulson, a Lac du Flambeau Chippewa tribal judge andspearfishing organizer, said the tribe adheres to court rules andbiologists' advice about the number of fish that can be speared.   ``I see people up there wanting our blood,'' Maulson said,referring to the protesters. ``There's a lot of hate signs upthere.''   Saturday's rally, organized by Soik's group and another callingitself Protect Americans Rights and Resources, was disrupted byboos when two women carrying signs in support of the treaty rightsstood in front of the American flag by a platform where the treatyopponents were speaking.   One of the women did not leave when police approached. OneidaCounty District Attorney Brian Maloney said she was arrested fordisorderly conduct.   Police estimated the crowd at more than 2,000. More than twodozen police officers from throughout northern Wisconsin patrolledthe area.   William H. Covey, president of the Citizens for Equal RightsAlliance based in Montana, said fights over Indian treaty rightsfor land, water and fish and game also were under way in NewMexico, New York, Washington, South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska andIdaho.</TEXT></DOC>
