Alfredo Cesar, a member of the Contra directorate, said Thursdaythe administration will begin consultations with the Congress``very soon'' on a new assistance package.   No decision has been made on requesting military aid as part ofa package because it is not clear whether Congress would go along,Cesar said. On Feb. 3, the House defeated by eight votes an aidrequest that included $3.5 million for military equipment.   An administration official, insisting on anonymity, confirmedCesar's account, saying a decision has been made to seek renewedfunding for the Contras but the details ``are completely up in theair.''   Cesar said: ``What that package will contain, the amount, it'sstill open to discussions up here in Washington.   ``There is no fixed date (for a vote) but it's going to be soon,very soon and active discussions of that will start next week.''   He said he wants any aid package to last until next February orMarch to insulate the Contra issue from the emotions of the fallpresidential election campaign.   Cesar made it clear the rebels want a renewal of military aidbecause the Sandinista government, he said, has been receiving anaverage of $40 million a month worth of lethal equipment from theSoviet Union since Jan. 1.   This has put the rebels at a severe disadvantage in peacenegotiations with the Sandinistas, he said. At the same time, headded, the rebels ``do not want to restart the war'' and plan toask Central American governments to bring diplomatic pressure tobear on the Sandinistas to support a peaceful settlement.   Cesar spoke to reporters after he and his colleagues met withVice President George Bush, National Security advisor Colin Powelland Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. The rebeldelegation met with members of Congress on Wednesday.   The decision on whether to include military aid as part of apackage apparently will hinge on the administration's ability topersuade Congress that the Sandinistas are to blame for the failurelast week of peace talks in Managua.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Tuesday the talks madeplain the Sandinistas' unwillingness to fulfill their statedcommitment to create democracy in Nicaragua.   But Sandinista officials have said that the Contras sabotagedthe talks by introducing demands which were both new and ``absurd''during the final hours of the negotiations last Thursday.   As part of an interim cease-fire agreement signed by the Contrasand the Sandinistas last March 23, the rebels are entitled toreceive food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies from outsidesources.   Congress approved $17 million in such aid a week later,desginating that the money be obligated by Sept. 30. Outsidemilitary aid to the rebels was barred under the agreement.   When the humanitarian aid measure was approved by the House,Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, promised not to stand in the way ofany subsequent military aid proposal if the Sandinista-Contra peacetalks collapse.   But Wright has indicated that he no longer feels bound by thatpledge because of a Republican proposal on May 26 to allow the CIAto use contingency funds in support of the Contras. That bid wasrejected 214-190.   On Tuesday, Wright said he would oppose any new military aidrequest. But Cesar said he has the impression that congressionalsentiment has been shifting in support of the rebels since thebreakdown of the peace talks.</TEXT></DOC>
