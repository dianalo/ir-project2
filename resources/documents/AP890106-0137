PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two hundred works of avant-garde artist KazimirMalevich, long banned because they didn't meet the official idea ofart, were displayed Friday in Moscow's first show in decades devotedto the artist.   ``Today is our holiday,'' Yuri Korolyev, director of Moscow'sTretyakov Gallery told a news conference before the opening the showat the museum's exhibition hall along the Moscow River.   Malevich's avant-garde style clashed with the officially approvedsocialist realism, which Soviet officials counted on to inspirepeople to support their new political and economic system.   Museum officials said many of the paintings and graphics neverhad been displayed in the Soviet Union. In recent years, severalpaintings have been shown in exhibits of avant-garde art of the1920s and 1930s permitted in the freer atmosphere under PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev.   Included in the exhibit put together by several Soviet museumsand the Stedelijk Museum of Amsterdam is Malevich's ``BlackSuprematist Square,'' his most famous work painted in 1914-15, whichis in the Tretyakov collection.   The painting of a large black square surrounded by a white bordershowed many cracks, and museum officials said it was too delicate tobe moved from Moscow. Like almost 90 percent of the works, it hasbeen presevered for decades by Soviet curators who could not displayit.   Malevich's theory of suprematism says that a painted shape is notdevired in any way from the outside world, but is its own, uniquecreation.   There are a variety of suprematist works of geometric shapes andvarious colors that are placed on the canvas in no clear relation toeach other. No effort is made to give them a three-dimensionaleffect.   Most of the canvases are white with geometric designs in basicshades of black, red, yellow, green or purple. The black square isconsidered the ultimate suprematist work because it has absorbed allprevious painted images.   The Tretyakov Gallery organized an exhibit of Malevich's works in1929, but gallery officials said that was the last one devoted toMalevich until Friday.   The exhibit includes works that embrace three decades and a widevariety of styles, from his early impressionist paintings, cubistworks, a series of suprematist paintings following the originalblack square, and portraits painted from 1927 until his death in1935.   Even though the works included in the exhibit are 60 years old orolder, Korolyev predicted they would ``play a big role in thecontinuation of Soviet art.''   Avant-garde artists of the 1920s were part of a ``greatexperiment'' and carried with them the ``great culture of the past''which contemporary Soviet artists will be able to draw upon, hesaid..   Malevich was born in 1878 in Kiev to Polish parents. Wim Beeren,director of the Stedelijk Museum, said he knew two other Sovietmasters of that period, Vasily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall, but didnot get along with either. He taught for two years at an art schoolfounded in Vitebsk, Byelorussia, founded by Chagall, but was forcedto leave because of dislike for his teaching system.   An exhibition of Chagall's paintings was held in the Soviet Unionin 1987, and several remain on display at the Tretyakov Gallery.Museum officials said the exhibition of Malevich's works will befollowed by a Kandinsky exhibit.   Stanislav Ivanitsky, director of the Tretyakov's Soviet PaintingDepartment, said that while the Soviet Union retains the majority ofMalevich's work, some of the most important paintings are outsidethe country.   Faced with indifference to his suprematist works in the SovietUnion, he took an exhibit of about 30 paintings to Berlin and Warsawin 1927, and left them there. Beeren said seven smaller worksdisappeared during the years of Nazi rule, but that his museumacquired the rest in 1958. It is those paintings his museumcontributed to the exhibit.   The Soviet Culture Ministry sold two of Malevich's suprematistworks to private collectors in the West in the 1970s. Ivanitsky saidmuseum officials still were upset about the sale.   Malevich changed his style after returning from Berlin and beganpainting colorful portraits of peasants, workers and sportsmen, manyof them without faces. He never offered an explanation for changinghis style, and the question still is debated by art experts.   The exhibit was organized by the Stedelijk Museum and Soviet artofficials beginning in January 1988, and was shown in Leningradbefore moving to Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
