(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Kennedy's moderate responseduring the Cuban missile crisis was perceived instead as ``a virtualdeclaration of war'' by the Soviets, and Premier Nikita Khruschevbacked down from the brink for unexpected reasons, scholars now say.   Newly declassified documents indicate that luck, as well asskill, played a great role in resolving the world's last majornuclear crisis 27 years ago, Soviet and American experts at HarvardUniversity said Wednesday.   Kennedy and Khrushchev made key decisions based on seriousmisperceptions and faulty intelligence, which, however, may havehelped to resolve the crisis as well as to start it, said Graham T.Allison, dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.   ``Looking at it in retrospect, with all the new information, Istill give high marks to President Kennedy and ... also, perhapssurprisingly, to Khrushchev, for the degree of control they tried toexercise,'' said Allison, author of ``Essence of Decision,'' one ofthe authoritative books on the crisis.   ``But nonetheless, it is now clear that there was a greatcomponent of good fortune. It was a combination of extraordinaryskill, extraordinary courage and equally extraordinary good luckthat permitted us to avoid catastrophe,'' he said.   Harvard researcher James T. Blight said the documents, examinedduring two recent international conferences, demonstrate that theSoviets knew about U.S. covert operations to destabilize the Cubanregime.   The Soviets had put the missiles in Cuba mainly because theybelieved a full-scale Marine invasion was likely, said Blight,co-author of a new book, ``On The Brink: Americans and SovietsReexamine the Cuban Missile Crisis.''   Kennedy and his advisers believed that setting up a navalblockade was ``a relatively mild response'' to the missiles thatwould help defuse the crisis by rendering an invasion unnecessary.   ``They had no idea that the way that blockade would be perceivedin Moscow was as a prelude to an invasion and a virtual declarationof war,'' Blight said.   Indeed, the documents reveal that an enraged Nikita Khrushchevordered Soviet ships to steam through the U.S. blockade, but theorder was reversed by Anastas Mikoyan, the first deputy Sovietpremier, just hours before a military confrontation would haveoccurred.   It remains unclear whether Mikoyan circumvented the decision onhis own or obtained Khrushchev's permission to change it.   Allison said it now appears that Khrushchev gave in partlybecause he had received an urgent message from Castro, dictated froma bunker, saying an American military attack was imminent.   A Soviet general, Dmitri A. Volkogonov, also advised that anattack was coming, which turned out not to be true, said Allison,author of ``Essence of Decision,'' a classic 1971 study of thecrisis.   The crisis flared on Oct. 15, 1962, when a high-flying AmericanU-2 spy plane photographed the installation of nuclear-tipped SovietSS-4 and SS-5 missiles in Cuba. Kennedy deliberated secretly withhis aides for a week before announcing a naval quarantine of Cubaand a demand that the Soviets withdraw the missiles.   The world sat glued to television sets and radios as Soviet shipssteamed toward the blockade and what seemed to be an inevitablemilitary confrontation. But the Soviet ships stopped short, and theSoviets and Americans came to peaceful terms.   The historical re-examination, organized by the Kennedy School,included a reunion of former Kennedy advisers on Hawks Cay, Fla., inMarch 1987; a conference of Soviet and American experts andofficials at Harvard in October 1987; and a second conference thatincluded Cuban officials last month in Moscow.   Among the other revelations it has produced:   _U.S. intelligence estimates of Soviet and Cuban troop strengthwere way off. According to Cuban Politburo member Jorge Risquet,270,000 troops were ready to go to war, including 42,000 Sovietsoldiers _ four times the U.S. estimate at the time.   _Cuban leader Fidel Castro may have asked the Soviets to launch apre-emptive nuclear attack. Sergei Khrushchev, son of the formerSoviet leader, reportedly described Castro's request in privateconversations at the Moscow conference but has since denied he saidsuch a thing.   _Soviet and Cuban leaders believed a U.S. invasion was imminentbefore the missiles were installed. U.S. officials, including formerSecretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and former National Securityadviser McGeorge Bundy, have said the United States had no suchplans although a recently declassified memo indicates there werecontingency plans set.   ``In the analyses at the time and ever since, we thought the onlyreal reason for their putting missiles in Cuba was to put theAmerican homeland at risk and change the strategic balance _ and thedefense of Cuba was regarded as a kind of hoked-up piece ofpropaganda,'' said Blight.</TEXT></DOC>
