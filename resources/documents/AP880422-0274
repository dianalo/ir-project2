Iacocca last year asthe nation's highest-paid boss, according to a list compiled byBusiness Week.   Jim P. Manzi, the 36-year-old chairman of Lotus, made $26.3million in salary, bonuses and stock options during 1987, toppingthe $17.9 million taken home by Iacocca, who had been the top-paidexecutive of 1986, the magazine said Thursday.   Figures were compiled for the annual ``Executive CompensationScoreboard'' being published in Business Week's May 2 edition.   The list, which covers 339 companies, shows that with long-termcompensation the average chief executive's total pay jumped 48percent in 1987 to $1.8 million, one of the largest singleincreases ever.   Business Week attributed the gains largely to stock options thatwere exercised prior to the Oct. 19 market crash.   Excluding long-term pay, the average chief executive's salaryand bonus rose 8 percent to $975,617, much less than the 18 percentaverage increase in 1986 and slightly below the 8.6 percent thatmost managers settled for, the magazine said.   The third-highest paid executive was Paul Fireman, chairman ofrunning shoe company Reebok International Ltd., who collected atotal of $15.4 million.   Two of the highest-paid bosses worked for the same company,Waste Management Inc. No. 4, President Phillip B. Rooney, collected$14.3 million, while No. 6, Donald F. Flynn, senior vice president,collected $13.2 million.   In a separate analysis of the relationship between pay andcompany performance over a three-year period, Business Week saidthe executives who delivered the most to shareholders were RobertA. Swanson, chairman of Genentech, Inc., and Richard G. Cline,chairman of Nicor Inc.   Swanson was credited with giving shareholders of the innovativebiotechnology company the largest return in stock appreciation anddividends for the least pay in the past three years. Cline wascredited with earning the least relative to the profitability ofhis company, a natural gas utility.   Business Week said the worst performers were Iacocca and John F.McGillicuddy, head of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.   Iacocca's pay was the highest relative to Chrysler's return toshareholders, while McGillicuddy earned the most measured againstthe bank's weak financial performance due to hard hit by ThirdWorld loans.   Some bosses who lost their jobs were big winners because ofso-called ``golden parachute'' severance awards they had negotiated.   A separate list of the largest severance packages was led byTerrence A. Elkes, ex-chairman of Viacom Inc., who got $25 millionafter a takeover of his company by National Amusements Inc.   No. 2 was Robert Fomon, former chairman of E.F. Hutton GroupInc., who got $16.6 million after the company was acquired byShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
