After bringing its fast food to most other corners of the world, McDonald's Corp. plans to set up its golden arches next year in Moscow, opening a 650-seat restaurant on Gorky Street near the Kremlin.    Under a joint-venture agreement signed Friday between McDonald's Canadian subsidiary and Moscow's City Council, as many as 20 McDonald's restaurants will be opened in the city, and the two partners will operate a food-processing and food-distribution center to supply them.    One or two restaurants, including one for tourists that will accept only foreign currency, will be opened shortly after the first one, which will take rubles. A Big Mac hamburger (bolshoi being the Russian for big) will cost about two rubles ($3).    George A. Cohon, president and chief executive officer of McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd., said the company is also negotiating with authorities in Soviet Estonia to set up restaurants.    He declined to give financial details of the Moscow venture, except to say that McDonald's of Canada will own 49% of the equity and provide most of the food-processing equipment. Farms in the Moscow area are to provide most of the raw materials, such as beef and potatoes.    McDonald's appears to have found a way to work with tough provisions in Soviet joint-venture law that limit repatriation of profits in hard currency. Many Western companies have been put off by the difficulty of converting ruble profits into dollars, pounds or marks. Without giving details, Mr. Cohon and Soviet officials said McDonald's will have a ruble account in the Soviet Union to pay for other projects such as hotels or goods for export.    &quot;We're sure that as we develop the organization, we'll be able to find products that can be exported and sold for hard currency, &quot; Mr. Cohon said.    The joint venture marks the end of 12 years of talks that began in 1976 prior to the Olympic Games in Montreal, Mr. Cohon said. After an abortive attempt to open in Moscow for the 1980 Olympics there, talks began in earnest in the early 1980s.    Soviet officials said they hoped to gain expertise in food processing from the venture. They also said it would be good for Russian farmers to be forced to meet McDonald's quality requirements.    Mr. Cohon said McDonald's will train Soviet staff and won't allow standards to slip. &quot;A Big Mac will taste the same in Moscow as it does in Toronto, Tokyo or Rio,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
