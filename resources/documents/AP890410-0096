Federal prosecutors say defendant Elke Falk passed sensitive andsecret documents to the KGB Soviet intelligence service between1975 and 1985.   Ms. Falk, 44, said she began spying after falling in love withGerhard Thieme, who prosecutors say worked for the KGB. She saidThieme persuaded her to spy for him while the two were vacationingin communist East Germany.   Testifying before the Northrhine-Westphalia State Supreme Courtin Duesseldorf, she said she delivered Thieme documents about NATOtroop maneuvers in West Germany.   Ms. Falk told the court ``money played no role whatsover'' inher spying activities. She said she instead hoped for a ``commonfuture with Gerhard.''   Court documents say she was paid about $270 on severaloccasions, but even prosecutors have not described her motives interms of greed.   She formerly worked for the state secretary of the federalChancellery and also held posts in the federal transportation andeconomic development ministries.   Prosecutors said she gave the KGB copies of Cabinet and SecurityCouncil minutes and also provided information on briefings compiledby the West German intelligence services.   Investigators said the documents contained information onnational defense and security strategy and foreign policy questions.   Ms. Falk testified that she began spying after meeting GerhardThieme through a personal advertisement in a newspaper.   She said that at the time she worked in the West Germanchancellor's office and she had to ``overcome many scruples'' inorder to get herself to meet Thieme's requests.   The indictment alleges Ms. Falk used a miniature camera in acigarette lighter to copy documents she smuggled out of governmentoffices in a shopping bag fitted with a secret compartment. She hidfilm from the camera in a specially-designed can of hair spray andin a plant watering can, the indictment said.   Court officials said 18 witnesses are to testify at the trial,which is expected to last 12 days. She could receive up to 10 yearsin prison.   Ms. Falk has been in custody since March 1988.   West Germany is periodically rocked by discoveries thatcommunist agents have infiltrated government positions.   Willy Brandt was forced to resign as chancellor in 1974 afterone of his top aides, Guenter Guillaume, was unmasked as an EastGerman agent. Guillaume was sentenced to 13 years in prison butreleased after six years in a spy swap with East Germany.   Another famous spying case resulted in an eight-year sentence inAugust 1987 for Margaret Hoeke, a former secretery for five WestGerman presidents who also said she passed state secrets to a KGBagent out of love for the man.</TEXT></DOC>
