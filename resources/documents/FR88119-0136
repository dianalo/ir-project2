General Policies</ITAG>Because of the existing statutory criteria and a Congressional prohibitionagainst terminating eligibility, areas containing approximately 90 percentof the U.S. population are eligible for EDA assistance, which in FY 1987totaled less than $200 million. Priority consideration for funding willbe given only to those projects having exceptional potential to benefitareas experiencing or threatened with the most severe economic distress.EDA is particularly interested in projects located in areas recognizedby state and local governments as enterprise zones, especially projectsin rural enterprise zones.Distress may exist in a variety of forms, including exceptionally highunemployment rates, extremely low income levels, abnormally large concentrationsof low income families, particularly low labor force participation rates,unusually large numbers (or high rates) of business failures or farm loanforeclosures, high farm credit delinquencies, sudden major layoffs and/orplant closures, and drastically reduced tax bases. Potential applicantsare responsible for demonstrating to EDA, through the provision of statisticsand other appropriate information, the nature and level of the distresstheir efforts are intended to alleviate. In the absence of evidence ofexceptionally high levels of distress, EDA funding is unlikely. In consideringproposals to benefit severely distressed areas, EDA will give special considerationto those that address the needs of rural communities, particularly aiddirected toward the economic diversification of such areas.EDA expects substantial state and local support for proposed projects.Proposals that do not provide evidence of strong state and local leadershipand financing are unlikely to receive EDA aid.In the case of projects involving construction, EDA expects constructionto be initiated and completed in a timely manner. Applicants are expectedto anticipate predictable delays such as those caused by normal weatherconditions, legal complications, community disputes, land acquisition,etc., and account for them in developing project schedules. Projects whichare likely to encounter significant delays will normally not be given favorableconsideration. Projects that experience unreasonable delays following EDAapproval may be terminated and the funds deobligated. These policies areconsistent with EDA's objective of supporting activities that can beginto benefit local economies as soon as possible, thereby meeting the urgentdevelopment needs identified by project applicants. EDA staff expects thoseresponsible for developing and managing projects to maximize the impactof the public funds by preparing and implementing projects as thoroughlyand expeditiously as possible.EDA funding will not be used directly or indirectly to assist employerswho transfer one or more jobs from one area to another. EDA nonrelocationrequirements (13 CFR 309.3) apply to grants involving construction, rehabilitationor repair, and other financial assistance under Titles I, II, IV, IX, andsection 301(f) of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965,as amended, PWEDA (Pub. L. 89-136; 42 U.S.C. 3121-3246h).Applicants who have delinquent accounts receivable with the Departmentof Commerce will not receive new awards until these debts have been paidor arrangements to pay them have been approved by the Department of Commerce.Applicants may be subject to a pre-award accounting system survey by theDepartment of Commerce's Office of Inspector General, and fund recipientsmay be subject to audits or other inspections by the same office.Applicants eligible for assistance because of membership in an economicdevelopment district must be members in good standing and active participantsin the district economic development planning process.EDA staff will evaluate applications for conformance with published statutory,regulatory and policy requirements. Applications proposed for funding underthese programs are subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372,``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.''An invitation to submit a formal application does not assure EDA funding.Unsuccessfull applicants will be notified of the status of their applicationswhen all of EDA's funds for the program to which they have applied havebeen awarded.The following material describes other policies and procedures associatedwith each of EDA's programs.     <ITAG tagnum="85">II. Program: Planning Assistance for Economic Development Districts,Indian Tribes, and Redevelopment Areas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: 11.302 Economic Development_Supportfor Planning Organizations)</ITAG>SummaryFunds under the District, Indian and Area Planning Program are awardedto defray administrative expenses in support of the economic developmentplanning efforts of Economic Development Districts (Districts), RedevelopmentAreas (Areas) and Indian Tribes.

Program: University Center Projects</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: 11.303 Economic Development_TechnicalAssistance)</ITAG>SummaryFunds for basic university center projects are used as seed money to helpselected colleges and universities mobilize their own and other resourcesto assist in the economic development of distressed areas. The effortsof university centers should focus on helping public bodies, nonprofitorganizations and businesses plan and implement activities designed togenerate jobs and income. In addition, funds may be used for projects whichpromote the goals of the University Center Program in other ways. Supportfor these types of projects is authorized under section 301(a) of the PublicWorks and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3151(a).EligibilityEligible applicants for university center grants and cooperative agreementsare public and private colleges and universities, associations representingsuch institutions, and other organizations with expertise in UniversityCenter Program issues.Program ObjectiveThe objective of these projects is to enable colleges and universitiesto contribute to overall economic development by using their resourcesto provide technical assistance that will alleviate or prevent conditionsof excessive unemployment or underemployment and problems of distressedpopulations in individual states or sub-state areas.Funding AvailabilityFunds in the amount of $4.790 million are available for university centerprojects. Congress has directed that a total of $0.250 million be obligatedas a direct grant ``without any further requirement or delay'' for theCenter for International Trade Development at Oklahoma State University.Approval of this grant would reduce the university center funds availablefor the region in which this project is located.Funding InstrumentUniversity center project funds will be awarded through grants and cooperativeagreements to cover a portion of project costs. The amount covered willnot exceed 75 percent of proposed project costs. In the case of universitycenter basic grants, the following policies regarding local share apply:1. As announced in November 1985, university centers initially funded priorto FY 1986 (October 1, 1985) which continue to receive EDA support must,if funds are made available by Congress, gradually increase their shareto match the EDA grant dollar-for-dollar by FY 1990. At least half of thelocal share must be in cash. Centers which do not demonstrate progressin this regard may not continue to receive EDA funding.2. University centers initially funded in or after FY 1986 which continueto receive EDA support must, provided funds are made available by Congressafter FY 1988, provide a minimum of $33,334 in the first year, $45,000in the second year, $60,000 in the third year, $80,000 in the fourth year,$100,000 in the fifth year, $125,000 in the sixth year, and $140,000 inthe seventh and final year. At least half of the local share must be incash.Project DurationGrants and cooperative agreements will be for the period of time requiredto complete the scope of work. Generally this will not exceed twelve months.Selection CriteriaIn judging proposals from existing and potential university centers forbasic grants, EDA will consider whether the proposed center programs:1. Serve areas of significant economic distress;2. Address the development needs of the service area;3. Complement the activities of other organizations engaged in economicand business development (where applicable, the proposal must identifyhow it differs from the services provided by a local Small Business DevelopmentCenter, Trade Adjustment Assistance Center (TAAC) or a Minority BusinessDevelopment Center);4. Possess the commitment, as evidenced by financial support and otherresources, of the university leadership at the highest levels to the missionand purpose of the university center;5. Possess the capacity to provide the proposed technical and other typesof assistance to jurisdictions and organizations within the service area;and6. Complement and support the local, regional or state economic developmentstrategies in the service area. EDA staff will also consider the followingfactors in evaluating proposals for basic grants from potential centers:1. The extent to which the center proposes to serve the economic developmentneeds of economically distressed jurisdictions and community-based organizations.2. The presence of another EDA-funded center in the state. 3. The presence of an SBA- or MBDA-funded center or a TAAC in the servicearea. Proposals will also be judged on the quality of the proposed work programand the qualifications of the applicant to carry out that work program.Proposals for other projects that meet the goals of the University CenterProgram will be judged on similar factors. These include the potentialimpact of the project on distressed areas, the quality of the proposedwork program, and the qualifications of the applicant to carry it out.Depending on the availability of funds, EDA may hold a periodic competitionfor short-term (one to three year) incentive grants. This competition willbe open to all currently and previously funded centers, except those whichreceived initial funding in the previous year and those whose funding wasdiscontinued because of poor performance. Funding Policy For centers judged to performing satisfactorily and if funds are made availableby Congress, EDA's policy is to provide basic support of $100,000, annually,for five years and $50,000, annually, for the sixth and seventh years.No basic funds are provided after the seventh year of EDA support. For centers initiated prior to FY 1982 (October 1, 1981), EDA's fundingwill be reduced in FY's 1988, 1989, and 1990 by 20, 40, and 50 percent,respectively, from the FY 1987 funding level. No funding will be providedin FY 1991. Exceptions to these policies may be made in unusual circumstances,such as when no other qualified institution exists to provide servicesto an area with extreme economic distress. Proposal Submission Procedures <ITAG tagnum="81">A.

Program: Research and Evaluation Projects </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: 11.312 Economic Development_Researchand Evaluation Program) </ITAG>Summary Funds under the Research and Evaluation Program are used to support studiesthat will increase knowledge about the causes of economic distress andapproaches to alleviating such problems. This program is authorized undersection 301(c) of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965,as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3151(c). Eligibility Eligible applicants are private individuals, partnerships, corporations,associations, colleges and universities, and other suitable organizations.Project Objective The objectives of section 301(c) grants and cooperative agreements arethe following: 1. To determine the causes of unemployment, underemployment, underdevelopment,and chronic depression in various areas and regions of the Nation. 2. To assist in the formulation and implementation of national, state,and local programs that will raise employment and income levels and otherwiseproduce solutions to problems resulting from the above conditions. 3. To evaluate the effectiveness of programs, projects, and techniquesused to (a) alleviate economic distress; and (b) promote economic development.Funding Availability Funds in the amount of $1.210 million are available for this program. Fundswill be used for projects selected through the application procedures citedbelow and for EDA-initiated solicitations. Funding Instrument EDA will provide grants and cooperative agreement awards covering up to100 percent of project costs. Project Duration Assistance under this program will normally be for a period of up to 15months. Selection Criteria EDA will use the following criteria to evaluate research and evaluationproposals: 1. Suitability of the subject. 2. Potential usefulness of the research to state and local economic developmentpractitioners. 3. General quality and clarity of the proposal. 4. Soundness and completeness of the research methodology. 5. Qualifications of principal investigator(s) and, where appropriate,performing organization(s). 6. Previous performance of principal investigator and/or performing organizationon EDA-funded projects (i.e., the quality and timeliness of prior work).7. Total cost, and value of product in relation to cost. 8. Ability to be completed in no more than 12 to 15 months. EDA is interestedin receiving proposals dealing with: 1. Employment and unemployment; 2. Income and poverty; 3. Rural and other nonmetropolitan economic development; 4. Regional and local growth; 5. Industrial location; 6. Job creation methods; 7. State and local economic development efforts; 8. Private sector economic development efforts; 9. Developmental effects of public works and other infrastructure; 10. Capital markets and development finance, particularly non-Federal sourcesof economic development financing; 11. Industrial competitiveness; 12. Minority business and minority jobs; 13. Productivity and technology; and 14. Non-Federally funded financing proposals for economic development.Requested grants and awards should be for specific, well-defined, onetimeresearch projects. EDA research grants are not intended for support ofcontinuing programs (ongoing research programs, publication and informationprograms, periodic forecasts, etc.) or for nonresearch activities. Someresearch proposals deal with or involve samples drawn from only one partof the United States. EDA normally prefers research that is not limitedin geographic scope or that at least covers a very large multistate region,as opposed to research covering (in declining order of preference) a smallregion, a state, a multicounty area, or a single city or county. EDA preferscause-and-effect research and descriptive analyses to theoretical studies,modeling (other than for hypothesis testing), and the like. Economic developmentplanning and technical assistance for specific places will not be fundedunder the Research and Evaluation Program; the Planning and Technical AssistancePrograms are for those purposes. Proposal Submission Procedures Potential applicants should submit a brief and concise proposal. Proposalsshould avoid long background discussions and literature surveys, but shouldbe reasonably detailed, particularly in explaining methodology. Each proposalshould include (1) a cover page giving a short descriptive project title,the name and address of the performing organization, the names and telephonenumbers of the project director and principal investigators, the projectduration, the amount of EDA funds requested, and the program (Researchand Evaluation) that would provide the funds; (2) a brief scope-and-objectivessection saying why the project is needed, giving its objectives, and providinga capsule description of the project; (3) a more detailed description ofthe project and its methodology; (4) a work plan showing different phasesof the project and their timing; (5) a detailed budget showing cost breakdowns,with EDA-funded and any non-EDA-funded costs presented in separate columnsand with the EDA-funded costs adding to the total shown on the cover page;(6) resumes for the project director and principal investigators; and (7)a corporate or institutional capability statement, where appropriate.

Program: Economic Adjustment Assistance (Title IX)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance No: 11.307 Special EconomicDevelopment and Adjustment Assistance Program_Long-Term Economic (LTED)and Sudden and Severe Economic Dislocation (SSED))</ITAG>Summary  Funds under the Economic Adjustment Program are used to assist areas experiencinglong-term economic deterioration (LTED) and areas threatened or impactedby sudden and severe economic dislocation (SSED). This program is authorizedunder Title IX of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965,as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3241-3245.Program ObjectiveThe LTED Program assists eligible applicants in implementing strategiesthat halt and reverse the long-term decline of their economies. Grantsfor Revolving Loan Funds (RLF) are usually provided under the LTED/RLFProgram.The SSED Program assists eligible applicants to respond to actual or threatenedmajor job losses (dislocations) and other severe economic adjustment problems.It is designed to help communities prevent a sudden, major job loss; toreestablish employment opportunities as quickly as possible after one occurs;or to meet special needs resulting from severe changes in economic conditions.SSED assistance is intended to respond to permanent rather than temporaryjob losses. Assistance may be in the form of a grant to develop a strategyto respond to the dislocation (Strategy Grant) or a grant to implementan EDA approved strategy (Implementation Grant).In light of the current high level of economic distress in rural areas,EDA is particularly interested in Title IX projects designed to mitigateserious rural economic adjustment problems. EDA is also interested in proposalsto help severely distressed areas with large minority populations. Funding AvailabilityFunds in the amount of $24.657 million are available for the Economic AdjustmentProgram in FY 1988. Of the amount, $12.454 million will be available forthe SSED Program and $12.203 million will be available to fund RLFs (LTED).Funding InstrumentTitle IX funds are awarded through grants which normally provide up to75 percent of the project cost. Acceptable source of the local share include,but are not limited to, local government general revenue funds; CommunityDevelopment Block Grant (CDBG) entitlement funds or balance of state awards;and other public and private donations. The full amount of the local share need not be in hand at the time of application;however, the applicant must have a firm commitment from identified source(s),and the funds must be readily available. The local share and any loan repaymentsmust not be encumbered in any way that would preclude their use as requiredby the grant agreement. The local share for the RLF Program must be incash. The local share for the SSED Program may be in cash and/or in-kind. Eligible ApplicantsEligible applicants within areas meeting the EDA eligibility criteria describedbelow include a redevelopment area or economic development district establishedunder Title IV of this Act, 42 U.S.C. 3161; an Indian tribe; a state; acity or other political subdivision of a state, or a consortium of suchpolitical subdivisions; a Community Development Corporation defined inthe Community Economic Development Act, 42 U.S.C. 9801; a nonprofit organizationdetermined by EDA to be the representative of a redevelopment area; theFederated States of Micronesia; and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.Eligible Areas<ITAG tagnum="81">A. LTED</ITAG>In order to receive priority consideration for funding under the LTED/RLFProgram, an area must be experiencing at least one of three economic problems;very high unemployment; low per capita income; or chronic distress (i.e.,failure to keep pace with national economic growth trends over the lastfive years). Eligibility is determined statistically. Further informationis available from EDA's Regional Offices.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. SSED</ITAG>In order to receive priority consideration for funding under the SSED Program,an area must show actual or threatened permanent job losses that exceedthe following threshold criteria, unless otherwise determined by the AssistantSecretary:1. For areas not in Metropolitan Statistical Areas:a. If the unemployment rate of the Labor Market Area exceeds the nationalaverage, the dislocation must amount to the lesser of two (2.0) percentof the employed population, or 500 direct jobs.b. If the unemployment rate of the Labor Market Area is equal to or lessthan the national average, the dislocation must amount to the lesser offour (4.0) percent of the employed population, or 1,000 direct jobs.2. For areas within Metropolitan Statistical Areas:a. If the unemployment rate of the Metropolitan Statistical Area exceedsthe national average, the dislocation must amount to the lesser of one-half(0.5) percent of the employed population, or 4,000 direct jobs.  b. If the unemployment rate of the Metropolitan Statistical Area is equalto or less than the national average, the dislocation must amount to thelesser of one (1.0) percent of the employed population, or 8,000 directjobs.  In addition, fifty (50) percent of the job loss must result from the actionof a single employer, or eighty (80) percent of the job loss must occurin a single industry classification (i.e., two digit SIC code).  In the case of a Presidentially declared natural disaster, the area eligibilitycriteria are waived. In other similarly exceptional circumstances, thecriteria may be partially waived at the discretion of the Assistant Secretary. Actual dislocations must have occurred within one year and threatened dislocationsmust be anticipated to occur within two years of the date EDA is contacted. Selection Criteria  Proposals will be evaluated based on conformance with statutory and regulatoryrequirements, the economic adjustment needs of the area, the merits ofthe proposed project in addressing those needs and the potential applicant'sability to manage the grant effectively.  <ITAG tagnum="81">A. LTED/RLF Selection Criteria  </ITAG>Key factors in EDA's selection of proposed LTED/RLF projects include: 1. <T3>Economic and Financial Needs of the Project Area. </T3>a. Areas withthe highest levels of economic distress (high unemployment, low per capitaincome, vacant plants, deteriorating infrastructure, and declining farmeconomy, etc.) will receive priority consideration.  b. Need for RLF financing will be evaluated based on the applicant's analysisof the local capital market and how clearly this analysis defines the financialproblems to be addressed by the RLF project.  c. Potential applicant's need for grant funds to carry out the projectwill be based on an assessment of its financial resources (e.g., budgetdeficit or surplus).  2. <T3>Objectives and Benefits of Proposed Projects. </T3>Priority will begiven to projects which can:  a. Stimulate private sector employment. The number and types of jobs tobe created/retained will be key factors in project selection along withthe job/cost ratio established for the RLF portfolio as a whole.  b. Target assistance to meet program objectives and to support specificeconomic adjustment activities planned or underway in the area, particularlythose identified in the OEDP, Title IX strategy, or other plans developedto deal with specific economic adjustment problems affecting the area.This may include target areas, industries, types of employers or othercriteria that maximize the impact of assistance on specific needs withinthe area.  c. Leverage higher ratios of private investment than the required minimumratio of two private sector investment dollars to one RLF dollar. (Note:the local share or other funds provided by the RLF to finance loans cannotbe counted as leveraged dollars.)  d. Direct new job opportunities to the long-term unemployed and underemployed. e. Assist minorities, women and members of other economically disadvantagedgroups in obtaining RLF loans.  f. Provide technical and management assistance for RLF borrowers, in additionto loan funds.  g. Use creative financing techniques to overcome specific gaps in the localcapital market.  h. Make loans on a timely basis. The implementation schedule for RLF projectswill normally require that RLF loans in the initial round be closed (andall EDA funds disbursed) within three years of grant approval with no lessthan 50 percent disbursed within eighteen months and 80 percent withintwo years.  i. Include a larger matching share than the required 25 percent or securecommitments for future funding from other private or non-Federal publicsources.  j. Coordinate activities with other economic development organizations,loan programs, employment training programs and private lenders in thearea.3. <T3>Effective Management of the RLF. </T3>EDA will also evaluate proposedprojects to determine that the RLF will be properly managed. Key factorsinclude: a. A strong and effective Loan Administrative Board with broad communityrepresentation, including appropriate public, private sector, minorityand women representation.  b. Staff capacity in program and policy development, finance, law, marketing,credit analysis, loan packaging, processing and servicing.  c. Efficient procedures for loan selection, approval, and servicing whichemphasize the economic development potential of loans as well as soundmanagement and financing practices.  d. A strategy for relending loan repayments which will ensure that theRLF revolves continuously and thus fulfills its purpose of creating jobsand stimulating economic activity on an ongoing basis.  e. Adequate resource to cover administrative costs of the RLF.  f. The potential applicant's experience and capacity for administeringeconomic and business loan programs. If the potential applicant has designatedanother organization to administer the project, EDA will evaluate the experienceand capacity of that organization, rather than the potential applicant. Nongovernment (excluding Economic Development Districts) organizationsseeking funds must be sponsored by the local or state government havingjurisdiction over the project area, and the sponsor must be willing toassume responsibility for operating the RLF should the nongovernment entityno longer be able to administer the project.  <ITAG tagnum="81">B. SSED Evaluation Criteria  </ITAG>Key factors in EDA's selection of proposed SSED projects include:  1. The severity of the dislocation as measured by, but not limited to,the following factors.  a. The degree to which the number of dislocated workers exceeds the eligibilitythreshold.  b. The proportion of the total job loss represented by a single employer.      c. The proportion of employment in a single industry classification representedby the firm(s) closing. d. The potential applicant's need for grant funds to carry out the projectbased on an assessment of its financial resources (e.g., budget deficitor surplus).2. The objectives and benefits of proposed activities as measured by theextent to which:a. <T3>For Implementation Grants. </T3>(1) Job creation or retention in thenear term is emphasized versus more long-term, general economic development.Projects likely to encounter delays, particularly in initiating or completingconstruction, will normally not be given favorable consideration.(2) The jobs to be created and/or retained are permanent, will directlybenefit the dislocated workers, and are new employment opportunities andnot transferred from one area of the United States to another.(3) The response to the problem is timely.(4) EDA assistance will be complemented by, or will complement, appropriatestate and local efforts, for example, training and job placement services,other Federal investments, such as Urban Development Action Grants, andprivate sector support.(5) The adjustment strategy and implementation activities proposed demonstratean appropriately creative approach to addressing the dislocation.(6) The cost per job created or retained is minimized.(7) In the case of a Revolving Loan Fund, the recycled loan proceeds generateeconomic development benefits.(8) The local share exceeds the required 25 percent.b. <T3>For Strategy Grants</T3>. (1) The applicant has demonstrated the capacityto manage the planning process and subsequent implementation activities.(2) The proposed scope of work is responsive to the problem.(3) The focus of the planning effort is on the generation of practicaland implementable solutions.(4) The local share exceeds the required 25 percent.Construction Project ImplementationAs indicated in the first section of this Notice, EDA expects constructionprojects to be initiated and completed in a timely manner in accordancewith the schedule agreed upon in the grant documentation. The recipientwill be responsible for promptly notifying EDA of any events that preventadherence to the approved schedule. The grantee must also provide an explanationof why the events were beyond its ability to predict or control and obtainEDA approval of changes in the schedule prior to proceeding with projectimplementation.EDA expects grantees to anticipate predictable delays (such as those causedby land acquisition problems, local financing requirements, acquisitionof state permits and approvals, normal weather conditions in area, andpublic objections to the project), and take them into account in preparingthe project schedule. Grantees who fail to comply with project schedulesmay be subject to grant suspension and/or termination.EDA will not provide additional funds to finance overruns that occur duringproject implementation.Proposal Submission ProceduresInterested parties should contact the Economic Development Representativefor the area or the appropriate EDA Regional Office for a proposal package.The EDA Regional Office can provide the name, address and telephone numberof the Economic Development Representative for the area. Project proposals,submitted by eligible entities, will be evaluated by EDA staff on the basisof:1. Conformance with the evaluation criteria mentioned above and statutory,regulatory and policy requirements.2.

Program: Public Works and Development Facilities Assistance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: 11.300 Economic DevelopmentGrants and Loans for Public Works and Development Facilities. 11.304 EconomicDevelopment Public Works Impact Program (PWIP)]</ITAG>SummaryFunds available under the Public Works Program are used to finance publicworks and development facilities that contribute to the economic developmentof depressed areas. EDA's public works expenditures are authorized by TitlesI and IV of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended(PWEDA), 42 U.S.C. 3131 and 42 U.S.C. 3171(a)(3)EligibilityEligible applicants under this program include any state, or politicalsubdivision thereof, Indian tribe, the Federated States of Micronesia,the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or private or public nonprofit organizationor association representing any redevelopment area or part therof, if theproject is located within an EDA-designated redevelopment area. Redevelopmentareas, other than those designated under the Public Works Impact Program,must have a current EDA-approved Overall Economic Development Program (OEDP).Political entities claiming eligibility under OEDPs developed by multicountyeconomic development organizations are expected to continue to participateactively in the organization. Further information on areas eligible forthis EDA program is available from EDA's Regional Offices.Program ObjectiveThe purpose of the Public Works Grant Program is to assist communitieswith the funding of public works and development facilities that contributeto the creation or retention of private sector jobs and to the alleviationof unemployment and underemployment. Such assistance is designed to helpcommunities achieve lasting improvement by stabilizing and diversifyinglocal economies, and improving local living conditions and the economicenvironment of the area. EDA emphasizes the alleviation of unemploymentand underemployment among residents of the project area as a primary focusof this program. In view of the current rural distress, applications fromrural communities will be reviewed with particular interest.Funding AvailabilityFunds in the amount of $126.460 million are available for this program.Congress has directed that a total of $6.500 million be obligated as directgrants ``without any further requirement or delay'' for the MississippiInstitute for Technology Development ($3.0 million); the University ofBridgeport; Connecticut ($2.5 million); and the City of Worcester and theWorcester Business Development Corporation, Massachusetts ($1.0 million).Approval of these grants would reduce the funds available for each of theregions in which these projects are located.Funding InstrumentEDA may provide grants with maximum EDA participation of 80 percent ofproject costs. On an average, EDA grants cover 50 percent of project costs.Applicants will be required to provide the local share from acceptablesources of the local share including, but not limited, to local governmentgeneral revenue funds; Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) entitlementfunds or balance of state awards; Farmers Home Administration loans; andother public and private donations.The local share need not be in hand at the time of application; however,the applicant must have a firm commitment from identified sources, andthe funds must be readily available. The local share must not be encumberedin any way that would preclude its use consistent with the requirementsof the grant agreement. Priority will be given to applications which maximizethe local share's percentage of the project cost. Supplementary grant assistanceto finance more than 50 percent of project costs will only be approvedby EDA for projects in areas of high distress. Decisions on such assistancewill be based on the nature of the project, the amount of fair user chargesor other revenues the project may reasonably be expected to generate andthe relative needs of the project (see 13 CFR 305.5).Selection CriteriaFor both regular public works projects and Public Works Impact Program(PWIP) projects, priority consideration will be given to those which arethe most competitive based upon the project selection criteria set forthbelow, that best meet the needs of eligible areas, and that are locatedin areas of severe economic distress.<ITAG tagnum="81">A.

Has substantial labor intensity, where labor intensity is the proportionof labor costs to the total project costs. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Industrial Park Projects </ITAG>Projects which will primarily serve an industrial park or site will beevaluated on such additional factors as: 1. A detailed analysis of existing industrial park capacity and utilization;occupancy rates for existing developed industrial acres currently availablewithin a 25-mile radius of the project site. For cities with populationsover 50,000, the prescribed area may be determined by an analysis of industrialsites within an established industrial area, which may be less than a 25-mileradius. Contact the Economic Development Representative for the area orthe appropriate EDA Regional Office for guidance. 2. Commitments in writing from identified tenants to locate in the industrialpark or site. Commitments must include description of the industry, thenumber of jobs created or saved, and an implementation schedule. 3.

Involve industrial parks where there is evidence of excessive vacanciesin existing developed industrial parks or sites in close proximity to theproposed project, unless there is evidence the proposed project is targetedto types of firms not readily accommodated or served by the existing industrialparks and firm commitments to locate in the industrial park exist; 10. Involve vocational-technical schools unless a direct link has beenestablished between the training curriculum and the needs of existing localemployers or those committed to locate in the labor market area; 11. Require a mortgage to be placed on the real property or the facilityto be constructed/improved with EDA funds; or 12.

EDA expects recipients to anticipate predictabledelays (such as those caused by land acquisition problems, local financingrequirements, normal weather conditions in the area, acquisition of statepermits and approvals, and public objections to the project), and to takethem into account in preparing the project schedule. Recipients who failto comply with project schedules may be subject to grant suspension and/ortermination. Under most circumstances, EDA will not provide additional funds to financeoverruns that occur during project implementation. <T3>Proposal Submission Procedures </T3>To establish the merits of project proposals, interested parties shouldfirst contact the Economic Development Representative for the area. TheEDA Regional Office can provide the name, address and telephone numberof the Economic Development Representative for the area who will providea preapplication form and arrange for conferences to discuss the proposal.EDA will screen proposals before inviting the submission of a formal application.Proposals will be evaluated based upon: 1. Conformance with statutory and other legal requirements and with theselection criteria mentioned above; 2. The merits of the proposal in addressing the relative economic developmentneeds of the eligible area; and 3. The availability of funds as allocated to the Regional Offices. Processing time for project proposals will depend on the completeness ofinformation provided in the preapplication form and supporting documentsat the time of submission. Project proposals that require additional informationfrom applicants or other sources will be returned to correct deficienciesand the official application receipt dates will be adjusted accordingly.Formal Application ProceduresFollowing a review of project proposals, EDA staff will invite entitieswhose projects are selected for funding consideration to submit formalapplications.Previous ApplicationsProject applications invited, but not funded in FY 1987, remain eligiblefor funding consideration. Those applications which were received by September30, 1987, will be processed and evaluated in accordance with the projectselection criteria published for FY 1987, current legal requirements, andEDA's revised nonrelocation policy as stated in 13 CFR 309.3, which waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 10, 1987.

Program: Guaranteed Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: 11.301 Economic Development_BusinessDevelopment Assistance)</ITAG>SummaryPursuant to Public Law 89-136 (42 U.S.C. 3142-3246(h)) (Act), EDA is preparedto guarantee up to eighty percent (80%) of the principal and interest ofloans to be made to private borrowers for the purchase of fixed assetsand/or for working capital purposes for projects located in areas eligiblefor EDA assistance. EDA loan guarantees are made available to help businessesexpand, establish, or maintain operations in both urban and rural eligibleareas throughout the Nation. Guarantees offered under this program aremade at the discretion of the Assistant Secretary for Economic Developmentbased upon data from the borrower and lender current at the time the guaranteeis offered.Preapplication ProceduresApplicants should contact the appropriate EDA Regional Office BusinessLoans Division to discuss their proposals. EDA staff will screen proposalsbefore inviting a formal application. Proposals will be evaluated basedupon conformance with the following:1. Statutory requirements contained in the Act;2. Regulatory requirements contained in 13 CFR Part 306 and 309; and restatedin this Notice; and 3. Provisions of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Revised CircularA-70, dated August 24, 1984 (A-70).OMB Circular A-70 (Revised) RequirementsAll loan guarantees must conform to the requirements of A-70, without exception.The most significant requirements of A-70 are as follows:1. Loans must be secured by first priority, unsubordinated liens on collateralhaving value in excess of the full amount of the loan.2. An annual guarantee fee, payable quarterly, equal to one-half percentof the outstanding EDA contingent liability will be charged. This fee issubject to change at any time prior to approval of a guarantee.3. Not more than eighty percent (80%) of the principal and the intereston a loan may be guaranteed.4. The lender must bear a significant portion of the risk of loss on theloan. No other security, guarantees, or any other arrangement that wouldnot inure ratably to EDA for that portion of the loan not guaranteed byEDA will be permitted.5. No loan directly involved with tax-exempt obligations, such as industrialrevenue bonds, will be guaranteed.Supplementary Information<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Amount of Funding Available</ITAG>EDA is authorized to commit up to $150 million to guarantee contingentliability for loan principal in FY 1988, which ends September 30, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Type of Financial Assistance</ITAG>EDA staff will consider proposals for the guarantee of loans made by privatelending institutions to private borrowers to finance the costs of fixedassets or for working capital purposes. EDA staff will not accept applicationsfor projects which involve real estate development for either investmentor speculation, or for the refinancing of current debt.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Who May Apply</ITAG>Formal applications will be invited by EDA staff only after review andacceptance of satisfactory project proposals. Applications will be acceptedonly from private lending institutions (the ``applicant'') for the guaranteeof loans to private business enterprises. EDA's relationship is essentiallywith the lender applicant, not the borrower.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Long-Term Employment</ITAG>EDA staff will seek to assist in the creation or retention of permanentprivate-sector jobs in EDA eligible areas. Accordingly, the project forwhich the applicant seeks financial assistance must be reasonably calculatedto provide more than a temporary alleviation of unemployment or underemploymentwithin the eligible area where the project is or will be located.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Repayment Ability</ITAG>The private lender and EDA must find that there is reasonable assuranceof repayment of the guaranteed loan.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. EDA Guarantee Required</ITAG>No loan will be guaranteed by EDA unless the application is supported byevidence that the financial assistance applied for is not otherwise availableto the prospective borrower from either private lenders without a guaranteeor from other Federal agencies on terms which, in the opinion of EDA, willpermit accomplishing the project. In the event the borrower is a largecorporation which would normally have funds available to finance the project,such corporation must certify that it would not locate the proposed projectwithin the EDA-designated area without the benefits of EDA's financialassistance.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. Relocation</ITAG>Nonrelocation requirements apply to guaranteed loans under section 202,Title II of PWEDA. EDA's regulations at 13 CFR 309.3 prohibit transferringjobs from one commuting area to another. Certificates of nonrelocationwill be required.General Conditions of Assistance<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Term of Loan</ITAG>The term of a guaranteed fixed asset loan cannot exceed the weighted averageestimated useful economic life of the project fixed assets, but in no eventcan the term of such a loan exceed twenty-five (25) years. The term ofa guaranteed working capital loan ordinarily may not exceed five (5) years,and the loan should be fully amortized during its term. EDA will not ordinarilyguarantee revolving-type or open-end working capital loans.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Guarantee Percentage and Interest Rate</ITAG>Pursuant to A-70, EDA may guarantee up to eighty percent (80%) of the facevalue of a loan. However, applicants requesting an eighty percent (80%)guarantee will be required to justify why a lesser guarantee percentagewould not be acceptable. As a general rule, EDA will not offer to guaranteesa loan in excess of the following percentage and interest rates:1. 80% guarantee_Lender prime rate plus 1.50%2. 75% guarantee_Lender prime rate plus 1.75%3. 70% guarantee_Lender prime rate plus 2.0%4. 60% guarantee_Lender prime rate plus 2.5%<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Guarantee Fee</ITAG>Pursuant to A-70, EDA staff will charge the lender an annual guaranteefee, payable quarterly, equal to one-half percent of the outstanding contingentliability. EDA staff reserves the right to change this fee at any timeprior to approval of the guarantee.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Application Fee</ITAG>EDA staff may change an application processing fee to cover the costs ofapplication processing and review.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Lender's Risk</ITAG>That portion of the loan not guaranteed by EDA must be at risk to the recipientthroughout the term of the loan. This precludes the recipient from obtainingany additional security, guarantee, or compensating balances to separatelysecure the unguaranteed portion of the loan. This does not preclude normalloan participation arrangements by the lender, provided that any such participationis acceptable to EDA. EDA staff will be obligated to deal only with therecipient, and all participants must be eligible as recipients.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Other Lender-Borrower Relationships</ITAG>When an recipient has other creditor/debtor relationships with the prospectiveborrower, EDA staff will seek assurances that these relationships willnot create conflicts with EDA's interest in the recipient's servicing ofthe loan for which a guarantee is sought. Ordinarily, EDA staff will notaccept an application from an applicant who has existing short-term revolvingworking capital financing extended to the borrower.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. EDA Investment Per Job</ITAG>EDA staff will consider only those projects that have an EDA investmentexposure of $20,000 or less per permanent job to be created or saved.<ITAG tagnum="81">H. Repayment Ability</ITAG>Only projects that demonstrate reasonable assurance of repayment are eligibleto receive EDA financial assistance. The applicant must demonstrate whyit is reasonably certain the borrower will be able to repay the loan. Asa minimum, the application must include:1. Applicant's normal detailed credit analysis, including a narrative discussionof company history, management, product, production capability, marketconditions, finances, collateral, and repayment ability (with ratio analysescompared to industry standards);2. Three (3) years' financial statements, audited and certified by a publicaccountant, if available, or certified by a responsible officer of theprospective borrower; if in operation less than three years, financialstatements since inception;3. Financial statements of the prospective borrower, current within ninety(90) days of the date of the application;4. Pro forma balance sheets, income and cash flow statements of the prospectiveborrower on a month-by-month basis for the first year after the loan ismade and on a quarterly basis for the next two (2) years; and 5. One copy of the proposed note and loan agreement between the applicantand the prospective borrower with attachments.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Adequate Collateral</ITAG>The lender must perfect and maintain perfected linen against and securityinterests in collateral adequate to permit full recovery of the loan inthe case of default by the borrower. Collateral must be of such naturethat repayment of the loan is reasonably assured when considered with theintegrity and ability of project management, soundness of the project andborrower's prospective earnings. The applicant must document why it isreasonably certain that adequate collateral coverage exists. Only projectsthat demonstrate that the full amount of the loan is covered exclusivelyby an unsubordinated first priority security interest on collateral offeredby the borrower will be considered. There will be no exceptions to thisrequirement. Proof and documentation of collateral coverage shall includebut not be limited to current appraisals as to the fair market and liquidationvalue of the collateral that will support the loan. If the purchase ofnew machinery and equipment constitutes all or part of the prospectiveproject cost, current cost data for such assets may be submitted in lieuof an appraisal.
