(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Relatives of Pan Am Flight 103victims organized a committee Sunday to push for a congressionalinvestigation of the flight's bombing and to step up airlinesecurity.   ``If we don't organize ourselves in an effective way ... it willbe very difficult to go forward,'' said Paul Hudson, an attorney andformer counsel to the New York State Crime Victims CompensationBoard who started the network.   Hudson's daughter, Melina, 16, was aboard the jetliner when itblew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, killing all 259aboard, including 35 students enrolled in a Syracuse Universityprogram, and 11 residents of Lockerbie.   ``We've come to assist each other in our grief,'' Hudson said.``We've come to try to insure that there are no more Flight 103disasters for the air and families.''   Seventy-five to 100 relatives, many with photographs of theirlost loved ones pinned to their chests, attended the meeting at arestaurant to form the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 committee.   Last week, officials announced that the terrorist's bomb whichdestroyed the Boeing 747 was traced to a portable radio stored amongthe luggage. The plane was en route from London to New York.   Besides giving support and aid to grieving relatives, thecommittee will push for a congressional investigation of thebombing, said Bill Ammerman, whose brother, Tom, was aboard Flight103.   Some committee members already have met with their locallawmakers, including U.S. Sens. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., Al D'Amato,R-N.Y., and Bill Bradley, D-N.J.   Airline security procedures have not improved enough since theexplosion, Hudson said. ``It is far less than what is required togive confidence in the security of the system,'' he said.   The group will campaign for stronger security measures, includinginstallation of devices that detect plastic explosives.   The families approved a resolution that calls for the resignationof Paul Bremer, U.S. ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism. Thegroup said Bremer should resign because he has said airplane flightcrews and passengers do not need to know about all bomb threats.   Bremer said earlier this month that the State Department willmake sure any airline travel warning issued to government employeesabout terrorist threats will also go to the general public.   He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee the American embassyin Moscow violated policy in posting a warning about Pan Americanflights from Frankfurt to the United States.   The warning, which was not made public, came eight days beforeFlight 103 was bombed.   ``It is not our policy to alert government officials and not thegeneral public to such a threat,'' Bremer said at the time. ``Thereis, and can be, no double standard.''   But Bremer said the threats should not be announced at all,because it would encourage ``copy-cat terrorist threats.''   The Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 committee want majorinternational airlines to make public their policies regarding bombthreats.</TEXT></DOC>
