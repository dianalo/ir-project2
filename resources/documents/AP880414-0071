They also said the Shiite Moslem gunmen rigged the doors of theKuwait Airways Boeing 747 with explosives.   One passenger who holds U.S. and Egyptian citizenship said hekept the hijackers from discovering his American passport.   Relatives, friends and Sheik Salem Al-Sabah, Kuwait's interiorminister, greeted the 12 released hostages when they arrived at theairport in Kuwait on Wednesday. The 12 were freed in Larnaca onTuesday before the hijackers took the jet to Algeria, the thirdstop in the ordeal that began April 5.   Thirty-two hostages remained aboard the jet, including threemembers of the extensive Kuwaiti royal family. They were held byabout eight hijackers.   Arab women ululated in celebration at the Kuwait airport whilewell-wishers pounded car roofs and shouted in joy as the 12 arrived.   Aboard their plane were coffins containing the bodies of twoKuwaitis, who were beaten, shot then dumped from the hijacked jetonto the tarmac in Larnaca.   The coffins _ draped in black, green and white Kuwaiti flags _were carried to ambulances whose lights flashed on the dimly-litrunway.   Those released included five Egyptians and three Jordanians inWestern-style dress and four Kuwaitis wearing white robes and Arabheaddresses. The director of Larnaca General Hospital, CostasMallis, said the 12 men were ``physically all right, sufferingmainly from fatigue.''   Adnan Rashid Majiki, a Kuwaiti in his 60s, said the hijackers``were six but in Mashhad they became seven.''   Kuwaiti news reports have quoted unidentified sources as sayingat least one additional hijacker joined the plane in Mashhad, Iran.   ``They changed the crew, you know, their team,'' passengerRamadan Ali told NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``One of them left ...and another two guys came over ... and they provided them with newweapons ... and bombs ... and ropes ... and explosives.''   Ali, who holds U.S. and Egyptian citzenship, said he hid hisAmerican passport in his briefcase.   He said the hijackers asked passengers ``if somebody wasstopping in America, or (was a) U.S. citizen. I told them I can'tafford it, you know it's very expensive to go to this country.''   ``I was scared ... very scared, because if they searched mybriefcase you know I would be the first one to get shot,'' Ali said.   ``Minute-to-minute I ... was expecting (the hijacker), you know,to grab me ... like (a) chicken from the chicken nest and kill meas he did, you know, those other two Kuwaiti guys,'' he said.   Another freed hostage said the hijackers questioned theircaptives about what kind of lives they led.   ``We were asked about our religion, and how many children wehad, and about our work,'' said Saleh Ibrahim Malak, a Kuwaiti inhis 30s. The hijackers had said they freed hostages who were pooror who had many children.   ``I saw explosives tied to the doors,'' Malak said. ``I sawstrings tied around the doors.''   The gunmen said repeatedly they were prepared to blow the planeup if 17 pro-Iranian Moslems jailed in Kuwait on terrorismconvictions weren't released. Kuwait has refused.   ``There were two handsome ones in their early 20s and two intheir 30s,'' Malak said.   An Egyptian, Sharif Mamdouh Badrawi, said the Koran, the Moslemholy book, helped him endure the ordeal. ``I feel as if I'm bornagain,'' he said. ``I read the entire Koran on the plane.''   Badrawi said scars on his hands were caused by a rope used totie them up, but ``despite the cuffs I could turn the pages of theKoran. They (gunmen) liked that and patted my shoulder.''   Mohammed Kamel Sayyid Rehan, 32, of Cairo, said: ``They used totell us, `We will either all die together or live together.'''   ``Yesterday, before they let us go, two hijackers appearedwearing napkins round their necks on which they had written,`Martyrdom Is Our Love.'''   Rehan said, ``I was hit on the face once when I locked the doorof the toilet, something they told us not to do.''   But he said one gunman joked with the hostages and offered themcigarettes.   Rehan said the more elderly hostages were treated kindly, and sowere three members of the Kuwaiti royal family _ Fadel KhaledAl-Sabah, a businessman in his 40s, and his sisters Ebtesam andAnware, who are in their 30s.   ``The royals were treated very well, especially the women,'' hesaid. ``But their brother is the one who looks broken downpsychologically.''   The released passengers were interviewed at the hospital or atthe airport.   The Kuwait Airways jumbo jet was hijacked April 5 with 112people aboard on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight and diverted to Iran. Itflew to Cyprus on Friday and then to Algiers on Tuesday night.</TEXT></DOC>
