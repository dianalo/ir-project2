The nuclear matrix model proposes thatthere is a fundamental nonchromatin infrastructure in the cell nucleusterms the in situ matrix. It is further postulated that the in situ matrixis interlinked with both chromatin and ribonucleoproteins and is an integralpart of the replicational, transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineryof the cell nucleus. Isolation of nuclear matrix structures from a widevariety of eucaryotic cells with structural properties anticipated forthis proposed in situ nuclear infrastructure has provided one line ofsupport for this hypothesis. The multitude of functionally related propertiesfound associated with isolated nuclear matrix systems has provided theother line. While the validity of the matrix model remains for futureresearch to determine, it is currently serving as a major stimulus forresearch in the cell nucleus field as well as providing a number of potentiallyimportant in vitro systems for investigating the correlations of nuclearstructure and function. In this chapter the nuclear matrix model is presentedand the properties of in situ and isolated nuclear matrix systems arecompared. This is followed by a brief review of one particular functionalproperty associated with isolated nuclear matrix systems: DNA replication.</TEXT></DOC>
