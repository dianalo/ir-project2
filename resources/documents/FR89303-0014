In this <T3>Reconsideration Order</T3> the Commission generally affirms its regulatoryprocedures. However, the Commission modifies the rate base treatment ofcertain items and provides clarification for others.In this <T3>Reconsideration Order </T3>the Commission has modified the requirementsfor the calculation of cash working capital (CWC). The Commission has decidedto permit all Class A carriers to compute their CWC by use of either fulllead-lag studies or the Simplified Formula Method outlined in andSection;65.820(d) of the Commission's rules. For Class B carriers the Commissionhas decided to permit three options. Class B carriers may elect to followthe Simplified Formula Method, perform a full lead-lag study or determinetheir CWC using an industry ``standard time period'' of lead or lag referredto as the Standard Allowance Method. The Standard Allowance Method, ascurrently set, permits a Class B carrier to include in the rate base astandard cash working capital allowance equal to 15 days of its cash operatingexpenses. The Commission has delegated the task of periodically reviewingand revising the standard allowance to the Chief of the Common CarrierBureau. Although the Commission is permitting carriers the flexibilityto choose between methods, carriers must advise the Commission of changesin CWC methods in future tariff filings and their reasons for such change.The Commission has decided that it will continue the long-standing policyof allowing carriers to add minimum bank balances and working cash advancesto their CWC determination. However, the Commission rejected the argumentsof those parties who wished to include ``non-cash'' items, such as depreciationand deferred taxes, in lead-lag studies. This <T3>Reconsideration Order</T3> reaffirms the Commission's <T3>Docket 19129 Phase II Initial Decision</T3> in which the Commissiondecided that non-cash items such as depreciation and deferred taxes shouldbe excluded from lead-lag studies.On reconsideration, the Commission agreed with those parties that suggestedit would be appropriate and less burdensome to include compensated absences(employee time off with pay, such as vacations and sick leave) in lead-lagstudies rather than deducting a portion of accrued compensated absencesfrom the rate base as the Commission's <T3>Report and Order</T3> required. Since compensated absences are analogousto other operating expenses, the Commission decided to allow compensatedabsences to be included in lead-lag studies.The Commission decided to permit the inclusion of the full material andsupplies inventory in the rate base. Although this approach is a departurefrom the Commission's previous position, it resolves the inequity of notallowing the carrier to earn a return on the portion of material and suppliesthat will ultimately be issued for use on long-term construction projects.Since the material and supplies account represents only about 1% of therate base (based on 1988 Tariff Review Plan Data), the impact of this changeon the revenue requirement is approximately four-tenths of one percent.In this <T3>Reconsideration Order</T3> the Commission also amends Part 65 to makespecific reference to the inclusion of Rural Telephone Bank Stock in therate base and to eliminate any instructions which conflict with the Commission'sPart 36 Separations procedures.The Commission was not convinced by arguments to change the rate base treatmentof deferred charges, other deferred credits and deferred taxes. Thus, therate base treatment for these items remains the same as specified in the<T3>Report and Order.</T3> The Commission also did not agree with BellSouthand Southwestern Bell which sought reconsideration of the use of the primerate, rather than the overall rate of return, for accruing AFUDC. The Commissiondid not propose in this proceeding to reconsider the allowable rate tobe applied in determining AFUDC and accordingly, did not consider furtherthe carriers' arguments on this issue. Thus, the Commission did not changethe current requirement that the compound prime rate of interest be usedfor accruing AFUDC.Finally, while the Commission did not change its historically held policyof excluding telecommunications plant adjustments from the rate base unlessa carrier can specifically justify the amounts, this <T3>Reconsideration Order</T3> provides clarification as to what is requiredin seeking approval of plant acquisition adjustments. The Commission hasalso provided for the grandfathering of existing book acquisition adjustmentsas suggested by both CP National and the United States Telephone Association.Grandfathering existing acquisition adjustments means that the Commissionwill continue to recognize within the interstate rate base the interstateportion of plant adjustments that have already been included in the calculationof interstate revenue requirements by the National Exchange Carrier Associationor by individual local exchange carriers. Since these existing acquisitionadjustments have already been included in earlier rate filings, this processshould not have an adverse impact on rates.<ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses </ITAG>Accordingly, it is ordered, pursuant to section 405 of the CommunicationsAct of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 405, that the petitions filed by BellSouth,Contel, CP National, GTE, NTCA, OPASTCO, SNET, Southwestern Bell, Unitedand USTA are granted to the extent discussed herein, and otherwise aredenied. It is further ordered, that under the authority contained in sections 4(i),4(j) 201-205 and 220 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47U.S.C. 154(i), 154(j) 201-205 and 220, Part 65, Interstate Rate of ReturnPrescription Procedures and Methodologies, is amended as shown in the Appendixeffective six months from publication of the text of the rules in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and the rules and policies adopted in this proceedingare prescribed for all dominant carriers. It is further ordered that the petitions for partial waiver filed by RochesterTelephone on September 21, 1988, the United Telephone System Companieson June 20, 1988 and by Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph Company on May20, 1988 are dismissed.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 65</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Communications common carriers,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Telephone, Interstate rate ofreturn prescription procedures and methodologies.<ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Communications Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.

Section 65.820 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 65.820</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Included items. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Telecommunications Plant.</T3> The interstate portion of all assetssummarized in Account 2001 (Telecommunications Plant in Service) and Account2002 (Property Held for Future Use), net of accumulated depreciation andamortization, and Account 2003 (Telecommunications Plant Under Construction-ShortTerm), and, to the extent such inclusions are allowed by this Commission,Account 2005 (Telecommunications Plant Adjustment), net of accumulatedamortization. (b) <T3>Material and Supplies.</T3> The interstate portion of assets summarizedin Account 1220.1 (Material and Supplies). (c) <T3>Noncurrent Assets.</T3> The interstate portion of Class B Rural TelephoneBank stock contained in Account 1402 (Investment in Nonaffiliated Companies)and the interstate portion of assets summarized in Account 1410 (OtherNoncurrent Assets), Account 1438 (Deferred Maintenance and Retirements),and Account 1439 (Deferred Charges) only to the extent that they have beenspecifically approved by this Commission for inclusion. Otherwise, theamounts in accounts 1401-1500 shall not be included. (d) <T3>Cash Working Capital.</T3> The average amount of investor-suppliedcapital needed to provide funds for a carrier's day-to-day interstate operations.Class A carriers may calculate a cash working capital allowance eitherby performing a lead-lag study of interstate revenue and expense itemsor by using the formula set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. ClassB carriers, in lieu of performing a lead-lag study or using the formulain paragraph (e) of this section, may calculate the cash working capitalallowance using a standard allowance which will be established annuallyby the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau. When either the lead-lag study orformula method is used to calculate cash working capital, the amount calculatedunder the study or formula may be increased by minimum bank balances andworking cash advances to determine the cash working capital allowance.Once a carrier has selected a method of determining its cash working capitalallowance, it shall not change to an optional method from one year to thenext without Commission approval.(e) In lieu of a full lead-lag study, carriers may calculate the cash workingcapital allowance using the following formula. (1) Compute the weighted average revenue lag days as follows: (i) Multiply the average revenue lag days for interstate revenues billedin arrears by the percentage of interstate revenues billed in arrears.(ii) Multiply the average revenue lag days for interstate revenues billedin advance by the percentage of interstate revenues billed in advance.(Note: a revenue lead should be shown as a negative lag.) (iii) Add the results of paragraphs (e)(1) (i) and (ii) of this sectionto determine the weighted average revenue lag days. (2) Compute the weighted average expense lag days as follows: (i) Multiply the average lag days for interstate expenses (<T3>i.e.</T3>, cash operating expenses plus interest) paid in arrears bythe percentage of interstate expenses paid in arrears. (ii) Multiply the average lag days for interstate expenses paid in advanceby the percentage of interstate expenses paid in advance. (Note: an expenselead should be shown as a negative lag.) (iii) Add the results of paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this sectionto determine the weighted average expense lag days. (3) Compute the weighted net lag days by deducting the weighted averageexpense lag days from the weighted average revenue lag days. (4) Compute the percentage of a year represented by the weighted net lagdays by dividing the days computed in paragraph (e)(3) of this sectionby 365 days. (5) Compute the cash working capital allowance by multiplying the interstatecash operating expenses (<T3>i.e.</T3>, operating expenses minus depreciation and amortization)plus interest by the percentage computed in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.3. Section 65.830 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 65.830</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Deducted items. </ITAG>(a) The following items shall be deducted from the interstate rate base.(1) The interstate portion of deferred taxes (Accounts 4100 and 4340).(2) The interstate portion of customer deposits (Account 4040). (3) The interstate portion of unfunded accrued pension costs (Account 4310).(4) The interstate portion of other deferred credits (Account 4360) tothe extent they arise from the provision of regulated telecommunicationsservices. This shall include deferred gains related to sale-leaseback arrangements.(b) The interstate portion of deferred taxes, customer deposits and otherdeferred credits shall be determined as prescribed by 47 CFR Part 36. (c) The interstate portion of unfunded accrued pension costs shall bearthe same proportionate relationship as the interstate/intrastate expenseswhich give rise to the liability.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-4504 Filed 3-2-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6712-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
