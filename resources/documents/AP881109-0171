Police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters in Seoul and thesouthern city of Kwangju, an opposition stronghold 188 miles southof Seoul. A small number of arrests were reported.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!'' protesters shouted.   In western Seoul, about 200 students hurled hundreds of firebombsat riot police as the students tried to march out of YonseiUniversity after holding a campus rally. About 10 students andpolicemen were hurt.   In the center of Seoul, two separate groups of up to 100students, throwing rocks and firebombs, also clashed briefly withwith police. A few students were seen being taken away by police.   About 700 students from five colleges, hurling rocks andfirebombs, fought riot police at Chosun University in Kwangju, thecapital of opposition leader Kim Dae-jung's home province, SouthCholla. Police fired volleys of tear gas at the charging students.   Radicals called for anti-government demonstrations Wednesday inSeoul to press for Chun's arrest, but the few students anddissidents who appeared were outnumbered by thousands of riot policeblanketing the area.   Radical students staged violent demonstrations last week todemand that Chun be punished for alleged corruption and human rightsviolations under his government. Dissidents' groups have called foranother major protest Thursday.   Chun, who left office in February after an authoritarianseven-year rule, has come under public criticism for alleged misuseof power and corruption involving him, his family and associates.   Chun denied any wrongdoing, but two close family members havebeen arrested for involvement in financial scandals. Prosecutionofficials indicated Wednesday that two more of Chun's family membersmay be arrested soon.   Chun, who seized power with military backing in 1980, also is thefocus of a parliamentary inquiry into his alleged role in militarilysuppressing a 1980 civil uprising in Kwangju, in which about 200people were killed.   A parliamentary committee investigating the Kwangju incident hasvoted to hear testimony from Chun and about a dozen other peopleduring a hearing beginning Nov. 18.   Other witnesses called by the committee included former U.S.Ambassador William Gleysteen Jr. and John Wickham, ex-commander ofthe U.S. Forces in South Korea. The two Americans served here duringthe Kwangju turmoil.   The United States is accused of helping Chun suppress the Kwangjuuprising. The accusation stems from the fact that Wickham allowed aSouth Korean unit under his operational control to be used to putdown the revolt.   Under a joint command system, all South Korean troops are placedunder the operational control of the top U.S. commander here.   Gleysteen and Wickham have denied Washington's involvement in theKwqangju case. They refused to testify in the South Korean NationalAssembly, but said they would send letters clarifying theirpositions.</TEXT></DOC>
