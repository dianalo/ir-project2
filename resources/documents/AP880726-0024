The gene was the first of a new group of anti-cancer genes thatnormally protect against cancer but allow cancer to appear whendefective, said Ray White of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute atthe University of Utah in Salt Lake City.   Similar anti-cancer genes now have also been linked to coloncancer, another common and lethal form of cancer.   The findings that the gene is linked to breast cancer andso-called small-cell lung cancer suggest that it and otheranti-cancer genes could play a major role in many types of humancancer, White told genetics students at the Jackson Laboratory inBar Harbor on Monday.   Identifying those genes and determining how they go wrong doesnot mean cancer will then be eliminated, White said. But theunderstanding of these genetic abnormalities is crucial toultimately being able to wipe out cancer, he said.   Over the shorter term, he said, understanding the genetics ofcancer might allow doctors to diagnose subtypes of common cancersand learn to treat them better.   The gene was identified in children with a rare eye cancer knownas retinoblastoma. White and Webster Cavenee at the LudwigInstitute for Cancer Research in Montreal were among the scientistswho made that initial discovery and learned how the gene worked.   Later, those retinoblastoma children were found to developosteosarcoma, a bone cancer, also as a result of defects in theretinoblastoma gene.   More recently, researchers at the University of California, SanFrancisco, led by Wen-Hwa Lee and Eva Lee, have found that the geneis defective in certain breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory.   About the same time, Frederic Kaye and colleagues at theNational Cancer Institute-Navy Medical Oncology Branch reportedseeing retinoblastoma gene defects in small-cell lung cancer cellsin the laboratory.   ``It may well be that the majority of small-cell lung cancersinvolve a lesion in the retinoblastoma gene as well as severalothers,'' said White.   Retinoblastoma affects perhaps 1,000 Americans annually, butsmall-cell lung cancer strikes 30,000 people in the United Statesevery year, and breast cancer strikes 130,000.   Suddenly, a gene that was important only in a rare disease isnow seen to be significant in two of the most important and mostdevastating human cancers.   Meanwhile, White had identified a similar anti-cancer gene in arare form of inherited colon cancer.   He said Monday he has now shown that this anti-cancer gene playsa role in the much more common non-inherited form of colon cancerthat is another one of the country's leading cancer killers.   Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins University School ofMedicine in Baltimore also has identified several other geneticdefects associated with colon cancer.   He estimated that perhaps as many as seven genetic defects mustoccur for colon cancer to develop. He said he and White have nowidentified five of those defects.   ``You can look at these genetic alterations as the causes ofcancer _ just as you can look at bacteria as the causes ofinfection,'' Vogelstein said in a telephone interview. ``Exceptit's more complicated in cancer.''</TEXT></DOC>
