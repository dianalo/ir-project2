Determination must be made of the flammability, toxicityand the reactivity of the raw materials which are to be used. This informationusually can be obtained from the Chemical Safety Data Sheets publishedby the Chemical Manufacturers Assn., and other standard references. Informationas to the hazardous characteristics of the intermediates or the reactionsthemselves ordinarily will not be found documented in the literature,nor are such potential dangers necessarily uncovered during developmentof a new process in the laboratory.</TEXT></DOC>
