Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN CANDA FREST </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   The dollar slipped yesterday in quiet dealings in which cross-trading between non-dollar currencies continued to dominate, traders said.    As the dollar remained confined in a narrow trading range, Japan's finance ministry proposed a sharp buildup of funds available for intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.    Traders have attributed the dollar's timid movements in recent days to fears of a reappearance of heavy, coordinated central bank support of the U.S. currency. Such intervention was seen earlier this month, with the Bank of Japan playing a key role.    The Japanese finance ministry in Tokyo yesterday submitted a budget proposal to parliament that requested raising the ceiling for offering foreign exchange fund bills to 28 trillion yen in fiscal 1988 from 19 trillion yen ($148.6 million) this fiscal year, which ends March 31. The finance ministry issues the short-term bills, maturing in 60 days, to raise funds it can use for intervention, when necessary. Parliament is expected to approve the request.    Japanese officials said the proposal is in line with an agreement among major industrial countries to conduct concerted currency market intervention to keep the dollar, the yen and other key currencies stable. The sharp increase appeared to demonstrate the government's determination to support the dollar if the U.S. currency starts declining again.    Earlier this month President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said they agreed on arrangements by which the U.S. would obtain Japanese currency for intervention purposes in support of the dollar. Central banks prop the dollar in foreign exchange markets by purchasing dollars with other currencies, primarily the West German mark and Japanese yen.    In December the Group of Seven industrial nations, including the U.S., Japan and West Germany, renewed commitments to stabilize dollar exchange rates through coordinated intervention. Large-scale dollar purchases by major central banks at the start of 1988 propelled the dollar sharply higher into its current trading range.    The dollar continued to bob and weave in a narrow band yesterday. &quot;We're basically in a no-man's land,&quot; Robert K. Ryan, vice president of foreign exchange at Irving Trust Co., New York, said. &quot;For the moment, the dollar seems to be locked in a zone. We trade up to one end and down to the other,&quot; he said.    In late New York dealings, the dollar stood at 1.6729 marks, off 0.6% from 1.6827 Monday. The dollar eased to 127.65 yen, from 128. The British pound firmed to $1.7745, from $1.7685.    In Tokyo, the dollar opened slightly lower at 127.50 yen Wednesday, compared with 127.55 yesterday.    Traders expect today's report from Washington on fourth quarter growth to show that the economy expanded at a rate between 3% and 4% during the period.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 20 cents an ounce to $469.10 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was five million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $470.85 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Tuesday, Jan. 26, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
