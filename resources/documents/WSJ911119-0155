While the Bush administration had hoped the prime-rate cutwould persuade corporations to borrow for capital spendingand expansion, that hasn't happened yet. Still, economistsexpect that as the business picture brightens, loan demandwill pick up, although the growth will be slow and uneven, aswith the economy itself.</LP><TEXT>   Bankers are coming to the same conclusion as they preparetheir 1992 budgets. A spot check late last week of corporateborrowing needs for 1992 by loan officers from Merchants Bankin Allentown, Pa., for instance, gave Robert Knipe, thebank's president, a pleasant surprise.   He found that a local cable company plans to seek $300,000to convert to fiber optics, a control-valve company will needa greater working-capital loan for an expected 12% increasein sales, and an excavating contractor wants a $1 millionloan now to buy equipment that may be hard to obtain once arecovery gets under way.   It's not enough to bring back the heady growth of the late1980s, perhaps, but it's at least enough to prompt Mr. Knipeto project 5% growth for his $600 million commercial loanportfolio, in contrast with a decline of more than 8% thisyear.   Economic consulting firm DRI Inc. expects commercial andindustrial loans at the nation's banks to rise a slight 1%,compared with a decline of 3% to 4% for 1991. And MellonBank's chief economist, Norman Robertson, sees a 3% gain in1992 over this year, less than usual in economic recoveriesbecause &quot;the days in which companies would borrow to rebuildinventories are pretty much gone.&quot;   In the Northeast, which was hardest hit by the recession,Bank of Boston's head of regional corporate banking, RobertMahoney, said he expects &quot;we will look back a year from now&quot;and see that the fourth quarter of 1991 and the first quarterof 1992 were a turning point. Borrowing by corporations won'tbe leaping up, however, largely because demand for their ownproducts remains weak, but also because of tighter inventorycontrol and cash-management practices, he notes.   But his industry-by-industry outlook for loan demand isnow flashing &quot;uneven,&quot; whereas for the past two years therehave been across-the-board declines in borrowing. And heexpects lower rates will prompt consumers to buy new homesand condominiums in the spring, which will change attitudesand eventually give corporations a reason to boost borrowing.   The lower prime rate hasn't turned out to be the hoped-forspark plug. First Fidelity Bancorp, for instance, was almosta week ahead of the nation's banks in lowering the prime raterecently, cutting it a quarter of a percentage point. Itscorporate calling officers got in touch with 1,700 clientswithin the first 24 hours.   While the extra hustle and price leadership wasappreciated, only a few customers snapped up the New Jerseybanking company's bargain rates. That's what other big banksfound, too, when they went further than First Fidelity andlowered the prime one half of a percentage point on Nov. 6 to7.5%, the lowest level for the benchmark rate in five years.   &quot;It's not had any material impact at all,&quot; says RobertBourke, head of Midwest banking for First Chicago Corp.&quot;Dropping interest rates did not bring in a torrent ofborrowers,&quot; adds Frank Lourenso, who directs 500middle-market lending officers at Chemical Bank in New York.&quot;Most companies I talk to continue to be pretty cautious.Nobody sees us zooming out of a recession.&quot;   Mr. Lourenso says his loan officers now spend 45% of theirtime calling on potential customers, compared with 40% oftheir time a few years ago.   Several bankers said that, despite all the talk of acredit crunch, they expect competition for corporatecustomers to become more intense next year. &quot;Banks are goingto be rather desperate for loan volume in this coming year,&quot;expects Ed Morsman, chief lending officer of Norwest BankMinnesota. With still too many banks serving the country, hesaid, &quot;some people may be stretching a little bit to makeloans. They may get pretty aggressive in terms of what theyconsider a good loan.&quot;   Standards aren't going to be lowered at First FidelityBancorp, but Anthony Terracciano, chairman, said, &quot;For theright quality business we will compete on price.&quot; He said hisbanking company's prime rate move was intended &quot;to send asignal that we are open for business.&quot;   It will take some hard selling to persuade most corporateborrowers to take on more debt. The latest survey of theNational Federation of Independent Business showed that thepercentage of small businesses borrowing on a regular basisfell to 33%, the lowest quarterly level since 1973, when thequestion was first asked. Also disquieting for bankers isthat only 13% of the companies reported plans for inventoryaccumulation, while 17% planned reductions over the nextthree to six months.   There's also a strong move on by corporations to reducedebt in favor of equity on their balance sheets. Thus, theyare using most of the hundreds of billions of dollars raisedthrough new bond and equity offerings this year to repay olddebt, rather than for spending on new projects that wouldbenefit the economy.   York International Corp., for instance, said yesterday itwas calling for redemption of $160 million of its 17.5%debentures. The funds will come from proceeds from thecompany's recent initial public stock offering.   Companies have raised $223 billion in the bond market sofar this year, nearly $100 billion more than last year atthis time, according to IDD Information Services. Most ofthat money has gone to refinance higher interest rate bondsor bank debt, with the result that &quot;net funds raised continuedownward as they have since the late 1980s,&quot; said SteveStrongin, a vice president and economic adviser at theFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago.   Similarly, the preponderance of the $61 billion in equityraised on Wall Street this year -- nearly three times therate at which equity was raised in 1990 -- is going to paydown debt. Since much of the bank repayments find their wayinto government securities these days, that helps keepinterest rates low. But as Cynthia Latta, a senior financialeconomist at DRI says, &quot;At the margin that has to help, butit doesn't jump start the economy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
