The Sony affiliate's poor showing -- which many marketparticipants describe as the most disappointing stock debutthey can remember -- has highlighted both the weakness of theTokyo stock market and the increasing desperation of someJapanese companies' search for capital.</LP><TEXT>   In the past several days, a half-dozen companies havebacked out of plans to take their companies public. OnWednesday, aluminum window-frame maker Fuji Sash Co.temporarily withdrew plans to offer 3.5 million shares on thesecond section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Drillmanufacturer Okada Aiyon also said Wednesday it's putting offplans to offer 990,000 shares on the second section of theOsaka Stock Exchange.   On Monday, four of the 15 companies scheduled to begininitial public offerings on the Tokyo over-the-counter marketbefore the end of the year canceled their listing plans. TheJapan Securities Dealers' Association, which must approve allnew OTC listings, hasn't received word from the remaining 11companies yet, but officials at several of the nation'slargest brokerage houses say privately they expect all butone or two to call off their listings as well.   &quot;The market situation now is absolutely awful,&quot; saidYukinari Yamamoto, a spokesman for Nikko Securities Co.&quot;There's no need to make things worse.&quot; Mr. Yamamoto saidunderwriting officials at Nikko and several other largebrokerage houses have informally &quot;advised&quot; Japan SecuritiesDealers' Association officials to suspend new listings untilconditions improve.   If the association follows those recommendations, it wouldbe the first time the group has called off new listings sinceOctober 1987, the time of Wall Street's Black Monday crash.   Analysts attribute the sudden weakness in the OTC marketto the Sony subsidiary's debacle last Friday. About 18million shares of the affiliate, Sony Music Entertainment,were offered to investors on the second section of the Tokyoexchange at 6,800 yen ($51.95) a share. No buyers cameforward for the entire trading session Friday, and buyerscontinued to stay away until the price was cut to 5,500 yenMonday.   Sony Music's flop has added another blot to the reputationof the issue's lead underwriter, scandal-plagued NomuraSecurities Co. Market participants complain that Nomuraunderwriters vastly overestimated the market's ability todigest nearly 120 billion yen in new stock offered by thecompany. The criticism has Nomura, the lead underwriter forFuji Sash and Okada Aiyon, on the ropes. Local press reportssaid the two concerns were persuaded to drop their listingplans by members of the Nomura underwriting team. A Nomuraofficial refused to comment directly on the reports but saidthere was a &quot;high possibility&quot; they were accurate.   In the market's heyday in the late 1980s, Japan'scorporations funded ambitious capital-spending plans byraising vast sums on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. But two yearsof tight monetary policy and the collapse of Tokyo shareprices have thrown sand in the gears of Tokyo's underwritingmachinery.   In the 12 months ended Sept. 30, Japanese companies raised194.7 billion yen by selling new shares on the Tokyoexchange, about a fourth the amount of money they raisedduring the like period a year earlier. In recent months,officials at the Ministry of Finance have urged the nation'sbig brokers to restrain the flow of new issues on theexchange's first and second sections.   Therefore, an increasing number of credit-hungry concernshave tried to get around the restraints on the TSE by raisingmoney on the less closely regulated OTC market. In Novemberalone, a record 27 concerns raised capital through OTClistings, pushing the number of OTC companies to 419, twomore than are listed on the TSE's second section. But theopening price in open-market trading was below the offeringprice set at auction for 13 of the 27 companies. That's a bigchange from the past, when the share price of new listingsalmost invariably soared in the first days of trading.   Officials at Japanese companies seeking to raise money onthe stock market are acting &quot;like they're trapped in aburning theater,&quot; says Craig Chudler, an analyst atUBS-Philips andamp; Drew International Ltd. &quot;Everybody kills eachother rushing for the door.&quot;   The Japanese government has contributed to the equityoversupply. This month, the Finance Ministry spookedinvestors when it made discreet inquiries about selling anadditional 500,000 shares in Nippon Telegraph andamp; TelephoneCorp., Japan's partly privatized telecommunications giant,which analysts estimate would have tapped the market forabout 350 billion yen. The prospect horrified many marketparticipants, who fear that the market already has beenstuffed too full with new paper. The Finance Ministry haspromised to sell a total of 2.5 million NTT shares by 1995.   On Wednesday, Kyodo News Service quoted Finance Ministrysources as saying the ministry had decided to give up theplanned sale of government-owned NTT shares for this yearbecause of the market slump. But the ministry still hopes tosell the shares before the current fiscal year ends nextMarch 31, the sources said.   Meanwhile, two other former state monopolies eagerly awaittheir turn to take in money from Japan's equity markets.Analysts estimate that the government plans to raise at least600 billion yen through the sale of stock in recentlyprivatized Japan Tobacco Corp., and transportationauthorities have indicated they hope to raise roughly 500billion yen through the primary markets over the next twoyears by listing stock of the three railway companies createdby the breakup of state-owned Japan National Railways.   The share price of Sony Music Entertainment has fallen farenough that some analysts are recommending the stock toclients. Early Thursday, the stock closed up 50 yen to 5,270yen. &quot;It works out to be a fairly good deal at these levels,&quot;said Jeffery Zavattero, an electronics analyst at JardineFleming Securities (Japan) Ltd. &quot;Once all the smoke clears,&quot;he predicts, &quot;the Sony Music shares really won't look sobad.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
