<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-1258 </DOCNO><TEXT>The data processing system for ETL TPE-2 consists of 2 CPU systems andit is composing a duplex system. One system is used as a data acquisitionsystem, which is abbreviated as DAS and functions controlling variousdata input devices, data acquisition, communication with the main controllerof TPE-2 confirming safety system operation. Another one is used as dataprocessing system, which is abbreviated as DPS and functions the processingof the data after the acquisition, the interconnections with the mainframeand the development of software. A transient memory system, which has64 channels of 8 bits ADC with maximum sampling frequency of 20 MHz and4 KB buffer memory in each channel, is used to record the time sequentialexperimental data. Two CAMAC crates are used for the acquisition of theinformations of the experiment condition and Thomson scattering data.They are composing a serial high way system through fiber optics. TheCAMAC crate for Thomson scattering data is controlled by a personal computer,HP-85, and is available stand-alone use, and the communication betweenthe CAMAC system and DAS is easily performed by using a CAMAC memorymodule as an intermediator without complicated procedure in the connectionof different type computers. Two magnetic disk pack units, which havethe formatted storage capacity of 158 KB in each one and can record thedata over 2,000 shots, are used in parallel with a magnetic tape handlerfor the data file. Thus we realized the high speed data processing overthe wide range of experimental shots and confirmed the preservation ofthe data.</TEXT></DOC>
