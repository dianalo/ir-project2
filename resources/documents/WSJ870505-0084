Sokolow, a major figure in the Dennis Levine case, was reduced by one-third by a judge who said he never meant for Mr. Sokolow to serve the full year-and-a-day term he imposed in November.    Mr. Sokolow is a former vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. who the government charged helped Mr. Levine make more than $7 million of his $12.6 million in illegal stock profits from 1980 to 1985.    Mr. Sokolow, who was paid $85,000 for the inside data, pleaded guilty to two felony counts last fall. He is currently in the federal prison at Loretto, Pa.    Mr. Sokolow was sentenced to the 366-day prison term, plus three years' probation, by U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan last Nov. 6. But Judge Keenan, acting on a motion from Mr. Sokolow's attorneys, ruled yesterday that Mr. Sokolow's sentence be reduced to eight months. In a short opinion, Judge Keenan said that he had wanted the former investment banker to be eligible for parole after four months, and that he expected him to be released after eight months at the most. The judge said &quot;it now appears,&quot; however, that parole guidelines would have forced Mr. Sokolow to serve the full 366-day term.    The judge said he was reducing Mr. Sokolow's prison term &quot;in the interest of justice . . . to effect the original intent of the Court.&quot;    Mr. Sokolow, 32 years old, was the first person sentenced in the Levine scandal, and was one of three to receive year-and-a-day sentences. The extra day on a one-year sentence had been used by judges to ensure that a defendant would be eligible for parole after four months. Under former parole guidelines, parole was only available to defendants who were sentenced to more than a year. However, under current parole guidelines, Mr. Sokolow wouldn't probably be granted parole at any time during his incarceration.    Judge Keenan, who earlier sentenced a friend of Mr. Sokolow's -- former Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. vice president David Brown -- to 30 days in prison and other penalties in the Levine case, emphasized that the sentence reduction in Mr. Sokolow's case shouldn't be misread as overt leniency. Mr. Sokolow's attorneys had wanted the sentenced trimmed to six months.    &quot;The reduction . . . should in no way be construed to reflect a diminution in the Court's view of the seriousness of the offense for which Sokolow was sentenced,&quot; the judge wrote, adding as he did at sentencing that insider trading &quot;undermines the integrity of the (stock) market.&quot;    Peter Fleming, Mr. Sokolow's lawyer, hailed the reduction as a &quot;fair and compassionate exercise of the court's discretion.&quot;    Of the two other Levine co-conspirators who received 366-day terms, Ilan K. Reich, a former lawyer at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, is awaiting a decision from U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet on a similar motion; Robert Wilkis, a former investment banker at Lazard Freres andamp; Co., hasn't yet made such a motion, his attorneys said.    Separately, the sentence of former Lazard financial analyst Randall D. Cecola, a minor figure in the Levine scandal who pleaded guilty to filing false tax returns, was recently reduced to five years' probation from six by another federal judge.    The Levine insider case led prosecutors to Ivan F. Boesky, whose guilty plea and cooperation has been a key part of the continuing probe into possible securities-law violations on Wall Street. </TEXT></DOC>
