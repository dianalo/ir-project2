Rutherford Backscattering (RBS) and Auger electronspectroscopies have been utilized to characterize thin palladium contactson mercuric iodide (HgI{sub 2}) detectors. The RBS measurements wereperformed at room temperature with the metal contact preventing evaporateloss of the HgI{sub 2} and reducing contamination to the vacuum chamber.Computer simulations of the RBS results indicate that the interface regionof a sample with a palladium contact had approximately the ideal stoichiometrybut that the palladium film thickness (350 {angstrom}) was less thanexpected from the deposition conditions. Auger sputter profiling whichremoves the metal contact ``cap'' was performed with a rapid transfersystem equipped with liquid nitrogen cooling to avoid evaporative lossof the sample and reduce vacuum system contamination. This techniqueindicated significant penetration of Hg and I into the Pd contact fora variety of samples. In many cases, the penetration extended all theway to the surface. For a 600 {angstrom} contact, approximately two thirdsor 400 {angstrom} of the contact is part of a ``reaction zone'' in whichthere is strong intermixing of the palladium, mercury, and iodine. Inone case, where copper was tried as an electrode, the ``reaction zone''extended all the way to the surface, and the device failed as a detector.The relationship of the contact stoichiometry to the deposition processand device performance will be discussed. 5 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
