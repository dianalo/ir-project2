 Now, thechallenge is integration: to leverage the capabilities and benefits of thetools by enabling them to talk to one another.andM;The result--instead of working in isolation, automation tools will work inconcert.andP;  For example, instead of human operators intercepting messages thatthey must act upon, the exception message is sent to another software tool,which will act upon it without human intervention.andP;  Human operators will onlybe called upon to solve problems requiring a higher level of expertise.andM;&quot;Take a problem in a change management application in an IBM mainframe underMVS,&quot; says Mark Levin, principal in charge of national data centertransformation practice at KPMG Peat Marwick, Boston-based consultants.andO;&quot;Typically, when a problem arises, you need an operator to intervene.andP;  Butwhy can't the console management system read the message that the job hasfailed and open up the problem determination record?andM;&quot;Or say you're running an automated job scheduling package, and you're alsorunning an automated restart manager,&quot; Levin continues.andP;  &quot;The job fails, butit has already run multiple reports.andP;  Wouldn't it be good if the restartmanager would delete all those reports instead of you doing it manually?&quot;andM;Integrating automated operations tools hinges on determining therelationships between software products, such as automated console managementand scheduling software configuration management and data center reporting,Levin says.andM;&quot;We've defined about 14 to 15 relationships,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;You can't treatthese products in isolation.andP;  They are complementary to each other.andP;  The realbang for the buck is in getting these products to automate themselves andreduce manual intervention.andM;&quot;Typically, we find there are four functional areas in a data center:console, tape, print and user services, which includes the help desk, jobsetup and scheduling.andP;  You can automate any of those and receive a benefit,but you will also increase wait time as a result,&quot; Levin said.andM;ATTACKING FUNCTIONAL AREASandM;&quot;To reduce wait time, you must attack all four functional areas.andP;  There areproducts that support all of those areas.andP;  When they're interrelated, thateliminates wait time,&quot; he said.andM;For experienced users with a number of automated operations tools in use intheir shops, integration of those products has become increasingly criticalto fully realizing the benefits of automated operations.andP;  &quot;It's absolutelyimportant that multi-vendor products be able to communicate with oneanother,&quot; says Ed White, manager of operating systems software at R.J.andO;Reynolds Tobacco Co., Winston-Salem, N.C.andM;White should know.andP;  His IBM MVS shop supports many products, including WTLManager from Boole andamp; Babbage/Empact Software, Sunnyvale, Calif., for messagehandling, Netview from IBM for network management, Omegamon from CandleCorp., Los Angeles, for performance monitoring and OPS/MVS from MVS Software,Los Angeles, for systems automation.andM;&quot;Automation should be a concerted effort being solved by multiple tools.andO;There have to be interfaces.andP;  Network automation is more isolated, but it'sstill connected with it,&quot; White says.andM;Using products from multiple vendors is the way to achieve optimal results,according to White.andP;  &quot;If you limit yourself to a single-vendor solution,you're in the situation of taking less than the best.andP;  One company won't bethe best in all categories.&quot;andM;Integration among products gives users a degree of flexibility in determiningthe best ways to automate various data center functions.andM;White said, &quot;We're guilty of moving things back and forth.andP;  For example, wewere using OPS/MVS to initiate some tasks within the system.andP;  Then we said,'Wait a minute, that's a scheduling function.'andP;  If the scheduler isn't doingit, it's being handled by the wrong piece.andP;  Activities are moving back andforth from one piece to another.andM;&quot;We had to go back and forth before we decided where it belonged.andP;  You can'tdo that unless products are well-integrated,&quot;&quot; White said.andM;Nevertheless, the task should not be taken lightly, white emphasizes.andO;Integration requires careful planning and some degree of trial and error.andO;&quot;It's a complicated issue.andP;  Responsibilities for a given task should beconcentrated in the area where that responsibility belongs.andP;  You can getcrossed up if you're not careful.&quot;andM;When truly effective integration is accomplished, it is almost transparent,White adds.andP;  &quot;Things start sliding across from one to another.andP;  Thenintegration becomes a management issue.&quot;andM;BENEFITS OF INTEGRATIONandM;According to Levin, the benefits of integrating automated operations toolscan be defined in three ways: as business benefits, quantifiable benefits andquasi-quantifiable benefits.andP;  Overall business benefits, the hardest toquantify, include improved services to end users and customers, and improvedbusiness-to-business relationships.andM;Quantifiable benefits include staff reductions through reassignment andattrition, as well as savings in hardware, supplies and space.andP;  What Levinterms &quot;quasi-quantifiable&quot; benefits--those that can only sometimes be equatedwith dollar values--include reduced error rates, increased online ability,improved service levels and increased security.andM;Vendors of automation software are just beginning to address theseinterrelationships.andP;  &quot;All automated operations software vendors are going inthe direction of integration,&quot; says Jeff Schulman, vice president of softwaremanagement strategies at the Gartner Group, Stamford, Conn.andM;User demands are driving vendor efforts, Schulman says.andP;  Gartner Groupstudies show that of its client base, which spans about half of the Fortune1000, some 70% are engaged in automated operations to some degree.andP;  Of thatnumber, 10% are starting to realize benefits.andM;&quot;Users don't want to deal with tons of vendors,&quot; Schulman says.andP;  &quot;They wantto deal with vendors who provide architected solutions.andP;  Second, they wantmore intelligence and programmability in their tools.&quot;andM;Integration among a vendor's products can inject new life into a matureproduct line, Schulman notes, and can be done in two ways.andP;  First, by addingnew products with interfaces to the existing products(s).andP;  (He refers to thisas &quot;vertical&quot; integration.)andP;  Or, a vendor may &quot;horizontally&quot; integrated itsproduct line by creating a common interface to integrate all tools.andM;As for integration among different vendors, however, &quot;that's an interestingcat-and-mouse game,&quot; Schulman says.andP;  Most vendors don't see much to be gainedby writing interfaces to their competitors' products, he says, unless it isto take advantage of a product so popular it's become a $Ide facto$Nstandard, such as Candle's Omegamon performance monitor.andP;  Naturally, vendorswhose product lines are narrower in scope will be more compelled to provideinterfaces to other vendors' products.andM;Candle now integrates its AF/Operator automation facilities software andAF/Remote PC complement with its bread-and-butter performance monitor,Omegamon.andP;  Using a bidirectional interface, AF/Operator can be tailored toact on exceptions detected by Omegamon for MVS, IMS, CICS and DB2.andP;  Candle'sStatus Monitor provides a central viewing point.andM;&quot;One of the big problems with automated operations products is that theyprovide lots of facilities and features but not an integrated approach,methodology or solution,&quot; says Violet Hom, senior product manager at Candle.andO;Candle's products are integrated under Omegacenter.andM;The AF/Operator-Omegamon interface has been available since February, but theOmegacenter architecture has only recently been defined, according to Hom.andO;&quot;We're building a base with common protocols, so all out products caninterface with each other.&quot;andM;As for building interfaces to other vendors' products, Hom says Candle is&quot;looking in the general areas of problem management, change management,scheduling, print and report distribution, configuration management andenvironmental management.&quot;andM;Candle will likely build interfaces to products viewed as industry standards,Hom adds, although the vendor hasn't established a timeframe for when theseinterfaces will fe offered.andP;  &quot;We can't afford to build interfaces toeveryone.andP;  This is more a statement of direction at this point.&quot;andM;&quot;COSMETIC CONNECTIVITY&quot;andM;Mario Morino, Chairman of the board of LEgent Corp., Vienna, Va., believes inan architected approach to integration.andP;  Legent, formed by the merger ofDuquesne Systems and Morino Inc., is the maker of AutoMate/MVS, AutoMAte/XC,its remote PC product, and Multi-image Manager, which provides a singlecontrol point.andM;&quot;We want people to think in terms of architecture--a description of protocolsfor how things will talk to each other,&quot; Morino says.andP;  &quot;What's strategic isprocess flow, laying out the rules for how things will function as well asrules for interfacing.&quot;andM;This overall structure is necessary, Morino says, to avoid needlessdependencies.andP;  &quot;Today there is a lot of 'cosmetic connectivity,' whereeverything is patch-worked together.&quot;andM;In order to achieve integration, vendors have to alter &quot;substantial parts oftheir products,&quot; Morino says.andP;  &quot;Functionality is not necessarily integration,a common 'look and feel' is not necessarily integration.andP;  The key is a totalinterchangeability of products that can reach across to one another inrealtime and interact.&quot;andM;FLEXIBLE INTERFACE WILL PAY OFFandM;Morino believes a rule-driven, generalized, &quot;open&quot; interface capability willprovide more interchangeability than hard-coded, function-specificinterfaces.andP;  &quot;A prescribed protocol will act on information in a standardway, and signal back in a standard way--all through a single point ofcommunication,&quot; he said.andM;And what are the benefits of such an approach?andM;&quot;Over time, the flexibility of the system is greatly enhanced,&quot; Morino says.andO;&quot;The cost of change and training people is much lower because people arelearning at protocol rather than elemental levels.&quot;andM;Such an approach protects users' existing investments, allowing them to writetheir own interfaces according to their process priorities and particulartool choices, adds Greg Coticchia, manager of Legent's OperationsProductivity Group.andP;  To this end, Legent offers the Open Interface for Vtamoption to AutoMate/MVS, which extends AutoMate/MVS' capabilities to any Vtamapplication.andM;Legent provides specific interfaces as well, Coticchia says, to users whohave purchased Automate with the rule-based Open Interface.andP;  Legent nowoffers over 14 different application interfaces from eight differentproducts, from such vendors as Candle, IBM, Computer AssociatesInternational, and Boole andamp; Babbage.andP;  &quot;People want to buy from fewer vendors,but they don't want to rip out what they've already invested in,&quot; Coticchiasays.andM;OPS/MVS from MVS Software interfaces with Candle's Omegamon.andP;  &quot;The OPS/MVSpeople recognize that they're not able to do everything,&quot; says Ed White ofR.J.andP;  Reynolds, who uses all three products.andP;  &quot;On our own, we're alsointerfacing OPS/MVS to our problem and change management system.&quot;andM;He adds, however, that a highly trained staff makes building such aninterface possible.andM;In addition to a direct subsystem linkage to Omegamon, notes Jim Woodhill,vice president of marketing for MVS Software, the vendor also offers theExternal Product Interface (EPI) for Vtam applications, a generalizedinterface to other operations tools.andP;  EPI provides the framework for two-waysupport for Omegamon and Computer Associates' CA-7 scheduler.andM;UNDER INTEGRATION UMBRELLAandM;Boole andamp; Babbage, maker of AutoOperator, is lining up all its major automatedoperations products under the MainView integration umbrella, says RayGehring, product marketing manager.andM;MainView is a communications platform that allows companies with multipledata centers worldwide to run products in a seamless environment, no matterwhere they are located, says Gehring.andP;  Users can hotkey back and forthbetween products.andP;  In addition, the vendor's products share a common look andfeel, he says.andM;Now under development is the Open System Procedural Interface (Ospi), whichwill allow AutoOperator to interface with other vendors' products.andP;  An openinterface for Vtam applications, Ospi will be commercially available in thefirst quarter next year, Gehring says.andM;BUILDING ON NATURALandM;A relative newcomer to the automated operations arena, Software AG, Reston,Va., is taking an approach based on its Natural fourth-generation language toensure integration among its products.andP;  &quot;Everything is at a common syntaxlevel, which allows increased flexibility and customization,&quot; said JimRickards, product manager for data center automation.andM;Software AG plans to develop all its automated operations products accordingto its Integrated System Architecture (ISA), geared to multiple IBMplatforms, including MVS, VSE and VM.andP;  &quot;Everything will be portable withoutchanges in application,&quot; Rickards claims.andP;  Integration with other vendors'products is &quot;being evaluated,&quot; he says.andM;Natural Process is Software AG's name for its core technology.andP;  NaturalOperations, an automated scheduler, is the first product based on it.andP;  &quot;We'rebuilding multiple products in the system software area,&quot; Rickards says.andM;Natural Console and Natural Network, for console and network management,respectively, are slated for late this year or early next year.andM;Computer Associates International Inc., Garden City, N.Y., recently announcedseveral new products to fill out its data center product line, includingCA-Opera/PC and CA-Opera VM.andP;  The vendor also claims to have increasedintegration among its products.andM;Yet another issue in integrating automated operations is the extension ofautomated operations beyond the IBM world--to hardware from Digital EquipmentCorp., Maynard, Mass., Tandem Computers, Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., bothof Cupertino, Calif., and Unisys Corp. of Blue Bell, Pa.andM;Chris Brown, systems programmer, with Mack Truck, Allentown, Pa., a user ofLegent's AutoMate/MVS, says his company's DEC and Tandem systems, used forengineering and parts distribution, respectively will play a major role infuture automated operations plans.andM;&quot;Instead of buying a separate automation system, I'd like to use AutoMate/XC[Legent's remote tool] to handle those two types of machines,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;ThePC can already handle IBM-type systems.andP;  Now we're looking at the messagetraffic on our DEC and Tandem systems.andP;  Instead of running three systemsseparately, we'd like to run three from one source.&quot;andM;Brown says this would offer him a big advantage--a single point of control.andO;&quot;For instance, both the DEC and Tandem systems have their own networks.andP;  Ifwe could combine the three onto one screen, the network people could monitorall three networks a lot easier.andP;  And we could buy just one package.&quot;andO;According to Coticchia, Legent plans to extend AutoMate to DEC andHewlett-Packard platforms, and others.andM;&quot;DISSIMILAR HOST SUPPORT&quot; COMINGandM;Similarly, MVS Software's &quot;next frontier,&quot; according to Woodhill, is&quot;dissimilar host support,&quot; referring to any computers other than IBMSystem/370s running MVS/XA or MVS/ESA.andP;  The vendor's Outboard ConsoleFacility (OCF) product will be the means to implement such support.andM;&quot;We'll start with DEC and Tandem at customer sites by the end of the year,&quot;Woodhill says.andP;  When such support will be commercially available is vague.andO;&quot;We'll have to see how it goes.andP;  Our technical expertise is more oriented toIBM world,&quot; Woodhill says.andM;Boole andamp; Babbage views the outboard PC component, the Elan OperatorWorkstation, as its port to the non-IBM world, says Gehring.andP;  He expects sucha port to be commercially available in mid-1990.andP;  &quot;It's one of our highestpriorities,&quot; he says.andM;Candle plans a similar approach with its PC product, AF/Remote.andP;  &quot;Theapproach is to build Ascii console support into AF/Remote to allowintegration of non-IBM systems,&quot; says senior product manager Hom.andM;When such capabilities will be available is unclear.andP;  She says it will be&quot;soon.&quot;andM;However, heterogeneous control is available today from Votek Systems,Richmond Hill, Ontario, in the form of cTIC, a front end to Votek's TheIntelligent Console (TIC) line.andP;  The cTIC allows dissimilar computers tocommunicate with a single console.andM;Votek is planning an enhancement of cTIC for early next year that will morethoroughly integrate the diverse elements of a large data center, says BjornLarsen, Votek's president.andP;  Based on a fault-tolerant platform and an SQLdatabase model, the new product will provide fuller integration capabilities,Larsen says.andM;Such capabilities are essential, Larsen says, to achieve &quot;enterpriseautomation,&quot; Larsen's term for his top-down view of automated operations.andO;&quot;If you look at the data center as a single entity, you can strategicallysolve problems,&quot; he says.andM;&quot;Automation must happen in all places,&quot; Larsen asserts, &quot;some in the host,some outboard, and some in people's heads.andP;  All must cooperate across variouspieces in the data center.andP;  Today, they don't speak; tomorrow, they have to.&quot;andM;Integrating automated operations tools presents a challenge for both vendorsand users.andP;  Users must plan strategically to pull it off successfully--and beunafraid to change course if a better solution presents itself.andM;Levin of Peat Marwick advises, &quot;Don't say, 'Wouldn't it be nice if thistalked to that.&quot;andP;  Figure all that out up front.andP;  But it's never too late toalter your course and regroup.andP;  There's always another way to look at thesame thing.&quot;andM;Ed White concurs.andP;  As fast as technology is growing, what not long ago wasvaporware is now starting to appear.andM;&quot;We keep looking at alterntive solutions,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;If we don't, we'll payfor it down the line.andP;  We don't think of anything we're doing as permanent.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
