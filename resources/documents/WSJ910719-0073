The decision by the three-member board, expected to resultin cuts in train crew sizes and longer workdays or train runsfor the crews, dashed rail unions' hopes of averting whatmany union officials regard as a disaster. The findings alsowould boost wages modestly, but shift some of the burden forhealth-care costs to workers.</LP><TEXT>   The review board, named by President Bush as an outgrowthof congressional action that ended a one-day rail strike inApril, rejected all proposed modifications to a report madein January by a presidential emergency board.   The railroads and unions can still sidestep those findingson any issue in the next 10 days, by reaching agreement atthe bargaining table after three years of impasse. Thespecial board urged them to do that, but noted &quot;the partiesare reluctant to modify their original bargaining position.&quot;   Mac Fleming, president of the Brotherhood of MaintenanceWay Employees, said there would be little reason for unionsto try to compromise now, because the railroads can just sittight and let the findings go into effect. &quot;This was ourfinal opportunity to change things,&quot; he said, while therailroads &quot;have everything going for them -- why would theywant to change anything?&quot;   United Transportation Union officials said the reportstands to cost the union one-fourth or more of itsmembership, through reductions in the brakemen whom the UTUrepresents. Glen Eickmann, a UTU general chairman in Topeka,Kan., said the board recommendations represented a&quot;catastrophe&quot; for UTU members.   Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers President LarryMcFather called the special board report &quot;completely unfairto the locomotive engineers, a corruption of Congress'sintent and a shame on the Bush administration.&quot; Roadengineers will lose $5,000 a year in pay because of increasesin their basic workday, Mr. McFather said.   By upholding the emergency board's findings, the reviewboard ordered a substantial increase in the mileage thatcrews must travel to receive a day's pay. The board alsoordered that the tough issue of crew sizes continue to benegotiated locally, as the unions want, but that arbitrationsettle disputes that drag on, which the unions oppose. Thefindings also will require track-maintenance workers totravel much farther to do their work.   They also provide for lump-sum wage payments and wageincreases of 3% to 4% annually through 1995, andcost-of-living increases after that. But as much as half ofthose wage rises would cover up to 25% of any increases inhealth-insurance costs. &quot;In addition to making less forworking more, we will be required to pay health costs, whichwill mean more financial hardship,&quot; the engineers' Mr.McFather said.   By contrast, the railroads are clearly happy thatimportant work-rule changes they have been seeking for yearswill finally materialize. A spokesman for Union PacificCorp.'s rail unit said the railroad wanted more work-rulerelief and more wage moderation. &quot;But on balance, we thinkthe report is fair and we're pleased that the special boardhas maintained the integrity of the originalrecommendations,&quot; he said.   Rail unions have sometimes benefited in the past fromemergency board reports that were fairly favorable, andCongress halted strikes by enacting those recommendations.But this time the January report went more the industry'sway, and Congress, in stopping the strike, gave the unionsanother chance to plead their cases. But it sharply limitedthe special board's discretion in modifying the emergencyboard findings. Union leaders wanted to be able to show theirmembers they had gone the last mile to improve theircontracts.   Mr. McFather said his union probably will seek tonegotiate individually with the railroads in the future,abandoning traditional national bargaining. &quot;If I'm stillaround, we will be doing something different,&quot; he said.   But there is a serious question as to how many of therail-union presidents will be around. This week, some topofficers of the Transportation Communications Union weredefeated for re-election at the union's convention, includingRichard Kilroy, TCU president and head of the Railway LaborExecutives Association, an umbrella group. He lost to RobertScardelletti, a TCU vice president and former unionrepresentative for Consolidated Rail Corp.   Mr. Kilroy had negotiated an early settlement for many ofhis clerks' union members, and was still criticized forsigning a study several years ago that suggested the clerksare highly paid.   Several other rail-union chiefs are up for re-election atconventions this summer, and ones including Mr. McFather andFred Hardin, the UTU president, who had assured his unionthat they didn't face a crew-size problem, are said to be introuble. Meantime, an effort has been mounted to recall themaintenance-of-way union's Mr. Fleming, who defeated theprevious incumbent a year ago.   &quot;The rank-and-file people are ready to get very tough withthe rail industry,&quot; a rail union official said. &quot;You have agrowing backlash.&quot; And they are starting to show theirunhappiness by &quot;electing new leadership,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
