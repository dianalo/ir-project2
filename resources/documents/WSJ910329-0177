Companies with hot new products or updates of classicprograms are doing well, whether they sell in the personalcomputer or mainframe computer markets, analysts add.</LP><TEXT>   Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., will become the firstsoftware company to achieve more than $500 million in revenuein a quarter, predicts Richard Sherlund, software analyst atGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. That would be up more than 60% from$310.9 million in the year-earlier quarter. The salesincrease will propel net income up 57% to $118 million or 95cents a share from $75.1 million or 62 cents, a year earlier,Mr. Sherlund said.   Mr. Sherlund said Microsoft Windows, the software thatgives IBM-compatible PCs a graphical screen appearance,continues to sell more copies each quarter. Moreover,customers are starting to buy Windows applications software,and Microsoft has a big head start in that field. The comingquarter will see Windows introduced in Japan and a newversion of Microsoft's operating system, MS-DOS 5.0, Mr.Sherlund predicts, promising continued growth.   Scott Smith of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette is slightlyless ebullient, predicting Microsoft will post a 51% revenuegain to $470 million and earnings closer to 92 cents a share.He said investors are concerned about Microsoft's potentiallegal problems, including its long-running dispute with AppleComputer Inc. over the appearance of Windows and a FederalTrade Commission investigation for possible antitrustviolations. But, he says, those issues &quot;won't have anyearnings impact this quarter.&quot;   Among other PC software firms, Lotus Development isexpected to report a sharp earnings decline. Goldman Sachs'sMr. Sherlund predicts net income will fall to about $6.5million, or 15 cents a share, from $22.8 million, or 53 centsa share. He believes revenue rose slightly to $170 millionfrom $165.5 million the year before. However, costs forresearch and development on new software and promotingexisting products soared.   In the second quarter, Lotus will get some benefit fromupgrading its character-based mainstay spreadsheet, 1-2-3Release 2.2. However, analysts don't expect a turnarounduntil Lotus starts shipping 1-2-3 for Windows, probably inJuly.   Numerous other PC companies will report strong gains thisquarter, analysts predict. Borland International Inc., ScottsValley, Calif., is expected to see sales and earnings nearlydouble, they say. Borland's spreadsheet and database programsare selling strongly and the company is being helped by itsprogramming language for Windows, introduced in December.   Symantec, Cupertino, Calif., is also growing rapidly.Donaldson Lufkin's Mr. Smith predicts earnings will riseabout 60% on a 55% revenue gain. He said Symantec has &quot;done agreat job&quot; in its acquisition of Peter Norton Utilities,which makes programs for finding lost files and detectingcomputer viruses.   David Bayer of Montgomery Securities says Aldus Corp., aSeattle-based maker of desktop publishing software, will&quot;have a fine quarter.&quot; He expects net income to rise 48% to39 cents a share on a 53% revenue gain to $39 million.Aldus's growth should continue next quarter when it bringsout a Windows version of its Persuasion software that helpspeople make business presentations, he added.   Computer Associates International Inc., Garden City, N.Y.,the second-biggest software company, will report earnings of35 cents a share, about equal to the year-earlier 36 cents ashare, Mr. Bayer predicts. Revenue is expected to rise toabout $390 million from $363 million. Mr. Smith said thecompany's utility software, which helps computer managersmanage their mainframes, is selling well. However, itsdatabase business, applications and PC business are &quot;allsoft,&quot; he added.   Oracle Corp., a Redwood City, Calif., maker of databasesoftware that mostly runs on midrange computers, alreadyreported a 50% earnings decline for its fiscal third quarterended Feb. 28, to $12.1 million, or nine cents a share, from$24.3 million, or 18 cents. Results included a $7 millionpretax charge related to accouting errors. Revenue rose 14%to $269 million from $236.4 million.   BMC Software Inc., Sugarland, Texas, another maker ofutility software for mainframes, will have a good quarter,predicts Mr. Sherlund. BMC software &quot;saves people a couple ofhours every time they load and unload a mainframe database,&quot;he says. He expects BMC's sales and earnings to rise nearly50%.</TEXT></DOC>
