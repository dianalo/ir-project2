Police also said officers may have to open fire on boat peopleif violence in the squalid camps worsens.   The comments came one day after boat people in the Chi Ma WanDetention Center armed with Molotov cocktails, homemade swords andstones attacked security forces sent to conduct a weapons search.   ``If police are attacked in closed quarters, police will bejustified to open fire,'' Barry Deegan, deputy Regional Commanderof the Marine Police, said at a news conference on the riot.   About half of the 3,227 boat people at the camp already havebeen denied refugee status and are considered illegal immigrantsfacing forced repatriation.   The Hong Kong government claims they do not qualify for refugeestatus because they did not flee persecution but instead sailedinto this British colony to seek a better life.   Since a first group of 51 boat people were forcibly repatriatedearlier this month, there have been several demonstrations againstthe program at Chi Ma Wan and other camps.   Police issued a statement today that said: ``Male inmates arebelieved to have prepared a number of contingency plans to counterany moves by the authorities to remove them.''   ``Such plans include lighting fires inside the camps, stoningthe authorities, arming themselves with homemade weapons andpossible hostage- taking,'' the statement said.   Deegan said some of these tactics were used Friday by boatpeople who threw stones, 40 Molotov cocktails and burning blanketsat police and prison officers. Other Vietnamese used swords andlances.   Police fired more than 140 tear gas cannisters to disperse themob, Deegan said. Fourteen boat people and 24 police officers andguards were injured. Twenty-five Vietnamese were arrested.   Prison officers found more than 700 weapons, many made fromwater pipes, laundry racks and bed posts.   About 44,000 Vietnamese who sailed into Hong Kong after mid-June1988 face repatriation if they cannot prove they fled persecution.Some 12,000 others in the camps who arrived earlier wereautomatically granted refugee status and can be resettled overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
