Gloom was especially thick in the long-term bond market. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds surged to nearly 9 1/2%, the highest level this year. That was up from 9.40% Wednesday and as low as 8.30% in February. Prices of some actively traded government bonds fell by more than half a point, or over $5 for each $1,000 face amount.    &quot;All the various measures of inflation are showing a decisive deterioration,&quot; said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Yesterday's government report &quot;certainly heightened concern about that,&quot; Thus, he said, interest rates &quot;will continue to climb.&quot; Morgan Stanley's chief economist, John D. Paulus, predicts that 30-year Treasury bond yields will increase to about 10% by year-end and as high as 11% early next year.    Interest rates also surged throughout Europe yesterday. West Germany's central bank raised its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 3 1/2%, to bolster the mark. The move was accompanied by rate increases in six other European countries. Many traders had expected the increase, and West German government bond prices finished mixed. British government issues fell but Japanese government bond prices bucked the trend and advanced.    Further signs of strong U.S. economic growth are expected to emerge from a Labor Department report next Friday on the nation's employment picture for August. If so, Federal Reserve officials may raise short-term interest rates further within a few weeks, several analysts said. They also predicted that banks will raise their prime, or base, rates again to 10 1/2% or 11% from the current 10% level.    Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley estimated that the economy will expand at a robust 4% annual clip in this year's second half. That pace, he said, &quot;is double what we think the economy's inflation-stable growth rate is.&quot;    Bond prices began to slump early yesterday when the Commerce Department reported that the economy expanded at a 3.3% annual rate in the second quarter, after adjusting for inflation. That was up from the 3.1% rate the department estimated last month, even though the drought is depressing the economy more than analysts had thought.    Traders were especially concerned by the Commerce Department's report that a broad measure of inflation called the deflator rose at a revised annual rate of 5.1%, up sharply from the first quarter's 1.7% pace. The second quarter rise, which previously was reported as 4.1%, was the largest gain since a 5.8% increase in the third quarter of 1982.    In addition, the report showed that another inflation measure, which measures the change in prices of a fixed basket of goods much as the consumer price index does, rose an unrevised 4.7% in the quarter, up from 3.5% in the first quarter.    Interest rates &quot;are headed higher,&quot; predicted H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. The Commerce Department report &quot;suggests substantial momentum in the economy.&quot; Also, he said the inflation outlook &quot;is deteriorating gradually and will continue to do so.&quot;    Treasury Securities   Although Treasury bond prices staged a mild rally yesterday afternoon, they still finished lower than Wednesday.    The Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds due in 2018 were quoted late in the day at 96 22/32, down from 97 1/4 Wednesday. The yield increased to 9.46%, the highest since Dec. 11, 1987. At one stage yesterday, the issue traded as low as 96 9/32 to yield 9 1/2%.    The Treasury's latest 10-year notes fell to 99 from 99 13/32. The yield rose to 9.41% from 9.34%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 4.26 points to close at 1196.27. It ranged between 1191.46 and 1197.31.    Rates rose on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month Treasury bill was quoted late yesterday at 7.28% bid, up from 7.23% Wednesday. The six-month Treasury bill rate rose to 7.48% bid from 7.46%.    The federal funds rate averaged 8.20% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. In the week ended Wednesday, the rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 8.02%. That was down from 8.19% the previous week but up from 7.75% the week before that, according to Richard Hoenig of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    The Treasury sold $9 billion of new 52-week bills yesterday at an average annual return of 7.72%. That was up from 7.40% at the previous sale last month and was the highest since 7.94% at an auction in May 1985.    Here are details of the Treasury bill sale:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                      52-Week    Applications                $32,376,990,000    Accepted bids                $9,003,550,000    Accepted at low price                    6%    Accepted noncompetitively      $462,690,000    Average price (Rate)         92.194 (7.72%)    High price (Rate)            92.194 (7.72%)    Low price (Rate)             92.184 (7.73%)    Coupon equivalent                     8.32%    The bills are dated Sept. 1 and mature Aug. 31, 1989.   Foreign Bonds   Another round of short-term interest rate increases swept through much of Europe yesterday.   West Germany's discount rate increase came after speculation all week that some increase in key rates was imminent to help bolster the mark. Traders registered little reaction to the increase, and prices of West German issues finished mixed.   The government's 6 3/4% issue due 1998 rose slightly to 99.65 from 99.60, while the yield dipped to 6.796% from 6.804%. But the European Investment Bank's 5 7/8% issue due 1998 finished the session at 98.40 bid, 0.15 point lower than Wednesday's close.   In London, though, prices of U.K. government bonds fell as base rates rose again. But the declines were small, mainly because of the continued shortage of new debt issues recently. The Treasury's 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 declined 1/4 point to 114 19/32 to yield 9.83%.   &quot;It is a remarkably good performance given the background,&quot; said John Shepperd, gilt analyst at Warburg Securities. Some analysts said the rise in base rates may have injected a certain amount of optimism that the government is tackling the country's inflation problems head on. &quot;People may be starting to look across the valley&quot; to the time when inflation is falling and rates are coming back down, Mr. Shepperd said.   Prices fell as much as 1/2 point earlier in the day in an immediate reaction to the trade and base rate news. However, dealers noted, without the shortage, prices would probably have dropped as much as one or two points.   In Tokyo, Japanese government bond prices strengthened near the close of trading. Commercial banks reportedly were active buyers. A stronger yen also helped give bond prices a boost.   The benchmark No. 105. 5% issue due 1997 closed at a yield of 5.19%, down 3.5 basis points on the day. The range on the session was 5.18% to 5.225%. The closing yield represented a price of 98.80, up 0.21 yen.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bond prices edged lower yesterday.   Prices tumbled as much as 5/8 point early in the day before stabilizing in the late morning and gradually firming as the afternoon progressed. Traders said bond prices didn't sink further because of the relatively light volume of new tax-free bonds recently.   A $100 million issue of Port Authority of New York and New Jersey revenue bonds dominated the new-issue market. A Bear Stearns andamp; Co. group submitted the winning bid for the bonds, with a bid that left the true interest cost to the issuer at 8.2601%.   The race for the issue was close, with the second place bid from a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. group putting the true interest cost at 8.26687%.   The $100 million issue was the Port Authority's first to contain serial bonds in 24 years, according to the authority's chairman, Philip Kaltenbacher. &quot;The use of serials broadens the market for Port Authority bonds by attracting investors interested in shorter maturities and achieves savings through lower short-term rates,&quot; he said.   Corporate Issues   Prices of corporate bonds were 1/8 to 1/4 point lower in light late trading.   Virginia Electric andamp; Power Co., a unit of Dominion Resources Inc., filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell $75 million of money-market preferred stock. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is lead underwriter.   This is just one of a number of auction-rate style preferred issues expected to come to market soon. Last week, Coca-Cola Co. announced plans to sell $300 million of money-market preferred.   Also, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., a unit of Transco Energy Co., filed a shelf offering with the SEC to sell up to $300 million of debt.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Mortgage securities rebounded slightly in late dealings as Treasury coupon prices firmed, but still ended about 6/32 to 3/8 point softer for the day.   The September Ginnie Mae 10% issue was quoted at 98 10/32 late, down 10/32 for the day, having edged as low as 98 6/32 during the course of the session.   By late yesterday afternoon the securities had a bond equivalent yield of 10.41% under a 12-year prepayment assumption, 102 basis points over the benchmark Treasury 10-year note. Late Wednesday, the spread between the two was 104 basis points.   Activity picked up in the derivative arena yesterday afternoon, with the pricing of a $400.4 million issue of Ryland Acceptance Corp. Four, Series 83, Remic mortgage securities. A Remic is a real-estate mortgage investment conduit.   The 12-class issue was backed by Fannie Mae's 9 1/2% issue with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 29.4 years and was marketed through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Fannie Mae's 9 1/2% issue ended at an intra-session high of 95 28/32, but still down 6/32 on the day.   Traders attributed the downward price bias of mortgage securities to a disappointing revision of second-quarter gross national product data, rate increases by European central banks and a softer dollar, as well as to the tepid performance by Treasurys.   Trading activity during the session was relatively light, as it has been for much of the week.</TEXT></DOC>
