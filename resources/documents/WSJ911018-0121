Birnbaum   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>10/18/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The House rejected a proposed ban on assaultweapons that was contained in an anti-crime bill, one dayafter 22 people were slain by a gunman in Killeen, Texas.   The 247-177 vote was a major victory for the gun lobby,which had complained that the proposed ban was an unfairinfringement on the right to bear arms. Gun-controladvocates, on the other hand, had sought the measure as whatthey said was a common-sense way of reducing the kind ofcarnage that resulted in Killeen.</LP><TEXT>   The gun lobby prevailed, however, on the strength of votesdrawn largely from rural districts and the West, which aretraditional strongholds of the National Rifle Association.The win came despite the expression of high hopes by mostlyurban lawmakers that the Texas tragedy might push some votestoward favoring of the ban.   The gun-control supporters even got a key convert at thestart of the vote: Democratic Rep. Chet Edwards, whosedistrict includes Killeen. &quot;Suddenly, the old arguments ringhollow,&quot; he said. &quot;`Guns don't kill, people do.' Explain thatto the families of victims mowed down eye-to-eye in coldblood with 17-bullet clips.&quot;   Advocates of the ban pushed this notion hard. &quot;Too manypeople are dying; there have been too many killings,&quot; saidRep. John Lewis (D., Ga.). The provision would have made itillegal to own or sell 13 domestically made semiautomaticweapons, as well as the large-capacity ammunition-feedingdevices they use.   There already is a ban on the importation of these typesof weapons.   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said the ban was designedto prevent criminals from obtaining guns &quot;made expressly forthe efficient killing of people&quot; and not hunting.   &quot;These weapons are not for hunting,&quot; agreed Rep. ButlerDerrick (D., S.C.), who said he is opposed to broad-scaledgun control. He added that &quot;it is absurd&quot; to allow the saleof such assualt weapons. &quot;I'm just amazed that we are evenhere debating it,&quot; he said.   But lawmakers who opposed the ban said the guns used atKilleen probably wouldn't have been affected by the measure.They also contended that the provision was imprecisely drawnand wouldn't reduce crime. The provision &quot;will not stoppeople from killing people,&quot; said Rep. Bill Sarpalius (D.,Texas). &quot;Why don't we outlaw hammers and baseball bats?&quot;   Keeping the ban, asserted Rep. Ron Marlenee (R., Mont.),would send the Congress &quot;down the slippery road of guncontrol.&quot;   The bill, a major priority of President Bush, wouldtoughen anti-crime and anti-drug programs. The House isscheduled to resume debate on the bill next week. The Senateearlier passed its version of the legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
