Of five scheduled GOP debates and joint appearances in the campaign so far, Vice President Bush has appeared in only two of them and Sen. Dole in three, according to the calculations of other campaigns. Moreover, both candidates have made it a point not to respond to attacks from their lesser-known rivals, such as former Gov. Pete du Pont and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig (who especially swipe at Mr. Bush) and Rep. Jack Kemp (who often goes after Mr. Dole).    In general, it is the vice president who has been the most gun-shy: He has even refused to appear in an hourlong public television interview with Harvard University's Marvin Kalb -- a rite that all 12 other presidential candidates are participating in. Sen. Dole, meanwhile, has made it a practice to bow out of most multicandidate appearances when Mr. Bush won't be there.    The vice president's strategy has been to keep himself above the fray as much as possible, minimizing any chance that he will make a mistake. At the same time, his strategy has reduced his opponents' ability to take him on as a political equal and makes it harder for the lesser-known candidates to attract public attention.    &quot;It's clear that Bush wants to keep that cocoon zipped up as snugly as possible,&quot; says John Buckley, the spokesman for Rep. Kemp's campaign. With the pace of the campaign now heating up, the two leaders will be stepping up their appearances: At least four more debates are scheduled between now and March. But Mr. Buckley frets that damage has already been done to his man, who is lagging at single digits in national polls. By refusing to participate in any debates at all until last Oct. 28, Mr. Bush and Mr. Dole &quot;effectively delayed the start of the campaign until four months before the Iowa caucuses, which is to the advantage of the better-known candidates,&quot; Mr. Buckley says.    Mari Maseng, Sen. Dole's press secretary, says that, since Sen. Dole views the GOP race as a two-man contest between himself and the vice president, debates without the vice president hold little attraction for him. &quot;You want to get the most bang for your buck,&quot; she says. &quot;We like to contrast Sen. Dole with George Bush whenever possible.&quot;    Similarly, the Bush campaign offers no apologies for its reluctance to schedule more debates and interviews. &quot;The only thing I would say is whatever strategy we have is working a hell of a lot better than theirs,&quot; says Bush spokesman Peter Teeley.    Mr. Teeley says the vice president's reluctance to accept more debates with his foes is primarily a function of scheduling. &quot;We've got 300 interview requests, and some people are going to get it and some people aren't,&quot; he says.    But Mr. Kalb, a former television newsman who now runs Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy, thinks the Bush approach is hypocritical. &quot;There is a complaint on the part of so many candidates that they lack, through the press, an opportunity for a serious discourse on the issues,&quot; he says, and yet Mr. Bush refused the opportunity to sit down with him for a one-on-one interview that would have allowed such a discourse.    Mr. Kalb says that a Bush aide told him the campaign was concerned &quot;about a preppy image that any appearance at Harvard might worsen.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Campaign '88: Bush and Dole, the Preppie and the Plebeian, Campaign From Opposite Sides of the Tracks...&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 7, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
