He comes in the dugout and he tells me, 'I wasjust trying to hit it in the hole.' So, I don't know if he really understandswhat he's doing,&quot; said Minnesota Twins Manager Tom Kelly.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GAGNE'S HOMER AN ACCIDENT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Notebook; World Series Game 1: Twins 5, Braves 2  </MEMO><TEXT>     Gagne, the Twins' No. 9 hitter, was looking to drive the ball between firstand second when he stepped to the plate in the fifth with runners on first andthird. Instead, he sent Charlie Leibrandt's 0-and-1 pitch flying over theleft-field fence.;   &quot;I've got to be aggressive. I've got to keep the ball inagainst right-handers, keep them away from my change-up. I just didn't get theball in enough this time,&quot; said Leibrandt.; KEEPING HIS WORD: Kelly made firstbaseman Kent Hrbek sound good in the postgame interview sessions.;   &quot;In theclubhouse, he told everybody to get on board, he was going to carry the loadtonight. So, I said, 'Well, let me change the lineup quick, and I'll get youup in the fourth spot,' &quot; said Kelly. &quot;Lo and behold, he came through.&quot;;  Kelly left Hrbek in the seventh slot against Leibrandt, a left-hander, andHrbek went 2 for 4 with a double, a 440-foot homer to right and two runs.Hrbek was 3 for 21 in the American League playoffs.;   &quot;He forgot to tell youthat every game in the ALCS I was saying the same thing. Tonight it happenedto work,&quot; Hrbek said.; GLAVINE'S RETORT: Atlanta Braves pitcher Tom Glavineshot down reports that he'd told Manager Bobby Cox he was too tired to startGame 1. Glavine will start Game 2 tonight.;   &quot;I read that in the paper today,and I had nothing to do with it. It was suggested that I went to Bobby andbegged for an extra day's rest,&quot; Glavine said. &quot;There's really no validity tothat whatsoever. My arm feels fine. I was ready to pitch in relief the othernight in Pittsburgh, and I was in the bullpen.;   &quot; . . . I was ready to pitchthen, and I was ready to pitch today.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KIM BOATMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Minneapolis  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911020  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  393  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 20, 199100294214,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
