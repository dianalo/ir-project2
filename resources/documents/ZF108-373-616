(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Scanners andamp; OCRsandM;Optical character recognition systems and image scanners have won a footholdin the office.andP;  But every prospective buyer should study their limitationsand cost compared with manual input.andP;  OCR can input huge quantities of datafor which perfect accuracy is not essential.andM;OCR also does a good job on a range of documents if it has the rightrecognition software for their type fonts.andP;  Some optical character readerscan be trained to recognize new fonts.andM;Scanners also have earned their place as input devices.andP;  A scanner works bymeasuring light reflected from an image with a photodetector array.andP;  Itsaccuracy depends on the intensity levels measured and the number of spots oflight reflected from each inch of image.andP;  From these measurements, softwarebuilt into a dedicated interface board digitizes the image.andM;Scanners almost always need hard-disk storage because they need big programsto manipulate images, and even the simplest image contains a large amount ofdata.andP;  One typed page equals about a 3K ASCII text file.andP;  The same imagedigitized at 300 dots per inch (dpi) makes a file 10 to 100 times larger.andP;  Ahigh-quality color image may generate a file bigger than 1M.andM;Images captured by scanners often are stored directly onto large write-onceoptical drives.andP;  They also can be captured by desktop publishingapplications.andP;  Or OCR software can convert their textual information intoASCII and other machine-usable forms.andM;Offset printing of color or high-resolution images requires a scanner pricedat $ 10,000 or more.andP;  But simpler 256-gray-scale, 300-dpi scanners can makeperfectly good desktop publishing images out of photographers and can supplydigitized image data to an OCR program.andM;Near the low price end, Panasonic Communications and Systems Co.'s $1,600FX-RS 506 comes with OCR software that recognizes either proportionallyspaced, typed or dot-matrix characters and scans at 400 dpi.andM;From Flatbed to HandheldandM;Scanner categories include flatbed, sheetfed, flatbed with sheetfedattachments or handheld.andP;  Ricoh Corp. makes an unusual scanner with the headmounted on an arm to scan three-dimensional objects.andM;A flatbed device scans documents lying on a flat piece of glass.andP;  It can haveeither a moving scan-head carrier or a complex array of optics.andP;  This typecan handle either large or small items and does the best job on boundmaterials.andM;A sheetfed scanner is excellent for large quantities of unbound documents ofsimilar size and format, although most buyers prefer the versatile flatbedscanner with a power-feed attachment.andM;Some flatbed scanners have optical light attachments to process largetransparencies.andP;  There are specialty scanners for digitizing 35-millimeterslide images.andM;Handheld scanners come in two varieties.andP;  The more common type measures 3 to4 inches wide and can scan either images or columns of text.andP;  The other kindof hand unit scans individual words or numbers.andP;  Because the human user movesthe scanner, it need not have the same precision moving parts as flatbed orpage scanners.andP;  That reduces the price but also makes operator skill crucial.andM;The line scanner has a mission different from all the others.andP;  It inputsselected data directly into application programs.andP;  A variation on this type,the powered line scanner, reads check codes or ZIP codes on envelopes.andM;Scanning in ColorandM;Until recently, desktop scanners could do only black-and-white or gray-scalescanning.andP;  Now inexpensive color scanners are coming to market at the sametime that wax-transfer printers are making it practical to produce colordocuments on the desktop.andM;Starting around $2,600 with Microtek Lab Inc.'s combination gray-scale/colorscanner, the prices of color scanners climb high.andP;  But they seldom includecompatible software to integrate scanned images into desktop publishingprograms, as most black-and-white scanners do.andM;Color scanning is at least three times more complex than black and white orgray scale.andP;  It involves measuring variable intensities of three differentcolors rather than simple shades of gray.andP;  That means more complex softwareas well as larger storage and processing requirements.andM;Writing practical OCR software has turned out to be a major hurdle fordevelopers.andP;  What the human eye and brain can understand easily has provedquite difficult for computers.andP;  In fact, the task is so computation-intensivethat no general-application OCR software exists for machines slower than the80386.andM;The Macintosh II and 80386-based bystems do OCR reasonably fast even wthout adedicated processor board; most of the accessory boards for turning slowermachines into OCR platforms have Motorola Inc. 680x0 microprocessors.andM;OCR systems generally work best on typewritten or daisywheel-printed text.andO;OCR software reads equal-spaced and PostScript fonts with high accuracy,although typeset material like this article proves difficult.andM;Until recently, the only scanners for less than $ 11,000 that could readtypeset material well were from Kurzweil Computer Products Inc.andP;  Othermachines that could read typeset text were not micro-based and thus were veryexpensive.andM;Inexpensive OCR ProgramsandM;Now the situation is changing, with OCR programs that handle both typesettext and column formats for less than $1,000.andM;Two important entries in fully automatic micro-based OCR are Caere Corp.'sOmniPage software for the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh, and Calera (formerlyPalantir) Recognition Systems Inc.'s TrueScan for the PC and TopScan for theMac.andM;Because so much typeset text appears in columns, it is important for OCRsoftware to be able to determine automatically what portion of an imagecontains text and what contains images.andP;  As late as a year ago, most OCRsystems forced the user to specify the text area and sometimes even the typefont.andM;Fully automatic programs like OmniPage, which can sort out text columns, typesizes and even images within text, have made general desktop OCR much morepractical.andP;  The Xerox/Kurzweil machines that sold for $10,000-plus two yearsago have improved their column support, and prices have fallen dramatically.andM;With ASCII file output as an option, OCR files can be imported into nearlyevery micro-based word processor, desktop publisher or database.andP;  Most OCRprograms also offer a choice of one or more common word processing formats,so that scanned files retain their original characteristics such asunderlining and tabs.andM;However, database input is more complex because of requirements for fieldsize, record length and data consistency.andP;  In full-text databases, there islittle need to modify files; sometimes text for CD-ROM publication isacceptable even as scanned.andP;  But certain applications need extensive editingfor accuracy or format.andM;If a scanner collects data for databases or spreadsheets, the text producedby the OCR program usually needs heavy editing.andP;  That job can consume so muchtime that it renders OCR impractical for data entry.andM;Editing DutyandM;The single-line handheld OCR scanner works well for getting data intospreadsheet cells or database fields.andP;  Memory-resident software recognizesthe characters and puts them at the cursor location on-screen.andM;Saba Technologies, vendor of the inexpensive HandScan, was bought by SoriconCorp., which has announced but not yet marketed the DataSweep, a pencil-like,single-letter scanner with the same technology as the HandScan.andM;What should buyers keep in mind when buying OCR?andP;  As always, speed comesfirst.andP;  If the device works too slowly or the resulting file needs muchediting, hand keying will be more practical.andP;  However, fast OCR processingdoes not necessarily imply investment in a fast host computer.andP;  Some OCRsystems use the host for all processing, so their scanning time does dependalmost entirely on the computer.andP;  But if the OCR system has a dedicatedprocessor board, the host's speed makes little difference to OCR throughput.andM;Buyers may be able to save here by pressing an otherwise obsolete computerinto service as an OCR host.andM;Scanners like the CompuScan inc. PCS contain a dedicated high-speed processorand are in effect special-purpose OCR computers.andM;For scanners that do rely on the host, changing the software to recognizemore fonts is relatively simple.andP;  Self-contained units usually requirereplacement of some memory chips.andM;Artificial intelligence features now are appearing in OCR to detect unlikelylettter combinations or out-of-place numbers, but these are far fromperfected.andM;The basic buying decisions are first, whether to get a fast sheetfed scanneror a more versatile flatbed scanner; and second, whether to buy gray-scalecapability for editing images.andP;  A $3,000 scanner may not do any better on agiven job than an $800 scanner.andM;Base your buying decision on actual tests, not on the error rate claims ofmanufacturers.andP;  It is impossible to choose the best scanner for a particulartask just by looking at product specifications.andM;The most expensive product does not necessarily work best; a unit thatperforms one task well may fail miserably at the next.andP;  Also, tests do notalways turn out equally well on similar images, especially photos.andM;For offices that deal with many different document and image types, it may besufficient just to match the resolution of the scanner to the printer thatwill be used, and maker certain the software will store images in a fileformat compatible with existing graphics software.andM;Deciding to BuyandM;OCR buying decisions are more difficult.andP;  Once again, it is up to the buyerto determine whether the software supports the types of text to be scannedand whether it can handle columns.andP;  In the under-$10,000 category, testing iscritical to find out which package works best with your documents.andM;The choice is easier if an office handles many different documents -- only anomnifont OCR system can read multiple type fonts, and few omnifonts areavailable.andM;Certain other important purchasing factors may not be obvious to people whohave not worked with scanners and OCR's before.andP;  For example, the chances ofquickly reproducing a good scanned image of a photograph are relatively low;line art reproduces somewhat better.andP;  Why is that so?andM;Printers simulate different shades of gray by varying the frequency of blackdots, not by using gray ink.andP;  Halftone reproduction produces grays byprinting each picture element or pixel as a different-size black dot.andO;Because these dots are so small and close together, the human eye cannotresolve them.andP;  Instead, the brain interprets the object as an image in shadesof gray.andM;Most laser printers cannot vary the sizes of individual dots.andP;  The scannersoftware must &quot;dither&quot; the images, or drop out points, to stimulate shades ofgray.andM;The results of dithering can be strikingly good.andP;  But whether a photographwill reproduce well depends less on the quality of the scanner than onwhether the dithering algorithm is a match for that particular image.andM;Most scanner software offers a choice of dithering methods, and there is noway to predict which will work best for a given image.andP;  This often results inspending a lot of time printing out images different ways to see which onelooks best.andM;With so many printing variations and different settings possible in theoriginal scan, there could be hundreds of different ways to scan andreproduce an image -- a far cry from an easy-sounding scan-and-print.andM;Imagine the ImageryandM;for many applications, it is vital to be able to manipulate and edit theimages.andP;  But buyers should understand clearly the amount of work and involvedin getting an images just right.andM;Line art or drawings in black ink reproduce well with nearly any scranner;the main purchasing consideration is whether the scanner's resolution matchesthe printer's.andM;If the laser printer prints at 400 dpi, a 200-dpi scanner will not turn out agood result.andP;  Conversely, a 400-dpi scanner cannot make a 300-dpi printerimage look any better.andP;  But most scanners have several resolutions.andM;In evaluating scanners for continuous-tone images such as photographs, thesavvy buyer runs actual sample images on various scanners, then prints themout.andP;  If the photos vary a great deal, the tests will be valid only for thoseparticular samples.andP;  However, testing still is a good idea because somescanners take up to 20 times longer to scan a photograph than others, andlong scan times do not guarantee better results.andM;A final point about scanner resolution: If prices are not all that different,the buyer may make a mistake by choosing a 300- or 400-dpi scanner with thehighest possible number of gray-scale levels.andP;  That quickly runs up a storagedeficit if users do a lot of scanning and keep an image database.andM;Every high-resolution image takes up several megabytes.andP;  Even a 100M harddisk fill fast, and then the organization has to buy a WORM drive or erasableoptical disk, each costing more than the scanner.andM;If a scanner will serve as an input device for optical character recognition,the situation grows more complex.andM;So many OCR software packages are available that it is essential to testactual documents before committing to a particular OCR system.andP;  Again, thetests have little value unless they involve a realistic variety of documents.andM;In evaluating a small OCR system, consider how it will be used.andP;  Most PC andMacintosh systems need constant operator attention and take about two minutesper page to scan in a relatively simple document like a letter.andM;In my recent tests of an excellent system made up of a Macintosh IIcx, AppleComputer Inc. scanner and Caere Corp. OmniPage software, it took me about 30seconds to scan a typed page.andP;  OCR recognition was not complete for aboutanother minute and a half.andP;  Scan/OCR time totaled about three minutesincluding setup and file storage tasks.andM;When scanned text files require some editing, as is the case with mostdocuments, it actually may take longer to scan a series of short documentsthan for a competent typist to rekey them.andM;OCR systems should not be regarded as a panacea.andP;  Despite advertised errorrates as low as 0.1 percent, the average magazine page after scanning willdisplay lots of errors, some of which probably can be lived with.andP;  Others maybe unacceptable depending on the application in question.andM;Dealing With RealityandM;Simple documents typed on good paper with fixed margins, even spacing and nospecial characters approach perfect OCR recognition.andP;  But most documents donot turn out like that.andM;A scanned 150-page report contains about 40,000 words or 200,000 characters,which yield about 2,000 errors at a reasonable error rate of 1 percent.andM;Although 2,000 sounds like a lot of errors, they may not be that baddepending on how important they are and how much it costs to correct them.andM;If a document is non-technical or is being scanned just for quick reference,a couple of thousand errors substituting, say, the letter O for the number 0may be acceptable.andM;But if the document is a contract or a budget, even the tiniest errormatters.andP;  It may take almost as long to check and correct a scanned documentas to key it by hand in the first place.andM;If the scanned text will be input into a word processor, it might be betterto choose software that can create compatible files rather than just ASCIIfiles.andM;Speed means more than simple throughput.andP;  While many OCRs are faster than theold CompuScan PCS machines, for example, few if any Macintosh orPC-compatible systems scan a stack of pages as flawlessly as the PCS.andM;Also, someone must tend a flatbed or small-capacity sheetfed scannercontinuously.andM;For large quantities of typewritten documents it is hard to beat the PCS,which can run unattended for 30 minutes.andM;John McCormick, a free-lance writer and computer consultant, has been workingwith computers since the early 1960s.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
