The action, filed in Orange County Superior Court, claims that the parties named in the suit participated in a scheme to transfer assets of Irvine-based Helionetics when Downey had been entitled to receive the assets from guarantees on its $4.5 million note.    Bank of America is a unit of San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp. Arthur Andersen was Helionetics's auditor until August 1986. Also named in the suit are Bernard Katz, former chairman of Helionetics, and HLX Laser Inc.    The suit claims that the assets were transferred to HLX Laser and also claims that HLX is jointly owned by Mr. Katz and Helionetics. Helionetics is currently operating under bankruptcy-law protection.    The suit seeks to recover the note plus interest and asks for $150 million in punitive damages. The suit also names Helionetics's employee stock ownership plan, the original borrower of the note, which was guaranteed by the company.    Executives of Helionetics didn't return telephone calls. HLX Laser and Mr. Katz couldn't be reached.    Kim Floyd, director of administration in Arthur Andersen's Los Angeles office, said the auditing firm hadn't seen the suit and wouldn't comment.    In San Francisco, a spokesman for BankAmerica declined to comment on the charges, because &quot;we haven't had a chance to study the suit.&quot;    In the suit, the thrift claims Bank of America, holder of a $12.5 million note from Helionetics, &quot;induced&quot; Downey to issue the $4.5 million note in 1984 to ease the risk of Bank of America's own note. The bank signed an agreement giving Downey a share in the secured assets of Helionetics, the suit says. The suit claims Downey wasn't informed that the assets of Helionetics's &quot;most profitable division&quot; were transferred to HLX later that year.    After the ESOP defaulted on the note, Helionetics declined to provide collateral last April, thereby defaulting on the note. Downey sought to foreclose on Helionetics's collateral, and the company filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code last August.    Helionetics's Chapter 11 filing listed assets of $33 million as of last May 31 and liabilities of $21.5 million, including $17.5 million held by secured creditors.    Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate with protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debt. </TEXT></DOC>
