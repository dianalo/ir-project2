In recent days, crude oil futures prices have soared to a14-month high. The February contract for West Texas Intermediate,the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled Tuesday at $18.95 abarrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 7 cents a barrel onthe day.   The last time the contract for the nearby month settled higherwas Nov. 5, 1987 when the price at the end of the trading dayreached $18.98 a barrel. At that time, there were concerns that theIran-Iraq war could seriously disrupt shipments of crude from thePersian Gulf.   The price of the near-month contract for West Texas Intermediatenow stands sharply higher than last autumn. On Oct. 5, the nearbycontract sank to an intraday low of $12.28 a barrel.   Analysts say the markets lately have derived support from aseries of factors deemed promising for the price outlook,particularly speculation that OPEC nations would be able to curbtheir crude oil production.   Jim Fiedler, a vice president at E.D.andamp;F. Man InternationalFutures Inc., said market operators are not necessarily confidentthat an output accord will come out of a meeting beginning Jan. 26in London between members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries and non-OPEC countries.   But, they do not expect the meeting to produce any negative newsfor the oil markets either, he said.   The nearby West Texas Intermediate contract reached a high of$19.21 during the session before traders began to sell to collectprofits amassed during the recent advance.   Gasoline contracts in the more distant months benefited frombuying partly based on thinking that new environmentalspecifications due to take effect this year could restrictavailability in the future. Buying in gasoline spilled over into thecrude oil contracts, brokers said.   The February contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.19 cent tosettle at 51.10 cents a gallon.   Among other refined products traded on the New York MercantileExchange, the February contract for No. 2 heating oil slipped 0.11cent to 53.05 cents a gallon.</TEXT></DOC>
