The balloting was to have been a vote to choose a successor tothe frail, 80-year-old nun who is known as the ``saint of thegutters'' for her work with the destitute and the poor.   ``I was expecting to be free, but God has his own plans,''Mother Teresa said when she met reporters for the first time afterSaturday's election.   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate withdrew her decision to stepdown as superior general of the Missionaries of Charity afterballots were cast by 103 delegates summoned from missions aroundthe globe.   Calcutta's Vicar General Monsignor Francis Gomes, who presidedover the secret balloting, said Mother Teresa had little choice butto accept the unanimous vote.   Mother Teresa said she had been firm on stepping down _ untilthe balloting forced her to change her decision. ``These thingscannot be decided beforehand,'' she said.   In March, Pope John Paul II said he was bowing to MotherTeresa's wish to retire from the top post of the order she founded.He had rejected her earlier requests to step aside.   Mother Teresa suffered a nearly fatal heart attack a year ago.She returned to work but asked for retirement within a few months.   Asked if she would slow down her pace of work, Mother Teresareplied: ``We have sisters who are capable of helping.''   But she said she would continue to travel according to the needsof her group.   Along with Mother Teresa, four aides were elected. SisterFredrick, a Maltese nun who previously was head of the charity'sU.S. chapter based in Washington, was elected as Mother Teresa'sdeputy.   Mother Teresa was elected to a further six-year term.   The Yugoslav-born Roman Catholic nun began her work in earnestfor the poor and helpless 43 years ago in the gutters of Calcutta,India's most densely populated city in the eastern state of WestBengal.   Mother Teresa gave up a comfortable teaching job at a Catholicschool to set up a series of homes for the dying in Calcutta andeventually throughout the world.   Today, the Missionaries of Charity operate 430 homes in 95countries for lepers, cripples, abandoned babies and others with noplace to turn.   Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
