The guerrillas' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front hascalled for a boycott of Sunday's election and threatened electionworkers who take part. Their clandestine Radio Venceremos warnedanew that the rebels are ready to enforce a ban on trafficthroughout the nation beginning Thursday.   ``Elections with repression aren't elections,'' read bannerscarried Tuesday by peasants, workers and students from the Bread,Land, Jobs and Liberty Movement, which supports the Farabundo Martiin its war against the U.S.-backed government.   Fidel Chavez Mena, presidential nominee of the incumbentChristian Democratic Party, told a news conference, ``The FMLN hasno right to keep the people from voting.''   The guerrillas are no longer ``the Robin Hoods they used to be.They no longer have popular support,'' he said.   The nine-year war has killed about 70,000 people, most of themcivilians.   Honduran Col. Reynaldo Andino Flores told a news conference inTegucigalpa, the capital of neighboring Honduras, on Tuesday thatmembers of the Farabundo Marti have set up training camps inHonduran territory.   Andino Flores, commander of the 105th Infantry Brigade, accusedthe Salvadoran rebels of using refugee camps in Honduras to trainHonduran and Salvadorans in guerrilla combat.   He also charged that Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista army has beenusing the camps to transport arms to the Salvadoran rebels.   Honduran officials have charged in the past that the FarabundoMarti has used the camps occupied by Salvadoran refugees to traintroops.   ``The connection that exists between the FMLN and Nicaragua'sSandinista army is evident,'' Andino Flores said.   He said the Farabundo Marti operates out of six different pointsalong the El Salvador-Honduras border.   Andino Flores said his men found in the camps ``leftist elementsdedicated to making war equipment and storing medicines for theFMLN.''   For eight years, more than 20,000 Salvadorans have lived inrefugee border camps in Colomoncagua, 335 miles west of Tegucigalpa.   In El Salvador, the guerrillas continued weeklong attacks onelectrical installations Monday, blowing up power poles andtransformers. Half of this small Central American country waswithout power Tuesday, a spokesman for the electric company said.   Many of Tuesday's 700 demonstrators marched quietly. Others _gripping tape-wrapped steel bars, their faces covered withhandkerchiefs _ spray-painted slogans on walls and pavementdenouncing the elections and the United States.   When they ran low on paint, several helped themselves to more athardware stores. Shopkeepers said they took without paying.   A pharmacy was robbed of pills, telephones in a fast-foodrestaurant were smashed, buses were sprayed with slogans and seizedby demonstrators.   Asked why he was marching, a 9-year-old replied softly, ``For therevolution.''   The Farabundo Marti offered to participate in the elections andrecognize the results if voting was postponed and other conditionswere met. It considered the government response inadequate anddemanded a boycott.   A few hours after the march, several thousand Salvadorans held amore peaceful election protest in the plaza in front of the hulking,still-unfinished cathedral.   ``Elections in wartime are elections for the war,'' peoplechanted, waving flags with the blue and white national colors.``Dialogue and negotiation for peace in El Salvador.''   The rally was organized by the Permanent Committee for A NationalDebate, a church-sponsored effort to find a peaceful end to the war.   Urban guerrillas ambushed a Treasury Police patrol and woundedthree men late Monday. Other rebels stopped a soft drink truck andset it afire Tuesday.   Noise bombs exploded throughout the capital, sending thousands ofpamphlets into the air urging an election boycott.   Persistent electrical outages and vandalism have increasedsupport for the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, known asArena. Its candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, is favored to win theelection.   Chavez Mena said a ``vote for Arena is a vote for the FMLNbecause the FMLN has said it would rather fight the extreme rightbecause it feels it can win.   ``Arena will polarize the country.''   Neither party, nor the third-running leftist DemocraticConvergence, is expected to win a first-round victory Sunday. Ifneeded, a runoff would be held in April.</TEXT></DOC>
