As we urged last year in Toronto, the Paris Club reached aconsensus in September 1988 on the conditions of implementation ofsignificant reduction of debt service payments for the poorestcountries. Thirteen countries have already benefited by thisdecision.   28. We welcome the increasing grant element in the developmentassistance as well as the steps taken to convert loans into grantsand we urge further steps to this end. Flexibility in developmentaid as much as in debt rescheduling is required.   29. We attach great importance to the efficient and successfulpreparation of the next general conference of the United Nations onthe least developed countries, which will take place in Paris in1990.</TEXT><NOTE>STRENGTHENED DEBT STRATEGY FOR THE HEAVILY INDEBTED COUNTRIES</NOTE><TEXT>   30. Our approach to the debt problems has produced signficantresults, but serious challenges remain: In many countries the ratioof debt service to exports remains high, financing for growthpromoting investment is scarce, and capital flight is a key problem.An improvement in the investment climate must be a critical part ofefforts to achieve a sustainable level of growth without excessivelevels of debt. These improvements of the current situation dependabove all on sustained and effective adjustment policies in thedebtor countries.   31. To address these challenges, we are strongly committed to thestrengthened debt strategy. This will rely, on a case-by-case basis,on the following actions:   _Borrowing countries should implement, with the assistance of theFund and the Bank, sound economic policies, particularly designed tomobilize savings, stimulate investment and reverse capital flight;   _Banks should increasingly focus on voluntary, market-based debtand debt service reduction operations, as a complement to newlending;   _The International Monetary Fund and World Bank will supportsignificant debt reduction by setting aside a portion ofpolicy-based loans;   _Limited interest support will be provided, through additionalfinancing by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, fortransactions involving significant debt and debt service reduction.For that purpose the use of escrow accounts is agreed;   _Continued Paris Club rescheduling and flexibility ofexport-credit agencies;   _Strengthening of the international financial institutionscapability for supporting medium-term macroeconomic and structuraladjustment programs and for compensating the negative effects ofexport shortfalls and external shocks.   32. In the framework of this strategy:   _We welcome the recent decisions taken by the two institutions toencourage debt and debt service reduction which provide adequateresources for these purposes;   _We urge debtor countries to move ahead promptly to developstrong economic reform programs that may lead to debt and debtservice reductions in accordance with the guidelines defined by thetwo Bretton Woods institutions;   _We urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches intheir negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly toconclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction,debt service reduction and new money. We stress that officialcreditors should not substitute for private lenders. Our governmentsare prepared to consider as appropriate tax, regulatory andaccounting practices with a view to eliminating unnecessaryobstacles to debt and debt service reductions.</TEXT><NOTE>ENVIRONMENT</NOTE><TEXT>   33. There is growing awareness throughout the world of thenecessity to preserve better the global ecological balance. Thisincludes serious threats to the atmosphere, which could lead tofuture climate changes. We note with great concern the growingpollution of air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas; acid rain;dangerous substances; and the rapid desertification anddeforestation. Such environmental degradation endangers species andundermines the well-being of individuals and societies.   Decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect theEarth's ecological balance. We will work together to achieve thecommon goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environmentin order to meet shared economic and social objectives and to carryout obligations to future generations.   34. We urge all countries to give further impetus to scientificresearch on environmental issues, to develop necessary technologiesand to make clear evaluations of the economic costs and benefits ofenvironmental policies.   The persisting uncertainty on some of these issues should notunduly delay our action.   In this connection, we ask all countries to combine their effortsin order to improve observation and monitoring on a global scale.   35. We believe that international cooperation also needs to beenhanced in the field of technology and technology transfer in orderto reduce pollution or provide alternative solutions.   36. We believe that industry has a crucial role in preventingpollution at source, in waste minimization, in energy conservation,and in the design and marketing of cost-effective cleantechnologies. The agricultural sector must also contribute totackling problems such as water pollution, soil erosion anddesertification.   37. Environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade,development, energy, transport, agriculture and economic planning.Therefore, environmental considerations must be taken into accountinto economic decision-making. In fact, good economic policies andgood environmental policies are mutually reinforcing.   In order to achieve sustainable development, we shall ensure thecompatibility of economic growth and development with the protectionof the environment. Environmental protection and related investmentshould contribute to economic growth. In this respect, intensifiedefforts for technological breakthrough are important to reconcileeconomic growth and environmental policies.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
