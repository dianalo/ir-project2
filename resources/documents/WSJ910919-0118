The government and the Public Service Alliance of Canada,which represents the government workers, agreed to resumenegotiations for a new contract.</LP><TEXT>   As the picket lines withdrew from government buildings,however, auto makers and other manufacturers were hit by anew protest action involving truckers. Traffic was tied up atthe Canada-U.S. border crossing in Windsor, Ont., by a truckblockade. The protest was against the high cost of doingbusiness in Canada, which has driven many companies out ofbusiness.   As the government workers returned to their jobs, loadingof grain vessels resumed at Canadian ports. A total of 34vessels were waiting to take on about one million metric tonsof grain at the west coast ports of Vancouver and PrinceRupert. Another 12 ships were due to arrive this week. ACanadian Wheat Board spokesman said the board, which marketsCanadian wheat and barley, may have to reschedule somedeliveries.   Gilles Loiselle, the cabinet minister responsible for thegovernment employees, reaffirmed that the government wouldn'timprove its wage offer, which would impose a freeze on wagesthis year and limit next year's increase to 3%. Mr. Loiselle,however, agreed to shelve back-to-work legislation pendingthe outcome of negotiations.   If the government were to back down on its wage stand, itwould undermine its anti-inflation policy, said Patti Croft,an economist with Toronto-based Burns Fry Ltd. The governmentaims to reduce inflation, as measured by the consumer priceindex, to 3% by the end of 1992, 2 1/2% by mid-1994 and 2% bythe end of 1995.   The federal government has to maintain a united front withprovincial governments, eight of which also have imposed wagerestraints on their employees, said Susan Clark, chiefeconomist at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.   The government restraints have helped slow the rise inCanadian wages in recent months. Major collective agreementsreached in July provided for an average increase in base wagerates of 2.5%, down from 5.1% in June, the Labor Departmentsaid.   In a separate labor dispute, Toronto's bus and subwaysystems remained shut yesterday because of a week-long strikeby the city's public transit workers. The employees are tovote today on a new contract offer.   The border action by truckers disrupted operations by theCanadian subsidiaries of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.and Chrysler Corp., which sent shift workers home early fromseveral assembly plants because shipments of auto parts weredelayed.</TEXT></DOC>
