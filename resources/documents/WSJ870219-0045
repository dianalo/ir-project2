The announcement came two weeks after General Motors Corp. told members of its hourly work force that they would get no profit-sharing payments for last year, and union officials have said the disparity will be a major issue in the United Auto Workers' contract talks with the two companies later this year.    &quot;I think there's no question that poses a problem,&quot; Peter Laarman, a union spokesman, said in an interview earlier this month. &quot;The UAW has generally tried to keep compensation and benefit programs in relative alignment.&quot;    In a statement released after the Ford announcement, the UAW didn't specifically address the differences in profit sharing. Stephen P. Yokich, union vice president, said he was &quot;pleased that . . . workers will share in a slice of the profit pie.&quot; But he criticized Ford, saying that some of its profits have come &quot;at the expense of the UAW work force,&quot; including the &quot;transfer of work traditionally done at home to other countries.&quot;    Donald E. Petersen, Ford chairman, disclosed the $370 million payout, which will be distributed March 11 to eligible hourly and salaried employees, in a speech broadcast live to plants and offices on the company's internal television network. &quot;This year's profit-sharing payment is a well-deserved award,&quot; Mr. Petersen told the workers.    The response was enthusiastic. &quot;I feel really good about it,&quot; said Rod Gainer, a 19-year Ford veteran who works in the body shop of the company's Wayne, Mich., assembly plant. &quot;I'll do my part for the company because they deserve it. They're giving us these profits.&quot;    At General Motors, meanwhile, workers haven't been as happy. The same day the company announced it would make no profit-sharing payments, it said it would distribute $169 million in bonuses to executives. The company has defended the actions, noting that bonus payments dropped 23% from last year, and that a much larger portion of executive compensation is tied to performance.    &quot;They're two different things,&quot; GM's vice president for labor relations, Alfred Warren, said. &quot;The employee didn't lose anything. We put the profit-sharing plan on top of what the employee had.&quot; He added that &quot;every executive has part of his income at risk, some as much as two-thirds.&quot;    But many workers haven't been convinced. Members of UAW Local 735 at GM's Hydro-Matic transmission plant in Willow Run, Mich. have raised about $6 so far in a mock &quot;Pennies for Roger&quot; fund drive for Roger B. Smith, GM chairman. &quot;I think it's pretty insulting for a corporation to be claiming poverty . . . and then have the audacity to say we have to pay our big shots a bonus,&quot; said Danny Hoffman, an official of the local.    &quot;And when the Ford workers get their checks . . . that really rubs the salt in the wounds of the GM workers,&quot; Mr. Hoffman added. &quot;That's going to create a lot of animosity going into a bargaining year.&quot;    Ford hasn't yet announced its 1986 bonus payments to executives.    The difference between the Ford and GM profit sharing mainly reflects the companies' relative profits for 1986 -- Ford's increased 31% from 1985 while GM earnings dropped 26%. But they also stem from different profit-sharing formulas negotiated by the UAW and the two auto makers in 1982. Ford calculates the payouts by comparing profits to sales, while GM compares profits to assets.    &quot;The result is effectively a higher threshold at GM,&quot; said a former UAW staff member who helped devise the formulas. &quot;GM, because they're more highly integrated than Ford, tends to have more assets per sale.&quot;    While GM made larger profit-sharing payments for 1983, Ford made bigger per-capita payouts for the following two years. For 1984, Ford paid an average of $2,100, while GM paid $550. For 1985, Ford paid an average of $1,200 while GM paid $350.    The different returns have created different attitudes by Ford and GM workers about the concept of profit sharing. &quot;We took a beating on the numbers,&quot; said Earl Henry, president of a UAW local representing a GM plant in Flint, Mich. He advocates scrapping profit sharing and restoring a guaranteed annual raise, which the union had previously given up, because &quot;that way there's no playing with the numbers. With an annual improvement factor, you know what you're going to get. People can depend on it.&quot;    But Ford's average profit-sharing payment for 1986 is three times larger than the guaranteed annual raise would have been, according to the company. And Walter Washington, president of the UAW local at Ford's Wayne plant, said &quot;it would be awfully hard now to go into negotiations and say we won't have profit sharing. Especially after this payment, people are looking forward to getting it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
