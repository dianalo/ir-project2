Senior Defense Department officials expect the Joint Chiefs of Staff soon to establish a military &quot;requirement&quot; for the development of the new cruise missiles, which would be launched from submarines, surface ships or aircraft more than 300 miles from their targets. The action would set in motion a weapons program that could translate into billions of dollars in contracts over the next decade.    General Dynamics Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., the principal contractors for the current cruise missiles, declined to comment on the plans for a new generation.    As currently envisioned, the new weapons would travel much farther than the current generation of cruise missiles and would employ breakthroughs in guidance technology to hit within a yard or so of their targets. Current cruise missiles aren't nearly that accurate. The increased accuracy would mean that the new cruise missiles could carry conventional, rather than nuclear, warheads and still render considerable damage.    Planners say such cruise missiles could be critical in halting an attack by conventional Warsaw Pact forces in Europe, where the agreed-to elimination of intermediate nuclear weapons will leave the West more exposed to larger Soviet conventional forces.    The weapons could be equally useful for strikes in the Third World. In the Persian Gulf, for example, Navy officials say cruise missiles could be programmed to destroy the Silkworm missile bases Iran has used for attacks on shipping lanes. The U.S. has been reluctant to send in pilots to take out the Silkworm bases, partly because Iran's surface-to-air missiles make such attacks too risky.    &quot;Things are really rapidly falling into place,&quot; said a Navy official who previously had complained that the Pentagon brass was dragging its feet on the project.    The long-range cruise missiles have several vigorous proponents on Capitol Hill. Sen. Dan Quayle (R., Ind.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has pushed for funds for cruise missile work, and he recently wrote Joint Chiefs Chairman William Crowe calling for a military requirement order and a special office to manage the project.    Ultimately, analysts predict the U.S. may end up buying more than 10,000 conventional land-attack cruise missiles, up from 2,643 called for in current weapons plans.    Military officials say several technological breakthroughs are driving the program. For one, engine designers are planning &quot;prop-fan&quot; engines that significantly extend the missiles' range by combining propellers with jet engine propulsion.    In addition, the Navy has been working with smaller, more effective microprocessors that help guide cruise missiles to their targets. Navy officials say the guidance systems would be able to interact with the military satellites and could alter a missile's course en route.    One Pentagon goal will be to push down the price of cruise missiles. The current ones cost about $1.2 million apiece; the cost would have to be reduced to about $500,000 for the Pentagon to afford a significantly enlarged cruise-missile force.    A major U.S. build-up of cruise missiles would complicate future arms control talks. In the past, negotiations have focused on nuclear weapons, but since cruise missiles could be armed with conventional or nuclear warheads, the Soviets likely would demand that all cruise missiles be included in any future nuclear arms limitation accord. The recently signed treaty on intermediate nuclear weapons did just that: It would eliminate both nuclear and conventional ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
