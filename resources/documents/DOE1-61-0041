We present the solubility data that we have determinedfor five gases in two paraffin solvents in ten tables. The solubilitydata have been correlated with three cubic equations of state employingvan der Waals quadratic mixing rules. The correlation development isbeing continued. Preparation has been made to measure solubility of mixedH{sub 2}/CO gas in n-paraffin solvents. 8 figs., 14 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
