Bleakley   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/26/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   CCI</CO><IN>BANKS (BNK)MAJOR MONEY CENTER BANKS (BAN)</IN><LP>   In another sign that the boom in leveraged buy-outs hascome and gone, Citibank will soon lay off 100 workers in itsleveraged-lending unit and transfer hundreds of others,according to a senior official at the bank.   The move, expected to take place over the next two weeks,is the first in a series of reductions aimed at slashing $250million to $300 million in annual expenses in the sectorserving corporations in the U.S., Europe and Japan. OtherCitibank business units in the U.S. are expected to announcecutbacks internally over the next six to eight weeks, withother units outside the U.S. announcing similar moves andrestructurings in the first quarter of next year.</LP><TEXT>   Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, has about 450 persons in itsLeveraged Capital division. The majority of those remainingwill be transferred along with their clients to existingunits that promote the full range of the bank's service, saidTodd Slotkin, a Citibank senior corporate finance executive.Citibank has leveraged lending offices in five other U.S.cities besides New York.   &quot;The leveraged buy-out market is down about 50% this yearand the outlook is flat for another year or so,&quot; said Mr.Slotkin, who confirmed rumors about the cutbacks. He addedthat the conflict in the Mideast and further uncertainty overthe economy dashed a rebound in leveraged buy-outs thissummer. &quot;August was almost a non-month&quot; for leveragedbuy-outs, he said.   Citibank's retrenchment in leveraged lending and expectedcutbacks in other areas of corporate finance is in line withstaff reductions in those areas at other major banks and onWall Street. Bankers Trust cut 75 professional employees fromits 750 person professional corporate finance staff in June.And Chemical Bank reduced staffing in those areas as part ofa 1,100 staff rollback in February.   On Wall Street, about 200 investment bankers specializingin leveraged buy-outs have lost their jobs at major firmssince the first of the year, estimates Perrin Long of LipperAnalytical Services.   Ironically, leveraged lending is not one of the areasslated for cutbacks at Chase Manhattan Bank, which announcedFriday plans to reduce staff by 5,000. Chase did not build upas large a full-time leveraged-lending staff as Citibank, andit handles a broader mix of financing alternatives, includinginfusions of equity, said Maria Beechey, head of merchantbanking at Chase. In addition, she said, &quot;There still are asignificant number of middle market leveraged buy-outs thatare keeping us busy.&quot;   The cutbacks are part of a business-by-business scrutinyat Citibank that has been underway for the past two months.It is expected by analysts to reduce the 15,000 person staffof the wholesale banking division for the developed world byat least 1,000 persons.</TEXT></DOC>
