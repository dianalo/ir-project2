Adela Holzer, who falsely referred to herself as DavidRockefeller's secret wife and told victims he approved of the dealsshe was promoting, was charged last year with stealing $4 millionfrom investors for fake oil, mineral and land deals.   Under a plea bargain, Ms. Holzer will be sentenced to 4 to 8years in prison instead of the 5 to 15 years she would have facedhad she been tried and convicted.   Sentencing was set for May 10. She could be eligible for parolein two years and 10 months.   Ms. Holzer, who was convicted 11 years ago of stealing $77,500from investors, entered her plea before Acting Justice Richard D.Carruthers.   Carruthers told her that Monday was her last chance to work outa plea bargain and that any future pleas would have to be to all 10counts in the indictment. Her trial had been sent for May 7.   Ms. Holzer said ``yes'' when asked if she was pleading guilty toone charge: the theft of more than $400,000 from an investor, KevinWirth.   She refused to tell the judge her age, saying she would onlyreveal it to the court clerk in private. She is believed to be inher late 60s.   Ms. Holzer successfully raised money for a number of Broadwayshows.   Detectives said she had used at least two fictitious names andhad referred to herself as Rockefeller's secret wife at socialevents.   She persuaded a number of people to invest by leading them tobelieve that Rockefeller thought she was offering a good deal. Sheplaced a photograph of Rockefeller beside her bed in her East Sideapartment.   Rockefeller, retired chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, saidhe never met Ms. Holzer.  </TEXT></DOC>
