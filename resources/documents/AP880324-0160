The groups stopped short of directly criticizing lawsuits filedTuesday by eight states that accused dozens of insurance companiesof conspiring to curtail insurance coverage. Instead, the groupstold reporters that the suits, filed in federal court in SanFrancisco, served to draw attention from what they believe is themain problem: high damage awards by the courts and frivolous suits.   ``We would love to find a simple solution to this,'' saidDerrick Crandall, president of the American Recreation Coalition.``Unfortunately, having lived with this crisis for the last fouryears, we've concluded there are many factors involved.   ``We don't believe this is an issue of insurance companiescolluding,'' Crandall continued. ``If that were the case, why can'tsome recreation companies find insurance at any cost?''   Edward W. Stimpson, president of the General AviationManufacturers Association, echoed Crandall's contentions.   ``Many of our companies are now self-insured or self-insured forthe first $50 million or $100 million,'' Stimpson said. ``So, ourproblem is not an insurance problem, but what's going on in ourcourthouses and legal system.''   He presented figures showing that the number of fatal accidentsinvolving small planes decreasing in the past decade, while theamount of paid claims rose significantly.   William Kronenberg, president and chief executive officer ofEnvironmental Compliance Services Inc., which manages insuranceprograms for companies involved in storing, cleaning up anddisposing hazardous wastes, agreed that the court system is toblame.   Kronenberg said ``It is clear that many of the insurancecompanies did not have an adequate understanding of the pollutionindustry'' when they originally wrote policies and then sharplyincreased rates or stopped writing insurance when they realizedtheir risks.   Blair Childs, executive director of the American Tort ReformAssociation, which says it represents more than 400 tradeassociations, businesses and professional groups, said his grouphas been pushing for several pieces of legislation at the statelevel, among them one that would give judges more power to imposesanctions on lawyers who bring frivolous lawsuits.</TEXT></DOC>
