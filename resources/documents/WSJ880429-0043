He said the next billion could be added by 1998. The World Population Data Sheet, issued Wednesday by the bureau, said the doubling would occur if the population continues to grow at the current 1.7% rate.    The world's population first reached one billion in the early 1800s.    The second billion was added by about 1930, according to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. The population was three billion in 1964, four billion in 1974, and five billion in 1987.    The 1.7 percent growth rate given by the bureau is slightly higher than the 1.6 percent projected by the United Nations, but in a world of five billion people, that difference represents five million more people a year. China, India, Pakistan and Iran have high growth rates.    &quot;Some of the larger countries haven't followed a nice smooth path to the two-child family that we have been predicting,&quot; said Mr. Haub, noting in particular China and India, where previous reductions in births haven't been maintained.    More-developed nations are growing at 0.6% annually, for an anticipated doubling time of 120 years, the data sheet shows. On the other hand, less-developed nations could double population in just 33 years, at a growth rate of 2.1%.    Increasing fastest are Kenya and the disputed territory of Gaza, currently occupied by Israel, each of which is expected to double its population in 17 years.    At the other end of the scale, five countries aren't growing at all -- Austria, Denmark, Hungary, East Germany and West Germany. Italy's population, at its current rate, wouldn't double for 3,465 years. </TEXT></DOC>
