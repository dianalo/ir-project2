The woman who bought the 13 AK-47 rifles ``did it to get them offthe shelves,'' said City Councilman Nate Holden, whose idea startedthe campaign.   The woman, who was not identified, was reimbursed the $5,191.80she spent, Holden said, adding that he would honor her at a CityCouncil meeting. ``She just wanted to recover her costs,'' Holdensaid. ``Can you believe it?''   The department's official gun count stood at 42, but Holdenestimated ``upwards of 50'' and a radio station that took up thecause put the number at 59.   ``It's just rolling right along,'' Holden said, describing asteady flow of people coming to his office with police receipts toclaim money from a $50,000 political committee fund the mayoralcandidate set aside Tuesday.   Five people who collected We do not want to profiteer or benefit fromtheir tragedy,''said Jeffrey Fox, spokesman for five Van Nuys real estate officeworkers.   Almost all the guns turned in have been AK-47s, said Lt. FredNixon, a Police Department spokesman. The first gun turned inTuesday was an Uzi.   Holden, who will pay the value of the weapon up to $300, saidmost people will get the maximum but does not believe profit willbecome a motive.   ``They have a bad feeling about what happened at Stockton,''Holden said.   Patrick Purdy, a young drifter, used an AK-47 on Jan. 17 to killfive students and wound 29 others and one teacher at ClevelandElementary School in Stockton, a San Joaquin Valley community,before he shot himself to death.   It was possible to make a profit from the campaigns. People alsocould pick up $300 by taking a copy of the police receipt to radiostation KIIS-FM in Hollywood from Thursday morning through Fridaymorning.   The radio station reimbursed the woman who bought the 13 rifles$300 per rifle. Holden then paid her the remainder, or $1,291.80.   The station would verify all the receipts before issuing checksbut was concerned only with getting the weapons off the street andnot whether anyone made any money, said Lynn Anderson-Powell,president and general manager.   ``Our purpose was to decrease the number of guns on the street.... We feel that's that many fewer lives that may be needlesslytaken in violence,'' she said.   The station offered $1,000 to the first person to take advantageof the offer and the result was a three-way tie, and because oneperson gave up two guns, KIIS awarded $4,000, Ms. Anderson-Powellsaid.   Compton gun shop owner Mike Virgilio said he sells the AK-47 for$309.95 but has seen custom versions worth up to $1,500. Last yearthe regular model sold for $250 and a used one could cost just $200,he said.   A semiautomatic Uzi retails for $649, Virgilio said.   The Los Angeles Police Department has supported the campaignagainst the military-style semiautomatic rifles favored by streetgangs and helped publicize procedures for safely bringing theweapons to its stations.   Police are examining all the guns to determine whether any havebeen involved in crimes. All guns not retained as evidence will bedestroyed.</TEXT></DOC>
