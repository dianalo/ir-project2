In the proposed amendment tothe State's plan for implementing Title IV-A of the Social Security Act(Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC) the State adopted anew condition permitting the State to shorten the period of ineligibilitycaused by receipt of non-recurring lump sum income.Pursuant to 45 CFR 213.21, I have designated Alexander G. Teitz, a DepartmentalAppeals Board Member, to preside at the hearing, which will be conductedunder the procedures in 45 CFR Part 213. Pursuant to 45 CFR 201.4, a hearinghas been scheduled to be held on Wednesday, January 11, 1989, at 2:00 p.m.,Room 905, 101 Marietta Tower, corner of Marietta and Spring Streets, Atlanta,Georgia 30323. A verbatim transcript will be taken.The provisions of section 402(a)(17) of the Social Security Act and 45CFR 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(F) permit a state to shorten the period of ineligibilityfor receipt of assistance caused by receipt of non-recurring lump sum incomefor a reason beyond the control of the family. The issues to be consideredat the hearing include:1. Whether the State has complete and unfettered discretion to define whatcircumstances it will consider in its State plan as beyond the controlof the family.2. If the State does not have complete discretion to define what is a reasonbeyond the control of the family, must the circumstances be limited tothose needs created by dire or natural disaster, loss or theft of income,or life threatening circumstances?3. If the State is not limited to the reasons given in 2. above, must itsdiscretion in defining what are reasons beyond the control of the familybe reasonable?4. If the State's discretion must be reasonable, and this discretion issubject to review by FSA, did FSA properly find that the State's definitionof reasons beyond the control of the family to include using the lump sumto meet essential needs was not reasonable?A copy of this letter will appear as a Notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and any person wishing to request recognitionas a party will be entitled to file a petition pursuant to 45 CFR 213.15(b)with the Departmental Appeals Board within 15 days after that notice hasbeen published.
