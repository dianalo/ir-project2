(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Braniff Inc. and the Irish aviation companyGPA Group PLC announced an agreement Thursday for the return to GPAof five jetliners leased earlier this year to the Orlando-basedairline.   The announcement came 10 days after GPA filed lawsuits againstthe carrier in Orlando and in Kansas City, Mo., seeking the returnof five Airbus Industrie A320 planes. GPA had accused the airlineof failing to pay $3 million owed for the jets by a Nov. 27deadline.   ``We are returning the A320's as a show of good faith that wewish to work together with GPA as we continue to reorganize ourfinances under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code,''Braniff spokeswoman Ann Cook said in a statement.   GPA's lawsuits against Braniff, Cook said, ``will be dismissed,and GPA will also drop its claim for attorneys' fees and costclaims'' over the lawsuits.   In December 1988, GPA agreed to lease Braniff a total of 26 ofthe 150-seat Airbus A320's. Under terms of that agreement, Braniffalso purchased 24 more of the aircraft from Airbus Industrie, aEuropean consortium.   The airline also holds options to buy an additional 50 of thejetliners.   ``Braniff is actively attempting to market these rights tomaximize the value of the A320's,'' said Cook, who also saidThursday's accord over the return to GPA of the five planes did notaffect the two companies' rights over the other 21 airliners.   On Sept. 28, Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionand sharply reduced its scheduled passenger service. The airlinesuspended all scheduled service Nov. 6 but remains a chartercarrier.   Braniff also announced Thursday a net loss for the quarter endedOct. 31 of $134.9 million, compared with a loss of $7.8 million forthe same quarter in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
