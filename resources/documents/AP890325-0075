So far the prosecution's witnesses have included:   _Nicaraguan Contra leader Adolfo Calero, who tells the juryNorth can't possibly have stolen $4,300 in travelers' checks anddescribes the fired White House aide as ``sort of a savior'' to theguerrillas.   _Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane, whorepeatedly states during five days of testimony that he's to blamefor crimes North is accused of committing.   _Beer magnate Joseph Coors. In front of the jury, Coors walksover to North and warmly shakes his hand.   What will the jurors remember? The handshake or that Coorsacknowledged under questioning that North had given him the numberof a Swiss bank account to contribute money to the Contras?   Then there's the tear-laden testimony of North's formersecretary Fawn Hall, who praised North as a tireless patriot andthen began crying uncontrollably.   She bristled at being a prosecution witness. She said insteadthat she was ``a witness for the truth.''   In order to make some of the witnesses stick to the truth,prosecutors were forced to confront them with earlier testimonythey had given.   Ex-CIA operative Glenn Robinette repeatedly denied that anattempted cover-up was designed to protect North. Prosecutor JohnKeker confronted Robinette with his grand jury testimony from twoyears ago. Robinette said then that the cover-up was an attempt tohelp North, who had accepted a $13,800 home security system free ofcharge.   Facing up to his earlier remarks, Robinette reluctantly agreedthat yes, he had been trying to protect North, as well asIran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord, who had paid for North'ssecurity system.   McFarlane's testimony gave the prosecution fits. Even the judgein the case described it as equivocal and confusing.   Under questioning by North lawyer Brendan Sullivan, McFarlanesaid North prepared just two innocuous paragraphs of a Sept. 5,1985, letter to Congress. Other portions of the letter denied theNational Security Council staff was involved in fund-raising forthe Contras or offering them tactical advice.   McFarlane also testified about a key draft of a Sept. 12, 1985,letter to Congress containing similar denials. McFarlane firsttestified he thought North prepared it, then said he wasn't sure.   There has been strong testimony for the prosecution from formerHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Lee Hamilton and intelligencecommittee staff director Thomas Latimer.   They testified of North's alleged statements at an Aug. 6, 1986,meeting with the intelligence committee denying he had recentlyseen a retired Army general who helped the Contras or that he hadmuch to do with Robert Owen.   North actually met constantly with Owen, who served as hiscourier to the Contras, and had several contacts with retired ArmyGen. John Singlaub in 1986.   The problem with the charge, from the prosecution's point ofview: there's no transcript of the meeting, just sketchy notestaken by Latimer. The intelligence committee was able to arrangethe session only on condition that no transcript be kept.   As the prosecution's case draws to a close this week, the Northtrial will focus on then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III's weekendinquiry in November 1986 which uncovered the diversion of funds tothe Contras.   No transcript was kept of that inquiry either. The prosecutionwill rely on notes taken by Meese aides Chuck Cooper and JohnRichardson and call on all three men to recount events thathappened 2{ years ago.   Their testimony relates to charges that North lied to Meese bydenying the National Security Council was involved in the diversionand by asserting that Israel determined how much would go to theContras from the Iran arms sales.</TEXT></DOC>
