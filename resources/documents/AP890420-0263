FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   RJR Nabisco Inc. reported a 62 percent drop infirst-quarter net income Thursday, blaming the decline on the costsof its takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. and the failure ofits smokeless cigarette.   The company reported net income of $103 million, down from $273million in the same quarter a year ago, and earnings per share of44 cents, down from $1.09 in the first quarter of 1988.   Sales in the quarter were up 5 percent, to $4 billion from $3.8billion in 1988.   Without the merger-related costs and a charge for thediscontinued test of its Premier smokeless cigarette, earnings pershare would have been $1.41 and net income would have been up 17percent to $320 million in the first quarter, RJR Nabisco said.   ``If you adjust it, the earnings gains look good,'' said EmanuelGoldman, an industry analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. in SanFrancisco.   Also Thursday, RJR Nabisco officials refused comment on a WallStreet Journal report that the consumer products company planned tomove its corporate headquarters from Atlanta to New York. TheJournal said the announcement could come at RJR Nabisco's annualmeeting next Thursday.   There had been talk of a move back to North Carolina since theKohlberg Kravis takeover, but analysts noted that Louis GerstnerJr., RJR's new chairman and chief executive officer, is a NewYorker.   Gerstner, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., was president ofAmerican Express Co. before his move to RJR Nabisco.   ``Have you ever noticed how often a corporate headquarters endsup not too far from the chief executive officer's abode?'' Goldmansaid. ``It's not unheard of. It would not be a surprise. It wouldbe a surprise if it stayed in Atlanta.''   RJR Nabisco moved its headquarters to Atlanta two years ago fromWinston-Salem, N.C., its home for more than a century.   New York-based Kohlberg Kravis succeeded in its $25 billiontakeover of RJR Nabisco in February, and RJR said its first-quarterresults were reduced by $247 million because of ``change ofcontrol'' costs associated with the merger.   The industry ``norm'' for such costs no longer applies, said BobYoung, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. ``LBO(leveraged buyout) mergers have very high fees.''   In a leveraged buyout, debt incurred to finance the acquisitionis repaid with the target company's cash flow or sale of its assets.   Other merger-related costs will be reflected in earnings oncethe merger is complete, the earnings statement said. Astockholders' meeting to formally approve the merger is scheduledfor April 27.   Test marketing of the smokeless Premier cigarette wasdiscontinued in February. RJR Nabisco said the failure resulted ina $55 million charge against earnings in the first quarter.   The company's R.J. Reynolds Tobacco subsidiary has said 700employees will be offered early retirement or cash incentives toleave their jobs as a result.   Still, Gerstner said he saw a solid performance in the quarterthat ``demonstrates the basic strength of our tobacco and foodbusinesses and provides a foundation for continued progress.''</TEXT></DOC>
