Clive Derby-Lewis of the Conservative Party urged a ban on salesof platinum and other key minerals that the United States obtainsprimarily from South Africa.   ``Why should South Africa kowtow to the U.S.?'' he said in astatement. The United States ``is deliberately undermining theeconomy of South Africa at great cost to all of its inhabitants.''   ``The United States is cynically oblivious to the doublestandards inherent in their policy of normal trade with theCommunist Bloc countries, who have no record whatsoever of humanrights beliefs,'' Derby-Lewis said.   The U.S. Congress is weighing a sanctions package that would cutmost bilateral economic ties in a bid to pressure South Africa intospeeding up race reform. In 1986, Congress placed limited sanctionson South Africa.   South Africa supplies about 80 percent of the platinum sold tothe non-communist world. It has the world's largest known reservesof strategic minerals such as manganese, chromium, vanadium andtitanium.   The world's other main supplier of strategic minerals is theSoviet Union.   Foreign Minister Rolef ``Pik'' Botha reiterated last week thegovernment has no intention of withholding strategic minerals toWestern nations, even if they impose sanctions.   By law and custom, South Africa's apartheid policies haveestablished a racially segregated society in which the 26 millionblacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whitescontrol the economy and maintain separate districts, schools andhealth services.</TEXT></DOC>
