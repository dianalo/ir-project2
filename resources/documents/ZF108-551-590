HypertextandM;The only honest way to start a column about the suitability of this productfor hypertext is by quoting its creator:andM;&quot;I don't think of HyperCard at all as a hypertext system.andP;  It is not a verygood one.&quot;andM;That would also be the end of the column if every father knew his own child.andO;But out there on the nets over the past three years, HyperCard has been doingthings Bill never envisioned, and is playing an important role in thedevelopment of hypertext systems.andP;  The role is a research role.andM;Field ResearchandM;Since Apple caved in to Atkinson's ultimatum, agreed that HyperCard wassystem software, and began bundling it with every new Macintosh back in 1987,HyperCard authors of varying levels of skill have been all over the nets,showing their work with the obnoxious eagerness of a teacher's pet in gradeschool.andP;  I predicted in DDJ back then that the release of HyperCard wouldlead to a hyperglut of trashware, a pretty obvious prediction.andM;Not all this hyperactivity is trashware; and even in the trash there are someinteresting items.andP;  (Jean-Louis Gassee says that this latter point is notlost on trash can grubbing &quot;MacLeak&quot; reporters, but he's just grumpy becausehe had to give back the company car.)andP;  (Many Americans discovered the joy ofsearching through trash cans in the 1980s, for which Apple must share thecredit with Ronald Reagan.)andP;  (The parenthetical note is one technique thatwriters use to overcome the limitations of linear text.andP;  It's a kludge.)andO;Interesting items, I was saying, thinking particularly of what can be learnedfrom that &quot;interesting experiment&quot; that didn't quite work out.andP;  A lot ofHyperCard development fits this description.andM;I want to call this undisciplined, uncontrolled, enthusiastic amateurHyperCard development work &quot;research,&quot; but this is bending the word.andP;  Thenagain, magazines sometimes use the word &quot;research&quot; to refer to casualreader-interest surveys, which is just as bad.andP;  These two uses are, and yousaw this word here first, &quot;isotropes&quot;--they're similarly bent.andM;Moving right along.andP;  There is a lot of serious, professional, controlledexperimentation in hypertext going on in universities and in the fewcorporate research labs that haven't turned into short-range productdevelopment shops.andP;  In particular, the people at Brown University's IRIS(Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship) have been followingone thread of hypertext research ever since Ted Nelson coined the term, andhave demonstrated the virtues of hypertext for promoting non-linear thinking.andO;This kind of result does not come from playing with HyperCard and uploadingyour work to CompuServe.andM;But in a looser sense, these HyperCard experiments, failed and flawed as theymay be, are crude offerings of aspects of hypertext.andP;  Seeing what has beentried, and how it has been received out there among the savages, is aneducation in hypertext field research.andM;&quot;Crude offerings,&quot; I say, but I do not mean it as a criticism of thedevelopers.andP;  HyperCard is, as Atkinson acknowledges, not a hypertext system.andO;What is it, and why are people using it to do hypertext-like things?andO;Atkinson calls it a &quot;software erector set.&quot;andP;  That's pretty accurate, down tothe point made by one critic that when you build things with an erector set,you get things that look like they were built with an erector set.andP;  HyperCardprovides a limited set of classes of objects: Stacks (which are HyperCarddocuments), cards (information chunks displayed as screen-sized bitmap),fields for text (which can exceed the screen size by scrolling), and buttons(basically icons with attached programs).andP;  In limited object-oriented style,HyperCard lets you create stacks by writing message handlers and associatingthem with instances of these classes of objects.andP;  The basic metaphor is of astack of 3 X 5 cards, each card displaying text and/or graphics, and thecards linked to one another quite freely, with buttons being the usual toolfor following the links.andM;This model supplies several things that a hypertext system ought to have.andO;The user can create links among chunks of information without doing anyprogramming and the programmer can create different links relatively easily.andO;HyperTalk, the programming language in HyperCard, is interpreted, so it's aquick development tool, yet it's powerful for an interpreted language.andP;  Applegives HyperCard away with every new machine, so you can count on Mac usershaving it, and this also has led to a lot of people having fiddled with it,so HyperCard is helping to spread familiarity with some hypertext ideas.andM;It also lacks some things a hypertext system needs.andP;  It has no built-innavigation system, although Apple encourages stack developers to include mapsin their stacks.andP;  There is nothing analogous to a browser.andP;  HyperCard's linksare coarse-grain links, taking the reader from card to card.andP;  Fine-grainlinking, triggering off items the size of an individual word, is possible,but is not inherent in the product.andP;  HyperCard has no text links.andM;In Search of the Missing LinkandM;The biggest failing of HyperCard for anyone interested in hypertext is thelack of text links.andP;  By the time this column sees print -- I'm writing thisin January, believe it or not -- Apple should have released Version 2.0 ofHyperCard, widely expected to implement some kind of text links.andP;  I thinkit's fairly safe to predict that Apple's text links will not satisfy allthose people who want HyperCard to be a better hypertext tool.andM;The text link solution supported in Version 2 is likely to be an extension ofthe button model.andP;  As I write this, buttons are the chief tool in HyperCardfor supporting links.andP;  A button is restricted to one line (usually a word ortwo) of text.andP;  Fields are where you put text in HyperCard.andP;  Fields were neverdesigned to support linking.andM;HyperTalk programmers have been coding workarounds for this failing sinceHyperCard was released, though, and some of these are effective in limiteddomains.andP;  The work these programmers are doing with text links typifies thekind of work being done with HyperCard in other hypertext or hypermediaareas, and it shows how easy it is to test alternative hypertalk userinterface techniques using HyperCard.andM;What Atkinson gave us is the button.andP;  To create a link to another section(card) of a HyperCard document (stack) or to another stack, you create abutton and link it to the card or stack.andP;  The link is by defaultunidirectional, except that the user can always return from a linked card viaa standard key combination or menu selection.andP;  If you want explicitbidirectional links, you have to create and link two buttons.andP;  (Buttons canalso be used to trigger pop-up fields, for such fine-grained hypertextpurposes as displaying, in a pop-up window or field, a definition of a term.)andM;The first thing many people did when they started working with HyperCard wasto place an invisible button over a text field or a graphic to make somethinghappen when the text or graphic was clicked on.andP;  The earliest stacks fromApple used this technique.andP;  One early third-party developer who made good useof such invisible buttons is Amanda Goodenough, whose AmandaStories stacksshowed one way to author interactive, child-directed stories for youngreaders.andP;  But the buttons were constrained to be rectangles and were notreally connected with the text or art with which they were associated.andO;Change the text, copy the art and paste it elsewhere, move the button, andthe button is no longer associated with the text or graphic.andM;Soon after HyperCard's release, Keith Rollin of Apple demonstrated how towrite a HyperCard external command to implement region buttons.andP;  Thesebuttons, which used QuickDraw regions, could take on arbitrary polygonalshapes.andP;  This development, along with the fixed bitmap of a card (which makesscreen position a somewhat reasonable way to refer to a picture), appears tomake transparent buttons fairly useful for linking off pictures.andP;  Good stackscontinue to be developed using this technique.andP;  But it doesn't do the job fortext: You can't even change the font in a field without having to repositionthe button.andP;  For hypertext linking, you need to be able to link off text, notoff a screen position.andM;One step toward better linking might be to extend the find facility ofHyperCard.andP;  Users can already select text in a field and perform a findoperation.andP;  Why not insert a step between selection of the text and theconventional search?andP;  If the text selected is on a list of hypertext linkwords, follow the link; otherwise, let the find proceed as usual.andP;  HarveyChang and Steve Drazga are two stack developers who extended the findfunction.andP;  Listing One (page 153) shows Drazga's hypertext technique whileChang's is in Listing Two (page 153).andP;  Chang's technique starts by allowingthe user to select any contiguous text, even dragging across word boundaries.andO;Then it attempts to use the selected text as the name of a card in a &quot;go tocard ...&quot; command.andP;  If that fails, it uses the selected text as aconventional search string.andP;  His implementation suffers from the requirementthat the user select text, then explicitly click on a hypertext button.andM;There are a couple of problems with this technique as an approach tohypertext.andP;  (Chang, I should point out, doesn't call it that.)andP;  First, itdoesn't give the reader any indication of where the links are.andP;  Second, itraises the question of what unit of text can serve as links.andM;Which Text is Hyper?andM;Chang's technique doesn't identify the links, so the reader must hit them bychance.andP;  In other hypertext systems, the linking text is often identified bya change in type style: Boldface, italic, underlining, or all of these, maybe used.andP;  HyperCard doesn't make such an approach easy.andP;  Text fields inHyperCard are impoverished text of a single font, size, and style.andP;  One stackdeveloper, Gregory Nelson, investigated what it would take to create even theappearance of rich text in HyperCard fields.andP;  He faked rich text by using 10(!) overlapping fields and a thoroughly unworkable text-entry procedure.andO;That blind alley is thoroughly mapped, thanks to Nelson.andM;John Anderson had better luck in introducing style variations in HyperCardfields, by creating a specialized font that included italic and romancharacters.andP;  Because it means losing the special characters that had been inthe font, this approach trades text impoverishment for font impoverishment,and is still a long way from support for the kind of hypertext linkidentification seen in products such as Guide.andM;HyperWords and HyperLinesandM;The other problem with Chang's technique, viewed as an approach to hypertextlinking, is that it depends on the select operation, which is nicelystandardized across the Macintosh-user interface, but which is not atechnique designed for grabbing links.andP;  This is particularly so in HyperCard,where the user can't select text unless the field is unlocked -- in whichcase the text is subject to modification.andP;  You certainly don't want the userselecting a hypertext link only to delete it from the document by a carelesstouch of the delete key.andM;Many stackware developers have found the same fix for this problem.andP;  To allowthe user to select a word in any field simply by clicking on it once asthough it had a button attached, you do the following:andM;%lock the fieldandM;%wait for a click in the fieldandM;%save the coordinatesandM;%unlock the field invisiblyandM;%send two clicks to the coordinatesandM;%save the selectionandM;%relock the fieldandM;The first significant implementation of the single-word link I know of isXrefText by Frank Patrick (available as shareware from BMUG or BCS).andP;  RainesCohen of Team BMUG inspired this shareware quasi-hypertext system, which letsusers create links from arbitrary single words in fields by option-clicking,and lets them follow these links by simply clicking.andP;  XrefText limits itssearch for the selected word to a keyword field on every card.andP;  The linkwords are identified by an asterisk.andM;This works well for selecting a single word, and I've found it a useful wayto allow the user to select an item from a scrolling list, even when theitems in the list are not single words.andP;  My technique, which handles moved orscrolled fields, is shown in Listing Three, page 153.andM;This technique is all right for picking a line from a field, but neither thisnor the toggle-lock-and-simulate-double-click technique for picking a singleword is something you want to be doing regularly in an interpreted language.andM;One serious problem with all these approaches is that not every key can be asingle word or a complete line.andP;  Footnotes in linear text sometimes apply toa single word, but can also apply to a sentence, paragraph, chapter, propername, or to the general idea of a passage.andP;  Hypertext links ought to be justas flexible.andM;From SuperScript to Tagsterisk, orandM;Footnotes of the FutureandM;John Anderson, when he was developing stacks under the Acme Dot logo, came upwith something he called the &quot;tagsterisk,&quot; a tool for identifying for thereader not only where links are in the text, but also what they are.andP;  &quot;Theidea,&quot; he said, &quot;is to give the reader a clue indicating just where he or shewill branch if he or she clicks on a tagged word.&quot;andP;  Tagsterisks are justalphabetic superscript characters to be used in the way that asterisks areused in linear text to point to footnotes.andP;  Anderson implemented them as partof his custom font.andM;Tagsterisks, he claimed, &quot;give the reader a greater feeling of control overthe hypertext process.andP;  The key is to use no more than three or four.&quot;andP;  OneAnderson stack used four tagsterisks: s to flag a source reference, m formore information on the subject, g for a graphic, and p for pronunciation(the last two being hypermedia rather than hypertext).andP;  Another stack used pfor a picture, g for a graph, d for a definition, and l to bring up a list oflinks to other documents on the subject.andP;  Only the last of these was actuallyimplemented as a link to another card or stack; the other three tagsteriskstriggered pop-up windows or fields.andM;Tagsterisks are not tied to any particular method of implementing the link,which could be done with a button over the text, a field script, or withwhatever technique is included in Version 2 of HyperCard.andP;  It's worth notingthat, if the linking script is associated with the tagsterisk characteritself, it becomes possible to attach two or more links to one word, say, apicture and a definition, without ambiguity.andM;Hypertext has been called the extended footnote, but only as a reference toits closest analog in linear text, not as a design direction.andP;  Tagsteriskstake the expression literally, extending the footnote in several dimensions.andO;There are some advantages to this extended footnote approach over, say,boldfacing links in text.andP;  One could argue, for example, that hypertext oughtto extend the concept of text, not limit it.andP;  Using boldface to representlinks &quot;uses up&quot; this font style variation, precluding its use for otherpurposes.andP;  The proponent of boldface links could counter that every use ofboldface in linear text is really a wannabe link.andP;  Maybe our typographicconventions and type style variations were developed precisely to circumventthe limitations of the linear medium.andP;  If so, boldface has been waiting allthis time to be used for hypertext link identification.andP;  The response mightbe that it's a little naive to think that we haven't found other,nonhypertextual uses for these typographical conventions over the centuries.andM;It's not clear that either side of this argument is wrong.andP;  No doubtdifferent techniques are appropriate for different purposes.andP;  Designers oftraining manuals, help systems, and the like seem to be doing all right withboldface and italic variations to identify links.andP;  Universal hypertext mayrequire something else, but universal hypertext is something else.andM;Whether or not one buys the argument that hypertext should extend text andnot limit it, it seems clear that HyperCard should stop limiting its users'use of text.andP;  The impoverished text fields of HyperCard have not helpedresearch in this area, either to investigate ways to use text stylevariations to identify links, or to show that this is a bad idea.andP;  HyperCardneeds richer text fields.andM;Hypertext, though, is still very much in the research stage, and HyperCardstack development is one legitimate form of hypertext research.andP;  Thelaboratory studies, valuable as they may be, are not going to tell us muchabout the market acceptance of particular user-interface implementationdecisions regarding hypertext.andP;  I recommend that anyone interested inhypertext download some stack and take a look at them.andP;  Even better, uploadsome.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
