Lt. Gen. Konstantin F. Mikhailov, first deputy chief of theForeign Ministry's Arms Limitation and Disarmament Administration,told reporters the suggestion was in line with Soviet policy onother issues.   ``A similar proposal was proposed (by us) for monitoring heavybombers hardware, and if you have in mind the experiment formonitoring strategic nuclear weapons, we are prepared to discussthis question,'' Mikhailov told a regular Foreign Ministry newsbriefing.   Mikhailov commented in response to a question about DeputyForeign Minister Viktor P. Karpov's remarks in a Washington Postinterview that Moscow could accept U.S. proposals for trialinspections of nuclear weapons systems as long as more weapons arecovered.   Karpov, who was a chief negotiator at Geneva arms control talks,also was quoted as saying the Soviets would consider limits onmulti-warhead mobile missiles.   Karpov, in a Moscow interview reported in today's editions of theWashington newspaper, said such inspections ``should not prevent thenormal development of negotiations in Geneva or be a preconditionfor work on the draft text and protocols. They should go hand inhand.''   But Karpov said the Soviets want to include more weapons systemsthan were envisioned in the U.S. proposal put forward in theStrategic Arms Reduction Talks in Geneva last month for monitoringexperiments while the negotiations are under way.   U.S. officials reportedly have wanted to confine the experimentsto silo-based missiles and mobile strategic missiles. Karpov,however, was quoted as saying cruise missiles and bomber basesshould be included.   The first monitoring should be of sea-launched cruise missiles,``one of the areas where the most difficult verification problemsarise,'' he said. He also suggested inspectors might visit eachother's cruise missile factories.   Although the United States proposed continuous monitoring ofentrances and exits of plants producing mobile strategic missiles,it has no such plants of its own.   However, the Bush administration has proposed putting the10-warhead MX missile on rail cars and the proposed single-warheadMidgetman on mobile land transporters.   Karpov said, ``If we can have inspectors at production plants forthe MX or the Midgetman, then we would be ready to have such a teamat our plant'' producing the multi-warhead SS-24, a mobile missile.   Asked if the Soviets would consider banning or sharply limitingsuch missiles, Karpov said, ``I think that can be considered.''   He said the Soviet Union might also accept a ban on nuclearcruise missiles of any range, instead of numerical limits on thelong-range strategic variety it has put forward, ``if we can findefficient means to carry out the elimination of tactical nuclearweapons in a way that won't harm U.S. and Soviet securityinterests.''</TEXT></DOC>
