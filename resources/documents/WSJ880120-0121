Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp., Japan Highway Corp. and ICI Finance BV all launched 10-year or 11-year issues this month, and all yield about the same at their market prices.    But NTT, which launched its issue through Switzerland's traditional underwriting syndicate that includes all three of the big Swiss banks, paid 23 basis points more to finance its 200 million Swiss francs ($146 million) of bonds than ICI paid for its 250 million francs. This was despite the fact that NTT's senior debt outstanding is rated higher than Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, the parent of ICI Finance.    But ICI and Japan Highway sought bids for their deals, and came out with lower borrowing costs. ICI's borrowing cost, for example, is 4.95% for its 11-year issue; NTT will pay 5.18% for its 10-year paper.    Since both are trading at about the same level, the difference is accounted for by lower underwriting fees on the ICI deal.    This points up the fact that as Swiss bond markets loosen their rules, they are moving closer to the practice of the deregulated Eurobond market, in which tough competition results in discounted underwriting commissions on new bond issues.    &quot;There is no question now that banks are discounting pricing,&quot; said one Zurich banker. &quot;It's a feature of competitive bidding.&quot;    The extra money NTT is paying &quot;goes into the pockets of the banks underwriting that issue,&quot; said a Geneva syndication manager.    After the competitive bidding process, ICI awarded its mandate to Swiss Bank Corp., which undercut its two competitors, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse, by more than one percentage point.    In response, both UBS and Credit Suisse, along with five other banks, declined to participate in the deal, saying it was too tightly priced.    Like Swiss Bank, Banque Paribas (Suisse) won the mandate for Japan Highway after a competitive bidding process that included Switzerland's three largest banks.    The banks underwriting ICI and Japan Highway make less money on commissions, but may be able to pick up extra income through commissions they receive when trading the bonds. </TEXT></DOC>
