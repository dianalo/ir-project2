The refugees fled the Khmer Rouge camp of Kaiche after it washeavily shelled in mid-April and traveled a few miles to Sok Sanncamp, run by the non-communist Khmer People's National LiberationFront, or KPNLF.   The Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group fighting Vietnameseforces in Cambodia, wanted the refugees returned to Kaiche. But theU.N. Border Relief Operation and the International Committee of theRed Cross, which have reported widespread human rights violations inKhmer Rouge camps, insisted the refugees be allowed to choose whereto live.   The Thai official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thatas a ``compromise,'' the military decided the refugees should bemoved to Site 8, the only Khmer Rouge camp where the guerrillas haveallowed aid officials to give refugees full medical and otherservices. Site 8 is north of Kaiche, which is along the Cambodianborder and in Thailand's eastern Trat province.   He could not say when the transfer would take place.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in Washingtonthat the Thai government confirmed to U.S. officials that therefugees will be allowed to remain in non-communist resistancecamps. She said this followed strong appeals from U.S. officials toThailand that the refugees not be returned to Khmer Rouge controlbecause their safety could not be assured.   ``The United States goverment continues to be strongly opposed tothe return of these Cambodians to Khmer Rouge control,'' she said.   A Western relief official, also speaking anonymously, called theThai decision a ``face-saving'' move in which the military wouldavoid criticism for returning the refugees to Kaiche yet stillcontinue support for the Khmer Rouge.   ``The refugees should have individual choice,'' he said. ``Somepeople have families in Sok Sann and they should stay in Sok Sann.Some have families in Site 8 and they should go to Site 8. Somepeople have reasons to flee Khmer Rouge control and they should notbe sent to Khmer Rouge control.''   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnamese forcesinvaded and ousted it from power in late 1978. Washington says 2million people, a fourth of the population, were executed or died offamine in the Khmer Rouge's attempt to impose radical agrariancommunism.   The Khmer Rouge fled to the border, established camps just insideThailand and allied itself with guerrillas of the KPNLF and ofPrince Norodom Sihanouk. Violations reported in Khmer Rouge refugeecamps included forcing children to porter arms through mine fieldsand denying people emergency medical treatment.   Western aid officials have been barred from Kaiche. The flightfrom Kaiche was one of the largest escapes from a Khmer Rouge campin years, one relief official said.   The refugees fled after gunners inside Cambodia rained heavyshells on Kaiche and nearby Ta Luan camp. Relief officials believehundreds of people were hurt, but the Khmer Rouge refused to allowany to be evacuated to outside hospitals.</TEXT></DOC>
