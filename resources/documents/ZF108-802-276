Lots, to hear some is managerstell it who have allowed PCs to take over some of the more routine tasks athand.andP;  And there's more work in the future for the baby brother of thebehemoth mainframes.andM;Most of these back-room PCs are being used as front ends for the data centerconsole, the control center that monitors data center operations.andP;  just a fewyears back, there were only a few PC products available for this task, butnow most vendors of data center automation tools offer some PC product-orsoon will.andM;Several trends are contributing to the current growth in popularity of thesePC tools: data center consolidation, the move to decrease information systemscosts, the multivendor environment existing in most companies, as well as theproliferation of PCs and workstations themselves.andP;  Says Mark M. Levin, aprincipal consultant at the Advanced Technology Group of New York City-basedKPMG Peat Marwick andamp; Co.: &quot;Most data centers have to reduce costs and increaseservice levels, and that's motivating people to use these PC consoleautomation products.&quot;andM;The Mouse That RoaredandM;It may seem ironic that the PC has become the tool of choice for controllinggateways into data centers, but according to IS officials currently using PCdata center automation products, the PC makes perfect sense.andP;  &quot;It makes sensefrom several angles, but basically if you're going to automate your datacenter you need to use your people most efficiently.andP;  The PC helps make thatpossible by taking over some basic functions and leaving is workers to domore important work,&quot; says Howard Taylor, assistant vice president in the isdepartment at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., also in New York City.andM;According to Arnold Farber, a principal of Farber/LaChance  Inc.andP;  inRichmond, Va., PC front ends represent one step in the process ofconsolidating data centers into supercenters.andP;  &quot;The current products thatmake up the PC front-end tools really represent the first step in what willbe an eventual evolution toward the data center that will interface with therest of the corporate-computing environment, a broad CPU environment,&quot; Farbersays.andP;  Farber's company conducts training sessions for data center officialsand offers consulting services to companies moving toward automated datacenters.andM;That &quot;broad cpu environment&quot; refers to the mix of mainframes, minicomputers,PCs and workstations that most large is departments are beginning tointegrate into their corporate computer networks.andP;  For Is managers to succeedin this effort, Farber says, the must meet user needs and reduce is costs atthe same time.andP;  To do so, giving routine tasks to inexpensive PCs makes goodeconomic sense.andM;The PC payoff can come quickly, says Richard Halprin, software specialist forBlue Cross andamp; Blue Shield of Connecticut in North Haven.andP;  Halprin installedthe OPS/MVS remote PC system from Goal Systems International Inc. ofColumbus, Ohio, for his MVS console.andP;  The system was put in place just sixmonths ago, and already Halprin is close to recouping his investment.andM;Dialing for RepairsandM;Currently, the system is being used to automate the initial program load(IPL) process and to assist data center personnel with problem escalationcontrol.andP;  Using a board and a modem that can transmit both voice and datainside the PC, the system can automatically dial out and even contact theright person to perform repairs, if necessary.andP;  Halprin says that, as datacenter personnel become more familiar with what the PC can do to automate theconsole, his company will be adding more features.andP;  &quot;We're considering addingremote operation capabilities,&quot; he says.andM;KPMG Peat Marwick is also thinking about adding more powerful PC automationtools over time, says Levin.andP;  &quot;These things are just getting started in thedata center,&quot; he says.andP;  At present, PC front-end automation tools have fourprimary uses, he says.andP;  &quot;One, is as a front-end machine, to consolidateconsoles.andP;  Two, it's becoming more important to control multiple platforms:IBM, DEC, Tandem.andP;  Three, as problems escalate, the mainframe software can'thandle it all, so the PC can tackle some of the problems.andP;  And fourth, the PCcan try to restart a dropped line and call for service if necessary.&quot;andM;As data center consolidation and automation increase, other uses will befound for the PC front-end tools, says Levin.andP;  &quot;Already, you're seeing plentyof new innovations on that score,&quot; he says.andP;  One innovation that's coming isa graphical user interface for PC automation tools.andP;  Pittsburgh-based LegentCorp. hints it will soon release an os/2 version that will put a PresentationManager face on its Auto-Mate/XC product.andM;According to several suppliers of data center software, OS/2's multitaskingcapabilities are ideally suited for the data center, where operators mustoften pay attention to several monitors at once.andP;  os/2-based data centersoftware will theoretically make it possible for operators to moreefficiently solve problems while working in one os/2 session as workcontinues in the background on other sessions.andP;  A spokeswoman  for Legentsays that recent features it  has added to its products have about  exhaustedthe memory capabilites of  MS-DOS.andM;Ahead of the Times?andM;Still, Farber at Farber/LaChance maintains that os/2 and Presentation Managermay be a little leading edge for many companies.andP;  &quot;Many data centers arestill grappling with the changes wrought by automation [in general]; consoleautomation by PCs may not be that big a priority,&quot; he says.andM;Still, some companies are reaping strategic advantages by automating theirconsoles.andP;  At Manufacturers Hanover, the move to a PC front end has madeoperations more efficient.andP;  &quot;We're in the process of maintaining dual sitedata centers-one site in Delaware and one in New York-with one site providingcontingency support for the other.andP;  Currently, we just have one site [that isstaffed], ana we contract out for other support when we have down time,&quot; saysassistant vice president Taylor.andP;  With the PC front end, we're freeing up ourdata center people to make the data center more efficient, and we're alsoable to keep our support cost down as we move toward supporting that seconddata center.andP;  Without that ability, our costs would be higher,&quot; he says.andM;Manufacturers Hanover uses Legent's AutoMate/xc automated operations tool forits data center, which houses IBM 3084 and 3090 mainframes.andP;  Taylor isrelying on the product to handle many of the routine tasks normally done bydata center personnel, such as problem escalation control and performing anIPL of the system.andP;  But, while the PC is now the primary access point intothe mainframe for data center personnel, it has not been given complete runof the console.andM;Before that could happen, Taylor explains, &quot;I'd like some sort of backup forrecoverability, such as having two PCs working in tandem so that when onegoes down, the other takes over automatically.andP;  When you have a PCcontrolling a major IBM mainframe, it becomes an Achilles' heel, and a majorconcern is a single point of failure,&quot; he says.andM;Since many PC front-end tools can monitor both mainframes and other systems,they fit well in multivendor environments.andP;  Gus Garcia, senior systemsanalyst at Sea-Land Service inc. of Elizabeth, N.J., is using Legent'sAutoMate/ xc product to monitor a cluster of Digital VAXs and an IBMmainframe.andP;  &quot;I'm going to be adding a board to the PC that will let memonitor up to eight vaxs at once.andP;  It's just like running another Windowssession,&quot; he says.andM;Sea-Land, a shipping company, is in the process of building a supercenter tohouse its data-processing operations, and the PC product fits into thatscheme.andP;  &quot;We need to show our users how efficient we've become, and with thisproduct we can demonstrate that.andP;  We'll be handling the routine functionsfrom the PC, and [that will] let us concentrate on the more difficultprojects,&quot; Garcia says.andM;Despite what some users are doing with the PC front-end systems, the area ofdata center automation is still in its infancy, maintains data centerconsultant Farber of Farber/LaChance.andP;  &quot;Most firms are still not usingautomation for their data centers in any big way, though I do believe mostare at least discussing it,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Political issues remain a bigstumbling block,' he says, referring to the fear felt by some Is managersthat automation translates into a loss of power and control.andP;  &quot;The technicalissues we can solve.andP;  It's really only in the last two years that consoleautomation has become the norm.&quot;andM;PC Partners for MainframesandM;A number of PC front-end products are currently available for data centerautomation tasks.andP;  Among the leading packages are the following:andM;Altai SoftwareandM;Arlington, TexasandM;Product: Zack/PC, an option to the company'sandM;Zack/MVS and Zack(VSE dataandM;center automation productsandM;Circle No.andP;

 105andM;A Distribution of Power when a PC is wheeled into most data centers toautomate the mainframe console, it rarely replaces the human consoleoperator.andP;  Rather, it more often turns a multiscreen operator into asingle-screen operator, thereby increasing overall productivity.andM;In most nonautomated data centers, console operators have to keep track of atleast two screens: one for initial program loads  (IPLs) and another forgeneral MVS operations.andP;  Larger data centers have even more screens.andP;  With PCfront ends, howevers, operators can sit at just one screen and take advantageof the PC's computing power for monitoring multiple alert functions.andO;Meanwhile, the PC can be programmed to take care of routine functions, suchas the IPLs, which manually take operators up to 45 minutes to perform.andO;Automation cuts this down to 10 minutes.andM;None of this magic is performed solely by the PC.andP;  Rather, most PC front endsact in concert with mainfrime-based data center automation software.andP;  Not toolong ago, all such software was sold only for mainframes, but today mostsuppliers are providing PC products.andP;  According to a spokeswoman for LegentCorp., few of its data center automation products are sold today without PCfront ends-a far  cry from three years ago when the PC add-ons wereintroduced to a still skeptical audience.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
