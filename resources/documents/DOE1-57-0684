The following features of CD responses occurringin the time range of 10 s to 1-3 min were noted: (i) The kinetics andrelative amplitudes of the responses are similar over broad spectralranges surrounding the major CD bands, i.e., between 670 and 760 nm andbetween 480 and 550 nm. This applies not only to randomly oriented samplesbut also to magnetically aligned membranes having markedly differentCD spectra in the dark. (ii) Photosystem I is much more effective thanphotosystem II and can drive a 40-80% decrease in CD signal relativeto the dark control level. (iii) Photosystem I driven changes are fullyinhibited by nigericin or NH{sub 4}Cl but are largely insensitive togramicidin. CD changes driven by photosystem II, on the other hand, aresensitive to all of these reagents. (iv) The CD responses can be shownto originate in circular differential scattering rather than in circulardifferential absorbance. They can also be distinguished from light-induced,nonpolarized scattering changes. The data are qualitatively evaluatedwith respect to the theory of circular differential scattering of largehelically organized macroaggregates, the size of which is commensuratewith the wavelength of the measuring beam. The observed decrease of thelarge CD signal is ascribed to a partial loss of macrohelicity in thelight-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complex, in response to a protongradient and/or surface electrical field generated most effectively byphotosystem I.</TEXT></DOC>
