(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DEC Sets the Pace in WorkstationsandM;Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) has long been one of the major suppliersof mini-computers in the world.andP;  In recent years, as sales of both minis andmainframe computers began to sag, DEC, like so many other companies, has beencasting around for ways to shore up sales and revenue figures.andP;  Over the lastfew years, DEC introduced its own PC, the DEC Rainbow, which met with lessthan fantastic success.andP;  The company made a deal with Apple Computer to worktogether on workstation and PC products as well as communications.andP;  Theysigned an agreement with Compaq, and also made a deal with Tandy.andM;On the high-end, DEC introduced a &quot;super-mini&quot; to compete with IBM'smainframe offering, and also added substantially to the VAX line ofequipment.andP;  These new VAX offerings include several desktop units as well asa strengthening of their true mini-computer product line.andM;In January 1989, DEC announced the DECstation 3100 and in July of the sameyear, the DECstation 2100.andP;  Both of these units are RISC-based (ReducedInstruction Set Computing) systems, designed to compete head-on in thegraphics workstation market against such competitors as SUN, Hwelett-Packard,and IBM.andP;  The industry analysts who follow the workstation market were mildlyimpressed with these offerings but felt that they were &quot;light&quot; in the area ofgraphics (a key feature of workstation products).andM;On April 3rd of this year, DEC announced a new series of workstations whichshould put to rest any negative comments about graphics capabilities.andP;  Thenew workstations are referred to as the DECstation 5000, Model 200 for thesingle processor systems, and the 5830 and 5840 systems for multi-processorunits.andM;The DEC announcements actually included over 20 new computers, peripherals,and software products squarely aimed at extending the distributed computingcapabilities of its RISC-based open systems offerings.andP;  These new productsinclude: A system that is claimed to be the industry's highest performing 3Ddesktop workstation; high-end, RISC-based multiprocessor servers and a newdesktop server; a significant new version of DEC's version of UNIX--ULTRIX,with distributed computers capabilities with SMP and RPC, furtherimplementation of NAS (Network Application Support) services including SQLsupport, improved PC integration, and enhanced mail capabilities.andM;Further announcements included a DAT-technology (Digital Audio Tape) backuptape drive; new disk storage devices; and price reductions on DEC's existingRISC-based workstations, servers, and ULTRIX software (some of these pricereductions are in the 40% category--a very aggressive stance for DEC totake).andM;WorkstationsandM;Perhaps the most exciting of these new DEC products is the DECstation 5000series of workstations.andP;  This is the most powerful DEC workstation and hasbeen designed for compute-intensive 2D and 3D graphics applications.andP;  It isavailable in a number of different configurations starting with the CX--an8MB unit with a 19&quot; gray-scale monitor, a resolution of 1,280 X 1,024 pixels,130,000 2D vectors, 8-plane frame buffer, and 2D accelerator.andP;  The price forthis system is in the $14K range while the 16&quot; and 19&quot; color versions are inthe $16K and $19K range, respectively.andM;Next in the line-up is the PX, which is also an 8MB RAM system (expandable to120MB) featuring 70,000 3D vectors, 300,000 2D vectors, and a 19&quot; colormonitor with full double buffer, and priced at a starting point of around$21K.andP;  The XPG follows with 16MB of RAM, 3D accelerator, 8 and 24 planes,65,000 3D polygons, 300,000 3D vectors, and sporting an Intel i860accelerator.andP;  The price for the 8 plane unit starts at $29K and the 24 planeversion is around $36K (both with 19&quot; color monitors).andM;On the high-end of this group of workstations is the PXG Turbo with 16MB ofRAM, 102,000 3D polygons, 400,000 3D vectors, 19&quot; color monitor with 24planes, 24 bit Z-buffer, and full double buffer.andP;  This work horse startingprice is in the $50K+ class.andM;The entry level systems (CX) are available now with the rest to follow byearly summer.andP;  The DECstation 5000 family also includes a line of Model 200table-top servers, permitting network operation of the workstations.andP;  Theserver model starts out with 8MB of RAM (expandable to 120MB) and can handleup to 28GB of storage.andP;  One of the new features of this server product is aTURBOchannel I/O interconnect adding to both the system performance and theconfiguration flexibility.andM;The DECstation 5000 model 200 uses the MIPS R3000 CPU and delivers 24 MIPS(compared to 27.5 MIPS claimed by IBM in the new system/6000 family ofworkstations (using Dhrystone Version 1.1), and is up to 20 times faster thana VAX-11/780.andP;  Memory can be expanded from 8MB up to 120MB in 8MB increments.andO;The memory is full ECC (error-correcting) and separate data and instructioncaches help to optimize the system's performance.andM;GraphicsandM;All of the four graphics modes available are handled through the TURBOchannelbus.andP;  Thus, a system can be upgraded by interchanging video sub-systems andthe server systems do not require graphics controllers.andP;  The four graphicsoptions are: Model 200 CX which is a color frame buffer unit, the PX which isan accelerated 2D system, the Model 200 PXG and PXG turbo which areaccelerated 3D units.andM;Target MarketsandM;DEC is targeting the markets one would expect for workstations: CAD/CAM,molecular modeling, visual simulation, laboratory data acquisitions, medicalimaging, financial and quantitative analysis, technical publications, andCASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering).andM;With these systems, as with all others, it is the software applications whichwill drive sales.andP;  DEC has developed the DECstation 5000 units to supportindustry-standard software and network protocols such as X-Windows, PHIGS,GKS, XUI Toolkit, OSF/Motif, Network File System (NSF), and TCP/IP.andP;  Mixed,multivendor hardware and operating system environments are compatible withthe 5000 and since the systems run ULTRIX, most VAX/ULTRIX applications portto RISC/ULTRIX simply by recompiling.andP;  At the time of the announcement, DECprovided a list of applications which will run on the DECstation 5000systems.andP;  The list reads like a &quot;who's who&quot; in the Unix world and includesapplications in almost every discipline imaginable.andM;Workstation ConclusionsandM;DEC furnished an impressive set of comparisons along with the press kit.andP;  Itis obvious from these that DEC did their homework and does not intend to takea back seat to anyone in the workstation market.andP;  The 14 tests presented byDEC in this comparison are broken down into five groups: Lines, filledpolygons, filled rectangles, text generation, and image operations.andP;  Thecharts provided took the geometric mean of all tests normalized to theDECstation 3100.andP;  Comparisons were run for the DECstation 2100, DECstation3100, DECstation 5000 Model 200CX, 200PX, the Sun SPARCstation 1, theSPARCstation 1 with GX (accelerator) option, and the IBM POWERstation 320.andM;As one would expect, the DECstation 5000 entries outperformed all of theother systems.andP;  In the overall performance rating (see Figure 1), the SunSPARCstation 1 with GX option was rated at 1.1 times that of the DECstation3100 while the DECstation 5000 models were rated at 1.8 and 3.3,respectively.andP;  The 5000 Model 200PX was the top performer in each of thecategories by a wide margin, and in only one test (the window clearMPixels/Second) did the SPARCstation 1 with GX option finish ahead of theModel 200 PX and CX.andM;DEC appears to have some real contenders here.andP;  It remains to be seen if theywill be able to make inroads in this volatile and crowded marketplace.andP;  SUNplans to remain in the lead but both HP and IBM are fast on DEC's heels.andP;  Thecombination of HP and Apollo makes them the strongest contender for the SUNlead but not enough time has passed since the integration of the Apolloproducts into the HP line to determine if the combined market share will holdup under the strong showings of both IBM and DEC.andM;However, DEC will have to be very aggressive with marketing forces in orderto erode the market share of either of the two leaders.andP;  DEC appears to havethe right products, at the right time.andP;  Now what remains to be seen is if theworkstation buyers will opt for these new offerings instead of staying withthe leaders.andP;  Both DEC and IBM are making major pushes in the workstationmarket and both appear to be counting on the fact that an existing strongholdwithin MIS departments will swing some of the business their way.andO;Workstations have always been a kind of &quot;orphan&quot; computer product, one whosepurchase is primarily controlled by engineers and users rather than by MISdepartments.andP;  For DEC to be truly successful in this market they will have toconvince the MIS folks to take a more active role in the selection ofworkstations within the corporate environment.andM;Just having the fastest, most advanced workstations available today does notinsure instant success.andP;  DEC will have to work for every dollar of thismarket that it gets.andP;  Like IBM, DEC is a &quot;generic&quot; computing company,invading turf that, until very recently, was the sacred cow of SUN, HP, andApollo.andP;  Time will be the true test, of course, but since workstations arenow being integrated into the corporate computing environment, the time isripe for DEC to be a success in this area.andM;Other DEC ProductsandM;In addition to the workstation products described above, DEC also announcedthe following products and/or enhancements on April 3rd:andM;The DECsystem 5830 and 5840.andP;  These are 3 and 4 processor systems which arerated at 62 Integer MIPS and which are priced at $140K and $160K.andP;  The TLZ04DAT tape back-up system provides up to 1.2 GB of back-up on a 4 millimeterdigital audio tape and is priced at $5,500.andM;The RZ24 disk drive is a 209MB drive in a 3.5 inch form factor.andP;  The RZ57 isa 1.0GB capacity drive in a 5-1/4 inch form factor (that's a lot of storageon a hard disk!).andM;TURBOchannel, a new I/O interconnect architecture (see the TURBOchanneldiscussion on page 5).andM;DEC also announced INTENTIONS.andP;  These are basically announcements of productsand/or developments which are designed to provide a statement of directionfor DEC equipment users.andP;  Among the intentions announced were a deskside,multi-user RISC system offering nearly twice the performance of the DECsystem5400 with a price in the $50K range and the intention to offer an adapter toconnect VME bus add-on devices to DECstation workstations via a bus adapter.andM;SoftwareandM;ULTRIX upgrade licenses for RISC systems were reduced in price, 700 thirdparty applications are currently available for DEC RISC-based products(expected to increase to over 1000 by the end of 1990).andM;DEC also announced ULTRIX Version 4.0, DECnet-ULTRIX V4.0, Pascal for RISC,Fortran for RISC, an agreement with Micro Focus to market and distributeCOBOL/2 and Uniplex Business Software.andM;Price ReductionsandM;Price reductions of up to 40% were also announced for the DECstation 2100 and3100 models.andP;  A 19&quot; monochrome DECstation 2100 with a 320MB drive will sellfor $10,500.andP;  Other models also are being reduced in price.andM;FinalandM;All-in-all (or is that All-in-One), DEC had a banner day on the 3rd of April.andO;Like most mid-range computer companies, it is struggling with the future.andO;The workstation market is supposed to grow by over 40% this year (as opposedto 10% for the PC market and 3% for the mini-computer market).andP;  The time isright and the products appear to be right.andP;  Now, can DEC capitalize on all ofthis and regain some of the ground lost in the last few years?andP;  We believethat with products such as those rolled out on April 3rd, the answer will be,&quot;Yes.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
