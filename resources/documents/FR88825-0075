In carrying out that responsibility,ATSDR works, according to its legislative mandate, collaboratively withmedical colleges and States_especially academic medical center clinicswith expertise in environmental health to develop, implement and utilizeeducational materials and improved programs for diagnosing, treating andpreventing injury or disease related to exposure to hazardous substances.<ITAG tagnum="85">Reasons for Proposing Association of Occupational and EnvironmentalClinics as the Recipient of This Cooperative Agreement</ITAG>The Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics is a unique networkof primary care health clinics, associated with academic medical centers,that have shown a unique ability to address health care issues associatedwith hazardous substances. Internally, these clinics emphasize teachingand research based on medical surveillance, screening, biostatistics, andoccupational and environmental health. Externally these clinics featurean active public health focus within their communities. They educate medicalstudents, public health personnel, primary care practitioners and Stateofficials to perform educational and administrative services and academicallybased clinical care, and they promote and maintain the health of the communitiesin which they are located. In addition, the AOEC provides learning experiencesopen to all medical and allied health students so as to increase theirbasic skill and knowledge levels concerning principles of environmentalhealth as related to hazardous substances. Member clinics encourage strongrelationships with primary care disciplines throughout their program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose and Cooperative Activities</ITAG>PurposeThe overall goal of this cooperative agreement is to enhance the educationand practice of health care providers and medical and public health studentsin the areas of surveillance, diagnosing, treating and preventing injuryor illness associated with exposure to hazardous substances.Specific objectives of the agreement areas follow:1. Enhance training of health care providers within an established clinicalsetting in matters of health effects caused by hazardous substances.2. Enhance knowledge and skills in health care providers concerning exposureand disease registries so that they may better serve their local communitiesin providing this service and encouraging its utilization.3. Assist the AOEC in providing leadership and direction to its membershipin encouraging environmentally related primary care activities, and communityoutreach by health care providers concerning issues associated with exposureto hazardous substances.4. Expand the clinical curriculum and variety of field experiences forhealth care providers at the community and State level.5. Enhance the linkage of local health clinics with traditional problemsolving institutions within local communities concerned about the healtheffects of exposures to hazard substances.6. Enlarge medical and scientific knowledge concerning the effects of hazardoussubstances on human health.Cooperative ActivitiesTo achieve the above objectives, the following activities will be performedduring a 3-year period:<ITAG tagnum="81">1.
