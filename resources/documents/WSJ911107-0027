The move is an attempt to prepare for the company'sChapter 11 reorganization plan, which Continental plans tofile later this month. The wage freeze, designed to save thecompany $13.5 million, is only one of a number of actionsbeing taken to enhance revenue and control expenses, saidRobert Ferguson II, vice chairman, in a message to employees.Mr. Ferguson didn't say what the other actions were.</LP><TEXT>   Employees at Continental Airlines, Continental Express,SystemOne and Chelsea Catering will be covered by the freeze,under which all step, merit and longevity increases will bepostponed for six months, Mr. Ferguson said. It's unclear howmany people will be affected.   Continental employees don't have any choice but to acceptthe action because the carrier is non-union. Spokesmen forContinental couldn't be reached for comment.   The move suggests that previous attempts to cutContinental's expenses may not have sliced deep enough. InAugust and September, Continental eliminated 1,400 jobs andrealigned management to save $43 million in personnelexpenses. It also grounded 22 jets and trimmed its capacity6%.   Continental filed for bankruptcy-court protection inDecember, squeezed by a cash crunch and its high debt load.Under its previous chairman, Hollis Harris, it had planned togrow its way out of Chapter 11 but abandoned that strategy inAugust, when Mr. Harris was succeeded by Mr. Ferguson.</TEXT></DOC>
