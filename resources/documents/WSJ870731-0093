Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the previously announced meeting here of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze with Secretary of State George Shultz will be held Sept. 15-17. The two officials will likely work out the details of an arms-control agreement and lay the groundwork for its signing at a summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.    &quot;I wanted to leave at a time that it was clear that things were coming up roses on the first good arms-control agreement that we've had in 10 or 15 years,&quot; said Mr. Adelman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, at a news conference. He added later, &quot;I have no doubt in my own mind we're going to have an agreement this year.&quot;    Washington and Moscow have removed most of the major obstacles in front of a &quot;double zero&quot; agreement under which the superpowers would destroy all their medium-range (greater than 600 miles) and short-range (300-600 miles) nuclear missiles in Europe and Asia. Mr. Adelman suggested that remaining disputes over 72 Pershing 1A West German missiles, for which the U.S. controls the warheads, and over verifying compliance could be easily overcome.    Mr. Adelman, 41 years old, said that he plans to leave in October, but that if a summit meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev is on the horizon, as he expects, he'll stay on longer. He said he announced his resignation in advance to give President Reagan time to find a successor. He also said he timed it after Soviet concessions on arms control last week and before the heat of the summit-planning process to show that he wasn't leaving because of any policy disagreement and so his move wouldn't have any policy implications.    Mr. Gorbachev last week removed a key obstacle to an arms accord by reversing his previous refusal to remove 100 missiles from the Asian part of the Soviet Union. &quot;The Gorbachev announcement last week cleared up a great deal of problems and showed me the Soviets have bought on to the Reagan approach (of deep reductions) lock, stock and barrel and want an agreement with this president this year,&quot; said Mr. Adelman.    However, part of Mr. Adelman's reason for leaving also seems to be that there was little hope for progress on strategic weapons and space defense, issues Reagan administration officials consider far more important than intermediate nuclear forces. The Soviets appear to have put these negotiations on ice, apparently assuming that a future president won't be as committed to space defense systems, funding for which Congress is already reducing.    &quot;Unless the Soviets change fundamentally, we are going to be dead in the water&quot; on strategic weapons and space-defense talks, Mr. Adelman said.    After he leaves the administration, Mr. Adelman will write a column for Washingtonian magazine, engage in speaking tours and work for a think tank. He also hopes to teach Shakespeare, as he did at Georgetown University before joining the administration.    State Department officials also believe there may be a political element to Mr. Adelman's leaving, enabling him to get involved in Republican party politics ahead of the 1988 presidential election.    Mr. Adelman served as deputy U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations from 1981 to 1983, when he became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. </TEXT></DOC>
