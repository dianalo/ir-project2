In Western countries, high-level corruption is often dismissedas the product of human frailty. However, it has been taken moreseriously in Cuba, where the government takes pride in therevolutionary rectitude of its leaders.   ``There is no tradition for this sort of thing here,'' said oneCuban official on condition of anonymity.   Cuba has viewed signs of moral turpitude in the United Statesand other Western countries as an outgrowth of capitalistdecadence, which communist societies are supposed to be able toavoid.   That theory took a beating at the trial of army Maj. Gen.Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez on charges of smuggling tons of drugs intothe United States in an alliance with Colombia's Medellin drugcartel.   Ochoa, once a trusted adviser to President Castro and adesignated hero of the 30-year-old Cuban revolution, had commandedCuban forces in Ethiopia and Angola. He also headed a Cubanmilitary mission in Nicaragua.   He was executed with three other military officers on July 13.Other officers convicted of corruption received lesser sentences.   Castro has not spoken to the Cuban people about the episode, buthe is expected to do so Wednesday in Camaguey, 300 miles east ofHavana.   The speech marks the 36th anniversary of Castro's debut as aguerrilla fighter. The occasion is national holiday and kicks offfestivities throughout the island.   As a reflection of the current mood in Havana, Western reportersarriving to cover the speech were told to avoid human rightsactivists and the relatives of Ochoa or others put to death.   Reversing a policy of greater tolerance, authorities toldreporters that violations of these restrictions could lead toexpulsion from Cuba or denial of future visa requests.   An Associated Press reporter, who was absent when the warningwas issued, interviewed Elizardo Sanchez, president of the CubanCommission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation.   Sanchez called the executions ``murder under legalistic cover,''saying Ochoa and other defendants were denied adequate legal help.   This charge was denied by the Jurists' Union of Cuba, which saidthe defense attorneys carried out their duties with ``greatprofessionalism.''   Supporters of the revolution expressed satisfaction with how theOchoa case was handled, including the decision to execute thedefendants.   Sanchez said the trials occurred at a time of growing economicand political problems.   This view was shared privately by a government official, whosaid the current period is among the most challenging therevolution has faced.   ``These are difficult times, indeed,'' he said.   Sanchez said the economy ``is suffering a slow but sustaineddeterioration.''   His remarks appeared to be borne out by widespread scarcity offood and other consumer goods.   The only sign of bread at one bakery in western Havana werepictures of biscuits and other baked goods on a wall behind thecounter. On the bare shelves, a sign promised bread in two hours.   Insufficient wheat deliveries from the Soviet Union are blamedfor the bread shortages.</TEXT></DOC>
