Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said Moscow's economicembargo was tantamount to it recognizing his Baltic republic'sindependence.   A Soviet energy official, however, said the Lithuanians got whatthey deserved for defying President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who onFriday threatened to cut off supplies unless they rescinded theirindependence-oriented laws.   A Lithuanian government spokesman appealed over Vilnius Radiotoday for fuel conservation, ``and maybe we will not be intimidatedby these sanctions.''   As the events in Lithuania unfolded, Gorbachev met in theKremlin today with leaders of Latvia and Estonia and offeredconcessions and made threats in an effort to keep them in theSoviet Union, participants said.   Gorbachev offered both republics ``special status'' in theSoviet Union if they drop their attempts to follow Lithuania intoindependence, said Raymond Lochmelis of the Latvian Popular Frontand other officials present.   The Soviet leader also proposed a loose confederative systeminstead of a union tightly controlled by the center. He alsoreportedly threatened to end the talks unless Estonia rescinded itsclaim that it is an occupied independent state and Latvia canceledits plan to declare independence on May 3.   The flow of natural gas to Lithuania was shut off in threepipelines _ two from Latvia and one from Minsk in Byelorussia _reducing supplies to Lithuania by more than 80 percent, Lithuanianlawmakers said.   A fourth pipeline from Slonim in Byelorussia that suppliesLithuania continued to provide 3.5 million cubic meters of gas tothe republic, guaranteeing ``a normal supply of gas for residentsand communal domestic use in the Lithuanian S.S.R.,'' parliamentaryofficials quoted the Byelorussian gas concern's telegram as saying.   That leaves Lithuania with only 16 percent of the gas it needsper day. Lithuania uses an average of 18 million cubic meters dailyfor industrial and domestic use.   Lithuanian officials estimate the republic has enough oil tolast six weeks to three months.   Juozas Martusevicius, a Lithuanian electrical official, saidMoscow officials guaranteed that enough natural gas would besupplied to keep Lithuania's Elektrenai power plant functioning.The plant also serves customers in the neighboring Russian republicterritory of Kaliningrad. Lithuania's sole nuclear power station,in Ignalina, is shut down for repairs.   Lithuania is entirely dependent on Moscow for oil and gas, andthe embargo was the toughest action Gorbachev has taken in hiseffort to force the republic of 3.8 million people to rescind itsMarch 11 declaration of independence.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said todaythat Moscow ``might have some other restrictions'' to impose onLithuania, but he refused to elaborate.   Late Wednesday night, the oil to Lithuania's only refinerystopped flowing through a pipeline feeding the plant from theRussian city of Polotsk, according to Bronius Vainoras, director ofthe facility.   Vainoras told the British Broadcasting Corp. that the refinerywill have to close if supplies are not restored. Half of therefinery was working but at a reduced capacity, he said.   Landsbergis, speaking after Lithuania's parliament had refused aKremlin ultimatum and instead offered to negotiate, saidGorbachev's move represented ``economic coercion and economicwarfare against a neighboring country.''   ``Truly, this is recognition of the independence of Lithuania,''he said. ``It is hard to imagine why the people of Lithuania,irrespective of nationality and creed, are being punished. What wastheir crime?''   In Moscow, Deputy Oil Minister Lev Dmitrievich Churilov said hisdepartment cut off the oil _ mostly Siberian crude _ afterreceiving a decree from the Soviet Council of Ministers orderingthe shutdown ``until further special notice.''   Lithuania's Mazhiekiai refinery processes about 12 million tonsof petroleum products a year. Lithuania uses about a quarter of theoutput, journalists quoted Lithuanian government officials assaying.   Neighboring Baltic states Latvia and Estonia _ themselves movingalong a slower path toward independence _ won't be hurt by thecutoff to Lithuania, Churilov said. Lithuania's supplies will nowgo to the republics of Byelorussia, the Ukraine and Russia, as wellas Eastern Europe, he said.   Noting that he was expressing his personal opinion, Churilovtold The Associated Press that the cutoff might teach theLithuanians a lesson.   ``Maybe this measure can make them think a little,'' he said.``They should not respond to appeals from the president andgovernment with ultimatums.''   Lithuanian officials met today to discuss the cuts in energysupplies, said spokesman Ceslovas Jursenas, with the priority beinggiven to the power industry, bakeries and the food industry.   He said that in the areas of fuel and power, Lithuanians wouldbe put on ``a starvation diet.''   ``Where we can give up the use of gas, petrol, any heating orlighting, let us do this, and then we will be able to survivelonger and, maybe, we will not be intimidated by these sanctions,''Jursenas said in his appeal.   Sales of gasoline in Lithuania tripled this week as motoristsreacted to Gorbachev's threat with panic-buying, said LithuanianEnergy Minister Leonas Asmantas.   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was in Norwaytoday, seeking oil to help offset the embargo. Norwegian PrimeMinister Jan P. Syse said his country has not promised oil suppliesto Lithuania.   ``We don't expect the world to give us any concrete goods at themoment ... all we are after is moral support,'' Mrs. Prunskienesaid. ``We believe Lithuania will survive without natural gas butlife will be reduced, cut off from normal possibilities.''   The White House said today that President Bush was consultingwith U.S. allies on ``appropriate responses'' to the Lithuaniancrisis.   Prior to the cutoff, Secretary of State James A. Baker III saidaction against Lithuania could destroy commercial relations betweenthe Soviet Union and the United States.   ``It's very difficult to see some of the commercial aspects ofour relationship surviving the use of force or coercion'' he said.   Gorbachev has declared unconstitutional Lithuania's moves tocurtail the spring draft into the Soviet army, give residentsLithuanian identity cards and seize the property of the CommunistParty on Lithuanian territory.   Lithuania was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 alongwith the fellow Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia.</TEXT></DOC>
