It will feature demonstrations of Sovietsoftware, Soviet market research data, a research library and a Sovietspeakers bureau.andM;Amstrong tells Newsbytes that monetary restrictions, and specifically theinability to cash rubles in the U.S., will no longer stand in the way ofSoviet deals with the US since a bank in Europe is being set up to convertrubles to dollars.andP;  He adds that most people don't realize that the Sovietsalready have a great deal of hard currency to use.andM;He says one resource Moscow can offer the U.S.andP;  is &quot;brain power.&quot; In Moscowalone, there are 600,000 people with PhDs.andP;  He says the Soviets &quot;produceexcellent programmers, whose talents will be available on the internationalmarketplace.andP;  So for $800 a month you can hire a programmer for any language.andO;This represents quite a resource for new venture products.&quot;andM;Opportunities abound for US firms seeking to sell their wares in the U.S.S.R.andO;While the Soviets now have approximately 600,000 PCs, their desire is to have20 million by the year 2000.andM;The Soviets are also taking steps to use their satellites for commercialrather than strictly military purposes, he says.andM;(Wendy Woods/19900517/Press Contact: Rebecca Hurst, PR, Global DevelopmentCorp., 408/562-6230)</TEXT></DOC>
