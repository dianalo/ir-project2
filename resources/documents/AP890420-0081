Buses and roads were crowded during the morning rush-hour with 3million subway commuters trying to find other ways to enter thecity during the worst of the two unofficial strikes on the126-year-old London Underground.   Only three of the 10 subway lines were operating, but serviceswere reduced to about one-third or half of normal, a transitspokesman said.   In the April 5 strike, three lines operated fully and othersoffered partial services.   Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of the Underground, saidthe striking drivers were ignoring union advice to keep working.   Drivers on strike were demanding more money for working ontrains that eventually will be operated alone after the phasing outof conductors who open and close doors.   The subway employs 2,400 drivers.</TEXT></DOC>
