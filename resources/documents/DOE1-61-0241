Asbestosis and silicosis are well known examples of thistype of disease. There are slow, progressive processes that may taketen years of chronic exposure and several decades post-exposure beforeclinical manifestation. The pathogenesis of the human disease and animalmodels of chronic exposure have been well described. Despite years ofinvestigation, the initial pathogenic events and basic cellular mechanismsthat lead to the development of interstitial lung disease remain largelyunknown. To address this issue, this paper is intended to describe someof our recent findings on initial particle deposition patterns, epithelialcell-particle interactions, mechanisms of membrane toxicity, macrophage-particleinteractions, and measurements of initial anatomic lesions.</TEXT></DOC>
