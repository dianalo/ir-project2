A joint venture agreement gives a group of Texas entrepreneursexclusive rights to market products and services of the Soviet spaceagency, Glavkosmos, in the United States.   ``The Soviets couldn't be nicer. You couldn't ask for betterbunch of partners,'' said Buck Hightower, a founder of theHouston-based Space Commerce Corp., which is selling everything fromofficial Glavkosmos T-shirts to launch services for U.S. satellitecompanies wanting to hitch a ride on a Soviet Proton rocket.   During a break from overseeing a crowded T-shirt stand at theentrance to the U.S.S.R. Pavilion at the Paris Air Show in mid-June,Hightower recalled how a group of Texas red necks found themselvesdoing business on Red Square.   ``We were trying to sell some idle oilfield equipment to theSoviets,'' Hightower said, adding that the Texas good ol' boynetwork led him to Arthur Dula, a Houston aerospace attorney andformer NASA consultant who had broad Moscow contacts. ``We got toknow the neighbors.''   Glasnost was booming, U.S. rocket companies were unable to meetAmerican business' demand for launch services, ``so we decided toengage in a little creative international trade,'' Hightower said.   They rang Alexandr Dunayev, head of Glavkosmos, ``who thought itwas a fine idea,'' Hightower said. The high sheriffs at the U.S.State Department weren't so sure.   Dula, now president of Space Commerce, wanted the Soviet rocketto blast off from a U.S. site carrying the first payload, twocommunications satellites for Hughes Aircraft.   The State Department said no way.   The Texans then decided to launch from the Soviet Union. Underthe Reagan administration, the State Department denied an exportlicense to Hughes.   Under the Bush administration, the Texans have found a morereceptive State Department and they plan to apply for another exportlicense soon, Dula said in a telephone interview from Houston thispast week.   If the license is denied again, his Texas company will launch theSoviet rocket from another country such as Australia or Brazil andwill haul a payload containing no American parts. The fee for a rideon the Red rocket is about $30 million.   Besides T-shirts and rockets, Space Commerce also offers a rangeof other Soviet space agency services, including navigational aidsand flights aboard the space station Mir.   Moreover, Space Commerce can write contracts for advertisers whowant to proclaim their product or service on the side of a Sovietrocket. The Soviets disclosed recently that they want to exploitcommercial opportunities that their space program has created,including putting ads in space, seen by millions of televisionviewers during blastoffs.   In addition, Space Commerce soon plans to conduct tours to Sovietspace facilities never before open to the public _ American orSoviet.   Tourists will be able to visit the Mission Control Center atKaliningrad near Moscow, or Star City, where cosmonauts train, withsidetrips to the Bolshoi Ballet and the Moscow Circus.   ``Our feeling is that there must be a place in the world economyfor the Soviet Union,'' said Hightower, who also heads an Austinproperty development company.   During the air show last month, the Space Commerce partners did abrisk business selling T-shirts, mostly to American visitors.   Approached quietly by a gray-haired man in a business suit,partner Robert R. Brandes said: ``No sir, just T-shirts here. Theback part is where they're selling the rockets.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday July 17</NOTE></DOC>
