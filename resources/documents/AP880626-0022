SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sunspot activity is increasing rapidly and,during the next few years, could lead to the most intense solardisturbances ever recorded, the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration said Sunday.   Intense disturbances on the sun can have serious effects onEarth, including interference with broadcasting, damage tosensitive electronic systems in satellites and disturbances inelectrical power and telephone transmissions.   Some scientists also have speculated that activity on the suncould affect the climate on Earth, an idea that has promptedconsiderable controversy in the meteorological community.   Changes in rainfall patterns have occurred roughly in parallelwith changes on the sun over the years. However, proving that thetwo are connected has, so far, eluded science.   Sunspots occur in cycles of approximately 11 years.Climatologists have found slight variations in rainfall patterns inthe United States over periods of 11 years in the central andwestern states and over 22 years in the eastern states.   The current cycle began in September 1986 and already has seenrecord rates of increase in sunspots and radiation from the sun,according to Gary Heckman, head of the NOAA-Air Force SpaceEnvironment Services Center in Boulder, Colo.   The most active previous solar cycle occurred in 1958. Activityon the sun is already at about the same rate as in that year, butwith somewhat more intensity.   Heckman noted that in a typical cycle sunspots increase to theirmaximum in about 4.3 years and then take some 6.6 years to declineto a minimum again. But cycles with rapid increases, as in thecurrent case, have higher and earlier maximum levels.   Sunspots themselves do not affect the Earth, but are used asindicators of other solar activity which does, such as solar flaresand geomagnetic storms, bombarding the Earth with radiation.   Among the potential problems associated with an increase insolar activity, according to Heckman, are:   _Increasing activity by the aurora borealis or northern lights(also the aurora australis, or southern lights, in Antarctica).   _Interference with some kinds of radio communications andbroadcasts.   _Disturbances in electrical power transmission systems,pipelines and long-line telephone networks.   _Damage to satellites' electronic systems.   _Altered orbits of some satellites.   _Radiation hazards to astronauts and aircraft passengers at highaltitudes.</TEXT></DOC>
