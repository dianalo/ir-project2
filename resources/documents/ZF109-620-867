 Faced with budget cuts, consolidations, system anarchy and thethreat of outsourcing, information systems managers have learned that thesurvival of the fittest is more than an academic theory.andM;&quot;Most data centers have been fat, dumb and happy over the years,&quot; says ArnoldFarber, president of Farber/LaChance, a Richmond, Va., consulting firm thatspecializes in information systems automation.andP;  Few have that luxury anymore.andM;The challenges besetting data centers have been something of a windfall forfirms that sell IS automation products.andP;  Such products--both hardware andsoftware--can boost system efficiency and availability and can slash thecosts of running IS shops.andM;IS managers looking to automate their operations have no shortage of options.andO;On the hardware front, managers can buy robotic tape handlers that mount,remove and archive reels of magnetic tape without human intervention.andP;  Orthey can purchase roll feeders that keep ravenous printer spools satiated.andM;Most automation activity, though, is software based.andP;  Various packagesautomatically intercept and respond to operating system messages, schedulejobs, distribute reports and restart computer systems aftershutdowns--scheduled or not.andP;  Automated consoles act as hubs, performing someof these functions, coordinating other tasks and permitting operators tomonitor and direct various automation packages from one terminal.andM;Keeping Up With The 3090sandM;Budget constraints and outsourcing threats aside, automated systemsoperations (ASO) software has become a fixture at many IS shops for a morebasic reason: operators can no longer keep pace with the systems themselves.andO;For example, an IBM 3090-600 running the MVS operating system generates anaverage of 20 messages per second, and can spike up to 100 messages persecond, says Charles Roming, product marketing manager for MVS AutoOperator,an auto console product from Boole andamp; Babbage Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif.andM;&quot;Only about 10% of the MVS messages require operator intervention, so whyshould they even be presented?&quot; Roming asks.andP;  A common first step ofautomation, therefore, is to suppress extraneous messages.andP;  Those remainingmay be automatically handled by ASO software directed to a screen foroperator handling.andM;Beyond message suppression, IS personnel need help managing the many systemenvironments and user interfaces found in today's data centers.andP;  &quot;Because ofthe helter-skelter growth that has occurred within most shops, operatorscan't leverage their skills from one environment to another,&quot; says JeffSchulman, vice president of software management strategies at the Stamford,Conn.-based market research firm Gartner Group Inc.andM;Despite the capability of automation tools to help data center managersregain control of their systems and costs, many managers worry that thesoftware will be difficult to implement.andP;  They also fear the ramifications ofdeviating from their long-standing operations practices, even though many ofthose practices no longer work.andM;Automate In Haste, Repent In LeisureandM;ASO vendors and consultants alike say these fears have little foundation, butnevertheless they caution IS managers to approach automation withwell-though-out plans and reasonable goals.andP;  Shops that automate haphazardlyunder the gun of budget crunches or outsourcing threats probably won'trealize the full benefits of the technology.andM;&quot;A crucial first step is to define your existing metrics,&quot; advises FredLuevano, director of disaster recovery and security at Hawthorne,Calif.-based northrop aircraft division of Northrop Corp., which isheadquartered in Century City, Calif.andP;  &quot;Many data centers implementautomation products and then have no way to report on their progress.&quot;andM;About six years ago, Northrop began a formal automation effort with severalconcrete objectives, Luevano says.andP;  &quot;Our primary focus was to make Northropinformation services more customer service oriented.andP;  And we set specificpercentage goals to improve things like system response time andavailability.&quot;andM;Northrop's centerpiece ASO product is the AF/Operator console from LosAngeles-based Candle Corp.andP;  With this and ancillary automation software, theaircraft manufacturer has reduced message handling by 98% and custom formsuse by 50%.andP;  The operations staff has also been cut by 30% over the lastthree years, but this staff reduction was a byproduct of Northrop'sautomation efforts, Luevano says, not a primary goal.andM;Another common pitfall, says Gartner Group's Schulman, is to make only ahalf-hearted effort to automate.andP;  Real benefits aren't realized until theautomation program reaches a critical mass, he says.andM;&quot;If you install a job scheduler and then run only 40 to 50% of your jobs onit, it's a waste of time,&quot; Schulman says.andP;  &quot;You need to run at least 80 to90% of the jobs under the scheduler to make the automation pay off.&quot;andM;Although ASO software encompasses a broad range of functions, many peopleassociate automation with the products known as automated consoles.andP;  Atpresent, there are 22 such products on the market, says consultant Farber.andM;Auto consoles typically monitor operating system messages and filter outthose of little consequence.andP;  Most of these products can also be programmedto institute actions based on the messages they receive--actionstraditionally performed manually by system operators.andM;Among the most important of these functions is the ability to automaticallyrestart a system when it crashes.andP;  This feature can boost system availabilityand keep demanding users happy.andM;Capital Bank of Miami uses CA-Opera, a console automation product fromComputer Associates International Inc., to ensure that its IBM 3090-120S andIBM 9370 stay up over weekends for automated teller machine (ATM) andtelephone transactions.andP;  &quot;We acquired the software to give our customers whatthey need when they need it,&quot; says George Rodriguez, the bank's vicepresident of operations.andP;  &quot;People get really irate at ATMs when they're outof service.&quot;andM;The bank also uses a sister product called CA-Opera/PC, which permitsoperators to interact with computers remotely.andP;  If a problem developes thatCA-Opera can't handle, the system pages an on-call operator who can useCA-Opera/PC to link into the computers and manually direct recoveryprocedures.andP;  A number of other auto console vendors, including Boole andamp;Babbage, Candle and Legent Corp., also offer remote versions.andM;Legent was the first to introduce an open interface to link its consoleproducts to job schedulers, tape managers and other automation toolsregardless of their source, says Suzanne M. Nicastro, product manager for thecompany's AutoMate line.andP;  This open interface, since incorporated into anumber of automated consoles, has permitted these consoles to emerge as theoverseers and integrators of the automation world.andM;This integration, though, is fairly limited.andP;  Open interfaces allow disparateautomation products to interact on a basic level, and the auto consoles canconsolidate the operator screens that would otherwise appear on severaldispersed terminals.andP;  But even though the screens appear on one terminal,user interfaces still differ from product to product.andP;  And because differentautomation packages rarely share the same database, they can often interactonly superficially.andM;Moving Toward Integration ProductsandM;Many automation vendors have been moving to more fully integrate the productsthey sell.andP;  This trend was invigorated in September by IBM's announcement ofSystemView, an enterprisewide architecture for systems management.andP;  Acritical aspect of SystemView is the establishment of a common database thatwould be shared by all application packages, says John Keyes, seniormarketing support administrator for IBM's data system software marketingprogram.andM;&quot;With a common set of data for operations, the coordination of functions,including automation, will become much easier,&quot; he says.andM;Currently, only one ASO software firm, Tone Software Corp. of Anaheim,Calif., attains this ideal of a common database in its family of automationproducts, says consultant Farber.andP;  Tone products currently include a jobrestart package, a report distributor, a job scheduler and a remote printerpackage.andP;  The company will introduce an auto console product during thefourth quarter, says president John W. Hutchison.andM;&quot;All our products have a common look and feel and permit excellent skillleveraging as well as a single point of control,&quot; he says.andM;While vendors like Tone concentrate on integrating their own software, theycan't ignore integration within the data center itself.andP;  Most data centersnow run a mix of vendor systems, and managers are crying for ASO productsthat run not only on IBM equipment but also on computers from DigitalEquipment Corp., Tandem Computers Inc. and Unisys Corp. as well as UNIX-basedsystems.andM;With perhaps the broadest line of automation software in the industry,Computer Associates has already moved strongly into the Digital environment,says Clarence Murray, vice president of marketing for automated productioncontrol and automated storage management products.andP;  &quot;We will probably haveUNIX-based automation products available within one year,&quot; he estimates.andM;Automation TrendsandM;To implement any of the auto consoles, users must customize the products tomatch their system configurations and operational practices.andP;  A number of theleading packages offer menu-type dialogues or rule based languages thatenable nonprogrammers to set system parameters.andM;Another feature shared by several console products is a scripting capabilitythat records operators' keystrokes as they perform various tasks.andP;  Thekeystroke sequences become part of the consoles' programming, and can beautomatically reproduced.andM;Several vendors, including Boole andamp; Babbage and Candle, link their automationproducts to their own performance monitors.andP;  And they are moving to increasethe ability of ASO software to operate proactively as system performancedegrades.andP;  Boole andamp; Babbage pioneered the use of expert systems technology inits performance monitors; that company and others are working to buildknowledge bases to drive their ASO products.andM;Such expert system technology is contributing to a trend toward &quot;lights out&quot;operations, a holy grail sought by all ASO software vendors.andP;  Most vendorssay they've found this holy grail and can provide it to the data centermanager.andP;  Once automation products are installed, says Violet Hom, productmanager for automated facilities products at Candle, &quot;it's like having yourbest operator on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&quot;andM;Although vendors believe they can offer such maintenance-free operations, ISmanagers tend to be skeptical.andP;  Says consultant Farber: &quot;Smaller shopsbelieve only the large shops have the clout to achieve lights-out operations.andO;For their part, big shops think there's no way their sophisticated operationswill be automated.&quot;andM;Farber believes it's possible to turn out data center lights.andP;  &quot;Thedifference in success from one company to another in achieving [lights outoperations] is strictly a difference in mindset.andP;  The hardest part of my jobis getting people to change the way they think.&quot;andM;Dwight Davis is a freelance writer residing in Seattle.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
