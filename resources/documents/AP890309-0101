Prodded by increasing scientific evidence thatchlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs, are destroying the ozone shield,the West has promised to ban or significantly reduce their use bythe end of the century.   Third World countries do not dispute the facts and figures, butare just embarking on large-scale expansion of refrigeration, airconditioning, plastics and electronics industries, most of whichdepend on CFCs.   ``This raises a major moral problem in the West,'' Australia'sscience minister acknowledged at an international conference inLondon this week on the ozone layer, which filters outcancer-causing ultraviolet rays from the sun.   ``Can we ask the developed world to adopt lower standards ofconvenience and amenity than we do?'' asked the minister, BarryJones.   The dispute recalls the 1960s debate over the insecticide DDT.The West discovered it was harmful to both plants and animals andimposed bans or restrictions in 1970-71 against the wishes ofdeveloping nations, which feared a resurgence of disease-carryinginsects.   Another environmental issue dividing the West from the Thirdworld is the dumping of toxic waste.   President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya told the London conferencethat recent dumpings in Africa of toxic chemicals from industrialcountries were ``unfriendly actions ... equivalent to declaring waron the Earth's ecosystem.''   On the ozone issue, developing countries demand Western help infinancing any switch from CFCs to safe substitutes.   The chemicals, developed in the United States more than 50 yearsago as the working fluid for refrigerators, also are used inaerosols, fast-food packaging and computer solvents. About 1.2million tons are produced annually, more than 76 percent in theUnited States and European Economic Community.   When CFCs reach the stratosphere 15-25 miles up, as much as 100years after emission, they break apart and their chlorine atomsdeplete the fragile ozone layer. CFCs also trap heat, increasingEarth's temperature in a process known as the greenhouse effect.   ``The adverse effects are going to be more serious for developingcountries due to their geographical situation and limited ability tofund defensive strategies,'' said physicist Mohammed Ilyas of theUniversity of Science of Malaysia.   In 1977, the United States announced it was phasing out the useof CFCs in aerosols. Canada, Norway and Sweden followed suit.   Washington now says it will ban all CFCs by 1999 if safesubstitutes become available. The 12-nation EEC has agreed to asimilar timetable but its environment commissioner, Carlo Ripa diMeana, wants an earlier target.   Australia plans a phaseout by 1998 and Japan says it will agreeto a ban if other countries do. The Soviet Union says it needs morescientific evidence of the damage.   Thirty-one countries have ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocolrequiring the amount of CFCs to be cut in half by 1999. Theirrepresentatives will meet in Helsinki, Finland, in May for the firstfull review of the treaty.   Another 20 countries have agreed to sign up, but China, India andBrazil, with rapidly growing populations, are not among them. Theyhave urged Western nations to create a fund to help them acquiretechnology to replace CFCs, but insist the money not be deductedfrom existing aid.   ``Any reduction in these resources for whatever reasons wouldmean that the poor of these countries will have to wait longer forthe promised freedom from hunger and poverty,'' said Z.R. Ansari,India's environment minister. ``The poor are no more prepared towait and there will be social upheaval if they are asked to wait anylonger.''   China's environment commissioner, Liu Ming Pu, told theconference his nation of 1.1 billion people uses less than 2 percentof the world's CFCs.   Western nations say the potential for CFC use in the developingworld is enormous and could wipe out any cuts made by industrialcountries.   Even if all CFCs were banned immediately, scientists estimate twocenturies would be needed to repair the damage.   The West wants developing countries to bypass CFCs and movedirectly to safe substitutes, which still being developed and may bemore expensive.   Considerable sympathy was evident at the conference for the ThirdWorld argument, which Britain's Prince Charles called ``a powerfulone.''   Jones, the Australian minister, said if his country was entitledto a refrigerator in each of its 4 million households ``then itought to be appropriate for 250 to 300 million Chinese households.''</TEXT></DOC>
