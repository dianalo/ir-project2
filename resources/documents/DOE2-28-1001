<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-1001 </DOCNO><TEXT>For the past 2 years, test activities at the three Department of EnergyHEPA Filter Test Facilities (FTFs) have been conducted under a unifiedset of operating standards intended to help achieve consistency in testmethods and test results. Reviews of test operations are conducted ateach FTF annually, and technical support and guidance are provided onrequest. Round Robin tests are conducted twice a year to compare penetrationand resistance test results among the three FTFs. The FTFs prepare summarytest data twice a year, and the data is analyzed for trends with respectto ongoing quality of HEPA filters in nuclear facilities. Data and conclusionsfrom both the Round Robin tests and semiannual reports are discussed,the latter without reference to specific manufacturers. The new DOE standardsinclude provisions for consideration and approval of new test aerosolsor test methods, under closely controlled change procedures. Progressin obtaining DOE approval for DOS as a new aerosol, and for the AlternativeTest System (ATS) developed by, and reported on by the LANL, as an approvednew test method are discussed, as are 2 significant changes in standardNE-F-3-43, related to (a) toxicology test alternatives, and (b) the testaerosol definition. Finally, the emergence of new, higher flow ratedHEPA filters and Ultra Low Particulate Air (ULPA) filters will impactDOE's design, procurement, testing and use of HEPA filters in the nearfuture.</TEXT></DOC>
