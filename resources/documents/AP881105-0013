Polls leading up to the vote indicate only 38 percent of theeligible voters will cast ballots. Of those who said they would goto the polls, 84 percent said they would approve the plan.   Periodic violence has broken out in the territory since November1984 between native Melanesians, known locally as Kanaks, and whitesettlers, called Caldoches. Nearly 40 people have been killed.   On April 22, Melanesians attacked a police station on the islandof Ouvea, killing four policemen and taking 27 others hostage. OnMay 5, an assault on a cave where the kidnappers held the hostageskilled two more policemen and 19 Kanaks.   The latest attacks sobered Caledonians, native and European, andcaused them to rethink their attitudes.   The plan to be voted on Sunday has attracted great support inmainland France. Governing Socialists, Communists, and center-rightUnion for French Democracy all are backing a ``yes'' vote on Sunday.   Premier Michel Rocard has taken a front-line role in the campaign.   ``I don't want there to be any more violence and deaths in NewCaledonia,'' the premier said. ``I say no to civil war, and the onlymeans of preventing this danger is the `yes' in the referendum,'' hesaid.   The conservative Rally for the Republic is campaigning forabsention. It says it cannot disavow its local arm, which agreed tothe plan, but also cannot vote for it because of constitutionalobjections.   France's Socialist government is asking voters Sunday to approvemeasures set out in 96 articles of a long draft law that few peoplehave read and, because of its legalistic language, even fewer haveunderstood.   Some people interviewed by newspapers and television seem tothink they are voting directly on independence for New Caledonia.Others are not sure exactly what they are voting for, though somesay they will vote anyway.   The essential provision is for a local referendum in 10 years todecide if the territory becomes independent or remains French.   Meanwhile, the new law would divide New Caledonia into threeprovinces, each with its own local assembly, and an electedterritorial congress with no pre-determined ethnic breakdown. Theterritory would be ruled directly from Paris until next summer, whenthe new bodies and local administration would take over.   The population of the archipelago, controlled by France since1853, is 145,000.   Forty-three percent are native Melanesians mostly favoringindependence. But they are in the minority because most Polynesiansand Asians support the European community of 37 percent thatgenerally wants to remain French.   The plan to be put before French voters Sunday came out of Junediscussions between Jean-Marie Tjibaou, leader of the KanakSocialist National Liberation Front, and Jacques Lafleur, head ofanti-independence Rally for Caledonia in the Republic. They met inParis with Rocard, and the resulting plan was lauded as one of thesuccesses of Rocard's new government.   A referendum on independence was held in the territory Sept. 13,1987, when local voters supported remaining French by 98.3 percentto 1.7 percent. But the main Melanesian group had called for aboycott, keeping turnout to 59 percent.   All eligible French voters, including those in New Caledonia andother overseas territories, may vote Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
