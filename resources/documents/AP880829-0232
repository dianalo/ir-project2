The national Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta, reviewedthe progress toward the government's 15 top-priority goals forAmerican nutrition in 1990, including raising public knowledge ofthe effects of salt and lowering average blood-cholesterol levels.   ``Substantial progress'' has been made in several areas, andthree of the goals will be fully met, researchers said.   But despite the progress, Americans will probably fall short ofeight major goals, including that of getting people to lose weight,said Ms. Nestle, whose office helped prepare the report.   ``The research that relates (poor) diet to disease is nowincontrovertible,'' she said. ``It's really time now to startlooking at ways to implement the recommendations that everybody isfamiliar with _ ways to improve the nutritional status of thepopulation.''   The goals that will likely not be met, she said, are:   _ Having less than 10 percent of American men and 17 percent ofAmerican women over the ``significantly overweight'' level, definedas more than 20 percent over desired weight.   _ Having 50 percent of the overweight population on aweight-loss program combining diet and exercise. The CDC saidrecent surveys show half the nation's overweight people are indeedtrying to lose weight _ but only half are using both diet andexercise.   _ Cutting the average adult level of harmful serum cholesterolbelow the 200 count. In a 1976-80 survey, average cholesterollevels were 211 for women and 215 for men, down from 214 and 217 in1971-74. ``That rate of decline is not as fast as it should be,''Ms. Nestle said.   _ Having at least three-fourths of all mothers breast-feedingtheir babies at the time they leave the hospital. A 1984 survey putthe figure at 61 percent, up from 45 percent in 1978.   _ Having all packaged foods labeled with ``useful calorie andnutrient information.'' Such is the case in 55 percent of packagedfoods, up from 42 percent in 1978, Ms. Nestle said.   _ Including nutrition education in the required schoolcurriculum in all states. By 1985, only 12 states had such arequirement, the CDC said.   The three objectives that researchers think will be fully met,she said, are:   _ Having more than 75 percent of the population aware ofnutritional risks for conditions such as heart disease and highblood pressure (fats and salt) and tooth decay (between-mealsweets). Awareness already runs as high as 90 percent in somecategories, the CDC report said.   _ Having 90 percent of U.S. adults aware that to lose weightthey must eat fewer calories or increase physical activity, orboth. The percentage was 73 in 1985 and is rising quickly, Ms.Nestle said.   _ Implementation of a comprehensive national nutrition statusmonitoring system. It is already in place, the CDC reported.</TEXT></DOC>
