Champion International andits subcontractor, Rockwell International Corporation, have conducted researchand development in black liquor gasification since 1981. A gasifier producinggas for use in combined-cycle cogeneration shows high potential as an alternativeto the Tomlinson Recovery Boiler. The unsolicited proposal is for a 15tons per day unit which, when tested, could culminate in the building ofa larger pilot unit at a pulp and paper mill site. The proposed effort is to be partially funded in Fiscal Year 1988. Completionof the 15 tons per day phase will be subject to availability of funds inlater years. The proposed effort, involving an estimated 11.4 man-years,is to be completed within a 27-month time period from start of the contract.This notification provides an opportunity for pulp and paper companies,and equipment manufacturers, to consider participation in funding the 15TPD pilot unit. DOE feels that the gasifier project could provide significantbenefits for paper-makers and equipment manufacturers and should be continuedto commercialization. This notice represents the only official notice ofintent on the part of DOE.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Request for information regarding the proposed contractand written responses to this notice shall be addressed to:<ITAG tagnum="15">U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Industrial Programs, CE-142,Room 5F-044, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ATTN: Mr. S.F.
