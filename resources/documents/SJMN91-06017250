The White House is closed to tourists for theduration. Even before the official pronouncement of war Wednesday, policemoved in around the State Department, closing the underground garage anddiverting traffic to side streets.;    And at nuclear power plants, atmilitary recruiting stations and at the embassies of Gulf allies, the antennaeof suspicion are going up.;    &quot;I don't think anyone really thinks that wehave a serious problem here (in the United States),&quot; said Neil Livingstone, aWashington-based counter-terrorism specialist.;    &quot;But there is still thisaspect of whether they want to take one pop at us, hit us where we live,&quot;Livingstone added. &quot;Just the very fact that they could get one attack offcreates a certain amount of panic and apprehension.&quot;;    Security wasespecially tight at San Francisco International Airport, where officers withbomb-sniffing dogs patrolled terminals and passengers were warned thatunattended bags or packages would be collected and destroyed.;    Six to 12such bags or packages are being reported daily, Whittaker said, but none havebeen confiscated because owners have returned after a few minutes.;   Mailboxes and trash bins -- would-be hiding places for bombs -- were removedfrom terminals and placed outside near parking islands.;    Security officerswarned motorists that unattended cars in front of terminals would be towedimmediately, but Whittaker said only four to six such cars have been taggedeach day and owners have always returned so quickly no towing has beennecessary. Curbside baggage service was eliminated.;    &quot;We've seen somedecline in passengers taking flights over the past few days,&quot; said Ron Wilson,San Francisco International Airport spokesman;    San Jose passengers,however, weren't particularly worried this morning. &quot;I guess I just haven'tbeen concerned about terrorism,&quot; said Becky Crandall, 27, as she and her21-month-old son waited to return to Ft. Worth.;    A man who refused to givehis name was a tad more worried. &quot;We are concerned, but we are willing to waitlonger,&quot; he said.;    Somewhat longer waits are resulting from the eliminationof curbside baggage checking at major airports. In addition, only passengerswith tickets are being allowed beyond security checkpoints.;    Frank McGuire,editor of the bi-weekly Security Intelligence Report, questioned whether theFAA and the airports have the resources to raise security on domestic flightsto the level of precautions taken on international flights.;    &quot;They wouldlike to create the perception that the whole system is locked up tight, butyou know in the real world you can't do that,&quot; said McGuire. &quot;There are budgetlimitations; there are manpower limitations.&quot;;    At local defense firms,officials were ready. &quot;We're aware of heightened risks and we're actingaccordingly,&quot; said Bob Burgess, a spokesman for Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co.in Sunnyvale. &quot;But we don't discuss (the details of our) security.&quot;;   Lockheed, the largest corporate employer in Silicon Valley with 21,300workers, makes the Trident submarine-launched nuclear missile and a number ofsurveillance and communication satellites.;    FMC Corp., which builds theBradley Fighting Vehicle for the U.S. Army in San Jose, tightened its securityprocedures, said spokesman Bill Highlander. Last week, FMC canceled foreigntravel for its employees unless absolutely necessary.;    Fearingdemonstrators would infiltrate stations and key locations, BART hired privatesecurity guards to supplement its police force, said spokesman Sy Mouber.;   BART also locked all public bathrooms and elevators; patrons will have to callon station agents to use these facilities. Bike lockers and personal lockersalso have been locked.;    San Francisco Police Chief William Casey also saidhe will increase security at City Hall and for Sunday's playoff football gameat Candlestick Park.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOANNE GRANT AND JIM DICKEY, Mercury News Staff Writers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910117  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  794  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 17, 199100017250,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
