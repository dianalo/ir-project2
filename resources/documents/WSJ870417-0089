Unexpectedly large gains in Avon's U.S. beauty business helped earnings, Mr. Waldron said in an interview.    Securities analysts had expected a flat first quarter for the beauty and health-care company.    &quot;The fundamentals beneath those earnings are solid,&quot; Mr. Waldron said.    Avon expects to report first-quarter net income increased to nearly $19 million, or 27 cents a share, from $17.7 million, or 24 cents a share, a year ago, he said.    Mr. Waldron estimated first-quarter sales grew 13% to $690 million from $608.5 million a year ago.    A number of acquisitions are in the company's future, Mr. Waldron said. As reported, Avon has agreed in principle to acquire Giorgio Inc., a Beverly Hills, Calif.-based fragrance maker, for $185 million, and there are plans for other acquisitions soon, he said.    Specifically, Mr. Waldron expressed a strong interest in the Elizabeth Arden line that the Indianapolis pharmaceutical concern Eli Lilly andamp; Co. has said it is selling.    Avon also is looking to acquire more nursing homes and alcohol- and drug-treatment centers, he said.    &quot;Whatever we do, these acquisitions will not significantly increase the leverage on our balance sheet, and the acquisitions we've made will not have any impact on our dividend,&quot; Mr. Waldron said.    No major divestitures are in sight, Mr. Waldron said.    As for a leveraged buyout of Avon, also the subject of speculation, the executive said the company has &quot;no active program in place. . . . On the other hand, I would say as a defensive measure against a raider, companies are of course looking at LBOs.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
