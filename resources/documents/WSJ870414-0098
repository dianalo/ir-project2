Yesterday was the deadline for the U.S. Sentencing Commission to propose the plan, which is intended to reduce the wide disparity in criminal sentences. For some crimes, particularly white collar offenses such as securities fraud and price fixing, the plan also is intended to make it more likely that convicted people will actually spend some time in prison.    But the fate of the proposal is in doubt. Under the law that created the seven-member panel in 1984, the proposed sentencing rules will take effect in six months unless Congress blocks or amends them. Yesterday, congressional aides, who had little time to study the proposal, said the rules must have Justice Department support if they are going to survive congressional review. But Ronald Gainer, a department lawyer who was a non-voting member of the panel, informed the commissioners that he would vote against the plan if he could, suggesting that department support could be in doubt.    Also complicating the plan's prospects is the commission's request to try the rules out for nine months rather than let them take effect. Under the commission's proposal, the new rules officially would take effect in six months. But until August 1988, judges in federal courts would continue following current practices and they would file reports with the commission on what the sentences would be under the new system.    The test period would have to be approved by Congress. Pete Smith, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.), said, &quot;There is some receptivity up here to the idea of a test period.&quot;    But other congressional aides asked why Congress should permit the rules to take effect when the commission is saying, in effect, that it doesn't know what their impact will be and that it needs to experiment with the system for a while. &quot;This really isn't their final submission,&quot; said one House aide.    The commission proposed establishing 43 levels of sentences, from no imprisonment to a life term, and assigning each of hundreds of crimes to a level. Depending on the circumstances of the crime, a judge would be instructed to raise the sentence level by specific amounts.    A first offender convicted of fraud, for example, would receive a level-six sentence, which means as long as six months. But if the amount of the fraud were between $50,000 and $100,000, the judge would have to raise the sentence level to 11, which means eight to 14 months. If the scheme defrauded more than one person, that would add two more sentence levels, making the prison term 12 to 18 months.    For securities fraud, such as insider trading, the base for a first offender would be two to eight months. The sentence level would increase according to the gain of the convicted person. A first offender who gains between $1 million and $2 million from insider trading would serve from two years to 30 months.    Sentence levels would increase for repeat offenders. The same insider-trading offender with two or three prior convictions would probably serve an additional three to six months in jail.    The commission's chairman, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge William Wilkins, said &quot;the number of individuals who will be required to serve some period of incarceration has increased&quot; under the proposed guidelines. This would result in part from stiffer sentences, but it also would reflect that under federal law, parole will be abolished if and when the new sentencing plan takes effect.    Judges would be required to follow the rules whenever they fit a particular crime. But the commission decided in the last few weeks, as it raced through last-minute rewriting of earlier drafts, that it wouldn't attempt to propose rules to cover every situation. Instead, the commission chose to encourage judges to depart from the rules if the facts of a case don't fit a sentencing category. Such departures would have to be explained in writing and would be subject to appeal.    The decision to allow such departures was a principle reason for a lone dissent when the commission finally adopted the plan late Friday by a 6-1 vote. Paul Robinson, a Rutgers University Law School professor, voted against the plan, saying departures from the rules would &quot;invite the very disparity&quot; in sentences that Congress intended to stop.    Under the plan, judges still could use probation for some part of a prison term. But the introduction to the commission's report to Congress said, &quot;Under present sentencing practice, courts sentence to probation an inappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic crimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud and embezzlement . . .&quot;    One major concern in Congress is whether the rules would significantly increase the number of inmates in federal prisons. The law requires the commission to study the impact of the new guidelines on prisons.    Judge Wilkins said yesterday that the commission has statistical information showing that the impact wouldn't be dramatic. But Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D., Wis.), chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, has expressed concern throughout the commission's hearings and drafting periods that it wasn't paying adequate attention to prison impact. </TEXT></DOC>
