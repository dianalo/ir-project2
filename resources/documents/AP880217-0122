In a narrowly drawn opinion, the justices agreed that courts canact on a request that mentally retarded people be sterilized eventhough a state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977.   ``We conclude that our district courts possess subject matterjurisdiction over, and accordingly may hear and determine,applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentallyincapacitated ward,'' the high court said.   A stinging dissent said the court was wandering into a subject``shot through with searching social and ethical questions.''   ``In taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself tothe eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendantsocial and ethical issues,'' said Justice K. David Harris. ``Futurelitigants, faced with unanswered questions of great social andethical dimensions, or with missing ingredients of a vagueapplication process, will continue to press us for determinationswe are singularly unfit to reach.''   But the majority rejected that reasoning.   ``Stated another way, we do not believe our courts lackjurisdiction over a case merely because the case is important orunavoidably includes a constitutional dimension,'' the court said.   The 7-1 decision came in a Polk County case in which Jan andTekla Matejski are the legal guardians of their 33-year-oldmentally retarded daughter, court records said.   The couple filed an application with a lower court seekingauthorization to have their daughter sterilized, but a lawyerappointed by the court to guard the woman's rights objected,claiming there's no provision in Iowa law allowing sterilization.   Polk County Judge Glenn E. Pille agreed and dismissed theapplication.   Both sides appealed, arguing over whether courts have the powerto order sterilization, but going one step further and asking thehigh court to set groundrules.   Lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the Legislaturerepealed a law providing for sterilization of people ``who arementally ill or retarded, syphilitic, habitual criminals, moraldegenerates, or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society.''   But while agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests,the high court refused to spell out guidelines.   ``We are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given theposture of the present case,'' the court said. ``The excursionsuggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisoryopinion.''   Harris said the decision would haunt the justices.   ``At what level of mental retardation can sterilization becompelled?'' Harris asked. ``What board or body, if any, willsuggest statewide standards?</TEXT></DOC>
