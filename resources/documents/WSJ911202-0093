Oracle, Redwood Shores, Calif., and McCaw, Kirkland,Wash., are expected to announce today or tommorrow that theyintend to test the system first in the Seattle area, sayindustry executives familiar with the plan. The system isnovel because it doesn't require new radio frequencies but&quot;piggybacks&quot; on the existing spectrum dedicated to cellularcallers.</LP><TEXT>   The system would mainly compete with traditional telephonesuppliers, whose lines serve as the backbone of many computernetworks. But it also would compete with two other plannedwireless services -- a satellite-based approach sponsored byMotorola Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., andanother wireless system led by BellSouth Corp. and RamBroadcasting Corp.   The Oracle-McCaw system is aimed both at office and mobileworkers who are looking for a more economical way ofreceiving data than over phone lines. The data might includestock quotes, financial reports, airline flight information,newsletters, reference manuals and software programs. Theother two systems are designed mainly for mobile workers withhand-held computers who need to feed and receive data to andfrom their offices and customers.   Booz Allen estimates the annual market for wireless datacould reach $8 billion by the year 2000. Much of the marketwill be consumed by two-way communications. The one-way&quot;broadcast applications will become viable in the mid-1990s,&quot;says Michael McLaughlin, a consultant for Booz Allen inChicago.   Oracle and McCaw wouldn't comment on the plan, butindustry executives say the two companies could launch anationwide system by 1993. Separately, Oracle is seeking toestablish similar broadcast systems in Europe and Asia withthe help of partners from those regions.   Oracle and McCaw are unlikely partners in a bid to createa new U.S. broadcasting medium. However, economic andtechnical changes are forcing a collision between onceseparate industries and creating opportunities for newplayers to distribute electronic information.   McCaw, which has gone deeply into debt in order to carryout its goal of becoming the first truly national cellularcarrier in the U.S., is attracted to the databroadcastingscheme because it offers a means to increase revenue on thecompany's existing network. Craig McCaw, the company's chiefexecutive officer, is openly enthusiastic about the prospectof a new class of electronic devices, dubbed personalcommunicators, that would transmit and receive data viacellular networks. McCaw is believed to be working with AppleComputer Inc., Sony Corp. and IBM on how to blend togetherthe technologies required for such products.   Oracle, meanwhile, sees owning and distributing data as anatural extension of making software tools used in themanagement of computerized information. Two years ago, thecompany established a datapublishing subsidiary led by DickBrass in order to pursue ways of distributing information inelectronic form.   &quot;When we analyzed our competitive position, we didn't seeanyone who could hurt us in databases -- except for thosecompanies who own the data itself,&quot; said Larry Ellison,Oracle's chief executive, in an interview in September.   There have been some previous and notable attempts atbroadcasting data, including one by software maker LotusDevelopment Corp. But those efforts were hamstrung by a lackof capacity, which meant the broadcaster had to dedicate itssystem to a single slice of information, such as stockquotes.   People familiar with the proposed system say it can handlemore data than other systems aimed at the general public,allowing Oracle and McCaw to distribute a smorgasbord ofinformation over the airwaves. This means the service won'tlive or die on the strength of one program, such as stockinformation.   To receive the data, customers would have a special pieceof hardware attached to their computers that would grab&quot;packets&quot; of information from the wireless radio broadcasts.&quot;The receiver has enough intelligence to watch the packets goby and say this one is for me,&quot; says Mr. McLaughlin, theconsultant.</TEXT></DOC>
