Thecity can have all the golf courses it needs by concentrating on developmentswith courses planned as part of their proposals.;    Our Central City Parkarea will have an 18-hole course at a cost of approximately $1 million. Anabundance of water from existing wells near it will take care of its needs.Close proximity to other fields of play would make this an ideal location.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PLENTY OF OPTIONS FOR GOLF COURSES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     Catellus Development Corp. would also satisfy the golf need. An 18-hole,160-acre, $13 million golf course is proposed. The city should look on thisproject with favor since reclaimed water from across the highway from theNUMMI plant would be available. In addition, the proposal's light industry,housing and a fire station would bring jobs to our area.;    The VargasPlateau also includes a golf course along with homes. The hilly area would beideal for those golfers who seek a greater challenge.;    So, we have threeproposed golf courses within a 10-mile radius of Lake Elizabeth. Newark andUnion City are also potential sites.;    Our only concern is the golf coursefor Mission Peak Regional Preserve, which would destroy a sizable portion ofpristine wilderness. The search for water is an issue since existing on-sitewells are not suitable. Taking water from the South Bay Aqueduct is not a goodidea because it would deprive an already restricted Santa Clara County.Reclaimed water with a separate piping system is years and millions of dollarsdown the road.;    There are better alternatives. The city should negotiatewith the developers to make their planned golf courses municipal, thusassuring golfers affordable places to play and protecting the fairways fromconversion to housing.;    -- Margarito A. Alvarez; Fremont;   BUSH'SPERFORMANCE WAS NOT BELIEVABLE; If, as the dictionary says, obscenity issomething &quot;abhorrent to morality or virtue,&quot; then nothing could have been moreobscene than President Bush's performance before the Southern BaptistConvention last week, in which he claimed to have prayed and wept the nightbefore he started Operation Desert Storm .;    Bush's anguish that night ishard to believe in view of the fact that he launched the attack on Iraq aftermonths of unrelenting pressure on Congress, the U.N., and the American peopleto accept war, and after rejecting every opportunity for a peaceful solution.;   As Bush knew it would, the U.S. air war smashed Iraq with the heaviest airbombardment in history, the equivalent of more than five Hiroshima bombs. Itkilled at least 200,000 Iraqis, many of them children, wounded at least350,000, and generated some 3 million refugees. Another 170,000 children areexpected to die this summer from dysentery, cholera, and typhoid, because wedeliberately destroyed Iraq's water purification system.;    Bush has yet toexpress one word of sympathy for these victims. He has repeatedly referred tothe storm of destruction he called down as an episode worthy of national prideand celebration.;    So when Bush conveniently wipes away a tear for thetelevision cameras, I don't believe him. Just as obscenity falsifies andexploits the expression of love, Bush has falsified and exploited theexpression of compassion. He obviously doesn't even know what the word means.;   -- Rachelle Marshall; Stanford;  4-year plan would; make more sense; It's amad, mad world we live in, and some of its maddest moments are when ourgovernor's attempt to balance the budget.;    Why do we endure this lunacy?;   Why can't each governor or president submit a four-year plan which providesfor the basics (government employees' salaries, minimum operating expenses,etc.), allowing our legislators the privilege of battling each year over thefringe benefits if there's a shortfall? The wheels of government could thenkeep churning while the special interest groups duke it out over the remainingfunds.;    What a relief that would be: No more threats of empty payenvelopes, deserted government offices, destitute welfare recipients, and noharried midnight sessions of exhausted legislators! We might even havelegislators that have enough time to learn enough about our other problemsthat they propose meaningful solutions.;    -- Rebecca A.
