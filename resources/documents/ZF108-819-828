(multitasking under OS/2) (tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Hamilton, Douglas A.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>OS/2's threads are designed to solve the problem of runningfunctions in the background without extensive customization byallowing designers to make compute- or I/O-bound activitiesseparately scheduled threads.andP;  Yet, the number of multithreadedOS/2 applications remains relatively small for a number ofreasons: the amount of effort required to build such applications,many of the individuals attempting to build such applications hadlittle practical experience applicable to the task, initialdocumentation for OS/2 left much to be desired, and theirnon-portability.andP;  The future of such applications is cloudy.andO;While things have improved on the technical end, sales of OS/2must increase in order to provide sufficient incentive for thedevelopment of such applications.andP;  As more users and developersbecome aware of the potential of threads, competitive pressureswill increase accordingly.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Operating SystemsTutorialOS-2.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
