Entrepreneurs cite it. Academics quote it. The press often takes it as a given.    They all may be wrong, according to a new study by two researchers from the Small Business Administration and Babson College in Massachusetts.    The researchers, using a new database, tracked over an eight-year period all companies formed between 1976 and 1978 with Dun andamp; Bradstreet Inc. credit ratings and found that only three out of five failed during the first six years. Moreover, they found the failure rate was still lower for companies that grew in employment during their critical formative years -- although they don't know for sure that the growth itself causes survival. Still, for companies that increased their work forces by just one to four people during their first six years, the failure rate was a mere one in three, according to the study. And among companies that added five or more employees, only one out of four didn't make it.    The study also raised doubts about another popular assumption: The relative strengths of the service and manufacturing industries. In the service industry, only 49% of the companies added employees during the eight-year period, while 69% of manufacturing companies showed an increase in employment.    Still, the study hasn't convinced some skeptics. They point out that by only tracking companies that had received Dun andamp; Bradstreet ratings, the study excluded a number of small businesses, such as those which deal only in cash or those which flopped before they ever earned a rating.    Testing Psyches   Of Future Franchisees   IF YOU'RE LOOKING to buy a franchise, be prepared to bare your psyche for a couple of hours.    More and more franchisers are using extensive psychological tests as part of the selection process for new franchisees, consultants say. And entrepreneurs need not apply.    Applicants whose tests turn up strong entrepreneurial qualities, such as creativity and independence, are less likely to be awarded a franchise than those who don't. &quot;The true entrepreneur usually makes a bad franchisee,&quot; says Kenneth Franklin, president of Pittsburgh-based Franchise Developments Inc. &quot;He probably is going to want to do it his way. He is going to want to change the system.&quot;    Mr. Franklin says an increasing number of his clients are using the 2 1/2-hour psychological test his company developed to help ferret out these potential troublemakers. The test leaves no stone unturned. Among other things, it asks applicants about their parents, childhood heroes, favorite movie stars and their least-liked subjects in school. It also asks potential franchisees to draw a person, since people &quot;tend to draw the person they would like to be,&quot; Mr. Franklin says.    Such tests help franchisers pinpoint about the 20% to 30% of applicants who won't make good franchisees, Mr. Franklin says. Those who are offended by the test and refuse to take it usually aren't chosen either. Anybody exhibiting that kind of independence probably wouldn't work well within a franchise system, Mr. Franklin reasons.    Companies Stay Afloat   By Using Credit Cards   ENTREPRENEURS who can't find seed capital or working capital for their small companies through traditional avenues are turning in increasing numbers to a more unusual source: credit cards.    Some small-business executives say they have used their personal MasterCard and Visa charge cards for years as an alternative to hard-to-get bank financing. But they say the practice has become even more widespread in recent months because venture capitalists and banks have slammed the door on most start-up companies since the stock market crash last October.    &quot;It is becoming enormously common,&quot; says June Lavelle, who runs a small-business &quot;incubator&quot; in Chicago, which houses start-up companies. She estimates more than 50% of her 83 tenants now use credit cards to finance their companies. &quot;It is the only kind of credit many of them can get,&quot; she says.    Ann Bergl, who owns Modulus Inc., a housewares importer that is a tenant in the Chicago facility, says she uses as many as eight personal credit cards -- with an aggregate credit line of nearly $25,000 -- to keep her company afloat. When the company collects its receivables, it partially pays her back. She is confident the company eventually will be able to reimburse her in full but concedes, &quot;It will be a while yet.&quot;    How does Ms. Bergl feel about paying interest rates of around 18%-twice the prime rate which banks charge their best customers? &quot;I'd rather do that than fold up,&quot; she says. In fact, Ms. Bergl says she has found credit cards to be a cheaper source of funds than some more traditional lending sources. One finance company she approached wanted to charge her 24% interest.    Odds and Ends   SMALL-BUSINESS optimism is soaring. The National Federation of Independent Business says one-quarter of the companies it surveyed last month plan to increase employment this quarter. Those are the second-strongest hiring plans in the last decade, on a seasonally adjusted basis. And 60% expect increased sales -- the highest level in three years . . . The president's just-released annual report on the State of Small Business in the U.S. will be translated into Japanese and will have a wider circulation in that country than here, says Frank Swain, the Small Business Administration's chief counsel for advocacy. </TEXT></DOC>
