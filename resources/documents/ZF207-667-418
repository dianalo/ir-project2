lawsuits, a less visible development holdsits own promise of significantly influencing the future course of softwarelaw.andP;  I'm referring to a Congressional proposal to split one of the existingfederal appellate circuits in two, something that on the surface would seemnothing more than a dry administrative matter concerning the organization ofthe judiciary.andM;The most obvious effect of such a move would be to create another circuitcourt of appeals.andP;  This is significant, since practically all the legalground rules we currently have for applying intellectual property concepts tocomputer software have been formulated by one or the other of these federaltribunals.andP;  But the creation of a new court of appeals is of particularinterest to the computing industry because the circuit involved is the Ninth,which currently exercises appellate jurisdiction over all federal courts inAlaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon,and Washington.andP;  This vast geographical region is the home base of a sizablechunk of the US computer industry, of course, and it is here, in front of afederal district judge in San Francisco, that Apple Computer's ongoing &quot;lookand feel&quot; suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard is being tried.andP;  Whenand if--emphasize if--the judge's decision comes up for appellate review, itwill be passed upon by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.andM;But the situation is more complex than the above paragraphs suggest.andP;  To seewhy, we have to take a quick look at the way the federal judiciary isstructured.andM;Oddly, the Constitution has very little to say regarding the organization ofthe judicial branch of our government, telling us only: &quot;The judicial Powerof the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in suchinferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.&quot;andO;Earlier in the Constitution, we are advised that when the Senate is trying animpeachment of the President, &quot;the Chief Justice shall preside&quot;--that is theonly mention of such a position in the whole document.andP;  Essentially, that'sall our fundamental governmental blueprint provide us.andM;This leaves everything else--from the number of justices on the Supreme Courtto the number and nomenclature of the &quot;inferior&quot; courts--up to Congress,which can create or abolish federal tribunals as it pleases.andP;  Congress isalso given a free hand to determine the subject matter jurisdiction of thevarious federal courts (including even the Supreme Court, with the exceptionof certain infrequently-encountered instances in which the Constitutiongrants it exclusive jurisdiction).andP;  As a result, virtually our entire federaljudicial system is the creation of Congress.andM;At this point some readers can be excused for wondering how the federaljudiciary ever managed to become the potent force in our government that weknow it to be.andP;  Part of the answer lies in the Constitution's provisions thatfederal judges are to continue in office &quot;during good Behaviour&quot;--which meansfor life--and that their compensation cannot be diminished.andP;  An official whocan't be fired and whose pay can't be cut is likely to display a heck of alot of independence, which is exactly what the Framers intended.andM;A good part of the answer, however, is to be found in the history of England,where a set of principles regarding the things judges could do, or could not,had evolved over the course of several centuries.andP;  These concepts, carriedacross the Atlantic, formed the basis of American notions as to the role ofthe judiciary.andP;  One particular concept--that the judiciary has certaininherent powers--has from the earliest days been read into the Constitutionallanguage that created the judicial branch, and was almost certainly in theminds of the Framers themselves.andM;A perhaps far-fetched example of the application of this doctrine can befound in an old decision that bears the title In re Janitor of the SupremeCourt.andP;  Here, the high court of Wisconsin declared that an attempt by thelegislature to put the court's janitor under the jurisdiction of Wisconsin'scivil service system was an impermissible invasion of the court's inherentpowers.andP;  (No doubt the justices wanted to ensure that they would be thesource of unquestioned authority to command the janitor to shovel more coalinto the furnace on frosty Midwestern mornings.)andP;  But the principle isfrequently applied in more consequential contexts as well, usually withouteven being explicitly mentioned.andP;  Thus, few authorities today would seriouslyquestion the power of the courts to do such things as punish offenders forcontempt, even in the absence of detailed Congressional authorization.andM;When it comes to the organizational structure of the federal courts, though,Congress has pretty much had the whole say.andP;  and while the details have beenchanged a number of times--over the years, the supreme Court has beenallotted as few as six justices and as many as ten, for example--the basicplan of the federal judiciary today does not differ greatly from thatoriginally devised in the Judiciary Act of 1789.andP;  At the top of the structureis the Constitutionally mandated Supreme Court.andP;  As in 1789, the next tier iscomprised of the courts of appeals.andP;  Instead of the original three, however,we now have roughly a dozen.andP;  At the bottom of the pyramid we still have theindividual judges who actually preside over trials--in the federal districtcourts.andP;  (Of course, there are also a number of specialized federaltribunals--the tax court, for instance--that we will ignore in thisdiscussion.)andM;Now we can concentrate our attention on the courts of appeals--referred to inlegal shorthand as CCAs.andP;  These are scattered around the country, and each isresponsible for hearing appeals from the lower courts in a designatedcircuit.andP;  In all instances but one, these circuits cover specificgeographical areas.andP;  The exception is the Federal Circuit, created fairlyrecently by combining the bailiwick of the old Court of Customs and PatentAppeals with that of the former Court of Claims; the Federal CCA considersall appeals from the specialized government agencies within its area ofsubject-matter jurisdiction, wherever they are located.andP;  (This court is ofinterest to the computing industry because it is where you head if the PatentOffice denies your patent application).andM;With one exception, the geographically defined circuits have numbers--theNinth, for example.andP;  The odd one out is the District of Columbia Circuit,whose CCA is kept plenty busy dealing with the large volume of litigationgenerated by the federal government's presence there.andP;  Despite its lack of anumber, this is viewed as an especially prestigious court, and has seenservice by such luminaries as former Chief Justice Warren Burger.andM;Don't get the wrong impression, though--all the CCAs are prestigious, andcourts of appeals judges are extremely powerful individuals in our society.andO;If you'll indulge me, a bit of personal reminiscence may help to illustrate.andM;Late one afternoon, I accompanied a colleague to the 9th CCA's headquartersin San Francisco, where we were seeking to obtain a writ that would preventthe State of California from trying our client on a capital murder charge thenext day.andP;  Then, as now, the court's home was the city's magnificent 1905post office building--one of a handful of buildings that survived theearthquake and fire that devastated San Francisco the following year.andP;  Assoon as you step off the elevator, you realize that they really knew how todesign public buildings in those days.andP;  The duty judge's chambers, allpolished green marble and sparkling chandeliers, looked about the size of abig-city railway station.andP;  I'd never been in chambers before, and I hadn'texpected that the splendor of the room would threaten to distract me from thepurpose of the visit.andM;As it turned out, the judge quickly grasped the merit in our contentions andwas quite willing to sign the document that would bring the state's legalmachinery to a halt.andP;  (There was a lot of gnashing of teeth around the countycourthouse the next morning, let me tell you.)andP;  That business taken care of,the judge obviously sensed our awe at the architectural gem we foundourselves in.andP;  He proceeded to tell us a story about a recent court showdownwith the federal bureaucracy.andP;  At the time, the new San Francisco FederalBuilding--a surpassingly hideous structure that today still looks like thebox some other building came in--was nearing completion.andP;  The CCA judges hadgone over to inspect the new quarters that government designers wereproviding for them, and then, said the judge with a chuckle, &quot;we told themthat we weren't moving&quot;.andM;And they didn't.andP;  Later, after the local district court's business hadexpanded into the premises originally intended to house the CCA, I hadoccasion to be in those chambers.andP;  I could only applaud the appellate judges'disdain.andP;  But the fact that, to my eyes, their esthetic sensibilities werecorrect is not the point.andP;  How many individuals do you know who are powerfulenough to make such a decision--and to make it stick?andM;In short, no one but the Supreme Court overrules the judges of the courts ofappeals.andP;  And that doesn't happen often.andP;  For one thing, the Supreme Courtdoesn't really have time.andP;  As a result, most lawsuits--even thebiggest--never make it past the CCAs.andP;  And that means it is in theseappellate tribunals, rather than in the Supreme Court, that precedent-settingjudicial decisions are generally made.andM;Take software law.andP;  At present, we have exactly two landmark appellatedecisions that deal squarely with the application of copyright laws tosoftware.andP;  The first, Apple vs.andP;  Franklin, established the principle thatsoftware code in general is protected by copyright.andP;  The second, Whelan vs.andO;Jaslow, held that software programs' copyrights may extend beyond literalcode to their structure, sequence, and organization, and so is father to the&quot;look and feel&quot; theory.andP;  Both of these decisions were issued by the 3rd CCAin Philadelphia.andP;  Another decision that provides some aid and comfort to&quot;look and feel&quot; proponents, Atari vs.andP;  North American Philips (a video gamecase), was issued by the 2nd CCA in Chicago.andM;Strangely enough--especially considering the concentration of computingenterprises within its territory--the 9th CCA has sat on the sidelines thusfar.andP;  It was denied its biggest opportunity--a chance to pass on the districtcourt decision in Broderbund vs.andP;  Unison World that appears to carry Whelanone step further--when the parties in that case elected to settle short of anappeal.andP;  As we've observed, though, the Ninth may yet get its turn in theApple/Microsoft/HP litigation.andP;  And the 1st CCA (Boston) also has apotentially juicy one waiting in the wings in the Lotus/Mosaic/PaperbackSoftware free-for-all.andM;But there's a real problem when scattered CCAs are the source of thefundamental ground rules governing a major industry: they don't always agreewith each other.andP;  In theory, when conflicting decisions come out of theCCAs--a &quot;split in the circuits&quot;, lawyers call this--the Supreme Court issupposed to step in to resolve the matter.andP;  The trouble is, it doesn't alwaysdo so.andP;  Sometimes it isn't really obvious that the CCA decisions areessentially contradictory, and sometimes, it appears, the Court simply is toopreoccupied with other matters.andM;This is why the creation of yet another CCA--one that puts the growingcomputing-industry complex of the Puget Sound region into an appellatejurisdiction separate from Silicon Valley's--is an ominous development forthe future course of intellectual property law.andP;  It may well be inevitable,though, since the sheer size of the 9th Circuit's bench--it has 28 judges atpresent, roughly three times the number assigned to the New York-based 2ndCircuit--makes it unwieldy.andP;  It may also be politically irresistible, givenincreasing paranoia in the Northwest over California's &quot;domination&quot; of theregion.andP;  It remains to be seen whether the result will be furthercomplications in intellectual property law as it applies to computing.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
