The suspension won't have any effect on crime ``because the flowof weapons will remain the same if domestic manufacturers fill thevoid,'' she said.   However, the growth of the domestic arsenal promised to take adecline, too, with an announcement by Colt Industries Inc onWednesday that it was voluntarily suspending sales of itsdomestically produced AR15 semiautomatic assault-style rifles.   Colt would not say how many of the weapons it makes.   ``If it is determined by the government review that semiautomaticrifles are not appropriate for the commercial market, we will notsell the AR15 in that market,'' said Colt spokesman Mike Dunn.   Bush administration drug director William J. Bennett welcomedColt's decision as ``an act of civic responsibility.''   On Tuesday, Bennett announced the suspension of pending importpermits for more than 110,000 semiautomatic rifles, referred to as``assault-style'' because they look like machine guns.   The White House stressed Wednesday that there were no plans tocurtail sales of similar rifles produced domestically.   Gwynne Peirson, retired professor of criminology at HowardUniversity and a police officer for 23 years in Oakland, Calif.,said the ban on imports will have no immediate impact, butultimately could if it is made permanent.   ``I think the ban on imports will have a definite positiveeffect, but it will have to trickle down and we may not even see theimpact next year,'' he said.   ``So many of them have been brought in in the recent past, thatthey will still be in the market,'' he said. ``The only thing theban will do in the short run is to increase the price of theavailable weapons.''   Gregg Risch of Handgun Control, one of the country's leading guncontrol advocates, said the organization is ``thrilled'' by theadministration's action, but was even harsher than Peirson in hisassessment of the possible impact on crime, saying simply: ``Zero.''   ``There are a couple of million of them already out on thestreets, gun stores already have large stocks of ones alreadyimported and domestically made ones, and yesterday's action doesn'tdo anything to stop them from selling those,'' Risch said.   ``We're not saying it will have a tremendous effect on crime,''said one Treasury Department official who spoke on condition ofanonymity. ``But in three to four years, we would have 1 million ofthose guns here.''   The Colt AR15, the semiautomatic version of the military's M-16rifle, is the most similar domestically made weapon to those whoseimports have been suspended, such as semiautomatic versions ofAK-47s and Uzi carbines, according to Dick Pedersen of the TreasuryDepartment's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.   The suspension on imports does not affect thousands of othersemiautomatic rifles awaiting import permits, Pedersen said.   ``Hunting rifles that are semiautomatic do not look likeautomatic weapons,'' he said. ``The ones that don't look likeautomatic weapons are still coming in.''   According to estimates by the National Rifle Association and guncontrol activists, there are 60 million to 70 million firearms inprivate hands in the United States, including 20 million to 30million semiautomatic weapons ranging from pistols to theassault-style rifles.   But it is unclear exactly how many semiautomatic rifles,including assault-style weapons, are produced in the United States,Pedersen said.   In 1987, the United States produced a total of 1.76 millionhandguns and 1.01 million rifles, including regular bolt and pumpaction armaments as well as semiautomatics, Pedersen said. That wasa 300,000 jump in both categories _ handguns and rifles _ from theprevious year, and the number was expected to have increased in 1988.   The NRA, which opposes limits on weapons other than machine-gunsthat already are banned, maintains that only cosmetic differencesexist between those whose imports have been suspended and the rest,including weapons ``that have been around for a century.''</TEXT></DOC>
