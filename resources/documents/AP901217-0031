(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There may be a whole lotta shakin' going onif sound waves become the industry standard for processing soybeanoil.   Researchers at the National Center for Agricultural UtilizationResearch devised the use of ultrasound to remove gummy impuritiesfrom the nation's No. 1 vegetable oil.   The technique is faster and more effective than the conventionalmethod of mixing water with crude soy oil so that the sticky gumscan be removed in a centrifuge, said food chemist Timothy Mounts.   ``This would be an avenue to look at - maybe better than themechanical means,'' said David Erickson, director of technicalservices for the American Soybean Association.   When soybeans are crushed to make oil for cooking and saladdressing, processors must remove gummy impurities - fatty acids andphospholipids - that can increase refining losses and createflavors that are slightly off.   Mounts, who developed the system with colleague Karl Moulton,said it has been done only at the government laboratory.   ``We have demonstrated the feasibility of the technology, but wedon't know about the commercial costs,'' said Mounts. ``It shouldbe equivalent to the current process, maybe cheaper on a per-unitbasis because you move the product through the system morerapidly.''   The process uses high-frequency sound waves to vibrate the oiland water mixture at 20,000 times per second, creating tiny bubblesand causing the gums to cluster.   The gums, which bond with hydrogen from the water, then are spunaway from the oil in a centrifuge.   Taste panelists could not tell the difference between soy oilrefined the conventional way and oil processed with the ultrasoundsystem.   Mounts said the technology is available to the soybeanprocessing industry at no cost.   ``There's no patent,'' he said. ``They can do with it what theywill.''</TEXT></DOC>
