Communications Minister Jerzy Slezak did not name the finalists,but said he had proof the review was fair and would provide fulldocumentation to the companies seeking the contract, valued at upto $100 million.   According to U.S. Ambassador Thomas W. Simons, two U.S.companies, two European consortia and a Hong Kong company wereamong the final five.   The contract is the first major government project in Poland tobe put to open bid. It attracted international telecommunicationscompanies and is considered a test of whether the newly capitalisteconomy is ready for sophisticated business dealings with the West.   Cellular telephones are viewed as a quick fix for Poland'sdisastrous telephone system, which is impeding business investment.For the bidders, the contract represents an entry point into theformer East bloc.   The discontent registered by the three American companies wasunderlined by an unusual meeting with journalists held by Simons todiscuss the bidding.   While cautioning that the U.S. government is making no judgmentabout the veracity of the companies' concerns, he said, ``werecognize there are questions'' about fairness.   Communications Ministry specialists invited detailed proposalsfrom eight of 24 companies that made initial offers in February. InSeptember, three U.S. competitors were eliminated: U S West Inc. ofEnglewood, Colorado, Ameritech of Chicago, and Millicom Inc. of NewYork.   From the five finalists - including the U.S. companies Nynex andCrowley - two will be selected by late December for finalnegotiations, Simons said.   The three disqualified U.S. companies are ``seekingclarification'' about why they were eliminated based on a review ofthe technical section of their proposal, said James Whisenand ofAmeritech.   ``All the rejected companies are concerned with is that - win orlose - they have the comfort that the process was pristine andfair,'' he said.   Whisenand would not specify how the companies felt the biddinghad been compromised, but said they seek a reappraisal by theministry.   ``All three companies would hope that the process will beclarified and all eight companies' proposals reviewed,'' he said.   The companies contend that their size and experience make cleartheir ability to meet the technical requirements, Simons said.   Slezak said he was ``astonished'' by the questions.   ``I have materials proving ... the fairness of the process,'' hesaid. ``Each of the firms concerned will receive fulldocumentation.''   The ministry said two of the companies were eliminated becausethey violated an anonymity requirement by disclosing their names inthe technical portion of their bids.</TEXT></DOC>
