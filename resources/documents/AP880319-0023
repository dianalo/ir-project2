Azcona said Friday that 2,000 troops had begun moving into theBocay jungle region on orders to drive out the Sandinistas, addingthat his government was preparing ``an operation to bomb insideHonduran territory.''   He told a news conference he was `counting on the support of theUnited States'' to deter Sandinista aggression. He called thearrival in Honduras Thursday and Friday of more than 3,000 U.S.troops a ``warning'' to Nicaragua.   At the United Nations on Friday, Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistagovernment denied U.S. and Honduran claims that its troops invadedHonduras, where the rebels maintain base camps.   Managua's U.N. envoy accused the Reagan adminstration ofcreating ``an artificial crisis'' in a bid to get Congress torestore military aid to the Contras.   On Thursday, Honduras mounted air raids in the border area whereSandinista troops allegedly penetrated Honduran territory inpursuit of Contra rebels. Azcona said his forces would bombSandinista positions until an estimated 1,000 remaining Nicaraguantroops withdraw.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael O'Brien said Friday evening thatthe United States was considering airlifting Honduran troops tonon-combat areas. In Washington, administration sources said theHonduran request would likely be approved. The sources spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The United States helped Honduras move troops to the border inDecember 1986, after Nicaraguan forces attacked Contra camps inHonduras. No Americans were involved in combat.   The U.S. Embassy said about 800 American paratroopers _ the lastgroup of the 3,200 troops sent to Honduras _ were dropped ontoPalmerola air base Friday morning. The Defense Department said theU.S. troops would be in Central America for about 10 days.   Azcona said he expected the ``simple presence and immediateresponse'' of U.S. troops would scare the Sandinistas intowithdrawing. He repeated what U.S. officials have been saying, thatU.S. troops would not be involved in any fighting.   On Thursday, Honduran warplanes struck at Nicaraguan positionsTegucigalpa says were inside its borders. But Managua says rocketshit inside Nicaragua, near the Sandinista's border militaryencampment at San Andres de Bocay.   Sandinista troops retook San Andres de Bocay from the Contras inan offensive Managua says began March 8 and drove hundreds ofguerrillas into Honduras. Privately, a Sandinista military officialindicated Nicarguan troops had entered Honduras.   A high-ranking Honduran officer, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said about 2,000 soldiers were moving Friday into thearea of hostilities from a base at Juticalpa, about 90 miles westof San Andres de Bocay, and warplanes were on call.   The officer said about half of the original force of 2,000Sandinistas who crossed the border had returned to Nicaragua, whilethe rest penetrated deeper into Honduran territory and were spreadover an area of about 40 square miles.   Another source in Tegucigalpa, who asked not to be identified,said the Sandinistas stopped penetrated deeper into Honduras whenthe United States publicized the incursion earlier this week.   The source said the only activity reported in the region Fridayinvolved Sandinistas he said fired highly flammable whitephosphorus at Contras inside Honduras, estimated at 600 fighters.   The main objective of the Sandinista offensive was to destroy aContra headquarters and a large rebel supply depot in the junglenorth of San Andres de Bocay, the source said, declining to namethe site.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said Thursday that hissoldiers were ready to ``combat and liquidate'' the 82nd Airborneand would continue the anti-Contra offensive in an area fromcentral Nicaragua to the border.   In their 6-year-old insurgency, the Contras have had secretbases in Honduras from which they have attacked Nicaragua.   At the U.N. Security Council meeting Friday, Nicaraguan envoyRita Delia Casco said the United States would be to blame if warbroke out, saying the crisis was ``artificially created by the U.S.adminstration.''   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun said Managua had planned theanti-Contra offensive after Congress denied further aid last month.He denied U.S. forces sent to Honduras constitute a threat or useof force against Nicaragua.   Ambassador Jorge Ramon Hernandez of Honduras said Nicaragua wastrying to derail peace efforts in Central America.   Sandinista-Contra talks set for Monday are now doubtful.</TEXT></DOC>
