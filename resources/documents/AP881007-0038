Rowan says theDistrict of Columbia mayor and other city officials tried to``extort'' favorable newspaper columns by suggesting weaponscharges against Rowan could be dropped.   Rowan claimed Thursday that Mayor Marion Barry and other seniorcity officials had suggested they could influence thehighly-publicized weapons case against him if he stopped denouncingcorruption in city government.   Barry denied the charge.   ``Unfortunately Mr. Rowan made some extreme charges. ...However, I am too disciplined emotionally and have too much dignityto get into a debate with Mr. Rowan,'' Barry said.   On Wednesday the city announced it would not seek to retryRowan, who has called in his column for tougher gun control, oncharges of illegal possession of a handgun and ammunition. Atwo-day trial on the charges last week ended in a hung jury.   During a poolside press conference at his home _ where he hadused the gun last June to wound a teenage intruder _ Rowan said hewas pleased that the city had decided not to try the case again.   He claimed, however, that the entire episode was ``a malicious,political prosecution from day one.''   But Barry countered: ``The fact of the matter is, we have a verystrong gun control law in Washington. If you possess anunregistered handgun, as Mr. Rowan did, it is a case that should bediscussed between the Corporation Counsel, judges and juries, whichis the way this case was handled.''   The columnist alleged Thursday that Herbert O. Reid, one ofBarry's closest advisers, had contacted Rowan's son, Carl Jr.,after the shooting.   ``My son reported to me immediately that Reid had told him thatthe mayor's public posture on the gun issue would improve if Iwould `lower my voice' about corruption in the city,'' Rowan said.   Reid flatly denied the charge Thursday, calling it a ``baldfacedlie.''   Rowan also alleged that Barry _ who had criticized Rowanpublicly for the shooting _ called his son June 28 to say thatCorporation Counsel Frederick D. Cooke, the city's top attorney,could not make a decision to prosecute the case without his input.Cooke refused to comment on the matter.   In addition, Rowan claimed that on July 29, after the chargeshad been filed against him, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., called hiswife at Barry's request and left her a number where Rowan could``call Barry and perhaps get him to drop the charges.''   ``I never called Barry because I feared that he would claim thatI telephoned him trying to `cut a deal,''' Rowan said.   Conyers confirmed making the call, but Julian Epstein, Conyers'spokesman, said the congressman was unaware of any possibleulterior motives by Barry.   Rowan frequently criticizes the district government in hiscolumns.   ``None of us can be proud to live in a city that wallows inincompetence,'' Rowan said. ``You deserve a mayor and other cityofficials whom your children can regard as inspirations to greatachievement. What you have now is venality, ignorance, lack ofcouth, and an absence of conscience at the top.''</TEXT></DOC>
