AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leftist rebels frightened citymayors and election officials into quitting, but a guerrillacommander said Friday they will not attack polling places or peoplewho vote in the presidential election.   The rebels have declared a traffic ban before Sunday's vote,threatening to attack vehicles.   No commercial traffic moved on rural highways, and rebel sabotagekept much of El Salvador without power. At least one van wasattacked with a firebomb, news reports said.   Few buses operated in San Salvador, but army trucks carriedpeople and some pickup trucks took passengers for fares.   ``You can't stop people,'' said a driver named Roberto, who saidhe was charging the normal bus fare of 20 cents. ``I did not comeout yesterday, but I need to work so here I am.''   All three leading candidates have condemned the rebel actions andstressed their efforts to end a 9-year-old civil war that has costmore than 70,000 lives.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said therebels had received large deliveries of AK-47 assault rifles andammunition from Cuba in the past few months. Other officials,speaking privately, said at least some were shipped throughNicaragua.   Redman said the deliveries contradicted guerrilla claims ofinterest in a peace settlement.   Campaigning ended Wednesday by law. In preliminary polling, FidelChavez Mena of President Jose Napoleon Duarte's Christian DemocraticParty trails coffee millionaire Alfredo Cristiani of the rightistRepublican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena.   Guillermo Ungo, a former leader of the rebel political wing, is adistant third for the leftist Democratic Convergence. Four minorcandidates also are running.   The mayors of Chalatenango, the northern provincial capital, andMetapan, a northwestern city, resigned under threats from the rebelFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front. More than half thecountry's municipalities are without mayors, and nine mayors havebeen assassinated.   Election officials in three precincts near the eastern city ofSan Miguel were reported to have resigned. The guerrillas have toldelection officials to quit before Sunday.   A guerrilla commander in northern Cabanas province told TheAssociated Press that no attacks would be made on polling places orcivilians voting on election day, but right-wing squads might attackcivilians disguised as guerrillas.   A member of the guerrilla front's political bureau based inMexico City, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, said: ``We will not directlyattack those who are voting. Those who vote have to have thatguarantee.''   She also said the rebels were urging election officials to quitbut had not threatened to kill them.   Rebel leaders declared the boycott after making an unsuccessfuloffer to participate if the election was postponed until fall andfairness could be guaranteed. Their expressed aim is to discreditthe election and force new negotiations on their proposal.   Polls indicate no candidate will get a majority, which would meana runoff in April, but reliable polling is difficult because manyvoters are afraid to express an honest preference.   Cristiani, the Arena candidate, says he would offer the rebels achoice of laying down their weapons to join the political process orfacing ``the efficient use of the armed forces.''   Duarte's attempts to improve the stagnating economy have beenhampered by the war and, critics say, corruption and mismanagement.He is barred by the constitution from seeking a second five-yearterm.   The Christian Democrats' performance in office has hurt theircandidate Chavez Mena, who promises to negotiate peace withoutpower-sharing arrangements the guerrillas want.   Ungo has dismissed both his opponents with the statement: ``Onedoes not want peace and the other cannot bring it about.''   The government election council said the army would distributevoting materials across the country on Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
