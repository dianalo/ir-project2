Department of DefenseBudgetingInformation Resources ManagementElectronic Data Processing.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Defense IRM Suffers From Shock of $1 Billion JoltandM;Military IRM officials were prepared to lose some ADP funds to the corporateinformation management project, but they were recoiling last week from a $1billion jolt delivered to systems development plans in the new defensebudget.andM;The blow came when the House-Senate defense authorization conference endorseda Senate-backed plan to shift authority over 1991 development money from theindividual services and defense agencies to the Office of the Secretary ofDefense.andM;In addition, Congress sliced the Defense Department's ADP operations andmaintenance budget by half a billion dollars.andM;Many military officials said they were caught off-guard by the loss of almostall their development money.andP;  To date, CIM has focused on just eightadministrative areas.andM;Congress directed OSD to use the CIM plans as the essential yardstick formaking allocations for systems development, whether in the eight areas ornot.andP;  One military official said, &quot;You may as well throw out the rules we'vebeen playing by for the last year or so.andP;  Every system now is either a CIMsystem or it's history.&quot;andM;Some programs took deep cuts.andP;  Almost 90 percent of the Standard ArmyManagement Information Systems program budget fell victim to the shift, saidAnthony Valletta, STAMIS program executive officer.andP;  The program lost about$118 million, he said.andM;Only a small percentage of that money was to be spent for systems in theeight categories of business operations so far targeted by CIM.andM;&quot;This did not meet the original intent of the CIM but went way beyond it,&quot;Valletta said.andM;He noted that even some funding for tactical or battlefield software systems,which have been immune to the CIM plan, was shifted to OSD.andP;  Valletta alsosaid he lost control over all money for staff salaries for the programmanagement operations he supervises.andM;Overall, the Army lost $542 million, the Air Force $427 million and the Navyabout $287 million of their 1991 budget requests to CIM.andP;  To get theirdevelopment money back, the services will have to make requests to CynthiaKendall, DOD's deputy comptroller for IRM, who is the CIM manager.andM;IRM officials in all three uniformed services said they were meeting lastweek to determine how to respond to the new funding method.andP;  But as of earlylast week, Valletta and others said they had not yet received any word fromOSD on procedures for securing funds.andP;  Officials in both the Army and Navysaid they doubted all $1 billion will ever be routed back to them.andM;Attempts to plan were complicated if not altogether stopped by uncertainty,officials said.andP;  &quot;The problem is that we don't know exactly what's coming,&quot;one military official said.andP;  &quot;If OSD tells us to cut 20 percent across theboard, you'll have systems that won't be worth doing at all.andP;  Or maybe [OSD]will tell us which systems have to be killed first, and then give us themoney back for the rest of them.&quot;andM;Another official, citing staffing limitations in Kendall's office, said hewould not be surprised &quot;if OSD just redistributes the money pretty much theway it was requested after slicing off a percentage.andP;  Short of not giving usanything at all, that would be the easiest thing to do.&quot;andM;Congress directed that no specific programs be cut to accommodate the shift,but it required services to justify programs to OSD before receiving funds.andM;Under CIM, Pentagon officials want to eliminate duplicate systems forfunctions such as payroll, personnel and logistics.andP;  The plan was launchedearlier this year in the continuing Defense Management Review.andP;  Teams ofDefense employees knowledgeable about each of the eight areas have beenexamining DOD-wide requirements.andM;The joint panel directed OSD to provide an in-depth report to Congress byMarch on CIM progress.andM;Meanwhile, at least one Navy component won a reprieve on Capitol Hill.andO;During the budget conference, the panel restored funding for the NavalReserve Force's continuing systems modernization plan, known as RESCOMMIS.andM;It is the Navy's attempt to update its reserve automation system and shift itto microcomputers.andP;  Last month, the project fell victim to an attempt by theHouse Appropriations Defense Subcommittee to cut about $6 million from its1991 budget.andP;  A Navy official said the cut would have killed RESCOMMIS.andM;The House subcommittee, citing the Army's progress on the $1 billion ReserveComponent Automation System, said the Navy should be prevented fromdeveloping a duplicate system.andM;But the joint panel apparently veered from its own concerns about duplicativesystems and restored the RESCOMMIS funds pending a review by Kendall inFebruary.andM;On another front, the Air Force Logistics Command received a mixed messagefrom Congress.andP;  Although the joint panel conceded that two upgrades of AFLC'sLogistics Modernization Systems targeted for cuts are CIM candidate systems,the conferees took issue with a House recommendation that AFLC hardwareprocurements continue as planned.andM;Instead, Congress ordered Kendall to report to the two appropriationscommittees before any buys are made for the Depot Maintenance ManagementInformation System, cut by $37 million, or the Requirements Data Bank, cut $3million.andM;The panel took heavy budget swipes at a variety of individual procurementrequests.andP;  Losers in the 1991 funding sweepstakes included $9 million cutfrom the Army's Standard Financial System and $29 million taken from theEngineering Data Management Information and Control System, a Navy andDefense Logistics Agency system.andM;The Air Force's Personnel Concept-III program was stopped entirely pending aCIM group's decision on which existing DOD personnel system should become thestandard.andM;Congress also reduced by $18 million the services' individual procurementbudgets for upgrades to the Worldwide Military Command and Control System.andO;The panel said it backed WWMCCS but the strategic information system&quot;continues to be developed without a coherent management structure.&quot;andM;Congress noted most of the WWMCCS ADP Modernization program funds it cut hadgone unspent because of delays in contracting for new hardware.andM;Congress also cut about $5 million from the overall WWMCCS operations andmaintenance budget, reducing it to about $15 million for 1991.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
