The Soviet subsequent practice from 1972 to date, like that ofthe US from 1972 until 1985, has fully supported the validity of thetraditional interpretation, and explicitly rejected the reinterpretation,both before and after the reinterpretation was announced. The recordis unambiguous. The Reagan administration's continued support of itsradical reinterpretation of the ABM Treaty cannot be justified. In seekingto place the matter in perspective, one could do worse than apply thegolden rule: what would the US have thought if after many years the USSRhad suddenly, unilaterally, reinterpreted the ABM Treaty (or any other)to suit a policy purpose of its own, contrary to US policy and to theoriginal clear understanding of both parties? What would the US havethought if the Soviets had then publicly acknowledged that they had doneso without examining either their own ratification record of the recordof the subsequent practice of the parties, without consulting any butone of their own negotiators, and before compiling much of their ownrelevant negotiating records?</TEXT></DOC>
