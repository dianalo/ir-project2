<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-29-0922 </DOCNO><TEXT>Recent experimental results in tokamaks together with advances in magnettechnology suggest the use of super high fields in large aspect ratiodevices and consideration of superconducting as well as copper magnets.Super high field copper magnet devices would use magnetic fields of 13to 25 T at the plasma axis. Advances in superconducting magnet technologycould provide fields of 8 - 13 T in concepts for super high field ETRdevices and commercial reactors. An effective way to achieve burningplasma conditions may be to use pure ohmic or ohmic dominated heating.The ohmic heating contribution and ntau/sub e/ value projected for ohmicallyheated plasmas by &quot;Neo-Alcator&quot; scaling could both be maximized by designswith the highest possible values of B/sup 2/a (where B is the magnetfield and a is the minor radius). B/sup 2/a is generally maximized byuse of a high aspect ratio, increasing the magnet field at the expenseof minor radius. The use of high aspect ratio facilitates high valuesof magnetic field at the coil since there is more area in the inner legof the TF magnet to keep the stresses and magnet heating at acceptablevalues.</TEXT></DOC>
