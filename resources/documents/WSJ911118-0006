Intel's new supercomputer is the latest generation of asuccessful line of Intel machines that use a technologycalled massively parallel processing, which speeds upcomputing tasks by using many internal &quot;brains,&quot; orprocessors, that break up problems into pieces that areprocessed simultaneously.</LP><TEXT>   Intel said its new computer, called the Paragon XP/S, canbe configured in models ranging from a $2 million machineusing 66 processing &quot;nodes&quot; to a $55 million machine using4,000 nodes. Each node consists of several computer chips,including two of Intel's 860XP microprocessors.   Massively parallel machines, while still a small part ofthe supercomputer market, are rapidly gaining favor becausethey tend to offer more computing power per dollar thanconventional supercomputers. By using off-the-shelf chipssuch as the 860 and standardized Unix operating software inits air-cooled machines, for example, Intel has producedsupercomputers that are a fraction of the cost ofliquid-cooled machines from Cray that use custom-designedprocessors.   Sales of massively parallel machines will grow 60% toabout $270 million this year while Cray's revenue hasremained flat for several years, estimated Gary Smaby,president of Smaby Group, a supercomputer-industry researchfirm. Intel says its supercomputer sales have doubled eachyear since 1989. &quot;Our ambition is to move into the computerroom and push out the dinosaurs,&quot; said Justin Rattner,director of Intel's supercomputer division.   Intel's older supercomputer line comes with up to 128processors and runs at up to 7.6 billion floating-pointoperations per second, or gigaflops, a common speed measure.Early this year Intel installed a prototype machine using 570processors at the California Institute of Technology, amachine that became the basis for the new Paragon machines,which Intel says will run at five to 300 gigaflops.   For scientists, massively parallel machines represent thecutting edge of computer technology. Intel said it has ordersfrom national laboratories such as Argonne and Oak Ridge,which plan to use the machines for such tasks as creatingglobal climate models and figuring out the quirks ofsuperconductivity -- tasks that require number-crunchingpower that many scientists believe can come from massivelyparallel machines.   Other buyers of Intel's new machines include Boeing Co.and Merrill Lynch. Prudential Securities Inc., which has usedIntel supercomputers for several years because they are moreaffordable than Cray machines, will buy one of the new Intelmachines to analyze complex financial instruments thatconventional computers can't handle, said David Audley,director of Prudential's financial-strategies group.   &quot;There's unquestionably a shift toward massively parallelmachines,&quot; especially in the growing market among businessusers who are new to supercomputers. Machines like those fromIntel and rival Thinking Machines Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.,which recently announced a new massively parallel machine ofits own, &quot;offer a price-competitive way into supercomputingwithout the additional cost of a Cray,&quot; he said.   Intel plans to announce its machines at a supercomputerconference in Albuquerque, N.M., where Cray is expected toannounce a new supercomputer of its own tomorrow.</TEXT></DOC>
