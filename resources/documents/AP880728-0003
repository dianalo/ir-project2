Several other Republicans who figure prominently in vicepresidential speculation have not yet received questionnaires fromBush, according to their spokesmen.   Bush, who has about three weeks left to pick a running mate forthe fall campaign, also disclosed plans to testify before theRepublican platform committee when it meets the week before theparty's convention in New Orleans early next month.   Republican sources said a request for background information hadgone out to Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico as well as to Kemp.And New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu said he had received aquestionnaire from Bush campaign officials.   An aide for Kemp said the congressman met with Robert Kimmitt, aWashington attorney who is helping the Bush campaign filterpossible running mates. The aide, Marci Robinson, said the New Yorkcongressman would return the material to the Bush campaign within aweek.   Meanwhile, Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas,lambasted the Republican for opposing the Equal Rights Amendmentand other women's concerns.   ``The Reagan-Bush administration opposes the ERA ... they rippedit out of the (Republican) platform,'' he told the NationalFederation of Business and Professional Women meeting inAlbuquerque, N.M.. He said that despite Bush's call last week fortax credits for day care, the administration fought `'every step ofthe way'' against a $50 million spending proposal with the samegoal.   Dukakis, boosted by his own party's convention, drew his biggestlead of the presidential campaign _ 18 points over Bush _ in thelatest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll.   Dukakis spent his day in Boston, ostensibly tending toMassachusetts statehouse duties but staging a bill-signing ceremonyfor legislation to add about 1,000 beds to state prisons and torestore child pornography legislation that was struck down by thestate Supreme Court.   He also announced distribution of $7.8 million in state andfederal grants to assist the victims of crime, and said his stateis a national leader in ``increasing sensitivity and awareness ofwhat it is like to be a victim of crime.'' Dukakis also cited a 13percent drop in crime in his state in the past four years.   Dukakis' public events during the day seemed designed to counterthe Republican charge that he is soft on crime, particularly inview of his one-time support for a prison furlough program thatpermitted some first-degree murderers to receive passes. One suchprisoner raped a Maryland woman while on furlough.   Dukakis also signed a $124 million spending plan to close thebooks on the fiscal year that ended June 30. The money was largelyfor underfunded entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children.   Aides to Bush, meanwhile, have said he is conducting polling inseveral key states to gauge the impact of several potential runningmates. In addition to Kemp, the names mentioned most frequently inthe speculation include Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole andCalifornia Gov. George Deukmejian. Several women's names also cropup periodically, including Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas andDole's wife, Elizabeth, a former secretary of Transportation.   Aides to Sen. Dole, Deukmejian, former Tennessee Gov. LamarAlexander, Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Sens. Richard Lugar ofIndiana and Alan Simpson of Wyoming all said they had not receivedquestionnaires.   Bush campaign officials declined to say how seriously candidatessuch as Sununu and Domenici were being taken, although there wasspeculation that at least some names were being made public to maskthe true deliberations as well as to give the officials involvedadditional stature in their states.   One man not mentioned in the speculation, Sen. Gordon Humphreyof New Hampshire, held a news conference in Washington to announcean effort designed to pressure Bush into picking a conservativerunning mate.   Humphrey said the Coalition for a Winning Ticket would not be a``stalking horse for any one candidate'' but a ``rallying point forconservatives who hope to persuade the vice president to choosesomeone from the conservative majority wing of the party.''   As for Bush, campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the vicepresident would travel to the convention city of New Orleans onAug. 8 to address the platform committee and ``put his stamp ofapproval on the platform.'' The vice president isn't expected toreturn until Aug. 17, the day he is formally nominated as theparty's candidate for president.   In other developments, the Republican National Committeedisclosed it is conducting a multi-million dollar advertisingcampaign leading up to the convention.   The three, 30-second commercials do not mention Bush by name,but tout ``seven years of jobs, peace and economic growth broughtto you by the Republicans.''   One commercial evokes images of the high inflation and long gaslines of Jimmy Carter's presidency as the announcer says, ``TheRepublicans have worked very hard to make sure you'll never have tosee it again.''   In the latest poll _ a telephone survey of 1,770 registeredvoters conducted Saturday through Monday _ Dukakis received 50percent support to 32 percent for Bush. Dukakis had led by 10points, 46-36, in a pre-convention NBC-Journal poll.   Other recent surveys have found a jump in Dukakis' support,common for presidential nominees following their party conventions.Two Gallup polls done after the convention had Dukakis ahead by 17points, and he led by 10 points in one poll and by 12 in anotherconducted during the convention.   The latest poll found women providing a major component ofDukakis' support, a continuation of the ``gender gap'' suffered byBush. Dukakis led by 30 points among women, 54-24, compared to asix-point lead among men.   The survey had a margin of error of three points.   Among the Democrats, an aide to Jesse Jackson said the runner-upto Dukakis in the primary campaign is ``fired up'' and ready tobegin active campaigning for the party's ticket. A spokesman at theSecret Service said Jackson would continue to receive securityprotection while a decision is made on whether to grant protectionfor the entire fall campaign.   In Chicago, Jackson met briefly Wednesday with DemocraticNational Committee Chairman Paul Kirk to discuss Jackson's role inthe campaign, but neither side would give details.   ``It's part of a series of meetings to ensure ongoingcommunication with all parts of the party and to make certaineveryone gets involved,'' committee spokeswoman Julie Anbender saidin Washington.   Also Wednesday, Bush told a group of young inventors ``thiselection is really about you,'' saying they and other young peoplehold the key to the 21st century.   ``Education is the engine that drives our inventive spirit,''the vice president said, reiterating his frequently sounded themethat he wants to be the ``education president.''</TEXT></DOC>
