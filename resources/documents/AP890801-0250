The Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer ofthe economy's direction, plunged to 46 percent in July from 48.8percent in June, the third straight monthly decline.   That makes the level of last month was the lowest since January1983, the early days of what has become the country's longestpeacetime expansion. The January 1983 reading also was 46 percent.   The news from the purchasing agents comes at a time wheneconomic vital signs are under intense scrutiny in the businessworld because of questions about whether the economy has enoughstrength to continue growing.   Most analysts think the economy needs the stimulation of lowerinterest rates to avert a general recession. Some sectors of theeconomy already seem to be sinking into deep declines, analysts say.   ``I think the index is pointing very ominously toward seriousproblems for the economy right now,'' said David Resler, chiefeconomist at Nomura Securities International. ``It looks to me likethe odds of recession are going up every day.''   Allen Sinai, economist at the Boston Co., said the report onbusiness by the National Association of Purchasing Managementunderscored the weakened state of the economy's industrial base.   ``The industrial side of the economy is weak, flirting withrecession,'' said Sinai. ``Parts of the economy and some regions ofthe country do appear to be in or near a recession.''   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has said thecentral bank's chief mission now is to prevent the economy fromsliding into a harmful recession. With that aim in mind, the Fedhas loosened its hold on credit.   Many commercial banks on Monday reduced their prime lendingrates to 10{ percent from 11 percent. The cut in the benchmark rateis expected to reduce borrowing expenses for businesses andconsumers and encourage spending.   Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchasing group's businesssurvey committee, said members representing manufacturers incertain industries such as automobiles and consumer durable goodsare pessimistic about the next several months because they knowlower interest rates don't immediately change behavior.   There typically is a lag of several months before lower creditcosts start to encourage increases in spending.   Bretz said a reading in the purchasing agents' index below 50percent indicates that the manufacturing sector of the economy isin decline while a reading above 50 percent indicates growth.   But he said the index would have to fall below 44 percent inorder to suggest an overall decline in economic activity _ meaningthat the inflation-adjusted gross national product, the value ofall goods and services produced, was contracting rather thanexpanding.   The monthly report contained what private economists called somefairly upbeat news on inflation and trade.   The price index declined to 46.9 percent in July from 48.5percent in June and reached the lowest level since April 1986, whenit was 42.8 percent.   Exports were the strongest element of the economy as slightlymore members of the association reported that they were exportingin July.   Here are some details from the report:   _Manufacturing production fell in July, snapping a string of 35straight months of expansion. The index of manufacturing outputfell to 48.3 percent from 52.4 percent in June and was the lowestsince a reading of 48.2 percent in July 1985.   _New orders declined in July for the second consecutive month.The new orders index fell to 44.8 percent from 47.2 percent inJune. Last month's reading was the lowest since 41.5 percent inNovember 1982, when the last economic recession was bottoming out.   _Employment dropped for the sixth straight month, reflectingmanufacturer reluctance to hire in the face of a slowing economy.The employment index fell to 44.4 percent in July from 47.4 percentin June.   _Inventories fell for a seventh straight month in July, down to45.5 percent from 49.7 percent.   _The pace of vendor deliveries quickened in July, with the indexat 46.9 percent vs. 47.5 percent, indicating fewer commodities werein short supply.   The association's monthly report is based on replies toquestions asked of purchasing executives in more than 250industrial companies. The purchasing managers' index is a compositeof five separate indicators, including new orders, production,vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.</TEXT></DOC>
