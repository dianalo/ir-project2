The trend could make the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries ``less relevant, at least in its ability to fixcrude oil prices,'' said the study, conducted by Gulf InternationalBank.   The study contended that integrated producers will focus more onthe prices of refined products rather than crude.   ``As the countries with large excess capacity make more inroadsinto global ... integration, they will find their interestsdiverging from the rest of OPEC and more in common with the majoroil companies,'' said the study by the Bahrain-based bank.   For example, last year Saudi Arabia signed a 50 percentpartnership deal with U.S. oil giant Texaco Inc. that covers threerefineries and 11,450 retail stations in 23 states. The ventureguarantees an outlet for an estimated 615,000 barrels per day ofSaudi crude, the study said.   Kuwait, a pioneer in spreading out to downstream ventures, isguaranteed some 250,000 barrels per day through refineries andretail stations it purchased outright in the United States andNorthern Europe.   The study also said that Abu Dhabi has embarked on a similarpath with its acquisition of a 10 percent stake in Spain's largestprivate oil refiner, Cia Espanola de Petroleos (CEPSA), and a 10percent stake in the French company Total.   Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are members ofthe 6-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, along with Bahrain, Qatarand Oman. The study predicted the latter three would follow adifferent pattern by linking up with local oil producers.   The study cited reports that these countries were pushing formore involvement _ either through joint ventures or directpurchases _ in America, Europe and Asia.   Gulf oil and refining strategies will be discussed at a GCC oilministers meeting scheduled for Nov. 19 in Abu Dhabi. The followingday, the ministers will be joined by the rest of the members of the11-nation Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, whichhas long sought to integrate Arab oil operations.</TEXT></DOC>
