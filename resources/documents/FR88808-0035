In addition, a minor change would be made to existingregulations that reference dates for an open bait season on that portionof the Naknek River within the park; the purpose being to remain consistentwith changing State regulations. These proposed regulations are necessaryto continue safely accommodating use of the popular Brooks River fisheryby anglers, while maintaining a healthy fishery for bear populations whichfeed there. Current bag limits of 5 salmon and 2 trout_the two speciesfor which the river is popular_encourage many anglers to keep fish in theirimmediate possession or in the nearby area while seeking to fill thesecatch limits. By providing less opportunity for anglers to retain largebag limits of fish in the area, there will be less chance of bear/humanconflicts caused by bears associating humans with food. The effect of theseproposed regulations will be to reduce the potential for conflicts betweenbears and humans in the area, while protecting the natural fish resourcesavailable to bears along the Brooks River. This is a primary goal of parkmanagement, as stated in the park's General Management Plan (GMP).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments will be accepted through October 7, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be addressed to: Superintendent, KatmaiNational Park and Preserve, P.O.

Itis not proposed as a result of any known depletion in fish populationsor fisheries habitat impairment. It also corrects a conflict between Stateand Federal laws and regulations regarding bait fishing along those portionsof the Naknek River within the park. In the summer of 1987 the National Park Service submitted a proposal tothe State Board of Fisheries for a change in the State fishing regulations.Current State regulations affecting the Brooks River fishery allow fora bag and possession limit of 5 salmon and 2 rainbow trout during the summerfishing season. The National Park Service proposal had the same objectivesas this proposed rulemaking, but differed by being applicable to all riverswithin the park and preserve, and by changing bag limits for salmon onlyto two instead of the current proposal of one. Changes were not proposedto bag limits for any other species of fish. It also did not address changesto bait fishing regulations for the Naknek River. The Board failed to approvethis proposal, based in part on a determination from the Alaska Departmentof Fish and Game that the fishery was healthy and that the proposed actionaddressed other management considerations not in the purview of the Board.The Board also expressed concern about the large area covered by the proposaland some confusion about the objectives. It was recognized by the Departmentof Fish and Game at the Board meeting that the National Park Service hadthe authority to promulgate regulations to address the problem:<ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, this is a proposal put in by the park service that encompassesa fairly large chunk of real estate * * * most of which has fairly limitedangling pressure. Salmon stocks, particularly in the Naknek drainage, appearto be healthy and staff (Department of Fish and Game) see no biologicalreason to further limit the sport bag limits there. They're presently fivea day, five in possession in much of that area. The park service has theauthority to do this if they need to * * * (transcript from taped proceedingsof State Fish Board meeting, December 17, 1987; Anchorage, Alaska).</ITAG>Consequently, the bag limit provision of this proposed rulemaking is amodified version of the earlier submission to the State and is specificto the Brooks River. The Brooks River and its surrounding aquatic resources are major habitatsfor a diversity of fish and wildlife species. Rainbow trout and salmonare the most abundant fish species in Brooks River. Arctic grayling andArctic char, as well as other species, are also present. This source ofhigh-protein food is of critical importance to bear populations duringtheir short feeding season before hibernation.Because of this diverse ecosystem, the Brooks River is well-known and popularamong both park anglers and visitors interested in being able to view theAlaska brown bear in its natural habitat. Park managers in Katmai havealways been conscious of and concerned about the management of this importantarea. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA_Pub.L. 96-487), which added further acreage to the area, mandated that thenew park is ``to be managed for the following purposes, among others: Toprotect habitats for, and populations of, fish and wildlife including ** * high concentrations of brown/grizzly bears * * * and * * * to maintainunimpaired the water habitat for significant salmon populations * * * .''(section 202(2) of ANILCA; 16 U.S.C. 410hh-1(2)). Congress also determined that Katmai should be managed to protect ``recreationalfeatures''. Sport fishing is permitted within national park areas in Alaska(section 1314 of ANILCA; 16 U.S.C. 3202; 36 CFR 2.3, 13.21). Providingfor the use of the Brooks River by recreational anglers and natural predatoractivities of the area's brown bears pose both a resource management problemaffecting the bears and a safety concern for humans. The General Management Plan (GMP) for the park, prepared pursuant to section1301 of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 3191), addresses specific management responsibilitiesand objectives regarding Brooks River. The plan notes that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Visitors have traditionally come to the Brooks Camp developed areato fish, visit the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, and watch Alaska brownbears in their natural environment. This development and the associatedactivities intrude on prime bear habitat. The result has been potentiallydangerous conflicts between bears and humans in this area. The issue ishow to reduce this hazardous situation and potential impacts on bears whilestill providing for visitor activities in this portion of the park.</ITAG>The objectives of the bear management plan for Katmai, as stated in theGMP,<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * are to retain a naturally regulated population of brown bearsin the park and to preclude the food-reinforced attraction of bears topeople and thereby minimize confrontations between bears and people. Theplan calls for * * * minimizing human impacts on bear behavior and patternsof habitat use * * *.''</ITAG>With the Brooks River being such an important habitat for bear populationsand the nearby Brooks Camp being the major overnight visitor use area inthe park, these objectives are of specific and immediate importance tothis area. Sport fishing along the Brooks River, as well as elsewhere within the park,is regulated by appropriate National Park Service regulations in 36 CFR2.3, 13.21, 13.66 and by applicable State of Alaska fishing regulations.Current State regulations affecting the Brooks River fishery allow fora bag and possession limit of 5 salmon and 2 rainbow trout during the summerfishing season. Park policy requires that any fish kept is to be immediatelytaken to a nearby fish cleaning house away from the river to be cleanedand stored. This policy reduces the chance of bears obtaining fish caughtby people, thereby learning to associate the easy acquisition of fish withhuman fishermen and disrupting the bears' natural feeding cycle. However, an increasing number of anglers, some who travel into the BrooksRiver area specifically to fish for the maximum legal limit, often do nottake their fish directly to the cleaning house, and instead cache fishthey have caught along the shore_a practice that cannot be prevented byany but the most aggressive and costly of law enforcement measures. Bearsare then attracted to this food source, encouraging dangerous bear/humaninteractions. This proposed rulemaking would amend section 36 CFR 13.66, which is specificto Katmai National Park and Preserve, by establishing a total daily baglimit of one fish, regardless of species, on the Brooks River. A minoramendment to 36 CFR 13.66(b)(1) would also be made to remove the datesduring which bait fishing is allowed along the Naknek River to conformwith changing State regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effects of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>These changes will have the effect of eliminating the opportunity for anglersto store their catch along the river banks, which tempts bears to feedon the fish, and will help to maintain a healthy fishery for the bears.The immediate effect will be to cause those anglers who fish the BrooksRiver mainly to acquire food to procure their fish elsewhere. Numerousother areas rich in fish resources are available in the nearby vicinityfor these anglers. Sport fishing for enjoyment will not be restricted,and one fish, regardless of species, can still be retained if desired.Human safety and the protection of natural bear populations, both in theshort and long term, should be greatly improved. Long term effects willbe a continued healthy fishery resource, a lessening of the chances forbear/human confrontations, and an improvement in the natural feeding habitatfor bears. By removing the dates from the National Park Service regulationfor bait fishing the Naknek River bait fishing season will conform withany changes in State law for bait fishing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Options Considered  </ITAG>Other management options based on stated management objectives in the GMPwere also considered in development of this proposed rulemaking. Theseoptions include closing all or portions of the area to human use, restrictingthe Brooks River to catch-and-release angling only, or eliminating anglingalong the river during certain time periods or seasons. The current proposedrulemaking is in accordance with stated overall management objectives andis less restrictive than other options.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation </ITAG>The policy of the National Park Service is, whenever practicable, to affordthe public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly,interested persons may submit written comments regarding this proposedrule to the address noted at the beginning of this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The primary author of these regulations is Tony Sisto, Park Ranger, AlaskaRegional Office, National Park Service, Anchorage. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements thatrequire approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With Other Laws  </ITAG>The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 (February 19, 1981), 46 FR 13193,and certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effecton a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The economic effects of this rulemaking are local innature and negligible in scope. No person will be prohibited from fishingon the Brooks River under applicable regulations. The National Park Service has determined that this rulemaking will nothave a significant effect on the quality of the human environment, health,and safety because it is not expected to: (a) Change public angling habits to the extent of adversely affecting theaquatic or other natural ecosystem; (b) Introduce noncompatible uses which might compromise the nature andcharacteristics of the area, or cause physical damage to it; (c) Conflict with adjacent ownerships or land uses; or (d) Cause a nuisance to adjacent owners or occupants. Based on this determination, this proposed rulemaking is categoricallyexcluded from the procedural requirements of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) by Departmental regulations in 516 DM 6 (49 FR 21438).As such, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental ImpactStatement has been prepared. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 13 </ITAG>National parks, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 13_[AMENDED] </ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, it is proposed to amend 36 CFR Chapter1 as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_National Park System Units in Alaska </ITAG>1.
