But a few points need clarification.    The story implies that the committee recommends &quot;banning&quot; three pesticides in order to eliminate the majority of oncogenic risk from insecticides and herbicides. In fact the committee does not recommend any regulatory action against any pesticide. It made every effort to explain the appropriate interpretation of the worst-case risk estimates contained within the report. The report contains no estimates of actual risk, but rather utilizes worst-case estimates to help the Environmental Protection Agency identify priorities, and to analyze the relative public health and agricultural impact of four regulatory scenarios. Before determining any regulatory course of action on a pesticide, the EPA must perform a far more detailed and sophisticated analysis of each pesticide, comparing both the risks and benefits of that pesticide and its alternatives.    The findings of the committee report deserve greater attention than arguments over risks from individual pesticides and foods. This report contains fundamental insights into the paradoxical realities of the Delaney clause, which mandates a burdensome double standard for the EPA that ultimately would provide producers and consumers with fewer benefits than the uniform negligible-risk standard recommended by the committee.
