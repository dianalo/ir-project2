STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The West German dispute with the Bushadministration over short-range nuclear weapons has ended decadesof German acquiescence over NATO strategic policy and severelystrained relations with the United States.   The West German call for prompt superpower talks on the missilescame just weeks before the upcoming North Atlantic TreatyOrganization summit in Brussels. NATO officials had hoped the May29-30 meeting would be a show of unity as the alliance celebratesits 40th anniversary.   But the unprecedented West German drive for the talks put NATOon notice that this front-line nation intends to take a greaterrole in determining future alliance policy.   Several European NATO allies expressed support for the WestGerman position on the talks, deepening the rift.   ``The age of West German timidity is ending,'' Peter Danylow, adomestic and foreign policy expert with the Bonn-based ForeignAffairs Institute, told The Associated Press.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government is also resistinga joint U.S.-British effort to replace NATO's aging short-rangemissile arsenal in the 1990s with modernized rockets of more thantriple the current range.   The issue is sensitive because most of the weapons are deployedin West Germany and would fall on German soil in the event of war.   The United States and Britain oppose early talks on the weapons,saying the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional forces mustfirst be reduced.   Kohl, and his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, maintainthat their nation's legitimate interests must be taken seriously.   Genscher, architect of the current West German missile policy,has long advocated that the West take every opportunity to improverelations with the Soviet bloc.   But West German resolve on the missile matter is new.   ``The current missile dispute has made it clear that WestGermany must be seriously reckoned with on alliance decisions thatdirectly affect German interests,'' said Heinz Timmermann, aresearcher at the Cologne-based Institute for Eastern European andInternational Studies.   Timmermann said Bush administration sluggishness in formulatinga foreign policy response to Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's disarmament initiatives fueled Bonn's decision to pressfor the talks.   ``I think many in the government perceived that Washington wasnot moving quickly enough and letting Moscow steal the tune,''Timmermann told the AP.   The recent West German decision to press for talks on theweapons came while the popularity of Kohl's coalition governmentwas at an all-time low, with West Germans becoming increasinglyimpatient for the West to respond to Gorbachev's initiatives.   ``The political pressure to take the missile stand at the timewas certainly enormous,'' Timmermann said.   After Kohl's Christian Democrats were buffeted by seriousregional election setbacks, the chancellor reshuffled his cabinetand engineered a coalition consensus on the rockets issue in linewith the growing public mood for progress in arms control efforts.   Public opinion polls indicate Bonn's current course is supportedby the majority of West Germans, who have become increasinglydefiant about heavy defense burdens put on the country by thealliance.   Michael Stuermer, a former Kohl speechwriter and historian nowwith the Foundation for Political Science in Ebenhausen, said a1987 superpower agreement to eliminate intermediate-range nuclearmissiles fueled public demands for new disarmament initiatives.   ``The chain of arms escalation was broken,'' Stuermer said,referring to the treaty.   ``The new dynamic in East-West relations has triggered an urgentdomestic policy issue at home,'' Stuermer said.   Shortly before the start of the summit, West Germany, Britainand the United States were still divided over the most contentiousissue, when to start East-West talks on reducing the short-rangemissiles.   In Washington on Thursday, State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler said: ``Discussions are continuing. There remains a gap tobe bridged.'' She added that ``we have received a response today(from West Germany) and the gap remains.''   Earlier, in an editorial, the respected Die Zeit weeklynewspaper, had admonished the West German government not to backdown too soon.   ``Better an anniversary fight than a weak compromise,'' said theindependent Die Zeit.</TEXT></DOC>
