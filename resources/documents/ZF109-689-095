(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>USVideo Inc.andM;VGA VIDEOGRAPHICSandM;Although the VGA Videographics adapter is in the running among this reviewset, it has some catching up to do.andM;The board is costly for the amount of memory that comes standard.andM;Although USVideo does not supply the board with 512K bytes of memory, theboard can easily be upgraded to that capacity with standard memory chips.andM;At the DOS prompt, the board's performance proved slower than most recentSuper VGA products, but it compensated with very good Windows 3.0performance.andM;Moreover, it's quite flexible, adaptable to virtually any standard PCmonitor.andP;  It will work with a CGA monitor today, yet fully supporthigh-resolution multiscanning displays when the host system is upgraded.andM;The foundation of the USVideo adapter is the ZyMOS POACH VGA chip, mounted ona 9.25-inch-long, 16-bit expansion board with switch-selectable auto-sensingfor bus width.andP;  One bank of 256K bytes in the form of eight 80-ns,4K-bit-by-64K-bit RAM chips is soldered to the basic board.andP;  A second bank ofeight sockets holds the optional 256K-byte expansion, permitting a maximumboard capacity of 512K bytes.andM;Two monitor connectors are provided on the card-retaining bracket -- one9-pin and one 15-pin, high-density connector -- with a DIP-switch bankbetween them for selecting monitor type and default emulation mode from amongCGA, EGA, VGA, monochrome text and Hercules graphics.andM;With 512K bytes and an appropriate monitor (multiscanning or IBM8514/A-compatible), the VGA Videographics board supports as much as1,024-by-768-pixel resolution (interlaced only) in 16 colors; 256 colors at800 by 600 pixels.andP;  In text mode, as many as 132 columns of 60 rows can bedisplayed.andP;  Drivers are supplied for AutoCAD, Framework, GEM, Lotus 1-2-3,Symphony, Windows/286 and Windows/386, Ventura Publisher and WordPerfect.andM;The beta version of the Windows 3.0 driver supplied with the VGAVideographics card proved workable but unsatisfying.andP;  Its 800-by-600-pixelmode offered a maximum spectrum of only 16 colors, despite the 256-colorcapability of the 512K-byte board.andM;Moreover, it yielded an odd, square display with pronounced distortion of thescreen-aspect ratio.andP;  It also used the standard VGA fonts, resulting in tinyon-screen characters.andM;This driver was also installed oddly.andP;  Installation required overwriting thestandard Microsoft VGA driver with one provided by USVideo.andM;The only instructions offered for installation were in the README fileprovided on the software disk.andP;  For more experienced users, the quickinstallation procedure should be no problem.andP;  The less skilled might find ittroubling.andM;The USVideo VGA Videographics board has all the prerequisites for deliveringjourneyman high-resolution displays.andP;  The hardware is made well and workswell, albeit slowly.andP;  If its software quality catches up with its hardwareperformance, it should prove to be an acceptable product for those who needmonitor versatility more than performance.andM;----------USVideo Inc.andM;Stamford, Conn.andP;  (203) 964-9000andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1983andM;Number of employees: 17andM;Gross annual revenue: Not disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings: Not disclosedandM;Source: Computer Directory on CompuServe.andM;Editor's Note: When PC Week Labs received CompuAdd Corp.'s HiRez VGA adapter,the Windows 3.0 driver was missing.andP;  After repeated calls, CompuAdd sent thedriver, but it was received too late to include the product in this review.andM;PC Week Labs inadvertently omitted the Viewpoint VGA adapter, from EverexSystems Inc., of Fremont, Calif.; the Extended VGA Card, from Micro Express,of Santa Ana, Calif.; and the Magnavox 9AV800 Super VGA Display Adapter, fromPhilips Consumer Electronics Co., of Knoxville, Tenn., from this review.andM;PC Week Labs evaluated each of the six reviewed VGA adapters by installingthem in a Dell Computer Corp.andP;  425e, a 25MHz 486-based Extended IndustryStandard Architecture computer, connected to an NEC Technologies Inc.andO;MultiSync 4D monitor.andM;Their performance was tested running Windows 3.0 at 800-by-600-pixelresolution using the software drivers supplied by the manufacturer.andM;Windows 3.0 performance was evaluated by running PC Week Labs' Windowsbenchmarks.andP;  Individual performance results in six categories -- BitBLT, areafill, line drawing, fonts, dialog boxes and clipping -- were scored as apercentage of the speed of the slowest board, and these scores were totaledto achieve a single final value.andP;  This score provides a good representationof the relative overall Windows 3.0 performance of each product.andP;  (Seebenchmark chart, Page 102.)andM;Operation at the DOS level and direct-memory transfers were tested using PCWeek Labs' video-performance benchmarks.andP;  Overall text and graphics speed wasevaluated by running PC Week Labs' own benchmarks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
