His study, ``Trade Deficits and Labor Unions,'' was done for theEconomic Policy Institute. The group is financed by labor unions,foundations and corporations.   Unions bargain for higher wages and better working conditionsthat raise the costs of production. Higher production costs raisethe prices of products and make them less competitive with productsfrom other countries. But Karier argues that Japan, Canada and whatused to be West Germany - which together account for most of theU.S. trade deficit - are already high-wage countries.   But Fariborz Ghadar, professor of business administration atGeorge Washington University, found Karier's reasoning too simple.Competitiveness has to be judged over time and industry byindustry, he said in an interview.   ``The fact is, the industries where the United States is mostcompetitive - biotechnology, aircraft, computers - are the leastunionized,'' he said. ``If I were doing a study, I would start fromthere and try to find the relationships.''   At the Brookings Institution, Senior Fellow Robert Z. Lawrencealso suggested that the approach to competitiveness should bebroader, taking into account standards of living.   Labor union strength in the United States has declined in recentyears. Karier estimates that 18 percent of the U.S. workforce wasunionized in 1985.   The economist compared the United States in this regard with 13of its leading competitors. Only Hong Kong with 15 percent andSouth Korea with 10 percent had lower unionization, according tofigures Karier quoted from the CIA in its World Fact Book for 1987.   Japan, which usually has the biggest surplus in trade with theUnited States, was quoted as 30 percent unionized, while WestGermany was 34 percent and Canada was 31 percent. But Taiwan,another big competitor of the United States, was at the same level,18 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
