However, most significant at the show was theconvergence of some key technologies that we believe will change the rolesdesktop computers will play in the computing industry--and in our lives:andM;* The introduction of the first multiprocessing, bus-master machines targetedat network server-based applications.andM;* The emergence of the first competitive 386SX-based desktop machines,portables and laptops.andM;* The debut of a number of interesting low-end, high-resolution or colorlaser printers.andM;* The availability of inexpensive, high-resolution graphics cards.andM;The following sections will cover the salient developments in each of thesetechnologies in turn.andM;Bus warsandM;EISA hits the pavement running.andP;  Hewlett-Packard was first out of thestarting gate with a '486-based machine for server-based and othercompute-intensive applications (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  3, p. 66).andP;  Other companiesquickly followed suit with their own '486 introductions, either at or beforeComdex.andP;  These firms included Compaq, Everex, Dell, AST, Tandon, AMI andMylex (both of which make motherboards for a number of clone manufacturers),and a bevy of Asian clone makers.andM;Each of these machines boasts impressive performance characteristics; Everex,for example, claimed that its under-$10,000 Step 486is machine outperformsSun's SparcStation 1 &quot;by a substantial margin.&quot;andP;  It clocks in at 26,000Dhrystones, compared with 20,000 for the SparcStation 1.andM;Moreover, a number of them employed an EISA bus architecture, which makessense given that EISA is the 32-bit bus extension to the venerable 16-bit ATbus.andP;  We were impressed that Compaq, AST, Tandon and the other EISA machinevendors showed such unabashed support for EISA right out of the gate.andP;  At thesame time, a number of add-in board manufacturers also showed prototypes ofEISA-compatible expansion boards or announced their intention to providethem.andM;MCA strikes back.andP;  Supporters of IBM's MCA architecture were also heard fromat the show, with an assortment of bus master products being introduced.andP;  Forexample, AOX announced the $4,700, 25-MHz '486 MicroMaster card, whichassumes th role of the host processor, freeing up the machine's on-boardprocessor for I/O processing when appropriate multiprocessing software isemployed.andM;IBM itself introduced a $7,000 i860 RISC processor-equipped bus master card,the PS/2 Wizard Adapter.andP;  We first reported on this board as a &quot;technologydemo&quot; in our coverage of Comdex/Spring, but apparently enough people believedin it to convince IBM to turn it into a shippable product.andP;  The Wizard isbeing billed as a general-purpose coprocessor, but versions of it weredriving a Pixar RenderMan demo, a NASA simulation and several othercompute-intensive applications that underscored the tremendous power it canbring to the desktop.andM;There was no clear winner between EISA and MCA in terms of products shown orsupport announced.andP;  Most chip foundries, such as Chips andamp; Technologies, haveannounced support chips for both architectures.andP;  We expect many third-partyboard manufacturers to follow suit.andP;  Indeed, one of the most innovative boarddesigns we saw at the show was ATI's 8514/Ultra graphics board, which had anMCA-bus edge connector on one side and an AT-bus connector on the other.andP;  Tomove it from one machine to the next you simply remove it, flip it, move thevideo connector to the opposite end, and plug it in.andM;In the end, the choice of bus may be less important than the implications ofan increasing availability of fast, 32-bit bus-master coprocessor boards formachines of both flavors.andP;  As George Conrades of IBM noted in his keynotepresentation, &quot;In my view, the debate is over.andP;  Channel architecture on thedesktop is here to stay.&quot;andP;  We agree.andP;  The Next Computer has shown theindustry that a multichannel processing architecture can be used effectivelyto pack mainframe-style functionality into a relatively low-cost desktopsystem.andP;  The debate over which architecture is superior will continue,largely for marketing reaons.andP;  (We've summarized the strengths and weaknessesof both in an accompanying box.)andP;  But don't let the resulting FUD* discourageyou from buying one or the other.andP;  It appears that there will be plenty ofsupport for both of them in the '90s.andM;Compaq takes on DECandM;The product that best exemplified the joining of the 32-bit processing andbus technologies wasn't a '486 product at all.andP;  A week before Comdex, Compaqlaunched the '386-based Systempro PC system in conjunction with version 2.0of Microsoft's LAN Manager, which was co-developed with Compaq to include32-bit features that would take full advantage of the Systempro'sarchitecture.andM;The Systempro was designed from the word &quot;go&quot; to address the needs ofmultiuser and networking technology.andP;  It can take advantage of either two'386 processors or two '486 processors, uses the 32-bit EISA bus forperipherals, and delivers between 8 and 40 MIPS of computing power, dependingon its configuration.andM;The Compaq Systempro is initially available in three models, each shippedwith one 33-MHz '386 processor, 4 MB of 32-bit RAM, eleven expansion slots(including four for the system processor/memory boards and seven availableEISA slots), a 1.2-MB floppy, and an 840-, 420- or 240-MB fixed disk drivearray with the EISA 32-bit Intelligent Drive Array Controller.andP;  Retail pricesfor these configurations will range from $16,000 to $26,000.andM;Drive arrays.andP;  Aside from multiprocessing, the technology that provides theSystempro with much of its throughput is parallel drive array technology,which Compaq adapted from the mini and mainframe worlds.andP;  This approachsynchronizes multiple drives for speed- and fault-tolerant features such asdisk mirroring, dynamic backup, and duplexing.andP;  Compaq optimized themachine's drive-seek algorithms to group small, scattered requests (usingwhat's known in the trade as &quot;scattergather&quot; techniques) typical of LANenvironments.andP;  Data can be split up and stored on one of several disks, thenmerged back together in the disk controller before being sent to the CPU.andO;This also means that files can span multiple disk volumes, as is supported inNetware 386.andM;Positioning.andP;  Compaq doesn't hesitate to say that it is directly targetingthe minicomputer market with the Systempro line.andP;  This move makes sense,given Compaq's traditional positioning at the top end of the Pc marketplacein price and performance.andP;  Evidently IBM agrees, since it was showing a PS/2Model 70 sporting an AOX '486 processor board, a pair of 32-bit bus masterSCSI disk controllers supporting seven 320-MB hard disks, and two Token Ringnetwork adapters.andP;  The IBM &quot;technology demo&quot; didn't support the Compaqmachine's drive-array techniques, but IBM indicated that it could be modifiedto do so.andM;The importance of these developments shouldn't be underestimated.andP;  With theintroduction of true multiprocessing network servers such as those fromNetFrame (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  3, p. 66) and Compaq and that demonstrated byIBM, the desktop hardware world is beginning to encroach on the mini andmainframe worlds, just as desktop software standards such as PostScript havealready done.andP;  Soon powerful systems, loaded with server-based applications,will be able to supplant minis and mainframes in a variety of theirtraditional applications.andP;  A number of companies have already announced theirintentions to replace mini-based solutions with Compaq Systempro-basedsystems, and we expect still more to do so.andM;By launching the Systempro in conjunction with LAN Manager 2.0, Compaq issignaling that it is no longer sufficient to stuff the pipeline withever-more-powerful hunks of iron without also providing the system-leveltools that exploit that iron to the fullest.andP;  It will be exciting to watchthe wave of new applications capable of using this power roll out in the nearfuture.andP;  STay tuned.andM;The Haves vs.andP;  the Have NotsandM;Intel has been trying for some time to convince the world to give up its loveaffair with 80286-based machines, andinstead to sample the pleasures of the32-bit world via the '386/'486 product lines.andP;  After all, Intel had anexclusive lock on the '386 architecture, whereas some competing firms had alicense to manufacture '286 chips.andP;  Because the step up to the 32-bit worldwas a large one, at least in terms of end-user cost, Intel introduced sometime ago the 386SX, a 32-bit '386 processor surrounded by 16-bit I/O.andP;  Theadvantage of the 386SX is that systems can be built around it that uselow-cost 8- and 16-bit support chips and memory.andM;Well, the 386SX has been slow to catch on, largely because Intel initiallypriced it at a significant premium over competing '286 chip designs, some ofwhich can achieve near-386SX performance.andM;Just before Comdex, Intel blitzed the market with full-page ads in newspapersand newsweekly magazines, billboards, and direct-mail pieces showing thenumber &quot;286&quot; crossed out with a red graffiti-spray-paint-style X and &quot;386SX&quot;(with the &quot;SX&quot; drawn in the same color and style as the X through the &quot;286&quot;)to the right of it.andM;Walking the aisles at Comdex made it apparent that Intel's propaganda(coupled with several rounds of hefty price reductions for the 386SX chip)was beginning to work: virtually every PC manufacturer was showing at leastone 386SX machine.andM;What's more interesting is that the 386SX is showing up in many portables andlaptops.andP;  This makes a lot of sense, since the current '386 chip set isgenerally too power hungry to run on batteries, a requirement for mostlaptops.andP;  Dell and Tandon both had especially nice implementations--Dell witha 15-pound machine, the System 316LT, sporting a removable VGA supertwistbacklit LCD display and a 20- or 40-MB hard disk ($,3799 for the 40 MBversion), and Tandon with a similar-spec'ed machine listing (with 40-MBdrive) for $4,429.andM;We expect that when the next release of Windows and the 32-bit version ofOS/2 are introduced, the demand for 32-bit PCs will increase significantly.andO;The 386SX should provide an affordable entry into 32-bit computing, at only aslight premium over high-end '286 designs, with only a 10-40% reduction inperformance over a 16-MHz '386 implementation.andM;PrintersandM;As expected, the recent introductions of the HP LaserJet IIP and the IBM4019, both setting price/performance hurdles that other vendors are forced toleap, resulted in a spate of new product announcements at Comdex.andP;  Each newprinter claimed to outdo the IIP (and, to a lesser extent, the 4019) infeatures, while selling at or below the IIP's list price.andM;At the same time, several vendors announced that they had patented methods bywhich they can achieve 600- or 1,000-dpi output resolution with a Canon SXengine.andP;  Should these implementations hold up to our expectations for qualityand reliability, they could prove to be serious competition for the currentoutput quality leaders, such as Printware and Varityper/Tegra.andM;At the same time, at least one new color laser printer made its debut atComdex: the $29,950 Color Laser Printer from CSS Labs.andP;  And the competitionflocked to TI's booth during the show to see its new PostScript-equippedMicroLaser Printer, one of the first under-$3,000 Adobe PostScriptimplementations on the market.andM;PostScript after the shootout.andP;  Walking around the show, we asked all theprinter manufacturers with PostScript products the same basic questions:&quot;Since John Warnock's announcement [about sharing Adobe's font technology] atthe Seybold Conference in September, what interaction has taken place betweenyou and Adobe?andP;  Has anything happened?&quot;andP;  The most colorful answer, typical ofall the responses, was &quot;We're talking on the phone, but we're not even datingyet.&quot;andM;It was clear from talking to the manufacturers and vendors that in fontsupport, they will follow the wanderings of the market.andP;  This is hardlysurprising; none of the vendors voiced a belief that they can drive themarket.andP;  The printer makers will try to get Adobe to cooperate, but they arenot sitting around waiting for what to happen.andP;  At the same time, they aretaking a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude about the Royal fonts--after all, as onevendor commented, we are at least a year away from seeing something real.andM;In sum, it appears that the effects of Adobe's September announcements haveyet to be felt.andP;  In the eyes of the manufacturers we talked to, Adobe seemslargely unmoved by the threat from Microsoft and Apple.andP;  Its reputation as afirm that is difficult to do business with is unsullied.andP;  The hiatus betweenMicrosoft's announcement and the arrival of any real products should be agolden opportunity for Adobe to court new licensees and third-partysupporters aggressively.andP;  Apparently, Adobe hasn't seen it that way.andM;Adobe's pace, we think, can best be described as deliberate.andP;  In promising topublish the Type 1 font format, Adobe warned everyone that the publicationprocess would take time.andP;  In addition to the normal delays in any technicalpublication for quality control and copy editing, Adobe wants to clean upcertain parts of its act before taking the wraps off.andP;  It faces a dualchallenge: publishing enough information to combat the perception that it iskeeping secrets from legitimate third parties, while giving away no moreproprietary technology than it absolutely has to.andM;Still, one feels that it could only help Adobe's cause to be a little moreevangelical.andM;TI's MicroLaser Personal Page Printer.andP;  This is one cute little machine.andO;About the size of a LaserJet IIP, it uses a new Sharp 6-ppm print engine (theIP1A used in Sharp's own 9500 series) that is a decided improvement over theRicoh engines Texas Instruments uses in its other PostScript printers.andM;The MicroLaser comes in two versions.andP;  The first is a LaserJet II-compatiblemodel with 14 internal fonts, 512 KB of RAM, a 250-sheet input tray and aparallel interface (serial is optional) for $1,999.andP;  The second model addsAdobe PostScript, the standard 35 LaserWriter typefaces and 1 MB of RAM totransform the MicroLaser into a full-fledged PostScript printer.andP;  It listsfor $3,000.andP;  (The LaserJet-compatible model can be easily upgraded later toinclude PostScript and the extra memory for $1,000).andM;The printer can be enhanced with an optional 250-sheet second tray or a40-enveloped feeder, each for $395.andP;  Additional RAM can be added (up to 4.5MB total) in 1-MB increments for $495 per MB.andP;  If you have already upgradedyour memory, PostScript ROMs can be added for $795.andM;Both versions support a novel online help facility.andP;  Forget where you are inthe setup menu?andP;  You can print out a flow chart indicating where in the menuyou are, how you got there, and where you can go from there.andP;  All printersshould support such a capability.andM;Print samples we saw from the prototype units being demonstrated (the printerwill be shipped in early December) showed rich blacks--almost too rich, inthat the characters seemed a little too horsey, suprising for a write-blackmachine.andP;  We will reserve judgment until we put a unit into operation in ourshop, which we hope to do soon.andM;HanZon board.andP;  HanZon Data's laser printer controller board offers theMicrosoft (Bauer) version of PostScript for HP Series II and Canon LBP8II/IIIowners.andP;  We can't verify HanZon's speed claims (&quot;up to 22 times faster thanthe Apple LaserWriter standard&quot;), but we can tell you it will probably be outearly next year and will retail for $2,495.andP;  The StellarPS is designed forXT/AT machines.andM;PCL printers.andP;  There are many more vendors and models for PCL-compatiblelaser printers than of PostScript-compatible machines.andP;  Hewlett-Packard hasbeen the standard setter in this arena, year in and year out, ever since theLaserJet was introduced.andP;  By now, all the major players have 6- or 8-ppmmachines; they are hastening now to add 4-ppm printers to their productlines.andP;  To give you the flavor of what's happening in this market, here are afew of the announcements at this year's Comdex.andM;Okidata introduced a 4-ppm PCL printer, the OkiLaser 400, targeted directlyat HP's recently announced 4-ppm product, the LaserJet IIP (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andO;1).andP;  The OkiLaser 400 has several competitive advantages:andM;* It comes with a 250-sheet input tray--the IIP has only a 50-sheet inputtray.andM;* Its price is $1,395, compared to the IIP list price of $1,495.andM;* It has 17 resident fonts; the HP has 14.andM;On the down side, there is one potential troublesome difference for users oflarge amounts of printer memory--the Okidata unit is expandable only to 2.5MB, while the HP can hold up to 4.5 MB.andP;  Base memory configuration for bothprinters is 512K.andM;As we predicted in an earlier issue, Canon has released its own printer, theLBP-4, based on the same engine used in the HP IIP, but it is not HPcompatible.andP;  It uses the Canon Printing System Language (Capsl).andP;  Diablo 630emulation is also built in.andP;  Current optional emulations include HPGL and IBMProprinter.andP;  Adobe PostScript is planned.andP;  List price is $1,545.andM;In addition, PCPI announced its 4IIP controller, enabling other manufacturersto rapidly produce HP IIP clones.andP;  This will keep downward pressure on theprice of 4-ppm printers and will assure that Level 4 PCL (the current versionof HP's language) will be around for a long time.andP;  It will appeal to anyonewho is looking for a relatively inexpensive way to put ideas on paper and whodoesn't particularly care whether it is a dot-matrix or ink-jet method.andO;Would they pay a little bit more for a low-end laser?andP;  We think some of themjust might, since the IIP is being advertised at under $1,000--less than somedot-matrix printers--and the clones will be even lower.andM;There are still some applications that need dot-matrix and other impactprinters: multicopy forms come to mind.andP;  But they are getting fewer all thetime.andM;The best of both worlds.andP;  The appeal of a shared printer for small to mediumnetworks is clear.andP;  But what if you need both PostScript and PCL support?andO;Kyocera's 10-ppm, 300-dpi Q-8010 is both PCL- and PostScript-compatible; moreimportant, it can print either language without any hardware or softwareswitching.andM;The printer has three ports: parallel, serial and AppleTalk.andP;  Each can beassigned its own emulation; for example, all PostScript files could be sentto either the AppleTalk or serial ports and all HP files could be sent to theparallel port.andP;  All three ports can be active simultaneously.andP;  In addition,PostScript and PCL commands can be mixed on the same page.andP;  The printer'slist price is $6,995 and it is available now.andM;Color, color everywhere.andP;  We live in a world of color, but until quiterecently we could not, in the privacy of our offices, print in color.andP;  It ishard to believe the difference color capability makes in the minds of mostusers.andP;  We remember when, shortly after Comdex/Fall '88, one of our readersappeared in our office, a look of exaltation in his eyes, clutching whatlooked for all the world to be a piece of paper with small globs of coloredwax all over it.andP;  Imagine what you might get if you left a ten-year-old, aniron, a box of colored crayons, and a piece of heat-sensitive paper alone forseveral hours on a rainy afternoon.andP;  But it was a recognizable image and itwas in color.andM;The idea of personal and immediate color printing is enormously attractive.andO;But, so far, every time we've gone to a show, the vendors have said, &quot;Sorry,we're not there yet, but how about this in the meantime?&quot;andM;Color printers are getting smaller, cheaper and faster.andP;  (Whether or not theyproduce good enough color will be the subject of many articles to come.)andO;Some interesting new color printers were shown at Comdex.andM;NEC produced the Colormate PS, an under-$10,000 ($9,995, to be precise)thermal-transfer PostScript printer.andP;  Similar to the QMS ColorScript 100Model 10, the NEC unit has 35 resident fonts and a 68020-based interpreter.andO;Like QMS, NEC has licensed Pantone's color-specification system and includesPantone's color tables in the Colormate PS.andM;Panasonic introduced the EPL-8543, a color wax thermal printer.andP;  Using a 2 X2 dither pattern, it can produce up to 16 shades of gray and purportedly morethan 200,000 colors.andP;  List price is $7,995.andM;If you are not fussy about the imaging method but do want PostScript,Textronix has two new color ink-jet printers: the Phaser CQ (for XT- andAT-bus computers) and Phaser CQS (for the Macintosh), each less than $9,000.andO;Both the 216-dpi printers and support common paper sizes from letter totabloid.andM;Color on plain paper.andP;  CSS Laboratories demonstrated a dry-toner, plain-papercolor laser printer.andP;  It uses the Colorocs engine (previewed at the SeyboldConference two months ago), and it is impressive.andP;  While we were in thebooth, a passerby picked up one of the printouts and asked in an awed voice,&quot;Is this plain paper?&quot;andP;  The vendor said yes and offered to show him thepackage label.andM;Color Magic is the name, and $29,950 is its suggested retail price.andP;  Printerswill be shipped in December.andP;  PostScript emulation supports will be availablein the first quarter of 1990.andP;  CSS has written a Windows driver for theproduct, making it directly useful for any Windows application.andP;  At thispoint, CSS has only developed an adapter kit for XT/AT type machines, but weexpect other interfaces to be offered in time.andP;  Considering the limitationsimposed by 300-dpi resolution, the basic four colors look fine, but sometimesthe others look blotchy or uneven.andP;  CSS is working on using a differentdither pattern to overcome these problems.andM;QMS is also developing a PostScript printer based on the Colorocs engine, butit is not ready to be shown yet.andP;  We have heard from reliable sources that itwill take another 6 to 8 months and that it will retail for about $40,000.andM;OS/2 printers.andP;  QMS announced its contribution to the world of OS/2 in theform of the QMSWriter PM10 printer.andP;  Based on the same engine used in theColorScript Model 10, it can be used with all OS/2 software for both colorand monochrome printing.andP;  And when you get tired of applications usingPresentation Manager's Graphic Programming Interface (GPI), you can alwaysswitch over to DOS programs because it is also a PCL and HPGL printer.andM;The PM10's list price is $9,995; it will begin to be shipped to end usersbefore the end of the first quarter of 1990.andP;  In the meantime, QMS isconcentrating on signing up and equipping OS/2 software developers.andM;LaserMaster said that it is shipping an OS/2 controller card for either theHP LaserJet or the LaserMaster 1000, giving users another OS/2 printingoption.andP;  Prices vary: $1,895 to $3,395 for HP and $7,495 for the 1000.andO;Registered users of existing LX6 controllers can get a software upgrade thatoffers the same features.andM;Resolution boosters.andP;  For its printer controllers, LaserMaster makes twoclaims to fame.andP;  First, they boost the horizontal addressability of anordinary laser printer, giving up to 1,000 dpi in one dimension.andP;  (Theaddressability along the other dimension is fixed by the printer'smechanism.)andP;  This does improve the quality of output, though not as much asthe advertising would lead you to believe.andP;  Bottom line--you can't get true1,000 dpi out of 300- or 400-dpi marking engine.andM;Second, they run very fast.andP;  However, they are not true PostScriptcontrollers--Adobe Illustrator and certain other applications simply can'tuse them--although they do rasterize a subset of the PostScript language.andO;Thus, they can handle Encapsulated PostScript files from quite a fewapplications.andP;  The danger is that, in the ext release of your favoriteprogram, or when running a particular EPS graphic, the controller will hit aPostScript operator it can't deal with and some or all of the page won'tprint.andM;DP-Tek also claimed resolution enhancement and PostScript compatibility withits new printer adapter board.andP;  The adapter purportedly boosts the HPLaserJet Series II resolution to a true 600 X 600 dpi.andP;  Does it work?andP;  Well,it does look better than standard HP Series II output.andM;Board, cable and software will retail for $1,195 when it is released inJanuary.andP;  The software requires a minimum of 5.5 MB of memory for full-pagegraphics.andP;  It supports PageMaker, Ventura Publisher, Microsoft Word andWindows, WordPerfect, AutoCad and AutoShade.andM;Scanners and OCRandM;OmniPage add-ons.andP;  Caere Corp. began shipping OmniPage 2.0 (for '386computers) this summer--the version without the adapter board.andP;  A freeupgrade, OmniPage 2.1, was announced at Comdex.andP;  Version 2.1 can readdocuments saved in compressed TIFF format and contains &quot;hooks&quot; to let ithandle four new add-on products, also introduced at Comdex.andP;  The upgrade andthree of the auxiliary products will be available by the time you are readingthis.andP;  All are available in both PC and Mac format.andM;The add-on products make an already good package more versatile.andP;  OmniDraft($100 retail) enables OmniPage to read draft mode 9-pin dot-matrix output.andO;During a brief demonstration by Caere representatives, OmniDraft enhanced theOmniPage's accuracy of the resulting scanned file greatly.andP;  Text can rangefrom 8 to 72 points.andM;OmniProof ($150) offers an interesting and much-needed feature for somebusinesses.andP;  It allows the user to compare two word processing files fromeither PCs or Macs and does not require that the files be generated byOmniPage.andP;  It can, for example, compare two documents created in MicrosoftWord (PC to PC or Mac to Mac, but not PC to Mac).andM;It can also work with documents that have been scanned and &quot;recognized&quot; by anOCR package (not necessarily OmniPage).andP;  The documents must be typed orprinted before scanning, but once that is done, the program looks for andidentifies changes such as insertions, deletions, replacements and rearrangedtext.andP;  There are limits to its abilities--for example, using it for acomplete rewrite would probably not yield much useful information.andM;Once the comparison is completed, you can view the two documents side by sideand make more changes.andP;  All previous changes are highlighted on the screen.andO;You can even ask for a report listing all changes to both documents anddetails thereof.andP;  This is a boon to lawyers, editors, writers checking forcriminal mischief inflicted on their work by editors, or anyone who needs tocompare two documents quickly.andP;  Here is perhaps the clearest example of howscanner software is becoming more attuned to user needs.andM;The two remaining programs are OmniSpell ($100) and OmniTrace ($150).andO;OmniSpell checks the scanned file for typing and optical characterrecognition errors, such as mistaking a 5 for an S.andP;  It looks at how eachletters is formed in order to decide what that letter really is.andP;  It has a100,000-word American English dictionary, as well as one composed of 157,000unique words drawn from Stedman's medical and Black's legal dictionaries.andO;Eleven optional dictionaries exist and users can create custom dictionaries.andM;OmniTrace, which will not be available until the first quarter of 1990,converts scanned (bitmap) images to vector images and saves them asEncapsulated PostScript files.andP;  It has an editor to allow some changes to bemade before the file is saved.andP;  Like OmniProof, OmniTrace does not requireOmniPage 2.1 to function.andM;Gray-scale scanners.andP;  Several gray-scale scanners made their debuts atComdex.andP;  Kyocera was demonstrating the A-800, a flatbed 4-bit scanner with400-dpi optical resolution and 800-dpi output resolution.andP;  There are 400 CCDSper inch in the scanning element, which means the scanner captures scaninformation at 400 dpi, but software can interpolate the data to producesomething like 800 dpi on output.andP;  In general, interpolating scanned data forresolutions such as 800 dip (or 600 dpi, in the case of the HP ScanJet Plus)is not as effective as capturing the same amount of information about animage; it cannot be said to be a true equivalent.andM;The scanner comes with Kyocera's ImageDesk software, which captures the imageand offers limited editing capabilities.andP;  List price is $1,995.andP;  An optionalautomatic document feeder, which allows you to scan legal-size pages, isavailable for $895.andM;Pentax announced its own flatbed 4-bit scanner; it boasts a legal-sizescanning bed, but its optical resolution is at most 300 dpi.andP;  The SB-L301Model 1, which has a PC interface, retails for $1,399; the SB-L301 Model 2provides a Macintosh SCSI interface and retails for $1,599.andP;  Purchasers mayselect among several gray-scale editing and OCR packages.andM;Panasonic's new flatbed scanner also has a legal-size scanning bed and300-dpi optical resolution.andP;  Using PanaScan Plus software, the accompanyingscanning utility, optical resolutions of up to 2,450 dpi are possible, usingthe same kind of interpolating idea as the Kyocera A-800.andP;  Futhermore,outputting at a higher resolution rjeduces the size of the image.andP;  Afull-page image scanned at 300 dpi and output at 2,540 would be roughly 2inces by 2.75 inches, one-fourth its original size.andP;  The scanner's list priceis $1,599, the AT interface kit is $400, and the Macintosh interface is $500.andM;The IX-30F, Canon's new 8-bit flatbed scanner, was also demonstrated atComdex and is expected to be available after January, 1990.andP;  The $1,595 listprice pays for the scanner and an accompanying gray-scale editing package (nodetails are available on the software).andP;  If you are connecting the scanner toa PC, you'll also need the $595 SCSI interface kit that includes the cable,interface software and adapter card.andP;  A Macintosh interface kit is expectedto be available in the fifrst quarter of 1990.andP;  This scanner can also beequipped with a automatic document feeder, a $595 option.andM;Chinon introduced PS/2- and Macintosh-compatible versions of its DS-3000overhead gray-scale scanner.andP;  The PS/2 version includes utility software,adapter card and cable; the suggested retail price is $895.andP;  The Macintoshpackage for the DS-3000 is $895, or $695 for the DS-2000 version.andP;  CurrentChinon scanner owners may purchase the package for $220.andM;Oversize and undersize.andP;  And if you need to scan jreally big pages, HoustonInstruments' LDS-4000 wide-format scanner is for you.andP;  It looks like anoversize pants press, but it can be connected to any AT-class computer andscans pages of up to ANSI E-size and DIN A0 Oversize.andP;  Maximum scan width is36 inches and maximum resolution is 300 dpi.andP;  Currently it supports onlythree file formats: RLC, IMG, and CUT.andP;  If you need TIFF, you are out ofluck.andP;  The price is $13,995.andM;Handheld scanners seemed to be in every nook and cranny.andP;  They areinexpensive and fun to have around.andP;  (Image alignment, however, is a chancything.)andP;  Two new products from Nisca are worthy of mention.andP;  Both will appearin late spring.andP;  One is a small color scanner similar to Sharp's JX-100 (seeVol.andP;  4, No.andP;  3, p. 26) except that it captures all the data in one passwhile the JX-100 requires three passes for one picture.andP;  Innovation costsmoney: the retail price of the Niscan Spectra is expected to be around$1,100, about $100 more than the JX-100.andM;Nisca was also demonstrating its 8-bit Niscan/GS, which it said was the onlyhandheld gray-scale scanner.andP;  It scans a stripe 4&quot; wide; the length of thestrip is limited only by memory and disk space.andP;  Resolution is up to 400 dpi.andO;Retail price is expected to be about $350.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
