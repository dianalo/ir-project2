An Alaska Army National Guard Skycrane helicopter was readied tolift off early today from Prudhoe Bay to tow a 185-tonHovercraft-type ice-breaking barge 200 miles northwest to thewhales. The trip was expected to take from 25 to 40 hours.   Mike Haller, a National Guard spokesman, said the lift wasdelayed Monday while VECO Inc., the oil field service company thatowns the barge, repaired some of the air skirts on the underside ofthe vehicle.   It had been anticipated the operation would get under way about11 a.m. EDT today, but it was delayed by a few hours. By midmorningAlaska time (midafternoon EDT), fueling of the barge and theprocess of rigging the helicopter to the barge were almostcompleted but the barge was still at Prudhoe Bay.   ``It took longer to get the barge ready than anticipated,''Haller said earlier today. ``The crews worked all night, and thepilots want to make sure there's as much daylight as possible.''   The endangered California gray whales became trapped whilemigrating south to warmer waters. The 24-30-foot-long mammals werebleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jagged iceand were exhausted from swimming against the ocean current toremain in place.   The whales were trapped 18 miles northeast of this InupiatEskimo village. They were only a few hundred feet offshore in 45feet of water, with their largest ice hole about 10-by-20 feet.   Villagers and biologists used ice picks Monday to keep thebreathing holes open in the 6-inch thick ice, but sub-zerotemperatures threatened to seal them.   Ron Morris, with the National Marine Fisheries Service, said heand several veterinarians went onto the ice Monday to study thewhales, and noticed that one had symptoms of pneumonia.   ``Their condition has worsened since they were first spotted,''Morris said. ``One has a little pneumonia but the others are allright. We're being cautiously optimistic.   ``We've got only one way to go, and that's up. But there's noquestion in my mind that they'll be here when the vehicle arrives.''   The whales ordinarily can stay underwater nearly four minuteswithout air, said Geoff Carroll, a North Slope Borough biologist.Carroll said they have been surfacing about every two minutes,indicating they were becoming tired and under stress.   Biologists said they are surprised the trapped whales have notdrawn the attention of polar bears, and they carried shotgunsMonday night in case the large predators showed up.   They said they were overwhelmed by the interest in the trappedwhales. ``Every year, probably dozens of grays drown or are crushedby the ice, but nobody ever knows about it,'' said biologist CraigGeorge.   The interest even extended to Washington, where White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that President Reagan maycall the people in charge of the whale rescue this afternoon tooffer moral support.   Rescuers raced against onshore winds that threatened to closebreaks in the ice that would serve as an escape route if theice-breaking barge is able to free them.   ``It was 17 below last night,'' Carroll said. ``The thickness ofthe ice is increasing rapidly. It's growing a matter of inchesevery day.''   Environmentalists, federal authorities and the oil industry havejoined in the unusual alliance to rush the icebreaking barge to thewhales so it can crush a narrow path to open water a half-dozenmiles away.   Crews labored around the clock during the weekend and into theArctic darkness Monday to get the barge and the Skycrane ready.   ``We're not going to move that thing until we can make surewe'll have a clean run to Barrow,'' said Pete Leathard, a spokesmanfor Veco Inc., an oil field servicing company that owns the barge.``The Arctic is not a good place to break down in winter.''   Plans called for the helicopter to pull the 85-by-60-foot bargewith an 800-foot cable, Haller said.   ``The plan has great potential for danger because of thealtitude of the helicopter in the towing position. The nose isdown,'' he said. ``The danger is that if a line snaps and comesback up and gets in the rotors, we've got real trouble.''   The helicopter, which costs $1,500 to $3,000 an hour to operate,will trade off with a second Skycrane, which has been flown toPrudhoe Bay. The barge is to carry 20,000 gallons of fuel for thehelicopters and the barge, Haller said. The fuel was provided byArco Alaska Inc.   Oil company officials have estimated that that portion of therescue effort could cost as much as $500,000.   Greenpeace representative Cindy Lowry arrived here Sunday withrecordings of migrating whales that she wants to play along the icefloe to lure the whales to safety.   California grays number about 20,000 and have been growing anaverage 2.5 percent a year for the past decade.   The whales spend their winters in the warm waters off Mexico andSouthern California.</TEXT></DOC>
