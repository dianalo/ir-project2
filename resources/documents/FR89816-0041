The NPL is AppendixB to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan(``NCP''), which was promulgated on July 16, 1982, pursuant to section105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and LiabilityAct of 1980 (``CERCLA''). CERCLA has since been amended by the SuperfundAmendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (``SARA'') and is implementedby Executive Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987). CERCLA requiresthat that NCP include a list of national priorities among the known releasesor threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminantsthroughout the United States, and that the list be revised at least annually.The NPL, initially promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658), constitutesthis list.This update proposes to add two new sites to the NPL, the Radium ChemicalCompany Site, in Woodside, Queens, New York, and the Forest Glen MobileHome Subdivision Site in Niagara Falls, New York. Both are proposed forthe NPL on the basis of andSection; 300.66(b)(4) of the NCP (50 FR 37624,September 16, 1985). Section 300.66(b)(4) provides that, in addition tothose releases identified by their Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scores ascandidates for the NPL, EPA may identify for inclusion on the NPL any otherrelease that the Agency determines is a significant threat to public health,welfare or the environment. This notice provides the public with an opportunityto comment on placing the Radium Chemical Company Site and the Forest GlenMobile Home Subdivision Site on the NPL.This proposed rule brings the number of proposed NPL sites to 337, 74 ofthem in the Federal section; 889 sites are on the final NPL, 41 of themin the Federal section. Final and proposed sites now total 1,226.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before September 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments may be mailed, in triplicate, to Larry Reed,Acting Director, Hazardous Site Evaluation Division (Attn: NPL Staff),Office of Emergency and Remedial Response (OS-230), U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington DC 20460.

Introduction</ITAG>BackgroundIn 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601-9657 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act'') in responseto the dangers of uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites. CERCLAwas amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct (``SARA''), Public Law 99-499, stat. 1613 <T3>et seq. </T3>To implement CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency(``EPA'' or ``the Agency'') promulgated the revised National Oil and HazardousSubstances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR part 300, on July16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP, further revised by EPA onSeptember 16, 1985 (50 FR 37624), and November 20, 1985 (50 FR 47912),sets forth the guidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLAto releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,or contaminants. On December 21, 1988 (53 FR 51394), EPA proposed revisionsto the NCP in response to SARA.Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the NCPinclude ``criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatenedreleases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedialaction and, to the extent practicable, take into account the potentialurgency of such action for the purpose of taking removal action.'' Removalaction involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response toemergency conditions or on a short-term or temporary basis (CERCLA) section101(23)). Remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involvesresponse actions that are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release(CERCLA section 101(24)). Criteria for determining priorities for possibleremedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA areincluded in the Hazard Ranking Systems (``HRS''), which EPA promulgatedas Appendix A of the NCP (47 FR 31219, July 16, 1982). On December 23,1988 (53 FR 51962), EPA proposed revisions to the HRS in response to CERCLAsection 105(c), added by SARA.In addition to the applications of the HRS, there are two other mechanismsby which EPA prioritizes sites for the purpose of taking remedial action.Under CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) each State may designate a single siteas its top priority, regardless of the HRS score. Under the third mechanism,included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(b)(4), the Agency may address sitesas which the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) recommendsdissociation of individuals from the release, at which EPA determines thatthe release poses a significant public health threat, and for which EPAanticipates that it would be more cost effective to use remedial ratherthan removal authorities for cleanup. The three mechanisms are describedin more detail in the NPL Update Process section, Section III, of the SupplementaryInformation portion of this preamble.Based on these criteria, and pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA,as amended by SARA, EPA prepared a list of national priorities among theknown releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,or contaminants throughout the United States. The list, which is AppendixB of the NCP, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). CERCLA section105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. Asite can undergo CERCLA-financed remedial action only after it is placedon the NPL, as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2) and 300.68(a).An original NPL of 406 sites was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR40658). The NPL has been expanded since then, most recently on March 31,1989 (54 FR 13296). The Agency also has published a number of proposedrulemakings to add sites to the NPL, most recently Update andplusmin;9 onJuly 14, 1989 (54 FR 29820). EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate,as explained in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(7). To date, the Agency hasdeleted 27 sites from the final NPL, most recently on May 31, 1989 (54FR 23212), when Voortman Farm, Upper Saucon Township, Pennsylvania, wasdeleted. Pursuant to the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(b)(4), this notice proposes to addtwo sites to the NPL. Adding these two sites to the 335 sites previouslyproposed brings the total number of proposed sites to 337. The final NPLcontains 889 sites, for a total of 1,226 final and proposed sites. EPA may include on the NPL sites at which there are or have been releasesor threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.The discussion below may refer to ``releases or threatened releases'' simplyas ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.'' Public Comment PeriodThis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice opens the formal 30-day comment periodfor this NPL Update. Comments may be mailed to Larry Reed, Acting Director,Hazardous Site Evaluation Division (Attn: NPL staff), Office of Emergencyand Remedial Response (OS-230), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. The Headquarters and Region 2 public dockets for the NPL (see <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>portion of this notice) contain documents relating tothe scoring of these proposed sites. The dockets are available for viewing,by appointment only, after the appearance of this notice. The hours ofoperation for the Headquarters docket are from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.,Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays. The hours of operationfor the Region 2 docket are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday throughFriday excluding Federal holidays. The Headquarters docket for the two sites proposed in this NPL Update containHRS score sheets, a Documentation Record describing the information usedto compute the score, a list of documents referenced in the DocumentationRecord, the public health advisory issued by the Agency for Toxic Substancesand Disease Registry, and EPA memoranda supporting the findings that therelease poses a significant threat to public health and that it would bemore cost-effective to use remedial rather than removal authorities atthe sites. The Regional docket includes all information available in the Headquartersdocket, as well as the actual reference documents, which contain the dataEPA relied upon in calculating or evaluating the HRS score for these sites.These reference documents are available only in the Region 2 docket. An informal written request, rather than a formal request, should be theordinary procedure for obtaining copies of any of these documents. EPA considers all comments received during the formal comment period. Duringthe comment period, comments are available to the public only in the Headquartersdocket. A complete set of comments will be available for viewing in theRegional docket approximately one week after the formal comment periodcloses. Comments received after the comment period closes will be availablein the Headquarters docket and in the Regional Office docket on an ``asreceived'' basis. An informal written request, rather than a formal request,should be the ordinary procedure for obtaining copies of any comments.After considering the relevant comments received during the comment period,EPA will add these sites to the NPL if they continue to meet requirementsset out in the NCP. EPA will read all comments received on these sites,including late comments. In past rules, EPA responded even to late comments.However, given the need to make final decisions on all currently proposedsites prior to the date that the revised HRS takes effect, EPA will notbe able to respond to all late comments received for sites in this rule.However, the Agency has routinely responded to late comments that resultfrom EPA correspondence that provided commenters with more recent dataor requested that the commenters be more specific in their comments. Early CommentsIn certain instances, interested parties have written to EPA concerningsites that were not, at that time, proposed to the NPL. Because such submissionswere not set to EPA during a formal comment period on the sites of concern,they are not considered to be formal comments. If those sites are laterproposed to the NPL, parties should review their earlier concerns and,if they still consider them appropriate, resubmit those concerns for considerationduring the formal comment period. Site-specific correspondence receivedprior to formal proposal generally will not be included in the docket.Comments Lacking SpecificityEPA anticipates that some comments will consist of or include additionalstudies or supporting documentation, e.g., hydrogeology reports, lab data,and previous site studies. Where commenters do not indicate what specificscoring issues the supporting documentation addresses, or what they wantEPA to evaluate in the supporting documentation, EPA can only attempt torespond to such documents as best it can. Any commenter submitting additionaldocumentation should indicate what specific points in that documentationthat it would like for EPA to consider. As the U.S. Court of Appeals forthe District of Columbia Circuit noted in <T3>Northside Sanitary Landfill </T3>v. <T3>Thomas andamp; EPA, </T3>849 F. 2d 1516, 1520 (D.C. Cir. 1988) <T3>cert. denied, </T3>109 S. Ct. 1528 (1989), during notice-and-commentrulemaking a commenter must explain with some specificity how any documentssubmitted are relevant to issues in the rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose and Implementation of the NPL</ITAG>PurposeThe primary purpose of the NPL is stated in the legislative history ofCERCLA (Report of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, SenateReport No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980)): <ITAG tagnum="21">The priority lists serve primarily informational purposes, identifyingfor the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releaseswhich appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a facility or siteon the list does not in itself reflect a judgment of the activities ofits owner or operator, it does not require those persons to undertake anyaction, not does it assign liability to any person. Subsequent governmentaction in the form of remedial actions or enforcement action will be necessaryin order to do so, and these actions will be attended by all appropriateprocedural safeguards.</ITAG>The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informationaland management tool. The identification of a site for the NPL is intendedprimarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigationto assess the nature and extent of the public health and environmentalrisks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA-financed remedialaction(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify thepublic of sites that EPA believes warrant further investigation. Implementation EPA has limited, by regulation, the expenditure of Trust Fund monies forremedial actions to those sites that have been placed on the final NPL,as outlined in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2) and 300.68(a). However, EPAmay take enforcement actions under CERCLA or other applicable statutesagainst responsible parties regardless of whether the site is on the NPL,although, as a practical matter, the focus of EPA's CERCLA enforcementactions has been and will continue to be on NPL sites. Similarly, in thecase of CERCLA removal actions, EPA has the authority to act at any site,whether listed or not, that meets the criteria of the NCP at 40 CFR 300.65-67.EPA's policy is to pursue cleanup of NPL sites using the appropriate responseand/or enforcement actions available to the Agency, including authoritiesother than CERCLA. Listing a site will serve as notice to any potentiallyresponsible party that the Agency may initiate CERCLA-financed remedialaction. The Agency will decide on a site-by-site basis whether to takeenforcement or other action under CERCLA or other authorities, proceeddirectly with CERCLA-financed response actions and seek to recover responsecosts after cleanup, or do both. To the extent feasible, once sites areon the NPL, EPA will determine high-priority candidates for Superfund-financeresponse action and/or enforcement action through both State and Federalinitiatives. These determinations will take into account which approachis more likely to most expeditiously accomplish cleanup of the site whileusing CERCLA's limited resources as efficiently as possible.Remedial response actions will not necessarily be funded in the same orderas a site's ranking on the NPL. Most sites are listed in the order of theirHRS scores, and the Agency has recognized that the information collectedto develop HRS scores is not sufficient in itself to determine either theextent of contamination or the appropriate response for a particular site.EPA relies on further, more detailed studies in the remedial investigation/feasibilitystudy (RI/FS) to address these concerns.The RI/FS determines the nature and extent of the threat presented by thecontamination (40 CFR 300.68(d)). It also takes into account the amountof contaminants in the environment, the risk to affected populations andenvironment, the cost to correct problems at the site, and the responseactions that have been taken by potentially responsible parties or others.Decisions on the type and extent of action to be taken at these sites aremade in accordance with the criteria contained in Subpart F of the NCP.After conducting these additional studies, EPA may conclude that it isnot desirable to initiate a CERCLA remedial action at some sites on theNPL because of more pressing needs at other sites, or because a privateparty cleanup is already underway pursuant to an enforcement action. Giventhe limited resources available in the Trust Fund, the Agency must carefullybalance the relative needs for response at the numerous sites it has studied.It is also possible that EPA will conclude after further analysis thatthe site does not warrant remedial action.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. NPL Update Process</ITAG>There are three mechanisms for placing sites on the NPL. The principalmechanism is the application of the HRS. The HRS serves as a screeningdevice to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substancesto cause human health or safety problems, or ecological or environmentaldamage. The HRS score represents an estimate of the relative ``probabilityand magnitude of harm to the human population or sensitive environmentfrom exposure to hazardous substances as a result of the contaminationof ground water, surface water, or air (47 FR 31180, July 16, 1982). Thosesites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL.Under the second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State maydesignate a single site as its top priority, regardless of the HRS score.This mechanism is provided by section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amendedby SARA, which requires that, to the extent practicable, the NPL includewithin the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each Staterepresenting the greatest danger to public health, welfare, or the environmentamong known facilities in the State.The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(b)(4)(50 FR 37624-28, September 16, 1985), allows certain sites with HRS scoresbelow 28.50 to be eligible for the NPL if all of the following occur:andbullet; The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) ofthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued a health advisorythat recommends dissocation of individuals from the release.andbullet; EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat topublic health.andbullet; EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use itsremedial authority than to use its removal authority to respond to therelease.This third mechanism was added to the NCP by rulemaking, during which theAgency explained that there are certain types of sites for which the riskmay not be fully reflected in the HRS score. For example, direct contactscores are not included in calculating the total HRS score, and thus somesites involving direct contact to residents may pose a serious threat butnot receive a sufficiently high score to qualify for the NPL. Similarly,where a small number of people are exposed to a hazardous substance, thesite may fail to qualify for listing due to the low targets score. Afteraccepting and responding to public comment, EPA issued a regulation thatwould allow the Agency to list sites where the ATSDR issues a health advisory,EPA determines that the site poses a significant health threat, and theAgency finds that it would be more cost-effective to use remedial ratherthan removal authority to respond to the release (50 FR at 37624-25).The two sites proposed for the NPL today are proposed under the third mechanismfor adding sites to the NPL. The specific application of the criteria forthis mechanism to the Radium Chemical Company Site and the Forest GlenMobile Home Subdivision Site is discussed in Section IV of this notice.States have the primary responsibility for identifying non-Federal sites,computing HRS scores, and submitting candidate sites to the EPA RegionalOffices. EPA Regional Offices conduct a quality control review of the States'candidate sites, and may assist in investigating, sampling, monitoring,and scoring sites. Regional Offices also may consider candidate sites inaddition to those submitted by States. EPA Headquarters conducts furtherquality assurance audits to ensure accuracy and consistency among the variousEPA and State offices participating in the scoring. The Agency then proposesthe sites that meet one of the three criteria for listing (and EPA's listingrequirements) and solicits public comment on the proposal. Based on thesecomments and further review by EPA, the Agency determines final HRS scoresand places those sites that still qualify on the final NPL.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Contents of This Proposed NPL Update</ITAG>The Radium Chemical Company (RCC) Site, in Woodside, Queens Borough, NewYork City, New York and the Forest Glen Mobile Home Subdivision Site inNiagara Falls, New York are being proposed for the NPL on the basis ofsection 300.66(b)(4) of the NCP (50 FR 37624, September 16, 1985). Section300.66(b)(4) provides that, in addition to those releases identified bytheir HRS scores as candidates for the NPL, EPA may identify for the NPLany other release that the Agency determines is a significant threat topublic health, welfare, or the environment. EPA may make such a determinationwhen ATSDR has issued a health advisory as a consequence of the release.Radium Chemical CompanyThe site consists of a one-story brick building located in a densely populatedresidential and commercial area of New York City. Established in Manhattanin 1913, RCC transferred operations to Woodside in the late 1950s. A separatemanufacturing company, which is unrelated to the RCC operation, occupiespart of the same building and shares a common wall with RCC.Initially, RCC produced luminous paint for watch dials and instruments.Later, it manufactured radium-containing needles and other sealed medicaldevices, largely for cancer therapy.In 1983, the State suspended RCC's operating license because of variousdisposal and safety infractions, and in 1986, the company was denied permissionto resume operations. In 1987, the State ordered RCC to remove the radiumand decontaminate the building. In 1987, the facility was abandoned, leavinga large number of radium-containing sealed containers at the site, someof which were suspected of releasing radium and radon gas. The amount ofradium-226 at the site was estimated to be 110 curies. Also on the sitewere hundreds of containers of laboratory chemicals, many of which werereactive, corrosive, flammable, and/or potentially shock sensitive.The State formally requested that EPA secure the plant and remove the radioactivematerials. In July 1988, EPA undertook a limited removal action using CERCLAemergency funds. EPA provided 24-hour security and took measures to stabilizethe site. In April 1989, EPA began to remove the radioactive and hazardousmaterials and transport them to approved disposal facilities.Elevated levels of radiation have been measured inside certain areas ofthe building. On February 10, 1989, ATSDR issued an advisory warning thatthe RCC Site poses a significant threat to public health because of thepotential for the release of radium-226.The advisory discusses two concerns. One is that an intruder might enterthe RCC Site from the adjoining manufacturing facility (as has happenedin the past) and remove radioactive materials. The second concern relatesto the potential for release of radioactive materials to the ambient environmentas a result of physical disturbance to the building. The RCC building islocated approximately 15 feet from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, a majorhighway used extensively for commercial trucking. The U.S. Department ofEnergy's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory has modelled scenarios involvinga gasoline tanker accident on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in the vicinityof the site, and has determined that the estimated 27,000 people who livewithin 1 mile of the site could be exposed to radiation if any were releasedin the event of a major accident.As a result of these concerns, ATSDR has recommended dissociation of theradioactive materials from individuals in the community. (<T3>See</T3> ``Public Health Advisory for Radium Chemical Company, Woodside,Queens, New York,'' issued by the ATSDR, February 10, 1989. This advisoryis included in the Superfund docket for this proposed rule.)EPA's assessment is that the site poses a significant threat to human healthand the environment, and EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effectiveto use remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to thesite. This finding is set out in a memorandum dated March 17, 1989, fromTimothy Fields, Jr., Director, Emergency Response Division to Larry Reed,Acting Director of the Hazardous Site Evaluation Division, both in theOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response. This memorandum is availablein the Superfund docket for this proposed rule. Based on this information,and the references in support of the proposal, EPA believes that the RadiumChemical Site is appropriate for the NPL pursuant to 40 CFR 300.66(b)(4).Forest Glen Mobile Home Subdivision SiteThe Forest Glen Mobile Home Subdivision Site is located in Niagara Falls,Niagara County, New York. The 21-acre site consists of 52 mobile homesand two permanent residences. Approximately 150 residents live in the area.Surface and subsurface soils at the site are contaminated with a varietyof chemicals.Prior to the 1960's the area was wooded wetland. During the 1960's thearea was cleared, and in the early 1970's, the area was filled with unspecifiedmaterials. The area was developed into a mobile home community in the 1970's.Analysis of soil samples collected from the site in 1988 and 1989 identifiedpolyaromatic hydrocarbons, aniline, phenothiazine, benzothiazine, and mercaptobenzothiazole.On July 21, 1989, ATSDR issued a preliminary Health Assessment, and onJuly 31, 1989 ATSDR issued a final Health Advisory recommending the dissociationof the residents of the community from the wastes and contaminated soilat the site. The advisory was based on the concern that residents of thecommunity may be exposed to hazardous substances as a result of dermalcontact with the soil (i.e. gardening, playing), through ingestion of producegrowth in the soil, or as a result of inhalation of concentrated vaporscollected in poorly ventilated, confined areas such as the space underthe skirt of the mobile homes. In addition, the advisory expressed concernregarding the physical stability of the disposal area beneath the site,and the potential for contamination of the public water supply.<ITAG tagnum="20">(</ITAG><T3>See</T3> ``Public Health Advisory for the Forest Glen Mobile Home Park,Niagara Falls, New York,'' issued by the ATSDR, on July 31, 1989. Thisdocument is included in the Superfund docket for this proposed rule.)EPA's assessment is that the site poses a significant threat to human healthand the environment, and EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effectiveto use remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to thesite. This finding is set out in a memorandum dated August 3, 1989, fromStephen Luftig, Director of the Region II Emergency and Remedial ResponseDivision to Larry Reed, Acting Director of the Hazardous Site EvaluationDivision. This memorandum is available in the Superfund docket for thisproposed rule.Based on this information, and the references in support of the proposal,EPA believes that the Forest Glen Mobile Home Subdivision Site is appropriatefor listing on the NPL pursuant to 40 CFR 300.66(b)(4).Table 1 following this preamble lists the two sites proposed for the NPLin this update. The entry contains the names and locations of the sites.Each proposed site is placed by HRS score in a group corresponding to groupsof 50 sites presented within the final NPL. For example, a site in Group8 of the proposed update has a score that falls within the range of scorescovered by the eighth group of 50 sites on the final NPL. The NPL is arrangedby HRS scores and is presented in groups of 50 to emphasize that minordifferences in scores do not necessarily represent significantly differentlevels of risk. Since these two sites have proposed HRS scores of lessthan 28.50, they are included in the group of sites with the lowest HRSscores.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>The costs of cleanup actions that may be taken at sites are not directlyattributable to listing on the NPL, as explained below. Therefore, theAgency has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``major'' regulationunder Executive Order 12291. EPA has conducted a preliminary analysis ofthe economic implications of today's proposal to add two new sites, andfinds that the kinds of economic effects associated with this proposedrevision are generally similar to those identified in the regulatory impactanalysis (RIA) prepared in 1982 for revisions to the NCP pursuant to section105 of CERCLA (47 FR 31180, July 16, 1982) and the economic analysis preparedwhen amendments to the NCP were proposed (50 FR 5882, February 12, 1985).This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewas required by Executive Order 12291.CostsEPA has determined that this proposed rulemaking is not a ``major'' regulationunder Executive Order 12291 because inclusion of a site on the NPL doesnot itself impose any costs. It does not establish that EPA necessarilywill undertake remedial action, nor does it require any action by a privateparty or determine its liability for site response costs. Costs that ariseout of site responses result from site-by-site decisions about what actionsto take, not directly from the act of listing itself. Nonetheless, it isuseful to consider the costs associated with responding to the sites includedin this proposed rulemaking. The major events that follow the proposed listing of a site on the NPLare a search for potentially responsible parties and a remedial investigation/feasibilitystudy (RI/FS) to determine if remedial actions will be undertaken at asite. Design and construction of the selected remedial alternative followcompletion of the RI/FS, and operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M) activitiesmay continue after construction has been completed. EPA initially bears costs associated with responsible party searches. Responsibleparties may bear some or all the costs of the RI/FS, remedial design andconstruction, and Oandamp;M, or EPA and the States may share costs. The State cost share for site cleanup activities has been amended by section104 of SARA. For privately-owned sites, as well as at publicly-owned butnot publicly-operated sites, EPA will pay for 100% of the costs of theRI/FS and remedial planning, and 90% of the costs associated with remedialaction. The State will be responsible for 10% of the remedial action. Forpublicly-operated sites, the State cost share is at least 50% of all responsecosts at the site, including the RI/FS and remedial design and constructionof the remedial action selected. After the remedy is built, costs fallinto two categories: andbullet; For restoration of ground water and surface water, EPA will sharein startup costs according to the criteria in the previous paragraph for10 years or until a sufficient level of protectiveness is achieved beforethe end of 10 years. andbullet; For other cleanups, EPA will share for up to 1 year the cost ofthat portion of response needed to assure that a remedy is operationaland functional. After that, the State assumes full responsibilities forOandamp;M. In previous NPL rulemakings, the Agency estimated the costs associatedwith these activities (RI/FS, remedial design, remedial action, and Oandamp;M)on an average per site and total cost basis. EPA will continue with thisapproach, using the most recent (1988) cost estimates available; theseestimates are presented below. However, there is wide variation in costsfor individual sites, depending on the amount, type, and extent of contamination.Additionally, EPA is unable to predict what portions of the total costsresponsible parties will bear, since the distribution of costs dependson the extent of voluntary and negotiated response and the success of anycost-recovery actions. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,10 </C>  <H1>Cost category </H1><H1>Average total cost per site\1\ </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">RI/FS <D>1,100,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Remedial Design <D>750,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Remedial Action <D>\2\13,500,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Net present value of Oandamp;M\3\ <D>\2\3,770,000 </D><F>\1\1988 U.S. Dollars. </F><F>\2\Includes State cost-share. </F><F>\3\Assumes cost of Oandamp;M over 30 years, $400,000 for the first yearand 10% discount rate. </F><F/></ITAG></ITAG>Costs to States associated with today's proposed rule arise from the requiredState cost-share of: (1) 10% of remedial actions and 10% of first-yearOandamp;M costs at privately-owned sites and sites that are publicly-ownedbut not publicly-operated; and (2) at least 50% of the remedial planning(RI/FS and remedial design), remedial action, and first-year Oandamp;M costsat publicly-operated sites. The State will assume the cost for Oandamp;Mafter EPA's period of participation. The Radium Chemical Company Site andthe Forest Glen Mobile Home Subdivision Site are both privately-owned.Therefore, using the budget projections presented above, the cost to theState of undertaking Federal remedial planning and actions, but excludingOandamp;M costs, would be approximately $2.5 million. State Oandamp;M costscannot be accurately determined because EPA, as noted above, will shareOandamp;M costs for up to 10 years for restoration of ground water and surfacewater, and it is not known if these sites will require this treatment andfor how long. However, based on past experience, EPA believes a reasonableestimate is that it will share startup costs for up to 10 years at 25%of sites. Proposing a hazardous waste site for the NPL does not itself cause firmsresponsible for the site to bear costs. Nonetheless, a listing may inducefirms to clean up the sites voluntarily, or it may act as a potential triggerfor subsequent enforcement or cost-recovery actions. Such actions may imposecosts on firms, but the decisions to take such actions are discretionaryand made on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, precise estimates of theseeffects cannot be made. EPA does not believe that every site will be cleanedup by a responsible party. EPA cannot project at this time which firmsor industry sectors will bear specific portions of the response costs,but the Agency considers: the volume and nature of the waste at the sites;the strength of the evidence linking the wastes at the site to the parties;the parties' ability to pay; and other factors when deciding whether andhow to proceed against the parties. Economy-wide effects of this proposed amendment to the NCP are aggregationsof effects on firms and State and local governments. Although effects couldbe felt by some individual firms and States, the total impact of this proposalon output, prices, and employment is expected to be negligible at the nationallevel, as was the case in the 1982 RIA.<T3>Benefits</T3> The benefits associated with today's proposal to place the Radium ChemicalCompany Site and the Forest Glen Mobile Home Site on the NPL are increasedhealth and environmental protection as a result of increased public awarenessof potential hazards. In addition to the potential for more Federally-financedremedial actions, expansion of the NPL can accelerate privately-financed,voluntary cleanup efforts. Proposing sites as national priority targetsalso may give States increased support for funding responses at particularsites. As a result of additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower human exposureto high-risk chemicals, and higher-quality surface water, ground water,soil, and air. These benefits are expected to be significant, althoughdifficult to estimate in advance of completing the RI/FS at this site.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires EPA to review the impactsof this action on small entities, or certify that the action will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. By smallentities, the Act refers to small businesses, small government jurisdictions,and nonprofit organizations. While this rule proposes revisions to the NCP, they are not typical regulatorychanges since the revisions do not authomatically impose costs. Proposingsites on the NPL does not in itself require any action by any private party,nor does it determine the liability of any party for the cost of cleanupat the site. Further, no identifiable groups are affected as a whole. Asa consequence, it is hard to predict impacts on any group. A site's proposedinclusion on the NPL could increase the likelihood that adverse impactsto responsible parties (in the form of cleanup costs) will occur, but EPAcannot identify the potentially affected business at this time nor estimatethe number of small businesses that might be affected. The Agency does expect that certain industries and firms within industriesthat have caused a proportionately high percentage of waste site problemscould be significantly affected by CERCLA actions. However, EPA does notexpect the impacts from the listing of these sites to have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. In any case, economic impacts would only occur through enforcement andcost-recovery actions, which are taken at EPA's discretion on a site-by-sitebasis. EPA considers many factors when determining what enforcement actionsto take, including not only the firm's contribution to the problem, butalso the firm's ability to pay. The impacts (from cost recovery) on small governments and nonprofit organizationswould be determined on a similar case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 300 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Chemicals, Hazardous materials, Intergovernmentalrelations, Natural resources, Oil pollution, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Superfund, Waste treatement and disposal, Water pollutioncontrol, Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert L.
