<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-0153 </DOCNO><TEXT>A technique is presented for solving the equations describing the current,concentration, and potential distributions in an undivided laminar-flow-channelelectrochemical reactor. The equations account for multiple electrochemicalreactions, interacting boundary layers, and both axial and normal variationsof current, concentration, and potential. Migration as a specific fluxcomponent is not taken into account, but ohmic potential drop is. Thegoverning equations are solved using orthogonal collocation extendedwith an additional set of functions that match the singular behaviornear the electrode edges. Thus the method is more accurate than conventionalorthogonal collocation, especially for primary and limiting current distributions.Potential distributions calculated by this method show that even fora small aspect ratio (h/L=0.1), the axial variation of potential mustbe included in the equations.</TEXT></DOC>
