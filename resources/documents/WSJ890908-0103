Some 70% of white voters cast ballots for parties that favor extending some form of political rights to blacks.    There is still serious disagreement over what type of democracy South Africa should adopt. The African National Congress insists on a one-man, one-vote system to decide who will control the all-powerful federal government, one of the world's most centralized. But moderate whites and blacks say any arrangement that grants absolute power to whatever group has a majority is a recipe for dictatorship: &quot;One man, one vote, once.&quot;    They point out that the ruling National Party imposed apartheid after winning only 42% of white votes in the 1948 election, and with the help of skillful gerrymandering it has never lost since. In almost every other African nation, the lack of effective protection for minorities has resulted in dictatorship, where even black minorities are often brutally oppressed.    The most significant aspect of this election was the extent to which the winning National Party gave up any pretense of trying to woo pro-apartheid whites. Its election platform called for a &quot;great indaba,&quot; or negotiation over power-sharing, full economic freedom for blacks and a new constitution. There was no mention of &quot;group rights,&quot; a code word for continued white domination.    The National Party's gamble paid off, and it managed to win a reduced majority. Pro-apartheid parties saw their vote stagnate at about 30%. In contrast, the pro-reform, free-market Democratic Party increased its share to 20%.    White leaders are now discussing a radical decentralization of the national government as a means of ensuring security for all of South Africa's polyglot populations. Many political decisions would be made at the local level -- as in the United States -- including those involving public education, police and the courts. &quot;The Solution,&quot; a best-selling book by Frances Kendall and Leon Louw, goes further and proposes largely limiting the national government's powers to defense and the protection of rights.    Many blacks are also rethinking their politics. Aggrey Klaaste, editor of the Sowetan, the nation's largest black newspaper, wants freedom, but he told Reason magazine he has come to distrust political power in Africa&quot; -- a continent red with blood.&quot; He favors black economic empowerment, and has launched a campaign to create a network of private institutions through which blacks can acquire economic muscle and freedom that &quot;no government, black or white, can take from us.&quot;    Key to Mr. Klaaste's vision is the black &quot;informal sector&quot; of street traders, taxi owners and backyard shops that may represent 20% of the nation's economy. Mr. Klaaste says economic empowerment is helping to undermine apartheid, even in housing. He points out that black buying power now exceeds that of whites; consumer boycotts have recently ground to a halt the towns that refused to abolish some apartheid laws.    Meanwhile, the sanction strategy is losing support. In May, the respected Gallup Poll found that 85% of South African blacks now oppose sanctions, and 59% believe the presence of U.S. companies helps break down apartheid. After the tumult of recent years, it's clear that a quiet, largely unnoticed revolution in thinking is taking place in South Africa. </TEXT></DOC>
