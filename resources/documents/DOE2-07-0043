This virtual orbital is used in multiconfigurationalcalculations with mixtures of five configurations sp + dp for j = 1,in order to obtain the hyperfine electronic constant (r/sup -3/){mu}{upsilon} with {mu} {upsilon} = 10,01,12,02 (using the effective operator)or the /sup 3/P/sub 1/ level of calcium and the hyperfine (HFS) constantA(/sup 3/P/sub 1/) of barium.</TEXT></DOC>
