<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-0720 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using a functional-integral method we show that the two-dimensional Hubbardmodel coupled weakly in the third dimension has a superconducting solutionfor the non-half-filled band case. The superconducting critical temperatureis determined by the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature. This temperatureincreases with the coupling to the third dimension and with the holeconcentrations. The critical behavior is similar to that of a three-dimensionaltype-II superconductor.</TEXT></DOC>
