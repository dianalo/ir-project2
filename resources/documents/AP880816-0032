DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan, in an emotional valedictoryspeech to the Republican National Convention, told cheeringdelegates Monday that contrary to Democratic claims, George Bush``was there.'' To his vice president, he said, ``Win one for theGipper.''   Acknowledging the tumultuous reception, Reagan declared,``Nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the delegates in thishall, except maybe a victory celebration on Nov. 8,'' the presidentsaid.   ``In this spirit,'' Reagan told the delegates, ``I think wecould be forgiven if we give ourselves a little pat on the back forhaving made Republican a proud word again and America a proudnation again.''   Bush, praised by Reagan as a man ``who has seen this office fromthe inside,'' watched the president's speech on television at thevice presidential residence in Washington. He will arrive in theconvention city Tuesday, one day before his coronation as theRepublican presidential nominee.   After Reagan spoke, Bush said in a statement, ``It was a greatand generous speech by a great and generous president. Barbara andI were very touched and very moved. Now I will go to New Orleans,spell out my message for America and do my level best to fill thebig shoes of Ronald Reagan.''   The president spoke forcefully, generally in serious tones.There was an occasional scratchiness in his voice. But there werelighter moments, too, such as when he invoked his old movie careerto urge Bush to victory.   Reagan's final words, ``God bless America,'' touched off atumultuous demonstration on the floor, which erupted in evengreater cheering as he was joined on the podium by the first lady.   In the climax of the evening, red, white and blue balloons werereleased from the Superdome ceiling, and the Reagans playfullyswatted them around the podium and into the swell of delegates.   Blue, white and red ``Bush '88'' signs were hoisted into theair, and one delegate sported a ``Reagan for VP '88'' placard. Bushstill has not made known his choice for a running mate.   Seeking to counter the ``Where was George?'' cry that became atheme of the Democratic National Convention, Reagan told theconvention, ``George played a major role in everything that we'veaccomplished.''   When he belted out the line, ``And George was there,'' the crowdroared back, ``Four more years, four more years.''   He then ticked off a list of administration successes, from theeconomic recovery to the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate medium-andshort-range nuclear weapons. ``Without George Bush to build onthose policies, everything we have achieved will be at risk,''Reagan said.   ``We need someone who's big enough and experienced enough tohandle tough and demanding negotiations with ... (Soviet leaderMikhail) Gorbachev _ because this is no time to gamble withon-the-job training.''   It was clear who Reagan was referring to, although he did notmention by name the Democratic presidential nominee, MichaelDukakis.   There was a brief chant of ``Reagan, Reagan, Reagan'' from thecrowd after the president declared that ``in the 2,765 days of ouradministration, not one inch of ground has fallen to theCommunists.''   There was a chorus of booing when Reagan predicted that if theDemocrats win the election ``their answer will be the one they haverelied on in the past _ and that is higher taxes.''   In domestic policy, Reagan said, ``we set out to reduce federalregulations that had been imposed on the people, on businesses, andon local and state governments.''   ``And George was there,'' he said of the Republican presidentialnominee-in-waiting. ``He headed up the task force that eliminatedthose regulations.''   ``So, George, I'm in your corner,'' he said.   Then, invoking a movie line that has become one of his politicaltrademarks, the president said, ``But George, just one personalrequest: go out there and win one for the Gipper.''   He grinned broadly.   The president insisted on the timing of his convention speech _on opening night _ to avoid stealing the spotlight from Bush.   Reagan and his vice president are scheduled to meet only once inthis convention city, at a ceremonial passing of the baton at theNew Orleans airport Tuesday when Bush arrives for his coronationand the president and Nancy Reagan depart for a California vacation.   Mrs. Reagan preceded her husband on the podium. Her briefremarks were followed by a film highlighting the key moments of theReagan presidency.   Reagan told the delegates: ``I'm grateful to God for blessing mewith a good life and a long one. But when I pack my bags inWashington, don't expect me to be happy to hear all this talk aboutthe twilight of my life.''   ``Together, we've fought for causes we love,'' he said. ``But wecan never let the fire go out or quit the fight, because the battleis never over.''   And he used a reference to his beloved Rancho del Cielo todescribe what lies ahead for the nation.   ``There's still a lost of brush to clear out at the ranch,fences that need repair and horses to ride.''   The president said his administration was able to forge ahead onboth the international and domestic fronts ``in spite of theresistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that it'stime for a change.''   ``They resisted our defense buildup; they resisted our tax cuts;they resisted cutting the fat out of government; and they resistedour appointments of judges committed to the law and theConstitution.''   ``Facts are stubborn things,'' the president said repeatedly,declaring that it was his administration that led the country intoits longest peacetime economic expansion and reversed Democraticpolicies that produced ``gas lines as well as unemployment lines.''   Reagan opened his speech by telling the delegates that he andthe first lady wanted ``to share a little of your special time.''   ``Having temporary custody of this office has been for me asacred trust and an honor beyond words or measure,'' he said.   Earlier Monday, Reagan made a surprise appearance at a luncheongiven in honor of the first lady.   ``I really can't imagine these last eight years without Nancy,''Reagan said. ``Every president should be so lucky.''   ``She once said that the president has all kinds of advisers andexperts to look after his interests when it comes to foreignpolicy, the economy or whatever, but no one to look after his needsas a human being,'' he said. ``Well, Nancy has done that.''   Mrs. Reagan, clearly surprised at the president's appearance andmoist-eyed at the tribute, put her arms around him as he spoke andas they joined the audience in singing, ``America, the Beautiful.''   She told the luncheon that the years she and her husband spentin the White House were ``eight of the most wonderful years we haveever had.''   But, she added, ``Today the curtain begins to close on theReagan era of the Republican party. We have had a wonderful run,but today it is time for the Bushes to step into the politicalleading roles and for the Reagans to step into the wings.''</TEXT></DOC>
