No one quote could describe John Engelman's piece on crimeand the Supreme Court (It seems to me, Sept. 27) any better than that one.;  To suggest that an increasingly conservative Supreme Court has beenresponsible for a safer America over the last decade is wrong for two reasons:First, suggesting that the Supreme Court would have any effect on crime isboth simplistic and ridiculous. Second, Engelman's selective misuse ofstatistics notwithstanding, America has not become a safer place.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CONSERVATIVE COURT HASN'T CUT CRIME RATE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     Engelman's contention is based on the fact the murder and burglary rateswere lower by the end of the decade than in 1980. While this is true, itshould also be pointed out that according to the same FBI statistics theoverall violent crime (murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault) rate wasactually 11.1 percent higher in 1989 than in 1980.;   Engelman's arbitrary useof the entire 1980s as a time reference is also misleading. Most categories ofcrime had bottomed out between 1983 and 1985, since which time crime rateshave steadily increased. A more meaningful comparison would be between theyears 1985 and 1989. During this time period, overall crime increased 10.3percent, with property crime increasing 9.2 percent and violent crimeincreasing 19.1 percent. Specifically, murder and non-negligent manslaughterincreased 10.1 percent, robbery increased 11.8 percent, larceny theftincreased 9.3 percent, and forcible rape increased 2.7 percent. I do notrecall the Supreme Court becoming any less conservative during this time.;  Making America safer, contrary to the assertions of John Engelman and otherslike him, is not a simple proposition. There are many things that can causecriminal behavior, and all of them must be recognized and addressed before wecan feel safer. Simple solutions to the &quot;crime problem&quot; are not solutions atall, and only serve to make the problem worse. Simplistic reasoning,accompanied by over-simplistic statistical analysis, leads only to simplisticsolutions.;   -- Scott I.
