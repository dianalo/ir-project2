In additionto traditional methods, scientists are using recent advances such as recombinantDNA and cell fusion to develop new varieties of agricultural crops. Recently,field tests have been conducted on certain genetically modified (i.e.,transgenic) plants that have been engineered to be insect or disease resistantor to be tolerant to herbicides. These field tests have been limited insize and scope and have been conducted for the purpose of obtaining efficacydata prior to large scale planting. In addition, agricultural researchprograms are under way to improve the nutritional quality of food cropsand to develop commercial crops with other desirable characteristics. Because of the rapid progress of science and the public focus on biotechnology,the United States Department of Agriculture via the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Food andDrug Administration are jointly sponsoring a conferece on scientific issuesassociated with transgenic plants that are intended to be used for foodand other commercial purposes. The conference will provide an opportunityfor participants from government, academia, industry, consumer and environmentalgroups to discuss the current scientific issues regarding such plants.The conference format will include presentations by scientific expertsin the various fields related to research and development of transgenicplants. Small interactive work group sessions will provide an opportunityfor participants to further discuss the scientific issues associated withthese plants.   Attendance will be limited to available space. Notices of the meeting havebeen sent to prospective participants representing industry, academia,and consumer and environmental interest groups. However, a limited numberof openings have been reserved for other interested persons with similarexpertise. Interested persons should contact one of the persons listedunder <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.''</T2> Summaries of the proceedingsfrom the conference will be available after the conference and may be obtainedby contacting one of the persons listed under <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.''</T2>  The following are examples of issues that will be addressed at the conference. 1. What kinds of transgenic plants are being developed, and what techniquesare being used in their development?  2. What aspects of the techniques of molecular biology may raise issuessuch as the possibility of transfer of genetic material to unintended hosts? 3. What issues should be addressed in assessing possible effects on humanhealth?  4. What genetic alterations in the plant might lead to the creation orintroduction of new pests or to enhanced susceptibility to existing pests? 5. What isues should be addressed in assessing the effects on the environmentof transgenic plants?<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 19, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
