(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Though the Monsanto Chemical Co. planthere sports a new device to ``scrub'' pollutants from its emissions,company officials say that's not enough to reach their goal of a 90percent reduction in air discharges.   Monsanto, like a growing number of companies, says it now mustconcentrate on reducing pollutants before they come out of itsplants by using and producing less toxic materials in the firstplace.   ``This is the wave of the future, the whole notion of preventingpollution rather than continually seeing ourselves in the positionof having to clean it up,'' said Margie Alt, toxics program directorfor the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.   Massachusetts and Oregon passed laws last month requiringindustries to work to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals they use.Similar bills are being pushed in the legislatures of California andNew Jersey.   The challenge, says Greenpeace toxics campaign director DaveRapaport, ``is not disposal, but how not to generate waste in thefirst place.''   Noting that waste reduction makes good economic sense in a timeof soaring disposal costs, companies like Monsanto say they'realready doing the best they can to use and make less hazardousmaterials.   Monsanto has declared a goal of reducing air emissions by 90percent by 1992 and solid waste by 70 percent by 1995. Du Pontquickly followed suit, announcing its own ambitious waste reductiongoals.   It is the idea of mandatory, government-ordered steps that irksthe petrochemical plants that line the Delaware River south ofPhiladelphia.   Chemists and plant managers are wary of legislators forcing themto tinker with the delicate reactions and processes that produceeverything from pharmaceuticals to vinyl floor coverings.   The Monsanto Bridgeport plant makes ``plasticizers,'' basicbuilding blocks for a host of products. They are made from benzylchloride, the fruit of a chemical reaction between toluene andchlorine, hazardous substances that are mixed in a vacuum chamber inprecise amounts.   Besides the desired product, the process yields an unwanted toxicresidue.   ``Believe me, we've been working very hard to reduce that,'' saidDonald Hoegel, a Monsanto environmental specialist. ``We reallydon't want to make it. ... But it's very hard not to.''   So far, Monsanto chemists haven't figured out a way. Yet under abill pending in the New Jersey Legislature, the state would notaccept no for an answer anymore. The proposal would force thestate's industries to reduce their use of hazardous materials andproduction of hazardous waste by 50 percent over five years.   The California Legislature, meanwhile, is considering a bill torequire industries to develop source-reduction plans. To help,legislators propose establishment of a hazardous waste reductioninstitute in the state's university system.   The Massachusetts bill passed with one-sided votes after a rarebit of cooperation between the environmental community and abusiness coalition.   ``There are a lot of companies that want to get ahead ofenvironmental issues and not just react to them,'' said Jim Segal, alawyer and former state legislator who represented the businesscoalition.   But at the Monsanto plant here _ which produces less than oneunit of waste for every 100 units of product _ reducing toxicbyproducts by half in a few years could prove impossible, Hoegelsays.   ``It's very hard to dictate a fixed number for reduction becauseit's very much dependent on the chemical process itself,'' he said.``If you're already very efficient, to get that extra little bit outmay be absolutely infeasible.''   In the case of pharmaceutical makers, all-important U.S. Food andDrug Administration approval hinges on a product's precisechemistry. Altering the process to make less waste may harmfullyalter the product, said Hal Bozarth, a lobbyist for New Jersey'spowerful chemical industry.   But environmental leaders in New Jersey say it isn't good enoughto trust industry's pace or good intentions.   ``It's great that some companies out there are pursuing (toxicsreduction) aggressively, but without legislation there's no wayyou're going to make this happen in a comprehensive manner,'' saidLincoln Bormann, environmental advocate for New Jersey PIRG.   Bormann says it's hardly a coincidence that shellfish from theindustry-heavy lower Delaware are unfit for human consumption.Decades of industrial discharges have left sediments laden withchemicals and altered the mix of plants and animals in the river.   ``While Monsanto may be setting a goal, there are a lot ofcompanies that aren't,'' he said. ``I think the fact New Jersey hasthe worst water quality in the country speaks for itself.''</TEXT></DOC>
