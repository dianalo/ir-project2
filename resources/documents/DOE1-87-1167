These companies producea broad range of manufactured chemicals for domestic and export markets.This report represents 75% of the total chemical industry. The surveyincludes costs of fuel and electricity. The cost of feedstocks is notincluded in the survey because the reporting methodology treats any improvementsin raw material conversion rates as total plant efficiency gains andtherefore as improvements in the utilization of fuels. Outline is givenof the various types of improvements undertaken in the industry. Thesehave tended to include activities that focus on combustion and steamdistribution systems, increased fuel switching to minimize total operatingcosts, cogeneration, byproduct utilization, and upgrading of distillationequipment. Some case studies are presented. Energy conservation activitieshave resulted in a total improvement in energy efficiency up to 1986of 34.4% based on the 1972 base year. 1 fig., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
