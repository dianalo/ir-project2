The Democratic leader has been trying to shake the dust off two decade-old nuclear-test-limitation treaties and win Senate ratification for them. But to show that Democrats are as concerned as Republicans about preventing Soviet cheating, he favors adding language to the pacts designed to assure that the U.S. could verify Soviet compliance.    Arms-control experts applaud Sen. Byrd's motives but say his methods are so wrongheaded that he is doing their cause more harm than good. They complain that the Democrats, in their eagerness to gain momentum on foreign policy, have taken treaties that both the U.S. and Soviets have abided by anyway -- and that don't limit tests in any meaningful way -- and have put them through a confusing process that could result in a long Senate fight and even unnecessary superpower negotiations.    &quot;It is really much ado about nothing,&quot; says Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.), who wants arms control but believes that working over these two old treaties puts the Senate in a quagmire.    By letting themselves get tied up in a debate over meaningless treaties, Sen. Byrd and his fellow party members are leaving President Reagan more political running room on arms control than he was expected to get when the Senate changed hands last fall. That affects the foreign-policy, as well as the domestic-political, equation. Unless the Democrats get their act together, Mr. Reagan will remain in a strong position to pursue his hard-line approach in negotiations with the Soviets, who must have hoped that pressure from the left would complicate the Reagan bargaining posture.    &quot;Why didn't they {the Democrats} just leave the whole thing alone?&quot; asks Paul Warnke, a leading arms controller for President Carter. &quot;It's absolutely absurd, and a serious setback to the negotiating process.&quot;    Mr. Warnke notes that former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and Republican Presidents Nixon and Ford all believed both sides could verify compliance adequately. And since the 1970s, the U.S. capability to monitor Soviet compliance has improved substantially.    The treaties are the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. All the layman need know about them is that they haven't prevented either side from testing anything it really wanted -- a fact that explains why arms-control advocates never liked the treaties.    Last year, President Reagan consented to submit the languishing treaties for Senate ratification if legislators would free his hands in negotiating with the Soviets in Iceland. That's when matters got messy. The administration said it wanted a double ratification process. First, the Senate would ratify the two treaties with new verification language. Then, Mr. Reagan would have to renegotiate the treaties with the Soviets, who would have to agree to the new provisions.    Under that approach, the amended treaties would have to go back to the Senate for another ratification vote. But the pacts might never reach that stage: Many diplomatic observers believe Moscow would refuse to renegotiate issues long since considered resolved -- on treaties that are outdated, anyway.    Sen. Kassebaum and Sen. Daniel Evans (R., Wash) proposed a face-saving formula: that the Senate endorse the treaties but withhold action on ratification until verification procedures are negotiated.    That probably would have ended the Senate's agony over the treaties, because arms negotiators are unlikely to set aside work on a new accord to hammer out terms for verifying outmoded ones. But Sen. Byrd wouldn't have it, even though it is clear that his plan doesn't have a chance of winning the two-thirds majority needed for ratification.    So what started out as arms control has become a question of personal prestige. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), unable to reconcile the two approaches, last week persuaded his committee to send both treaties to the Senate floor and leave it to legislators to decide.    Ironically, arms-control backers now find themselves in the curious position of opposing Democrats, who most often are their allies. &quot;We would prefer to see no action,&quot; says John Isaacs of the Council for a Liveable World, a nuclear-arms-control lobby.    Mr. Warnke says watching Sen. Byrd and his troops take on arms control reminds him of baseball great Casey Stengel's comments upon seeing his ill-fated 1962 New York Mets.    Quotes Mr. Warnke: &quot;Can't anybody here play this game?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
