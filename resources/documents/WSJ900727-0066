In the past two months alone, LBO powerhouse KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co. agreed to sell its Beatrice Co. toConAgra Inc. for $1.34 billion and Motel 6 L.P. to France'sAccor S.A. for $1.3 billion.</LP><TEXT>   In April, KKR sold 10% of Safeway Stores Inc. to thepublic in a $112.5 million stock offering.   And last week, Forstmann Little andamp; Co. agreed to sell MoenInc. to American Brands Inc. for $975 million.   That could be only the tip of the iceberg. From 1981 to1989, LBO funds and their pension-fund investors tookhundreds of companies private in a buy-out binge totalingmore than $250 billion.   One reason the companies are so ripe for sale, either tothe public or corporate acquirers, is that LBO funds areanxious to sell to generate returns for their investors.That's unlike publicly traded corporations, where managementsoften resist takeover bids to avoid losing their jobs.   Some buy-out funds executives make no bones about theirkeen interest in selling some of their holdings in comingmonths.   Brian Little, a founding partner of Forstmann Little, saysbuy-out funds typically &quot;start thinking about taking aprofit&quot; within a few years, once they have made any plannedchanges in a company and paid down buy-out debt sufficientlyto generate a healthy return.   Now that Forstmann has agreed to sell Moen, he said:&quot;We've got two or three other companies which we think overthe next 12 months could also be sold. Our business isacquiring assets, helping make them worth more, and sellingthem.&quot;   Wall Street's investment bankers are licking their chopsover more deals in the offing. &quot;Every investment bank has alist,&quot; says Steven Rattner, general partner at Lazard Freresandamp; Co.   One reason for buy-out firms to strike now is thestill-buoyant stock market, which despite this week'sweakness remains within 80 points of the 3000 mark on the DowJones Industrial Average. That should enable buy-out fundoperators to seek substantial prices for their treasure troveof companies, whether in a public offering or from acorporate buyer.   However, what still isn't clear is whether there aresufficient buyers to go around. Stock-market investors havebeen penalizing companies that still carry a heavy debt load,as they did with KKR's offering of Safeway shares. KKR had toslash the offering price 22% from the midrange of itsoriginal estimated sale price.   But whether or not the buyers are ready, there is a bulgein the number of private companies ready for sale. ScottNewquist, head of investment banking at Kidder, Peabody andamp;Co., says buy-outs typically generate the highest annualrates of return for their investors over a three-to-five-yearperiod. The flurry of sales is occurring now, he says,because &quot;we're at a time three to five years from when a lotof buy-outs were done.&quot;   James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,a leveraged buy-out fund, says: &quot;If you look at the burst ofLBOs that were done in 1984-1987, there are a lot of dealsthat should be ripe for the plucking.&quot;   However, other fund operators argue -- perhaps partly as anegotiating posture -- that they aren't in a hurry to sell.&quot;You may see some more {sales by buy-out funds} because thestock market is relatively strong,&quot; says KKR partner HenryKravis. &quot;But if we don't get the right price, we're not underthe gun to do anything.&quot;   One LBO manager maintains: &quot;If you talk to our partnersand you said to them, would you rather get a quick 60% to 70%annual return in one or two years, or would you rather havelong-term annual returns of 30%, my guess is they'd pick the30%.&quot;   Joseph L. Rice, president of LBO firm Clayton andamp; Dubilier,attributes the recent burst of sales to &quot;just chance.&quot; Hedoesn't think there is any particular holding period thatwill maximize investor returns. &quot;If you have a business thatis performing well, sooner or later something good is goingto happen to you,&quot; he says.   Nevertheless, Lazard's Mr. Rattner says buy-out funds havegood reason to seize an opportunity to cash out. &quot;For peoplewho want to raise new funds in this suspicious environment inwhich we live, it's important to show investors profits. Andone thing you certainly learn watching the events of the lastyear or two: things that at one instant look like spectaculardeals can quickly look not so spectacular.&quot;   One buy-out fund executive, who asked not to beidentified, notes that Forstmann and KKR have spent more thanhalf of their current buy-out funds and may want to post somehefty return rates on some buy-outs as they prepare to seeknew investment dollars.   KKR declined to comment. Forstmann's Mr. Little said thatany potential plans to raise more money &quot;are not a factor&quot; inthe timing of company sales.   In seeking buyers, fund operators' first choice isgenerally U.S. or foreign corporations with deep pockets.Leon Kalvaria, a managing director at First Boston Corp.,says that corporate acquirers will generally pay a higherprice for any given company than a public stock offeringwould attract. The reason, he says, is &quot;a strategic buyer iswilling to pay a premium price&quot; to gain control of an entirecompany.   But another category of buyer -- other LBO funds -- hasfaded, due to weakness in the market of high-risk, high-yieldjunk bonds whose sale typically used to finance about 30% ofa buy-out. After KKR bought Beatrice in 1986, several of thefood company's larger pieces were sold to other LBO funds,notes Lazard's Mr. Rattner.   ---         Cashing Out: LBO Resales Are On the Rise                                                                                                                                         BUY-OUT   COMPANY NAME    BUY-OUT FIRM   DATE        OUTCOME                                                                                                          Safeway Stores   KKR           1986    10% stake sold to                                          public April 1990                                                                                                          Stanadyne        Forstmann     1988    Renamed Moen; sale                    Little                to american Brands                                          announced in July                                          1990                                                                                                          Motel 6          KKR           1985    Sale to French                                          hotel chain                                          announced in July                                          1990                                                                                                          Beatrice         KKR           1986    Broken up; sale of                                          last piece to                                          ConAgra announced                                          in June                                                                                                          First Brands     First Boston, 1986    Sold 20% to public                    Met Life              in December 1989;                                          entire company put                                          up for sale in                                          June</TEXT></DOC>
