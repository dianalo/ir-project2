SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   By the time they reach middle age, Americansborn today could be sharing the planet with twice the currentnumber of people, a private population research group reportedWednesday.   The world's population, which edged past the 5 billion mark justa year ago, could double within 40 years, the Population ReferenceBureau said in its annual ``World Population Data Sheet.''   ``We've been noticing for a couple of years now that the overallgrowth trend has not been following the standard projections ...,''Carl Haub, an analyst for the bureau, said in a telephone interview.   The anticipated decline in birth rates in many less-developednations has not been as great as hoped, he said, and ``it is likelythat the sixth billion (person) will be added in just 10 moreyears.''   While projecting the world's population into the future requiresassumptions about birth rates, Haub noted that the globalpopulation has been rising faster than previously anticipated.   It took all of human history to raise the world's population to1 billion, which occurred in the early 1800s _ during thepresidency of Thomas Jefferson.   More than a century was required to add the second billion,which occurred about 1930, according to the United Nations Fund forPopulation Activities. The population rose to 3 billion by 1964, 4billion in 1974 and 5 billion in 1987.   The next billion could be added by 1998, said Haub.   There is a perception that world population growth is a problemof the 1970s, Haub observed, ``so we thought it was time to pointout that it's still growing faster than had been projected.''   The bureau's data sheet shows worldwide population growing at1.7 percent annually. The United Nations had projected growth of1.6 percent.   ``That doesn't sound like much,'' Haub said, but in a world of 5billion inhabitants, the difference represents 5 million morepeople per year.   Population growth hasn't followed the smooth trend downward thathad been expected in many deceloping nations, Haub said. He notedin particular that China, India, Pakistan and Iran have high growthrates.   ``Some of the larger countries have not followed a nice smoothpath to the two-child family that we have been predicting,'' saidHaub. He pointed in particular to China and India, where previousreductions in births have not been maintained.   The doubling of the world population in 40 years depends ongrowth continuing at 1.7 percent, a rate that varies considerablyfrom country to country and region to region, Haub said.   The more developed nations, for example, are growing at 0.6percent annually, for an anticipated doubling time of 120 years,the data sheet shows. On the other hand, the less-developed nationscould double in just 33 years, at a growth rate of 2.1 percent.   Increasing fastest are Kenya and the disputed territory of Gaza,currently occupied by Israel, each of which is expected to doubleits population in just 17 years at current rates of increase.   At the other end of the scale, five countries are not growing atall _ Austria, Denmark, Hungary, East Germany and West Germany. AndItaly, at its current rate, would not double its population for3,465 years.   Changes are hard to anticipate as various nations progresseconomically toward what population experts call the demographictransition.   In early societies, high birth rates are generally balanced byhigh death rates. As economic conditions provide better medicalcare and nutrition, death rates fall while birth rates remain high,leading to rapid population growth.   Eventually, history shows, birth rates also begin to fall in atransition to balance again, as has happened in many more developednations.   Social, religions and other differences among nations, however,keep this change from being a smooth curve and help lead to themany variations around the world.</TEXT></DOC>
