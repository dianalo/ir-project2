<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-0626 </DOCNO><TEXT>An appreciation is presented of the factors which influence fracture propagationin the immediate roof of the longwall, the strata-control function ofthe powered support in typical European geological conditions being torestrict that propagation and so maintain competent roof over the facearea. When mining under massive sandstone roofs however, the controlof fracture propagation may require greater support densities than currentlyavailable. An appropriate two-stage predictive capability for such conditionsis described. In the first stage, a finite element model is used to predictthe maximum block size that is generated on mining under massive sandstone,results showing that the forward edge of the block is formed by a tensilefracture generated ahead of the face. In the second stage, the supportrating required to inhibit the rotation of that block is determined,treating the support as an elastic foundation with a modulus relatedto the closure characteristics of the legs. 4 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
