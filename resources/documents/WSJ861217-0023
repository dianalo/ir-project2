Some long-term Treasury bonds rose about one-quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. However, interest rates on short-term Treasury bills rose slightly, reflecting the continued high level of the federal funds rate.    Investors have been focusing intently on oil price developments. Yesterday, oil prices slumped as OPEC members unexpectedly postponed a scheduled meeting in Geneva until today.    &quot;Oil is a symbol of inflation in the minds of many people,&quot; said A. Gary Shilling, president of an economic forecasting and investment strategy firm bearing his name. &quot;I think it's overdone, but the markets sure have gotten the jitters lately&quot; as oil producers appeared to be nearing an accord to cut production, he said.    Inflation will rise only moderately next year, according to many analysts. Even if oil producers succeed in cutting production this winter, they won't be able to prop up oil prices next spring, some forecasters contend.    &quot;The real test will come in the spring when seasonal oil needs are much lower,&quot; said Alan C. Lerner, senior vice president and money market economist at Bankers Trust Co. He said there is a &quot;very good chance that we could see another signficant decline in oil prices&quot; next spring. Mr. Lerner predicts interest rates will move lower next year.    Henry Kaufman, chief economist of Salomon Brothers Inc., predicts sharp declines in interest rates early next year, followed by increases later. &quot;A sluggish economy will trigger at least one more discount rate cut&quot; by the Federal Reserve System, he contended in a 69-page report released yesterday afternoon. The discount rate, now 5 1/2%, is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    Mr. Kaufman contended that 30-year Treasury bond yields, now about 7 3/8%, &quot;will approach 6 1/2% before midyear.&quot; Later, though, &quot;a weaker dollar and evidence of slowly accelerating inflation will raise concerns&quot; among investors both here and abroad, driving up yields on long-term Treasury issues to about 7 3/4%. He also contended that the economy will expand only about 2% next year, compared with &quot;just over 2 1/2%&quot; in 1986.    Bond prices showed little reaction to Mr. Kaufman's latest forecasts. Many other economists already have expressed similar views about the economic and interest-rate outlook.    A year ago, Mr. Kaufman was overly optimistic about prospects for faster economic growth in 1986. At that time, he predicted the economy would expand 3.5% this year. He correctly predicted that interest rates would decline early in 1986, but he also contended long-term bond yields would surge later in the year as much as 1 1/4 percentage points from their lows.    In the credit markets, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 rose slightly to 101 12/32 from 101 5/32 Monday. That trimmed the yield to 7.38% from 7.4%. In mid-April, similar issues traded at prices to yield about 7 1/8%.    The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose to 101 29/32 from 100 25/32 from 100 29/32 Monday. That lowered the yield to 7.12% from 7.14%.    Among short-term securities, the latest 13-week Treasury bill rate closed on some quotation sheets at 5.59% bid. That compared with an average rate of 5.55% at Monday's auction. The latest 26-week Treasury bill closed at 5.58% bid, unchanged from the auction average.    Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. economists expect &quot;modest further declines&quot; in interest rates during 1987. In its quarterly publication, Morgan Guaranty also predicted lackluster economic growth next year.    Morgan Guaranty's economists expect a 2.5% increase in economic growth in 1987, after adjusting for inflation. That would be about the same as the 2.6% growth it estimates for this year.    &quot;Continued pressure from U.S. policymakers for internationally coordinated interest-rate reductions, along with sluggish economic growth and modest inflation, could well encourage the Fed to continue to stimulate the supply of credit -- leading to further declines in interest rates,&quot; the Morgan Guaranty report concluded.    In the corporate market, several large new issues were offered to investors. These included $300 million of Texas Utilities Electric Co. first mortgage bonds, due Dec. 1, 2016. The 9 1/2% bonds were priced at 98.375 to yield 9.67%. Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. headed the underwriting group. The issue is rated single-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and triple-B-plus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Separately, a $250 million issue of Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. first and refunding mortgage bonds was offered through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley. The 8.65% bonds were priced after auction at 96.125 to yield 9.02% to maturity Jan. 1, 2020. They are rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    A two-part, $200 million package of USG Corp. notes was offered through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers. The offering consisted of $100 million of 7 3/8% notes due in five years and $100 million of 8% notes due in 10 years. The 7 3/8% notes were priced at 99.60 to yield 7.472%, while the 8% issue was priced at 99.60 to yield 8.059%. Both portions are rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A by Sandamp;P.    On the tax-exempt front, a $103 million offering of various purpose general obligation bonds by Pennsylvania got off to a brisk start. By some estimates, only about $24 million of the bonds remained unsold among underwriters as of yesterday afternoon. A group led by Citicorp Investment Bank priced the bonds to yield from 4.2% in 1988 to 6.75% in 2006. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and double-A-minus by Sandamp;P. </TEXT></DOC>
