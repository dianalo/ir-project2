Nynex said the charge, which had been expected byanalysts, will reduce its 1991 earnings by about $2.73 ashare and will lead to a substantial loss in the fourthquarter. In last year's fourth quarter Nynex would haveearned $271.7 million, or $1.36 a share, but a $211 millioncharge reduced earnings to $60.7 million, or 30 cents ashare. In fact, the latest charge will be Nynex's thirdfourth-quarter charge in three years.                                                                                                          In addition, the company said 6,500 craft employees,including unionized operators, technicians and officeworkers, have asked to leave the company by the end of theyear under an early retirement program announced inSeptember.   Nynex's plan prompted Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. to upgradeits credit ratings for the company and its units, New YorkTelephone Co., New England Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., NynexCredit Co. and Nynex Capital Funding Co., to &quot;stable&quot; from&quot;negative.&quot; The rating change affected some $8.5 billion ofdebt, the rating agency said.   The ultimate cost savings from the work force cuts willexceed $600 million a year, or some 8% of consolidatedoperating costs before depreciation and taxes, Sandamp;P estimated.This &quot;would greatly increase Nynex's ability to competeeffectively in the telephone business, and is likely toresult in improved profitability,&quot; Sandamp;P said.   The plan to cut 3,400 managers almost doubles a planannounced in September to reduce the company's managementranks. The business restructurings involve the shutdown ofNynex International Co. and consolidation of its functionsinto Nynex Worldwide Services Group. This will lead to asmall number of employee transfers, a spokesman said.   In addition, Nynex said it would leave the real estatebusiness where the current recession has damped its initialenthusiasm to increase revenue by expanding beyond themanagement of its own properties. Nynex also said it waslooking at disposing of one or more businesses within its BISGroup Ltd., a software and information services company inLondon.   William C. Ferguson, Nynex chairman and chief executive,said the work force cuts and restructurings are necessary &quot;tokeep Nynex in a strong competitive position&quot; and will allowNynex to focus &quot;on information network and servicesbusinesses in which we believe we can achieve profitablegrowth.&quot;   &quot;Let's face it, this company was very much behind thepower curve versus the other Baby Bells in productivity andcost-cutting,&quot; said Jack B. Grubman, telecommunicationsanalyst at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;This will help them weather theblow from continued revenue and demand softness due to theeconomy.&quot;   Last year the New York-based regional Bell company postednet income of $949.4 million, or $4.78 a share, up from$807.6 million, or $4.10 a share, in 1989. But the companytook the $211 million charge to cover a revamping of itscomputer stores and a $325 million charge in 1989's fourthquarter for equipment write-downs, a strike by its unions,changes in its benefit plan and an early-retirement programfor managers.   Included in Nynex's current round of charges is a $395million after-tax charge for costs related to the company'swork force reduction plans. In September Nynex said it wouldtrim its management ranks by 1,400 to 1,900 managers or up to5% by March 1992. On Friday Nynex said it would almost doublethat plan by cutting an additional 1,500 managers for a totalreduction of 10.7%, given Nynex's current roster of 32,000managers.   While more than 6,500 of Nynex's 59,500 craft employeeshave so far elected to take early retirement, the companysaid the fourth-quarter charges announced on Friday cover apotential 10,000 early retirees under the plan that expiresAug. 5, 1995. The early retirement plan was part of a newlabor contract that gave Nynex's unionized workers a 13% wageincrease over three years. Analysts have said the Nynex pactcould be a harbinger of things to come at the other BabyBells and ATandamp;T, whose union pacts expire next year.   Another $155 million in after-tax charges will be taken toaccount for what Nynex called &quot;restructuring initiatives,&quot;including exiting from the real estate development andmanagement business. Besides its own properties, NynexProperties Co. had developed and managed a small commercialportfolio.   In addition, Nynex said it would write off someinvestments and consolidations within BIS Group. While thecompany said BIS is &quot;reorganizing to streamline operations{and will} continue to focus on providing banking softwareand other information services,&quot; Jeffrey S. Rubin, vicepresident of finance at Nynex said the company isn't preparedto say which investments it's writing off since it's having&quot;ongoing discussions with potential buyers and BIS managementabout the disposition of those businesses.&quot;   In the international reorganization, Nynex consolidatedthree units into two, shutting down its Nynex Internationalbusiness and transferring responsibility for its functions toits Worldwide Services Group. Overseas, Nynex Network SystemsCo., Brussels, which is pursuing cellular and other servicesventures in Europe will assume some of Nynex International'sfunctions. Earlier last week Nynex transferred Eugene A.Sekulow, the president of Nynex International, to the newposition of executive vice president of Worldwide Services,reporting to Frederic V. Salerno, Nynex vice chairman andpresident of Worldwide Services.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
