But early March brought generous surges in domestic car andlight truck sales for GM's top rivals, as Ford Motor Co. joined theincentives battle that Chrysler Corp. has waged all year.   Automakers reported Tuesday that total sales of domestic-builtcars and light trucks rose 6.3 percent in early March from a yearago. Sales reached 328,437 in the nine selling days from March1-10, compared with the 274,626 sold in the eight selling days ofthe same period last year.   The percentage change in sales measures the difference inaverage daily sales during the two periods, not the difference intotal numbers of vehicles sold.   Sales have improved in each of the seven sales periods of 1988over early 1987, when showrooms were empty because of the late 1986buying rush to beat impending tax law changes.   In early March, automakers sold 211,772 domestic cars, up 3.5percent from 181,820, and 116,665 light trucks, up 11.7 percentfrom 92,806 a year ago.   Despite last-minute extensions of its buyer incentives, GM'sdomestic car sales fell 13 percent from a year ago and its lighttruck sales slowed 1.5 percent from early March 1987.   GM's domestic car sales fell to 95,372 from 97,487 a year ago.GM's light truck sales fell slightly to 42,489, or 4,721 a day,from 38,327, or 4,790 a day.   ``A lot of people rushed to buy (GM) cars in early February, sowe had a kind of pay-back effect in early March,'' said DavidHealy, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.   GM dealers also had pushed sales particularly hard in lateFebruary, fearing a buildup of unsold car inventories that would behard to move in March without incentives, said Joseph Phillippi,analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.   GM's share of the domestic car market slipped in early March to45 percent from 53.6 percent a year earlier. GM's truck marketshare fell to 36.4 percent from 41.3 percent.   Meanwhile, Ford boosted its early March sales by sweetening itsincentive program, the analysts said. Ford said its combineddomestic car and light truck sales were its highest for early Marchsince 1979.   Ford's domestic car sales jumped 21.4 percent to 68,859 in earlyMarch from 50,407 a year ago and its market share rose to 32.5percent from 27.7 percent.   Its light truck sales rose 18.1 percent to 46,073 in early Marchfrom 34,685 a year ago as its market slice improved to 39.5 percentfrom 37.4 percent.   Chrysler's domestic-built car sales rose 18.3 percent to 34,667from 26,046 a year ago. Its light truck sales jumped 24.1 percent,to 25,287 from 18,108 a year ago.   The No. 3 automaker's share of the domestic car market rose to16.4 percent from 14.3 percent a year ago and its truck shareincreased to 21.7 percent from 19.5 percent.
