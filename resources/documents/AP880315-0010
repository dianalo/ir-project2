Now,he is desperately looking for ways to keep his White House hopesfrom being wiped out by Bush Bush in today's Illinois primary.   In mid-February, everything was looking up for Dole. He hadscored an upset win in the Iowa caucuses, and as the New Hampshireprimary approached, polls were suggesting he could overtake thevice president in the state.   But in one 48-hour stretch _ the final two days before thevoting in New Hampshire _ the Dole campaign derailed, and has nevergotten back on track.   A combination of body blows _ weak organization, poor planning,a mean image and just bad luck _ has reduced the formidableminority leader of the Senate to a battered, struggling candidate.   With the vice president leading 2-to-1 in the Illinois polls,the question Dole faces over and over is when _ not if _ he willwithdraw.   Dole said it will not be today or Wednesday: ``I've made ajudgment that Illinois, whatever happens, we're going to keepgoing.''   From the start, Dole was judged a tough contender for the 1988nomination. A seasoned politician with national stature, the Kansassenator was one Republican who could match Bush in fund-raising,name recognition and experience.   But there were doubts about Dole as well, doubts that all cameto the surface the weekend before the New Hampshire primary Feb. 16_ ``the 48 hours that cost them the campaign'' is how oneRepublican professional described those days.   ``He was ready to put Bush away,'' said GOP pollster LanceTarrance, who worked for former candidate Jack Kemp.   Dole was riding the wave out of his big early win _ a triumph inthe Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8. Bush was a disappointing third behindformer television evangelist Pat Robertson. That should have meanta big boost for Dole for the New Hampshire primary the next week.   ``You need some luck...and Dole didn't get much good luck out ofIowa,'' Tarrance said. ``The news of Robertson beating outBush...was the big story.''   Dole did start picking up strength in New Hampshire. Bush wasdown, and changing his style as his campaign struggled to recover.   But by Thursday of that week, Bush was on the counterattack,readying ads accusing Dole of ``straddling'' major issues. And theDole campaign could not get its act together to respond.   One television commercial attacking Bush _ called ``Footsteps''inside the campaign _ was ready Thursday. But top aides viewed itand judged it ``unusable'' because of poor production and problemswith the script, said two sources who spoke on the condition theynot be named.   Dole tried twice that week to make a new spot, promising to vetoany tax increases, but once again aides judged it not usable, a topDole adviser said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.   When the new ads were ready late Friday, the Dole campaigncouldn't get them on the air. The television stations were closingfor the weekend, making it harder to switch the tapes at thestations.   ``They couldn't get the old ads off the air and the new oneson,'' said the GOP professional, who is not working for anycampaign. ``That's what the campaign is supposed to be able to do.They didn't.''   Then it was on to the South, where Bush rode President Reagan'spopularity and his own solid organization to a wipeout win overDole on Super Tuesday.   Organizational problems have been a trademark of Dole campaignsfrom the start. The wily Senate operator was loath to delegateauthority and had a penchant for snarling lines of authority,several Dole aides said.   Former Labor Secretary Bill Brock was brought into run thecampaign on Nov. 1, but that was probably too late.   ``The Bush campaign has been working on strategy for years,''said the GOP pro.   For example, the Bush campaign had prepared long and hard forthe possibility of an Iowa loss. In contrast, the Dole campaignfound itself pumping up expectations of a victory in New Hampshire,when even aides said the preferable course would have been to talkof how tough it would be to beat Bush in his own backyard.   And after the New Hampshire loss, the image of a mean Bob Dolecame back to haunt him. He snapped at Bush in a televisioninterview that Bush's ads were lying about Dole's record.   The chaos in the final days of the New Hampshire campaign waseerily echoed in Illinois.   Dole went into the state saying he had to win, then backed offon that contention. He made deep cutbacks in his staff, and let theword leak out before he made an explanation. He abruptly moved topull ads off the air, giving rise to rumors he was throwing in thetowel.   To top it all off, his half-hour address to the voters ofIllinois on Saturday night was hit by technical problems.   ``He did it to himself,'' said GOP consultant Eddie Mahe ofDole. ``The voters can't see any big differences between them onthe issues. What they did is make their decisions on personalityand style.''   Mahe said the GOP voters saw each man face defeat in a key earlycontest _ Bush in Iowa and Dole in New Hamsphire. And they likedwhat they saw in Bush more.</TEXT></DOC>
