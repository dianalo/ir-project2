The most favored nation status being sought for the Soviets ``maynot greatly benefit U.S. farmers'' but also ``poses little danger toU.S. farmers,'' according to the report from USDA's EconomicResearch Service.   ``Because of the limited increase in Soviet export earnings (withor without most favored nation from the United States), thecontinued Soviet commitment to increasing its degree of foodself-sufficiency and the USSR's substantial need for nonagriculturalimports, little increase in agricultural imports is likely tooccur,'' it said.   Most favored nation status would put the Soviets on the samefooting in terms of tariffs and other matters as this country's toptrading partners.   President Bush agreed to upgraded trade ties between the twonations on Friday, pressing Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for anew law protecting Jewish emigration as the price.   American agribusiness had been pushing for such a move.   Five former agriculture secretaries, three Republicans and twoDemocrats, issued a statement earlier Friday urging the upgradedtrade status. They said it would ``help build a relationship thatall sides can count on for the long term and be a basis for bringingthe Soviet Union more fully into the world trading system.''   The statement also was signed by 27 groups ranging from theAmerican Farm Bureau Federation to the import-export giant CargillInc. as well as assorted corn, wheat, soybeans, pork and otherproducer organizations.   USDA economists in their report did cite a recent study by theU.S. International Trade Commission that said granting most favorednation status to the Soviets could mean an overall $1 billion gainfor the United States. But it said other studies put the amountlower.   USDA is currently forecasting total U.S. agricultural exports forthis year at $40 billion and the Soviet Union's purchases of grainfrom this country already have made it the second largestsingle-nation customer.   The report said that U.S. imports from the Soviet Union aretypically commodities that enter duty-free, such as precious metalsand compounds, anhydrous ammonia, art work, sable skins andtractors. The report said the Soviets are selling the same sorts ofgoods to Canada, which already has granted them most favored nationstatus.   The report said the Soviet Union has a limited ability to producethe sort of consumer goods that would be most affected by lowertariffs.   A notable exception: Most favored nation status would slash thetariff on imports of Soviet vodka between 60 percent and 90 percentand could lead to imports substantially above last year's $19million.   Most favored nation status would cut tariffs on Soviet energyshipments to the United States by 50 percent to 75 percent.   ``However, the USSR energy sector has difficulty maintainingcommitments to western Europe and other importing countries wherelittle or no discriminatory tariffs now exist,'' according to thereport.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A University of California economist says thereal cost to consumers of the nation's sugar program is ``somewherein the neighborhood of below $500 million.''   The American Sugar Alliance, which represents U.S. growers, isapplauding the finding from Andrew Schmitz, chairman of theagricultural economics department at Berkeley. They claim that it``refutes the often quoted figure of $3 billion as the cost toconsumers of the U.S. sugar program.''   Consumer advocates urge an opening up of quotas that keep U.S.sugar prices above the world market and thus protect a few Americangrowers from huge economic losses that would arrive along with atide of cheap sugar produced in the Third World.   They say the cost to consumers of high sugar prices is $3 billiona year.   Schmitz unveiled his estimate at a recent State Departmentconference on sugar markets. He said the $3 billion figure ``isbased on assumptions which are questionable'' and added that he used``realistic assumptions'' to reach his conclusion.   For example, he said the $3 billion estimate was calculated basedon a world price ``at an all-time low in real terms.'' He said italso was questionable to believe that U.S. prices have no effect onthe world sugar market _ meaning that without the American programworld prices might rise.   He also said the estimate fails to factor in a savings toconsumers by their switch in some cases from sugar to lower-pricedcorn sweeteners.   ``The greater the degree of substitution between sugar use andcorn sweetener use, the lesser will be the impact of sugar quotas onU.S. consumers,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
