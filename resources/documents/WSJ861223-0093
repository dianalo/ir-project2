An administration task force charged with reducing federal regulations met yesterday, and the gas-mileage standards were at the top of the list. &quot;There is strong sentiment in the task force for repeal,&quot; said Boyden Gray, counsel to Vice President George Bush, who chairs the task force.    The task force also recommended shutting down the Interstate Commerce Commission, a move the administration has proposed twice before without success. In addition, it urged further deregulation for interstate trucking and the consolidation of banking regulation into a single agency in the Treasury Department.    President Reagan set up the Task Force on Regulatory Relief in January 1981 to explore ways to reduce federal regulation; the group completed its work in 1983. Recently, he asked the task force to reconvene to recommend legislative changes for a further scaling back in rules.    In a statement yesterday, the task force didn't explicitly recommend the abolition of the fuel-economy standards, but said it discussed &quot;various legislative options&quot; involving them. It also contended that the gas-mileage rules create &quot;economic distortions in the market,&quot; and place U.S. auto makers at a competitive disadvantage.    There is widespread expectation that the White House will urge Congress next year to repeal the standards -- a proposal that is likely to face an uphill fight in the new Democratic-controlled Congress. The standards were created in 1975 -- in the wake of the Arab oil embargo -- to compel auto makers to improve their cars' gas mileage.    While the law has been watered down repeatedly by the administration and Congress, it still enjoys substantial support on Capitol Hill, and among environmental and consumer groups.    Cornish Hitchcock, an attorney for Public Citizen, a Washington consumer group founded by Ralph Nader, said an effort to eliminate the fuel standards would be &quot;shortsighted,&quot; and would stall the move toward increased U.S. energy independence.    Critics, including many economists, argue that the fuel standards are an inefficient way to conserve fuel. They say higher gasoline taxes would be a better way, although the administration has been loath to take that approach.    The law's original mission was to double car mileage by 1985. It set the standard of 27.5 miles a gallon for 1985, but said the Transportation Department could lower the requirement to 26 miles a gallon if circumstances warranted. The department subsequently reduced the standard to 26 miles a gallon for the 1986, 1987 and 1988 model years. Auto makers that don't meet the standard face fines.    Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. had threatened to lay off workers or move some production abroad if the 1987 and 1988 standards hadn't been lowered. This is because U.S. fuel-efficiency rules put imports and domestically produced cars in different categories.    Both Ford and GM, which have had difficulty meeting the standards, welcomed the proposal. GM said the law has placed it at a competitive disadvantage to the Japanese. It said the rule has forced U.S. auto makers &quot;away from their traditional larger-car base.&quot; At the same time, falling fuel prices have bolstered demand for larger models, and the Japanese have moved to fill the gap, GM said.    Under the fuel-efficiency regulations, companies that more than fulfill the standards one year can fall short the next year. The Japanese auto makers are allowed to build large cars currently, GM said, because of &quot;their traditional small-car base,&quot; which has enabled them to build up credits. GM contends that this reduces overall fuel efficiency, because &quot;some of these imports now have lower fuel efficiency than some top-of-the-line U.S. models.&quot;    Chrysler Corp., the only Big Three auto maker to meet the standards, sharply criticized the proposal. &quot;We are setting ourselves up for a third oil shock. It also means the end of America's energy policy,&quot; Chrysler said.    The task force's recommendation to consolidate banking regulation also faces rough sledding. Similar proposals by members of Congress and the administration have failed in the past.    Currently, banking regulation is distributed among the Federal Reserve Board, which oversees bank holding companies; the Treasury Department's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which has power over nationally chartered banks; and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures bank deposits and regulates most state-chartered banks. </TEXT></DOC>
