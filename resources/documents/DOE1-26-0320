Stable wafers with long-term densities of 650 kg/cubicm and 350 kg/cubic m can be pressed from lucerne at 30% and 50% moisturecontent w.b., respectively, using a pressure of 10 MPa applied at a temperatureof 100 degrees C for a few seconds, provided re-expansion is restrainedfor a few minutes after pressing. The dry matter specific energy of compressionis nearly independent of moisture. The coefficient of sliding frictionfor lucerne against steel at high pressure decreases with increasingmoisture content and pressure. The results show the feasibility of thecompaction of lucerne in the partially dried condition. (Refs. 23).</TEXT></DOC>
