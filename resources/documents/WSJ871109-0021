StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   U.S. economic policy in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock crash is prompting some economists to forecast a deeper decline by the dollar than previously thought.    One of the few potentially positive factors for the dollar is the slim chance of a major breakthrough on reducing federal budget deficits, economists said. White House and congressional negotiators are currently discussing steps to narrow the budget gap.    In the meantime, &quot;We've been busy redoing our forecasts for three, six, and 12 months out,&quot; Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel andamp; Co., a London brokerage, said.    Until major shocks hit world stock markets last month, dollar forecasts were heavily bound by the Louvre accord on exchange rate stability among the Group of Seven nations -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- also known as the G-7. The Louvre accord, signed Feb. 22 in Paris, set exchange rate bands for the dollar against major currencies.    The G-7 defended these ranges through coordinated economic policies and periodic intervention in the currency markets by their central banks. Although the exact ranges set by the Louvre were never disclosed, the agreement is generally credited for keeping the dollar between 1.75 and 1.9 West German marks and 140 and 155 Japanese yen for most of this year.    Soon after the October stock market crash, the dollar fell through the supposed-floor of the Louvre accord on speculation about a shift in the Reagan administration's economic policy priorities. Confirming the speculation, last week Treasury Secretary James Baker said that, to minimize the risk of a recession, the administration will keep downward pressure on interest rates, accepting a likely negative impact on the dollar's value.    Since Mr. Baker's comments were reported Thursday, the dollar fell 2% against the West German currency, to stand at 1.6704 marks in late New York trading Friday. That brought the dollar's decline since Oct. 22 to 7.8% against the mark.    Impressed by the magnitude of the dollar's drop last week, Mr. Dennis of James Capel andamp; Co. said he's expecting a continued decline in its value below the levels he predicted last month after the stock market collapse.    In late October, lowering an earlier estimate, he predicted the dollar would fall to 1.65 marks and 128 yen within 12 months. Now he expects the dollar to slide further to 1.55 marks and 123 yen within a year. &quot;But I'm not calling that a bottom,&quot; he said. The dollar was quoted Friday at 135.03 yen.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 134.77 yen.    Some economists fear that the White House's new economic tilt will exacerbate two problems largely blamed for the dollar's 32-month decline. The plan to keep interest rates down to stimulate the economy will lead to enlargement of the already bloated national debt and trade deficit in America, Paul S. Chertkow, director of currency research at Hoare Govett Ltd., London, the brokerage unit of U.S.-based Security Pacific Corp., said. Low interest rates will encourage consumers to borrow more for new purchases, he said. And based on past experience, many of those new purchases will be of imports, he said. &quot;The conclusion that the foreign exchange markets are going to draw is that the dollar has further to fall,&quot; Mr. Chertkow said. He sees the dollar sinking to 1.6 marks and 127 yen within two to three months, and possibly to 1.45 marks and 115 yen with a year. &quot;The risk is that the dollar will move down lower than expected,&quot; he said.    Not all economists see things that glumly.    Sticking to his forecast of early this year, David Morrison, vice president and chief international economist at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., sees the dollar's accelerated decline bringing the currency closer to a bottom. &quot;Some of the (dollar's) levels I thought we might not see until early '88, we've already seen,&quot; said the London-based economist. Mr. Morrison said he &quot;will get less pessimistic about the dollar&quot; when it falls into a range between 1.57 and 1.65 marks, his nine-month-old target. &quot;Once the dollar starts to enter that range, then we can talk about the dollar nearing an equilibrium. If the dollar moves toward the low end of the range, then we might be talking about an end to the dollar's decline,&quot; Mr. Morrison said. His target range for the dollar against the Japanese currency runs between 128 and 135 yen.    An agreement in Washington on major reductions in the federal budget deficit could help the dollar, if only temporarily, some economists said. Toshihide Mizuno, an economist at Sanwa Bank Ltd., New York, said a compromise between White House and congressional negotiators involving a tax increase would prompt West German and Japanese authorities to pursue easier monetary policies, maintaining interest rate differentials with the U.S. In response, the dollar could stabilize at current levels for a month or so, he said. In the longer term, however, Mr. Mizuno sees the dollar falling to between 125 and 130 yen.    The dollar drifted lower but kept its losses to a minimum as traders squared positions or remained idle following Thursday's sharp drop.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 1.6704 West German marks, down from 1.6768 Thursday, and at 135.03 Japanese yen, down from 135.18. In intraday dealings the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 134.45 yen.    Few dealers wanted to carry large positions into the weekend in the event the White House and Congress reach a compromise to cut the budget deficit while the markets are closed. At the same time, traders were skeptical that any compromise would go beyond the $23 billion in cuts to the fiscal 1988 budget that is required by law.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery rose $3.20 an ounce to $460.70 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces.    ---                    Late New York Trading                    Friday, Nov. 6, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
