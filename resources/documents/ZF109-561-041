Bee is implementing a similar program for its Mac and IBMPC and compatible users.andP;  After a third of the newspaper's workers werediagnosed with repetitive strain injury (RSI), the California OccupationalSafety and Health Administration ordered the Bee to provide better-designedworkstations, training programs and rest breaks for VDT users.andM;The Bee was upgrading its &quot;antiquated&quot; furniture when the order came down,said George Randol, the paper's personnel director.andM;Each Mac and PC now sits on a table with two easily adjustable surfaces, onefor the monitor and one for the keyboard.andP;  Users sit on fully adjustablechairs and may request document holders, wrist supports and footrests, glarescreens, and telephone headsets.andP;  An in-house training program teaches staffmembers how to use their equipment properly.andM;Begun last February, most of the Bee's ergonomic upgrades have beencompleted.andP;  Furniture costs were about $800,000, and the annual salary for anew full-time VDT safety coordinator is some $40,000, excluding benefits,Randol said.andP;  The job has been filled by a former copy editor and RSI victimwho no longer can use a terminal.andM;It's too early to measure real productivity gains, Randol said, butencouraging workers to report the first signs of RSI has already meant lesslost time on the job.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
