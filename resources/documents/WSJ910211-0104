Thomas Kling, president of the trade group based inAlexandria, Va., said the petition will focus on theindustrial, aerospace and marine sectors of the U.S. gearsindustry. The Commerce Department estimated U.S. productionin these sectors to be $3.1 billion in 1988, while importstotaled $622 million.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kling also said his group will ask for federalassistance in research and worker training and for &quot;favorabletax treatment.&quot;   The intended petition, which alleges no unfair trading, isbased on a rarely invoked trade statute that allows a U.S.industry to ask for relief on the grounds that its continuedoperation is vital to national security.   The gear makers' association was encouraged to take actionbecause of a report by the Commerce Department saying thatmany U.S. gear makers have laid off workers and are fallingbehind their European competitors' technology. The reportalso said the U.S. industry lacks the capacity to rushdeliveries of aerospace and marine gears to Pentagoncontractors in the event of a protracted war.   In 1986, as the result of a petition of this kind, theNational Association of Machine Tool Builders obtainedagreements with Japan and Taiwan to limit their shipments tothe U.S. to 1981 levels. If the Bush administration grantssimilar relief to U.S. gear producers, imports from manycountries -- including Britain, Germany, Belgium, Japan andSouth Korea -- could be affected.   The Commerce Department will study the petition and advisethe White House whether to take any action.   The petition isn't expected to affect the industry'sautomotive sector, which is made up mostly of &quot;captive&quot;suppliers owned by Detroit's auto makers.   The association appears to have been persuaded by TransEurope, its European counterpart, to seek only moderateimport relief and to concentrate instead on rebuilding theU.S. industry through stronger research and developmentefforts and worker education. &quot;We have been assured that it'sthe intention of the U.S. to maintain an open economy,&quot; saidMichael Opperman, chairman of the British Gear Associationand president of Trans Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
