The agreement marks the first such transfer to a private company. The space agency will give General Dynamics authority to use NASA-controlled facilities and capabilities for commercial manufacture and launch of the Atlas/Centaur expendable launch vehicle. And General Dynamics will reimburse the government for any direct costs incurred from the company's commercial space-launch activities.    A NASA launch of the Atlas/Centaur rocket late last month failed when the rocket careened off course; investigators said they suspected that lightning contributed to the failure. The space agency has one Atlas/Centaur left in its inventory.    After the Challenger space shuttle accident in January 1986, President Reagan ordered NASA to complete only a limited number of commercial space launches when shuttle flights resume, and then turn over commercial space launches to private concerns. </TEXT></DOC>
