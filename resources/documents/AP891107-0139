SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Marines and Army soldiers guarding amilitary site at Galeta Island near the Panama Canal exchangedgunfire twice Friday with a small group of unidentified intruders,the Pentagon reported Tuesday.   ``There were no known casualties and sweeps conducted in thearea at daybreak revealed no evidence of intruders or hostilefire,'' Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters.   However, one Army MP was taken to the U.S. Army hospital witharm, leg and head injuries sustained in a fall into barbed wire.   The Marines first noticed ``unidentified intruders outside thegate'' Friday evening at the Galeta site, located at the northernend of the Panama Canal area and connected to the mainland by aroad, Hoffman said.   About an hour later, he said, ``a group of Marine Guards andArmy MPs (military police) were fired on by a small group ofintruders. The U.S. Marines and soldiers returned the fire.''   There was a second exchange somewhat later, Hoffman said.   Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood said the exchange ofgunfire was the first in months.   After the failed coup attempt against Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega last month, the top U.S. military commander in the region _Gen. Maxwell Thurman _ recommended that the rotations of militarypersonnel be speeded up so that U.S. dependents could be removedfrom the area more speedily.   Hoffman said that no decision had been made on thatrecommendation.   There are about 10,000 U.S. military permanently assigned toPanama, with slightly more than 2,000 on temporary duty. There alsoare about 2,700 U.S. civilian Department of Defense employees, aswell as about 7,700 military dependents and 3,300 civilian DODdependents, the Pentagon has said.</TEXT></DOC>
