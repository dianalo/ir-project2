(creating an automatic code-debugging system)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Nichols, John L.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Program designers can write a simple program that automaticallyassigns an access-sequence-breakpoint (ASBP) code to everylocation in the computer's memory space by using the valuesassigned to memory locations by the assembler or compiler, thesymbol table and an instruction to the ASBP code conversion table.andO;This new technique is demonstrated by a memory-access-sequencemonitor design for debugging code written on an 8085microprocessor that, with a few modifications, can monitor theexecution of a variety of common 8-bit microprocessor types.andP;  Thecomplete debugging system consists of: a hardware logic design, anASBP code-set design and a state-machine program.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     CodesDebugging ToolsAutomationHardwareProgram Development ToolsDesign.andO;Feature:   illustrationcharttable.andO;Caption:   Debugging hardware.
