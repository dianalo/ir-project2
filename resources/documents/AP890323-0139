Gen. Louis C. Menetrey said ``Team Spirit'' exercises were held``solely to test and improve the capability of Korean and U.S.military forces to deter war or defeat aggression on the Koreanpeninsula.''   Also Thursday, 13 U.S. Marines who were seriously injured in ahelicopter crash during the maneuvers left for the United States forfurther medical treatment, a U.S. military spokesman said.   Nineteen Marines were killed in the crash of a Sikorsky CH-53DSea Stallion helicopter on Monday near Pohang on the southeastcoast. Four others died in a separate crash March 17.   Communist North Korea repeatedly demanded the exercises _ intheir 14th year _ be called off and claimed Team Spirit was a frontfor U.S. war prepartions. Radical South Korean students haveprotested the exercises, and opinion polls indicate many ordinarySouth Koreans have a growing doubts about it.   Menetrey said the exercises were necessary because North Koreaposes a major military threat to the south. He said the exerciseswere purely defensive and North Korea's annual protests proved theirworth.   ``The exercise threatens no one, North Korea or anyone else,''Menetrey said. ``In fact, as an effective means to ensure ourdefense readiness, Team Spirit is a major factor for peace.''   The general expressed regret that North Korea had rejected aninvitation to send observers to Team Spirit to reassure thePyongyang government they posed no threat to the north.   About 43,000 U.S. troops are based in the South under a mutualdefense treaty, and they were joined during the exercises by 27,000from Okinawa, Hawaii and the U.S. mainland.   U.S. forces have been based in the South since Washingtonintervened in 1950 to aid the Seoul government against the NorthKorean invasion that started the Korean War. The two Koreas arestill technically at war.   A U.S. military spokesman said two C-141 transport planescarrying 13 injured Marines left a military base near Seoul to carrythe burn victims to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.   Two burn victims remained in good or fair condition at a Seoulmilitary hospital and were not evacuated to the United States, thespokesman said.   Monday's helicopter accident was still under investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
