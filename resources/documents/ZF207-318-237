 While of value to some, these stacks do little toillustrate the potential of HyperCard to make all computers easier to use.andM;The Macintosh, of course, has made its reputation by being easy to use.andP;  NowHyperCard, when used as a front end for communicating with other computers,has the potential of making them easier to use as well.andP;  A number ofHyperCard tools have recently become available that allow you to useHyperCard as a front end to a variety of host computer systems.andM;Avatar's HyperCard API for its MacMainFrame interface card, DCA's HyperCardAPI for the MacIRMA interface board, and the serial and Apple Talk tool kitsavailable from APDA, allow developers and users to create customized frontends to IBM mainframes, DEC VAXes and other similar host computers.andP;  With theuse of the common elements of the Macintosh user interface (buttons, dialogboxes and pull-down menus), a previously confusing user interface to an IBMhost application could be made more accessible to the common user.andM;While such improvements can also be accomplished with such products asApple's MacWorkstation and SuperMac's Acknowledge, these programs requiremore work, cannot be done entirely on the Macintosh, do not support a widerange of communication protocols and interfaces, or are not easy enough touse.andM;Concept to prototype.andP;  &quot;The beauty of [HyperCard] is that I can go fromconcept to working visual prototype in amatter of days,&quot; said David Drucker,director of The Boston Computer Society's MacStackGroup and an independentconsultant.andP;  &quot;Developing a prototype front end to an IBM-based mail system,PROFS, for a Boston area bank took only a week and was enthusiasticallyreceived.&quot;andM;Mark Gire, manager of application and data services at Fireman's Fund inNovato, Calif., has been using Avatar's API since October to develop frontends to VM and TSO applications on its IBM host computer.andP;  &quot;It is easy tobuild things quickly and to see your results immediately,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;HyperCard's object-oriented environment is particularly suitable because youcan build things incrementally and easily share scripts among differentstacks.&quot;andM;Gire faults Avatar's product with one crucial flaw, however.andP;  &quot;The majorproblem is that there is no support for file transfers with the currentrelease,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We need access to the Avatar MacMainFrame file transferso that we can download data from our host into Excel work sheets.&quot;andM;There are other limitations to the Avatar API, notably that it only supports3270 Model 2-type terminal emulation (80 characters by 25 lines), accordingto Gire.andP;  He found that the stack shipped with the product, however, givesusers a good start at developing their own IBM interfaces.andP;  Moreover, Avatarincludes the source code for the external function (XFCN) upon which the APIis based, so that you can make further changes to customize the API.andM;Front to back.andP;  &quot;With the proper tools, anyone will be able to create theirown personalized AppleLink, CompuServe or GEnie interface that is better thanthose available commercially today,&quot; said John DiBiasi, president ofSoftworks of Huntington, Conn.andP;  DiBiasi said that his company may release aHyperCard tool kit later this year that will empower any HyperTalk programmerwith facilities to &quot;whip up&quot; HyperCard front ends to any communications basedservice.andM;The speed with which HyperTalk programmers can create many iterations of auser interface to the same host database could ultimately give end users morecontrol over their data queries.andP;  &quot;By using HyperCard, [internal] developerswill be able to create interfaces to corporate databases that are focusedspecifically on the needs of individual users.&quot;andM;Ideal creation environment.andP;  Most developers with whom MacWEEK spoke seemedto agree that HyperCard provides an ideal environment for creation of hostfront ends.andP;  Kay Lukens, a Seattle-based independent consultant who uses boththe Avatar HyperCard API and SuperMac's Acknowledge, prefers HyperCard.andP;  &quot;Youcan take a stack apart and leave it in shreds on your table to tweak some ofyour code without losing any data,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;Most stacks can stillfunction in a state of disarray.&quot;andM;On the horizon, many people see Oracle for the Macintosh and CL/1 fromNetwork Innovations as providing richer tool sets from which HyperCard frontends can be developed.andP;  &quot;This market is still very much in its infancy,&quot; saidBoston Computer Society's Drucker.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
