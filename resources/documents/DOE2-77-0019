In this process, coals are heated in the presence of water totemperatures in the range of 400{degree} to 650{degree}F at elevatedpressure to prevent vaporization. The chemical reactions that occur duringthe process decompose carboxylic-acid groups in coals resulting in carbondioxide and water evolution, and produce a solid product that has a higherheating value, lower sodium content, and improved dewaterability andweathering characteristics. Under a DOE-funded program, research wasundertaken to develop a data base for the wet carbonization of lump-sizelow-rank coals. The program included wet carbonization tests with fourdifferent low-rank coals from laboratory-scale batch unit to processdevelopment scale unit. A process scheme for the wet carbonization oflump-size low-rank coals was developed and the economics (preliminary)of the process were estimated. The plant capacity for the base case wassufficient to produce beneficiated feedstock to operate a 500 MW(e) coalfired power plant. The heart of the process is a solid-liquid moving-bedreactor. Heating of the water is achieved by direct steam injection.Solid feed to the unit is accomplished by using cost-effective hydrauliclockhopper systems. The integrated plant also includes: solids handling,product discharge and storage, product gas cooling, steam generation,wastewater treatment, and utilities. 20 refs., 15 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
