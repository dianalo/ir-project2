President Richard Miller announced the move Thursday, saying thecomputer industry has lost its boom, forcing the company to undergoa ``fundamental reordering'' and pay more attention to itscustomers.   But analysts, who welcomed the change, said Wang has contributedto many of its problems and that bolder steps are necessary to makethe company more competitive.   ``This is a necessary but not a sufficient step,'' said BarryWillman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. Inc.   The cutback was the latest sign of a high-tech industry slowdownthat has contributed to a softening of the economy.   ``Some fundamental things are happening that will drive all(computer) companies to do things differently or they will fail,''Miller said.   Prior to Thursday's announcement, the company already had cutabout 5,000 jobs this year and announced plans to sell $200 millionin assets. Wang posted a loss of $62.1 million in the first quarterthat ended Sept. 30, and Miller predicted more losses for thesecond quarter.   Miller was appointed president of Wang in August, succeedingFrederick Wang, who had been ousted from the job by An Wang, hisfather, company founder and chairman.   Miller said under the company's new approach, Wang will cut itsbureaucracy to get in closer touch with the needs of its customers.   ``We are eliminating the layers between the field andlaboratory,'' he said. ``We will eliminate entire functions _functions that I view as stifling.''   For example, he said, the company's product development programsoften duplicate efforts, with no single group takingresponsibility. As a result, products often have been introducedlate.   The reorganization of the company will mean the loss of about2,000 jobs by Jan. 1, lowering the Wang workforce to just over22,000, he said.   About 1,000 of the layoffs will occur in Massachusetts, mostlyat the company's headquarters in Lowell, with the rest scatteredaround the world.   A severance package for these employees will result in aone-time charge of $30 million in the company's second quarter,which ends Dec. 31.   Miller said the restructuring announced Thursday would cutannual costs by about $115 million, but he stressed that thecompany was not simply calculating how much needed to be cut inorder to be profitable.   The high-tech industry recently has suffered other setbacks.Data General Corp. announced last month it would eliminate 2,200jobs, and Digital Equipment Corp. recently offered voluntaryseverance to 700 workers.   ``I think restructuring is becoming a common word in thisindustry,'' Miller said.   Miller said much of Wang's bureaucracy grew while the high-techindustry was booming. But now the industry has reached a``maturing'' stage with slower growth, he said.   The bureaucracy ``just built up because of the luxury of verybig margins in a high growth industry,'' he said.   But while Miller pointed to the fluctuations in the computerindustry for many of his company's problems, analysts said some ofthe trouble _ particularly poor customer service _ has been uniqueto Wang.   ``They have had this problem with service and support for a longtime,'' said Steven Wendler, an analyst with Gartner Group Inc.``Rick Miller is a breath of fresh air.''   Also, Wendler said, after the company completes the cost-cuttingmeasures, ``the hemorrhaging, financially, will stop.''   George Elling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said duringthe 1970s and early 1980s, Wang did not pay attention to customerservice because it became confident as a leader in word processingequipment.   ``They had something everyone wanted,'' he said. ``People werewilling to put up with poorer service.''   ``Wang was too slow to recognize they needed to change,'' hesaid, noting that other companies have adapted better to newproduct demands.   Part of the change, Miller said, will include more focus onsoftware and other computer applications.   ``Most customers are not crying for new technology,'' he said.``They are crying for new applications of technology.''</TEXT></DOC>
