OttenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   The first Sunday after Labor Day is Grandparents' Day. A new magazine, Grandparents, is about &quot;all the good things we can do for our grandchildren and the joys we may share with them.&quot; There are special vacation tours for grandparents and grandchildren, special grandparent-grandchild summer camps, even training classes for grandmothers-to-be.    Suddenly, grandparents are getting a great deal of attention. How come? After all, they have been around quite a while.    Well, yes and no. Sure, there have always been grandparents -- but comparatively few. In the old days, most people didn't live long enough to become grandparents, and the lucky few didn't live to see the grandchildren for too many years more. Now, steadily increasing longevity is creating vast numbers of grandparents.    &quot;For the first time in history, most adults live long enough to get to know most of their grandchildren, and most children have the opportunity to know most of their grandparents,&quot; say sociologists Andrew Cherlin and Frank Furstenberg in their recent book &quot;The New American Grandparent.&quot;    By and large, too, grandparents are healthier, more active and better educated than they used to be, and they have more money and leisure time. The frail old lady knitting in the rocking chair has been replaced by the well-coiffed matron selling real estate. The elderly patriarch sternly ruling a score of children and grandchildren has given way to the spry septuagenarian taking courses at the university.    Health, money and leisure also permit more and more grandparents to spend large amounts of time as their grandchildren's friends and companions -- not only giving them the love and affection that busy parents may not have time to give but also reading to them, playing and watching TV with them, helping them with homework, and taking them to movies or perhaps even to Disney World or Europe.    &quot;Any grandmother who doesn't spend as much time with grandchildren as she can is definitely missing something,&quot; says a Los Angeles grandmother who takes her 2 1/2-year-old grandson to a &quot;Mommy and Me&quot; play group two mornings a week, then spends the rest of the day with him.    With divorced or unwed single mothers and two-wage-earner couples increasingly common, grandparents frequently become far more intimately involved with grandchildren, especially in low-income and minority-group families but in well-to-do ones, too. A New Rochelle, N.Y., accountant and his wife had their daughter, son-in-law and infant baby with them for almost two years while the young adults figured out what they wanted to do with the rest of their lives. &quot;It seemed like forever,&quot; he concedes.    In some cases, grandparents may pay for a grandchild's orthodontist bills or college tuition. &quot;Perhaps their most important function is as a reserve, to be there in case of need,&quot; says Gunhild Hagestad, a Northwestern University sociologist. She calls grandparents &quot;the family National Guard,&quot; on stand-by duty to be called out in emergencies.    And with all family relationships in upheaval, &quot;grandparents are increasingly necessary as a stabilizing force in the American family,&quot; writes Colleen Johnson, a medical anthropologist at the University of California at San Francisco.    Yet with the swelling numbers and new grandparental roles come new conflicts. The major conflict, according to sociologists and family historians, pits the grandparents' desire for independence and self-satisfaction against their feelings of family obligations and desire to have good relationships with their grandchildren.    Younger grandparents still have jobs; they want to be with friends and have fun. Older grandparents have been looking forward to retirement and leisure. Says a Baltimore social worker, herself a grandmother: &quot;I hear so many of my friends saying they really have their own lives to lead and don't want to become glorified baby sitters.&quot;    There aren't any good Census Bureau or other government statistics about grandparents. However, a 1986 sampling by Valley Forge Survey Co. for Meredith Corp., the publisher of Grandparents magazine, concluded that there were 49 million U.S. grandparents, almost two-fifths of them over 65 but 6.4% under 45.    As baby-boomers delay childbearing into their late 30s, many men and women today become grandparents for the first time at a fairly advanced age. Most, though, still do so in their 40s and 50s. With declining death rates, many may remain grandparents for as long as 30 to 40 years. Gerontologist Ethel Shanas suggests that great-grandparents may already be more common than grandparents were at the turn of the century.    Naturally, grandparent-grandchild relations vary tremendously from family to family, depending on the age and health of the grandparents, race and ethnic background, geographic distance and other factors. Says Ms. Hagestad, the Northwestern sociologist: &quot;It's a positive thing that there are no strict rules on how a grandparent should behave. It gives them a lot of flexibility. They can serve a variety of functions precisely because it is so ambiguous.&quot;    The conflict between family responsibilities and the desire for one's own life becomes more acute when divorce, illness or other family disruption obliges grandparents to assume a larger role in the grandchildren's lives. In the case of one Washington journalist, his divorced daughter and her two small sons moved in for 3 1/2 years before the daughter finished nursing school and remarried. The grandfather even took the older boy to scout meetings, mixing &quot;with fathers half my age.&quot;    He and his wife never remotely considered not helping their daughter and her sons, he recalls. But he adds: &quot;When you're in your 60s, you're not as psychologically flexible as when you were bringing up your own kids. Sometimes you feel like the old bear who is fed up with the cubs and wants them off his back.&quot;    Grandparents may feel especially burdened if they have a living parent -- usually a frail or senile mother -- who also needs help. Gerontologist Shanas says she frequently hears the complaint &quot;I want to enjoy my grandchildren; I never expected that when I was a grandparent I'd have to look after my parents.&quot;    Another special difficulty comes after a divorce, when the parent granted custody of the children often refuses to let the former spouse's parents continue to see them. The problem has become so acute that all states now have laws, lobbied onto the statute books by groups of the elderly, giving grandparents legal standing to petition local courts for visiting rights to spend time with their grandchildren.    There are those who believe that grandparent-grandchild relations are getting worse instead of better. Arthur Kornhaber, a child psychiatrist who heads the Foundation for Grandparenting, believes that social and economic changes -- a search for self-gratification, long distances between family members, retirement-community living, an increased number of working grandmothers, the proliferation of day-care centers -- are breaking traditional close ties between grandparents and grandchildren, to their mutual loss.    &quot;We have the largest, wealthiest, healthiest group of grandparents ever, and there's a tremendous potential there,&quot; Dr. Kornhaber says, but he believes that the potential isn't being realized. &quot;People in Florida, Arizona say they love their grandchildren, but it's a fake-o thing,&quot; he says. &quot;They don't really know their grandchildren. They don't spend time with them.&quot;    But most specialists reject the Kornhaber argument. &quot;Of course there are some grandparents out for a good time,&quot; says Northwestern University gerontologist Bernice Neugarten, &quot;but I don't find any substantial number turning their backs on their grandchildren.&quot;    Anyhow, says Johns Hopkins University sociologist Cherlin, &quot;the picture of far-flung family ties doesn't hold for the great bulk of Americans. Most people still tend to live fairly close to their parents.&quot; And co-author Furstenberg of the University of Pennsylvania notes that even if some grandparents live far away from one set of grandchildren, they probably are still close to others.    Moreover, modern-day communications and transportation enable even far-removed grandparents to stay in frequent contact. &quot;I have four little grandchildren in California and Arizona,&quot; says Elaine Brody, associate research director at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center. &quot;But I'm on the phone with them all the time, I'm out there every few months. We write letters to each other, they send me pictures and their school papers. You just have to work a little harder to keep the relationship going.&quot;    In fact, although some grandparents are indeed geographically or emotionally remote while others are very closely involved with their grandchildren, most sociologists and other observers agree that the most common form of relationship now is what Messrs. Cherlin and Furstenberg term the companionate style -- where the grandparent is essentially the grandchildren's good pal.    What do grandparents get out of this sort of relationship? Often, say the experts, it is a relatively pure form of love and affection without any responsibility for day-to-day care; the children go home at the end of the visit. &quot;It's a good-humored time, a very warm relationship,&quot; says a Washington labor consultant. &quot;Grandchildren give you nachus,&quot; a Yiddish word for pleasure and pride.    In addition, grandparents may feel reassurance in the perpetuation of the family line, a certain sense of immortality. Given today's increased life expectancies, it is &quot;a new stage of life not as associated with negative consequences as it once was,&quot; says Vern Bengtson, the director of research at the Andrus Gerontological Center at the University of Southern California. &quot;It no longer means death is imminent.&quot;    In return, experts say, a grandchild not only gets selfless love and tenderness, generally without the demands and discipline imposed by parents, but also has a place of refuge, a source of indulgence, someone who is practically always ready to do what he or she wants to do. &quot;Grandparents usually have time, and the thing kids demand most is time,&quot; says Georgetown University demographer Beth Soldo.    Grandparents can also be teachers and role models, conveying a sense of history and family and ethnic traditions and telling stories of the old days or the old country. An older child may find it easier to discuss a touchy problem with a grandparent than with a parent; besides having time and experience, grandparents may be less emotionally involved.    &quot;Grandparents today,&quot; Ms. Brody sums up, &quot;are relieved of many kinds of strain that used to militate against close relations with grandchildren: still busy working, seven or eight children, 20 grandchildren. Today, with fewer grandchildren, better health, more money, more leisure, it's a real connection.&quot; It is no longer the case, as the old saw has it, that grandparents and grandchildren get along well together simply &quot;because they have a common enemy.&quot;    ---             Modern Grandparents Ages of                   With Grandchildren Grandparents:             Aged: 35-44 years    6.4%       Under 1 year    22% 45-49         10.1        1-2             27 50-54         10.8        3-5             42 55-64         34.9        6-11            47 65+           37.8        12-15           30                           16-21           28                           Adults          20 Source: Valley Forge Information Service</TEXT></DOC>
