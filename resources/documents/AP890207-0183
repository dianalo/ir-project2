(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge empowered a man Tuesday to authorizean abortion for his comatose wife in an effort to improve herchances of recovery, but right-to-life advocates immediately movedto overturn the decision.   Three hours after state Supreme Court Justice Bernard McCaffreynamed Martin Klein as his wife's guardian, an appeals court judgegranted two anti-abortionists a stay blocking the ruling until anappeals panel could review it.   ``This has been very stressful and very tiring,'' said ahaggard-looking Klein, who had told reporters after the McCaffreydecision that ``all I want to do is save my wife's life.''   His wife, Nancy, 32, who is about 17 weeks pregnant, has been ina coma at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset since a Dec.13 car accident.   Klein, 34, of Upper Brookville, sought an abortion for his wifeafter some physicians who examined her said an abortion could saveher life and assist in her recovery. The hospital told Klein itwould need a court order to perform the abortion.   Appellate Division Judge Vincent Balletta Jr. granted the stay toanti-abortion activists John Short of Farmingdale and John Broderickof Syosset. The full Appellate Division will rule on the case by theend of this week, he said.   Balletta issued the stay despite an appeal from ElizabethBradford of the state attorney general's office on behalf of Klein.The two activists hope to become legal guardians of both Mrs. Kleinand the fetus to block the abortion.   ``This case is not an abortion case, it's a guardianship case,''said Ms. Bradford. ``Clearly, if Mrs. Klein was given the choice ofhusband of nine years versus a stranger ... she would opt for herhusband.''   Klein's attorney, Sidney Schutz, has labeled the pair``interlopers in a private family tragedy.''   Short, the founder of the Long Island Right-To-Life Committee,said Mrs. Klein was ``closer to delivering a live child. I hope thatfive years from now this child will be celebrating its fifthbirthday.''   Earlier, McCaffrey issued his decision in a courtroom packed withsupporters and opponents of abortion, reporters and relatives.   Upon hearing the decision, Klein kissed and embraced his wife'sparents, Anne and Frederick Zusselman of Delray Beach, Fla.   McCaffrey's ruling followed a two-day hearing last week.   The judge said that, based on medical testimony and records, Mrs.Klein is incompetent and a guardian should be appointed.   He gave Klein permission to authorize any medical procedures thatmay be necessary to preserve his wife's life, specifically rulingthat Klein is authorized to approve an abortion.   Five medical experts testified on Klein's behalf that pregnancyincreased the risks for the comatose patient and could possiblythreaten her life. But the Nassau County district attorney producedmedical experts who testified the pregnancy was not life-threatening.   McCaffrey decided that an abortion was not medically necessary tosave Mrs. Klein's life.   He noted that if Mrs. Klein were competent, it would be her soledecision to continue or terminate the pregnancy up to a 24-weekperiod for any reason without a judicial determination. Under law, afetus is considered viable _ meaning it can survive outside the womb_ after 24 weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
