The helicopter went down about 2 p.m., Kneebone said. Thehelicopter and all three aboard belonged to the 7th Light InfantryDivision from Fort Ord, Calif.   Names of the victims were withheld pending notification of theirfamilies.   The division was among about 1,900 troops sent to Panamafollowing the government's nullification of the May 7 elections andpost-election violence in which three opposition candidates werebeaten.   When the helicopter crashed, it was serving as an escort for amilitary convoy transporting troops between Fort Clayton, on thePacific side of the Canal, to Fort Sherman, on the Atlantic,Kneebone said.   The U.S. Southern Command said the helicopter went down near aroad in the town of Chilibre, about 21 miles north of Panama City,and that it is investigating the crash.   He said the accident caused the temporary suspension of trafficlinking Panama City with the nearby city of Colon.   The helicopter, also known as the Kiowa, is made by Bell.</TEXT></DOC>
