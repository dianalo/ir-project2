But with one stormreceding, a hurricane is on the horizon.   That Florida is in dire need of new sources of revenue isclear to just about everyone. Up for debate when lawmakersconvene in regular session Jan. 14 will be, among otherthings, a tax on services -- including some version of thewildly unpopular tax on advertising -- that was passed, thenhastily repealed, in 1987.</LP><TEXT>   But the political challenge of pushing through any new taxamid a devastating recession -- and with the 1992 electionsin sight -- will be daunting in this well-known tax haven.   &quot;It's just a horrible time to try to raise new taxes, butthere doesn't seem to be much choice,&quot; says state Sen. JackGordon, a Miami Beach Democrat who for years has been pushingthe need to reform the state's creaking tax structure.   Gov. Lawton Chiles has brought Florida's conundrum intofocus by offering not one but two budgets for the comingfiscal year that lawmakers will begin to study next month.   His so-called bare-bones version calls for draconian cutsin health care, education, social services and the criminaljustice system. A second proposal, which he has yet topresent, will be his &quot;druthers&quot; budget. The point, says Gov.Chiles, a Democrat and former U.S. senator, &quot;is to start thedebate: Which kind of a state do you want?&quot;   Florida lawmakers convened in special session last week tocut $513 million from programs and scraped together $109million more from reserves. The cuts in the state's $23.5billion budget will mean more crowded classrooms, delays inopening prisons for lack of staff and cuts in social servicesjust as a bleak economy spurs demand for them.   Without new taxes, the deficit for fiscal 1993, whichbegins July 1, 1992, is expected to widen to around $1.2billion for the same services in Florida, the fastest-growinglarge state.   Florida's budget strife is not unlike that confrontingmany other states. But its rapid growth and its traditionalstatus as a tax haven have accentuated its woes.   Part of the problem in Florida, which is constitutionallyrequired to balance its budget, is that the state relies on a6% sales tax for a large majority -- 69% -- of its revenue.The perils of that dependency have become clear as therecession has curtailed spending and thus the flow ofrevenue. (The state's debt ratings, however, remain double-Aat Standard andamp; Poor's, and the state isn't on the ratingconcern's CreditWatch list.)   Florida is one of just seven states that don't have anincome tax. And because it would take a state constitutionalamendment to adopt one, most political analysts see that asan impossibility. &quot;The chances of a state income tax inFlorida are zip, zero, none,&quot; says Dominic M. Calabro,president of Florida TaxWatch, a nonprofit taxpayer researchgroup.   That leaves the state few options. Among the proposalsmost frequently tossed around in the state capital ofTallahassee is some sort of broad-based business tax, perhapsa value-added tax like the one Michigan has.   For now, Gov. Chiles is pushing for a package of reformsaimed at increasing government efficiency. But once those arein place, he says he will offer a variety of options for newtaxes, including some sort of value-added tax as well as anew tax on services, technically by eliminating a series ofexemptions in the state sales tax. &quot;I'll put everything onthe table,&quot; says Gov. Chiles.   Special-interest groups then would have to lobby to getexemptions reinstated. Many people predict that advertisers,the group that raised the biggest ruckus when the tax waspassed in 1987, will ultimately remain exempt. The 1987services tax, especially the levy on advertising, which wasrepealed, has been credited with the defeat of severalFlorida lawmakers, including former Gov. Bob Martinez in thelast election. &quot;We're not trying to create a politicalfirestorm,&quot; says Gov. Chiles.   Business leaders are arguing that a recession is no timeto impose new taxes. And with reapportionment puttinglawmakers up for re-election in November, few are eager totackle the issue. But many agree with Jon Shebel, chiefexecutive of Associated Industries of Florida, a businesslobbying group, who predicts: &quot;The minute the election isover, here come the taxes.&quot;   Gov. Chiles, who a recent poll showed had only a 23%approval rate, concedes that it is &quot;the worst of times&quot; totry to raise new taxes, but he says he is ready to asklawmakers and the public &quot;to do the right thing&quot; to addressFlorida's long-term needs.   Gov. Chiles, who was cajoled by supporters into runningfor the governor's post after he had retired from the Senateand from public life, muses, &quot;I'm in my second life anyway.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
