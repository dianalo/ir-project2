(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The skipper of the USS Iowa fired adeparting salvo at the Navy, saying it had mishandled a probe intothe gun turret explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard his shiplast year.   Facing the guns of the battleship where the sailors died onApril 19, 1989, Capt. Fred P. Moosally said at his retirementceremony Friday the men who handled the report were more interestedin the Navy's image than the good of the crew.   Moosally said the investigation was handled by people who used``facts and opinions based on unsubstantiated third-partyinformation, unsubstantiated reports and supposition.''   The Navy's investigation concluded sabotage by Gunner's MateClayton Hartwig caused the blast. It said Hartwig, who died in theblast, was disgruntled and suicidal about how the Navy had treatedhim for promotion and assignments.   ``People who in their rush to manage the Iowa problem forgotabout doing the right thing for the Iowa crew,'' said Moosally, a24-year veteran.   ``The explosion ... was a dual tragedy. Forty-seven men died and1,500 survivors were made victims when they should have beenheros,'' Moosally said.   Moosally had previously been tight-lipped about the six-monthNavy investigation of the explosion that sent a deadly fireballrunning inside turret No. 2. At the end of the ceremony he wasawarded the Legion of Merit for leadership aboard the Iowafollowing the explosion.   Moosally's word were soothing to some of the relatives of thedead sailors.   ``I've been waiting for this day, because I was hoping andpraying that the man will really speak his mind about theaccident,'' Kathy Kubicina, Hartwig's sister, said in a telephoneinterview from her home in Cleveland, Ohio.   Ms. Kubicina and other families have been fighting to get theNavy to reopen its investigation. Two congressional inquiries havereviewed the report, which several members of Congress have said isflawed.   ``This is just great news. For the captain of the ship to say itwas inadequate, that really tells a lot,'' said Ms. Kubicina.   A Navy spokesman in Washington, Lt. Mark Walker, said Moosally'scriticism of the investigation was his personal opinion. ``Theinvestigating officer, Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, and his teamwere extremely thorough and professional throughout theinvestigation.''   Walker said Milligan's conclusions were reached ``after anintense methodical investigation during which the Navy conductedmore than 20,000 technical tests that ruled out possible accidentalcauses.''   John Hague, whose stepson, Philip Buch, died in the explosion,has defended the Navy's report in the past. But he agreed withMoosally the Iowa crew had been slighted.   ``There is no doubt in my mind that those men are heroes,'' hesaid from his home in La Mesa, N.M.   Nancy Lewis of Northville, Mich., whose son, Richard, was killedin the explosion, said Moosally ``has joined the ranks of many ofthe rest of us on how the report was handled. .. Maybe the Navy istrying to do the right thing.''   Moosally, a 1966 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, wassucceeded by his executive officer, Cmdr. John P. Morse. Thebattleship is expected to be decommissioned and put in mothballslater this year.</TEXT></DOC>
