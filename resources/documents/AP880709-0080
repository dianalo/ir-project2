CRAFT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush rules out paying reparations toIran's government but says the Reagan administration is consideringcompensating families of the 290 people killed when the U.S. Navyshot down an Iranian jetliner. Michael Dukakis says ``some form ofhumanitarian assistance would probably be appropriate.''   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee-to-be, said Friday inAtlanta he feels ``terribly sad for the families of those people''who died in the downing of the Iranian passenger plane by anAmerican warship in the Persian Gulf last Sunday.   ``I would never, ever under any circumstances offer reparationsto the Iranian government,'' Bush said. He added that heunderstands payments to the victims' families are being consideredby the administration.   In Washington, President Reagan also said the question ofcompensating the families is among matters ``under consideration.''White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there were ``still someopen questions'' on the compensation issue.   Dukakis indicated Friday in Texas that he favors payments to thefamilies. ``I think some form of humanitarian assistance wouldprobably be appropriate,'' said the Massachusetts governor andlikely Democratic presidential nominee.   Bush told Nebraska Republicans today via a telephone hookup thatpolls showing people think Dukakis is more conservative than he isare ``crazy, nutty.''   Speaking from Washington, D.C., to more than 300 delegates ofthe state GOP, Bush said Dukakis is a ``card-carrying member of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union,'' while ``I am a card-carryingmember of the National Rifle Association.''   Dukakis planned to campaign in California, Oregon andWashington. Jesse Jackson scheduled a meeting in San Francisco withsupporters of his Democratic presidential campaign.   Republicans were continuing their unity rally today in Atlanta,scene of the Democratic National Convention July 18-25, andprepared to hear from Bush's former rivals Bob Dole of Kansas,Senate GOP leader, and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.   Addressing the Republican rally Friday, Bush stressed nationaldefense policy and said ``multilateralism seems to be my opponent'sanswer to Soviet aggression.'' Bush contended Dukakis would leavethe United States generally depending on the United Nations tomaintain peace in the world.   At a news conference before the rally, Bush, questioned atlength about whether his campaign was properly repaying thegovernment for the cost of his campaign trips on Air Force planes,maintained ``we are not abusing the public trust.''   Bush may have used tax money on campaign trips, DemocraticNational Chairman Paul Kirk said Friday at a news conference inAtlanta, where he questioned whether the vice president can travelin the next month without violating spending limits.   Bush called Kirk's allegation ``an outrageous charge.''   Dukakis, meanwhile, was still searching for a vice presidentialchoice and campaigned in Texas with one potential running mate,Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. of Texas, chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee. ``I'm pondering,'' Dukakis said of Bentsen at a rallyFriday in Texarkana.   When asked if he wanted the job, Bentsen seemed to play down thepossibility. ``I don't think we have to worry about that,'' Bentsensaid.   In Dallas, Jackson said Friday that his campaign does not haveany veto power in Dukakis' hunt for someone to share the Democraticticket and does not ``choose to exercise the appearance as thoughwe have a veto over anyone in the process.''   Dukakis, responding to news from Washington that the nation'scivilian unemployment rate dropped in June to a 14-year low of 5.3percent, said the figures masked economic suffering.   ``National unemployment rates don't tell you a great deal aboutwhat is happening in communities and neighborhoods and regionsacross this country,'' Dukakis said. ``For one thing, a great manyof these jobs are low-wage jobs, many of them paying no more than$7,000, $7,500 a year. They don't have health insurance,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
