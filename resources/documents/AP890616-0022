Gorbachev's four-day visitto West Germany was enveloped by good feelings and kind words thatwill be difficult to translate into personal political gain.   Both the Soviet president and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohlface an array of domestic difficulties that cannot be washed away byseveral days of friendly, high-profile meetings.   Although Gorbachev's great popularity abroad adds to his prestigeand the status of the Soviet Union, it has not touched fundamentalproblems that trouble millions of Soviets _ a continued lack of foodand consumer goods, housing shortages and stifling bureaucracy.   Kohl and his Christian Democratic party have suffered in stateelections the past two years, losing control of major West Germancities. The chancellor is accused of mishandling recentcontroversies, such as the disclosure of a West German role in analleged Libyan chemical weapons plant and the NATO furor overshort-range nuclear weapons.   The summit produced a historic joint declaration of goals foreasing tensions in Europe and boosted trust and confidence betweenSoviets and West Germans.   But it was devoted mostly to creating a positive atmosphere andskirted sensitive issues like the future of divided Germany anddiffering approaches to disarmament.   After years when their tottering leaders were an embarrassment,Soviets have become accustomed to seeing foreign crowds cheeringtheir leader.   Gorbachev remains popular at home, but many Soviets are beginningto question when and if his reform policies will improve livingstandards.   While he was away, other Soviet officials were struggling withwhat has become a chronic problem _ an outbreak of violence betweenethnic groups, this time in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.   Reasons for the unrest are not clear, but some blame an economiccollapse caused by overcrowding and unemployment.   In West Germany, Gorbachev continually stressed the theme ofcooperation. If the two countries do cooperate more closely, itcould help the Soviet Union in two ways.   A lessening of military tension would allow Moscow to turn moreof its industrial potential to producing consumer goods. Gorbachevhas said he needs a lessening of international tension to devotemore resources to the ailing economy.   Gorbachev invited finance and industry leaders in Cologne to helpconvert Soviet defense industries. That offers another avenue toimproving the Soviet economy _ increased investment by West Germanbusiness.   West Germany is the Soviet Union's largest Western tradingpartner, and businessmen showed the Soviet leader a dazzling arrayof high technology.   But Gorbachev stressed that he did not come as a beggar. Heemphasized cooperation, proposing to merge the Soviet Union'sabilities in basic scientific research with West German technologyfor the benefit of both sides.   Kohl's problems are of an entirely different nature, but no lessthreatening.   His party currently polls less support than the leftist SocialDemocrats and risks losing national elections in December 1990.   Kohl's slide was arrested somewhat after the even higher-profilevisit two weeks ago of President Bush, with whom he was photographedfrequently during a summit that lasted less than two days.   Bush came to West Germany immediately after the NATO summit inBrussels on May 29-30, at which Washington and Bonn were able tomend fences after a months-long dispute over negotiating with theEast bloc to reduce short-range rockets.   Having salvaged a compromise from a confrontation that threatenedalliance unity, Kohl was riding high during the Bush visit. Histhree sessions with Gorbachev also likely boosted his prestige.   Ralf Fuecks, a leader of the far-left Greens Party, remarkedafter the summit that ``Chancellor Kohl had tried to sun himself inGorbachev's glow.''   The effects should be apparent this weekend.   Kohl's party is running candidates for top posts inRhineland-Palatine and Saarland states Sunday as well as EuropeanParliament elections.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Mark Porubcansky, based in Moscow, has coveredSoviet affairs for The Associated Press since 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
