The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 44.99 pointson Tuesday, dropped 2.49 to 2,031.65 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in the overall tallyof New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 512 up, 889 down and537 unchanged.   Analysts said the market's drop over the past week had pushedprices down to levels where they attracted some buyers looking for``bargains.''   But they also said widespread concern persisted over the recentrise in interest rates.   Several large banks raised their prime lending rates today from9.5 percent to 10 percent, a day after the Federal Reserveincreased the rate it charges on loans to private financialinstitutions.   The timing of the Federal Reserve's increase in its discountrate from 6 percent to 6.5 percent suggested to many Wall Streetersthat the Fed was seriously worried about inflation and was becomingmore aggressive in an attempt to stop it from heating up.   For one thing, the rate increase came just as the Treasury wasbeginning a quarterly sale of debt securities.   Among actively traded blue chips, International BusinessMachines fell { to 118]; Ford Motor lost } to 49{; General Electricwas unchanged at 40[, and American Express rose \ to 27}.
