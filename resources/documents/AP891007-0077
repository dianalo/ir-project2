The rally began at a Dutch Reformed church outside Worcester andtraveled to a police station in town where demonstrators presenteda list of demands that included the release of political prisonersand the lifting of the 3-year-old state of emergency.   Boesak, one of the country's best-known activists, said he wouldmake identical demands when he meets President F.W. de Klerk onWednesday.   ``We are not going to have a tea party,'' said Boesak, who willbe joined by two fellow activists, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutuand the Rev. Frank Chikane, head of the South African Council ofChurches.   ``We are going there to tell (de Klerk) that he must create theclimate so that negotiations (with blacks) can take place,'' Boesaksaid.   The crowd chanted, danced, sang and carried the black, green andgold banner of the outlawed African National Congress guerrillamovement.   ``We want to say this is our non-violent, disciplined,determined way to bring this government down,'' Boesak told thecheering crowd at the Esselen Park Stadium, where the two-milemarch ended.   De Klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution withinfive years that will bring the black majority into the nationalgovernment.   The president said last month that the government would nolonger disrupt peaceful protests, and since then there have beenhuge rallies in major cities and several small towns such asWorcester, 75 miles east of Cape Town.   In other developments Saturday:   _Albertina Sisulu, wife of jailed ANC leader Walter Sisulu,visited her husband briefly at Pollsmoor Prison outside Cape Town.Local newspapers have said Sisulu, imprisoned for 25 years and aclose colleague of Nelson Mandela, will be freed within the next 10days.   Mrs. Sisulu, an activist in her own right, is under policerestrictions that prohibit her from speaking to the media. However,the Sisulus' daughter, Nonkulelko Mavumbe, said her father was notaware of any plans for his release.   _The West German Embassy sponsored a concert for poet MzwakheMbuli, who has repeatedly been denied a passport to give poetryreadings abroad. About a dozen other embassies, including the U.S.mission, expressed support or sent representatives to the afternoonconcert at Johannesburg's Market Theater.   _The anti-apartheid Democratic Party decided to retain threeleaders at a meeting in Durban. The trio of Zach de Beer, WynandMalan and Denis Worrall will continue to guide the Democrats, whocaptured 33 of the 166 seats in last month's elections for thewhite chamber of Parliament.
