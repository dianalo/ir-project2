The department said it is continuing &quot;to review carefullythe competitive impact of all proposed asset sales byEastern.&quot; Three weeks ago, the department asked Judge Liflandto halt major aspects of the dismemberment of Eastern so thatprosecutors would have time to examine possible antitrustviolations.</LP><TEXT>   The Justice Department's antitrust chief, James Rill, saidthe proposed sale &quot;would lessen competition in the provisionof airline passenger service between Washington and otherU.S. cities.&quot;   United Chairman Stephen Wolf said the airline was&quot;disappointed&quot; with the decision. &quot;Our proposed acquisitionof slots and gates from Eastern Airlines at WashingtonNational Airport would, we believe, also provide the publicsubstantial competitive benefits,&quot; he said.   A spokeswoman for Eastern said the airline had no commenton the Justice Department's move to block the sale of itsWashington assets.   The sale of assets at National Airport is also subject toapproval by the federal bankruptcy-court judge supervisingthe auctioning of Eastern's assets. Eastern ceased operatingJan. 18 while under court protection from its creditors.   Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland has scheduled a hearingtoday in New York to consider several proposed sales ofEastern assets, including the United deal. The judge hasalready approved a number of transactions, including the saleof Eastern assets in Atlanta to Delta Air Lines. United's Mr.Wolf said the airline was pleased that the Justice Departmentdidn't object to the firm's plans to buy Eastern's slots andgates at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.   The department said it is continuing &quot;to review carefullythe competitive impact of all proposed asset sales byEastern.&quot;   The Justice Department said Northwest Airlines, an NWAInc. unit, should be allowed to purchase the slots and gatesat Washington National. Northwest, which submitted thesecond-highest bid for those assets, would stir morecompetition, presumably leading to lower fares, according tothe department.   United, a unit of UAL Inc., already is the dominantcarrier at Dulles International Airport, which is about 30miles west of Washington in Virginia, Mr. Rill noted. Theacquisition of the Eastern assets would make United thesecond-largest carrier at Washington National, with about 20%of the total slots, the antitrust official said. USAir, aunit of USAir Group Inc., is Washington National's leadingcarrier.   The department fears the United acquisition would lessencompetition on several routes from Washington, includingthose to Hartford, Conn., New York and Florida. Prior to itsshutdown, Eastern offered service on a number of theseroutes.   Another department motive for threatening to intervene inthe liquidation of Eastern is to help Northwest establish ahub operation in Atlanta, where it could compete with Delta,the dominant carrier in that city. In order to challengeDelta, Northwest would need Eastern's slots at WashingtonNational &quot;to feed Washington traffic to the Atlanta hub,&quot; Mr.Rill said.</TEXT></DOC>
