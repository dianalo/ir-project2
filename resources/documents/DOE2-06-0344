Over this range of substrate temperatures,the individual amount of Si atoms transported was found to remain unchanged;whereas the transport flux of Ni atoms was observed to increase. Similartemperature dependence of the flux ratio was found for the Si/Pt system.The experimental results indicate that the substantial Si motion is dueto the temperature-independent part of ion mixing which is associatedwith collision cascades. The Ni motion is characteristic of radiation-enhanceddiffusion which is substrate temperature dependent.</TEXT></DOC>
