Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian wassentenced today to four years in prison and fined $1.5 million forfederal securities and tax law violations related to three takeoverattempts and a stock deal.   The sentence for Bilzerian, 39, a one-time corporate raider whomade a stunning raid on Singer, was the largest handed down in thegovernment's three-year crackdown on Wall Street crime.   U.S. District Judge Robert L. Ward also sentenced Bilzerian totwo years probation and 250 hours of community service for hisconviction on nine felony counts involving deals in 1985 and 1986.   ``The lure of money has caused him _ an intelligent young man _to lose what I perceive to be proper perspective,'' Ward said. ``Inshort, he lies.''   Bilzerian was convicted by a federal jury June 9 of securitiesfraud, conspiracy to commit tax fraud and filing false disclosurestatements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.   The charges involved three failed takeover attempts, involvingapparel maker Cluett, Peabody andamp; Co., building supplies maker H.H.Robertson andamp; Co. and Hammermill Paper Co., and another transactionof Armco Inc. stock.   Bilzerian, of Tampa, Fla., bowed his head and closed his eyes asWard read the count-by-count verdict. His wife, Terri, and otherfamily members sat in the front row of the courtroom at U.S.District Court in Manhattan.   Ward sentenced Bilzerian to four years and fined him $250,000 oneach of six of the counts but ordered the prison terms to runconcurrently.   Bilzerian's attorney, Arthur Mathews, said he planned to appeal.   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Brodsky cited Bilzerian's alleged``arrogance and utter disregard for the law'' during the courtproceedings, and said a lengthy prison term would serve as adeterrent to similar crimes.   ``He has been convicted of a pattern of fraudulent securitiestransactions,'' Brodsky told the judge. ``Over an 18-month periodBilzerian committed serious securities crimes over and over again.''   Mathews sought a suspended sentence on the grounds that theconviction was Bilzerian's first, that the violations for which hewas prosecuted had never before been tried criminally and thatdeterrence had been achieved in the case.   The Bilzerian conviction was the first jury verdict in thegovernment's white-collar investigations. To date, the longestsentence was given to admitted felon Ivan Boesky, who is serving athree-year prison term.   The charges were derived from information supplied by Boesky.None of the charges involved Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover ofSinger in 1988. The case was the first to prosecute illegal stock``parking,'' in which securities ownership is disguised to dodgefederal disclosure laws.   Bilzerian faced a maximum 45 years in prison and fines of $2.25million.   He resigned as chairman of Singer on June 29, when the SEC fileda suit seeking to recover more than $31 million in illegal profitsfrom Bilzerian for ``numerous and serious'' securities violations.</TEXT></DOC>
