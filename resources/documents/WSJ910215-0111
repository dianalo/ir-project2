The changes, which come as bank regulators are preparing abroader package of initiatives to ease the credit crunch,could make it more attractive for banks to lend to debt-ladencompanies or extend credit to companies reorganizing underthe protection of federal bankruptcy law.</LP><TEXT>   Officials said the new disclosure rulings will slightlyreduce the amount of loans that banks must classify as&quot;heavily leveraged transactions.&quot; The interpretations,expected to be issued publicly soon, won't directly improvebank profits, but could help a few large banks ease WallStreet's anxiety about the quality of their loan portfolios.   Securities analysts worry that loans classified as highlyleveraged transactions are less stable than other loans. The30 largest U.S. banks are estimated to have about $50 billionof highly leveraged transactions on their books.   Under the first change, new loans that banks make tocompanies in bankruptcy proceedings no longer have to beclassified as highly leveraged transactions. The reason isthat these &quot;debtor-in-possession&quot; loans are treated as thehighest priority credit of a company in bankruptcyproceedings, ahead of all pre-bankruptcy debt.   Banking regulators -- the comptroller of the currency, theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve Board-- already have told a few large banks about the change sothat they could remove debtor-in-possession loans, known asDIPs, from highly leveraged transaction portfolios inyear-end 1990 reports. A written ruling is expected soon.   The second change will make it slightly easier for a bankto reclassify some highly leveraged transactions as normalloans. The new &quot;delisting&quot; standards are still being drafted,but could be issued late next week.   Under one current standard, a bank can't delist a heavilyleveraged transaction as long as 25% or more of the borrowingcompany's liabilities derive from buy-outs, acquisitions orrecapitalizations. A Federal Reserve Board official said theregulators are likely to waive this requirement in caseswhere borrowers pay off their heavily leveraged loans tobanks. This means that if the bank made a new loan to thecompany, it wouldn't be classified as heavily leveraged.   Another change would allow banks to delist loans toborrowers who had met all their payment schedules andfinancial projections for four or five years, even if thedebt burden remains high.   Bankers are welcoming the initiatives to ease theguidelines. &quot;It's part of the whole regulatory attempt toaddress the credit crunch issue,&quot; said William Pierce, chiefcredit officer at Chemical Banking Corp. &quot;It's veryconstructive.&quot;   Many banks are wary of adding to their heavily leveragedtransaction exposure, said Steven Miller, an analyst at LoanPricing Corp. in New York. Banks currently aren't required toset aside extra capital or make larger loan-loss reservesagainst highly leveraged loans. But there is concern amongbankers that heavily leveraged transactions could come undertighter regulatory scrutiny in the future. Of the 300 bankssurveyed by Loan Pricing, about two-thirds are averse tomaking more of such loans, Mr. Miller said.   Chemical's Mr. Pierce said the ending of the heavilyleveraged classification for debtor-in-possession loans willmake it easier for banks to put together large syndicates tomake such loans. When companies file for Chapter 11bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, they typicallynegotiate a new, post-bankruptcy loan from banks thatprovides cash to keep their business going.   In the past few months, as more companies have filed forChapter 11, debtor-in-possession financing has become abooming lending area for banks. In the first six weeks of1991, such high profile companies as Pan Am Corp., CarterHawley Hale Stores Co., and Interco Inc. have taken out morethan $1 billion in debtor-in-possession loans since filingfor Chapter 11.   The bankruptcy loan ruling and the new delisting standardsfor heavily leveraged transactions may both be included in apackage of accounting measures that regulators hope toannounce next week to ease the credit crunch. Some of thechanges could enable banks to reduce the reserves they haveto hold against nonperforming loans, a move that couldincrease bank profits.   The rules for loans to highly leveraged companies havebeen controversial since federal regulators first issued themin October 1989. Regulators attempted to clarify theirguidance in early 1990, but banks continued to complain thatthe rules were either confusing or too rigid.   The two companies with the largest bank loans classifiedas heavily leveraged transactions are RJR Nabisco Inc., with$5.5 billion, and Time Warner Inc., with $4.5 billion.Bankers have argued for some time that as both thosecompanies pay down debt and improve their balance sheets, theloans should cease to be classified as heavily leveragedtransactions.</TEXT></DOC>
