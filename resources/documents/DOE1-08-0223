Itis stated that in AFMR spectrum MnVG has isotropic gap ({Delta}sup 2/)which size is a maximum at T {similar_to}7 K and sharply decreases withthe temperature fall. Static magnetostriction of the given crystal permitto suggest that {Delta}sup 2/ is not related to magnetoelastic interaction.Possible mechanism of observed peculiarities of AFMR spectra in MnVG- Tahn-Teller impurity Mn/sup 3+/ ion interaction in a crystal, is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
