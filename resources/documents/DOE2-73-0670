Subsequently the burn-up has been calculatedfrom the Cs-137 radioactivity data and then compared with the valuesfrom the theoretical computation and chemical anaylsis. The burn-up valueobtained with the gamma-scanning system seems to be reasonably agreeablewith that of the chemical anaylsis provided that the statistical errorin the experiments is taken into account. It is revealed that the burn-updata from the theoretical approach is slightly higher than those of micro-gammascanning and chemical analysis methods.</TEXT></DOC>
