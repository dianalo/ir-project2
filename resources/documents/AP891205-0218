Analysts say the mark has strengthened amid speculation thatWest Germany's central bank will raise interest rates to help curbinflation, in anticipation that economic growth next year could befaster than expected due to an influx of immigrants from EastGermany and Eastern Europe in general.   The weekend resignation of East Germany's politburo propelledthe mark even higher against major foreign currencies.   The mark has risen nearly 4 percent from early November whenEast Germany opened the Berlin Wall and more than 14 percent fromthe year's low of 2.0290 marks to the dollar on June 14.   In Europe late Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 1.7790 marks,compared with 1.8475 marks on Nov. 9.   At first, the mark fell against the dollar on the dramatic newsthat East Germany was opening the Berlin Wall and the rest of itsborders, because investors traditionally see the dollar as a safehaven in times of political uncertainty.   But the mark quickly recovered and started to climb.   The influx of immigrants likely will boost growth in WestGermany's gross national product by up to half a percentage pointfrom earlier expectations, to 3 percent next year, said JohnCalverley, a senior economist at American Express Bank Ltd. inLondon.   West Germany's gross national product this year was expected tobe up to 4 percent.   ``The logic of it is you're going to have the immigrants of EastGermany and Eastern Europe coming to West Germany needing housesand having demand for basic consumer goods,'' Calverley said.   West Germany traditionally has pursued tight economic policiesto ensure low inflation, which is now running at an annual rate of3 percent.   The Bundesbank raised its benchmark interest rates by onepercentage point _ its fourth rate hike of the year _ on Oct. 5 andother western European central banks followed suit the same day.   The mark also has been strong because Germany's ``fundamentals''are good. Economic growth is strong, inflation is under control,and corporate profits are growing 15 percet this year on average,said Rolf Schneider, head of the forecasting center at DresdnerBank in Frankfurt.   Another factor in the mark's strength is that West Germany'sinterest rates have been rising as American interest rates havefallen, narrowing the differential, said Juergen Pfister, head ofeconomic research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.   The mark's rise helps West Germany fight inflation by loweringimport prices, and boosts American exports to Europe, Calverleysaid.   But it likely will hurt West German exports, and that in turncould slow the West German economy.   ``German industry will becomes less competitive obviously fromthe price point of view,'' said Dieter Wermuth, managing directorof Manufacturers Hanover Bank in Frankfurt.   Export growth will fall to 8 percent next year from 14.5 percentthis year, Wermuth predicted.   What also has helped the mark's rise against the dollar has beenweakness in the U.S. currency, in turn prompted by concerns aboutthe U.S. economic outlook. The mark also has risen strongly againstthe yen and British pound, however.   But some economists think the mark has moved too high and is duefor what traders call ``a downward correction,'' with investorsselling the currency to cash in the gains they have made during therecent rally.   Some experts also are skeptical that Eastern European consumerbuying will materialize or that the Bundesbank again will raise itsinterest rates.   But Schneider speculated that any retreat would be technical andtemporary.   The mark already is considered the strongest currency in theEuropean Monetary System, which links nine of the 12 Common Marketcurrencies to prevent wide swings in their foreign exchange rates.   The system is periodically realigned, and the mark's recentstrength increases the likelihood it will be revalued against theother EMS currencies, a move Germany would welcome and Francelikely would oppose, experts said.</TEXT></DOC>
