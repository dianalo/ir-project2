The order also sets a schedule for reducing the bank'sproblem loans by certain amounts, Arizona Commerce said. Likemany other financial institutions in the state, ArizonaCommerce is suffering from bad real-estate loans.</LP><TEXT>   Arizona Commerce also said its board has consented to anorder by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with&quot;substantially identical provisions&quot; to the state order.   Such orders can be in effect for &quot;30 days to 10 years,&quot;said F. Lee Jacquette, Arizona Commerce chairman and chiefexecutive officer.   Mr. Jacquette said &quot;it's possible, but difficult to raisethe additional capital because so much of the country seesArizona as a black hole because of the real-estate problems.&quot;Most large Arizona banks are owned by out-of-state companiesthat have come to the aid of the banks with capitalinfusions, he said.   Last year, Arizona Commerce Bank posted a loss of $5.6million, or $2.27 a share. &quot;We're still losing money becauseso many of our loans are non-performing and aren't payinginterest,&quot; Mr. Jacquette said. Arizona Commerce has officesin the Arizona cities of Phoenix, Tucson and Mesa.</TEXT></DOC>
