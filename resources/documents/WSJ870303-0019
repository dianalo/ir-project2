In its administrative proceedings, the SEC charged that certain Dean Witter branch offices failed to file required currency-transaction reports for 38 transactions, totaling about $1.1 million, from July 1983 through April 1985. During the same period, Dean Witter filed 105 reports disclosing $1.9 million in cash transactions, according to the proceedings.    Dean Witter, a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., agreed to the censure and settled the SEC's charges without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.    In New York, Michael Stone, a spokesman for Dean Witter, said the problems arose because &quot;operational employees failed to file the correct forms with the Treasury.&quot;    &quot;These incidences didn't involve any money-laundering scheme,&quot; he said. &quot;There was no intent to hide these cash transactions . . . The purpose of settling (with the SEC) was to save the time and expense of litigation.&quot;    As part of the settlement, the brokerage firm agreed to have a system for monitoring cash transactions in place in all of its branch offices by May 1. The firm also agreed to conduct periodic internal reviews of its compliance with cash-deposit reporting requirements and to hire an accounting firm to complete an independent review and report its findings to the SEC.    Federal law requires brokerage firms and banks to report to the U.S. Treasury any cash deposit totaling more than $10,000. The law, aimed at documenting flows of illegal funds, is an important tool used by law-enforcement officials for detecting money laundering in such areas as drug and white-collar crimes.    The SEC's enforcement staff said in the proceedings that it isn't alleging that Dean Witter failed to file the reports as part of any money-laundering scheme. A Treasury Department spokesman wouldn't comment on whether the department is taking any action against Dean Witter. </TEXT></DOC>
