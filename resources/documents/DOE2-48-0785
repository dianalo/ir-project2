<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-0785 </DOCNO><TEXT>An American Nuclear Society Standards Committee Working Group, identifiedas ANS-6.4.3, is developing a set of evaluated gamma-ray isotropic point-sourcebuildup factors and attenuation coefficients for a standard referencedata base. As a first step, a largely unpublished set of buildup factorscalculated with the moments method has been evaluated by recalculatingkey values with Monte Carlo, integral transport, and discrete ordinatesmethods. Attention is being given to frequently-neglected processes suchas bremsstrahlung and the effect of introducing a tissue phantom behindthe shield. The proposed standard contains data for a source energy rangefrom 15 keV to 15 MeV and for approximately 19 elements and 3 mixtures(water, air, and concrete). The data are also represented as coefficientsfor the G-P fitting function. The 1985 data base was released as partof the CCC-493B/QAD-CGGP code package available from the Radiation ShieldingInformation Center (RSIC).</TEXT></DOC>
