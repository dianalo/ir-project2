(``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'')filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') amendmentsto the proposed rule changes as described in Items I, II and III below,which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. TheCommission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the amendmentsto the proposed rule changes from interested persons.<ITAG tagnum="85">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>On December 9, and December 20, 1988, the NYSE filed proposed rule changeswith the Commission to establish listing criteria for new securities consistingof two or more constituent securities which, in the aggregate, are designedto replicate the economic characteristics of shares of a class of outstandingstock (NYSE-88-39) and to provide an exception from paragraph (c)(3) ofRule 19c-4 under the Act regarding the meaning, administration, or enforcementof Rule 19c-4 with respect to constituent securities of common stock, suchas Unbundled Stock Units (NYSE-88-40). Amendment No. 1 to NYSE-88-39 revisesthe proposed listing standards set forth therein to include, among otherthings, a new minimum holder requirement for units and constituent securitiesin addition to new minimum total assets and net worth requirements forissuers seeking to list the securities on the NYSE. The amendment providesthat in order for the units and their constituent securities to qualifyfor Exchange listing, there must be at least 250 holders of the units andthe issuer must have total assets in excess of $100 million and a net worththat exceeds $18 million dollars.The second amendment to the filing proposes a new rule, Rule 405A (SuitabilityRequirements for Transactions in Unbundled Stock Units), which will requireNYSE members and member organizations to explain the characteristics ofthe units and the constituent securities to investors and to determinethe suitability of any recommended transactions in the units and constituentsecurities. In particular, the proposed rule provides that when a NYSEmember or member organization recommends a transaction in units or constituentsecurities to a customer, the member or member firm must make a determinationas to the products suitability for such customer and must have a reasonablebasis for believing that the customer has sufficient knowledge and experiencein financial matters to be reasonably expected to be capable of evaluatingthe risks and the special characteristics of the recommended transactionand is financially able to bear the risks of any of the constituent securities.Amendment No. 1 to NYSE-88-40 amends the text of the rule change set forthin the Original Filing, Item I <T3>Text of the Proposed Rule Change.</T3>\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Minor technical language changes were made to AmendmentNo. 1 in a letter to Howard Kramer, Division of Market Regulation, SEC,from Vince W. Plaza, Listing andamp; Compliance, NYSE, dated March 9, 1989.In summary, the revised rule replaces the original third subparagraph withlanguage that:_Reduces the total amount of shares that may be subject to an exchangeoffer from 25% to 20%._Defines insider and control groups and provides further clarificationon the determination of whether an exchange offer enhances the standingor voting control of such groups.The revised rule also sets forth an additional consideration which addressesthe collective action problems (discussed in the Release of the SEC thataccompanied the adoption of the Rule) contained in the second paragraphof the Exchange's rule.Finally, definitional language has either been modified or added to addressthe characteristics of the units and the terms used relating to ``person,''``officer,'' and ``beneficial ownership'' as defined in the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 and SEC rules.The text of the amended rule with deletions shown in brackets and additionsshown in italics is printed in full below:(a) This proposed rule change consists of a stated policy or interpretationof Rule 19c-4 (the ``Rule'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(the ``Act'') and establishes or changes a standard or guideline with respectto the meaning, administration or enforcement of the Rule. This proposedrule change reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 19c-4(c)(3), the Exchange maydetermine that it will not proceed to delist the equity securities of acompany because that company has issued or proposes to issue in an exchangeoffer for outstanding shares of its common stock units and their constituentsecurities which have no vote or a lesser vote than its outstanding commonstock where the Exchange, after considering all the surrounding circumstances,including other action that may have been taken or is proposed to be takenby the company, determines that the exchange offer does not (or did not)give rise to the collective action problems discussed in the Release ofthe SEC that accompanied the adoption of Rule 19c-4, is not (or was not)coercive in nature and does not (or did not) have the effect of disenfranchisingoutstanding common stock holders.</ITAG>For example, if the Exchange determines that the exchange offer,<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; does not depend on a shareholder vote but is available forthe individual choice of all outstanding common stock holders in fair andnondiscriminatory manner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; is accompanied by a prospectus under the Securities Act of1933 (or a comparable disclosure document) that describes the exchangeoffer and the securities being offered,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; is not an exchange offer which, either alone or in the aggregatewith prior similar exchange offers, is for more than 20% of the outstandingcommon stock of the company as of the date of the filing of a registrationstatement (or the mailing of a comparable disclosure document) relatingto the first such offer, and on the date immediately prior to the datethe registration statement is filed (or the comparable disclosure documentis mailed) relating to the exchange offer to be made:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The company does not have knowledge, within the meaning of Item403(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that any person (except any personwho is a bank as defined in Section 3(a)(6) of the Act, an investment adviserregistered under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1;940, [tothe extent such bank or investment adviser holds such securities as a financialintermediary on behalf of customers and not for its own account] or anemployee benefit plan, or pension fund which is subject to the provisionsof the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), is the beneficialowner of more than five percent of any class of the company's voting equitysecurities, and (b) officers and directors of the company, and any employeebenefit plan or pension fund of the company, as a group, do not beneficiallyown more than 10 percent of any class of the company's voting equity securities,unless, on the date shares of common stock are accepted for exchange inthe exchange offer and after giving effect thereto, the percentage of theclass of voting equity securities beneficiary owned (1) by any person includedin clause (a) and (2) by the group included in clause (b), as the casemay be, is not increased above the percentage beneficially owned by suchperson or group immediately prior to the filing of such registration statement(or the mailing of such disclosure statement), and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; does not adversely affect the voting rights of the holdersof outstanding common stock that do not accept the exchange, then the exchangemay conclude that the exchange offer is not inconsistent with Rule 19c-4.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, the Exchange will also consider all relevant factors,including whether the proposed exchange offer is made in conjunction with,or as one of a series of, transactions the effect of which is to createor enhance the standing of an insider or control group.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The term `units' as used herein shall mean unbundled stock units orsecurities with substantially similar characteristics issued by a corporationwhich consist of, and are separable into, two or more constituent securities,which, in the aggregate, [are designed to replicate the economic characteristics]<T3>provide economic characteristics substantially similar to those</T3>\2\<NOTE/> typically associated with ownership of the corporation'scommon stock and have a term in excess of three years. The term `constituentsecurities' as used herein shall mean the two or more constituent securitieswhich together make up the unit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The NYSE also proposes to amend NYSE-88-39 to includeidentical language in both the proposed listing standard (Paragraph 703.16of the NYSE Listed Company Manual) and new Rule 405A. <T3>See </T3>letter from James E. Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary,NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Branch Chief, Branch of Exchange Regulation, datedMarch 6, 1989.For the purposes hereof, ``person'' shall have the meaning set forth inSection 3(a)(9) of the Act and shall include any group as that term isdefined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Act; ``officer'' shall have the samemeaning as that term is used in Items 201(b)(2)(iii) and 403(b) of RegulationS-K of the SEC; and ``beneficial ownership'' of voting equity securitiesof the company shall be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 and Item403 of Regulation S-K of the SEC.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changesand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule changes. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the place specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements.(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule Changes<ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Purpose</ITAG>In recent months, some publicly traded corporations have announced plansto issue a new type of security consisting of two or more constituent securitieswhich, in the aggregate, are designed to replicate the economic characteristicstypically associated with ownership of shares of a class of outstandingstock of the corporation. Thus, a corporation might issue a unit consistingof, for example, several constituent securities, each of which is separablefrom the others and may trade by itself or in combination with one or allof the other constituent securities. This approach may permit investorsto separate their securities holdings into distinct trading componentsrepresenting discrete interests in the income and capital appreciationpotential of the securities involved.The securities may include, but are not limited to, any combination ofthe following:andbullet; Common stockandbullet; Preferred stockandbullet; Warrantsandbullet; Debt securitiesProposed Rule 405A requires members and member organizations to affordan explanation of the unique characteristics of unbundled stock units toinvestors interested in trading the units and constituent securities. Whenrecommending a transaction to a customer in the units or constituent securities,a member or member organization must make a determination as to its suitability,must have a reasonable basis for believing that the customer has the knowledgeand experience in financial matters to be reasonably expected to be capableof evaluating the risks of the recommended transaction and must be financiallyable to bear the risks of the constituent securities.In addition, the Exchange reviewed its proposed rule, as set forth in NYSE-88-40,within the context of the public commentary received by the Commissionwhen such rule was published. There was concern expressed about what appearedto be the degree of discretion afforded the Exchange in determining whatconstituted an insider or control group as well as how it would be determinedwhether the standing of such insider or control group would be createdor enhanced. As a result, the language of the proposed rule has been revisedto specify percentage ownership levels that would determine insider andcontrol groups impacted by the rule.Further, it was felt that the language in the revised rule should eliminateany misunderstanding that, even though the company's proposed exchangeoffer met the rule's various provisions, the Exchange could still determinethat such exchange offer was a violation of Rule 19c-4. This determinationwould be based upon whether the proposed offer is being made in conjunctionwith, or as one of a series of, transactions the effect of which is tocreate or enhance the standing of an insider or control group.<ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Statutory Basis</ITAG>The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Actwhich, among other things, requires Exchange rules to be designed to promotejust and equitable principles of trade, and to, in general, protect investorsand the public interest.<T3>(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competiton </T3>The proposed rule change will not impose any burden on competition thatis not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of the Act.<T3>(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participant or Others  </T3>The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments concerningits proposed rule change.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timingfor Commission Action  </ITAG>Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>or within such longer period (i) as the Commissionmay designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer periodto be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as towhich the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or  (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule changeshould be disapproved.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Solicitation of Comments  </ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and argumentsconcerning the proposal. The commission notes that it has received approximately100 comment letters in response to its previous solicitation of commentson NYSE-88-40. The majority of these letters opposed the exchange of commonstock for Unbundled Stock Units (USUs) on the basis that such exchangeoffer would violate Rule 19c-4 under the Act by disenfranchising existingshareholders, and argued that these exchanges should not be exempted fromthe prohibition in Rule 19c-4 on exchange offers of securities with unequalvoting rights. Accordingly, the Commission is specifically soliciting commenton a variety of issues that the commentators have raised concerning theuse of USUs as well as some other issues raised by the NYSE proposal. First, the Commission solicits comment on whether the aforementioend amendmentsto NYSE-88-40 adequately address the Rule 19c-4 concerns by ensuring thatan exchange offer of common stock for USUs without voting rights wouldhave only a deminimus effect on the voting rights of existing shareholders.In particular, the Commission notes that the amendments would limit anyexchange offer of common stock for units to 20% of the company's outstandingstock, rather than 25% as originally proposed, and limit the availabilityof such an exchange offer to those companies that do not have any personholding 5% or more, and that do not have officers, directors, and any employeebenefit plan or pension fund, in the aggregate, holding 10% or more ofthe company's outstanding stock at the time of the filing of the registrationstatement of such exchange offer.\3\<NOTE/> The commission requests comment on whether the 5% and 10%standards are appropriate to ensure that USUs can not be used to createan insider group or significantly enhance the standing of such group ina company. Commentators may also wish to address the administerabilityof the NYSE proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ We note that, under the proposed amendments, a companywith persons or groups exceeding either the 5% or 10% standard could stillissue USUs, as long as the percentage of beneficial ownership for thosepersons and groups exceeding the standard remains the same before and afterthe issuance of USUs.  Second, several commentators have thus far expressed concern that an exchangeoffer of USUs for common stock will have the same coercive effect on existingshareholders as the classic dual-class exchange offer of high vote stockfor low vote stock with a dividend sweetener which presumptively violatesRule 19c-4.\4\<NOTE/> Under this view, the ``downside'' protection provided bythe bond component of the USU and the incremental dividend sweetener tocoerce shareholders to exchange voting stock for no or low vote stock inan exchange offer.\5\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission solicits comment as to whetherthe offer to exchange voting common stock for nonvoting USUs would coerceshareholders into tendering their shares even when such action would becontrary to their collective interest. If so, do the amendments to NYSE-88-40address the concern by increasing the likelihood that a shareholder whochooses not to tender will continue to have meaningful voting rights afterthe exchange.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-25891 (July 7, 1988),53 FR 26576 (July 12, 1988) (``Adopting Release'') at 26381.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The bond subunits provide fixed interest payments andpayment of a principal value in 30 years, and the preferred subunits providea fixed liquidation value, so that each unit as a whole provides a minimumreturn regardless of the market value or dividend pay-out of the issuerover the 30 years from the time of the exchange offer.The Commission also notes that several commentators have thus far suggestedthat the economic benefits provided by USUs can be achieved without deprivingthose shareholders who exchange common stock for USUs of the voting rightswhich attached to their common stock.\6\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission solicits comment on the feasibilityand desirability of attaching voting rights in some form to a USU and/orits component parts and if so, what would be the appropriate allocationof votes to the component parts of the USU. In this connection, the Commissionnotes that attaching voting rights to the bond subunit of the USU may affectthe expected tax consequences. Therefore, we solicit comments on whetherany voting rights accompanying a USU should be limited to the IncrementalDividend Preferred (``IDP'') share subunit, or the Equity AppreciationCertificate (``EAC'') subunit and/or the combined Equity Subunit (``ESU'').In this regard, the Commission notes that the relative values of the IDP,EAC and debt portion of a USU may fluctuate substantially during theirthirty year life. Commentators should specifically address, therefore,whether fixing voting rights of the IDP and EAC at the time of their issuancemight, in effect, result in the creation of super voting shares at anytime that the relative value of the IDP or the EAC decreases. To the extentcommentators believe that a periodic recalculation of voting rights betweenthe IDP and EAC would be preferable, those commentators are requested toaddress any burdens imposed on issuers resulting from the creation of shiftingvoting rights. Comment is also requested as to whether such a recalculationof voting rights in permissible under state corporate law or under thecorporate charter provisions of NYSE issuers.\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See e.g. </T3>Letters from Bernard S. Black, Associate Professor ofLaw, Columbia University, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated February2, 1989; California Public Employees Retirement to David S. Ruder, Chairman,SEC, dated February 2, 1980; and Robert A.G. Monks, President, InstitutionalShareholder Services, Inc. to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated February3, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ For example, Shearson Lehman Hutton is a comment letteron SR-NYSE-40 states that fluctuating voting rights for the IDP could createthat fluctuating voting rights for the IDP could create significant problemsfor one of the four USU issuers due to restrictions in its corporate charter.<T3>See, </T3>letter from Ronald E. Gallatin, Managing Director, ShearsonLehman Hutton, to Securities and Exchange Commission, dated February 10,1989. Finally, the Commission is also soliciting specific comments on the amendmentsto NYSE-88-39, discussed above, that would add certain additional quantitativestandards for listing USUs on the NYSE in addition to imposing specificsuitability requirements for transactions in USUs. First, we solicit commenton whether the 250 holder requirement and the requirement that issuersof USU's have total assets in excess of $100 million and a net worth inexcess of $18 million are adequate to ensure that USU's and the constituentsecurities traded on the NYSE are of sufficient size and distribution tosustain a fair and orderly market for the product. In particular, we solicitcomment on any liquidity concerns raised or answered by these standardsand whether a minimum of 250 holders will ensure that USUs and their constituentsecurities are adequately diversified and not held by too few investorsor institutional groups. Second, we solicit comment on the suitabilityrequirements being proposed in Amendment No. 2 for USUs and their constituentsecurities. In particular, we solicit comment on whether the proposed suitabilitystandards in proposed Rule 405A adequately ensure that investors will beinformed about the risks and uncertainties involving trading of USUs andtheir component parts and, if not, what other standards should be imposed.Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof withthe Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW.,Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that arefiled with the Commission, and all written communications relating to theproposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other thanthose that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisionsof 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission'sPublic Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549.
