(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For 53 years, Sister Alice Trese laboredin the Lord's vineyard as a college registrar and social worker forthe Sisters of St. Joseph.   Now 89, Sister Alice spends her days in the order's retirementhome, a wing on the convent she entered as a young woman in 1929.   ``I can't get used to the idea I can't do what I used to do,''says Sister Alice, who worked as a receptionist and in the order'slaundry even after retiring seven years ago. ``I can't get used tothe idea of failing health.''   Now, Sister Alice and her retired friends attend Mass every day,say their rosaries, and root for the Detroit Tigers just like theyhave since their younger days.   These frail women of God are part of an aging breed of RomanCatholic nuns and monks moving into retirement while fewer andfewer young women and men are entering convents and monasteries tosupport them.   The result is a fiscal nightmare that has left an estimated $3billion deficit in retirement budgets across the country, saysSister Mary Oliver Hudon.   She is director of a retirement project of the NationalConference of Catholic Bishops, Conference of Major Superiors ofMen and the Leadership Conference of Women Religious.   Nearly 36 percent of the estimated 122,000 nuns and monks in theUnited States are over age 70 and less than 1 percent are under 30,she says.   ``The base that can support the older religious (nuns and monks)has just been eroded away,'' she said.   Few orders stashed money away for retirement, in part becausenuns worked for low wages and because they preferred to spend themoney building hospitals or adding services, Sister Mary Oliversays.   ``They made that choice on the assumption that when people wereno longer active, they died,'' she says. ``It sounds terrible, butI don't think anybody foresaw the social changes'' that led tolonger life spans and far fewer people entering religious life.   Diocesan priests, who aren't members of religious orders,weren't included in the retirement project, she says. Theirpensions are funded by all the churches in the diocese for whichthey worked, rather than a single order.   The Sisters of St. Joseph mirror the national picture, with 220of their 455 members retired, says Sister Betty Veenhuis, presidentof the congregation.   The order, founded 100 years ago by nuns from New York who camewest to staff Borgess Hospital in Kalamazoo, once had 950 membersworking in hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, and Catholicschools across southern Michigan.   Thirty years ago, Sister Betty says, as many as 50 young womenwould have been preparing to enter the convent, which comprises thespot on the map called Nazareth.   Now it has only 18 women under 40 and just one woman _ in her40s _ preparing for admission, she says. At the other end of thespectrum, 13 are over 90.   Sister Betty says mergers with other orders could bolster thesisters' ranks in the future, as could discussions with a group ofabout 100 lay people in the Kalamazoo area who want to beaffiliated in some way with the Sisters of St. Joseph.   Like many orders, the Sisters of St. Joseph joined SocialSecurity in 1971 when the law was changed to permit nuns and monksto make back payments and enter the system.   Sister Emily Simons, treasurer of the order, says SocialSecurity provides just $2,000 of the $10,000 annual cost of caringfor a retired member. The rest comes from the earnings of youngersisters, who take vows of poverty and turn their earnings over tothe order.   But Sister Betty says that isn't enough and this year the orderwill need to tap the interest on a retirement fund that it has beenpaying into since 1971.   Sister Emily says the congregation's assets, including itsmembers' earnings, Social Security, retirement fund and theproceeds from selling all its property except the motherhouse,would be 45 percent short of the amount needed to care for thecurrent members until their death.   She estimates the deficit to be in the millions of dollars, butdeclines to be more specific.   The sisters know of the looming financial crisis and try to cutcorners, Sister Betty says.   ``I don't think they at all fear that we're going to run out ofmoney and that they're going to be on the street,'' she says.   ``It simply calls us to good stewardship and good planning andgood use of our resources over the next five or 10 years.''   Sister Mary Oliver says some orders try to sell off their landand buildings, but often can't find buyers for their agingfacilities.   Despite the growing problem, she says, most orders still can paytheir bills.   ``There is not a sister or brother I know of who is starving ornot getting medical care,'' she says. ``The crunch is going to comein five to 10 years.''   Sister Betty is putting her faith in old-fashioned Christiancharity and a committee that advises the order on investmentdecisions.   In December, Michigan Catholics contributed more than $1.45million to a new fund set up to bail out religious orders, saysSister Monica Kostelmy of the Michigan Catholic Conference.   Final figures aren't in, but Sister Mary Oliver expects morethan $20 million will be collected nationwide in the first of 10annual appeals.   The funds will go first to desperate orders, such as one with 17of its 18 members over 70, and then be divided among the others'retirement funds, she says.   Sister Betty says the Sisters of St. Joseph will stick together,rather than going back to their families or elsewhere for care intheir twilight years.   ``We care for one another,'' she says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 16</NOTE></DOC>
