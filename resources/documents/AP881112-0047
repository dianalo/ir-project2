(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police are looking for a man who ripped off atleast nine people in a carefully crafted swindle in which he posedas a doctor and used fake cashier's checks to buy $150,000 injewelry.   ``He's cool, calm and collected,'' said Tampa police DetectiveLeroy Black. ``I've seen a lot of scams, but this one is brilliant.''   The con artist dressed in a white doctor's coat, gave out cardsidentifying himself as Victor H. Hernandez, M.D., and met hisvictims in hospital lobbies, police say.   He looked 45 to 55 years old, with dark hair edged with gray,glasses and an expensive suit.   One couple needing to raise money placed a classified ad to sell31 pieces of jewelry. A man responded to the ad and arranged to meetthem in the lobby of St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa.   ``He said he was due in surgery. And sure enough, in a fewminutes, his name came over the intercom,'' said the 50-year-oldwoman, whose name was not released.   The doctor gave the couple a cashier's check for $17,000 andhustled off to surgery. The check bounced.   The man conned four other victims at the same hospital in onehour. At Sarasota Memorial Hospital, he scammed four people in threehours. His last hit was Oct. 24 in Sarasota.   ``What better scenario for this guy _ a hospital!'' said StephenKarekos, 54, who sold a gold Rolex watch to finance home remodeling.``I tell you, this guy looked like a doctor.''   Greg Becker, a Tampa salesman, sold two rings for $3,000.   ``If you saw this guy, you'd think he's a doctor,'' Becker said.``I'm not embarrassed by it. This guy was just too good.''</TEXT></DOC>
