White House officials had said theissue was too complex to deal with until after the 1992 presidentialelection.;   But polls and some politicians have been warning the GOP thatvoters take the issue seriously.;   &quot;Several months ago, I predicted thathealth care would be the No. 1 issue in the 1992 presidential race,&quot; saidSenate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.;   More Pennsylvanians identifiedhealth-care costs as the issue they were &quot;most concerned&quot; about, according toa post-election poll for the Health Insurance Association of America.;   InCalifornia, 80 percent of those surveyed by a Washington-based polling firm inJuly favored &quot;fundamental changes&quot; in the state's health-care system, and 74percent said they were more likely to vote for a U.S. Senate candidate whoproposed access to care for all Californians.;   The United States spends $670billion a year on health care -- more than any other nation -- and that amountis growing at a rate that economists say is unsustainable. Yet almost 35million Americans -- including 5.5 million in California -- lack healthinsurance coverage.;   Bush's comments were well received by congressionalDemocrats, who have made health-care reform a top priority all year.;   ButSen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., a leading reform advocate, had this warning forBush: &quot;Democrats in the Senate and Americans across the country won't accepthalf-measures or gimmicks.&quot;;   In his State of the Union speech two years ago,Bush pledged to tackle the interlocking problems of soaring health costs anddeclining access to care. His plan was expected this January, but theadministration backed off.;   A senior White House official said Bush isevaluating the proposals that have been made in Congress, where 13 majorhealth-care bills are pending.;   In broad outline, those bills mirror theproposals that have been debated in Sacramento in the past few years.;   Asizable group of House Democrats wants to scrap the present system of privatehealth insurance and go to a government-run plan like Canada's. In California,that approach is favored by a coalition of labor, consumer and religiousgroups known as Health Access.;   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, favors a less-radical approach. Mitchell has proposed requiringemployers to provide health insurance for their workers or pay a tax thatwould support government coverage for the uninsured.;   This &quot;pay-or-play&quot;system is perhaps the most popular option among California legislators, but ithas been opposed by Gov. Pete Wilson and former Gov. George Deukmejian becauseof fears it could bankrupt some small businesses.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  R.A.
