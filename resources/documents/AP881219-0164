(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A reward of nearly $7,000 was announcedMonday in hopes of finding out who is responsible for the deaths ofthree cougars that were part of a program to re-establish endangeredFlorida panthers.   U.S. Rep. Bill Grant said that he and state and private gameofficials hope to raise more money to get the reward up to $10,000.   Three of five cougars caught in Texas and released into theOsceola National Forest in June have died, threatening thestate-federal program aimed at finding a new habitat for Floridapanthers.   Hunters have been blamed in two of the cougar deaths, while thecause of the third death could not be determined, said Tom Logan,chief of wildlife research for the game and fish commission.   The two remaining cougars are believed to be in good health.   Fewer than 30 panthers are believed to be remaining in the swampsand scrubland of central and southern Florida, as their naturalhabitat is chipped away by development.   That is why wildlife authorities are attempting to establishpanthers in the Osceola forest in north-central Florida. Theybrought the five cougars, which have habits similar to those of theendangered panthers, to the forest to see how well they adapt.   State officials have no firm leads in the deaths but expect thereward money may help, said Woody Darden, spokesman for the FloridaGame and Fresh Water Fish Commission.   ``We think at this point, the only real possibility of getting aconviction is if somebody comes forward,'' said Darden. ``Most ofthe time when people do something like this, they're going to talkabout it.''   Conviction of killing one of the cougars carries a possibleprison sentence of five years and fine of up to $5,000.</TEXT></DOC>
