Kenyon approved anew map of county supervisorial boundaries here with avoting-rights order that could shift the balance of power inone of the nation's most populous counties.   Judge Kenyon's order creates a new district designed toassure that a Hispanic is elected to the county's five-membergoverning board, but also allows candidates who don't live inthe district to seek to represent the district on the board.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Kenyon adopted the redistricting plan proposed bythe American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican AmericanLegal Defense and Education Fund. An estimated 35% of thecounty's 8.7 million residents are Hispanic, according to ademographer who drew up the plan.   The Los Angeles County plan affects more people than anyother local voting-rights case and may serve as a precedentfor other municipalities, said Chandler Davidson, a RiceUniversity sociology professor and author of a book about theunderrepresentation of minorities in state and local electiveoffices.   Noting that most of the voting-rights litigation hasoccurred in the deep South and Texas, Mr. Davidson said&quot;California is ripe for this type of litigation,&quot; with largeHispanic, black and Asian minorities. &quot;There are a lot ofpotential plaintiffs out there.&quot;   Conservative county supervisors Michael Antonovich andDeane Dana said they filed a motion Friday with the 9thCircuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to block thejudge's order. With the new district lines the pair facelosing their sway over the board.   &quot;It's a judge running wild -- making law instead ofinterpreting law,&quot; Mr. Antonovich said. &quot;It's disgusting tosee Judge Kenyon work with two special interest groups . . .in pursuing their liberal ideological agenda.&quot;   ACLU attorney Mark Rosenbaum disagreed saying, &quot;The boardof supervisors is the most powerful local government in theUnited States and some want it to remain an exclusiveall-white club . . . but {the judge's order} means for thefirst time in 115 years the club is open to Hispanics.&quot;   Under the plan adopted by Judge Kenyon, a supervisorialdistrict represented by a retiring conservative supervisorwas redrawn to give it a Hispanic majority. The other fourdistricts would undergo minor adjustments that will generallypreserve the voter bases of two liberal and two conservativesupervisors.   Judge Kenyon's order could change 10 years of aconservative majority on the board, possibly leading tosweeping reversals on health care and social servicesspending policies. The order was the judge's solution tocorrect supervisorial boundaries that he earlier founddiscriminatory.   The decision also sets a special election for Nov. 6 forthe new Hispanic majority district and voids results of aJune primary election. The district had been represented byconservative Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who is retiring.   Judge Kenyon ruled June 4 that the board discriminatedagainst Hispanics when redrawing district boundaries afterthe 1980 census. He found the supervisors violated thefederal Voting Rights Act and ordered the board to submit aplan that would make it easier for a Hispanic win a seat.Last week, he rejected the board's proposal as &quot;nonsensical&quot;and &quot;insensitive&quot; to Hispanic and black residents.   In setting the new election date, the judge waived aresidency requirement to permit the two top June electionfinishers under the old boundaries to run as candidates inthe redrawn district. Ironically, the top vote getter wasSarah Flores, an Hispanic woman who is also a conservativeRepublican. If she were elected in November, she would becomethe first Hispanic supervisor since 1875, but the board wouldcontinue to be dominated by conservatives.   Ms. Flores, a former assistant to Mr. Schabarum, blastedthe judge's order because it voided what she called the onlyelection in the last 30 years in which a Hispanic has achance of winning.</TEXT></DOC>
