<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-75-0521 </DOCNO><TEXT>To quantify the competitive position of natural gas in industrial baking,market profiles were developed to define current technologies (singlelap, tunnel, and Lanham ovens are predominant) and to characterize theapplications and use of each technology in industrial baking. Importantcost and performance parameters were identified and validated throughinterviews with industry representatives. Two areas of research thatcould improve technologies' effectiveness are advanced burner controlsactivated based on oven load that could reduce product loss, the largestcoast associated with the oven, and cogeneration, which could penetratethe baking market if the high capital costs associated with existingequipment could be reduced.</TEXT></DOC>
