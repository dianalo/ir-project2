CLINIC LOSES $400,000 FOR PROGRAMS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;We were prepared to enter into the bidding process but we asked for threemore months, and apparently that was too much to ask,&quot; said Clifton Cole,Drew's acting executive director.;    &quot;The climate has been very negative,&quot;Cole said. &quot;There is severe prejudice against the organization that I don'tthink will get us a fair evaluation when we reapply for funding.&quot;;    SanMateo County supervisors Tom Nolan and William Schumacher voted againstletting Drew's contract out to bid before it expires.;    Tuesday's vote wasthe latest blow to Drew, the city's only public health care provider, sinceits board of directors came under fire last year amid county and federalofficials' accusations of mismanagement and conflict of interest.;    Fundingwas further jeopardized when the center's directors missed deadlines to submitmodified program proposals to county and federal officials.;    The22-year-old agency suddenly was in danger of losing services to thousands oflow-income community residents, many of whom would have nowhere else to turnfor health care.;    Late last year, the federal Department of Health andHuman Services, which provides more than $1 million in operating expenses forDrew's health clinic, demanded that the agency reorganize its board ofdirectors or risk forfeiting federal funding.;    Though Drew directors defiedthe ultimatum last month, they compromised late last week in an 11th-hourattempt to improve their funding status by allotting some seats -- but not themajority, as requested -- to new members who would better represent theminority community.;    A new chairman was voted in and three members steppeddown after serving more than 10-year terms, which violates the agency'sregulations. Two Hispanics, one white and one Pacific Islander were appointedby the board to fill vacant seats.;    Federal officials had requested thatnew board members be elected by a community coalition.;    County officialsacknowledged the directors' willingness to comply with some of their requestsand said the agency would have a fair chance in the competition for funding.;   &quot;All applications are graded on a standardized scale,&quot; said VeronicaFreeman, community service coordinator for the San Mateo County Department ofHealth Services. &quot;And with the board restructuring, Drew will have a muchbetter chance of getting the bid.&quot;;    Applications for the county contractare due Feb. 15. The new program will start in April.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SUE HUTCHISON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910109  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  472  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, January 9, 199100009170,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
