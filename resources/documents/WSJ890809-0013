Under U.S. trade laws, penalty duties can't be imposed unless the Commerce Department finds violations of the Anti-Dumping Act and the ITC finds that a domestic industry is being harmed. Dumping involves selling an item in the U.S. for less than its home-market price or its production cost.    Since 1982, the ITC has considered ordering anti-dumping duties on the imports from Taiwan at least three times. But the government trade panel concluded in each instance that the imports weren't injuring a domestic industry. The imports totaled about $10.8 million in 1988.    An ITC official said the sole U.S. producer of such motorcycle batteries is Yuasa-Exide Battery Corp., Reading, Pa., which is partly owned by a Japanese battery manufacturer. </TEXT></DOC>
