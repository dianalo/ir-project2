PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mother who fought the state so shecould bring her terminally ill 3-year-old daughter home to dielearned of her victory in the custody battle just five minutesbefore the girl died in a hospital.   ``It was a very hollow victory,'' said Sara Rahdert, an attorneywho helped Cheryl Dutchak win back little Candice.   Mrs. Dutchak fought for eight months to regain custody of herdaughter. A judge in Clearwater signed the order Monday and Ms.Rahdert rushed it to the child's room at All Children's Hospital inSt. Petersburg, about 25 miles away.   The mother read the order aloud. The hospital began preparationsto discharge the baby.   Five minutes later, Candice died.   ``It was almost like she was waiting for me to hand that order toher parents,'' Ms. Rahdert said. ``I know that sounds strange, butthat was what it was lie.''   Candice suffered health problems from birth, caused by a loss ofamniotic fluid during her mother's pregnancy. Doctors hadrecommended abortion because the baby might not live. Complicationskept her in the hospital for two months. She lost her right leg atthe knee because of circulation problems and she had failing kidneys.   Last March Candice suffered brain damage after a seizure. Doctorssaid the seizure occurred when Mrs. Dutchak withheld medication athome. Mrs. Dutchak said an emergency room doctor told her towithhold the medication.   In April the Florida Department of Health and RehablitativeServices charged Mrs. Dutchak with child abuse and took the girlaway. The child abuse charge was dropped, but the state retainedcustody until Monday.   In September HRS agreed to a compromise: If Mrs. Dutchak provedshe was a fit mother Candice could go home.   The mother did what the state asked, but it wasn't enough, Ms.Rahdert said. Earlier this month HRS officials asked a judge to adda few more requirements before Mrs. Dutchak could take Candice home.   Then Candice's condition worsened. On Monday, doctors called Mrs.Dutchak and said she was likely to die soon. Mrs. Dutchak called herlawyer who sought an emergency custody order. But HRS DistrictAdministrator Michael Becker agreed ``for humanitarian reasons'' torelease the girl to her mother, according to HRS spokeswoman ElaineFulton-Jones.   Circuit Judge Jack Page signed the order transferring custodyabout 12:45 p.m., the attorney said.   ``I dashed from the courthouse ... to the hospital ... Cherylread the order out loud stating that they did get custody back,''Ms. Rahdert said. `About five minutes after mom read this order outloud to everyone in the room, including the child, the child died.''</TEXT></DOC>
