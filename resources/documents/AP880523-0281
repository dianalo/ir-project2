(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   KaiserTech Ltd., the world'sfifth-largest aluminum producer, said Monday it had agreed to beacquired by Maxxam Group Inc. in a deal estimated at $725 million.   Under the terms of the deal, which would make KaiserTech asubsidiary of the Los Angeles-based real estate developer andlumber giant, shareholders would receive $19.375 in cash for eachshare of common stock.   KaiserTech's board of directors approved the deal at a specialmeeting Sunday, the company said.   The company's stock closed at $17.87{ a share on the New YorkStock Exchange, down 25 cents from Friday's closing.   KaiserTech, the holding company for Kaiser Aluminum andamp; ChemicalCorp., has lost money in recent years, but should make a profit in1988, one analyst said.   ``Right now, things in the (aluminum) industry are verypositive. You've got good pricing and got the industry running at100 percent capacity,'' said Sean St. Clair, an analyst with Duff andamp;Phelps Inc. in Chicago.   ``The export market has perked up for U.S. producers, given thecurrency swings, and then the U.S. share of domestic market hasincreased as imports have gone down,'' St. Clair said.   Maxxam's cash bid, which Salomon Brothers Inc. told KaiserTechwas fair, was recommended to the board by a special committeeappointed earlier this month to consider proposals to acquire theOakland-based company, said spokesman Robert W. Irelan.   KaiserTech received one other bid that proposed a leveragedbuyout from a private investment group, said Irelan, who declinedto identify the other party or discuss their bid.   Stockholders will vote on the proposed merger at a specialmeeting to be called soon, the company said.   Earlier this year, Maxxam bought 32 percent of KaiserTech'sstock from its chairman, Alan Clore, for about $200 million.   Last month, KaiserTech sued Clore and Maxxam over a dispute overrights to nominate directors. But the two companies have agreed toask that the litigation be put on hold, Irelan said.   Maxxam Group Inc., which develops real estate, also owns PacificLumber Co., the world's largest producer of redwood lumber. It hasreceived widespread criticism for speeding up the cutting ofold-growth redwoods in Northern California.   KaiserTech, which operates plants in nine states and sevenforeign countries, reported losses in five of the past six years,primarily because the recession of the early 1980s depressedaluminum prices, St. Clair said.   But the industry began to recover in 1986 when prices, which haddropped to 48 cents per pound, rose to $1.06 per pound, he said.   KaiserTech reported a net loss of $362 million or $8.11 pershare last year, compared with a loss of $39.8 million in 1986.Revenues were about $2 billion both years.   Much of that loss stemmed from the company's restructuring lastyear, Irelan said.   But in the first quarter of 1988, KaiserTech reported net incomeof $36.3 million, or 73 cents per share, on revenues of $528.3million. For the same period of 1987, KaiserTech reported a loss of$31.1 million, or 69 cents per share, on revenues of $494.2 million.   Maxxam, however, runs the risk that it could be buyingKaiserTech at a time of peak earnings and the company could be lessprofitable because of an economic slowdown predicted next year,St.Clair said.   ``I's possible KaiserTech's earnings will turn down, but I don'texpect an actual loss,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
