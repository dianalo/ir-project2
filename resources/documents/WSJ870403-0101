Among them would be making the congressional budget resolution subject to presidential approval and giving the White House the responsibility for specifying automatic cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.    At a hearing of the House Government Operations Committee, Mr. Miller noted that some of the concepts he endorsed are included in bills that have already been proposed. He said the Reagan administration is still reviewing the issue and may propose specific legislation of its own.    Mr. Miller told the committee that current budget procedures take an &quot;inordinate amount of time&quot; and lead to excessive federal spending. He said the budget resolution should be changed to a joint resolution, which requires the president's approval, from a concurrent resolution, which doesn't. A joint resolution would be binding on lawmakers in approving spending bills.    The budget director also suggested that Congress restore the automatic-cut mechanism in the Gramm-Rudman law by shifting responsibility for specifying the cuts to the budget office from the Comptroller General. The Supreme Court struck down the mechanism on the ground that it unconstitutionally allowed a legislative branch official, the Comptroller General, to perform executive branch functions.    Mr. Miller also said he would resist efforts to narrow the spending base from which the automatic cuts must come.    Legislation to address the Gramm-Rudman issue is likely to be attached to a measure that will be needed next month to raise the federal debt ceiling. It isn't clear, however, whether Mr. Miller's approach on this or other matters will be acceptable to lawmakers.    In addition, Mr. Miller suggested that Congress consider adopting a two-year budget, rather than one year as at present, and expanding the president's authority to rescind appropriations. He would require Congress to vote on proposals to rescind budget authority; currently such proposals automatically die if Congress hasn't acted on them in 45 days.    Mr. Miller also said he wants appropriations committees barred from changing the way funds are allocated between defense and civilian matters in the budget. He also called for studying the possibility of having automatic continuing resolutions, which finance the government pending the enactment of appropriations bills. Delays in approving such resolutions have disrupted the government in recent years.    In addition, Mr. Miller repeated the administration's call for constitutional amendments to balance the budget and give the president authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills.    He also called for enactment of proposals to require explicit congressional appropriation of the amounts of subsidies that are inherent in federal loan and loan-guarantee programs. </TEXT></DOC>
