During the next century, theoretical simulationsproject that global average temperatures will rise by several degreesCelsius above their pre-industrial baseline and that precipitation patternsmay shift seasonally and spatially. Although research is being intensifiedso that detailed regional estimates can be provided, projected increasesin summer temperatures and the accompanying increased evaporation, especiallyduring natural warm excursions such as the summer of 1988, appear topose troubling conditions for water supplies, agriculture, transport,and other activities dependent on water resources. 9 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
