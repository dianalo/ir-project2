The SEC charged late in June that Fred Lee, a Taiwanese businessman, made more than $19 million of illegal profit by trading on inside information provided to him by Mr. Wang, an analyst on mergers and acquisitions for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Mr. Wang was suspended by the firm in the wake of the charges.    Mr. Wang consented to the order, which also bars him from destroying or concealing financial records. The order also requires that Mr. Wang file with the court an accounting of assets held in his name, or in which he has an interest, from July 1, 1987, to the present; of accounts in his name, or over which he exercised control, with financial institutions or brokerage concerns; of securities transactions in such accounts; and of transactions in which assets were transferred between Mr. Wang and Mr. Lee. </TEXT></DOC>
