(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Up to 600 members of two rival NavajoIndian factions and tribal police clashed Thursday night, resultingin the shooting death of one man and injuries to 10 other people,witnesses and officials said.   Two hundred to 300 supporters of suspended tribal Chairman PeterMacDonald occupied the tribe's business and finance building lateThursday after a pro-MacDonald rally that turned violent,authorities said.   The violence in this tribal capital near the Arizona-New Mexicoline was the latest episode in the struggle for power on the NavajoReservation. With 200,000 members the Navajos are the nation'slargest Indian tribe.   A federal Bureau of Indian Affairs tactical team was workingwith tribal police and the FBI was expected to arrive at the remotereservation Friday morning, said Steve Goldstein, a spokesman forInterior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. in Washington.   Jimmy Dixon of Indian Wells, Ariz., died at the U.S. PublicHealth Service Hospital in nearby Fort Defiance, said Willie KeetoJr. and Howard Bitsuie, co-presidents of MacDonald's group, thePro-Dineh Voters.   Six people suffered gunshot wounds and six others suffered otherinjuries, officials said.   Hospital workers and tribal police refused to confirm the reportof a fatal shooting.   However, Goldstein said officials had been notified that oneperson had been killed and three wounded.   According to Goldstein, tribal Police Chief George John was inWashington and pro-MacDonald forces were to trying to reinstateformer Police Chief Wilbur Kellogg.   ``There was a march to police headquarters,'' the spokesman said.   Around 5:45 p.m., members of the pro-MacDonald crowd of 200 to300 people attacked and beat tribal poliice Lt. Daniel Hawkins,police said. They said someone in the crowd took Hawkins' gun andshot two other officers.   Witnesses said Dixon shot tribal police Sgt. Daniel Lee ofWindow Rock with a police revolver taken from an officer during thefracas. Another officer then shot Dixon, witnesses said.   Lee was in critical condition at the Fort Defiance hospital,where he, Dixon and three other Navajos were taken, according toPro-Dineh officials and others.   Tribal spokeswoman LeNora Begay identified the other wounded astribal policeman Emerson Jake of Kayenta, Ariz., and demonstratorsArnold Begay and Ashkie Bahe.   Jake was beaten and handcuffed when he approached thepro-MacDonald rally, said LeNora Began, who is not related toArnold Begay.   Members of the pro-MacDonald crowd used clubs to break into thebusiness office and were holding off a similar-size crowd outside,witnesses said.   The business and finance building and another building wereclose at noon Thursday because of threats of an attack on thebuildings, officials said.   The MacDonald supporters had been camped just outside of townall day, witnesses said.   ``Dineh'' is a Navajo word meaning ``the people.''   MacDonald issued an order instructing Kellogg to take over aspolice chief and ``restore law and order'' on the reservation.   MacDonald's whereabouts could not be determined Thursday night.   The situation in Window Rock has been volatile since the88-member Tribal Council began its Winter Meeting in mid-February.   Dissidents who had seen MacDonald accused during televised U.S.Senate hearings of official corruption and misconduct went into themeeting vowing to remove him from office.   Late Feb. 13, a 49-member council majority voted to placeMacDonald on administrative leave.   MacDonald, who has denied any wrongdoing, balked at leavingoffice after the council refused to consider paying his legal fees.Throughout March and April he continued to act as chairman for adwindling group of supporters.   On March 10, the council appointed Leonard Haskie interimchairman.   Haskie and his departmental appointees eventually managed to winrecognition from Citibank of Arizona and from the Bureau of IndianAffairs' local office as the tribe's chief executive. A tribaljudge in Window Rock District Court also ruled for Haskie. By May,Haskie and his appointees had taken hold of the tribal government'sreins.</TEXT></DOC>
