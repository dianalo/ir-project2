The Proposed Decision sets forth the procedures that theDOE has tentatively formulated to distribute crude oil overcharge fundsobtained from Salomon, Inc., Coral Petroleum, Inc., International CrudeCorporation, and Conoco, Inc. The funds are being held in interest-bearingescrows accounts pending distribution by the DOE.The DOE has tentatively decided to distribute these funds in accordancewith the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning CrudeOil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the Modified Policy, crudeoil overcharge monies are divided among the states, the federal government,and injured purchasers of refined products. Under the plan we are proposing,refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state'sconsumption of petroleum products during the period of price controls.Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the number of gallonsof petroleum products which they purchased and the extent to which theycan demonstrate injury.Applications for refund should not be filed at this time. Appropriate publicnotice will be given when the submission of claims is authorized.Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposedrefund procedures. Commenting parties are requested to submit two copiesof their comments. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and should be sent to the address set forth atthe beginning of this notice. All comments received will be available forpublic inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday throughFriday, except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Officeof Hearings and Appeals, located in room 1E-234, 1000 Independence Avenue,SW., Washington, DC 20585.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 14, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George B.

These procedures are used to refund monies to those injuredby actual or alleged violations of the DOE price regulations.The ERA has filed four Petitions for the Implementation of Special RefundProcedures for crude oil overcharge funds obtained from Salomon, Inc.,Coral Petroleum, Inc., International Crude Corporation and Conoco Inc.\1\<NOTE/> These four firms remitted a total of $28,217,343 to the DOE.\2\<NOTE/> An additional $4,644,590 in interest has accrued on thatamount as of July 31, 1988. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forththe OHA's plan to distribute these funds. Comments are solicited.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ On December 12, 1985, the OHA issued a Decision and Orderconcerning the petition to implement refund procedures for $11 millionin crude oil overcharge funds and $3 million in petroleum product overchargefunds obtained from Conoco Inc. pursuant to a court approved settlement.<T3>Conoco Inc.,</T3> 13 DOE andpara; 85,316 (1985). One crude oil refundof $135,846 was granted to a direct purchaser of crude oil in that proceeding.<T3>See Conoco Inc./Delmarva Power, </T3>17 DOE andpara; 85,622 (1988). Wenow propose to distribute the $10,864,154 in residual funds in the Conocoescrow account, plus accrued interest, pursuant to the procedures set forthin this Decision.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In addition to the $10,864,154 in the Conoco escrow-fund,Salomon, Inc. remitted $16,250,000 to the DOE pursuant to a March 24, 1988Consent Order between Salomon and the DOE, Consent, Order number 6COX00249W;Coral Petroleum, Inc. remitted $1,000,000 pursuant to a settlement approvedon February 8, 1988, Consent Order Number 650X00320W; and InternationalCrude Corporation remitted a total of $103,188.89 pursuant to a ConsentOrder entered into between its president, Gregg Pritchard and the DOE for$36,093.09, Consent Order Number 6A0X00327W, and an award by the bankruptcytrustee of International Crude Corp. for $67,095.80.The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implementa plan to distribute refunds are set forth in 10 CFR Part 205, SubpartV. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannotreadily identify the persons who may have been injured as a result of actualor alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of therefund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of SubpartV and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds,see <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>9 DOE andpara; 82,508 (1981), and <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>8 DOE andpara; 82,597 (1981). We have consideredthe ERA's requests to implement Subpart V procedures with respect to themonies received from the four firms listed above, and have determined thatsuch procedures are appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Background</ITAG>On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of RestitutionaryPolicy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (``theMSRP''). The MSRP, issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreementin <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>M.D.L. No. 378 (D. Kan.), provides that crude oil overcharge fundswill be divided among the states, the federal government, and injured purchasersof refined petroleum products. Under the MSRP, up to 20 percent of thesecrude oil overcharge funds will be reserved initially to satisfy validclaims by injured purchasers of petroleum products. Eighty percent of thefunds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are tobe disbursed equally to the states and federal government for indirectrestitution.The OHA has been applying the MSRP to all Subpart V proceedings involvingalleged crude oil violations. <T3>See</T3> Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986).That Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of any objectionsto the application of the MSRP, and solicited comments concerning the appropriateprocedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refundproceedings. On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous commentswhich it received in response to the August 1986 Order. 52 FR 11737. TheNotice set forth generalized procedures and provided guidance to assistclaimants that wish to file refund applications for crude oil monies underthe Subpart V regulations. All applicants for refunds would be requiredto document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the periodof Federal crude oil price controls and to prove that they were injuredby the alleged overcharges. The Notice indicated that end-users of petroleumproducts whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry wouldbe presumed to have absorbed the crude oil overcharges, and need not submitany further proof of injury to receive a refund. Finally, we stated thatrefunds would be calculated on the basis of a per gallon refund amountderived by dividing crude oil violation amounts by the total consumptionof petroleum products in the United States during the period of price controls.The numerator would consist of crude oil overcharge monies that were inthe DOE's escrow account at the time of the M.D.L. 378 settlement, or weresubsequently deposited in the escrow account, and a portion of the fundsin the M.D.L. 378 escrow at the time of the settlement. The DOE has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April1987 Notice, <T3>see, e.g., Shell Oil Co.,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,204 (1988) (<T3>Shell Oil</T3>), and <T3>Ernest A. Allerkamp,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,079 (1988) (<T3>Allerkamp</T3>), and the procedures have been approved by the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Kansas. Various States had fileda Motion with that Court, claiming that the OHA violated the SettlementAgreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperlycalculating the ``refund amount to be used in those proceedings. On August17, 1987, the Court issued an Opinion and Order denying the States' Motionin its entirety. The Court concluded that the Settlement Agreement ``doesnot bar OHA from permitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptionsin affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling them to a refund.'' <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>671 F. Supp. 1318, 1323 (D. Kan. 1987). The Court also ruled that, as specifiedin the April 1987 Notice, the OHA could calculate refunds based on a portionof the M.D.L. 378 overcharges. The latter ruling was recently affirmedby the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>3 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 26,604. <ITAG tagnum="81">II. The Proposed Refund Procedures </ITAG>A. <T3>Refund Claims.</T3> We now propose to apply the procedures discussedin the April 1987 Notice to the crude oil Subpart V proceedings that arethe subject of the present determination. As noted above, $28,217,343 inalleged crude oil violation amounts is covered by this Proposed Decision.We have decided to reserve initially the full 20 percent of the allegedcrude oil violation amounts, or $5,643,469 (plus interest) for direct refundsto claimants, in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be availablefor refunds to injured parties. The amount of the reserve may be adjusteddownward later if circumstances warrant. The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on allegedcrude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has usedin Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overchargesinvolving refined products. <T3>See Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,</T3> 14 DOE andpara; 85,475 (1986) (<T3>Mountain Fuel</T3>). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will berequired to document their purchase volumes and to prove that they wereinjured as a result of the alleged violations. Applicants who were end-usersor ultimate consumers of petroleum products, whose businesses are unrelatedto the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulationsare presumed to have absorbed rather than passed on alleged crude oil overcharges.In order to receive a refund, end-users need not submit any further evidenceof injury beyond volumes of product purchased during the period of crudeoil price controls. <T3>See A. Tarricone,</T3> 15 DOE andpara; 85,495 at 88,893-96 (1987). Resellerand retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury, and maynot rely on the presumptions of injury utilized in refund cases involvingrefined petroleum products. <T3>Id.</T3> They can, however, use econometric evidence of the type employedin the OHA Report to the District Court in the Stripper Well Litigation,6 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 90,507 (June 19, 1985). Applicants whoexecuted and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows establishedin the Settlement Agreement have waived their rights to apply for crudeoil refunds under Subpart V. <T3>See Boise Cascade Corp.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,214 at 88,411 <T3>reconsideration denied,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,494 (1987); <T3>Sea-Land Service, Inc.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,496 at 88,991 n.1 (1987).Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined petroleum productswill be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived bydividing the crude oil violation amounts involved in this determination($28,217,343) by the total consumption of petroleum products in the UnitedStates during the period of price controls (2,020,997,335,000 gallons).<T3>See Mountain Fuel,</T3> 14 DOE at 88,868. This approach reflects thefact that crude oil overcharges were spread equally throughout the countryby the Entitlements Program.\3\<NOTE/> This yields a volumetric refund amount of $0.00001396 pergallon for the four proceedings involved in this determination. We proposeto adopt a deadline of October 31, 1989 for refund applications submittedpursuant to this Decision.<T3> See World Oil Corp.,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,658 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Department of Energy established the EntitlementsProgram to equalize access to the benefits of crude oil price controlsamong all domestic refiners and their downstream customers. To accomplishthis goal, refiners were required to make transfer payments among themsevesthrough the purchase and sale of ``entitlements.'' This balancing mechanismhad the effect of evenly disbursing overcharges resulting from crude oilmiscertifications throughout the domestic refining industry. <T3>See</T3> Amber Refining Inc., 13 DOE andpara; 85,217 at 88,564 (1985).As we stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will berequired to submit only one application for crude oil overcharge funds.<T3>See Allerkamp,</T3> 17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previouslysubmitted a refund application in crude oil refund proceedings need notfile another application. A deadline of June 30, 1988 was established forall first stage crude oil refund proceedings implemented pursuant to theMSRP up to and including <T3>Shell Oil. See A. Tarricone, Inc.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,681 (1987);<T3>Allerkamp,</T3> 17 DOE at 88,178; <T3>Shell Oil,</T3> 17 DOE at 88,408. Any applicant that files a refundapplication after that deadline will be eligible to receive a refund basedonly on the volumetric amounts approved subsequent to that date in thesecond stage of disbursements. This volumetric refund amount will be increasedas additional crude oil violation amounts are received in the future. Applicantsmay be required to submit additional information to document their refundclaims for these future amounts. Notice of any additional amounts availablein the future will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. B. <T3>Payments to the States and Federal Government.</T3> Under the termsof the MSRP, we propose that the remaining 80 percent of the alleged crudeoil violation amounts subject to this Proposed Decision, or $22,573,874plus interest, be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal governmentfor indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion tothe consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period ofprice controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receiveis contained in Exhibit H of the Settlement Agreement. These funds willbe subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all othercrude oil monies received by the state under the Settlement Agreement.Before taking the actions we have proposed in this Decision, we intendto publicize our proposal and solicit comments on it. Comments regardingthe tentative distribution process set forth in this Proposed Decisionand Order should be filed with the OHA within 30 days of its publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <T3>It is Therefore Ordered That:</T3> The refund amounts remitted to the Department of Energy by Salomon, Inc.,Coral Petroleum Inc., International Crude Corporation and Conoco Inc. pursuantto the Consent Orders executed respectively on March 24, 1988, February8, 1988, July 1, 1985 and November 14, 1983 will be distributed in accordancewith the foregoing Decision.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-21462 Filed 9-19-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
