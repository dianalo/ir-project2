The New York Court of Appeals overturned two lower courtsin throwing out a lawsuit filed by Intershoe Inc., aMillersburg, Pa., shoe importer, against Bankers Trust Co., aunit of Bankers Trust New York Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Intershoe and Bankers Trust entered into a foreigncurrency futures transaction over the phone March 13, 1985,involving Italian lira. But the two parties disagreed aboutthe nature of the deal. The confirmation slip, sent byBankers Trust the day of the transaction, showed thatIntershoe had agreed to sell the bank lira for $250,000. ButIntershoe argued that, in fact, it had agreed over the phoneto buy -- not sell -- the lira.   According to the decision, the company's treasurer said hewas sure he had not agreed to sell lira to the bank, eventhough he had signed the confirmation slip and returned it tothe bank. The treasurer said that Intershoe had sold foreigncurrency to Bankers Trust in only one of almost 1,000currency transactions, according to the decision.   The appeals court ruled that under the Uniform CommercialCode, the confirmation slip nonetheless constituted the finalexpression of the deal and that no contrary evidence based ona prior agreement could be introduced in court. The judgesrejected Intershoe's argument that the confirmation slipshould have included some indication that the partiesintended it to be the final expression of the deal.   &quot;As a practical matter, a confirmation slip or similarwriting is usually the only reliable evidence of suchtransactions, given the unlikely prospect that one who makesscores of similar deals each day will remember the details ofany one particular agreement,&quot; the court wrote in itsopinion.   David M. Satnick, who represented Bankers Trust, said thedecision &quot;lends certainty&quot; to such transactions. A ruling tothe contrary &quot;would have opened up a Pandora's Box oflitigation,&quot; said Mr. Satnick, of the New York law firm Mosesandamp; Singer.   Intershoe's counsel, Thomas G. Rozinski of the New Yorklaw firm Anderson Kill Olick andamp; Oshinsky, said he wasdisappointed with the decision but that there aren't furtheravenues for appeal.   ---   ANTI-SEMITIC harassment results in $1.8 million juryverdict in Chicago case.   The award was believed to be the highest ever underIllinois's hate-crime law and one of the highest such awardsnationally, according to the Anti-Defamation League of B'naiB'rith of Chicago. Illinois is one of at least 15 states withhate-crime laws that permit enhanced civil damages forbias-related offenses.   The verdict came in a lawsuit brought by Sherry Del Dotto,who is Jewish, and her husband, Larry, a Roman Catholic,against two former next-door neighbors. The suit complainedthat the neighbors engaged in &quot;a continuing campaign ofintimidation, threats and harassment&quot; that included paintinganti-Semitic epithets on a car and bombarding the couple withreligious and racial verbal abuse.   At one point, according to the Del Dottos' attorney, theneighbors pinned Mrs. Del Dotto's car between their vehiclesfor three weeks. The neighbors, Neil Olsen, and his mother,Lucille, also blasted the Del Dottos with loud music thatkept their daughter from sleeping, said attorney EdwinRothschild. His firm, Sonnenschein, Nath andamp; Rosenthal ofChicago, represented the Del Dottos on a pro bono basis.   The harassment began in 1984 and continued despiterepeated warnings from police until the Del Dottos movedabout a year later, Mr. Rothschild said.   Neither the defendants nor their lawyer could be reachedfor comment. Mr. Rothschild said the defendants are notwell-to-do and aren't expected to be able to pay the bulk ofthe damages.   ---   TEXAS LEGISLATURE gets two more weeks to revamppublic-school funding.   Texas is one of four states in which the top state courthas ordered reforms of school-funding mechanisms afterfinding that existing systems violate state constitutionalguarantees of equal educational opportunities for allstudents.   Texas legislators were under an order to draw up aconstitutionally sound financing plan by yesterday. But incourt in Austin, lawyers for the state asked for a two-monthextension of the court's deadline. Lawyers for the plaintiffs-- 13 property-poor school districts -- countered with arequest for a court order to halt all expenditures of stateand local school funds, except to make necessary bondpayments.   Both requests were taken under consideration by stateJudge F. Scott McCown, who scheduled another hearing forApril 15. In the meantime, a court-appointed expert willreview a plan for the court to take control of the schoolfunding system, a contingency if the legislature doesn'tproduce an acceptable plan of its own.   The Texas Legislature reconvenes today and is expected toreconsider plans it previously rejected. State Sen. CarlParker, chairman of the Senate education committee, sounded anote of caution for his colleagues: &quot;Challenging the courtsat this point is simply being macho or being very dumb,&quot; hesaid.   ---   PARAMOUNT loses another round in legal fight with ArtBuchwald.   A state court judge in Los Angeles rejected ParamountPictures Corp.'s request that it be allowed to offer moreevidence to bolster its argument that it had played fair inits contract dealings with the columnist. The company is aunit of Paramount Communications Inc.   Late last year, the judge ruled that Paramount Picturesforced Mr. Buchwald into an &quot;unconscionable&quot; net profitagreement in the contract involving the movie &quot;Coming toAmerica,&quot; which was based on a Buchwald idea. The rulingmarked one of the few times that a court has thrown out astandard movie contract.   A spokesman for Paramount said the movie studio contendsthat it was never given a chance to offer evidence onspecific portions of the contract.   &quot;We believe the judge was wrong. We believe we have beendenied our opportunity to present evidence that would justifythe contract. At some point we will have that opportunity, ifnecessary on appeal,&quot; said Harry Anderson, vice president,corporate communications, at Paramount.   Pierce O'Donnell, an attorney for Mr. Buchwald, said:&quot;We're thrilled. . . .We are confident that any appeal willbe denied and that we will secure a substantial damageverdict. Paramount's defense is in shambles.&quot;   He noted there will be a third trial within a few monthsto set the amount of final damages.   ---   GUILTY PLEA entered in case involving alleged insidertrading in thrift stocks.
