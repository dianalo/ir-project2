 An Interior Department member will chair FGDC.andM;Other members will come from the departments of Agriculture, Commerce,Defense, Energy, housing and Urban development, State and Transfortation;Federal Emergency Management Agency; Environmental Protection Agency; NASA;and National Archives and Records Administration.andP;  The first meeting willtake place this winter.andM;While the FICCDC-proposed circular was under review, its Requirements WorkingGroup, chaired by Peggy Harwood of the Forest Service, was &quot;attempting todevelop a model for each of the 10 anticipated data categories,&quot; Harwoodsaid.andM;Data category subcommittees may be formed to support the lead departments.andO;The Subcommittees would have cross-cutting working groups on standards,technology exchange and liaison.andP;  except for some dedicated staff at the NMD,agency participation is voluntary.andM;To meet the coodinated needs, NMD has proposed an Office of Geographic DataCoordination, similar to the Office of Water Data Coordination in the WaterResources Division.andM;Geographic information systems data and standards development efforts havebeen under way for more than a decade.andM;Gift to NationandM;The Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER)database, the nation's first complete digital reference at a scale of 1 to100,000 resulted from an agreement between the Census Bureau and theGeological Survey.andP;  It has been called &quot;a gift to the nation.&quot;andM;Individual agencies are developing their own digital database by digitizingor scanning maps, and cooperative digital data development projects also areemerging.andM;Federal remote-sensing activities have made satellite imagery available, withfunding assured for the launch of Landsat 6 and advanced desigh for Landsat7.andM;The Global Change Initiative in one of a few federal programs with increasedfunding for natural resources data development.andM;Private-sector funding also is increasing; Massachusetts' color infraredaerial photography program has support from federal, state, local, academicand private-sector contributors.andM;In the standards area, the National Istitute of Standards and Technology willannounce a proposal spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) around the first ofthe year.andM;After commet and appovals, SDTS will become a Federal Information ProcessingStandard Henry Tom, manager of NIST's GIS Standards Laboratory, said the newFIPS &quot;will be the first official comprehensive mechanism for GIS-related datainterchange.&quot;andM;Data standards have won notive in recent reviews of GIS procurements proposedby the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service.andP;  For example, the JointAppropriations Committee on Oct. 26 authorized BLM to spend $1.5 million todevelop quality control procedures and data standards.andM;Agencies have taken various approached to standards.andP;  For example, EPA hadadopted a Locational Data Policy (LDP).andP;  EPA's Jeff Booth said,&quot;Environmental data is inherently geographic, and EPA is the largest civilianconsumer of spatial data.&quot;andM;The LDP sets methods for latitude and longitude coordinates of entities underEPA regulation.andP;  The agency is determining what level of locational accuracyit will require in all existing and future data gathering.andM;Efforts to identify GIS activity also have grown recently.andP;  A 1988 survey byFICCDC found that 37 responding federal organizations either use GIS orintend to do so.andP;  An OMB report last year said total proposed expenditures onelectronic mapping databases by non-defense agencies for the years throughfiscal 1992 total more than $750 million.andP;  Jack Arthur of OMB said thatfigure &quot;only touches the tip of the iceberg.&quot;andM;Role of CoordinatorandM;The National Academy of Sciences Mapping Sciences Committee's 1990 report onspatial data needs suggested the most important function of USGS' NationalMapping Division in the future will be to &quot;act as the federal coordinator ofthe national geographic data infrastructure -- not just to produce maps andderive digital data.&quot;andM;The report stated, &quot;We can expect substantial redundancy and excessive costif unccordinated, under-standardized, local database building continuesunchecked.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, the oversight agencies keep close tabs on GIS activity.andP;  Forexample, OMB has directed BLM to scale back its procurement of a land andminerals recor system.andP;  The agency will develop and test a prototype of thecore system, with a revised RFP to be issued in the spring and an award byAugust 1992.andP;  According to OMB's Arthur, BLM needed &quot;to establish credibilityand accountability through a track records.&quot;andM;A June Accounting Office report for the House Appropriations Subcommittee onInterior and Related Agencies concluded that the Forest Service &quot;is not readyto procure a $1.2 billion nationwide GIS.&quot;andM;GAO said the functional requirements analysis, feasibility study andcost/benefit analysis did not address how best to harness GIS technology orwhat organizational changes likely will occur from a GIS.andM;The subcommittee agreed with GAO's recommendation for further evaluation ofalternatives and a more comprehensive functional requirements analysis.andO;House and Senate conferances said on Oct. 26 that the Forest Service shoulduse up to $1 million of the request for outside review of the studies andanalyses that led to the RFP.andM;It is indeed difficult to assess the costs, benefits and interagency impactsof GIS in view of potential redundancy and incompatibility.andP;  Some havesuggested that BLM and the Forest Service, two of the largest land owners inthe country, should swap land holdings to enhance efficiency in fieldoperations.andM;An estimated 80 percent or more of GIS cost lies in data generation andhandling.andP;  Federal agencies frequently need the data generated by lowerlevels of government.andM;Federal representatives are becoming more active in policy and technicalcoordination groups established by the states.andP;  Some federal agencies havevoting authority, and sometimes feds even chair such groups.andM;In Montana this year, 15 federal and state agencies signed a memorandum ofunderstanding to coordinate GIS activities.andP;  The Montana Interagency GISManagement Steering Committee is led by Marvin LeNoue, state BLM director.andO;The Montana Interagency GIS Technical Working Group is headed by Don Luse ofthe Bureau of Indian Affairs.andM;The Northwest LAnd Information Systems Network, a partnership between federaland state agency representatives in Oregon and Washington, works out costsharing and data responsibility agreements to cut redundancy and storagecosts.andP;  The network is co-chaired by Paul Vederick, deputy state BLMdirector, and Dick Swinderton, director of NMD's Western Mapping Center inMenlo Park, Calif.andM;Six agencies have agreed to build a common database and digital index in apilot project for the Grand Rond River, a recently designated wild, scenicriver located in both those states.andP;  &quot;We will superimpose data from a varietyof sources, and we want to reflect the best data available, even originalsurvey notes,&quot; Vederick said.andM;Lisa Warnecke, a Syracuse, N.Y., consultant on land information development,is principal investigator for the Council of State Governments' project toproduce a State Geographic Information Activities Compendium.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
