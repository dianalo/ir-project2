From 1970 to 1973, the price doubled toabout $3 per barrel; in 1973-1974 it quadrupled to $12; in 1979-1980it tripled to $36; in 1986 it collapsed to $10 before leveling off ataround $18 (all prices in then current dollars). These large and rapidprice swings, generally unpredicted, have caused great economic damageto oil consumers and to many producers. Both groups would prefer a stableprice that permits more rational economic planning. Governments, in particularthe US government, have tried to stabilize prices at various times andin various ways. Since 1973, the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC) has tried to set the world price. From 1971 to 1980,the US government enforced price controls on domestically produced oil,with unfortunate consequences. While direct price-setting has not beengenerally successful, other policies could affect the price indirectlyby influencing oil supply and demand. For example, OPEC members raisedthe price by withholding production, and consumer governments restraineddemand by imposing consumption taxes. In this article the authors examinemainly three policy tools used in the United States and many other consumernations: (a) tax policies affecting both consumption and production ofoil; (b) import restrictions, such as tariffs or quotas; (c) and theuse of a strategic petroleum reserve (SPR), which inevitably influencesthe price.</TEXT></DOC>
