This line is located at the Gehl facility in Washington County, Wisconsin.Washington County, Wisconsin, is designated attainment for ozone undersection 107 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7407. See 40 CFR 81.350. However, recentair quality data for this County show exceedances and a violation of theozone standard. Further, Wisconsin took credit for the RACT-level VOC emissionlimitations that it now seeks to relax in its demonstration of attainmentfor the SIP for the designated ozone nonattainment areas in SoutheasternWisconsin that the State submitted to satisfy Part D of the Act, 42 U.S.C.7501 <T3>et seq. </T3>USEPA relied on that demonstration in approving the State'sPart D plan for those areas. In a May 26, 1988, letter USEPA notified theGovernor of Wisconsin that the SIP for Washington County, inter alia, wassubstantially inadequate to achieve the ozone standard.Under the existing federally approved SIP for Wisconsin, Gehl's metal partsand products dip coating line is subject to the requirements containedin Natural Resources (NR) section 154.13(4)(m)3, Wisconsin AdministrativeCode, which limits the VOC content of the coating used to not more than4.8 pounds per gallon of coating, excluding water, by December 31, 1982,and 3.5 pounds per gallon of coating, excluding water, by December 31,1985. USEPA approved these rules on January 11, 1980 (45 FR 2319), andJune 21, 1982 (47 FR 26622).WDNR reported that Gehl's spray booths are meeting the 3.5 pounds of VOCper gallon of coating, excluding water, limit. An air-dried coating isapplied in the dip tank which presently meets the interim limitation of4.8 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, excluding water, but does notmeet the final limitation of 3.5 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, excludingwater. Gehl has maintained that it is not technically and economicallyfeasible to meet the final limitation for the dip tank. It has requestedan alternative limitation for the dip tank coating of 4.8 pounds of VOCper gallon of coating, excluding water.WDNR's submittal discusses the technical and economic feasibility of sixtypes of compliant coating, the economic feasibility of add-on control,and the effect of the relaxation on attainment and maintenance of the ozonenational ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). WDNR's analysis is discussedin USEPA's technical support document dated March 30, 1987. This documentis available in the Region V Office noted above.In a May 31, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 19806) notice, USEPA proposed to disapprovethis revision to Wisconsin's ozone SIP, primarily because the State hasnot demonstrated that the revision will not jeopardize attainment or maintenanceof the ozone standard in Washington County and in the non-attainment areasin Southeastern Wisconsin.Comments on this notice of proposed rulemaking were received from Gehland from the WDNR. These comments and USEPA's response are provided below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Gehl's June 27, 1988, Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>The Increase In VOC Emissions Above RACT Is Negligible.If USEPA approved the variance, the ``additional emissions'' resultingfrom the variance would be 4.32 tons of VOC per year (TPY). (See, WDNRMemo of August 14, 1987.) This amount is negligible by any measure.The WDNR's most recent Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) Report for theyear 1986, issued January 1988, indicates that 61,147 TPY of VOCs wereemitted in the Southeast Wisconsin Ozone nonattainment area in the year1986. The 4.32 TPY excess above RACT (if transfer efficiency of Gehl'sdip tank is not considered) proposed by Gehl would be 0.007 percent ofthe total VOCs emitted. Similarly, for 1987, non-RACT stationary sourcesreported 3,947 tons.<T3>USEPA's Response.</T3> USEPA does not consider any increase in VOCemissions to be ``negligible''. The same argument could be made for themajority of individual sources in the 61,147 TPY inventory; and, thus,if relaxations were approved on this basis, significant reductions in theSoutheastern Wisconsin ozone levels would not occur.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>Granting the Revision Results in Fewer, Not Greater,VOC Emissions. The only alternative to using 4.8 paint (pounds of VOC pergallon of coating, excluding water) in the dip tank, which would allowGehl to continue operations in West Bend, is to increase its spray boothoperations, because lower VOC paint cannot be used in dip tank operations.Tests at the Gehl Company, witnessed by the WDNR, showed that the sprayingprocess has a transfer efficiency of 21.6 percent when using 3.5 paint(pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, excluding water). The transfer efficiencyfor the dip tank, however, is 87.6 percent with 4.8 paint.The result of the lower transfer efficiency for spraying is that increasingspraying with 3.5 paints would actually result in increased VOC emissionsof 11.0 TPY. Since increased spraying with 3.5 paint is allowable, denyingthe variance would be counterproductive.<T3>USEPA's Response. </T3>Because USEPA generally does not place restrictionson production in approving VOC RACT limitations, an increase in the allowableemission rate (from 3.5 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, excludingwater to 4.8 pounds of VOC per gallon coating, excluding water) representsan increase in allowable emissions. Obviously, in such a situation it ispossible for actual emissions to increase, based on the actual amount ofcoating used. Although the commentor states that granting the revisionwill result in fewer emissions, this has not been demonstrated to be thecase. First, Gehl has provided no support for its claim that the transferefficiency of its dip tank is 87.6 percent. In addition, it has not beendemonstrated that switching to spray painting is the only feasible alternativeto using paint in the dip tank with a VOC content of 4.8 pounds of VOCper gallon of coating, excluding water.<T3>Comment 3. </T3>USEPA's Concern that Granting the Variance May ImpactUpon the Timely Attainment of the SIP is Totally Unfounded.The stated basis for denying the SIP revision was that the State had failedto show that the SIP for Washington County and nonattainment areas willstill assure timely attainment and maintenance, despite the relaxationrequested. In the USEPA's technical support document of March 30, 1987,the USEPA noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">For this reason, the State must demonstrate that any SIP relaxationin Washington County, along with the ozone precursor emissions from theother counties in the demonstration areas, does not contribute significantlyto the downwind ozone standard violation in Southeastern Wisconsin. WDNRcould do this by updating the growth margin contained in the 1982 ozoneSIP and showing that the emissions from the dip tank above the SIP-allowable,can be offset using the updated growth margin.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">As noted above, the ``excess emission'' resulting from the varianceis a mere 4.32 TPY. Yet, at the same time, the RFP report for 1986 demonstratesthat Wisconsin is substantially ahead of its ozone plan. In fact, the reportindicates that Wisconsin is 2,668 tons ahead of its target levels for 1986(the last year for which data is available). It is totally inconceivablethat, given the progress made to date, the additional 4.32 TPY will haveany impact upon the State's ability to remain on or ahead of its SIP targetfor ozone.<T3>USEPA's Response. </T3>The March 30, 1987, technical support documentprovided an evaluation of one possible means of demonstrating that therevision will not jeopardize attainment or maintenance of the ozone standard.On May 26, 1988, USEPA Notified the Governor of Wisconsin that the SIPfor this area was substantially inadequate to achieve the ozone standard.Therefore, a demonstration based on the growth margin contained in Wisconsin's1982 plan is no longer adequate.<T3>Comment 4. </T3>Gehl has Demonstrated Compliance with the Terms ofthe Proposed Variance to date. Under the terms of the proposed variance,Gehl would be only allowed to utilize the dip tank, provided that VOC emissionsnot exceed 4.8 pounds per gallon; and the total emissions from the facilitywere limited to 12.88 TPY. Thus far, Gehl has remained in compliance withthis requirement.<T3>USEPA's Response. </T3>The fact that Gehl is in compliance with theterms of the variance has no bearing on whether the revision can be approved.<T3>Comment 5.</T3> Other Alternatives Remain Technically and EconomicallyUnfeasible. In its March 30, 1987, technical support document, the USEPAquestioned the technical and economic feasibility of alternatives. TheWDNR and Gehl responded with additional information, copies of which wereforwarded to USEPA on October 15, 1987. Given the statements made in USEPA'sMay 31, 1988, proposed decision, we understand the disapproval was notbased upon a failure to show technical and economic infeasibility. Nevertheless,Gehl Company wishes to assure the USEPA that in fact, other options remaintechnically and economically infeasible. <T3>USEPA's Response.</T3> USEPA does not agree that other alternativesare technically or economically infeasible (as discussed in the March 30,1987, technical support document). However, the proposed disapproval wasnot based on failure to make such a demonstration, because RACT regulationswere not required by USEPA in Washington County as a part of Wisconsin's1979/1982 Milwaukee ozone SIP. Therefore, the only demonstration requiredis that the revision will not jeopardize attainment or maintenance of theozone standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. WDNR's June 28, 1988, Comments </ITAG><T3>Comment 1.</T3> Emissions from painting operations at the Gehl Companywere included in the 1980 base year for Wisconsin's 1982 SIP revision.The SIP projected that at RACT in 1987 (assuming 1980 annual throughput),the dip tank emissions would be reduced to 9.3 tons; and the paint reducersolvent would be reduced to 2.99 tons. The SIP also included a 10 percentgrowth accommodation between 1980 and 1987. Thus, if allocated on a persource basis, the Gehl 1987 dip tank and reducer solvent emissions wouldbe (9.3+2.99andmultiply;1.1) or 13.52 TPY. Since the variance limits theseemissions to 12.8 tons, the variance limits are, in fact, less than theSIP incorporated demonstration of attainment limit. <T3>USEPA's Response.</T3> Wisconsin's comment that the variance emissionlimit, 12.8 tons of VOC per year from the dip tank and reducer solventemissions, is below the SIP's projected with-growth emission rate, 13.52tons of VOC per year, is misleading. Wisconsin has been using the assumed10 percent source growth to accommodate other new source growth. If theassumed growth is allocated to Gehl Company, then double growth (Gehl Companyand unspecified new sources) may be allowed. <T3>Comment 2.</T3> The FY 1986 RFP report which Wisconsin submitted toUSEPA on December 23, 1987, showed that Wisconsin is ahead of the schedulepredicted in the 1982 plan in reducing ozone precursor emissions. <T3>USEPA's Response.</T3> Although Wisconsin is technically ``ahead''of the projected emission reduction on the RFP curve, monitored 1987 and1988 ozone concentrations indicate that adequate progress towards ozoneattainment is not being made. USEPA has issued a post-1987 SIP call. OnMay 26, 1988, Valdas V. Adamkus of the USEPA notified Governor Tommy G.Thompson that the Wisconsin SIP is substantially inadequate to achievethe NAAQS for ozone in Kenosha County, Kewaunee County, Manitowoc County,Ozaukee County, Racine County, Sheboygan County, Walworth County, WashingtonCounty, and Waukesha County. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> WDNR fails to see how USEPA can conclude that excessVOC emissions of 4.32 TPY might jeopardize attainment or maintenance ofthe ozone standard. <T3>USEPA's Response.</T3> In light of 1987 and 1988 monitored ozone concentrationsin this area, USEPA will not accept any de minimis impact arguments, particularlywhen new source growth and other SIP variances have been allowed underWisconsin's SIP. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> Sources of this size are not even required to applyRACT controls in many areas of the Nation. <T3>USEPA's Response.</T3> Wisconsin chose to require RACT for sourcesof this size in Washington County as one element in its demonstration ofattainment of the ozone standard in Southeastern Wisconsin. <T3>Comment 5.</T3> The Gehl Company is located in West Bend. For thisfacility to influence the Slinger, Horicon and Fond du Lac monitors, thewinds must be from 50 degrees northeast, 95 degrees east, and 150 degreessoutheast, respectively. A summary of the ozone data measured at thesethree stations and concurrent wind observations show that only the Fonddu Lac monitor would appear to be potentially influenced by VOC emissionsfrom the Gehl Company. <T3>USEPA's Response.</T3> The State of Wisconsin is incorrectly concentratingon impacts at the Slinger, Horicon and Fond du Lac monitoring sites, whileignoring other monitoring sites, as well as other nonmonitored locations.As noted in Wisconsin's 1982 ozone SIP submission, Gehl Company and otherWashington County emissions (as well as those from the rest of the Milwaukeedemonstration area) can affect air quality in areas with currently monitoredozone standard violations, such as Ozaukee County. The State's conclusionsin its comments would not be the same if the air quality from Ozaukee,Milwaukee, Manitowoc, Sheboygan, Kewaunee and other downwind Counties wereconsidered. USEPA is disapproving this SIP revision because the State has not demonstratedthat the VOC emissions from Gehl will not jeopardize attainment or maintenanceof the ozone standard in Washington County or other nonattainment areasin Wisconsin. <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous </ITAG>Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607, petitions for judicialreview of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appealsfor the appropriate circuit by September 11, 1989. This action may notbe challenged later in the proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See307(b)(2).)
