It was the second Soviet space mishap revealed this week.   ``Only a miracle can save it now,'' Roald Z. Sagdeyev, head ofthe Soviet Space Research Institute, said in an interview with TheAssociated Press.   Ground-control operators are unable to communicate with thePhobos 1 probe, now millions of miles from Earth.   This week, a Soyuz TM-5 capsule carrying two cosmonauts cameclose to being marooned in space because of equipment problems andmistakes by the ship's commander delayed its return to Earth.   Sagdeyev said scientists would now have to rely on a sistership, Phobos 2, that is also racing toward the Red Planet. Phobos 1was launched July 7 and Phobos 2 five days later in missions thatcost $480 million.   The probes were scheduled to go into orbit around Mars and inJanuary drop behind Phobos, the larger of the planet's two moons,to study the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field.   Phobos 1 was to drop a lander that would stay in one place onthe surface of the moon for a year. Phobos 2 was to deploy a landerthat would hop around on the moon in 20-yard leaps, gathering andanalyzing soil samples.   Phobos 1 is still moving in space, but it may not be on itsplanned trajectory because the orientation and guidance systemsaren't functioning. It was not immediately known how the originalplan would be modified now that one of the probes is useless.   Sagdeyev said a ground control operator at the Soviet MissionControl Center near Moscow sent an incorrect command to Phobos 1during the night of Aug. 29-30 and that a computer failed to detectthe error and flash the signal, ``bad command.'' He did not saywhether the faulty computer was on the ground or on board thespacecraft.   ``The command signified the slow suicide of the machinery,Phobos 1,'' said Sagdeyev. ``It lost orientation, and the solarpanels stopped looking at the sun. In two to three days acooling-down of the craft occurred.''   ``The machinery has simply frozen. It fell into a deep,lethargic sleep,'' the scientist said.   The mistake was only discovered three days later. Sagdeyev saidinvestigators also determined that no second operator was on dutyto check the work of the controller who made the mistake, violatingthe control center's rules. He did not say if either controller waspunished.   Sagdeyev, the most prominent Soviet space scientist and a majorsupporter of the exploration of Mars, said ground controllers werestill sending signals to Phobos 1 to restore orientation, but werehaving no luck. He suggested they now turn their attention toPhobos 2 and ``do everything to prevent a repetition of the mistakewith the second machine.''   The space research chief spoke to a reporter during a receptionat the U.S. ambassador's residence in honor of Andrei D. Sakharov,the Soviet physicist and human rights activist who is the 1975Nobel Peace Prize laureate.   On Tuesday, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov and his Afghancrewmate, Ahad Abdul Mohmand, had to postpone landing of theirSoyuz TM-5 capsule because a sensor used to orient the craft and acomputer malfunctioned.   In addition to the equipment problems, Lyakhov said later heacted improperly during one landing attempt and made the problemsworse. The two, who were running low on air and food, returned toEarth safely Wednesday.   NASA, the American National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, was to have helped the Soviets track Phobos 1 nextmonth, but NASA official Raymond J. Amorose said Thursday theSoviets reported they lost contact with the craft.   NASA was also supposed to have worked with Phobos 1 in a jointU.S.-Soviet study of the sun.   The Tass news agency indicated that scientists were in normalcontact with Phobos 2 and said it was 11.8 million miles from Earth.   After a 111 million-mile trip, both craft were to have falleninto orbit behind Phobos for a three-month remote study meant tohelp unlock mysteries of Mars, which some scientists believe mayonce have hosted life. In April, the craft were to drop out oftheir orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moon's surface,where they were to release two small landers.   It is the most ambitious of about 18 Soviet and U.S. unmannedmissions to study Mars, which, next to Venus, is believed to bemost like Earth.</TEXT></DOC>
