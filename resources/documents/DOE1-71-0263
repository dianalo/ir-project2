Recently,however, there has been renewed interest in systems which are heat waterdirectly. In order to evaluate a prototype direct water heating systemAmerican Sunsystems constructed two systems side-by-side in the SciencePark, New Haven, Connecticut, and evaluated their performance over asingle winter season. The solar water tanks in each case were connectedto an automatic draw which drew and discarded water at specified timesduring the day to simulate DHW usage. Various data points were monitoredfor temperature on a continuous basis through a strip chart recorder,and overall energy delivered was recorded by means of BTU meters bothon the solar loop and on the tank output. This paper presents selectedresults from that study and compares these experimental results witha theoretical analysis developed by the author. A comparison with Fchartanalysis and with &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; is also included.</TEXT></DOC>
