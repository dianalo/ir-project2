New Source Performance Standards_GeneralNew source performance standards (NSPS, or standards) implement section111 of the CAA. The NSPS are issued for categories of sources which cause,or contribute significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipatedto endanger public health or welfare. They apply to new stationary sourcesof emissions (i.e., sources whose construction, reconstruction, or modificationbegins after a standard for them is proposed). An NSPS requires these sourcesto control emissions to the level achievable by the best system of continuousemission reduction, considering costs and other impacts.B. NSPS Decision SchemeAn NSPS is the product of a series of decisions related to certain keyelements for the source category being considered for regulation. The elementsidentified in this ``decision scheme'' are generally the following:1. Source category to be regulated_usually an entire industry but can bea process or group of processes within an industry.2. Pollutant(s) to be regulated_the particular substance(s) emitted bythe source that the standards will control.3. Best system of continuous emission reduction_the technology on whichthe standards will be based, i.e.,<ITAG tagnum="20">application of the best system of continuous emission reduction which(taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction,and any nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements)the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated. (Section111(a)(1))</ITAG>4. Affected facility_the pieces or groups of equipment that comprise thesources to which the standards will apply.5. Emission points to be regulated_within the affected facility, the specificphysical location emitting pollutants (e.g., vents, stacks, and equipmentleaks).6. Format for the standards_the form in which the standards are expressed,i.e., as a percent reduction in emissions, as pollutant concentrations(emission limits), as fuel specifications, or as equipment standards.7. Actual standards_based on what the best demonstrated technology (BDT)can achieve, the maximum permissible emissions.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> In general, standards do not require that a specific technologybe used to achieve them. The source owner/operator may select the methodfor achieving the pollution control required.</ITAG>8. Other possible considerations_in addition, NSPS often include: standardsfor visible emissions, modification/reconstruction considerations, monitoringrequirements, performance test methods, and reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.C. Overview of This PreambleThis preamble will:1. Summarize the important features of this NSPS by discussing the conclusionsreached with respect to each of the elements in the decision scheme.2. Present a rationale for each of the decisions in the decision scheme.3. Describe the environmental, energy, and economic impacts of this NSPS.4. Discuss administrative requirements relevant to this action.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of the Standards</ITAG>A. Source Category To Be RegulatedThe proposed standards would apply to industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating units with heat input capacities of 29 MW (100 millionBtu/hour) or less but greater than or equal to 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour).Industrial-commercial-institutional steam generating units include anydevices, regardless of application, that combust fuel to produce steamor to heat water or any other heat transfer medium, including units thatare part of a cogeneration system or combined cycle system.B. Pollutants To Be RegulatedEmissions of SO<T2>2</T2>, PM, and NO<T2>x</T2> would be regulated under the proposed standards.C. Best Demonstrated TechnologyThe determination of BDT reflects EPA's consideration of a wide varietyof factors. These factors include the feasibility and availability of technologies,the costs of control, and energy and environmental effects.The proposed standards for SO<T2>2</T2> are based on a percent reduction requirement for coal-firedunits greater than 22 MW (75 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity whichoperate at annual capacity factors above 55 percent (0.55) and the useof low sulfur coal for all other coal-fired units in this source category.The proposed standards for SO<T2>2</T2> are also based on the use of very low sulfur oil capable ofmeeting an emission limit of 215 ng/J (0.50 lb/million Btu) for oil-firedunits. The EPA is proposing to conclude that these emission limits andpercent reduction requirements represent the BDT's for reducing emissionof SO<T2>2</T2> from small coal- and oil-fired steam generating units.The proposed standards for PM are based on the use of: fabric filters orelectrostatic precipitators (ESP's) for reducing PM emissions from smallcoal-fired units of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity orgreater; wet scrubbers and ESP's for reducing PM emissions from small wood-firedunits of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity or greater; andvery low sulfur oil capable of meeting an SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit of 215 ng/J (0.50 lb/million Btu) heat inputfor reducing PM emissions from small oil-fired units. The EPA is proposingto conclude that these emission limits represent BDT's for reducing PMemissions from small coal-, wood-, and oil-fired steam generating units.D. Format of the StandardsThe proposed standards for SO<T2>2</T2> establish a percent reduction requirement for certain coal-firedunits and an emission limit for coal- and oil-fired units. Emissions wouldbe calculated as nanograms of pollutant per joule (ng/J) of heat inputor pounds of pollutant per million Btu (lb/million Btu) heat input suppliedby the fuel. As an alternative to meeting the SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit for oil, a fuel sulfur content specificationis proposed. The proposed standards for PM and NO<T2>X</T2> establish emission limits, which are also calculated on a ng/Jor lb/million Btu heat input basis. The proposed standards for PM alsoinclude a percent opacity limit.E. Actual Standards<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Particulate Matter</ITAG>The proposed standards for PM would establish an emission limit of 22 ng/J(0.05 lb/million Btu) heat input for coal-fired units with a heat inputcapacity of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) or greater. An emission limitof 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input would be established underthe proposed standards for wood-fired units with a heat input capacityof 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) or greater. All coal-, oil-, and wood-firedunits of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity or greater wouldbe subject to an opacity limit of 20 percent (0.2).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Sulfur Dioxide</ITAG>The proposed standards for SO<T2>2</T2> would require all small coal-fired industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating units greater than 22 MW (75 million Btu/hour) heat inputcapacity that operate at an annual capacity factor for coal of greaterthan 55 percent (0.55) to meet a 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> emission reduction requirement and an SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit of 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/million Btu) heat input.All other coal-fired units in this source category would be required tomeet only an SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit of 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/million Btu) heat input.Small oil-fired steam generating units would be required to meet an SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit of 215 ng/J (0.50 lb/million Btu) heat input.Alternatively, small oil-fired steam generating units could comply withthe SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit by firing oil with a sulfur content of less than0.5 weight percent.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Nitrogen Oxides</ITAG>The proposed standards for NO<T2>X</T2> would establish an emission limit of 430 ng/J (1.0 lb/millionBtu) heat input of all small coal-, oil-, and natural gas-fired industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating units with a heat input capacity of 2.9 MW (10 millionBtu/hour) or greater.F. Performance Testing and Monitoring RequirementsThe proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards for small coal-fired steam generating units wouldrequire either use of a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS), ReferenceMethod 6B, or daily fuel sampling for sulfur content. Compliance with thestandards would be determined on a continuous 30-day rolling average basisusing the CEMS, Method 6B, or daily fuel sampling and analysis resultsto calculate SO<T2>2</T2> emission for 30 consecutive steam generating unit operatingdays. Calculations to determine compliance would be made in accordancewith Reference Method 19. For units subject to the percent reduction requirement,SO<T2>2</T2> emissions at the outlet of the control device must be measuredby a CEMS or Method 6B.Compliance with the SO<T2>2</T2> standard for residual oil-fired units would be determined byuse of a CEMS, Method 6B, or by fuel sampling and analysis. Compliancewith the SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit would be determined on a continuous 30-day rollingaverage basis. Calculations to determine compliance would be made in accordancewith Reference Method 19.As mentioned, a residual oil-fired unit may demonstrate compliance throughthe use of fuel sampling and analysis. One method of fuel sampling wouldbe to take daily as-fired fuel samples at the inlet of the steam generatingunit and have them analyzed. However, the owner or operator of a residualoil-fired steam generating unit may also take and analyze a sample fromthe oil storage tank for each steam generating unit subject to the standardafter each new shipment of oil is received and before any amount of oilis combusted. Results of the fuel analysis would be used as the daily valuewhen computing 30-day rolling averages of SO<T2>2</T2> emissions until the next fuel shipment is received. Upon receiptof a new shipment, a new sample from the oil supply tank would be takenand analyzed, and then used as the new daily average. It is assumed thatthe oil in the tank is thoroughly mixed during filling; therefore, a sampletaken from the tank after filling would accurately represent the sulfurcontent of the oil in the tank.Performance tests to determine compliance with the PM emission limits wouldbe conducted in accordance with Reference Method 5, Reference Method 5B,or Reference Method 17. Reference Method 3 would be used for gas analysisand Reference Method 1 for the selection of sampling points. ReferenceMethod 9 (a 6-minute average of 24 observations) would be used to determinecompliance with the opacity standard. Continuous opacity monitoring wouldbe required for all small coal-, oil-, and wood-fired steam generatingunits with heat input capacities of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) or greater.G. Reporting and RecordkeepingThe proposed standards would require owners or operators of all affectedfacilities to submit a notification of the intent to initiate operationof a new, modified, or reconstructed small steam generating unit. In addition,a report of the results of an initial performance and opacity test wouldbe required for coal-, oil-, and wood-fired units to demonstrate initialcompliance with the SO<T2>2</T2>, PM, and opacity standards, as applicable.Quarterly reports of the fuel sampling and analysis, Method 6B, or CEMSresults would be required for coal- and residual oil-fired units underthe proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards. Records of all data, including the results of emissiontests, fuel sampling and analysis results, Method 6B data, and CEMS datamust be maintained for 2 years and made available for inspection by enforcementpersonnel.The proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards would require owners or operators of distillate oil-firedunits to submit a quarterly report of fuels fired from these units. Thereport must include a certified statement signed by the owner of the unitthat all oil combusted in the unit since the previous report complied withthe American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) specifications fordistillate oil. Owners or operators must maintain shipping receipts for2 years to show that they have purchased distillate oil meeting ASTM specifications.The proposed PM standards would require owners or operators to submit quarterlyexcess emission reports for coal-, oil-, and wood-fired units. If no excessemissions occur in a particular quarter, then a semiannual report wouldbe required stating that no excess emissions occurred during the reportingperiod.H. Request for CommentsThe Administrator will welcome comments on all aspects of the proposedstandards, including economic and technological issues, proposed test methods,and monitoring requirements. All comments received will be considered inthe development and selection of final standards. However, EPA specificallyrequests comment on three issues raised during development of the proposedstandards which warrant special consideration and are discussed below.Each issue involves a determination of the best system of continuous emissionreduction taking into account the cost of achieving such emission reductionand the ``reasonableness'' of the proposed standards in terms of cost effectiveness(the cost to a small steam generating unit of complying with the proposedregulation divided by the emission reduction). Specific comment is requestedfrom all interested parties including State agencies, Federal agencies,environmental groups, industry trade associations, and individual citizens.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Percent Reduction Requirement</ITAG>As stated previously, the proposed standards limiting SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small coal-fired steam generating units wouldrequire a 90 percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from units with heat input capacities greater than22 MW (75 million Btu/hour) that operate at annual capacity factors greaterthan 55 percent. The resulting cost effectiveness ranges from $3,100/Mgto $3,600/Mg ($2,800/ton to $3,300/ton) for individual steam generatingunits. These cost-effectiveness values are on the high end of the costeffectiveness range imposed by past NSPS for SO<T2>2</T2> control (i.e., up to $3,000/ton). Therefore, the Administratorspecifically requests comment on this portion of the proposed standards.In this case, the only alternative would be to eliminate the percent reductionrequirement from the standards and establish an emission limit of 520 ng/J(1.2 lb/million Btu) heat input. Past NSPS for steam generating units haveprovided relief from percent reduction requirements where the impacts ofrequiring percent reduction were considered unreasonable. The cost effectivenessof this alternative would range from $600/Mg to $2,100/Mg ($500/ton to$1,900/ton) for individual units.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Coal PM Standard</ITAG>As stated earlier, the proposed standards limiting PM emissions from smallsteam generating units would establish an emission limit of 22 ng/J (0.05lb/million Btu) heat input for coal-fired units with heat input capacitiesof 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) or greater. The resulting cost effectivenessranges from about $2,800/Mg to $7,200/Mg ($2,500/ton to $6,600/ton) forindividual units. As stated below under ``Selection of Best System of ParticulateMatter Emission Reduction'', these cost effectiveness values are high comparedto the cost effectiveness imposed by past NSPS for PM control (i.e., upto $3,000/ton). However, the affected facilities will be predominantlylocated in urban areas, and the particulate matter emissions will be mostlyPM<T2>10</T2>, have toxic characteristics, and be released through shortstacks. Fabric filters/ESP's are clearly demonstrated technologies thatprovide the best emission reduction potential of any PM control device,and the economic impact of their use is negligible. As with the percentreduction requirement, the Administrator specifically requests commenton the proposed conclusion that fabric filters/ESP's represent best demonstratedtechnology for small coal-fired steam generating units.Three regulatory alternatives were examined during development of the proposedstandards. There are an infinite number of alternatives that could havebeen examined, which could have included combinations of various controltechnologies with different size cutoffs and capacity factor cutoffs. Forexample, one alternative could have been an emission limit of 22 ng/J (0.05lb/million Btu) heat input for coal-fired units with heat input capacitiesof 15 MW (50 million Btu/hour) or greater which operate at annual capacityfactors of 55 percent or more, and an emission limit of 130 ng/J (0.30lb/million Btu) heat input for coal-fired units with heat input capacitiesof 15 MW (50 million Btu/hour) or greater which operate at annual capacityfactors below 55 percent. The resulting cost effectiveness of this alternativewould range from $1,800/Mg to $3,600/Mg ($1,600/ton to $3,200/ton) forindividual units. This alternative results in cost effectiveness valuescloser to those imposed by past NSPS for PM control, but would permit theuse of less effective control technologies (double mechanical collectors)on certain units.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Wood PM Standard</ITAG>As stated earlier, the proposed standards limiting PM emissions from smallsteam generating units would establish an emission limit of 43 ng/J (0.1lb/million Btu) heat input for wood-fired units with heat input capacitiesof 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) or greater. The resulting cost effectivenessranges from about $6,000/Mg to $18,000/Mg ($5,400/ton to $16,000/ton) forindividual units. As stated below under ``Selection of Best System of ParticulateMatter Emission Reduction'', these cost effectiveness values are high comparedto the cost effectiveness imposed by past NSPS for PM control (i.e., upto $3,000/ton). As with the percent reduction requirement and the coalPM standard, the Administrator specifically requests comment on the proposedconclusion that wet scrubbers/ESP's represent best demonstrated technologyfor small wood-fired steam generating units.Three regulatory alternatives were examined during development of the proposedstandards. As with coal, there are an infinite number of alternatives thatcould have been examined, which could have included combinations of variouscontrol technologies with different size cutoffs and capacity factor cutoffs.For example, one alternative could have been an emission limit of 130 ng/J(0.30 lb/million Btu) heat input for all wood-fired units with heat inputcapacities of 15 MW (50 million Btu/hour) or greater. The resulting costeffectiveness of this alternative would range from $900/Mg to $2,900/Mg($800/ton to $2,600/ton) for individual units. This alternative resultsin cost effectiveness values closer to those imposed by past NSPS for PMcontrol, but would be based on the use of double mechanical collectors(a less effective control technology) for small wood-fired units.<ITAG tagnum="81">III. Impacts of the Standards</ITAG>A. AirCompared to SO<T2>2</T2> emission levels as currently controlled by a typical State ImplementationPlan (SIP), the proposed standards would reduce emissions of SO<T2>2</T2> from a small industrial-commercial-institutional steam generatingunit by about 70 to 80 percent, depending on the steam generating unitsize and the type of fuel fired.The proposed standards would reduce emissions of PM from a small industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating unit by about 80 to 90 percent, depending on the steamgenerating unit size and the type of fuel fired.In the fifth year after this NSPS becomes applicable, nationwide emissionsof SO<T2>2</T2> would be decreased by about 34,000 megagrams per year (Mg/year)or about 37,000 tons per year (tons/year) compared with projected emissionlevels under the regulatory baseline. Nationwide emissions of PM wouldbe decreased by about 3,100 Mg/year (3,400 tons/year) compared with projectedemission levels under the regulatory baseline.B. Water and Solid WasteUnder the proposed standards, no significant water pollution impacts areprojected, and the projected impacts on solid waste generation are small.In addition, the wastes produced by PM control processes are nonhazardousand can be disposed of using traditional treatment and disposal techniques.Therefore, no adverse water pollution or solid waste impacts are anticipatedas a result of the proposed standards.C. EnergyThe proposed standards will not result in significant impacts on nationalfuel use markets. Some fuel switching from coal and residual oil to naturalgas or distillate oil may occur, but the impact of any fuel switching oncoal, oil, and natural gas markets would be negligible on a national basis.Energy consumption impacts resulting from the proposed standards wouldbe small.D. Control Costs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Typical Steam Generating Unit Costs</ITAG>Under the proposed standards, the capital cost of a small coal-fired steamgenerating unit would increase by about 11 percent over the costs at theregulatory baseline. The magnitude of the increase would depend on steamgenerating unit size and type. Annualized costs for a small coal-firedsteam generating unit would increase by approximately 6 percent over thecosts at the regulatory baseline, depending on unit size and coal type.For a small oil-fired steam generating unit, the capital cost would increaseby about 3 percent and annualized costs would increase by about 19 percentover the costs at the regulatory baseline, depending on unit size and oiltype. For a small wood-fired steam generating unit, the capital cost wouldincrease by about 19 percent and annualized costs would increase by about10 percent over the costs at the regulatory baseline, depending on unitsize and type. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Nationwide Costs</ITAG>In the fifth year of applicability of the proposed standards, the nationwideannualized costs for small steam generating units would increase by about$38 million.E. Economic EffectsThe economic effects of the proposed standards are considered negligible.For most of the six major industry groups analyzed, product prices underthe ``worse case'' would increase by less than 1 percent. For the moststeam intensive industries, product prices under the ``worst case'' areprojected to increase by 2.8 percent. National product price impacts wouldbe significantly less. Most commercial-institutional facilities would notbe affected by the proposed standards because of the size of the steamgenerating unit and fuels fired at these facilities. Of the commercial-institutionalfacilities with steam generating units subject to the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> and PM standards, costs of services would generally increaseby less than 0.5 percent. For the most steam intensive commercial facility,costs of services are projected to increase by 1.3 percent. Rental ratesfor office buildings that are affected by the proposed standards wouldincrease by less than 1 percent.<ITAG tagnum="81">IV. Rationale for the Standards</ITAG>A. Selection of Source CategoryOn August 21, 1979, a priority list for development of additional NSPSwas published in accordance with sections 111(b)(1)(A) and 111(f)(1) ofthe CAA (44 FR 49222). This list identified 59 major stationary sourcecategories that were judged to contribute significantly to air pollutionthat could reasonably be expected to endanger public health or welfare.Fossil fuel-fired steam generating units ranked eleventh on this prioritylist of sources for which NSPS would be established in the future.Of the 10 sources ranked above fossil fuel-fired steam generating unitson the priority list, 9 were major sources of volatile organic compound(VOC) emissions. Because many areas have not attained the national ambientair quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone, major sources of VOC emissionswere accorded a very high priority. Fossil fuel-fired industrial steamgenerating units were the highest ranked source of PM and SO<T2>2</T2> emissions when the priority list was published.An amendment to the priority list was promulgated on November 25, 1986,that expanded the source category of industrial fossil fuel-fired steamgenerating units to cover all steam generating units, including both fossilfuel-fired and nonfossil fuel-fired steam generating units, as well assteam generating units used in commercial and institutional applications(51 FR 42796). Consistent with that amendment to the priority list, theseproposed standards include both fossil fuel- and wood-fired small industrial,commercial, and institutional steam generating units.Fossil fuel- and wood-fired steam generating units are significant sourcesof emissions of PM (including PM<T2>10</T2>, which is PM with mean diameters smaller than 10 microns),SO<T2>2</T2>, and NO<T2>X</T2>. In particular, the expected construction of numerous new smallsteam generating units as a result of industrial, commercial, and institutionalsector growth is expected to result in an increase in emissions of thesepollutants.National ambient air quality standards have been established for SO<T2>2</T2>, PM<T2>10</T2>, and NO<T2>X</T2> because of their known adverse effects on public health andwelfare. Impacts of these pollutants have been documented in criteria documentsprepared under Section 108 of the CAA. These effects are a major basisfor concluding that emissions from small steam generating units constitutea potential danger to public health and welfare. Also significant is thefact that many new small steam generating units will be located in urbanareas where a large population may be exposed to the emissions. B. Selection of Affected FacilitiesThis rulemaking focused on industrial-commercial-institutional steam generatingunits with heat input capacities of 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour) or less.Steam generating units are defined as devices, regardless of application,that combust fuel to produce steam or to heat water or any other heat transfermedium. This definition includes units that are part of a cogenerationor a combined cycle system, but does not include process heaters. A processheater is defined as a device that is primarily used to heat a materialto promote a chemical reaction in which the material participates as areactant or catalyst.The population of steam generating units in the size range of 29 MW (100million Btu/hour) heat input or less can be subdivided into two distinctsegments: commercial-institutional and industrial units. Commercial-institutionalunits include those units located at offices and apartments, shopping centers,hospitals, laundries, hotels, elementary and secondary schools, collegesand universities, and other nonindustrial facilities. Commercial-institutionalunits are predominantly found in the size range below about 8.7 MW (30million Btu/hour) heat input capacity. Industrial units include those unitsthat provide steam for manufacturing and other production facilities. Industrialunits are predominantly found in the size range above 8.7 MW (30 millionBtu/hour) heat input capacity.The commercial-institutional segment can be further subdivided into twoprincipal groups. Above about 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity,most commercial-institutional units serve major hospitals, large collegesand universities, large hotels, large commercial laundries, and other largecommercial-institutional facilities. Below about 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour)heat input capacity, the majority of commercial-institutional units serveelementary and secondary schools, shopping centers, office buildings, andother smaller commercial-institutional facilities.Consequently, the small industrial-commercial-institutional steam generatingunit population is composed of units falling into one of three major sizeranges. Units between 8.7 and 29 MW (30 and 100 million Btu/hour) heatinput capacity are used primarily in industrial facilities. Units between2.9 and 8.7 MW (10 and 30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity are usedprimarily at larger commercial-institutional facilities and some industrialfacilities. Units below 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input capacityare used almost exclusively at smaller commercial-institutional facilities.In addition to differences in end use application, the predominant typeof steam generating unit varies according to these three major size ranges.In the industrial segment [above about 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heatinput capacity], watertube units predominate. In the population segmentof larger commercial-institutional units [between about 8.7 MW (30 millionBtu/hour) and 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity], both watertubeand firetube units are found. In the small commercial-institutional populationsegment [below about 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity],firetube and cast-iron designs predominate. Each of these unit types hasnoticeably different design and emission characteristics.Fuel use patterns also vary according to the three major size ranges inthe small steam generating unit population. Natural gas and distillateoil tend to be the predominant fuels combusted in commercial-institutionalunits below 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input, whereas residual oilis an important fuel in industrial and larger commercial-institutionalunits. Also, to the extent that coal is used as a fuel in the small steamgenerating unit population, it is generally used in industrial units above8.7 MWS (30 million Btu/hour) in size.Because of the different applications, types of units, and fuels firedin the three major size ranges of the small steam generating unit population,the potential emissions reductions for each size range will vary. The majorpollutants emitted from steam generating units are SO<T2>2</T2>, PM, and NO<T2>x</T2>. The actual amount of these pollutants emitted from each individualunit will vary according to size range. For instance, potential SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions from a typical steam generating unit smallerthan 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity would be negligible;potential SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions from a typical unit between 2.9 and 8.7MW (10 and 30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity would be about 70 Mg/year(80 tons/year); and potential SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions from a typical unit between 8.7 and 29 MW(30 and 100 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity would be about 450 Mg/year(500 tons/year).As with SO<T2>2</T2>, emissions of PM from this source category also vary by sizerange. For example, potential PM emission reductions from a typical steamgenerating unit smaller than 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input capacitywould be negligible. Potential PM emission reductions from a typical unitbetween 2.9 and 8.7 MW (10 and 30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacitywould be about 2.7 Mg/year (3.0 tons/year). Potential PM emissions reductionsfrom a typical unit above 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacitywould be approximately 90 Mg/year (100 tons/year). The same pattern isevident with emissions of NO<T2>x</T2>.The preceding discussion generalizes the fuel use, unit type, and emissioncharacteristics of small steam generating units. Other size ranges couldhave been selected and may, in some cases, be appropriate. The EPA solicitscomments on whether the size ranges chosen will accurately represent thesmall steam generating units subject to the NSPS.This comparison demonstrates that the greatest potential emission reductionsare achievable from units in the largest size ranges (i.e., industrialand large commercial-institutional units) and that the potential emissionreductions achievable from units in the smallest size range (i.e., smallcommercial-institutional units) are extremely small. Considerable administrativeand enforcement resources, however, would be needed to apply standardsto these small steam generating units because of the large number of unitsin the smallest size range. For example, an estimated 14,000 new unitsbelow 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) in size are projected to be built throughthe fifth year after proposal, compared to about 1,300 units in the sizerange between 2.9 and 8.7 MW (10 and 30 million Btu/hour) in size, andabout 500 units between 8.7 and 29 MW (30 and 100 million Btu/hour) insize.Thus, even though a larger number of units is found in the smallest sizerange, a much greater emission reduction per unit would be gained by focusingthe NSPS on industrial and large commercial-institutional units. Very littleemission reduction would be gained by regulating a steam generating unitin the smallest size range, and substantial agency resources would be neededto review, monitor, and enforce the NSPS.In addition to the extra burden on regulatory agencies, owners or operatorsof these smaller sized units would have the extra burden of dealing withthese new national regulations. As stated previously, most of the smallercommercial-institutional units [i.e., those with heat input capacitiesless than 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour)] are located in places such as publicschools or churches. Because these facilities usually employ part-timeor volunteer operators rather than full-time personnel, the testing andreporting requirements needed to demonstrate compliance with the standardswould be much more difficult for small commercial-institutional establishmentsto meet. For example, it would be difficult and burdensome for personnelat an elementary school, church, or small apartment building to collectand analyze samples of fuels fired and submit reports on a regular basisto the respective enforcement agency.Because of the extra burden required of both the unit owner/operator andregulatory agency personnel, and the small emission reductions involved,regulation of units in the smallest size range is not considered reasonable.Consequently, a lower size cutoff of 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heatinput capacity was selected for determining applicability with the proposedregulations.C. Selection of Best System of Nitrogen Oxides Emission ReductionBecause of the relatively small emission reductions and the relativelyhigh costs associated with NO<T2>x</T2> controls on small steam generating units, NO<T2>x</T2> standards for small steam generating units are considered unreasonable.For example, a recent report by the South Coast Air Quality ManagementDistrict regarding NO<T2>x</T2> standards for small steam generating units located in southernCalifornia cited cost-effectiveness levels of $6,600/Mg ($6,000/ton). Thesecost-effectiveness levels are generally considered unreasonable for nationalNO<T2>x</T2> standards. Consequently, to evaluate the reasonableness of NO<T2>x</T2> standards for small steam generating units, a screening-typecost analysis was undertaken to estimate the cost effectiveness of NO<T2>x</T2> control technologies available for setting national standardslimiting NO<T2>x</T2> emissions from small steam generating units. Several control technologies are available to control NO<T2>x</T2> emissions from small steam generating units: low excess air(LEA), flue gas recirculation (FGR), staged combustion (SC), thermal de-NO<T2>x</T2>, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). With LEA, the combustionair flow is reduced to near the minimum amount needed for complete combustion.In an FGR system, a portion of the flue gas is recycled from the stackto the burner windbox. Upon entering the windbox, the flue gas is mixedwith the combustion air prior to being fed to the burner or the grate.In one type of SC system, conventional burners are used to introduce thefuel and a portion of the combustion air (called primary air) into thesteam generating unit. The remaining combustion air (secondary air) isintroduced approximately one-third of the distance down the furnace throughoverfire air (OFA) ports. Alternatively, SC can be carried out in the burnerrather than through the use of OFA ports. In thermal de-NO<T2>x</T2>, ammonia (NH<T2>3</T2>) is injected into the upper combustion chamber (convection section)of the combustor at a specified temperature window to reduce NO<T2>x</T2> to nitrogen gas (N<T2>2</T2>). In SCR, NH<T2>3</T2> injected into the flue gas downstream of the combustion chambermixes with the NO<T2>x</T2> contained in the flue gas and passes through a catalyst bed.Of these control technologies, thermal de-NO<T2>x</T2> was not considered further because the required temperature/residencetime window generally cannot be achieved by units in the small steam generatingunit size range. Selective catalytic reduction also was not consideredfurther because the catalysts used in this technique are very expensive.Low excess air, SC, and FGR are applicable to small steam generating unitsand could serve as the basis for national standards limiting NO<T2>x</T2> emissions from such units. Low excess air has the potentialfor reducing NO<T2>x</T2> emissions by about 20 percent, and FGR and SC have the potentialfor reducing emissions by about 50 percent.The current data available on NO<T2>x</T2> emissions from these three control techniques applied to smallsteam generating units are quite limited and very scattered. Conclusionsregarding performance of these technologies cannot be drawn, and therefore,standards cannot be developed based on the existing data. Nevertheless,assumptions were made regarding the performance capabilities and costsof these technologies to determine whether the cost impacts of establishingNO<T2>x</T2> standards for small steam generating units would be reasonable.For the three NO<T2>x</T2> control technologies examined, the costs for NO<T2>x</T2> control were estimated for small steam generating units combustingnatural gas, distillate oil, residual oil, and coal. For a typical 15 MW(50 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity unit operating at a capacityfactor of 55 percent (0.55), costs were calculated for uncontrolled unitsand units equipped with LEA, FGR, and SC. Approximations of baseline andcontrolled NO<T2>x</T2> emission levels were used to estimate the cost effectivenessof applying LEA, FGR, or SC controls to these units.The resulting cost-effectiveness levels for LEA ranged from $3,300/Mg ($3,000/ton)to $33,000/Mg ($30,000/ton), and the resulting cost-effectiveness levelsfor FGR and SC were in excess of $3,300/Mg ($3,000/ton). For this analysisof FGR and SC, NO<T2>x</T2> emission reductions were assumed to be 70 percent over baseline,which is in the same range cited in the above-mentioned California report.These emission reduction projections, which are quite high, tend to overstatethe actual achievable reductions so that the true cost-effectiveness valuesfor FGR/SC on small steam generating units are expected to be higher.Some costs were not included in these analyses, such as the cost of employinga full-time, highly trained steam generating unit operator, who may notbe present at all facilities. Due to the sophistication of the technologies,the operation of NO<T2>x</T2> controls requires full-time, skilled operators. Since no costfor the operator was included, the actual cost effectiveness of NO<T2>x</T2> control on small steam generating units could be higher, andthe performance capabilities of the technologies as well as the achievableemission reductions could be overestimated.As mentioned earlier, there are some areas of the country that have acuteair quality problems. In these areas, NO<T2>x</T2> controls may well be considered necessary and reasonable evenat higher cost-effectiveness levels. However, the estimated cost-effectivenesslevels associated with NO<T2>x</T2> standards for small steam generating units, discussed above,are considered unreasonable for national NO<T2>x</T2> standards.However, EPA is under Court order to issue ``* * * proposed small boilerNSPS for particulate matter, nitrous oxides, and sulfur dioxide by June1, 1989 * * *'' (<T3>Sierra Club vs Reilly</T3>, D.D.C. N. 84-0325). While the Court's decisionrecognized EPA's discretion in determining which pollutants from a sourcecategory to regulate, the specific language of the Order could be interpretedto mean that EPA <T3>must</T3> propose NO<T2>x</T2> standards. As stated above, EPA considers national NO<T2>x</T2> standards based upon readily available combustion modificationtechniques or add-on control technologies to be unreasonable for smallsteam generating units. However, to avoid the possibility that EPA wouldbe in violation of the letter of the Court order, a NO<T2>x</T2> standard of 430 ng/J (1.0 lb/million Btu) heat input is proposedin today's notice for affected facilities combusting coal, oil, naturalgas, or mixtures of these fuels with any other fuels. The NO<T2>x</T2> standard would be established at a level that can be met byall small steam generating units. For this reason, no source testing ormonitoring would be required. The EPA will consider comments on the appropriatenessof this standard for NO<T2>x</T2> and specifically solicits comment on the appropriateness ofapplying the NO<T2>x</T2> control techniques described above to this source category.As with the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards and PM standards, any unit which has commenced constructionafter today's proposal date must meet whatever final NO<T2>x</T2> standard is promulgated.D. Selection of Best System of Particulate Matter Emission Reduction<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Natural Gas-Fired Small Steam Generating Units</ITAG>The uncontrolled PM emissions from the combustion of natural gas in smallsteam generating units are very low. Uncontrolled PM emission levels ofless than 9 ng/J (0.02 lb/million Btu) heat input are typical of naturalgas-fired steam generating units. Because of these low uncontrolled PMemission levels, the applicatioon of any type of PM control technologyto small natural gas-fired steam generating units would impose significantcosts for no benefit. Consequently, the use of any conventional PM controltechnology to reduce PM emissions from small natural gas-fired steam generatingunits is considered unreasonable and no further consideration has beengiven to the development of standards to limit PM emissions from theseunits.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Oil-Fired Small Steam Generating Units</ITAG>The SIP PM emission limits for small oil-fired units range from 130 to190 ng/J (0.30 to 0.45 lb/million Btu) heat input, depending on unit size.These emission limits can generally be met when firing high sulfur oilwith no add-on controls based on the correlation between fuel oil sulfurcontent and emissions of PM from oil combustion presented in the manual,``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors'' (AP-42). This correlation,which is based on data from over 100 steam generating units, indicatesthat PM emissions from fuel oils having a sulfur content of 1,290 ng/J(3.0 lb/million Btu) heat input would be about 95 ng PM/J (0.22 lb/millionBtu) heat input.This correlation between PM emissions and oil sulfur content indicatesthat reductions in PM emissions are a secondary benefit associated withreducing emissions of SO<T2>2</T2> through the combustion of low sulfur oils. As a result, theproposed standards limiting SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from oil combustion, which are based on the use ofvery low sulfur oil, also achieve reductions in PM emissions.Based on the data from AP-42, firing very low sulfur oil with a sulfurcontent of 215 ng/J (0.50 lb/million Btu) heat input or less will reducePM emissions to 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input or less. Thus,firing very low sulfur oil to comply with the SO<T2>2</T2> standard discussed below can be expected to reduce PM emissionsto 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input or less.Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems are also capable of reducing PMemissions from oil-fired steam generating units to 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/millionBtu) heat input or less. As a result, if a small oil-fired steam generatingunit were to fire a high sulfur oil and use an FGD system to comply withthe proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standard, this system would also reduce PM emissions to 43 ng/J(0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input.Use of add-on PM controls was considered for limiting emissions from smalloil-fired units beyond levels achievable either from combusting very lowsulfur oil or from using FGD systems if combusting high sulfur oil. Fabricfilters were not considered because fly ash from oil combustion is sticky,making these control systems ineffective on oil-fired units in general.Mechanical collectors also were not considered because they are ineffectivein collecting the small particle sizes of PM characteristic of oil combustion.Electrostatic precipitators have been used to control PM emissions fromsome oil-fired units. Although few data are available, these data indicatethat an ESP can reduce PM emissions to 22 ng/J (0.05 lb/million Btu) heatinput or less. The cost effectiveness of this additional emission reductionfrom 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) to 22 ng/J (0.05 lb/million Btu), however,is estimated to be over $110,000/Mg ($100,000/ton), which is considerdunreasonable.The proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards would reduce PM emissions from oil-fired units byrequiring the use of oils with a very low sulfur content that result inPM emissions of less than 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input or,if a high sulfur oil is fired, the use of an FGD system that will alsoreduce PM emissions to less than 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input.Any additional PM control on these units is considered unreasonable. Therefore,no PM emission limit is proposed for oil-fired units.Although combustion of very low sulfur oil results in low PM emissions,it is possible through incomplete combustion for PM emissions to increase.Incomplete combustion can result from poor maintenance or improper operation.In both cases, incomplete combustion is easily identified by increasedopacity at the stack, and if the opacity exceeds 20 percent this is a clearindication of incomplete combustion. For this reason, an opacity limitof 20 percent is proposed to allow identification of, and appropriate enforcementaction to be taken regarding, oil-fired units operating with incompletecombustion.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Coal-Fired Small Steam Generating Units</ITAG><T3>Coal PM Emissions and Control Techniques</T3>. Unlike PM emissionsfrom oil combustion, PM emissions from coal combustion cannot be correlatedto fuel sulfur content. Consequently, limiting SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from coal combustion through the use of low sulfurcoal will have little, if any, effect on PM emissions. Therefore, the proposedSO<T2>2</T2> standard for small coal-fired steam generating units achieveslittle, if any, reduction in PM emissions from these units.The SIP emission limits for PM emissions from small coal-fired units rangefrom 140 to 200 ng/J (0.33 to 0.46 lb/million Btu) heat input, dependingon steam generating unit size. The PM control system historically usedto meet these SIP emission limits is a single mechanical collector.Mechanical collection is a well-established technology using centrifugalseparation to remove particles from a gas stream. Mechanical collectorshave been widely used for years to control PM emissions from steam generatingunits firing coal. More recently, they have been used as flue gas precleaningdevices located upstream of more efficient PM control devices. Therefore,the regulatory baseline for PM emissions from small coal-fired units wasbased on the performance of a single mechanical collector.The emission control techniques evaluated for limiting PM emissions fromsmall coal-fired steam generating units include double mechanical collectors(DMC's), sidestream separators, wet FGD systems (wet scrubbers), fabricfilters, and ESP's.Double Mechanical Collectors. Most mechanical collectors consist of multiplesmall cyclone collectors connected in a parallel arrangement (multitubecyclone). A variation of this technology consists of two mechanical collectorsconnected in series. This latter configuration is referred to as a DMC.This arrangement typically achieves lower PM emission levels than a singlemechanical collector.To assess the performance of DMC's on coal-fired units, PM emissions datafrom nine sites were reviewed. The units ranged in heat input capacityfrom 15 to 60 MW (60 to 206 million Btu/hour) and were operated at 33 to100 percent of full load during the tests. In all the tests, PM emissionswere less than 130 ng/J (0.30 lb/million Btu). Therefore, DMC's are considereda demonstrated control technique for reducing PM emissions to 130 ng/J(0.30 lb/million Btu) heat input or less on coal-fired units.Although DMC's will reduce PM emissions from coal combustion, mechanicalcollectors in general are relatively ineffective for collecting PM<T2>10</T2>. As particle size approaches PM<T2>10</T2>, the control efficiency of mechanical collection systems dropssharply. Data from AP-42 indicate that the PM<T2>10</T2> removal efficiency of mechanical collection systems on coal-firedunits is less than 40 percent. Consequently, a large amount of the PM emittedfrom coal-fired units operating with DMC's is PM<T2>10</T2>. These smaller particle sizes are in the inhalable range andhave a greater potential for adverse health impacts.Sidestream Separators. A sidestream separator is a mechanical collectorfrom which a slipstream or ``sidestream'' of flue gas is routed to a smallfabric filter. In most cases, about 20 percent of the total flue gas volumepasses through the fabric filter, although in some cases it may approach50 percent of the total gas stream.Data were available for eight spreader stoker units ranging in heat inputcapacity from 9 to 29 MW (31 to 100 million Btu/hour) and retrofitted withsidestream separators. The units operated at loads ranging from 68 to 108percent of full capacity under relatively constant load conditions. Thepercentage of total flow sent to the fabric filter varied from 15 to 51percent. Particulate matter emissions in all tests were less than 86 ng/J(0.20 lb/million Btu). Sidestream separators, therefore, are considereda demonstrated control technique for reducing PM emissions from small coal-firedunits to 86 ng/J (0.20 lb/million Btu) or less.The available PM<T2>10</T2> emission control performance data for sidestream separatorsapplied to stoker steam generating units firing coal indicate an improvementin performance in comparison to mechanical collectors. The limited dataavailable indicate sidestream separators remove approximately 70 to 80percent of PM<T2>10</T2>.In addition, sidestream separators can be operated with a constant airflow rate through the fabric filter, thereby increasing the ratio of gasthrough the baghouse to total gas flow at reduced load and partially offsettingany deterioration in mechanical collector performance at reduced load.Over the full operating range, sidestream separators represent a methodof improving mechanical collector performance; however, the mechanicalcollector component of a sidestream separator must be well maintained toensure low overall emission rates. The small fabric filter used in thesidestream separator arrangement cannot offset poor performance of an inadequatelymaintained mechanical collector.Wet Scrubbers or Wet FGD Systems. A wet scrubber system uses an aqueousstream to remove PM from a gas stream. The available emissions data forwet scrubbers consisted of data for three wet scrubbers servicing coal-firedspreader stoker units. The units ranged from 37 to 69 MW (125 to 236 millionBtu/hour) heat input capacity and were operated at loads ranging from 73to 92 percent of full load during the tests.All three wet scrubbers were dual-alkali FGD systems designed with venturidevices for combined PM and SO<T2>2</T2> control and were preceded by mechanical collectors. Particulatematter emissions in all tests were less than or equal to 43 ng/J (0.10lb/million Btu) heat input. Because unit size has little effect on wetscrubber operation, wet scrubbers are considered a demonstrated controltechnique for reducing PM emissions from small coal-fired units to 43 ng/J(0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input or less.Fabric Filters. Fabric filters have been used on an increasing number ofsteam generating units in recent years. A fabric filtration system directsparticle-laden flue gas through a number of fabric bags where the particlescollect as a filter cake on the base surface. Data are available for fivecoal-fired spreader stoker units and two FBC units equipped with fabricfilters. The units ranged in heat input capacity from 13 to 59 MW (48 to208 million Btu/hour) and were operated at loads ranging from 71 to 100percent of full capacity.Fabric filters reduced PM emissions from each of the seven units to lessthan 22 ng/J (0.05 lb/million Btu) heat input. These data indicate thatfabric filter performance is not affected by unit design or size. Thus,fabric filters are considered a demonstrated control technique for reducingPM emissions from small coal-fired steam generating units to 22 ng/J (0.05lb/million Btu) heat input or less.Fabric filters have also been shown to be one of the most efficient PMcontrol techniques in controlling small particles, achieving more than99 percent removal efficiency for PM<T2>10</T2>. Fabric filters have been shown to be one of the most versatilehigh-efficiency PM emission control technologies and can readily be appliedto steam generating units firing a wide range of coals.Electrostatic Precipitators. Electrostatic precipitators remove PM fromsteam generating unit flue gases by electrically charging the suspendedparticles and precipitating them onto a collection plate or tube. Datawere available for ESP's on coal-fired units ranging from 27 to 110 MW(92 to 375 million Btu/hour) in heat input capacity. All tests resultedin PM emissions of less than 22 ng/J (0.05 lb/million Btu) heat input.All but one of the emission tests were conducted on units firing coalswith sulfur contents of 1.0 weight percent sulfur or less. A larger collectionarea is generally required to achieve a given PM collection efficiencyon low sulfur coal-fired units than on high sulfur coal-fired units. Thus,the above controlled emission levels would be achievable on units firinghigh sulfur coal with collection areas equal to or less than the collectionareas for low sulfur coal. Therefore, ESP's are considered a demonstratedcontrol technique for reducing PM emissions from coal-fired units to 22ng/J (0.05 lb/million Btu) heat input or less.The performance of ESP's is superior to mechanical collectors and sidestreamseparators, especially with respect to control of smaller particles. Testsof two coal-fired steam generators, for example, showed ESP's to have removalefficiencies of 99 percent for PM<T2>10</T2>.<T3>Analysis of Control Options</T3>. An emission rate of 130 ng/J (0.30lb/million Btu) heat input was selected as Control Option A for standardslimiting PM emissions from small coal-fired units. This option was basedon the use of a DMC. Emission rates of 86 ng/J (0./20 lb/million Btu) heatinput and 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input were selected as ControlOptions B and C, respectively. Control Option B was based on the use ofa sidestream separator and Control Option C was based on the use of a wetscrubber. Finally, an emission rate of 22 ng/J (0.05 lb/million Btu) wasselected as Control Option D. This option was based on the use of an ESPor a fabric filter. A summary of the control options for limiting PM emissionsfrom coal-fired units is presented in Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 1.<T4>_PM Control Options for Small Coal-Fired Units</T4><H1>Control option</H1><H1>PM emission level ng/J (lb/million Btu)</H1><H1>Basis </H1>a<ITAG tagnum="1">Control Option A<D>130 (0.30)</D><D>DMC.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Control Option B<D>86 (0.20)</D><D>SSS.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Control Option C<D>43 (0.10)</D><D>WS.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Control Option D<D>22 (0.05)</D><D>FF or ESP.</D><F/>a DMC=Double mechanical collector.<F>SSS=Sidestream separator.</F><F>WS=Wet flue gas desulfurization system.</F><F>FF=Fabric filter.</F><F>ESP=Electrostatic precipitator.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The costs associated with standards based on each of these control optionswere estimated for typical coal-fired units. For each control option, however,the least cost control system was used in estimating the costs associatedwith standards based on that control option.For a typical 15 MW (50 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity unit operatingat 55 percent (0.55) capacity factor, DMC's were the least cost optionto meet standards based on Control Option A, sidestream separators werethe least cost option to meet standards based on Control Option B, andfabric filters were the least cost option to meet standards based on ControlOptions C and D.The potential impacts on capital and annualized costs of standards basedon these options for this typical unit were also evaluated. Standards basedon Control Option A would increase capital costs by 2.3 percent over theregulatory baseline, and standards based on Control Option B would increasecapital costs by 3.7 percent over the baseline cost level. Standards basedon Control Option C or D would increase capital costs by 11 percent overthe regulatory baseline.Standards based on Control Option A (DMC) would increase annualized costsby 2 percent over the regulatory baseline and standards based on ControlOption B (sidestream separator) would increase annualized costs by about5 percent. Standards based on Control Option C or D (fabric filters) wouldincrease annualized costs by about 6 percent over the regulatory baseline.The cost-effectiveness levels associated with these control options werealso evaluated. Standards based on Control Option A have a cost effectivenessof $1,400/Mg ($1,200/ton). The incremental cost effectiveness of standardsbased on Control Option B over Control Option A is $5,400/Mg ($4,900/ton).The incremental cost effectiveness of standards based on Control OptionsC and D over Control Option B is $2,300/Mg ($2,100/ton), and the incrementalcost effectiveness of standards based on Control Options C and D over ControlOption A is $3,600/Mg ($3,300/ton).Because the incremental cost effectiveness of standards based on ControlOptions C and D is lower than that for standards based on Control OptionB, Control Option B is considered an ``inferior'' option and was not consideredfurther. Similarly, because Control Options C and D are effectively thesame option (fabric filters are less expensive than wet scrubbers and,at the same time, achieve lower PM emissions), Control Option C was alsonot considered further. Therefore, only Control Options A and D were usedto develop regulatory alternatives for further analysis.<T3>Analysis of Regulatory Alternatives.</T3> As mentioned previously,EPA has subdivided the small steam generating unit population into twodistinct segments: commercial-institutional and industrial. The coal-firedunits in these segments differ in both design and use. Whereas coal-firedunits in the industrial segment are located in manufacturing and otherproduction facilities, the commercial-institutional segment includes unitslocated at hospitals, colleges and universities, and elementary and secondaryschools. In general, commercial-institutional facilities are found in thesize range below 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity, whereasindustrial units are found above this size.Consequently, regulatory alternatives applying standards limiting PM emissionsfrom small coal-fired steam generating units of 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour)heat input capacity or larger, and from small coal-fired steam generatingunits of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity or larger, wereevaluated for their potential impacts. Applying standards only to smallcoal-fired steam generating units of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heatinput capacity or larger effectively serves to focus the regulation onmost industrial units and only the largest commercial-institutional units.Regulatory Alternative I was based on Control Option A (i.e., a DMC) forall units of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity or larger.Regulatory Alternative II was based on Control Option D (i.e., a fabricfilter or an ESP) for all units of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) or larger,whereas Regulatory Alternative III was based on Control Option D for allunits of 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) or larger. A summary of the regulatoryalternatives for coal-fired units is presented in Table 2.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 2.<T4>_PM Regulatory Alternatives for Small Coal-Fired Units</T4><H1>Regulatory alternative</H1><H1>Size range MW (million Btu/hour) </H1><H1>PM emission level ng/J (lb/million Btu)</H1><H1>Basis </H1>a<ITAG tagnum="1">I<D/>andCx.170;8.7 (30)<D>130 (0.30)</D><D>Control Option A.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">II<D/>andCx.170;8.7 (30) <D>22 (0.05)</D><D>Control Option D.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">III<D/>andCx.170;2.9 (10) <D>22 (0.05)</D><D>Control Option D.</D><F/>a Control Option A: Double mechanical collector.<F>Control Option D: Electrostatic precipitator or fabric filter. </F></ITAG></ITAG>Some 105 small coal-fired steam generating units between 2.9 MW (10 millionBtu/hour) and 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity are projectedto be constructed through the fifth year after proposal. Of these units,approximately 20 would be greater than 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heatinput capacity.National PM emission reductions from coal are estimated to be 500 Mg/year(600 tons/year) for standards based on Regulatory Alternative I; 900 Mg/year(1,000 tons/year) for standards based on Regulatory Alternative II; and1,700 Mg/year (1,900 tons/year) for standards based on Regulatory AlternativeIII.Solid wastes associated with PM standards for coal-fired units would resultfrom the disposal of the PM captured by the control devices. However, inthe absence of standards, steam generating units already generate a significantamount of solid waste in the form of ash. Compared to the regulatory baseline,solid waste generation would increase by about 1 percent, 2 percent, and4 percent for standards based on Regulatory Alternatives I, II, and III,respectively. These projected impacts on solid waste generation are consideredsmall. In addition, the wastes generated by PM control processes are nonhazardousand can be disposed of using traditional treatment and disposal techniqueswithout leading to adverse environmental impacts. No water pollution impactsare projected for any of these regulatory alternatives because they areall based on dry control techniques.There would be no significant impacts on national fuel use markets fromstandards based on any of the regulatory alternatives. Some fuel switchingmay occur, but the impact of any fuel switching from coal would be negligibleon a national basis. Energy consumption impacts resulting from standardsbased on any of the regulatory alternatives would be small.Compared to the regulatory baseline, national annualized costs associatedwith PM standards for small coal-fired units are projected to increaseby about $970,000/year for standards based on Regulatory Alternative I,about $3.2 million/year for standards based on Regulatory Alternative II,and about $10 million/year for standards based on Regulatory AlternativeIII.The national incremental cost effectiveness of standards based on RegulatoryAlternative I over the regulatory baseline is projected to be $2,000/Mg($1,800/ton). The national incremental cost effectiveness of standardsbased on Regulatory Alternative II over I is projected to be $5,300/Mg($4,800/ton). The national incremental cost effectiveness of standardsbased on Regulatory Alternative III over II is projected to be $9,000/Mg($8,100/ton).For individual steam generating units subject to standards based on RegulatoryAlternative I, cost-effectiveness values range from $900/Mg to $4,200/Mg($800/ton to $3,800/ton), depending on unit size and capacity factor. Forindividual units subject to standards based on Regulatory Alternative II,cost-effectiveness values range from $2,800/Mg to $7,200/Mg ($2,500/tonto $6,600/ton). For individual units subject to Regulatory AlternativeIII, cost-effectiveness values range from $2,800/Mg to $14,000/Mg ($2,500/tonto $13,000/ton).Although the cost effectiveness of standards based on Regulatory AlternativeII or III is relatively high, these regulatory alternatives reflect theuse of the most effective PM emission control technologies available (i.e.,fabric filters or ESP's). These control technologies have been used widelyon all sizes and types of steam generating units within the industrialsegment of the small steam generating unit population and frequently serveas the basis for State emission limitations applicable to small coal-firedunits. Furthermore, fabric filters are used as standard equipment on almostall fluidized bed combustion (FBC) units, and as the use of FBC technologybecomes more widespread, fabric filters will become even more prevalentin the small steam generating unit size category.In addition to providing effective control of total PM emissions, standardsbased on Regulatory Alternative II or III would be very effective in controllingemissions of PM<T2>10</T2>. Particulate matter emissions from coal combustion containconsiderable amounts of PM<T2>10</T2>. Because PM<T2>10</T2> emissions are in the inhalable size range, they can pose significantadverse health consequences. Health risks posed by inhalable particulatesare affected by both the penetration and the deposition of particles invarious regions of the respiratory tract, and by biological responses tothe deposited materials. Particles smaller than 10 microns in diametercan reach the deepest portion of the lung, the alveolar region. Clearanceof deposited materials from this region through normal breathing can takemonths to years. Possible responses to the deposited particles includereduced lung function, damage to lung tissues, increased susceptibilityto infection, and aggravation or potentiation of cardiopulmonary diseases.Standards based on Regulatory Alternative II or III also represent themost effective control systems for controlling trace metals and other compoundsfrom coal combustion that are considered toxic to humans. Trace metalsin coal include arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, cooper, chromium, manganese,mercury, and nickel. Certain trace metals are found in greater concentrationsin the PM<T2>10</T2> size range. Because of their effectiveness in controlling fineparticulates, fabric filters and ESP's are considered the most effectivetechnologies for controlling trace metal emissions from small coal-firedsteam generating units.The EPA solicits comments on how trace metals and PM<T2>10</T2> should be considered in the analysis. The EPA also requestscomment on how the proposed NSPS should interact with the existing newsource review (NSR) program, prevention of significant deterioration (PSD)program, and national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulatematter.Standards established under section III of the Act are part of the NationalAir Toxics Strategy adopted in 1985. Consequently, selection of RegulatoryAlternative II or III (i.e., fabric filters or ESP's) as the basis of standardsfor small coal-fired steam generating units would further the policy objectivecontained in that strategy of reducing toxic compound emissions, includingtrace metal emissions.The national incremental cost effectiveness associated with standards basedon Regulatory Alternative III [i.e., units of 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour)heat input capacity or larger] is significantly higher than the nationalincremental cost effectiveness associated with standards based on RegulatoryAlternative II [i.e., units of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat inputcapacity or larger]. In addition, as mentioned previously, the potentialburden imposed by standards differs significantly by population segment.This occurs because steam generating units smaller than 8.7 MW (30 millionBtu/hour) heat input capacity are primarily commercial-institutional units.Operators at commercial-institutional facilities are more likely to workpart-time or have other duties in addition to operating the steam generatingunit. As a result, these operators frequently have little or no trainingor skills in terms of operating sophisticated emission control equipmentsuch as fabric filters or ESP's. At industrial facilities, on the otherhand, operators are employed full-time and generally have been providedthe training necessary to run the systems effectively. Commercial-institutionalfacilities are also more likely to have a higher operator turnover ratethan industrial facilities due to the lower pay for operators at commercial-institutionalfacilities.In light of the higher cost-effectiveness of standards based on RegulatoryAlternative III over Regulatory Alternative II and the significant burdenstandards based on Regulatory Alternative III would place on small commercial-institutionalunit owners and operators, Regulatory Alternative III is considered unreasonable.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Wood-Fired Small Steam Generating Units.</ITAG><T3>Wood PM Emissions and Control Techniques.</T3> The SIP emission limitsfor PM emissions from small wood-fired steam generating units range from160 to 170 ng/J (0.37 to 0.40 lb/million Btu) heat input, depending onunit size. The PM control system typically used to meet these limits isa single mechanical collector. Therefore, the regulatory baseline for PMemissions from small wood-fired units was based on the performance of asingle mechanical collector.The emission control techniques evaluated for limiting PM emissions fromsmall wood-fired steam generating units included DMC's, wet scrubbers,and ESP's. Fabric filters were not evaluated because of the potential firehazard associated with the use of a fabric filter on wood-fired units.<T3>Double Mechanical Collectors. </T3>As discussed previously, DMC's consistof two single mechanical collectors connected in series. Based on availabledata, DMC's are considered a demonstrated control technique for reducingPM emissions to 130 ng/J (0.30 lb/million Btu) heat input or less on wood-firedunits.<T3>Wet Scrubbers. </T3>As mentioned above, a wet scrubber system usesan aqueous stream to remove PM from a gas stream. Based on available dataon wood-fired units, wet scrubbers are considered a demonstrated emissioncontrol technique for reducing PM emissions from wood-fired units to lessthan 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input.<T3>Electrostatic Precipitators. </T3>As discussed above, ESP's removePM from steam generating unit flue gases by electrically charging the suspendedparticles and precipitating them onto a collection plate. Based on availabledata for ESP's on wood-fired units, ESP's are considered a demonstratedtechnology for reducing PM emissions from wood-fired steam generating unitsto 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) heat input or less.<T3>Analysis of Control Options.</T3> An emission rate of 130 ng/J (0.30lb/million Btu) heat input was selected as Control Option A for standardslimiting PM emissions from small wood-fired units. This option was basedon the use of a DMC. An emission rate of 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu)heat input was selected as Control Option B. This option was based on theuse of a wet scrubber or an ESP. A summary of the control options for limitingPM emissions from wood-fired units is presented in Table 3.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>PM Control Options for Small Wood-Fired Units</T4><H1>Control option</H1><H1>PM emission level ng/J (lb/million Btu)</H1><H1>Basis </H1>a<ITAG tagnum="1">Control option A<D>130 (0.30)</D><D>DMC.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Control option B<D>43 (0.10)</D><D>WS or ESP.</D><F/>a DMC=Double mechanical collector.<F>ESP=Electrostatic precipitator.</F><F>WS=Wet flue gas desulfurization system.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The potential impacts on capital and annualized costs of standards basedon these options were evaluated for a typical 15 MW (50 million Btu/hour)heat input capacity wood-fired steam generating unit operating at 55 percent(0.55) capacity factor. Standards based on Control Option A (DMC) wouldincrease capital costs by 2.7 percent over the regulatory baseline, andstandards based on Control Option B (wet scrubber or ESP) would increasecapital costs by 19 percent over the regulatory baseline. Standards based on Control Option A would increase annualized costs by2.4 percent over the regulatory baseline, and standards based on ControlOption B would increase annualized costs by 10 percent over the regulatorybaseline. In calculating the annualized costs for the typical unit, thecost of the lowest cost coal was used to represent the cost of wood.The cost effectiveness associated with standards based on each of thesecontrol options was also evaluated for a typical wood-fired unit. The incrementalcost effectiveness of standards based on Control Option A compared to theregulatory baseline for a typical unit is $1,400/Mg ($1,300/ton). The incrementalcost effectiveness of standards based on Control Option B over ControlOption A for a typical unit is $7,200/Mg ($6,600/ton).<T3>Analysis of Regulatory Alternatives. </T3>The potential national impactsof standards based on three regulatory alternatives were examined. RegulatoryAlternative I would apply standards based on Control Option A (i.e., aDMC) to all units of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity orlarger. Regulatory Alternative II would apply standards based on ControlOption B (i.e., a wet scrubber or an ESP) to all units of 8.7 MW (30 millionBtu/hour) heat input capacity or larger, whereas Regulatory AlternativeIII would apply such standards to all units of 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour)heat input capacity or larger.

Ofthese units, approximately 30 would be greater than 8.7 MW (30 millionBtu/hour) heat input capacity. National PM emissions from wood are expected to be reduced by 1,000 Mg/year(1,100 tons/year) if standards are based on Regulatory Alternative I, 1,700Mg/year (1,800 tons/year) for standards based on Regulatory AlternativeII, and 2,200 Mg/year (2,400 tons/year) for standards based on RegulatoryAlternative III. As stated previously, steam generating units generate a large amount ofsolid waste in the absence of standards. Solid wastes associated with PMstandards for wood-fired units are projected to increase by about 3 percentover the regulatory baseline for standards based on Regulatory AlternativeI, about 5 percent for standards based on Regulatory Alternative II, andabout 6 percent for standards based on Regulatory Alternative III. Theseprojected impacts on solid waste generation are considered small. In addition,the wastes produced by PM control processes are nonhazardous and can bedisposed of using traditional treatment and disposal techniques withoutleading to any adverse environmental impacts. No significant water pollutionimpacts are projected for any of these regulatory alternatives. Significant impacts on national fuel use markets would not result fromstandards based on any of the regulatory alternatives. Some fuel switchingmay occur, but the impacts of any fuel switching from wood would be negligibleon a national basis. Energy consumption impacts resulting from standardsbased on any of the regulatory alternatives would be small. National annualized costs associated with PM standards for small wood-firedsteam generating units are estimated to increase by $1.4 million/year overthe regulatory baseline for standards based on Regulatory Alternative I,$6.2 million/year over the regulatory baseline for standards based on RegulatoryAlternative II, and $9.4 million/year over the regulatory baseline forstandards based on Regulatory Alternative III. For standards based on Regulatory Alternative I, the national cost effectivenessof the PM standards applied to small wood-fired steam generating unitswould be $1,400/Mg ($1,300/ton) over the regulatory baseline. The nationalincremental cost effectiveness of standards based on Regulatory AlternativeII would be $7,100/Mg ($6,500/ton) compared to standards based on RegulatoryAlternative I, and the national incremental cost effectiveness of standardsbased on Regulatory Alternative III would be $9,400/Mg ($8,600/ton) comparedto standards based on Regulatory Alternative II. For individual steam generating units subject to standards based on RegulatoryAlternative I, cost-effectiveness values range from $900/Mg to $4,300/Mg($800/ton to $3,900/ton), depending on unit size and capacity factor. Forindividual units subject to standards based on Regulatory Alternative II,cost-effectiveness values range from $6,000/Mg to $18,000/Mg ($5,400/tonto $16,000/ton). For individual units subject to Regulatory AlternativeIII, cost-effectiveness values range from $6,000/Mg to $28,000/Mg ($5,400/tonto $25,000/ton). The national incremental cost effectiveness of standards based on RegulatoryAlternative II or III is relatively high. These regulatory alternatives,however, reflect the use of the most effective PM emission control technologiesavailable (i.e., ESP's or wet scrubbers). Standards based on these alternativeswould not only result in greater overall PM emission reduction, but wouldalso result in much greater control of PM<T2>10</T2> emissions. Standards based on Regulatory Alternatives II andIII would also result in reductions in emissions of polycyclic organicmatter (POM), a carcinogenic substance that is emitted from small wood-firedsteam generating units. In addition, the control techniques that serve as the basis for RegulatoryAlternatives II and III have also been used widely for control of emissionsfrom small wood-fired steam generating units, and these control techniquesfrequently serve as the basis for State emission limitations applicableto small wood-fired units. As mentioned previously, the potential burden imposed by standards differssignificantly by population segment. This occurs because steam generatingunits smaller than 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity areprimarily commercial-institutional units. Operators at commercial-institutionalfacilities are more likely to work part-time, or have other duties in additionto operating the steam generating unit. As a result these operators frequentlyhave little or no training in the operation of sophisticated emission controlequipment such as fabric filters or ESP's. At industrial facilities, onthe other hand, operators are employed full-time and generally have beenprovided the training necessary to run the systems effectively. Commercial-institutionalfacilities are also more likely to have a higher operator turnover ratethan industrial facilities due to the lower pay for operators at commercial-institutionalfacilities. In light of the higher cost effectiveness of standards based on RegulatoryAlternative III over Regulatory Alternative II and the significant burdenstandards based on Regulatory Alternative III would place on small commercial-institutionalunit owners and operators, Regulatory Alternative III is considered unreasonable.E. Selection of Best System of Sulfur Dioxide Emission Reduction <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Natural Gas-Fired Small Steam Generating Units </ITAG>The uncontrolled SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from the combustion of natural gas in steam generatingunits are very low. Uncontrolled SO<T2>2</T2> emission levels of less than 0.43 ng/J (0.001 1b/million Btu)heat input are typical of natural gas-fired steam generating units. Becauseof these low uncontrolled SO<T2>2</T2> emission levels, the application of any control technology tonatural gas-fired steam generating units would entail unreasonable costs,and no further consideration was given to the development of standardsof performance to limit SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from units firing natural gas.   <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Coal-Fired Small Steam Generating Units </ITAG><T3>Coal SO</T3><T2>2</T2><T3> Emissions and Control Techniques. </T3>The regulatory baseline SO<T2>2</T2> emission level for small coal-fired steam generating units isbased on the national average SIP emission limit for small coal-fired units.Sulfur dioxide emission limits for small coal-fired units range from 1,400to 1,510 ng/J (3.3 to 3.5 lb/million Btu) for units of 29 and 2.9 MW (100and 10 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity, respectively. The overallnational average SIP emission limit is 1,460 ng/J (3.4 lb/million Btu)heat input. Projected fuel prices, however, are available only for coalscapable of meeting SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits of 1,550 and 1,120 ng/J (3.6 and 2.6 lb/millionBtu) heat input. As a result, a regulatory baseline of 1,550 ng/J (3.6lb/million Btu) heat input was selected for purposes of analysis. A consideration that is always important when evaluating SO<T2>2</T2> control technologies for steam generating units is the selectionof an appropriate averaging period. Sulfur dioxide emissions from steamgenerating units vary as a result of the normal variation in fuel sulfurcontent. As a result of this variability, data must be averaged over someperiod of time to assess emission control system performance. The longerthe averaging period selected, the less the variability in fuel sulfurcontent affects the emission rate and the more accurate, or representative,the measured emission rate becomes as an indicator of the continuous performanceof the system. From the perspective of enforcement, however, the longerthe averaging period selected to measure performance, the longer the periodbetween the time a source begins to operate and the time an initial assessmentcan be made of whether that source is in compliance. An averaging period of 30 days is long enough to yield results that accuratelyrepresent the continuous performance of a control system, but is shortenough to permit timely enforcement of a standard after a new source beginsoperation. In addition, a 30-day rolling average permits continued enforcementof the standard on a daily basis after the initial 30-day period had beencompleted. As a result, a 30-day rolling average was selected for assessingthe performance of low sulfur fuels, FGD technologies (sodium scrubbingFGD systems, dual alkali FGD systems, lime/limestone FGD systems, and limespray drying FGD systems), and FBC for the purpose of developing standardsof performance limiting SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed small steamgenerating units. Low Sulfur Coal. Use of low sulfur coal limits SO<T2>2</T2> emissions by reducing the amount of sulfur available in thefuel for SO<T2>2</T2> formation. Low sulfur coal is defined as coal that can meetan emission limit of 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/million Btu) heat input on a continuousbasis using a 30-day rolling average without additional SO<T2>2</T2> control. Low sulfur coal is obtained primarily from naturally occurring low sulfurcoal deposits. Low sulfur coal may also be produced through physical coalcleaning to reduce the naturally occurring sulfur content. Low sulfur coalcan be burned in any small steam generating unit designed to fire coal,so its applicability is not limited by steam generating unit size. Coal markets supplying coals with low sulfur contents [520 ng/J (1.2 lb/millionBtu) heat input or less] have developed throughout the Nation. Becauseof widespread availability and extensive use of low sulfur coal for steamgenerating purposes, use of low sulfur coal is considered to be a demonstratedtechnique for reducing SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small steam generating units. Sodium Scrubbing FGD Systems. Sodium scrubbing FGD systems employ an aqueoussolution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or sodium carbonate (Na<T2>2</T2>CO<T2>3</T2>) in the scrubber to absorb SO<T2>2</T2> from the steam generating unit flue gas. Sodium scrubbing FGDtechnology has been applied to small coal-fired units and is commerciallyavailable for all sizes of units. Emission test data are available to document sodium scrubber performancefor coal firing. Thirty days of certified CEM test data were gathered froma sodium scrubber applied to a pulverized coal-fired steam generating unitrated at 55 MW (188 million Btu/hour) heat input. The unit operated atloads between 40 and 60 percent of full load and averaged 48 percent offull load for the test duration. The sulfur content of the coal fired was3.6 weight percent. The design SO<T2>2</T2> efficiency of this system was 90 percent at an inlet SO<T2>2</T2> concentration of 2,000 ppmv. An analysis of available data shows consistently high SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiencies, averaging 96 percent for the test period.The daily average outlet SO<T2>2</T2> emissions ranged from 56 to 270 ng/J (0.13 to 0.62 lb/millionBtu) heat input, averaging 86 ng/J (0.20 lb/million Btu) heat input forthe 30-day test period. This test shows that 90 percent or greater SO<T2>2</T2> removal can be consistently achieved on a high sulfur coal-firedsteam generating unit operated at normal, but less than maximum load. Asodium scrubbing system could also operate at this level of performanceunder full load conditions by adjusting the reagent addition rate and scrubbingliquor feed rate to maintain constant sodium-to-sulfur and liquid-to-gasratios. Although the sodium scrubber in this 30-day test was applied to a unitrated above 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity, the performancedata from this scrubber are applicable to small steam generating units.This application can be made because sodium scrubber design and operatingcharacteristics (e.g., liquid-to-gas ratio, pH, gas distribution, etc.)do not vary significantly with unit size in this general size range. Asa result, the performance of smaller sodium scrubbing FGD systems wouldbe similar to that of the scrubber discussed above. Thus, achievement ofa 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction by sodium scrubbing FGD systems on small coal-firedunits on a 30-day rolling average basis is considered demonstrated. Dual Alkali FGD Systems. The dual alkali FGD process is similar to sodiumscrubbing FGD in the absorption stage; both technologies use a clear sodiumsolution for SO<T2>2</T2> removal. However, dual alkali FGD includes a regeneration stagewhere lime or limestone is used to regenerate the active sodium alkalifor SO<T2>2</T2> sorption. Dual alkali FGD technology has been applied primarilyto large coal-fired units, but is commercially available for units of allsizes. Tests of dual alkali FGD systems operating on coal-fired steam generatingunits have shown short-term SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiencies of greater than 90 percent, with long-termefficiencies of around 92 percent. Emission data are available from two long-term tests to document dual alkaliFGD system performance for coal-fired steam generating units. The dualalkali FGD system tested consisted of two SO<T2>2</T2> absorbers, each serving a separate steam generating unit, anda single regeneration section. Seventeen days of test data were gatheredfrom one absorber applied to a coal-fired spreader stoker steam generatingunit rated at 40 MW (135 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity, and 24days of test data were gathered from the other absorber applied to a unitrated at 23 MW (77 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity. Data were collectedusing continuous SO<T2>2</T2> emission monitors on both the inlet and outlet of the FGD system.The sulfur content of the bituminous coal received at the plant duringthese tests averaged 1,490 ng/J (3.47 lb/million Btu) heat input. Duringthese tests, the steam generating units also burned oil with an averagesulfur content of 320 ng/J (0.74 lb/million Btu) heat input. During bothtests, the dual alkali FGD system operated at a reliability level of 100percent. In the 17-day test, the steam generating unit operated at an average loadof 67 percent, with the load varying between 42 and 96 percent. The SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency averaged 92 percent. In the 24-day test,the steam generating unit operated at an average load of 62 percent, withloads varying between 5 and 95 percent. The SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency averaged 92 percent. Results of the 24-day test show that 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> removal can be reliably and consistently achieved on a smallcoal-fired steam generating unit. In addition, the result of the 17-daytest indicate that the SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency achieved on a steam generating unit largerthan 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity is essentially thesame as that achieved on a steam generating unit smaller than 29 MW (100Million Btu/hour) heat input capacity. This same level of performance canbe achieved at full load conditions if vigorous gas-liquid contact is maintainedin the absorber and the sodium-to-sulfur and liquid-to-gas ratios are maintainedat a level sufficient to provide an adequate supply of active sodium species.  Based on these analyses of system performance, dual alkali FGD is a demonstratedtechnology for reducing SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small coal-fired industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating units by 90 percent on a 30-day rolling average basis.Lime/Limestone FGD Systems. Lime/limestone FGD systems employ a slurryof calcium oxide or calcium carbonate to remove SO<T2>2</T2> from industrial-commercial-institutional steam generating units.Emission data from two long-term tests are available to document lime/limestoneFGD performance on six coal-fired stoker steam generating units with atotal heat input capacity of 62 MW (210 million Btu/hour).The tests were conducted using continuous SO<T2>2</T2> emissions monitors at both the inlet and outlet of the FGD system.Data were collected for a 29-day period while the system used a lime reagentand for 30 days while the system used a limestone reagent in the wet scrubbingsystem.During the 29-day data collection period when lime was used as the reagent,the sulfur content of the bituminous coal fired averaged 2,200 ng/J (5.0lb/million Btu) heat input. During this period, the steam generating unitload varied from 34 to 65 percent of full load. The SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency averaged 92 percent, and the reliabilityof the lime wet scrubbing FGD system exceeded 91 percent.During the 30-day test period when limestone was used as the reagent, thesulfur content of the bituminous coal burned averaged about 2,200 ng/J(5.0 lb/million Btu) heat input. During this period, the steam generatingunit load varied from 30 to 67 percent of full load. The SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency averaged 94 percent, and the system reliabilitywas 94 percent.Although these results were obtained at less than maximum load conditions,new systems could achieve this level of performance at full load by operatingat a higher liquid-to-gas ratio. In addition, a new system would likelybe equipped with a spray tower or turbulent contact absorber to provideincreased mass transfer area and gas residence time for improved SO<T2>2</T2> absorption. Therefore, lime/limestone FGD systems are consideredto be a demonstrated SO<T2>2</T2> technology for achieving 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reductions on a 30-day rolling average basis from small steamgenerating units.Lime Spray Drying FGD Systems. Lime spray drying is a dry scrubbing processthat involves contacting the flue gas with an atomized lime slurry or asolution of sodium carbonate. The hot flue gas dries the droplets to forma dry waste product while the sorbent reacts with SO<T2>2</T2> in the flue gas. The dry waste solids, consisting of sulfiteand sulfate salts, unreacted sorbent, and fly ash are collected in a baghouseor an ESP for disposal.Emission test data from a series of four short-term tests are availableto document lime spray drying performance for coal firing. These four short-termtests, which lasted from 1 to 8 hours, were conducted on units rangingin heat input capacity from 34 MW (115 million Btu/hour) to 82 MW (280million Btu/hour). The sulfur contents of the coals fired in these unitsranged from 410 ng/J (0.96 lb/million Btu/hour) heat input to 2,800 ng/J(7.0 lb/million Btu) heat input. The resulting SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiencies from these tests averaged in excess of93 percent.These high removal efficiency values indicate that lime spray drying systemsare capable of achieving 90 percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emission from industrial-commercial-institutional steam generatingunits. Furthermore, due to similarities in design and operation betweenlarge and small systems, lime spray dryers are capable of achieving the90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction levels on small industrial-commercial-institutionalunits. Therefore, lime spray drying is considered a demonstrated SO<T2>2</T2> control technology for achieving 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reductions on a 30-day rolling average basis from small coal-firedsteam generating units.<T3>Fluidized Bed Combustion. </T3>Fluidized bed combustion is a steamgenerating unit design which, because of its ability to incorporate limestoneaddition, can achieve significant SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions. This technology offers a variety of advantagesover conventional steam generating unit designs, including SO<T2>2</T2> emission reduction without the use of FGD systems as well asgreater flexibility in fuel use.Atmospheric fluidized bed combustion (AFBC) steam generating units havedeveloped rapidly over the past 5 years and are now being applied to smallsteam generating unit sizes. The two primary AFBC design alternatives thatare currently available are the bubbling fluidized bed (with or withoutsolids recycle) and the circulating fluidized bed. Pressurized FBC technologyhas been under development for over a decade, but has not yet been usedin commercial practice and is unlikely to be applied to small units.Emission data were analyzed for one circulating bed and four bubbling bedFBC units ranging in size from 15 to 61 MW (50 to 210 million Btu/hour)heat input capacity. The results indicate that SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiencies ranged from 86 to 99 percent for testson the four bubbling bed units. The outlet SO<T2>2</T2> emissions for a 15 MW (50 million Btu/hour) heat input capacitybubbling bed unit at Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, averaged 26, 430,and 260 ng/J (0.06, 1.0, and 0.60 lb/million Btu) heat input for test durationsof 5 hours, 15 hours, and 7.5 days, respectively. Based on coal sulfurcontent, these values correspond to a 91 to 99 percent SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency. Emission data were also collected over a30-day test period for this unit, with an overall average for the 30 daysof 94 percent. The daily average SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency ranged from 73 to 97 percent. The lower dailyaverage SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency of 73 percent occurred on a single day andwas attributed to operating the unit at a low calcium/sulfur ratio.Although these performance levels are based primarily on bubbling bed designs,equal or better performance is expected from circulating and dual bed systemsbecause of more rapid carbon burnout, higher limestone particle densitiesin the freeboard area, and more uniform gas-solid contact between SO<T2>2</T2> and limestone.As a result, FBC is considered a demonstrated SO<T2>2</T2> control technology for achieving 90 percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions on a 30-day rolling average basis from small coal-firedsteam generating units.<T3>Analysis of Control Options.</T3> The analysis of SO<T2>2</T2> control options examined, from the perspective of individualsteam generating units, the potential impacts of various control optionsthat could serve as the basis for regulatory alternatives limiting SO<T2>2</T2> emissions. The analysis compared the impacts for various controloptions based on demonstrated SO<T2>2</T2> emission control techniques relative to a regulatory baselineand to each other. A summary of the SO<T2>2</T2> control options analyzed for coal-fired units appears in Table5 below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 5.<T4>_SO</T4><T2>2</T2> <T4>Control Options for Small Coal-Fired Units</T4><H1>Control option</H1><H1>SO</H1><T2>2</T2> emission level ng/J (lb/million Btu)<H1>Basis</H1>Coal:<ITAG tagnum="3">Control option A</ITAG><D>520 (1.2)</D><D>Low sulfur coal.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Control option B</ITAG><D>90% SO</D><T2>2</T2> reduction<D>FGD or FBC </D>a.<F/>a FGD=Flue Gas Desulfurization.<F>FBC=Fluidized Bed Combustion.</F></ITAG>As discussed above, the evaluation of SO<T2>2</T2> control techniques for small coal-fired units indicates thatboth low sulfur coal and FGD/FBC technology are demonstrated SO<T2>2</T2> control techniques for small coal-fired units. Low sulfur coalcombustion will reduce SO<T2>2</T2> emissions to 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/million Btu) heat input or less.This technique, therefore, was selected as Control Option A for coal-firedunits. Flue gas desulfurization systems and FBC units are capable of 90percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction from small coal-fired units. Consequently, 90 percentSO<T2>2</T2> reduction was selected as Control Option B for coal-fired units.For a typical small coal-fired steam generating unit [i.e., 15 MW (50 millionBtu/hour) size unit operating at a 55 percent (0.55) capacity factor],the SO<T2>2</T2> emissions at the regulatory baseline are 310 Mg/year (340 tons/year).The emission reduction achieved by Control Option A (i.e., standards basedon the use of low sulfur coal) compared to the regulatory baseline is 190Mg/year (210 tons/year), whereas the emission reduction achieved by ControlOption B over the regulatory baseline is 280 Mg/year (310 tons/year).Capital costs of SO<T2>2</T2> control relative to the regulatory baseline would increase byabout 1 percent for standards based on Control Option A and by about 30percent for standards based on Control Option B. The annualized cost comparedto the regulatory baseline would increase by about 6 percent for standardsbased on Control Option A and by about 30 percent for standards based onControl Option B.The costs associated with standards based on Control Option B (i.e., standardsrequiring a 90 percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions) were based on an average of the costs of sodium scrubbingand dual alkali FGD systems. The costs of the other three demonstratedpercent reduction technologies_lime/limestone FGD, lime spray drying FGD,and FBC_are within the range of costs associated with sodium scrubbingand dual alkali FGD systems and, thus, an average of the costs of sodiumscrubbing and dual alkali FGD systems is considered representative of thecosts that would be imposed on small steam generating units by a requirementto achieve a 90 percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions.The cost effectiveness of SO<T2>2</T2> emission control associated with standards based on ControlOption A over the regulatory baseline would be about $630/Mg ($570/ton).The incremental cost effectiveness of standards based on Control OptionB over Control Option A would be about $4,900/Mg ($4,500/ton).The incremental cost effectiveness of standards based on Control OptionB relative to standards based on Control Option A is quite high. For smallcoal-fired steam generating units of less than 22 MW (75 million Btu/hour)heat input capacity, for example, the incremental cost effectiveness ofstandards based on Control Option B over standards based on Control OptionA exceeds $3,700/Mg ($3,300/ton). Similarly, the incremental cost effectivenessof standards based on Control Option B over standards based on ControlOption A for all coal-fired units within the source category operatingat annual capacity factors less than 55 percent (0.55) exceeds $3,700/Mg($3,300/ton). Consequently, no further consideration was given to optionsor alternatives requiring a percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions for small coal-fired steam generating units of lessthan 22 MW (75 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity or small coal-firedsteam generating units operating at annual capacity factors of less than55 percent (0.55).<T3>Analysis of Regulatory Alternatives.</T3> The analysis of regulatoryalternatives examined the potential national impacts of various NSPS onboth the industrial and commercial-institutional segments of the smallsteam generating unit population. The national impacts that would occurin the fifth year after proposal of the standards for small steam generatingunits were analyzed in terms of national SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions, national increased annualized costs, nationalincremental cost effectiveness, as well as secondary environmental andenergy impacts.As shown in Table 6, SO<T2>2</T2> standards for coal-fired steam generating units were evaluatedfor three regulatory alternatives: Regulatory Alternative I, representingstandards based on the use of low sulfur coal [520 ng/J (1.2 lb/millionBtu)] for units with a heat input capacity of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour)or greater; Regulatory Alternative II, representing standards based onthe use of low sulfur coal for units with a heat input capacity of 2.9MW (10 million Btu/hour) or greater; and Regulatory Alternative III, representingstandards requiring a 90 percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions for small steam generating units greater than 22 MW(75 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity that operate at an annual capacityfactor above 55 percent (0.55) and standards based on the use of low sulfurcoal for all other small coal-fired steam generating units with heat inputcapacities of 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) or greater.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>6._<T4>SO</T4><T2>2</T2> <T4>Regulatory Alternatives for Small Coal-Fired Units</T4><H1>Regulatory alternative</H1><H1>Size range MW (million Btu/hour)</H1><H1>SO</H1><T2>2</T2> Emission Level ng/J (1b/million Btu)<H1>Basis</H1>b<ITAG tagnum="1">I<D/>andCx.170;8.7 (30)<D>520 (1.2)</D><D>Control option A.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">II<D/>andCx.170;2.9 (10)<D>520 (1.2)</D><D>Control option A.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">III<D>andgreater;22 (75) and andgreater;55% CF</D>a<P/>andCx.170;2.9 (10)<D>90% SO</D><T2>2</T2> reduction<P>520 (1.2)</P><D>Control option B.</D><P>Control option A.</P><F/>a CF = Capacity factor.<F/>b Control option A = Low sulfur coal.<F>Control option B = Flue gas desulfurization or fluidized bed combustion.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Some 105 small coal-fired steam generating units between 2.9 and 29 MW(10 and 100 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity are projected to be constructedthrough the fifth year after proposal. Of these units, approximately 20would be greater than 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity.Estimated national SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions of 4,200 Mg/year (4,600 tons/year) wouldresult from a standard for coal-fired units based on Regulatory AlternativeI, and SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions of 9,500 Mg/year (11,000 tons/year) wouldresult from a standard for coal-fired units based on Regulatory AlternativeII as well as a standard for coal-fired units based on Regulatory AlternativeIII. Projected national impacts associated with standards for small coal-firedsteam generating units based on Regulatory Alternatives II and III arethe same since the analysis projects no new coal-fired steam generatingunits operating at annual capacity factors exceeding 55 percent (0.55).No significant water pollution impacts are projected for small coal-firedsteam generating units under any of the regulatory alternatives, and theprojected impacts on solid waste generation are also negligible. Standardsbased on any of the regulatory alternatives for small coal-fired steamgenerating units would not result in significant energy impacts on nationalfuel use markets. Some fuel switching from coal to natural gas or distillateoil may occur, but the impact of any fuel switching on coal markets wouldbe negligible on a national basis. Energy consumption impacts resultingfrom standards based on any of the regulatory alternatives for small coal-firedsteam generating units would be small.National annualized emission control cost increases over baseline or coal-firedunits are estimated to be $1.8 million for a standard based on RegulatoryAlternative I, and $5.9 million for a standard based on Regulatory AlternativeII or a standard based on Regulatory Alternative III.The national incremental cost effectiveness of a standard based on RegulatoryAlternative I would be about $560/Mg ($400/ton) compared to the regulatorybaseline. The national incremental cost effectiveness of a standard basedon Regulatory Alternative II or on Regulatory Alternative III would beabout $800/Mg ($700/ton). Because no coal-fired units are projected tobe built through the fifth year in the size range affected by the percentreduction requirement, the cost effectiveness of a standard based on RegulatoryAlternative III would be the same as for Regulatory Alternative II.For individual steam generating units subject to standards based on RegulatoryAlternative I, cost-effectiveness values range from $600/Mg to $1,100/Mg($500/ton to $1,000/ton), depending on unit size and capacity factor. Forindividual units subject to standards based on Regulatory Alternative II,cost-effectiveness values range from $600/Mg to $2,100/Mg ($500/ton to$1,900/ton). For individual units subject to Regulatory Alternative III,cost-effectiveness values range from $600/Mg to $3,700/Mg ($500/ton to$3,300/ton).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Oil-Fired Small Steam Generating Units</ITAG><T3>Oil SO</T3><T2>2</T2> <T3>Emissions and Control Techniques. </T3>The regulatory baseline SO<T2>2</T2> emission level for small oil-fired steam generating units isbased on the national average SIP emission limit for small oil-fired units.The SIP emission limits for oil are essentially independent of steam generatingunit size, and the national average SIP SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit for small oil-fired units is 1,010 ng/J (2.35lb/million Btu) heat input. Projected fuel prices, however, are availablefor oils capable of meeting SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits of 1,290 and 690 ng/J (3.0 and 1.6 lb/millionBtu) heat input, but not 1,010 ng/J (2.35 lb/million Btu) heat input. Asa result, a regulatory baseline of 1,290 ng/J (3.0 lb/million Btu) heatinput was selected for purposes of analysis.The control techniques considered for reducing SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small oil-fired steam generating units includeuse of oils with reduced sulfur contents (i.e., medium sulfur oil, lowsulfur oil, and very low sulfur oil), sodium scrubbing FGD, dual alkaliFGD, and lime/limestone FGD.Medium, Low, and Very Low Sulfur Oils. The sulfur content of fuel oil determinesthe SO<T2>2</T2> emission rate of oil-fired steam generating units. Table 7 presentsthe oil classification scheme used to represent fuel oils fired in steamgenerating units. In this classification scheme, oil is classified by itssulfur content. This classification scheme originated from classificationsused by the U.S. Department of Energy to study fuel oil use patterns andto report refinery production data. The classifications reflect the factthat many distillate and residual oils are produced to meet market demandscreated by existing Federal, State, and local SO<T2>2</T2> emission regulations. For example, ``low sulfur'' distillateand residual fuel oils can be fired to meet the 1971 NSPS (40 CFR Part60, Subpart D) emission limit of 340 ng/J (0.80 lb/million Btu) heat inputfor steam generating units with a heat input capacity greater than 73 MW(250 million Btu/hour), or more stringent standards adopted by State orlocal governments.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>7._SO<T2>2</T2><T4> Emission Rates for Various Oil Types</T4><H1>Oil type</H1><H1>SO</H1><T2>2</T2> emission rate, ng/J (lb/million Btu)<ITAG tagnum="1">Very Low Sulfur<D>215 (0.50)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Low Sulfur<D>340 (0.80)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Medium Sulfur<D>690 (1.6)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">High Sulfur<D>1,290 (3.0)</D></ITAG></ITAG>Fuel oils with low sulfur contents are generally produced by refining lowsulfur content crude oils. Although both distillate oils and low sulfurresidual oils can be produced from any crude oil, most low sulfur residualoils are produced from low sulfur crude oils and/or by blending with lowersulfur oils. Low sulfur oils can be fired in any steam generating unitdesigned to fire oil, although different burners may be required to achievegood combustion and fuel heating may be required to reduce viscosity forpumping and proper atomization at the burner tip.A distinction exists between the sulfur content of most residual oils anddistillate oil. Residual oils are generally higher in sulfur content andgenerally have a wider range of sulfur contents than distillate oil. Thesulfur content of residual oil, for example, can vary from as little as0.3 weight percent to over 3.0 weight percent. Although the sulfur contentof distillate oil can be as low as 0.2 weight percent, the maximum sulfurcontent is limited to 0.5 weight percent by fuel oil specifications adoptedby the ASTM.Medium sulfur residual oil is widely available throughout the United States.Generally speaking, low and very low sulfur residual oils are not widelyavailable throughout the United States. Distillate oil, however, is widelyavailable. The maximum sulfur content of distillate oil (0.5 weight percent),therefore, serves as a useful benchmark for identifying the sulfur contentof those very low sulfur fuel oils that are widely available throughoutthe United States. In a few areas, both distillate oil and very low sulfurresidual oils with sulfur contents of less than 215 ng/J (0.5 lb/millionBtu) heat input are available.Because of their national availability and extensive use in small steamgenerating units, medium sulfur oils and very low sulfur oils (distillateoil and very low sulfur residual oils) are considered demonstrated controltechniques for reducing SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small steam generating units.Sodium Scrubbing FGD Systems. Sodium scrubbers are the most extensivelyused wet FGD systems on industrial steam generating units and have beenapplied widely on small oil-fired units. Sodium scrubbers used in theseapplications are package systems that are skid-mounted, shipped to thesite, and installed for operation with a minimum of on-suite fabrication. Sulfur dioxide emissions data were analyzed for 20 oil-fired steam generatorsequipped with sodium scrubbers and operated to produce steam for tertiaryoil recovery. All SO<T2>2</T2> emission tests were short-term compliance tests (typically fora 3-hour period), and SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency ranged from 87.5 to 99.5 percent for oilshaving sulfur contents ranging from 0.6 to 1.7 weight percent. Steam generatingunit operating loads ranged from 67 to 108 percent of full load. Sulfurdioxide removal efficiency for these 20 sodium scrubbers averaged 95 percent.The average SO<T2>2</T2> outlet emissions were 30 ng/J (0.07 lb/million Btu) heat input.Thus, the ability of sodium scrubbers to reduce SO<T2>2</T2> emissions by 90 percent on a 30-day rolling average basis fromsmall oil-fired units is considered demonstrated.Dual Alkali FGD Systems. Dual alkali technology has been applied primarilyto coal-fired units. Emissions data are available, however, for one dualalkali system applied to an oil-fired steam generating unit. The SO<T2>2</T2> removal performance of the dual alkali system applied to theoil-fired unit is comparable to that of coal-fired units. The data forthe oil-fired unit were obtained from a compliance test. The steam generatingunit had a heat input capacity of 91 MW (310 million Btu/hour), and thesulfur content of the oil fired as 1.5 weight percent. The outlet emissionswere 40 ng/J (0.09 lb/million Btu) heat input, and the SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency was 92 percent.Long-term performance data are not available for dual alkali systems operatingon small oil-fired steam generating units. However, the design and operatingprinciples for dual alkali technology are similar for both coal- and oil-firedunits. Thus, the performance of these systems on oil-fired units can beevaluated from anayzing their performance on large and small coal-firedunits. These test data were discussed above, and the average SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiency of these scrubbers was 92 percent. Therefore,the ability of dual alkali scrubbers to reduce SO<T2>2</T2> emissions by 90 percent on a 30-day rolling average basis fromsmall oil-fired steam generating units is considered demonstrated.Lime/Limestone FGD Systems. Although no emission data are available todocument the performance of lime/limestone FGD systems on oil-fired steamgenerating units, emission data are avaiable for lime and limestone FGDsystems applied to small and large coal-fired units. These data, whichwere discussed above, show SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiencies for lime and limestone FGD systems of 91.5and 94 percent, respectively. Due to the similarity in system design andoperation, lime/limestone FGD is considered a demonstrated control technologyfor achieving a 90 percent reductin in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions on a 30-day rolling average basis from small oil-firedgenerating units. <T3>Analysis of Control Options.</T3> The analysis of SO<T2>2</T2> control options examined, from the perspective of individualsteam generating units, the potential impacts of various control optionsthat could serve as the basis for regulatory alternatives limiting SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small oil-fired units. The analysis comparedthe impacts for various control options based on demonstrated SO<T2>2</T2> emissions control techniques relative to a regulatory baselineand to each other. A summary of the SO<T2>2</T2> control options analyzed for oil-fired units appears in Table8 below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>8._<T4>SO</T4><T2>2</T2> <T4>Control Options for Small Oil-Fired Units </T4><H1>Control option </H1><H1>SO</H1><T2>2</T2> emission level ng/J(lb/million Btu) <H1>Basis</H1>Oil<ITAG tagnum="1">Control option A <D>690 (1.6) </D><D>Medium sulfur oil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Control option B <D>215 (0.50) </D><D>Very low sulfur oil.</D>a</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Control option C <D>90% SO</D><T2>2</T2> reduction <D>FGD.</D>b <F/>a Distillate oil. <F/>b FGD=Flue gas desulfurization.</ITAG></ITAG>The evaluation of SO<T2>2</T2> control techniques for small oil-fired units indicates thatmedium sulfur oil, very low sulfur oil, and FGD systems are demonstratedtechniques that could serve as the basis for developing NSPS for smallunits. The use of medium sulfur oil will reduce SO<T2>2</T2> emissions to 690 ng/J (1.6 lb/million Btu) heat input; therefore,this technique was selected as Control Option A for oil-fired units. Verylow sulfur oil combustion will reduce SO<T2>2</T2> emissions to 215 ng/J (0.50 lb/million Btu) heat input; therefore,this technique was selected as Control Option B for oil-fired units. Fluegas desulfurization systems are capable of 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> emission reduction and, as a result, 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction was selected as Control Option C for small oil-firedunits. Sulfur dioxide emission from a typical oil-fired unit [i.e., 15 MW (50million Btu/hour) heat input size and 55 percent (0.55) capacity factor]at the regulatory baseline are 330 Mg/year (360 tons/year). Compared tothe regulatory baseline, standards based on Control Option A (i.e., standardsbased on the use of medium sulfur oil) would reduce emissions by about150 Mg/year (170 tons/year). Control Option B (i.e., standards based onthe use of very low sulfur oils) would reduce emissions by about 300 Mg/year(325 tons/year). Control Option C (i.e., standards based on 90 percentSO<T2>2</T2> reduction) would reduce emissions by about 305 Mg/year (335tons/year). The potential impacts on capital costs of standards based on these optionswere evaluated for a typical oil-fired unit. Compared to the regulatorybaseline, standards based on Control Option A would increase capital costsby less than 1 percent, and standards based on Control Option B would increasecapital costs by less than 1 percent. Standards based on Control OptionC, however, would increase capital costs by about 80 percent. Compared to the regulatory baseline, standards based on Control OptionA would increase annualized costs for this unit by about 3 percent andstandards based on Control Option B would increase annualized costs byabout 20 percent. Standards based on Control Option C would increase annualizedcosts by about 40 percent. The cost effectiveness of SO<T2>2</T2> control associated with standards based on Control Option Acompared to the regulatory baseline is about $330/Mg ($300/ton), and theincremental cost effectiveness of SO<T2>2</T2> control associated with standards based on Control Option Bcompared to standards based on Control Option A is about $1,500/Mg ($1,400/ton).The incremental cost effectiveness of SO<T2>2</T2> control associated with standards based on Control Option Ccompared to standards based on Control Option B is very high and exceeds$11,000/Mg ($10,000/ton) for all oil-fired steam generating units. Consequently,no further consideration was given to options or alternatives requiringa percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small oil-fired steam generating units. <T3>Analysis of Regulatory Alternatives. </T3>The analysis of regulatoryalternatives examined the potential national impacts of various NSPS onboth the industrial and commercial-institutional segments of the smallsteam generating unit population. The national impacts that would occurin the fifth year after proposal of the standards for small steam generatingunits were analyzed in terms of national SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions, national increased annualized costs, nationalincremental cost effectiveness, as well as secondary environmental andenergy impacts.As shown in Table 9, the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards for oil-fired steam generating units were evaluatedfor three regulatory alternatives: Regulatory Alternative I, representingstandards based on the use of medium sulfur oil [690 ng/J (1.6 lb/millionBtu) heat input] for units of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu) heat input capacityor greater; Regulatory Alternative II, representing standards based onthe use of medium sulfur oil [690 ng/J (1.6 lb/million Btu) heat input]for units of 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity or greater;and Regulatory Alternative III, representing standards based on the useof very low sulfur oil [215 ng/J (0.50 lb/million Btu) heat input] forall oil-fired units of 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input capacityor greater. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>9._SO<T2>2</T2> <T4>Regulatory Alternatives for Small Oil-Fired Units </T4><H1>Regulatory alternative </H1><H1>Size range MW (million Btu/hour) </H1><H1>SO</H1><T2>2</T2> emission level ng/J (lb/million Btu) <H1>Basis</H1>a<ITAG tagnum="1">I<D/>andCx.170;8.7 (30) <D>690 (1.6) </D><D>Control option A.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">II<D/>andCx.170;2.9 (10)<D>690 (1.6)</D><D>Control option A.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">III<D/>andCx.170;2.9 (10) <D>215 (0.50) </D><D>Control option B.</D><F/>a Control option A=Medium sulfur coal.

Of these units, approximately 335would be greater than 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity.Estimated national SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions over the regulatory baseline are about 8,600Mg/year (9,400 tons/year) for a standard for small oil-fired units basedon Regulatory Alternative I; about 10,000 Mg/year (11,000 tons/year) fora standard based on Regulatory Alternative II; and about 25,000 Mg/year(27,000 tons/year) for a standard based on Regulatory Alternative III.No significant water pollution impacts are projected for small oil-firedsteam generating units under any of the regulatory alternatives, and theprojected impacts on solid waste generation are also negligible. Standardsbased on any of the regulatory alternatives for small oil-fired steam generatingunits would not result in significant energy impacts on national fuel usemarkets. Some fuel switching from residual oil to natural gas or distillateoil may occur, but the impact of any fuel switching on oil and naturalgas markets would be negligible on a national basis. Energy consumptionimpacts resulting from standards based on any of the regulatory alternativesfor small oil-fired steam generating units would be small.National annualized emission control cost increases over baseline costswere estimated to be $4.3 million for a standard based on Regulatory AlternativeI; $5.0 million for a standard based on Regulatory Alternative II; and$22.8 million for a standard based on Regulatory Alternative III.The national incremental cost effectiveness of a standard based on RegulatoryAlternative I would be about $500/Mg ($400/ton) compared to the regulatorybaseline. The national incremental cost effectiveness of a standard forsmall oil-fired units based on Regulatory Alternative II would be about$600/Mg ($500/ton), and the national incremental cost effectiveness ofa standard based on Regulatory Alternative III would be about $800/Mg ($700/ton).For individual steam generating units subject to standards based on eitherRegulatory Alternative I or Regulatory Alternative II, cost-effectivenessvalues remain essentially constant at about $400/Mg ($300/ton), independentof unit size and capacity factor. For individual units subject to standardsbased on Regulatory Alternative III, cost-effectiveness values range fromabout $1,400/Mg to $1,600/Mg ($1,300/ton to $1,500/ton), depending on unitsize and capacity factor.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. National Economic Impacts</ITAG>The analysis of the national economic impacts of standards was performedseparately for the two major segments of the small steam generating unitpopulation. For the industrial segment, the analysis focused on six majorindustry groups: food and kindred products, textile mill products, paperand allied products, chemicals and allied products, petroleum and coalproducts, and primary metals industries. An examination of potential productprice impacts, assuming full cost pass through and 100 percent replacementof existing process steam, for ``worst case'' facilities in each of thesesix categories showed product price increases typically less than 1 percent.For the most steam intensive industries, product prices under the ``worstcase'' were projected to increase by 2.8 percent. Potential price increaseswould be significantly less at the national level because only a smallpercentage of process steam in these industries would be affected by theproposed standard. Industries that are more likely to experience adverseimpacts because of the steam intensity of their production process wereselected for further analysis. None of the selected industries experiencedsignificant adverse economic impacts as a result of the proposed standards.For the commercial-institutional segment, economic impacts were assessedin terms of the costs of control as a percent of annual budgets (expressedas annual revenues) for five major categories of facilities. These fivetypes of facilities included laundries, hotels, hospitals, colleges, andsecondary schools. Most commercial-institutional facilities would not beaffected by the proposed standards because most of these facilities usesteam generating units with heat input capacities of less than 2.9 MW (10million Btu/hour) and most use natural gas. Of the commercial-institutionalfacilities with steam generating units subject to the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> and PM standards, the annual costs of pollution control weregenerally less than 0.5 percent of annual revenues. In other words, costsof services would typically increase by less than 0.5 percent. For themost steam intensive commercial facility, the annual costs of pollutioncontrol were 1.3 percent of annual revenues.Economic impacts for the commercial-institutional segment were also measuredin terms of the potential impact of the proposed standards on the rentalrates of typical commercial and institutional buildings. Five differentsize categories of buildings were examined, ranging from less than 25,000square feet (sq ft) to those over 200,000 sq ft in size. In each case,small steam generating units sized for the building were assumed to beused for space and water heating purposes.The analysis of rental rate impacts showed that the proposed standardscould potentially increase building rental rates by about 1 percent fora typical building smaller than 25,000 sq ft in size and less than 0.5percent for a building larger than 25,000 sq ft in size.Actual rental rate impacts, however, are expected to be even less thanthis because these rental rate impacts assume the use of residual oil,and the relatively low baseline rental rates assumed for the analysis producea somewhat exaggerated effect on percentage increases in rental rates.In addition, it is unlikely that steam generating units of 2.9 MW (10 millionBtu/hour) heat input or larger would be installed in a building as smallas 25,000 sq ft in size, and it is unlikely that owners/operators of buildingsbelow 200,000 sq ft in size would install a new residual oil-fired unit.It is much more likely that a steam generating unit installed in a commercial-institutionalbuilding smaller than 200,000 sq ft in size would use natural gas or distillateoil since units firing these fuels require much less maintenance and operatorattention than units firing residual oils. Thus, the projected impactson building rental rates are considered ``worst case.''The analysis of the potential national and economic impacts associatedwith various regulatory alternatives for standards limiting emissions fromsmall steam generating units does not identify any potential impacts thatare considered unreasonable. Based on the above-described analysis of controloptions, regulatory alternatives, national impacts, and economic impactsof standards limiting emissions of SO<T2>2</T2> and PM from small steam generating units, the proposed standardsare based on PM Regulatory Alternative II for coal and wood, and on SO<T2>2</T2> Regulatory Alternative III for coal and oil. The standards limitingPM emissions from small steam generating units would establish an emissionlimit of 22 ng/J (0.05 lb/million Btu) heat input for coal-fired unitswith a heat input capacity of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) or greater andwould establish an emission limit of 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) heatinput for wood-fired units in the same size range. The standard limitingSO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small coal-fired steam generating units wouldrequire a 90 percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from units of greater than 22 MW (75 million Btu/hour)heat input capacity that operate at an annual capacity factor greater thana 55 percent (0.55). Sulfur dioxide emissions from small coal-fired steamgenerating units of 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour) or less, but greater thanor equal to 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour), would be limited to 520 ng/J(1.2 lb/million Btu) heat input. The standard limiting SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small oil-fired steam generating would limitemissions to 215 ng/J (0.50 lb/million Btu) heat input for all oil-firedunits with heat input capacities of 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour) or less,but greater than or equal to 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour).F. Modification and Reconstruction ProvisionsExisting steam generating units that are modified or reconstructed wouldbe subject to the requirements in the General Provisions (40 CFR 60.14and 60.15) that apply to all NSPS. Few, if any, changes typically madeto existing steam generating units would be expected to bring such steamgenerating units under the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> or PM standards.A modification is any physical or operational change to an existing facilitythat results in an increase in emissions. Changes to an existing facilitythat do not result in an increase in emissions, either because the natureof the change has no effect on emissions or because additional emissioncontrol technology is employed to offset an increase in emissions, arenot considered modifications. In addition, certain changes have been exemptedunder the General Provisions (40 CFR 60.14). These exemptions include:routine maintenance, repair, and replacement; production increases achievedwithout a capital expenditure as defined in section 60.2; production increasesresulting from an increase in the hours of operation; addition or replacementof equipment for emission control (as long as the replacement does notincrease emissions); relocation or change of ownership of an existing facility;and use of an alternative fuel or raw material if the existing facilitywere designed to accommodate it. In addition, both Section III of the CAAand 40 CFR 60.14 of the General Provisions exempt mandatory conversionsto coal.Reconstruction of an existing facility could make that facility subjectto an NSPS regardless of any change in the emission rate, depending onthe cost of the replaced components and the feasibility of meeting thestandards. Reconstructed steam generating units would become subject tothe proposed standards under the reconstruction provisions, regardlessof changes in emission rate, if the fixed capital cost of reconstructionexceeds 50 percent of the cost of an entirely new steam generating unitof comparable design and if it is technologically and economically feasibleto meet the applicable standards. Costs associated with steam generatingunit routine maintenance are not included in determining reconstructioncosts.G. Performance Test Methods and Monitoring RequirementsThe performance testing and emission monitoring requirements included inthe proposed regulation would apply to all small steam generating unitssubject to the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> or PM standards, except as noted below.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Sulfur Dioxide</ITAG>The proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standard for small coal-fired steam generating units includesprovisions for monitoring of SO<T2>2</T2> emissions to demonstrate continuous compliance with the standards.Use of a CEMS at the inlet and outlet of the SO<T2>2</T2> control device would be required for coal-fired units subjectto a percent reduction requirement. Data collected from the CEMS wouldbe used to determine compliance with the emission limits in accordancewith Reference Method 19 (Appendix A). As-fired fuel sampling and analysisat the inlet to the steam generating unit or emissions measurement in accordancewith Reference Method 6B could be used in lieu of CEMS.Affected facilities for which only an emission limit has been proposedwould be able to monitor SO<T2>2</T2> emissions using any of the procedures included in Method 19(Appendix A) or other approved alternative procedures. These proceduresinclude as-fired fuel sampling and analysis, stack sampling, or operationof a single CEMS at the outlet of the SO<T2>2</T2> control device.If fuel sampling and analysis is used, a representative sample would becollected each steam generating unit operating day and would be analyzedfor sulfur content. This value would be used to calculate the emissionrate for that day.Compliance with the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit for small coal-fired steam generating units wouldbe based on a 30-day rolling average of data collected during the previous30 consecutive steam generating unit operating days. (Hourly values wouldbe computed when using a CEMS; daily values would be computed when usingMethod 6B or fuel sampling.) The first 30-day average SO<T2>2</T2> emission rate calculated after initial unit start-up would serveas the initial performance test required under 40 CFR section 60.8. Thereafter,a new 30-day rolling average emission rate would be calculated each steamgenerating unit operating day.Under the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards for small coal-fired steam generating units, each30-day rolling average would be calculated using all of the data collectedduring the previous 30 consecutive steam generating unit operating days.Although all data collected must be used in calculating each 30-day average,the proposed standards include provisions to account for periods when datacannot be collected due to equipment failure. These provisions requirethat data must be gathered by fuel sampling and analysis or stack samplingfor a minimum of 22 days within each 30 consecutive steam generating unitday period.If a small coal-fired steam generating unit were to fire other fuels periodically,such as natural gas, distillate oil, or wood, 24-hour periods during whichthese other fuels are the only fuels fired would not be considered smallsteam generating unit operating days for purposes of determining compliancewith the SO<T2>2</T2> standards. Emissions of SO<T2>2</T2> from the combustion of natural gas, distillate oil, and othersuch fuels are so low that including these emissions in the 30-day rollingaverage calculations for coal-fired units would serve only to ``dilute''the reported emission values. Consequently, only those 24-hour periods(as defined in the proposed standards) during which some coal is firedin the small steam generating unit would constitute small steam generatingunit operating days.Twenty-four-hour periods during which both coal and other fuels are fired,however, would be considered small steam generating unit operating days.In such cases, one method of determining compliance with the SO<T2>2</T2> standard would be the use of as-fired fuel sampling and analysisof the coal. If a small steam generating unit simultaneously combusts coalwith another fuel and uses a CEMS to determine complinace with the SO<T2>2</T2> standard, an adjusted hourly SO<T2>2</T2> emission rate would be used in Equation 19-19 of Reference Method19 to compute an adjusted 30-day average emission rate.In order to ensure that CEMS provide accurate data, daily calibration driftchecks and quarterly accuracy audits would be required for each CEMS. Thesequality assurance checks would be performed in accordance with 40 CFR Part60, Appendix F, Procedcure 1, ``Quality Assurance Requirements for GasContinuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination.''The proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standard for small oil-fired steam generating units includesprovisions for monitoring of SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small residual oil-fired steam generating unitsto demonstrate continuous compliance with the standards. No SO<T2>2</T2> monitoring requirement would apply to small distillate oil-firedsteam generating units. Monitoring of SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from small residual oil-fired units would be accomplishedthrough the use of fuel sampling and analysis, Method 6B, or CEMS. Datacollected would be used to determine compliance with the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits in accordance with Reference Method 19 (AppendixA).If fuel sampling and analysis is used to determine compliance at a smallresidual oil-fired steam generating unit, an as-fired daily oil samplecan be taken and analyzed. As an alternative to the use of daily fuel sampling,a representative sample could be collected from the oil supply tank forthe steam generating unit after each fuel delivery. This sample could beanalyzed for sulfur content and then used as the daily value when calculatingthe 30-day rolling average SO<T2>2</T2> emission rate until the next oil shipment is received. Uponreceipt of a new oil shipment, a new sample from the oil supply tank wouldbe collected after the oil tank has been refilled, analyzed, and then usedas the new daily average. It is assumed that adequate mixing would occuras the oil tank is being filled, so that a sample taken from the tank afterfilling would accurately represent the sulfur content of the oil in thetank.As with coal, compliance with the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits for small residual oil-fired steam generatingunits would be based on a 30-day rolling average of data collected duringthe previous 30 consecutive steam generating unit operating days (hourlyvalues when using CEMS, daily values when using Method 6B or fuel samplingand analysis). The same minimum data requirements for coal-fired unitsalso apply to oil-fired units. As with coal, if a small steam generatingunit combusts oil with another fuel and uses CEMS to determine compliancewith the SO<T2>2</T2> standard, an adjusted hourly SO<T2>2</T2> emission rate would be used in Equation 19-19 of Reference Method19 to compute an adjusted 30-day average emission rate.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Particulate Matter</ITAG>The performance test methods and monitoring requirements for PM would applyto coal- and wood-fired small steam generating units, except as noted below.Performance tests would be conducted in accordance with Reference Method5, Reference Method 5B, or Reference Method 17 (40 CFR Part 60, AppendixA). Reference Method 1 would be used for determining the number and locationof sampling points. Reference Method 3 would be used for flue gas analysis.After the initial performance test, subsequent performance tests may berequired by enforcement personnel. All performance tests would consistof a minimum of three runs using Reference Method 5, Reference Method 5B,or Reference Method 17 at full-load operating conditions (i.e., full capacity).The average PM emission rate of the three runs would be used to determinecompliance. Reference Method 17 could be used in place of Reference Method5 for facilities without wet FGD systems that have stack gas temperaturesof less than 160 anddegrees;C (320 anddegrees;F). For facilities with wet FGDsystems, Reference Method 5B would be used.The performance test methods and monitoring requirements for opacity wouldapply to coal-, oil-, and wood-fired units. Reference Method 9 (a 6-minuteaverage of 24 observations) would be used to determine initial compliancewith the proposed 20 percent opacity standard for all three fuels. A transmissometerwould be used to demonstrate proper operation and maintenance of the controldevice after completion of the initial performance test for coal-, oil-,and wood-fired units.The opacity standard provides an inexpensive indicator of PM control systemperformance. To account for factors such as unusually large diameter stacksor other site specific unique circumstances that might influence opacity,provisions are available in 40 CFR 60.11(e) to obtain a site-specific opacitystandard when a facility is unable to comply with the applicable opacitystandard, but demonstrates compliance with the applicable PM emission limit.H. Reporting and Recordkeeping RequirementsThe proposed standards would require owners and operators of all smallsteam generating units to submit notifications of unit construction orreconstruction, date of anticipated startup, date of actual startup, andanticipated date of demonstration of the CEMS (if applicable), as requiredunder the General Provisions (40 CFR 60.7). In addition, this notificationwould include a description of the fuel(s) to be fired in the small steamgenerating unit.After the initial performance tests have been completed, the proposed standardswould require submission of quarterly reports. For small coal- and residualoil-fired steam generating units, these reports would include all 30-dayrolling average SO<T2>2</T2> emission rates calculated during the reporting period, as wellas identification of any periods for which data were excluded from thesecalculations. In addition, each quarterly report would include the resultsof the daily CEMS drift checks and quarterly accuracy audits as requiredunder Appendix F, Procedure 1. For small distillate oil-fired steam generatingunits, quarterly reporting of fuels fired would also be required. Thesereports must include a certified statement signed by the owner of the steamgenerating unit indicating that all fuels fired in the unit met the ASTMdefinition of distillate oil. For small coal-, wood-, and oil-fired steamgenerating units of 8.7 MW (30 million Btu/hour) heat input capacity orgreater, these reports would also include an excess emission report foropacity. If no excess emissions of opacity occur during a quarter, thenan excess emission report for opacity would not be required for that quarter,but would be required for the following quarter. Thus, as long as thereare no excess emissions of opacity, only semiannual excess emission reportsfor opacity are required.If the applicable SO<T2>2</T2> percent reduction requirement or emission limit is exceededduring the reporting period, the quarterly report would also describe thereason for the exceedance or failure to meet the requirement or limit andthe corrective action taken. If the minimum amount of SO<T2>2</T2> data (as discussed in ``Performance Test Methods and MonitoringRequirements'') was not obtained for any 30-day rolling average period,reasons for failure to obtain sufficient data and a description of correctiveaction taken would also be included, along with all information neededto calculate the 30-day average emission rates according to Method 19,Section 7. In addition, if the applicable PM emission limit or opacitystandard is exceeded, the quarterly report would also describe the reasonfor the exceedance and the corrective action taken.The proposed standards would also require that certain types of recordsbe maintained. Records to be maintained include records of the types andamounts of each fuel fired on each steam generating unit operating day;all data outputs of the CEMS, or results of fuel sampling and analysis;all quarterly reports submitted under this rulemaking; and all recordsrequired under Appendix F, Procedure 1. All required records would be maintainedfor 2 years following the date of such records, after which they couldbe discarded.The reporting and recordkeeping requirements in the proposed regulationare necessary to inform enforcement personnel as new small steam generatingunits begin operation. In addition, they would provide the data and informationnecessary to ensure continued compliance of small steam generating unitswith the proposed regulation. At the same time, these requirements wouldnot impose an unreasonable burden on small steam generating unit ownersor operators. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Administrative Requirements</ITAG>A.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires consideration of the impacts ofproposed regulations on small entities, including small businesses, organizations,and jurisdictions. A small business is defined as any business concernthat is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its fieldas defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations undersection 3 of the Small Business Act. Similarly, a small organization isdefined by the SBA as a not-for-profit enterprise, independently ownedand operated, and not dominant in its field. A small jurisdiction is definedas any government district with a population of fewer than 50,000 people.The proposed standard would apply to small steam generating units in smallbusinesses (defined as having 500 to 1,500 employees depending on the SICclassification) as well as large businesses. The proposed standard, however,would not affect a substantial number of small businesses. Most small businesseswill not be affected by the proposed standards because sales of new steamgenerating units are expected to remain at their current low levels. Newsmall steam generating units, therefore, are expected to be a relativelysmall percentage of the existing population of small steam generating unitsover the next five years. In addition, small steam generating units inthe commercial segment are used primarily for space heating and hot water.A relatively small percentage of commercial buildings will be impactedbecause (1) steam is not the predominant choice for heating new buildings,(2) most steam generating units used in commercial applications will besmaller than 2.9 MW (10 million Btu/hour) heat input, and (3) the predominantfuels used in commercial applications are natural gas and distillate oil,which will incur little or no compliance costs. An economic impact is considered significantly adverse if one of the followingfour criteria is met: Annual costs of compliance with the standard increase process or productcosts by more than five percent. Compliance costs as a percent of sales are at least ten percentage pointshigher for small businesses than for large businesses. Capital costs of compliance represent a significant portion of capitalavailable to small businesses. The standards are likely to result in closures of small businesses. The proposed standards would increase production costs by less than fivepercent, assuming full cost pass through, for ``worst case'' facilitiesin the most steam intensive industries. Impacts on product prices at thenational level are expected to be insignificant. In the commercial segment,rental rates for office buildings that are affected by the proposed standardswould increase by less than 1 percent. Compliance costs as a percent of sales or annual revenues were analyzedfor small and large businesses. This measure of the regulatory burden ofthe proposed standards would not be significantly higher for small businesses.The proposed standards would impose additional capital expenditures forfabric filters on new small coal-fired steam generating units. These additionalcapital costs, however, would increase the capital requirement for thepurchase of a new small steam generating unit by less than 10 percent.Finally, the additional costs associated with the proposed standards arenot expected to result in any business closures. Consequently, the proposedstandard will not result in significant adverse economic impacts on smallbusinesses. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 60 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations,Reporting and recordkeeping, Fossil fuel-fired steam generating units,Nonfossil fuel-fired steam generating units. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 1, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
