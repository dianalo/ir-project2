In the same way surgery may be the most efficienttreatment of lung metastases from tumors of extrapulmonary site. Thepreoperative investigations have to prove that in case of lung cancerthis is restricted to one hemithorax and in lung metastases that theseare restricted to the lungs exclusively. They also have to prove thatthe lung function allows adequate resection. This is mainly lobectomyand pneumonectomy, sometimes sleeve resection and rarely segmentectomyfor primary lung cancers. Resection of metastases preferably is by wedgeexcision or enucleation. In bilateral lesions median sternotomy is thefavoured approach to both lungs in a single session. Long term resultsin primary lung cancer depend on the tumor stage. As a rule of thumbby each step of tumor stage the 5-year-survival rate is cut to half.In regard to histology small cell undifferentiated carcinomas are consideredsurgical indications only in the very early stage and need to be treatedby adjuvant chemotherapy. The operative mortality is correlated to theextent of resection and by average is higher for primary carcinoma ofthe lung because of the usually higher age level and additional pulmonarydamage. Patients operated for pulmonary metastases, however, are in lowerage range and due to less functional risks, the operative mortality inmost series is between 0 and 3%. Early detection of lung cancer, i.e.,immediate and expert exploration of suspicious X-ray findings or respiratorysymptoms particularly in smokers and with asbestos exposed individualswill contribute to an increasing efficacy of surgical treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
