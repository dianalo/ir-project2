Yesterday, as OTC traders prepared for the changes, stocks moved slightly higher in generally dull trading. But the Nasdaq composite index slipped at the close to finish 0.01 point lower at 391.66. Volume was 147.8 million shares.    About 50.3 million shares in 964 securities advanced, while 38.2 million shares of 1,044 securities declined.    Among the most active Nasdaq stocks, Management Science America lost 1/8 to 11 3/8 on two million shares; Oracle Systems gained 1/2 to 20 1/8; and MCI Communications slipped 1/8 to 13 7/8.    Starting today, all market-makers in Nasdaq National Market System stocks must participate in a system called the small order execution system, which automatically executes customer orders of 1,000 shares or less at the best price.    Only about half of these market-makers used to participate in the system. With all of them participating, the number of phone calls made between market-makers to seek prices is expected to fall substantially. Telephone bottlenecks were a big problem during the Oct. 19 crash chaos.    The new rules from the National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs Nasdaq, also stipulate that the small-order system will always operate, no matter how volatile the market.    As NASD officials point out, the Brady commission report on the market crash concluded that if the new rules had been in effect last October, &quot;it is possible, if not probable, that most of the problems encountered in the execution of small orders in the over-the-counter market would not have occurred.&quot;    In addition to possible technical hitches, OTC traders say the major concern they will have starting today is the new NASD rule that bars them from trading a security for 20 business days if they are unable for more than five minutes to make a trade in it. The rule is designed to keep the market running consistently; but keeping track of the five-minute deadline will be a new headache for OTC firms.    &quot;It's like basketball -- you have time to shoot, and if you don't shoot you're dead,&quot; said Jeremiah Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter Reynolds, New York, which makes markets in 1,400 Nasdaq stocks.    The NASD recently decided not to start ordering the 20-day suspensions until July 11 to give brokers time to get used to the five-minute rule.    Other OTC officials privately say they worry about the increased opportunity for some brokerage firms to use the beefed-up small-order system to make rapid trades for their own accounts. The system is supposed to be strictly for customer orders. The NASD has brought enforcement actions in the past for violations of that ban.    In other market action yesterday, E.W. Scripps, a $128 million new issue and one of the biggest post-crash initial public offerings, started trading on Nasdaq. Cincinnati-based Scripps is the parent of the Scripps Howard media chain. The stock reached 16 1/2 before closing at 16, its offering price.    Henley Manufacturing surged 11 1/4 to 54 1/4. Its chairman agreed to acquire a 17.2% stake for $55 a share.    Leading the decliners list with a 22.7% fall was Circle Express. The Indianapolis-based trucker said it won't meet its 1988 earnings projection of 80 to 85 cents a share and expects to post a second-quarter loss. The stock fell 1 1/4 to 4 1/4. </TEXT></DOC>
