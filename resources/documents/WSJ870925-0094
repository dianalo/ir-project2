The company said the total interest is equivalent to 60 wells.    The total of the purchase prices is estimated at $13.4 million to $17.7 million. Actual prices depend on the ultimate acceptance by certain parties associated with the principal sellers, which the company wouldn't identify. A spokesman for Swift Energy did say, however, that the sellers involve three different parties from the U.S.    The agreements are expected to be completed within 30 days, the oil and gas exploration and development concern said. </TEXT></DOC>
