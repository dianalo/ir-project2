Thus, nitrogen oxides (NOsub(x)), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC),and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were determined for 10% blends ofMTHF, methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), ethanol and methanol, and comparedwith unleaded gasoline. The power output, specific fuel consumption,air-fuel ratios, equivalence ratios, and exhaust gas temperature werealso measured. The experiments were conducted on a 2.3 litre internalcombustion SI Ford Motor Company engine at wide-open throttle over enginespeeds of 2000, 2400, 2800 and 3200 rpm. The NOsub(x) emissions wereanalyzed spectrophotometrically while the NMHC and CO emissions wereanalyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector.The fuel blend containing 10% MTHF has power outputs and CO, NOsub(x),and NMHC emissions that most closely resemble unleaded gasoline.</TEXT></DOC>
