The new law on association, however, only grants politicalparties and new independent movements the right to exist. A separatelaw to be passed later this year will regulate the registration andoperation of political parties, according to officials.   Only then will two fledgling political parties and the dozens ofindependent political groups formed in recent months be able tofield candidates for parliament and for local councils.   The long-awaited laws on assembly and assocation were passed withan overwhelming majority in parliament a day after advocates ofgreater pluralism clashed with more orthodox Communists over thepace of reform.   Of the 387 deputies in Communist-ruled Hungary, only six opposedthe law on association and just seven voted against the law onassembly.   The debate on the two laws, which pitted reformers againstCommunist Party conservatives, was overshadowed by the announcementTuesday that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungarianterritory would begin soon.   Defense Minister Ferenc Karpati said the withdrawal of an armoreddivision, an air force battalion and several air force units couldbe completed soon, possibly before the end of the year.   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz was quoted by Hungarian mediaas having told a Japanese newspaper that withdrawal was only amatter of weeks away.   Karpati's remarks came as parliament adopted by an overwhelmingmajority a constitutional amendments including one that willfacilitate the introduction of an alternative civilian service forconscientious objectors.   Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar told the legislature the billsadopted today laid down the ``fundamental'' rights of citizens toassemble and to form associations, including political parties. Thehouse, however, did pass a measure banning demonstrations outsideParliament.   Janos Berecz, the Communist Party's leading ideologist, who isalso a deputy, called on independent groups that have mushroomed inHungary in the past year to ``help create cohesion and unity'' onthe road to socialism, saying pluralism within the current one-partysystem was sufficient.</TEXT></DOC>
