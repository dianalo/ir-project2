These economists said they expect the Fed to increase itsdiscount rate, the interest the central bank charges on loans tomember banks, from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.   The Fed has already executed a series of three tightening movesbeginning in late March, but it has held back from increasing itsdiscount rate, which is the most dramatic move the central bank canmake to demonstrate its intention to push interest rates higher.   The last change in the discount rate occurred last September,when it was increased from 5.5 percent to 6 percent. That hike hasbeen blamed in part for precipitating the October collapse of stockprices.   The central bank's policy-making committee, the Federal OpenMarket Committee, meets Wednesday and Thursday behind closed doorsto discuss the conduct of monetary policy. Fed Chairman AlanGreenspan will report on the panel's deliberations in an appearancebefore the Senate Banking Committee on July 13.   Many economists believe the Fed is ready to tighten creditconditions even further because of inflationary pressures in theU.S. economy.   Lyle Gramley, a former member of the Fed, said he believed thecentral bank probably would raise the discount rate in July,especially if the unemployment report for June indicates a surge innew jobs.   ``The Fed's main concern has to be that the economy may begrowing too fast and that pressure on wages and prices will bebuilding as the year goes on,'' said Gramley, who is now chiefeconomist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.   Gramley said he was looking for the increase in the discountrate to occur in July because he believes the central bank willwant to get it over with well before the fall presidential electioncampaign.   ``The Fed doesn't like to raise the discount rate if politicalcriticism can be generated, but they also don't want the rate toget so far out of touch with the market that they are open tocriticism that they are subsidizing banks who are borrowing fromthem,'' he said.   In late March and then again in early May and late May, the Fedacted to tighten interest rates by restricting the amount of moneybanks have for making loans. The central bank's goal was torestrain credit and thereby restrain overall demand in the economy.   The moves have been followed by a general rise in a variety ofinterest rates. Major banks boosted their prime lending rateone-half percentage point in early May to 9 percent. Mortgagerates, which had dropped to 9.84 percent in February, began risingand now stand at 10.4 percent for fixed-rate loans.   Analysts said rates are likely to head higher for the rest ofthe year, propelled by the tighter-money policy being pursued bythe Fed and by faster-than-expected economic growth.   ``We think that sustained growth through 1989 will keep interestrates on a general uptrend,'' said Roger Brinner, senior economistat Data Resources Inc., of Lexington, Mass.   Analysts said while they expected further credit tightening onthe part of the central bank, it might not come at this week'smeeting. They said there is no pressing need to reassure financialmarkets of the bank's resolve to fight inflation.   Bond markets in the United States have rallied after beingbuffeted by inflation fears a few weeks ago and the dollar has beensurging in value, in part because foreign investors have regainedconfidence in the U.S. economy.   The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product,grew at a brisk 3.6 percent annual rate in the first three monthsof the year, but many analysts believe that growth rate has slowedto a more sustainable 2.5 percent rate in the current April-Junequarter, a pace less likely to raise concerns of overheating.   However, the recent good news is balanced against otherpressures such as the drought in the Midwest which is expected todrive food prices higher.   ``The severe drought conditions can change the whole psychologyof inflation with higher prices at food stores putting pressure onwages as Americans find their purchasing power constrained,'' saidDavid Jones, senior economist at Aubrey G.
