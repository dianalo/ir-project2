We have had planes inthe air. There are very much higher expenses.&quot;;    The proposal &quot;seems like itcan be justified pretty easily,&quot; a House budget aide said. &quot;There's sure to bea lot of sympathy for Israel's position.&quot;;    Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., a newmember of the Appropriations Committee and a strong advocate of Israel, said,&quot;It's premature to talk about it; it isn't a formal request.&quot; Approval &quot;may bevery much affected by what's done in the next few weeks,&quot; he said.;    HouseForeign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said he was notfamiliar with details of the request and was not sure when it would beconsidered.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARTIN MERZER AND PAUL ANDERSON, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910123  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  469  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 23, 199100023210,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
