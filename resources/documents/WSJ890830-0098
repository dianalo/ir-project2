The revised gross national product for the second quarter, which suggested that the economy is more robust than previously indicated, added to the muddle in the OTC market, according to Len Hefter, head of Jefferies andamp; Co.'s OTC desk in Dallas.    The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 466.57, down 0.62. Among bigger stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index of industrial and technology stocks dropped 2.32 to 440.60. The Nasdaq Financial Index eased 0.13 to 462.97.    Mr. Hefter noted that the biggest technology stocks failed to follow up on Monday's gains. Yesterday, MCI Communications, Apple Computer, Intel, Lotus Development and Sun Microsystems all were lower. The group's inability to mount a sustained advance is holding back the overall OTC market, he believes. &quot;They continue to react very badly to news and can't seem to hold together,&quot; Mr. Hefter complained. &quot;They're weak, and the market needs them to provide leadership.&quot;    Many financial stocks, particularly insurance stocks, didn't fare well, either. Mr. Hefter speculated that investors, figuring that a strong economy means interest rates won't fall anytime soon, lost interest in the group yesterday. Those issues tend to perform well during periods of declining interest rates.    The Nasdaq Insurance Index slipped 0.45 to 534.74. The Bank Index declined 0.34 to 489.85; but the Other Finance Index, which includes savings and loan issues, added 0.95 to 553.72. Among insurance stocks, Safeco lost 1/4 to 33 1/8; St. Paul Cos. was off 1/4 to 59 3/4, and Twentieth Century Industries declined 1/8 to 22 1/8. Ohio Casualty was unchanged at 49 1/4. First Executive rose 1/4 to 11 1/2.    Shares of Flight International Group, which has said it might report a loss for its fiscal first quarter, lost 1 3/4 to 5.    Troubled Lone Star Technologies eased 1/8 to 4 3/4 on volume of more than a million shares. The company, which posted a $14.5 million second-quarter loss, recently postponed about $4 million in interest payments on some of its debentures.    LifeCore Biomedical slid 7/8 to 4, in part because Dain Bosworth Inc. cut its rating on the stock to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;accumulate,&quot; Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said.    Oregon Metallurgical added 1/2 to 26 1/4 after Montgomery Securities initiated coverage yesterday with a buy rating, Professional Investor Report said. The company produces titanium alloy used by the aerospace industry.    First Financial Management gained 1 1/4 to 35 3/4. Hambrecht andamp; Quist repeated a longstanding buy recommendation on the Atlanta company, according to Professional Investor Report.    Highflying Summit Technology lost 1/2 to 12 3/4 bid. The laser maker has soared 132% since July 26.    The company, which makes laser devices to help treat severe eye and heart disorders, has projected revenue of $4 million to $4.5 million for 1989, up from $1.1 million in 1988. On Monday it said the Food and Drug Administration has permitted it to begin clinical trials of a device for clearing blocked arteries. Earlier this month, Summit won a patent for its disposable corneal mask used in an experimental laser surgery procedure to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. The company competes with Visx and Taunton Technologies in developing ophthalmological laser surgery procedures.    Visx closed unchanged at 12 bid; Taunton Technologies slipped 1 1/2 to 19 1/2 bid.    Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood analyst Edward Mutsch said it is too early to know where Summit will peak. &quot;If (the vision) treatment lives up to its early promise and if the company is successful in providing this yet-to-be-proven treatment, then the stock could be worth a multiple of its present value three or four years down the line,&quot; he said. &quot;But the stock is going to be volatile until then.&quot; For now, he rates Summit, Visx and Taunton as &quot;speculative buys.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
