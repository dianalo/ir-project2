The mixed-bag bond offering illustrates how creative housing authorities have become in recent years, as they seek to continue providing housing loans to low-income and middle-income residents while sidestepping tightened government policies on the use of tax-exempt bonds.    &quot;This is the most innovative offering we've structured,&quot; said John Eforo, the agency's chief financial officer. &quot;There is something here for everyone.&quot;    The $280 million offering will consist of $55 million of traditional tax-exempt munis, $200 million of bonds subject to the so-called alternative minimum tax and $26 million of fully taxable bonds. The offering is tentatively scheduled for pricing Sept. 12.    Ever since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 limited the use of tax-exempt bonds to &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;public purpose&quot; projects, municipalities have had to scramble to find alternative ways to pay for such projects as airports, convention centers and housing development.    But while the tax-exempt and minimum-tax bonds are expected to go over big with investors, taxable municipals could sit for a while.    &quot;The taxable muni market hasn't really gotten off the ground,&quot; said Bernard Beal, president of M.R. Beal andamp; Co., a New York investment banking firm that specializes in municipal bonds. The taxable municipal market remains small, and the bonds tend to be difficult to trade in the secondary market, he said.    S.E. Canaday Jr., a vice president at John Nuveen andamp; Co., said taxable municipals &quot;are the type of bonds you buy if you expect to hold&quot; until maturity.    Sonyma, as the New York agency is called, uses proceeds from bond sales to provide low-rate mortgages to first-time home buyers. By combining a small taxable issue with a much larger tax-free and minimum-tax issues, the agency is able to raise additional funds to service a larger number of families without exceeding federal limitations.    Sonyma and other housing agencies can no longer raise new money through tax-exempt bonds, but they can recycle old funds, which is being done with the $55 million portion of the offering. They also are offering minimum-tax bonds and throwing in some taxables. By blending the three, the agency can still provide mortgages that have below-market interest rates. For example, yields are currently about 7.50% on new tax-free housing bonds, 7.75% on housing bonds subject to the minimum tax and more than 9.5% on fully taxable bonds.    &quot;When you blend those rates together, we should be able to provide home owners with mortgage loans of about 8.5%,&quot; which is much lower than market rates for conventional fixed-rate mortgages, said Mr. Eforo. According to HSH Associates in Butler, N.J., the average rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage in New York state was 10.04% in early August, and the average was 9.52% nationwide.    While that may be good news for New York home buyers, money managers offer mixed reviews of such offerings.    One attraction in the alternative minimum tax bonds is that their yields tend to be higher than on other muni bonds; that's to compensate investors for the possible tax liability. (The federal alternative minimum tax is aimed at ensuring that wealthy people and companies pay at least some income tax.)    Mr. Canaday estimates that just 2% of the households in the U.S. would be subject to the alternative minimum tax. Also, housing bonds pay higher yields that municipals in general because they have a greater chance of being called before maturity, often because home-buyers sell their homes or refinance mortgages.    Minimum-tax municipals &quot;are great investments as long as you are sure you aren't going to have to pay tax,&quot; said Mr. Canaday. &quot;We hold lots of them in the mutual funds. For traditional municipal bond buyers, it's a great chance to get additional income, and few people have to pay extra tax on them.&quot;    But few money managers see much attraction in taxable municipals. People who regularly buy corporate taxable bonds are unhappy that municipals are called so often, while the typical municipal buyer has a tax-avoidance mentality.    &quot;Taxable municipals have not met with the market very well,&quot; said Bruce Whiteford, a municipal bond portfolio manager at Chase Investors Management Corp. &quot;What I tend to find is that tax exempt people say it's a taxable bond, and taxable people consider it a muni. So it just falls between the cracks.&quot; ---    Friday's Market Activity    U.S. Treasurys ended 1/8 to 3/8 point lower after suddenly switching directions late in the day.    Prices were actually as much as 3/8 higher for most of the day. But a wave of selling that began in the bond futures pit quickly spread to the cash market. Bond traders said the downturn was exaggerated by thin trading.    &quot;Day traders needed to even up their positions,&quot; said a coupon dealer based in Chicago. And when these speculators liquidated their long-term bonds, there were no buyers to help offset the selling, the dealer said.    September bond futures fell 1/4 point to settle at 96 16/32, after trading between 96 14/32 and 97 04/32. Bearish technical factors also contributed to the bond futures selling, dealers said. Sell-stops were triggered after the September contract slipped below 96 24/32, they said.    The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 99 5/32 to yield 8.19%, compared with Thursday's price of 99 19/32 to yield 8.15%.    Some bond analysts contend that Friday's drop doesn't bode well for fixed-income markets. &quot;It has increased the level of caution in the market,&quot; said the Chicago trader.    Among other things, investors are concerned that coming economic data will reinforce perceptions that the economy is headed for a &quot;soft landing,&quot; with moderating growth and easing inflation, rather than a recession.    The most important releases this week are tomorrow's revision of the second-quarter gross national product and Friday's employment report for August.    Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect, on average, an upward revision in the second-quarter annual growth rate to 2.5% from the initially reported 1.7%.    In other major markets:    --Corporate bonds ended 1/4 point lower. Traders said activity centered on recent new issues. Just over $1.1 billion of bonds were priced last week, roughly a third of the previous week's $2.9 billion. Traders said the relatively low supply coupled with a light calendar for this week resulted in spreads tightening slightly. One new issue expected this week is Delta Air Lines, which is expected to offer about $274 million of equipment trust certificates.    --Mortgage securities ended 1/32 to 2/ 32 lower amid talk of sizable thrift selling. Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for September delivery finished at 96 25/32, down 1/32, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities ended at about 95 27/32, off 1/32.    --Municipal bonds were 1/8 point firmer, with market participants facing the prospect of an extremely quiet new issue sector this week.    A number of sizable deals that underwriters have been holding in the wings are now tentatively scheduled for pricing after Labor Day, when the bulk of still-vacationing investors are expected back. </TEXT></DOC>
