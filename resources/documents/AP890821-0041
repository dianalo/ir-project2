At 6 a.m. EDT, Tropical Storm Erin's center was located about1,350 miles southwest of the Azores island chain, near 23.0 northlatitude and 41.8 west longitude.   It would be very unusual for Erin to make landfall in the UnitedStates from its present position, Mayfield said.   The storm packed winds of 45 mph and was moving northwest at 15to 20 mph. Erin's forward motion was expected to slow as its windspeed increases during the next 12 to 24 hours, forecasters said.   Erin became the season's fifth tropical storm late Sunday whenits sustained winds reached 39 mph. Hurricanes have sustained windsof 74 mph or greater. There have been two hurricanes so far thisseason, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
