Kennametal has been under investigation by a jointcongressional subcommittee looking into whether federalfarm-loan guarantees were used to finance Iraqi munitionspurchases. &quot;At the beginning of this investigation,Kennametal denied any involvement with the Iraqi procurementnetwork,&quot; said Rep. Charles Rose (D., N.C.), chairman of thesubcommittee, &quot;but it's clear now that they were very muchinvolved.&quot;   Rep. Rose said he intends to ask the Justice Department toopen a formal inquiry of Kennametal's activities. Mr. Rosecontends that, based on evidence assembled by subcommitteeinvestigators, Kennametal violated not only President Bush'sexecutive order but various federal export laws.   According to intracompany memos and letters betweenKennametal managers and customers, as well as sworn testimonygiven by employees to British investigators, Kennametal hadextensive trading relationships with Iraqi agents.   Federal authorities are investigating a number ofcompanies for their alleged role in helping to build Iraq'swar arsenal. Kennametal is North America's largest producerof tungsten carbide. That material is crucial for cuttinguranium and other heavy metals used to make nuclear andconventional ordnance.   Starting in 1988, the Iraqis were buying $16 million ayear of tungsten carbide cutting bits for use in theirweapons program, according to arms expert Kenneth Timmerman,who has written extensively on the Iraqi arms buildup.   Most of Kennametal's dealings were with an Iraqi frontcompany in Britain, Matrix Churchill Ltd. Matrix's link toIraq was first disclosed in the British press in September1989. British authorities began investigating the companysoon after. In the spring of 1990, Kennametal's outside legalcounsel warned that dealings with Matrix could pose legalproblems, according to various correspondence. In an Aug. 10,1990, memo, a Kennametal manager acknowledged that &quot;MatrixChurchill is an Iraqi-owned business.&quot;   Kennametal Chairman Quentin McKenna, in a news releaselast August, said the company provided no products orservices &quot;of any kind directly or indirectly to Iraq afterAug. 2, 1990.&quot; But in a letter dated Aug. 30, 1991, to K.A.Bailey, chief executive officer of Matrix Churchill, he wrotethat Kennametal had &quot;considered very carefully earlier thisyear&quot; whether to halt business with Matrix Churchill anddecided &quot;some months ago to suspend dealings.&quot; He noted thatKennametal had conducted a &quot;thorough legal analysis&quot; andconcluded that &quot;very strict U.S. regulations require us notto presently trade with Matrix Churchill.&quot;   Kennametal said that Mr. McKenna, in his letter to thechief executive of Matrix Churchill, was simply explaining&quot;the reasons why Kennametal chose to continue not to dobusiness with Matrix Churchill to completely insurecompliance with U.S. law even after the U.K. government hadremoved all restrictions on doing business with Matrix.&quot;   Other documents show that Kennametal had direct dealingswith at least four Iraqi state concerns responsible formunitions projects in that country.   Prior to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, it wasn't illegal tosell military hardware to Iraq. However, U.S. and Britishexport laws required declarations if a company knowinglysupplied munitions-related hardware. Kennametal has contendedthat it was the responsibility of others to make thenecessary declarations, and that it never sold tools for useby Iraqi munitions makers. But some Kennametal managers knewtheir products had been used to make weapons in Iraq.   William Walker, managing director of Kennametal's Britishunit, in a March 26, 1990, memo to Kennametal's generalcounsel David T. Cofer, wrote: &quot;This confirms our telephonediscussion of today . . . that we send a Kennametal employeeto Iraq. . . . We sold the product to a U.K. company whoresold it to the customer in Iraq, who is using the productto manufacture munitions.&quot;   Mr. Walker told the customer that Kennametal wouldn't sendan employee to Iraq &quot;because of the extremely sensitivepolitical situation and the possible restrictions under U.S.and U.K. law.&quot; Mr. Walker is no longer employed by Kennametaland couldn't be reached for comment.   Gordon Mortimer, a Kennametal sales manager in Britain,told outside legal counsel on Nov. 10, 1990, that metal partsKennametal supplied to Matrix Churchill were used to makeIraqi bomb fuses, according to that law firm's meeting notes.Mr. Mortimer also told outside counsel that beginning in1987, Kennametal had &quot;supplied and delivered to Matrix . . .tooling to machine 155mm and 135mm shells,&quot; a contract knownas &quot;the Huteen Project. This was the name of the ordnancefactory out in Iraq.&quot; Mr. Mortimer didn't return phone calls,and the law firm declined comment.   Kennametal continued doing business with Matrix Churchillafter the presidential trade ban took effect-the orderremains in force-and even during the Gulf War. Kennametal'sgeneral counsel Mr. Cofer, in an Aug. 8, 1990, memo,instructed employees that &quot;all relationships betweenKennametal . . . and Iraq will be suspended immediately.&quot; Henoted that the trade ban also applied to &quot;third parties whomyou know or have reason to know will complete the transactionwith an Iraqi entity.&quot;   But in a memo dated Feb. 12, 1991, from Philip Ferraz, aKennametal finance manager in England, to Mr. Mortimer, Mr.Ferraz wrote that he &quot;agreed to accept an order from MatrixChurchill . . . to help (them) through a difficult period.&quot;It's unclear what the order was for.   In another memo dated April 9, 1991, from Mr. Ferraz toMr. Cofer, Mr. Ferraz wrote: &quot;Subsequent to the generalinstruction to cease trading with Iraq, we accepted twoorders from Matrix Churchill for the supply of a toolingpackage and some other miscellaneous products. . . . We alsosupplied product from consignment.&quot; Mr. Ferraz declinedcomment.   Kennametal said the order to which Mr. Ferraz referred wasfor use in the U.K. &quot;There was no connection with Iraq.&quot;   Other documents show Kennametal serviced MatrixChurchill's machines and had an ongoing supply arrangementwith Matrix after President Bush's order took effect. Forinstance, Kennametal requested payment from Matrix 24 timesbetween Aug. 21, 1990, and March 6, 1991, including invoicesfor new orders and consigned stock.   Rep. Rose contends that Kennametal had at least $1 millionin metalworking stock on Matrix Churchill's premises afterthe presidential order banned such supply arrangements.   Kennametal also had ties with Mr. Cardoen, whose companyis suspected of having built munitions factories in Iraq.Matrix Churchill was a subcontractor to Cardoen, and isbelieved by investigators to have supplied machinery to makeartillery-shell fuses.   Although Kennametal apparently supplied goods on theproject directly to Matrix Churchill, company officials knewMr. Cardoen was involved, various documents show. In sworntestimony to British customs authorities, a Kennametalproject manager, David Leslie Bardsley, said: &quot;I knew Cardoenwas involved because that name appeared on documents providedto me. . . . I knew Iraq was the final destination . . . .&quot;Mr. Bardsley didn't return phone calls.   Kennametal said it isn't &quot;aware that any Kennametalemployee has provided testimony to British customsauthorities.&quot; It added that &quot;we have no information to dateabout whether the products which we lawfully sold to MatrixChurchill in the U.K. were somehow used by Matrix in aproject with Carlos Cardoen.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
