Mr. Epp previously has said the government might reviewthe ownership rules, but this was the first time he hasconfirmed that the review has reached the cabinet level.</LP><TEXT>   The change in rules would be intended to provide newcapital for the oil industry, which is currently squeezed bylow oil and gas prices.   The Canadian Petroleum Association, which represents oiland gas producers, said relaxing the restrictions would helpfund-raising by the industry. But some industry sources saidthe changes are likely to do little for oil companies in thenear term.   Under current rules, foreigners are prohibited fromacquiring financially healthy, Canadian-controlled oilcompanies valued at more than 5 million Canadian dollars(US$4.5 million). The rule doesn't apply to financiallytroubled concerns.   Mr. Epp said the financial-distress requirement &quot;devaluesa company&quot; that is up for sale and hurts the oil industry. Hewouldn't disclose what specific changes the government isconsidering, but said he didn't rule out two options thathave been discussed within the industry.   One option would be to raise the C$5 million level toC$150 million. Another would be to permit foreign acquisitionof an oil company if regulators find the transaction to be of&quot;net benefit&quot; to Canada.   The current restrictions were designed to boost Canadianownership in the oil industry to at least 50%. It iscurrently about 46%.   &quot;Any restrictions put on raising capital just makes ourlife tougher,&quot; said Lorne Gordon, chairman of the CanadianPetroleum Association. He said drilling activity is at a lowlevel and is expected to decline further.   But some industry sources said the changes would do littleto help companies attract capital. &quot;Why would foreigners wantto invest in an industry that is showing less than a 5% rateof return?&quot; said Ian Doig, editor of Doig's Digest, anindustry newsletter.   The Canadian oil industry currently has about $4.1 billionCanadian dollars (US$3.65 billion) of properties andcompanies up for sale. &quot;It's certainly a buyers' market,&quot;said Frank Sayer, president of Sayer Securities Ltd.,Calgary, Alberta. But relaxing foreign ownership ruleswouldn't necessarily bid up the value of the properties, hesaid. &quot;One has to ask why a foreigner would pay more thanwhat the existing marketplace in Canada is paying for thoseassets today.&quot;   Mr. Doig said the expected government change indicatesthat it will approve the proposed sale by Nova Corp. ofAlberta of its 43% share in Husky Oil Ltd. to Hong Kongfinancier Li Ka-shing. The government is expected to rule onthe proposed sale later this month.   Mr. Epp, the energy minister, said that under the currentownership rules, the investment needed to develop theindustry's potential wasn't occurring.</TEXT></DOC>
