Manuel Noriega says it failedbecause her husband was betrayed by another major who switchedsides at the last minute, according to a published report.   Countering what U.S. officials have been saying, Adela Bonillade Giroldi is quoted by the New York Times in its Thursday editionsas saying that the coup was ``very well organized and coldlycalculated.''   She said her husband, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, had worked withMaj. Francisco Olechea, commander of the elite Battalion 2000, inplanning the coup.   Instead of being used to oust Noriega, however, Battalion 2000was airlifted 55 miles from the scene of the fighting and ledNoriega's troops in crushing the coup.   ``Everything was ready. But Olechea was playing a winner's gameand he failed to come through because of his cowardice. Hecommitted treason,'' she told the Times in an interview conductedin Miami.   In a television interview with WTVJ of Miami, she said shewarned her husband of the perils of the attempted coup.   ``I told him `Think of what you're doing.' I said, `If you'regoing to do that, you're going to have to kill him.'   ``He said, `I don't think that will be necessary. If things getdifficult, we'll give him over to the Americans. If not, we'llretire him under house arrest,''' she said.   She says her husband had wanted help from the Americans, butmilitary bureaucracy may have prevented that help from arriving intime, she told the station. She said the battle with Noriega willcontinue, and her husband's death could be a catalyst.   ``Where (Giroldi) is now, he is OK,'' she told WTVJ. ``He's withGod. Noriega, not even hell wants him. Panama doesn't want him.Hell doesn't want him. So, where will he go?''   Mrs. Giroldi, airlifted from Panama, is staying with herchildren and invalid mother at a secret location in Miami.   She was not at military headquarters during the coup attempt onOct. 3 and her information came from officers who took part in thecoup and fled to the United States, the Times said.   She said she believed the coup would have succeeded had it notbeen for Olechea, whose battalion would have provided the firepowerto topple Noriega, she told the newspaper.   Olechea ``turned sides at the last moment'' although Olechea andher husband ``were good friends and had talked several times aboutthis coup'' she said.   She also said that three captains who were supposed to persuadeNoriega to surrender ``didn't do it because they were cowards.''   Her lends credence to reports that officers held Noriega for upto five hours as they argued whether to turn him over to U.S.officials.   While the captains argued, Noriega slipped into a separate roomand telephoned for help and the coup was crushed.   Mrs. Giroldi said that Noriega ``himself assassinated myhusband.''   ``My husband could have killed Noriega, but he would not dothat. He thought the commander's fate should be decided by thepeople,'' not the United States, she told the paper.   Mrs. Giroldi did not have firsthand evidence that Noriega killedher husband, the paper said.   She confirmed that she had approached U.S. officials and toldthem that a coup attempt was imminent and that the sealing of roadsby U.S. forces would help her husband's attempt.   She told the Times that the coup attempt was hatched by juniorofficers who were fed up with Noriega, who she said ``always seemeddrunk.''   ``My husband told me that most of the time Noriega was operativeonly an hour a day,'' she said, adding that it was widely believedthat Noriega drank heavily and used amphetamines.   Noriega is very bright, she told the Times.   ``The next time, he has to be the first to be killed,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
