These devices combined 10 to 12 pulsedGaAlAs injection lasers into a compact package using fiber-optic couplingto achieve a high radiance. The delivered devices had a nominal peakpower of 100 watts in a 40-ns pulse at a repetition rate up to 50 kHz.The emitting aperture was 0.010 inch square. The devices were designedto be driven by a Power Technology model ILM pulser.</TEXT></DOC>
