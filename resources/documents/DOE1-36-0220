When interpreted in terms of ejection, the Mg II absorptionsystems are randomly distributed in velocity relative to the QSOs, althoughthe systems may cluster on scales of a few thousand km/s. This is consistentwith the absorption systems arising in intervening material not associatedwith the QSOs. The equivalent width distribution of the Mg II systemsis well fitted by either an exponential or a power-law distribution,with the number density of the absorption systems increasing with decreasingrest equivalent width. There is marginally significant evidence for cosmologicalevolution of the number density of the Mg II absorbers, and no evidencefor evolution of the Mg II equivalent width distribution with redshift.42 references.</TEXT></DOC>
