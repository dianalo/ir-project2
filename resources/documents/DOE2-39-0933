<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0933 </DOCNO><TEXT>New microalloyed pearlitic steels with lower carbon content and highersilicon and manganese contents, which feature both high strength andgood toughness properties after forging and subsequent controlled cooling,have been developed on the basis of steel grade 49 MnVS 3. These newsteel grades are designated 38 MnSiVS 5 and 27 MnSIVS 6. The grain-growthinhibiting effect of different microalloy additions has been investigatedin order to achieve additionally also a good stability of the fine-grainedstructure. Vanadium and titanium microalloyed steels feature the desiredfine-grain stability, however, also slightly lower strength properties.</TEXT></DOC>
