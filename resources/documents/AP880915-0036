(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mary Mills mailed in a cashier's checkto pay an $85 speeding ticket, but it was made out for a tad toomuch.   Like $1,000,085.   When the Morristown woman bought the check from the ThirdNational Bank of Morristown, she apparently didn't notice that itread ``1000085 and 00 cents.''   ``I called the bank and asked them if they wanted me to sendthat check back to them,'' Putnam County Circuit Court Clerk LewisCoomer said Tuesday. ``And the woman I talked to said yes theycertainly did. And she also said, `And if you decide you're goingout of town, stop and get us.'''</TEXT><DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Steak and potatoes is one of America'smost popular meals, but you wouldn't think so from the recipes ofthe 62 top cooks in the 15th-annual National Beef Cookoff.   ``No one is using potatoes, which is strange because meat andpotatoes are supposed to go together,'' said Sarah Lynn Quinn, whois in charge of obtaining ingredients for next week's contest.   ``We're buying plenty of tomatoes, though, and alfalfa sprouts,dill pickles, avocados and every kind of lettuce you can imagine,''she said Wednesday. ``We're buying about 10 to 15 pounds ofonions.''   The contest runs Monday through Thursday, and the public isinvited to watch the cooks in action Thursday. A $5,000 award willgo to the first-place winner in each of three categories _conventional, barbecue and microwave _ with a $10,000 bonus for thebest overall recipe.   Last year's overall winner was Patricia Yee of California, whowon for her warm beef and black-eye pea salad.   The contest is sponsored by several beef industry groups topromote the use of beef.   Quinn said she has been kept busy chasing down sometimesfrustrating ingredient demands by the competitors.   ``One contestant wants orange chrysanthemums,'' she said. ``Wethought it was a flower. We found every color, but we couldn't findorange ones. It turns out it's a garnish you make out of an orange.We had the grocery store man looking everywhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
