Under some conditions, unrepaireddimers are known to be lethal, but the extent of their involvement inmutagenesis is less clear. A fraction of UV mutagenesis (sometimes verylarge) is nontargeted, occurring as a consequence of damage to host DNAbut leading to mutational changes at undamaged sites. Thus, while cyclobutylpyrmidine dimers may be primarily responsible for inducing the SOS systemand for promoting an environment leading to nontargeted mutagenesis,other lesions may serve as sites where mutations are produced in theDNA. The author has been exploring mechanisms of targeted and nontargetedUV mutagenesis, mainly by studying base sequence changes in the cI geneof bacteriophage lambda. The results, are summarized here, and are relatedto other studies.</TEXT></DOC>
