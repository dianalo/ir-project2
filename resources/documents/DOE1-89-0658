However when minimum base production is covered only bynuclear plants and is greater then minimum load demand, some sort ofoptimal modulation of these plants must be taken into account. The programdeveloped deals with this constraint in a quasi-optimal way, and allowsalso energy exchanges based on short term contracts. The effectivenessof the proposed algorithm has been verified at the Belgian utility wherethis program was developed.</TEXT></DOC>
