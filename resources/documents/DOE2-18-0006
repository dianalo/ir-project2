<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-0006 </DOCNO><TEXT>In this paper it is shown how the results of short-term constant strainratetests can be used to predict deformation and rupture under long termcreep conditions. Such tests have been performed on a candidate material({alpha} Ni-Cr-Co-Mo superalloy) for the high temperature reactor inthe temperature range 800-900/sup 0/C. Creep curve, isochronous stress-straincurve and rupture life extrapolations are presented in the temperaturerange 800-1050/sup 0/C. These extrapolations all agree favourably withpublished data.
