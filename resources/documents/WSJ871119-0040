The negotiators yesterday moved closer to an agreement on the broad outlines of a package that would reduce this fiscal year's projected deficit by what some negotiators claim is $30.2 billion. The savings in the next fiscal year are expected to be in the range of $45 billion.    The package isn't yet final and the president hasn't declared his position on it. But White House officials said last night that the president still would prefer an agreement to the automatic budget cuts of Gramm-Rudman.    In a speech today to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, President Reagan is expected to urge the negotiators to go forward and complete action and to recognize that neither side will get everything it wants, White House officials said. His chief negotiators are expected to meet this morning with House Republicans to discuss their concerns.    House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) acknowledged that a measure of Republican support would be necessary to pass the deficit-reduction package in the Democratic-controlled House.    Meanwhile, negotiations are likely to continue today to find as much as $1 billion in additional savings and forestall the chance that the plan might not be adequate to avert the automatic cuts scheduled to go into effect tomorrow. Congressional leaders hope to wrap up the plan today and move to postpone the automatic cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.    Even if negotiators settle on a package this week, legislators would have to vote to postpone the Gramm-Rudman cuts in order to give Congress time to implement it.    The negotiators yesterday discussed ways to ensure that the savings in the package will be implemented, a major concern among Republicans because the agreement wouldn't be binding on various appropriations and tax writing committees. Also undecided is whether the package will include not only the tax increases under discussion but measures already in House and Senate tax bills that would result in lowered revenues.    Throughout the day, Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate complained about what they declared to be a dearth of nonmilitary cuts in the package. Many said they would be loath to support either the package in legislated form or a vote to postpone the $23 billion in automatic cuts.    This was the message taken to the White House by Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) and his House counterpart, Robert Michel of Illinois, according to Mr. Michel. A spokesman for Sen. Dole said he didn't know any details about the meeting.    &quot;Both Bob Dole and I wanted the president to know about our membership, what strong feeling they have with respect to what form the package is taking,&quot; Mr. Michel said in an interview. &quot;Under the circumstances, there are an overwhelming number of our members who would say, 'If we can't do better than that, let's just go to sequestration,'&quot; the technical term for the across-the-board cuts under Gramm-Rudman.    &quot;If there's to be an agreement,&quot; Mr. Michel added, it's &quot;got to have the support of a good measure of Republicans or it isn't an agreement. How could you have the (Republican) president on point for a package that is supported only by the (chambers') Democratic majorities?&quot;    Mr. Michel said that neither he nor Sen. Dole recommended that the president reject the plan that is taking shape. They made clear, however, that their members would prefer to have more nonmilitary spending cuts. Mr. Michel also said that some of his members would have trouble supporting the tax increase now in the package.    According to Mr. Michel, the president asked whether the Republicans really preferred the deep cuts in military spending that the Gramm-Rudman law would impose, compared with the less onerous cuts under the impending compromise. Mr. Michel said he made the point that his members feel strongly that at least the Gramm-Rudman law produces what they consider real spending reductions in other areas.    The proposed compromise would increase taxes by $9 billion and reduce military spending by $4.9 billion, compared with projected levels in the current fiscal year. Nonmilitary spending would be reduced by $2.6 billion, and entitlement programs, which provide benefits under requirements established by law, would be trimmed by nearly $4 billion.    The automatic Gramm-Rudman cuts would crop $23 billion out of the budget, half from military programs and half from nonmilitary programs. A large portion of the budget would be left unscathed, however, including a variety of poverty programs and Social Security.    Republican lawmakers asserted that, in the package now under debate, savings on nonmilitary and entitlement programs were too small or largely illusory. &quot;We get taxes but no substantial cuts,&quot; said Rep. Lynn Martin (R., Ill.). Added Rep. Guy Vander Jagt (R., Mich.), &quot;It stinks. It's business as usual: smoke and mirrors.&quot;    &quot;We had a chance for beefsteak,&quot; said Sen. Robert Packwood (R., Ore.), &quot;and we ended up with gruel.&quot;    &quot;Gruel is better than no food at all,&quot; responded House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.). The Gramm-Rudman cuts, he added, &quot;would be a starvation diet.&quot;    Some negotiators were still fishing for more budget savings in the fear that a close accounting of the package could reveal it is short of the minimum deficit-reduction required to avert the Gramm-Rudman cuts, approximately $24.8 billion. &quot;We've got to get it right,&quot; said Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.), a congressional negotiator.    ---   Ellen Hume contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
