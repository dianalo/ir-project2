Saying the United States remains too heavily dependent onforeign oil more than 15 years after the energy shortage thatproduced long gas lines in 1974, Bush told a joint session of theTexas Legislature: ``We need a national energy policy that reliesnot only on oil, but on many other sources.''   Bush, who set himself up in the Texas oil business in the late1940s and became a millionaire before entering public life, said inhis prepared remarks, ``I know there are still a few dark cloudsremaining on our economic horizon.''   But he said Texas is showing signs of recovering from thebusiness slump brought about by the decline of the energy industryin recent years, and this has happened because an increasinglydiversified economy has brought tens of thousands of high-tech jobsto the state.   ``Still, no matter how diversified and high-tech Texas hasbecome, a strong domestic energy industry is important to thefuture of this state and all of America,'' Bush said. ``I find itdisturbing that nearly 50 percent of America's oil is imported.This is not good for our national security.''   Maximizing use of oil resources will make the country lessdependent on imported fuel, he said, and increasing reliance onalternative energy resources will give the country a cleanerenvironment.   The president reiterated that the nation must not retreat fromoil exploration because of the huge spill from the tanker ExxonValdez off the coast of Alaska.   ``We are using federal resources intelligently in the cleanupeffort,'' he said. ``We are working with industry to develop animproved plan in the event of a future spill.''   ``But shutting down our domestic energy production is no answer,and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil,'' Bushsaid. ``To reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we must return tohigh levels of exploratory drilling.''   He said he intends to stimulate domestic oil drilling ``with taxcredits and other incentives.''   Bush did not cite those incentives. But during his campaign forthe presidency, he suggested a 10 percent tax credit for oil andgas exploration up to $10 million of costs and 5 percent above that.   He also proposed eliminating 80 percent of intangible drillingcosts as subject to the alternative minimum tax for independentproducers.   In his speech today, Bush called on Congress ``at long last, tofully decontrol natural gas. I believe that this will happen soon.''   He said he believes the nation ``can and must use more safenuclear power'' and said that ``coal has a bright future.''   ``As we all become increasingly concerned about the need forclean air, we must look more to natural gas and to nuclear power,''he said. ``We must produce more of our corn crop to produceethanol, more of our natural gas to produce methanol.''   ``Greater use of these two will rapidly improve the air qualityof our most heavily populated cities,'' the president said.</TEXT></DOC>
