<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-20-0194 </DOCNO><TEXT>Vapour absorption cooling systems, powered by solar thermal energy, arenow commercially manufactured in sizes ranging from 1.5 to over 20 RT.The needed thermal energy at appropriate temperature potential can eitherbe provided by solar thermal collectors or else from a solar pond. Theassessment criteria and results for technical and economic evaluationof the performance of absorption chiller using a solar pond are presented.The results, based on Kuwait's environmental data and costs, have beencompared with three alternate cooling sytems namely solar thermal collectorabsorption cooling system, solar photovoltaic cooling system, and standardvapour compression cooling system. The criteria, used for performanceevaluation of the solar cooling systems on a technical basis, consistsof assessing the extent to which such systems can make a positive contributionin a conserving fossil fuel.</TEXT></DOC>
