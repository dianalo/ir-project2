Members of the ruling Arab BaathSocialist Party exhorted them through loudspeakers.   ``We will never forget U.S. evil,'' read one banner. ``No tointervention in our affairs,'' read another in both Arabic andEnglish.   ``Down with the U.S. Knesset,'' said another banner, referringto close U.S. ties with Israel, whose parliament is called theKnesset.   About 20,000 marchers filed past the embassy for two hours.   The crowd was orderly, even cheerful, and there was no apparentthreat to the embassy. One ranking U.S. diplomat stood on thesidewalk a few feet from the march and watched it move by.   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in a statement Sunday thatthe U.S. Senate ``aims to divert the attention of the internationalmedia from the uprising in the occupied territories.''   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip have been riotingagainst Israel's military occupation for the past nine months.   Saddam said the fighting with the Kurdish ``insurgents'' lastedat most two days and no serious battles were involved. Hereiterated the charge that the tens of thousand of Kurds who fledacross the Iraqi border to Turkey and Iran were forced by Kurdishrebels, who were seeking publicity for their cause.   Kurdish rebels said that as many as 60,000 Iraqi troops attackedtheir positions in the northern mountains after the Aug. 20cease-fire with Iran in the eight-year gulf war. The rebels of theKurdish Democratic Party said 2,000 Kurdish civilians were killedand 5,000 wounded, many in chemical weapon attacks.   The U.S. Senate voted Friday to demand economic sanctionsagainst Iraq after Secretary of State George Shultz declared thatIraq used chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925 Geneva treaty,against its northern Kurdish population.   The measure, still before the House, would have to be signed byPresident Reagan before taking effect. It was designed to make itdifficult for Iraq to obtain international credit to pay off itsestimated $60 billion war debt.   Well before the latest Iraqi assault on the Kurds, a number ofUnited Nations investigations concluded that Iraq _ and to a lesserextent, Iran _ had engaged in chemical warfare since 1984.   ``Let the American Knesset and its masters understand that Iraqis not a country that can be subject to threats. Iraq, which seekssincere and honorable relations with all, is ready to spit on allinsincere approaches,'' said an editorial in Al-Thawra, urgingIraqis to take to the streets.   It was not signed, but it carried the tag line often used byPresident Saddam Hussein himself: ``To hell with the villains.''   The army newspaper Al-Qadissiyeh denounced the Senate vote withbanner headlines.   The attacks were the strongest on the United States since thetwo countries restored relations in 1984. They were severed afterthe United States supported Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.   Hussein also said Sunday he turned down an offer by unidentifiedpeople in Washington to trade 100 U.S.-made artillery pieces for anadvanced Soviet tank Iraq had during the war.   In a speech broadcast on state-run television, the president didnot specify who offered the 175mm guns for the T-72 tank but saidhis intelligence chief conducted negotiations for them inWashington. He hinted the talks took place in 1982 after somecountries banned arms sales to Iraq.   The United States banned arms sales to both sides during thewar, although administration officials violated that policy byselling arms to Iran in an effort to improve relations and freeAmerican hostages held in Lebanon.   In a related development, the Iraqi News Agency reported that11,517 Kurds accepted the Iraqi government's offer of amnesty forsupporting Iran in the Persian Gulf war and any other actionsagainst the government.   The report, quoting unidentified officials, said Kurds were``pouring through the gates of the borders.''   Newspapers in neighboring Kuwait also attacked the Senate vote.Editorials in pro-government papers said the U.S. campaign wasinspired by the ``Zionist lobby'' in the United States.   The Kuwaiti papers said Arab states could replace any fundingdenied through international institutions because of a U.S. veto.</TEXT></DOC>
