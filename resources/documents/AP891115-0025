On his visit to Washington, he kept tossing bouquets. He threw abear hug around a beaming ``Brother Kirkland'' _ Lane Kirkland,president of the AFL-CIO _ Tuesday and thanked America forreceiving him.   He sounded like a happy tourist.   ``It seems to me that no country has so many trees in thestreets,'' he marveled.   This shipyard electrician from Gdansk went before the laborfederation to revel in ``the bond of friendship between Solidarityand the AFL-CIO'' which had been ``shaped over the years, both goodand bad.''   During Walesa's nine-year ordeal, which has resulted in anon-communist government peacefully taking power in Warsaw,Kirkland arranged quietly to provide about $5 million in help.   The AFL-CIO sent into Poland the printing presses Solidarityneeded to circulate its message. When the authorities discovered apress and seized it, another would be delivered in the night.   In repayment, Walesa gave Washington a piece of the action, ahero to cheer, while history unfolds in Eastern Europe.   Official Washington is officially cautious about events in theSoviet bloc, but even President Bush could set aside prudenceMonday night and welcome a teary Walesa as ``the spiritualgodfather of a new generation.''   To address his colleagues in the labor movement, Walesa stuck aunion button in his lapel. When he arrived, the labor leaders stoodand cheered him for 15 minutes.   He even brought a historic fact: the ``first strike in Americanhistory, in the Jamestown colony,'' in 1619, was staged by Poles.   ``Some of my countrymen _ glassworkers,'' he said, recallingthat bit of labor history, ``lit a flame of freedom and humandignity that is burning to this day at home, in Poland, and here inthe United States.''   Organized labor here has had its own bad years recently.Membership growth is stagnant. Fewer than one worker in six isunionized. The strike against Eastern Airlines has been costly andineffective. Praise from an international hero could hardly havebeen more welcome.   At a news conference, Walesa, his words translated sentence bysentence, pleaded for more help for a Poland that he said isdesperate and ripe for investment.   Two-thirds of its apartment houses, he said, are slums and itsautomobiles are antiques that pollute and ``gulp gasoline likemonsters.''   ``Our children and grandchildren will laugh at us because we hadpoverty, but tanks and missiles _ those were plentiful.''   If American banks were willing to make loans when it was run bythe communists, he said, they should be willing to help now.   ``In Eastern Europe, everything is in short supply, even, orrather first and foremost, time,'' he said. ``No one knows how muchtime we have left to reform our economy, but we all feel it is notmuch. If we fail to convince people that although things arechanging perhaps too slowly they are nevertheless changing for thebetter, then this breeze of freedom I spoke of will soon disappear,leaving behind only a sense of bitterness accompanyingunaccomplished dreams.   ``It will result in a defeat for us, but not only for us.''   When he finished speaking, the union chiefs in his audience _leaders of the garment workers, the carpenters, the Teamsters, themusicians, the schoolteachers _ linked arms and serenaded him withan old union song whose title took on a new twist, ``SolidarityForever.''</TEXT></DOC>
