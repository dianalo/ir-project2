Industrial production rose 0.4%, the eighth consecutive increase, while retail sales jumped 0.9%, the biggest gain since last March. Both reports showed particular strength in the auto industry.    U.S. car sales rebounded in early November from a mild slump the month before. The results were in line with analysts' expectations.    ---   Nicholas Brady was asked by Bush to remain as Treasury secretary. The president-elect also indicated that Brady, a former senator and investment banker, will play a key role in budget talks with Congress.    ---   Emerson Electric and Teledyne units have been notified that they face criminal charges stemming from the Pentagon procurement fraud investigation, according to sources.    ---   Drexel Burnham lost a bid to disqualify Judge Milton Pollack from presiding over the SEC's civil fraud case against the securities firm and others. Drexel plans to appeal.    ---   Two corporate bond issues plan to carry a super &quot;poison put,&quot; allowing holders to recoup their initial investment in the event of a takeover. The issues may be the first of many aimed at curbing highly leveraged deals.    ---   Most markets were subdued as investors awaited today's U.S. trade report, which is expected to show a narrower deficit for September.    Foreign investors are continuing to shun U.S. stocks because of worries about the weakening dollar.    ---   Airfares for vacation travelers are going up again. The increase is being led by Continental Air, which yesterday boosted many of its lowest fares in a broad rate restructuring.    ---   Reagan's last budget will ignore many Bush campaign pledges by proposing a rise in defense spending and deep cuts in domestic programs.    ---   The SEC is investigating a possible insider-trading scheme involving Penn graduates who work on Wall Street.
