But it was soon upstaged by the integrated circuit and has played second fiddle ever since. Now GTE Corp. scientists are attempting to put the pizazz back into transistors with a novel way of &quot;growing&quot; the electronic devices.    Today's costly, fault-prone transistor-making involves many steps and must be done in sanitized &quot;clean rooms.&quot; But GTE researcher Brian M. Ditchek has a recipe for transistors in which a molten mix of silicon and metal is poured into a heated jug. As it cools, the base material of a transistor forms. It costs less, doesn't need a clean-room setting, and produces more powerful devices.    &quot;We let nature do it,&quot; says Mr. Ditchek, who began work on the idea six years ago at GTE Laboratories in Waltham, Mass.    A transistor is a holding pen for electrical current. It has a power source, a gate that blocks current or lets it pass, and a &quot;drain&quot; that routes the current to the next destination. It starts with a silvery sliver of silicon; the three main parts are added later by a lithographic process. The GTE process cuts production steps by having the gate form itself as the silicon is made.    THE TRADITIONAL METHOD requires costly gear and many steps because silicon is so delicate. At the molecular level, its &quot;single-crystal&quot; structure provides a perfect symmetrical pathway for electrical current. It was always believed that extra parts could be added only after silicon was formed; to mix in alien matter too soon would ruin the symmetry and disrupt the flow of current.    Even then, the transistor can use only a thin layer atop the silicon instead of the entire sliver itself as the pathway for the current. That limits how much power it can handle. But in 1981, research in &quot;eutectics&quot; -- materials that won't mix as solids but merge when melted and then split when cooled -- showed promise for spicing silicon with other substances.    Mr. Ditchek tried dozens of experiments with various substances. The answer was a dash of tantalum -- 2% of the silicon mix's volume and 5.5% of its weight. The molten mixture is poured into a heated quartz crucible and is slowly rotated. A small probe with a quarter-inch wafer of solid silicon on the tip is dipped into the mix, then pulled out slowly. Surprisingly, the molten silicon begins to separate from the tantalum and attach to the wafer. The tantalum, too, re-forms and links onto the wafer, lining up in the silicon in tiny vertical rods -- 10 million in a square inch.    The probe emerges from the jug with an elongated growth like a candle. The millions of tiny rods running through this silicon shape are the big breakthrough -- they form the gates that are normally added later. The material is chopped to form circular silicon slices, each with millions of tiny rods running through the entire slice to form the gate. This means they can control current throughout the slice instead of just on the surface; therefore the transistor handles more power.    Mr. Ditchek sees the new material being used in motors, big switches, power sources, and especially in fiber-optic communications. But he concedes that will take time; the technique is still something of a mystery. If, for example, the mixture is a tenth of a percent off, it won't work. For now, he says, &quot;you just have to put it in your pot and pull it out and see what's happened.&quot;    ---   Next, a More Sensitive Breed of Robots    Robots have replaced many workers on assembly lines, but humans still have at least one big edge: the ability to perform many tasks at once. Robots can't distinguish between different-sized objects and thus are &quot;much less useful than people thought,&quot; says David Penning, director of manufacturing automation at Dataquest Inc., a research and consulting concern.    Researchers at the Georgia Tech Research Institute hope to change that by using skinlike pads that would allow robots to identify many objects. &quot;It will give the robot the sensing capability of human fingers,&quot; says Jan Gooch, a project director at the school. &quot;What we're trying to do is give the robot a three-dimensional sensing capability with material that's very similar to human flesh. Industrial robots only sense at one point -- they only know whether there's pressure or not.&quot;    The Georgia Tech researchers, who expect to have a prototype system ready by next winter, have developed skinlike, polysilicone gripping pads. These pads, for an assembly robot, are flexible and sensitive enough to wrap tightly around an object and identify it. &quot;It will conform around an object much like a finger conforms around a pencil,&quot; says Mr. Gooch.    Inside the pad, sensors pick up the pressure points when the robot grips the object and electronic signals are transmitted to a computer in the form of three-dimensional patterns. Once the computer recognizes the pattern, it instructs the robot to do a specific task. For example: Computer circuit boards have many different-sized parts. A robot typically takes the same object and inserts it into the circuit board, which then moves to the next assembly area for another part. If the Georgia Tech project is successful, robots could recognize different components and assemble a larger portion of the board at a single workstation. &quot;It would feel the part and know where to put it,&quot; says Mr. Gooch.    -- Hank Gilman</TEXT></DOC>
