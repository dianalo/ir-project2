In contrast Cu and Mo haveno apparent effect on the stability of the amorphous layer. The mechanismsleading to premature crystallization are not well understood. AmorphousW/sub .72/Si/sub .28/ was deposited by D.C. sputtering onto single crystalSi substrates. Overlayers of Al were then evaporated onto the W-Si. UsingAuger electron spectroscopy depth profiling coupled with cross-sectionTEM, the authors studies interfacial reactions between the amorphouslayer and polycrystalling Al. Auger profiling results show that in thecase of Al overlayers, W and Si diffuse out of a a-(W-Si) into the Alwhere WAl/sub 12/ forms. These results can be explained in the contextof three binary diffusion couples, W-Si, W-Al, Al-Si, and the individualinteractions associated with these couples.</TEXT></DOC>
