(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Barnes, David.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>CLIPPER STILL THRIVINGandM;This is in response to your Market Monitor article on the RISC microprocessormarket (&quot;Three Dominant RISC Architectures Foreseen,&quot; March 27, page 58.)andM;The fact that Integraph has next-generation Clipper Chips well under way inboth CMOS and ECL--the latter of which will deliver on the order of 60 MIPSof performance--places the Clipper architecture at the leading edge of RISCevolution, not at the back, as is the opinion of some who were quoted in thearticle.andP;  And the binary compatibility that Clipper offers permits it toaddress applications from low-end desktop machines to high-end computernodes, all running the identical software.andP;  This is an advantage few othervendors can now claim.andM;The Clipper arch itects--most notably Howard Sachs, vice president andgeneral manager of Intergraph's Advanced Processor Division--predicted theRISC technology trends some two years before the competition.andP;  We are nowseeing the adoption of many Clipper-like features by other RISC competitors:dual-bus architecture, combination cache and memory management peripheralchips, RISC processors available in both chip and module from factor,hardwired scoreboarding, etc.andP;  We called the first phase of the RISCrevolution correctly, and we believe we will be on target for phase two aswell--the emergence of the near-supercomputer-performance ECL engines.andM;Finally, nothing is more certain than change, and this is perhaps no moreevident than in the microprocessor marketplace.andP;  In 1985, just before theRISC revolution, we were told by a number of industry observers that therewas no need for another 32-bit chip; Intel and Motorola had it all sewn up.andO;Four years later, we've seen the lead change hands many times, with each newprocessor sending competitors, editors and analysts scurrying to make senseof it.andP;  Despite continual predictions of a shakeout, a variety of RISCarchitectures, including Clipper, continue to evolve and thrive.andP;  DavidBarnes Manager, Marketing Communications Intergraph Palo Alto, Calif.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
