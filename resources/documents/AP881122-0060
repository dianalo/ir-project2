The 1.8 percent gain in apparel costs was accompanied by amoderation in price gains for food, which had posted steep,drought-related increases over the summer.   The jump in clothing prices was virtually as steep as the 2.0percent increase posted in September. Over the last three months,apparel costs have replaced hospital costs and food prices as thegreatest stimulant of inflation, the Labor Department said inreleasing today's report.   The 0.4 overall October increase would amount to an annualinflation rate of 5.1 percent if it persisted for 12 months. Theannualized rate had declined to 4.1 percent in September on a largedrop in gasoline costs.   Gasoline prices fell an additional 1.0 percent in Octoberfollowing a 1.7 percent drop in the preceding month. But thedecrease was not big enough to offset a 1.4 percent increase inelectricity and natural gas costs, which raised consumer energyprices for the month by 0.1 percent.   Food prices rose just 0.2 percent, one-fourth the 0.8 percentjump of September, on large decreases in prices for fruits andvegetables, poultry and pork.   Fruit and vegetable prices actually fell 1.1 percent in Octoberafter rising a total of 12.9 percent the preceding three monthsbecause of drought-related shortages. Prices for beef, pork andpoultry last month fell 0.3 percent, 0.8 percent and 3.0 percent,respectively.   Offsetting those lower prices was the biggest monthly priceincrease for dairy products since December 1980 _ 0.9 percent.Cereal and bakery products costs rose 0.7 percent.   Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.5 percent for the month,more than half of which was due to sharp increases in clothingprices and automobile insurance and finance charges, the LaborDepartment said.   The apparel cost gains reflected the introduction ofhigher-priced fall and winter fashions, particularly for women's andgirls' clothing, which rose 2.5 percent after a 3.5 percent increasein September.   Shoe prices also rose 2.5 percent following a 3.5 percentincrease the previous month.   Automobile insurance and finance charges rose 1.4 percent and 3.4percent respectively. New car prices, seasonally adjusted, were upjust 0.2 percent with prices for 1989 models reflecting a littleover one-fourth of the new car prices surveyed in October. The1989-model prices will continue to be phased in over the nextseveral months as they replace 1988 models in dealer showrooms.   Medical care costs rose 0.5 percent, halfway between therespective 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent increases in August andSeptember.   In the last year, medical costs have risen a total of 6.7percent, compared with increases of 5.2 percent for food, 3.8percent for housing and 4.6 percent for clothing.   The October increases raised the department's Consumer PriceIndex to 120.2. That mean's a basket of goods costing $100 onaverage from 1982 through 1984 would have cost $120.20 last month,up 40 cents from September and compared with a cost of $115.30 ayear ago.   So far this year, consumer price inflation has been running at anannual rate of 4.6 percent, just a fraction ahead of the 4.4 percentannual rate in 1987.   But there is no doubt that inflation has been accelerating. Inthe first three months of 1987, the annual inflation rate was 4.2percent. That annualized rate rose to 4.5 percent in the secondquarter and 4.8 percent in the third.   The Reagan administration in August had forecast that consumerprice inflation would slow to 4.2 percent for all of 1988 and to 3.9percent in 1989.   The 23 percent drop in crude oil prices over the last year hasbeen the biggest damper on inflation, partially offsetting increasesof 5.2 percent for food and 6.6 percent for medical care.   The respite from large food price increases, which had beenrunning at an annual inflation rate of more than 9 percent over thedriest summer in decades, was expected to be only temporary.   Donald Ratajczak, who tracks price changes for Georgia StateUniversity, said the relief consumers felt at the grocery store fromlower meat prices, the result of early slaughters because ofdrought-depressed supplies of feed grain, would not last.   ``The opposite effect will prevail next spring as the supply ofmeat animals is reduced, forcing prices higher,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
