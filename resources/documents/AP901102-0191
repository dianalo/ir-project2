The bank and 12 of its top U.S. executives were named in a28-count federal indictment alleging violations of currencyreporting laws, operating a bank without a license and conspiringto defraud the Internal Revenue Service since September 1985.   ``I believe, with what the bank did, we are guilty,'' ApostolosGeorgiakis, a governor of the Athens-based bank, told U.S. DistrictJudge Raymond J. Dearie.   The bank agreed to pay $8 million, he said, speaking through aninterpreter.   Federal law enforcement officials say the defendants controlledthe largest money-laundering operation in U.S. history which didnot involve drug money.   U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said the penalty was ``thelargest money-laundering fine ever collected in a non-drug relatedcase.''   Most of the people named in the indictment have pleaded guiltyor agreed to plead guilty to a single count in the indictment. Theindividuals, all Greek citizens who worked in American branches ofthe bank, face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fineswhen they are sentenced next year.   Two defendants, Vasilis Kretsas and Kostas Giziakis, have fledthe United States and remain fugitives, Maloney said.   The bank, the second largest in Greece, had branches in NewYork, the Chicago area and the suburbs of Boston and Philadelphia.   The bank's branches were not authorized to perform usual bankingfunctions in the United States and were only to serve as a liaisonbetween the bank's customers in the United States and the parentbank in Athens.   However, the bank flagrantly violated those limitations andopened accounts, accepted deposits and processed withdrawals forthousands of its customers.   Depositors, under the scheme, brought cash - frequentlysuitcases full - to bank branches. Bank employees would then helpchange the cash into smaller checks or money orders at nearbyAmerican banks, thus circumventing federal reporting laws ondeposits of more than $10,000.   The checks were then transferred to Athens or deposited intobank accounts controlled by the National Mortgage Bank of Greece.   The bank catered almost entirely to Greek-Americans and promotedsecret deposits in the nited States, assuring depositors the bankcould get them money back from Greece in three days without the IRSlearning of the unreported income.</TEXT></DOC>
