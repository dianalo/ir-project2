Early seasons include those which may open before October 1, whilelate seasons may open about October 1 or later. Regulations are developedindependently for early and late seasons. The early-seasons regulationscover mourning, white-winged and white-tipped doves; band-tailed pigeons;rails; moorhens and gallinules; woodcock; and common snipe; sea ducks inthe Atlantic Flyway; September teal; experimental September duck seasonsin identified States; experimental and special September Canada goose seasonsin portions of identified States; sandhill cranes in the Central and PacificFlyways; doves in Hawaii; migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico,and the Virgin Islands; and some extended falconry seasons. Late seasonsinclude the general waterfowl seasons; coots; moorhens and gallinules;and common snipe in the Pacific Flyway; and extended falconry seasons.Certain general procedures are followed in developing regulations for theearly and late seasons. Initial regulatory proposals are announced in a<T4>Federal Register</T4> document published in March and opened to publiccomment. These proposals are supplemented as necessary with additional<T4>Federal Register</T4> documents. Following review of comments receivedand after public hearings, the Service further develops and publishes proposedframeworks for times of seasons, season lengths, shooting hours, dailybag and possession limits, and other regulatory elements. After considerationof additional public comments, the Service publishes final frameworks inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Using these frameworks, State conservation agenciesthen select hunting season dates and options. Upon receipt of State selections,the Service publishes a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, amending Subpart K of 50 CFR Part 20, to establishspecific seasons, bag limits and other regulations. The regulations becomeeffective upon publication. States may prescribe more restrictive seasonsthan those provided in the final frameworks.The regulations schedule for this year is as follows. On March 27, 1989,the Service published for public comment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 12534) a proposal to amend 50 CFR Part20, with comment periods ending as noted earlier. On June 6, 1989, the Service published for public comment a second document(54 FR 24290) which provided supplemental proposals for early- and late-seasonmigratory bird hunting regulations frameworks, with comment periods endingJuly 23, 1989, for early-season proposals, and August 28, 1989, for late-seasonproposals.This document is the third in a series of proposed, supplemental and finalrulemaking documents for migratory bird hunting regulations and deals specificallywith supplemental proposed frameworks for early-season migratory bird huntingregulations. It will lead to final frameworks from which States may selectseason dates, shooting hours and daily bag and possession limits for the1989-90 season. All pertinent comments on the March 27 proposals receivedthrough June 22, 1989, have been considered in developing this document.In addition, new proposals for certain early-season regulations are providedfor public comment. Comment periods on this third document are specifiedabove under DATES. Final regulatory frameworks for migratory game birdhunting seasons for Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and earlyseasons in other areas of the United States are scheduled for publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on or about August 9, 1989. On June 22, 1989, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announcedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 27 (54 FR 12534), June 6 (54 FR 24290),and June 9 (54 FR 24762), 1989, to review the status of mourning, white-wingedand white-tipped doves, band-tailed pigeons, rails, common moorhens, purplegallinules, woodcock, common snipe, sandhill cranes, and preliminary waterfowlinformation. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these speciesand for migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands;experimental duck seasons in September in identified States; experimentalSeptember Canada goose hunting seasons in portions of identified States;special sea duck seasons in the Atlantic Flyway; and extended falconryseasons. This supplemental proposed rulemaking consolidates further changes in theoriginal framework proposals published on March 27, 1989, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 12534). The regulations for early waterfowl hunting seasons proposed in this documentare based on the most current information available about the status ofwaterfowl populations and habitat conditions on the breeding grounds. Thedrought that has plagued the prairies and parklands of Canada and the UnitedStates through most of the 1980s continued into 1989. It is affecting notonly breeding areas but also migration and wintering areas. Although manyareas received greater rainfall than in past years, there was little runoff,pond numbers remained low and nesting cover was scarce. <ITAG tagnum="84">Presentations at Public Hearing </ITAG>A number of reports were given on the status of various migratory birdspecies for which early hunting seasons are being proposed. These are brieflyreviewed as a matter of public information and to facilitate the Service'sresponse to public comments received during the public hearing on June22 and in correspondence. Unless otherwise noted, persons making the presentationsare Service employees. Mr. Brad Bortner, Woodcock Specialist, reported on the 1989 status of Americanwoodcock. The report included harvest information gathered over the last24 years and breeding population information (singing-ground survey) collectedsince 1968. The two surveys are cooperatively run by the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, Canadian Wildlife Service, and 39 State and Provincialwildlife agencies. The most significant findings were from the recentlyconducted singing-ground survey. This survey of woodcock breeding populationsin the United States and Canada indicated minor decreases in woodcock inboth the Eastern Region (Atlantic Flyway) and the Central Region (MississippiFlyway and a portion of the Central Flyway) since 1988. These changes werenot statistically significant. The Eastern Region population has declined34.1 percent since 1968. The Central Region breeding population has decreased18.9 percent since 1968. However, neither population shows any significanttrend for the last 5 years. Mr. David Dolton, Mourning Dove Specialist, presented the status of the1989 mourning dove population. The report included information gatheredover the last 24 years. Trends were calculated for the most recent 2 and10-year intervals and for the entire 24-year period. Between 1988 and 1989,the number of doves heard per call-count route showed no significant changein the 3 management units. Estimates indicated significant downward trendsin the Western Unit for the 10 and 24-year periods. No significant trendwas found in the Eastern Unit for either timeframe. In the Central Unit,a downward trend was indicated for the most recent 10 years, but no trendwas found over the 24-year period. Trends for doves seen at the unit levelover the 24-year period agreed with trends for doves heard. Mr. Ronnie R. George, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, presented informationon the status of white-winged and white-tipped doves in texas. Resultsof the 1989 whitewing call-count survey indicate a nesting population ofabout 375,000 birds in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. This represents 9 percentdecline from 1988 and the index is 27 percent below the long-term average.Approximately 79 percent of the population was nesting in native brushhabitat where a 1 percent increase was noted. Of the 21 percent of thepopulation nesting in citrus groves, there was a 35 percent decrease in1989. In the Upper South Texas region, 3 major colonies exhibited a 3 percentdecline from last year. In West Texas (near Presidio), the small populationof whitewings maintains a stable status. For white-tipped doves, the call-count index indicated a 6 percent declinefrom 1988, but it is still considered to be a healthy population. Mr. Roy Tomlinson, Southwest Dove Coordinator, presented a report on thestatus of white-winged doves in Arizona. In response to whitewing populationdeclines in the 1970's, the Arizona Game and Fish Department instituteda series of restrictive regulations that have been in effect for nearly10 years. Whitewing populations have since remained relatively stable ata reduced level. In 1988, the whitewing harvest of about 100,000 birdswas 11 percent below that in 1987 and remained 45 percent below the 1978-87average harvest. The 1989 call-count survey in Arizona indicated a 15 percentincrease from 1988. Mr. Tomlinson also discussed the status of band-tailed pigeons. The Four-CornersPopulation that breeds in mountainous conifer habitat of Arizona, Utah,Colorado, and New Mexico, has remained stable for the past 20-25 years.Hunting pressure is light and the combined harvest for the 4-State areais less than 5,000 birds annually. The Pacific Coast Population distributed throughout British Columbia, Washington,Oregon, Nevada, and California, appears to be experiencing severe problemsof unknown origin. Population surveys in Oregon and Washington indicatea significant long-term downward trend and the 1988 harvest for the fourStates and one Province indicate a 70 percent decline from the preceding15 year average. Steps are being taken to determine the cause for the decline.Mr. Skip Ladd, Central Flyway Representative, reported on the status ofsandhill cranes. The Mid-continent Population may still be increasing.Preliminary estimates for 1989, uncorrected for visibility, indicated aspring population of about 409,000, the highest count since the currentsurvey technique was initiated in 1978. Approximately 5,100 hunters harvestedabout 12,300 cranes in 8 Central Flyway States in the 1988-89 season, whichrepresents no significant change in harvest from the previous year. Theharvest in Canada was about 7,000 and harvests in Alaska and Mexico combinedare believed to be less than 4,000. Collectively, total harvests of mid-continentsandhill cranes are within guidelines established for this population.The Rocky Mountain Population of greater sandhill cranes was estimatedto number about 19,100 in March of 1988, a figure not significantly differentfrom that of 1985, the last time that adequate survey conditions prevailed,and is within the objective range of 18,000-22,000. The adjusted surveyfigure for 1989 is not yet available but the count, unadjusted for observervisibility bias and proportion of lesser sandhills present, is nearly identicalto that of 1988. Special limited hunting seasons were held during the 1988-89season in New Mexico, Wyoming, and Arizona, where, collectively, the harvestof Rocky Mountain sandhill cranes was approximately 450, down from about1,100 in 1987-88. The reduction in harvest is likely the result of poorproduction of greater sandhill cranes due to drought in breeding areas.Based on this reduced production over the past several years, the allowableretrieved harvest of Rocky Mountain sandhill cranes for 1989-90 seasonswill be reduced to 800, compared to 1,300 allowed in 1988-89. Mr. James Bartonek, Pacific Flyway Representative, described the statusof six populations of Alaska-nesting geese that have been of general concernbecause of their reduced numbers. The endangered Aleutian Canada geese,cackling Canada geese, and the Pacific Flyway Population of white-frontedgeese are tending upward; whereas Pacific brant are stable, the springindex for emperor geese indicates a decrease in the population, the winterindex of dusky Canada geese is low, as it was last year, and with littleprospect for improved production. Information on forecasted fall flightsof these populations will be provided during meetings in July and Augustpertaining to the late-season regulations-setting process. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received at Public Hearing </ITAG>Six individuals presented statements at the public hearing on proposedearly-season regulations and one other submitted a written statement tobe included as part of the hearing transcript. The oral comments are summarizedbelow. Mr. Ronnie R. George, representing the Central Flyway Council and the TexasParks and Wildlife Department, made comments about the 1989-90 huntingseason regulations as follows: 1. September Teal Season_This season should be regarded as an integralpart of the fall duck season, since its purpose was to allow maximizationof sport hunting when other populations of heavily harvested species weredepressed. Suspension of the early teal season in 1988 resulted in reducedhunter interest in waterfowl seasons, reduced waterfowl habitat enhancementprograms on private lands, increased disease problems for wintering waterfowlincluding the loss of 10-15 thousand birds due to cholera, and no subsequentincrease in teal numbers. After 19 years of operational seasons, the tealseason has proven its worth, and should be reinstated under appropriatemodifications to meet current needs. 2. Shooting Hours_A return to one-half hour before sunrise openings isrecommended. The use of shooting hours to control harvest is inappropriate.Shooting hours are basic regulations which prescribe the appropriate timeto hunt. 3. Special Texas White-winged Dove Hunt_Modification of the daily bag limitduring the 4-day Special White-winged Dove hunt is recommended. Specifically,north and west of Del Rio in the Special Hunt Area, the bag limit wouldbe 10 mourning, white-winged and white-tipped doves in the aggregate, nomore than 2 of which could be white-tipped doves; south and east of DelRio in the Special Hunt Area, the bag limit would be 10 doves in the aggregate,no more than 5 of which could be mourning doves and 2 of which could bewhite-tipped doves. 4. Middle Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico, Experimental Sandhill Crane Hunt_Continuationof this hunt in New Mexico is recommended. 5. Deming-Hatch, New Mexico, Sandhill Crane Hunt_Continuation of this southwestNew Mexico crane hunt is recommended for the second year of a 3-year experimentalprogram. 6. Texas Sandhill Crane Hunting Zone_Sandhill cranes have expanded theirwinter range eastward in north-central Texas and an estimated 15-20 thousandsandhill cranes now winter outside the legal crane hunting zone where theycause locally heavy damage to winter wheat. Expansion of the sandhill cranehunting zone in Texas eastward to Interstate Highway 35W is recommended.This measure would reduce crop depredation complaints and increase huntingopportunities. 7. Adoption of a limited experimental sandhill crane hunting season inUtah is recommended. 8. Adoption of proposed basic regulations for webless and waterfowl speciesnot addressed by Recommendation Nos. 1-7 is recommended. Mr. Lauren Schaaf, representing the Kentucky Department of Fish and WildlifeResources, commented about the September wood duck season in Kentucky.He referred to the stepped-up banding effort in the State and expressedhope that these band recovery data will show lower mortality attributedto hunting. He indicated that an increased number of wood duck boxes havebeen installed in recent years and the State has continued to maintainlong-term production surveys. Further, he stated that this season is verypopular among hunters and he urged the Service to continue the Septemberwood duck season. Mr. William Goudy expressed concern about the February 28 framework closingdate for woodcock hunting, particularly in Tennessee. In that State, thehunting season is split, with the second segment held in February, a timewhen woodcock are beginning both to nest in Tennessee and to migrate tomore nothern breeding grounds. He feels that the practice of hunting northwardmigrating woodcock in February is morally and ethically wrong. Mr. Goudyrecommended that the Service review the issue of February woodcock huntingand also restrict the use of the split season option to prevent huntingof birds moving north to nest. Mr. John M. Anderson, representing the National Audubon Society, recommendedcontinuation of restrictive regulations initiated in 1987 for mourningdoves in the Western Management Unit. He also expressed concern about anapparent decline in mourning doves in the States of Iowa, Missouri andArkansas, and encouraged research efforts to further study mourning dovesin that area. He noted that white-winged dove regulations in Texas arecomplicated and research efforts in that area should continue, but thatthe proposed hunting regulations for south Texas appear to be reasonable.Regarding sandhill cranes, he noted that populations appear to be healthyand harvest levels are within management guidelines. He commented thereis no valid reason to change regulations for Mid-Continent Sandhill Cranesin 1989, and there is no apparent reason to oppose the proposal to expandthe area open to sandhill crane hunting in Texas. He stated that regulationsfor seasons on Rocky Mountain Sandhill Cranes appear to be reasonable.Concerning woodcock, he suggested that present regulations are appropriateand strongly recommended against establishment of any additional zonesin the Eastern Management Unit while populations are low. He also stronglyencouraged an in-depth review of the effect of February hunting of woodcockon nesting and population status. He recommended that no liberlizationsbe allowed in the early wood duck seasons. Mr. John C. Kovarik, a Maryland hunting guide, expressed his concern aboutthe recent declines in duck populations and his philosophy of stewardshipresponsibility toward lands, water, habitat and wildlife. He believed thatrestrictive measures taken during recent years were reasonable and necessary;however, he faulted the Service for attributing the reason for the changein the opening shooting hour in 1988 solely to aid in duck identificationrather than to lower the harvest. He believed that the Service lost credibilitywith hunters by this action. He said that the proposed sea duck seasonand limits were both generous and appreciated. He believed the Servicewould restrict this season should circumstances warrant.  Mr. Charles Kelley, representing the Alabama Department of Conservationand Natural Resources, requested that Barbour County be included in thesouth zone for mourning dove hunting. He also stated that February woodcockhunting was halted in Alabama because some woodcock were nesting in February.Mr. Robert L. Miles, submitted a letter on behalf of the Northeast Associationof Fish and Wildlife Resources Agencies, expressing the unanimous concernof the agencies regarding the decline of Eastern Region woodcock populations.The Association urges the prompt final approval and funding of the AmericanWoodcock Management Plan and the implementation of a woodcock hunting permitor stamp. The Association also requested that the hunting regulations forsouthern wintering areas need to be carefully monitored and thoroughlyevaluated. The Service was also urged to work cooperatively with the appropriatecommittees of the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agenciesin formulating a strategy to benefit eastern woodcock.<ITAG tagnum="84">Written Comments Received </ITAG>The preliminary proposed rulemaking which appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated March 27, 1989, (54 FR 12534), opened thepublic comment period for early-season migratory game bird hunting regulations.As of June 22, 1989, the Service had received 54 comments, 49 of thesespecifically addressed early-season related issues. Several of these werepreviously addressed in the supplemental proposed rulemaking which appearedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated June 6, 1989, (54 FR 24290). These early-seasoncomments are summarized below and numbered in the order used in the March27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Only the numbered items pertaining to early-seasonwritten comments are included.1. Shooting HoursThe Atlantic, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Lower RegionRegulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council, the States ofAlaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, NorthDakota, South Carolina and Tennessee, the California Waterfowl Association,a regional representative of the National Rifle Association, a State Chairmanof Duck's Unlimited, 3 local sportsmen's organizations, and 11 individuals,opposed sunrise shooting hours as proposed in the March 27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 12539) for waterfowl and other migratorygame birds for the 1989-90 hunting season. Some of the arguments againstthe proposed regulations included: a. Shooting hours are basic regulations which dictate the time to huntand should not be used to regulate harvest. b. The change to sunrise shooting complicates regulations and will likelyincrease violations. c. Sunrise shooting will shift the harvest away from species such as woodducks to other species of concern, i.e., mallards and pintails. d. The pre-sunrise period is an aesthetic and traditional part of waterfowling.e. Sunrise shooting will erode hunter participation and decrease fundsfor habitat acquisition. f. Restrictive shooting hours were unnecessary to achieve desired reductionsin harvest. Wisconsin and 1 individual supported sunrise shooting hours. The Serviceproposes in this document to provide one-half hour before sunrise shootingfor early-season migratory game birds. 5. Sea DucksA sportsmen's organization supported the proposal for the 107-day seasonand for a bag limit of 7 sea ducks. 6. September Teal SeasonThe Central Flyway Council and the Lower Region Regulations Committee ofthe Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that September teal seasonsbe reinstated. If necessary, these seasons could be restricted to reflecta depressed population status. They suggested that the teal season hasbeen in effect for many years and was originally conceived during a periodof relatively low duck populations, as now exists. The Colorado Divisionof Wildlife also recommended reinstatement of September teal seasons withnecessary adjustments, citing the relatively low harvest rates of blue-wingedteal compared to mallards and the relatively better population status ofblue-winged teal since 1981 compared to other species. The Wisconsin Departmentof Natural Resources supported continued suspension of September teal seasons.8. September Duck SeasonsTennessee supported the proposal to continue the Experimental SeptemberDuck Seasons. 14. Frameworks for Geese and Brant in the Conterminous United States_OutsideDates, Season Length and Bag LimitsThe Pacific Flyway Council requests that the special September Canada gooseseason in Wyoming be modified as follows: the 60 permits for 2 geese perseason and 75 permits for 1 goose per season in two areas allowed in 1988be increased to 160 permits for 2 geese per season for allocation amongthree areas in 1989. 16. Sandhill CranesThe Central Flyway Council recommended continuation of regular seasonsin the Central Flyway without change, except to permit an expansion ofthe area open to hunting in northcentral Texas as described in item 16<T3>Sandhill Cranes_Central Flyway_Regular Seasons, </T3>published in theMarch 27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(at 54 FR 12540-12541). The Service proposesin this rule to permit this expansion of the area open to hunting in Texas.17. CootsThe California Department of Fish and Game (April 24, 1989) requested thatframeworks for coot seasons in the Pacific Flyway be separate from thosefor ducks. The purpose of this change would be to maintain hunter interestduring the period of restrictive duck regulations. Anticipated harvestwould not be expected to exceed that occurring prior to restrictions onduck seasons. Besides providing additional opportunities to hunters, therewould be benefits toward sustaining various management programs. 20. Common SnipeThe California Department of Fish and Game (April 24, 1989) requested thatframeworks for common snipe seasons in the Pacific Flyway be separate fromthose for ducks. The purpose of this change would be to maintain hunterinterest during the period of restrictive duck regulations. Anticipatedharvest would not be expected to exceed that occurring prior to restrictionson duck seasons. Besides providing additional opportunities to hunters,there would be benefits toward sustaining various management programs.23. Mourning DovesIn a letter received June 21, 1989, Tennessee requested that the dailybag limit for mourning doves in the Eastern Management Unit be increasedfrom 12 to 18 birds. 24. White-Winged and White-Tipped DovesIn the March 27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(at 54 FR 12542), the Services reviewed a requestfrom the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for an experimental dove baglimit for its 4-day special season for white-winged doves; an aggregatedaily bag limit of 12 white-winged, mourning, and white-tipped doves, nomore than 2 of which could be white-tipped doves, would be permitted. Theproposal was endorsed by the Central Flyway Council at their March meeting.In a letter dated May 2, 1989, and discussed in the June 6, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 24292), Texas recommended that the originalproposal be modified to limit the aggregate bag limit to 10 doves per dayas follows: northwest of Del Rio, 10 doves, no more than 2 of which couldbe white-tipped doves; southwest of Del Rio, 10 doves, no more than 5 ofwhich could be mourning doves and 2 of which could be white-tipped doves.The Texas proposal includes a program to monitor the effects of the baglimit change if permitted. At the June 22, 1989, public hearing, the Central Flyway Council endorsedthe modified Texas proposal. The Service, after considering informationon the status of mourning and white-winged doves in Texas and the likelyeffect of this experimental limit, proposes to permit this bag limit experiment.25. Migratory Bird Hunting Seasons in AlaskaThe Alaska Department of Fish and Game expressed concern about taking disproportionatelygreater reductions in pintail harvest opportunities then elsewhere butdid not ask for a change in those limits. It urged continuation of openingshooting time one-half hour before sunrise for all migratory bird huntingseasons in Alaska. The Service has proposed (54 FR 12534) that the beginningtime be changed to sunrise. Alaska argued that the change would have littleimpact on harvest, it would elevate hunter dissatisfaction, and the effectivenessof the change could not be measured. To justify their position, Alaskareiterated arguments presented previously by the Pacific Flyway Council,specifically: a. While seasons and limits were generous, early migrations and freezeupresulted in harvest and hunting opportunity much less than that for otherStates.b. Because of disproportionate cuts in pintail harvest opportunities, areduction in shooting hours would give false impressions regarding theexpected reductions in harvests of this species as a result of this restriction.c. Hunters may compensate for this change by increasing harvest after sunrise,therefore, nullifying anticipated reductions in harvest.d. There is no ``refuging'' of ducks in Alaska which in some other areasmakes the earlier opening time more important for harvest.e. As much as 75 percent of the duck harvest is in coastal areas wheretidal cycles are sometimes more influential on bird movements than daylight.f. Civil Twilight is longer at higher than lower latitudes.g. Opportunities for hunting other species of migratory game birds wouldbe unnecessarily restricted.A regional spokesman for the National Rifle Association also expressedopposition to the sunrise shooting time in Alaska.27. FalconryThe Service received letters from 5 falconry organizations and 3 individualsexpressing their support for both the extended falconry seasons and theproposal to simplify the bag and possession limits. One of these organizationsalso requested a clarification of the proposal to limit the number of segmentsallowed during the falconry extended seasons. The proposal is to limitthe number of segments to no more than 3 for each extended falconry season.The proposed rule under item 27 in this document should clarify the originalproposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">Public Comment Invited</ITAG>Based on the results of migratory game bird studies now in progress andhaving due consideration for any data or views submitted by interestedparties, the possible amendments resulting from this supplemental rulemakingwill specify open seasons, shooting hours and bag and possession limitsfor designated migratory game birds in the United States.The Service intends that adopted final rules be as responsive as possibleto all concerned interests and therefore desires to obtain for considerationthe comments and suggestions of the public, other concerned governmentalagencies and private interests of these proposals. Such comments, and anyadditional information received, may lead to final regulations that differfrom these proposals. Special circumstances are involved in the establishment of these regulationswhich limit the amount of time which the Service can allow for public comment.Specifically, two considerations compress the time in which the rulemakingprocess must operate: the need, on the one hand, to establish final rulesat a point early enough in the summer to allow affected State agenciesto appropriately adjust their licensing and regulatory mechanisms, and,on the other hand, the unavailability before mid-June of specific, reliabledata on this year's status of some waterfowl, and migratory shore and uplandgame bird populations. Therefore, the Service believes that to allow commentperiods past the dates specified earlier is contrary to the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="81">Comment Procedure</ITAG>It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practical,to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.Accordingly, interested persons may participate by submitting written commentsto the Director (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Departmentof the Interior, Room 634-Arlington Square, Washington, DC 20240. Commentsreceived will be available for public inspection during normal businesshours at the Service's office in Room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia.All relevant comments on these early-season proposals received no laterthan July 23, 1989, and on late-season proposals received by August 28,1989, will be considered.
