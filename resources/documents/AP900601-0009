(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It rained nine days after an Indianwater ceremony, and Three Valleys Municipal Water District officialscoping with a four-year drought are impressed.   ``I'm a pragmatic person,'' said Three Valleys Municipal WaterDistrict executive Paul Stiglich, whose agency paid for theceremony. ``The Indians came. They danced. It rained. We'll probablysend them a thank you note.''   Tony Romero, the 67-year-old patriarch of the Chumash Reservationin Santa Ynez, said it wasn't exactly a rain dance. It was a waterceremony, he said, an act of reverence for one of the Earth'snatural resources.   Three Valleys provides water for about 500,000 residents of theeastern San Gabriel Valley, 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.   The district paid Romero and his family $1,000 to perform at anannual water awareness luncheon on May 18. Nine days later, asurprise one-inch deluge soaked the region. Not enough to stop thedrought, but a nice surprise, officials said.   ``The whole idea was really for them just to share the reverencethey have for water and other natural resources. But I'm not goingto say it didn't help,'' said district General Manager RichardHansen.   Romero said he doesn't have any power to make it rain, but henotes if you pray hard enough your voice might just be heard.   ``Everything we did was sincere and from the heart,'' Romero saidafter the Memorial Day weekend storm. ``If they think it helped,then don't spoil it for them.''</TEXT></DOC>
