The moderate growth of the economy, analysts said, is likely to leave Federal Reserve System credit policy in neutral for now, and interest rates in much the same position.    Retail sales in February rose 4.1%, which was above most forecasters' expectations, but grew 1.5% after excluding auto sales data. Moreover, the Commerce Department reported a huge 7.4% drop in January retail sales, revised from a previously reported 5.8% decline.    &quot;To a large extent, the retail sales numbers were a wash,&quot; said Charles Lieberman, director of financial markets research for Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. The data were yet another indication, he said, that economic growth is continuing at a moderate pace that's preventing the Fed from easing credit conditions and making a tightening move unnecessary.    Kenneth Mayland, chief economist of First Pennsylvania Bank of Philadelphia, said bond prices rose slightly early in the day chiefly because traders focused mainly on the surprisingly large downward revision in January retail sales. But dealers said the small rally faded later in the day as institutional investors showed little appetite for bonds.    Bond yields &quot;still look like they are in a holding pattern,&quot; said Roger A. Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions, a Mount Kisco, N.Y., fixed-income forecasting and advisory firm. Mr. Froehlich said he expects 30-year Treasury bond yields, which are now just over 7 1/2%, to hover between 7 3/8% and 7 5/8% &quot;right through the second quarter.&quot;    A Federal Reserve report today is expected to indicate a healthy gain in industrial production last month. According to the average estimate of 15 analysts polled by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, industrial production rose about 0.7% in February after a 0.4% rise in January. Estimates ranged from 0.4% to 1%.    Also to be reported today is the Labor Department's producer price index for last month. Most analysts expect an increase of about 0.4% or 0.5%, which would compare with a 0.6% rise in January.    Bond traders paid little attention to money supply figures reported late yesterday by the Federal Reserve. The data, as expected, showed a small $600 million decline in the basic measure, M1, in the week ended March 2. A broader measure, M2, fell $1.6 billion during February, while an even broader yardstick, M3, increased $3 billion.    That contrasted sharply with strong growth in M2 and M3 during January and brought both measures close to the lower end of the Fed's target range of 5 1/2% to 8 1/2% growth this year. The M2 measure has grown at about a 5.9% annual pace from its average level in last year's fourth quarter, while M3 has increased at about a 6.1% pace in that period. The Fed doesn't have a target for M1 this year.    Although some analysts were encouraged by the slowdown in money growth, which they say could help damp inflation fear, most forecasters agree the figures won't lead to any changes in the Federal Reserve's credit policy. Fed officials have made it clear that money supply figures are likely to play less of a role in the Fed's credit strategy than overall U.S. and international economic trends.    According to the Fed, the M1 measure fell to a seasonally adjusted average of $738 billion in the March 2 week from $738.6 billion the previous week. Other Fed figures showed:    --The M1 measure in February declined to a seasonally adjusted average of $736.8 billion from $737.6 billion in January.    --The M2 measure fell to a seasonally adjusted average of $2.8186 trillion in February from $2.8202 trillion in January.    --The M3 measure rose to $3.5146 trillion last month from $3.5116 trillion in January.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 1.57 points yesterday to close at 1425.09. The index once again stayed in a relatively tight band, hovering between 1422.92 and 1426.97.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 were quoted late yesterday at a price of 99 23/32 to yield 7.52%. That compared with a price of 99 22/32, where the yield also was 7.52%, late Wednesday. At one point early yesterday, the issue traded as high as 99 29/32. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose slightly to 100 8/32 from 100 7/32, as the yield declined to 7.21% from 7.22%.    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills also were little changed. The latest three-month Treasury bill rate fell slightly to 5.67% bid from 5.68% Wednesday. The latest six-month Tresury bill rate rose slightly to 5.64% bid from 5.63%.    The federal funds rate edged lower. The rate on funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged about 6.16% yesterday after averaging 6.32% Wednesday and 6.29% Tuesday.    Corporate bond prices edged higher yesterday. Among new issues, $150 million of Anheuser-Busch Cos. sinking fund debentures were offered through underwriters led by Dillon, Read andamp; Co. The 8 1/2% debentures, due March 1, 2017, were priced at 99 to yield 8.593%.    Scheduled for today is a $150 million offering of NZI Capital Corp. 8 1/4% notes, due March 15, 1997. The issue was priced yesterday at 99.261 to yield 8.36%. Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. heads the underwriting group.    In the municipal market, an issue of $127 million of general purpose refunding and improvement bonds of Fort Worth, Texas, was priced to yield from 4% in 1988 to 6.70% in 2007 through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. </TEXT></DOC>
