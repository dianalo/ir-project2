The league's surprise announcement immediately threw into doubtthe second nationally televised confrontation between thepresidential candidates, which had been scheduled for Oct. 13 orOct 14.   League president Nancy M. Neuman said the group was presentedwith a debate agreement between the Bush and Dukakis campaigns andwas told that the league had to accept it.   ``The campaigns' agreement was a closed-door masterpiece,'' shesaid. ``The agreement was a done deal, they told us.''   ``It turned out that the league had two choices,'' she said.``We could sign their closed-door agreement and hope the eventwould rise above their manipulations or we could refuse to lend ourtrusted name to this charade.''   Ms. Neuman said: ``The League of Women Voters is announcingtoday that we have no intention of becoming an accessory to thehoodwinking of the American people. ... Under these circumstances,the league is withdrawing its sponsorship of the presidentialdebate scheduled for mid-October in Los Angeles.''   In letters to Bush campaign chairman James Baker III and Dukakiscampaign chairman Paul Brountas, she said the league wouldreconsider its stance if the campaigns withdrew their``non-negotiable demands.''   The league released a copy of the candidates' agreement.   ``It spelled out everything,'' Ms. Neuman said. ``Betweenthemselves, the campaigns had determined what the TV cameras couldtake pictures of. They had determined how they would select whowould pose questions to their candidates.   ``They had determined that the press would be relegated to thelast two rows of the hall. They had determined that they would packthe hall with their supporters. They had determined the format.''   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk, campaigning with Dukakisin Connecticut, said a joint party debate commission could assumesponsorship and hold the second debate either as scheduled or aftera brief delay.   The campaigns' agreement calls for each side's ``best efforts toobtain a mutually agreeable sponsor'' if one of the originalsponsors drop out.   There was no certainty Bush would agree to a new sponsor. TheGOP nominee holds a narrow lead over Dukakis in national publicopinion polls and was the one who insisted on league involvement inthe debates.   Kirk brushed aside any possibility that Bush might notparticipate in a second debate.   ``They may try, but I don't think they can,'' he said. ``Theyare committed to two presidential debates and the American peopleare well aware of that. Even if they tried to do an end run aroundit, I don't think they can get out of it.''   Bush, at Edwards Air Force Base in California, said he was notaware of the League's withdrawal. When reporters asked Bush whetherhe would attend if the joint party commission picked upsponsorship, the vice president said, ``I can't answer ahypothetical question.''   The league, the traditional sponsor of presidential debates, waspushed aside in the battle for sponsorship of the firstpresidential debate held Sept. 25 in Winston-Salem, N.C., by acommission created by the two major political parties.   The Dukakis campaign sided with the party commission early inthe year, but the Bush campaign left the issue of sponsorship openuntil after the GOP National Convention in August.   Then the campaigns negotiated a compromise in which the twoscheduled debates were split between the two contending sponsors.   The party commission also was awarded the sponsorship of thedebate this Wednesday in Omaha, Neb., between Democratic vicepresidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen and his Republicancounterpart, Dan Quayle.   The league had already signed contracts for a hall in LosAngeles and made other arrangments for the second Bush-Dukakisdebate.   But knowledgeable sources said there was no agreement about thestage, podiums or panel of questioners for the second debate, andthat the campaigns had not discussed final arrangements with theleague by late last week.</TEXT></DOC>
