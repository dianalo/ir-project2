The free meetings were not supported by the national or localAssemblies of God, Swaggart's former denomination. But manyfollowers had already forgiven the Baton Rouge evangelist.   ``I came out to support him. I feel as Christians we really needto stick together,'' said Glorisdine Smith, an Indianapolisschoolteacher who brought her two children. ``I'm pretty sure otherministers are sinning. They just haven't been found out yet.''   Jerri Smoot, 24, made her yearly trip from Danville, Ill., withher husband and two children to see Swaggart.   ``I have forgiven him. When he got on TV and told the wholeworld to forgive him, I think they did,'' she said.   In February, Swaggart made a tearful televised confession thathe had committed an unspecified sin against God and his family. Theconfession was followed by allegations he hired a prostitute toperform lewd acts while he watched.   Debra Murphree, the self-admitted prostitute who contendedSwaggart paid her to perform, lives in Patoka, Ind.   Swaggart captivated the crowd when he shook the Bible andhighstepped across the stage in moves reminiscent of his cousin,rock singer Jerry Lee Lewis.   ``I would love to be more calm were I talking about AbrahamLincoln, but I'm talking about Jesus,'' he said.   He later directed followers who thought they had committed sinsto the foot of the stage where he ``saved'' them.   Donald Rodgers, 41, of Indianapolis, was among a handful ofprotesters outside Market Square Arena before the revival. Somecarried signs reading ``Ban Christianity'' and ``Ban the Bible.''   ``He pays a prostitute, gets caught, gets thrown out of churchand still wants to preach,'' Rodgers said. ``He calls himself aChristian. The man is a hypocrite.''   Inside, Swaggart urged followers to contribute up to $100 incash or checks, promising ``every dime and dollar'' would help savehis ailing television show that appears on few stations nationwide.   Each cancellation of his show makes him ``feel like my heart hasbeen ripped out,'' Swaggart said.   An extensive selection of Swaggart albums, tapes, videocassettesand books was for sale during the crusade, and volunteers promoted10 albums or five tapes for $20.   ``People never tire of hearing the word (of God),'' said a womanvolunteer who declined to give her name.   No estimate on the value of Friday's contributions and sales wasavailable from crusade officials.   Swaggart returned to the pulpit May 22, but was defrocked by theAssemblies of God for refusing to abstain from preaching for a yearwhile undergoing professional counseling. He said hismultimillion-dollar global ministry could not survive such anabsence.   Swaggart, 52, said the Indianapolis crusade offered a freshstart.   ``I've changed an awful lot,'' he said after a dress rehearsal.``I'm more keenly aware of the hurt and pain of other people. I'mmore aware of their weaknesses and despair.''</TEXT></DOC>
