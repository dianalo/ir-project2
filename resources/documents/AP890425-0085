Students at Beijing universities today boycotted classes for asecond day to appeal for democracy, freedom of speech and press,and talks with the government.   The boycott began Monday after a week of street demonstrationssparked by the April 15 death of former Communist Party chief HuYaobang, an advocate of reform. Tens of thousands of students frommore than a dozen universities have taken part.   The Communist Party's official People's Daily blamed the unreston ``a handful of students with ulterior motives.   ``This is a planned conspiracy, an upheaval, that in essenceaims at negating the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party andthe socialist system,'' the paper said in an editorial broadcasttoday on national television and radio.   The editorial was the strongest warning yet that governmenttolerance of the students was nearing an end.   It said conspirators had used ``the grief of students tofabricate rumors in an attempt to create greater unrest.   ``This is a grave political struggle facing the whole party andthe people of all nationalities.''   It called on the nation to unite against public disturbances andprotect ``hard-earned political stability.''   The broadcast of the editorial was played repeatedly overloudspeakers at several major universities.   ``This is their first step. We can expect arrests to comesoon,'' said one student activist at Beijing University.   Students and residents of the district where most of thestrike-bound universities are located reported troops from outlyingcounties had moved into the area in preparation for an eventualcrackdown.   Informed sources said more than 10,000 troops had been broughtin.   The official Xinhua News Agency said late today that governmentofficials had arranged a meeting with student representatives atQinghua University, where most of the more than 10,000 students areboycottng classes.   But it said students failed to show up and officials were toldthey had been unable to agree on who would represent them.   The incident appeared to reflect a growing division amongstudents who want to reduce tensions and those who want to holdmore large-scale marches and rallies. Most students want tocontinue the protests in some form until May 4, the 70thanniversary of China's first pro-democracy student movement.   ``The divisions are not serious,'' said one student leader. Butposter boards at Beijing University were plastered with pleas forunity.   ``If we return to class, we will be condemned by the ages, wewill be the scum of Chinese history,'' said one poster. ``Pleaseremember ... We are writing history.''   Students leaders sent activists to street corners to givespeeches explaining their demands for a free press, respect forhuman rights and an end to official privileges and corruption.   Many also are calling for senior leaders such as Premier Li Pengto resign.   ``Most workers are sympathetic to the students, but they don'tdare take part,'' said a worker who used his lunch break to go heartaped speeches by Beijing University students just outside thecampus.   He said his factory and others were given orders to keep workersin line, but that the main obstacle was fear of losing their wages.   ``The students have no responsibilities, but what can I do?'' hesaid as he held his small son. ``If I stop working what will mychild eat?''   The students' condemnation of official corruption has appeal tomany workers because profiteering on the sale of raw materials hasbecome a major business for many factory officials.   The students also have won sympathy among journalists, whosestate-controlled publications have been barred from publishing newsof the class boycott.   Only two newspapers have mentioned the student marches fordemocracy, and one, Science and Technology Daily, managed to getits edition to the streets only after the reporters threatened toquit en masse.</TEXT></DOC>
