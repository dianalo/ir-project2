The use of renewable energy sources are of specialinterest here. It is suspected that about 2 to 4% of our energy consumptionwill be covered by renewable energy sources by the year 2000. However,due to the reduction in energy prices in recent years, one does not expectthis to reach even 2%. This means that renewable energy sources do notoffer an alternative to the use of conventional energy media in the mediumterm. However, photovoltaics is regarded as one of the most importantenergy technologies of the future. One wants to develop regenerativeenergy as hard as possible by supporting research and development, aidsin introduction to the market, information and advice to consumers. Theelectricity economy, upon a policy initiative, has declared itself tobe ready to improve the conditions for feeding in electricity. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
