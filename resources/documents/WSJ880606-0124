The Labor Department also said that its index of hourly wages rose 0.5% for the second month in a row, or at a 6.1% annual rate that suggests tight labor markets may finally be yielding a pickup in wages. &quot;It's a warning signal,&quot; said economist Samuel Kahan of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.    The increase in the civilian unemployment rate, the first in six months, was played down by economists. The rate has been hovering around 5.5% for the past few months. The April decline of 0.2 percentage points and the May rise have little significance, economists said.    Based on the department's survey of employers, non-farm payrolls grew by 209,000 after rising a revised 249,000 in April and 467,000 in March. The department previously put the April increase at 174,000. But a separate survey of households, used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a 520,000 decline in the number of employed people in April.    &quot;At this time of the year, I believe it more appropriate to focus on the business survey, which shows continued -- although somewhat slower -- growth,&quot; Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, said in testimony submitted Friday to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.    Nearly all the May increase in payrolls came in the services sector of the economy. In the service sector, payroll employment increased by 201,000 to 80 million. Employment gains in the wholesale trade and health-services industries were particularly strong. &quot;More jobs have been created in the health-services industry over the last year than in any previous year,&quot; Mrs. Norwood said. The industry employed 7.2 million in May. In comparison, all finance, insurance and real estate companies combined employed 6.6 million people.    In the goods-producing sector, which includes construction and mining, employment rose by 8,000 in May to 25.4 million.    Manufacturing payrolls rose by 16,000 to 19.5 million, although hiring was strong in some industries that are participating in the U.S. export boom, particularly machinery and fabricated metals. &quot;It's disappointing that manufacturing isn't doing better,&quot; said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. &quot;It has to do better than that if we're going to do better on trade.&quot;    But other economists took a rosier view. Norman Robertson of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh suggested that manufacturers are increasing output by improving productivity, rather than adding workers. &quot;That's very positive,&quot; he said.    And John Hagens of WEFA Group Inc., Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said that although the length of the average factory workweek slipped to 41.1 hours from 41.2 hours the month before, it's &quot;still very high.&quot; Manufacturing overtime averaged four hours in May, unchanged from April.    The Labor Department report gave new ammunition to economists and those on Wall Street who fear that inflation will worsen. &quot;It's wishful thinking to believe that we can avoid accelerating wages at an unemployment rate of about 5.5%,&quot; said Roger Brinner, a Data Resources economist.    The 0.5% increase in the average hourly earnings index, which excludes the effects of overtime and shift differentials, is &quot;a notch higher than what we've seen over the last several years.&quot; He added, however, that it is still too soon to conclude that a new era of wage inflation has arrived.    Treasury Secretary James Baker, on CBS-TV's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; yesterday, said, &quot;Fears of inflation are vastly overblown.&quot; He added that the Federal Reserve Board is doing a &quot;good job&quot; maintaining the balance between spurring growth and battling inflation.    Hourly earnings of production workers rose to $9.28 in May from $9.22 in April. Average weekly earnings rose to $322.02 from $321.78.    An alternative measure of the unemployment rate, which counts the military among the employed, rose to 5.5% in May from 5.4%.    Unemployment rates among minority groups continue to far exceed those among whites. The jobless rate among whites was 4.7% in May, compared with 12.4% among blacks and 9% among Hispanics. Among teen-agers who are looking for work, the differences are even sharper. For whites, the jobless rate was 13.1%; for blacks, it was 34.8%.    Regional disparities also persist. The unemployment rate in Massachusetts in May was 2.8%, down from 2.9%, while in New Jersey it rose to 3.7% from 3.5%. In contrast, the jobless rate declined to 7.2% from 7.5% in Texas and to 6.5% from 7.4% in Michigan.    All the figures are adjusted for usual seasonal fluctuations.
