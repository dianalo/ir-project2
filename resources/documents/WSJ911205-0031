The award is one of the biggest clearcut payoffs yet fromthe many U.S. government efforts to pry open the Japanesemarket. The Japanese government had originally earmarked thetwo NTT satellites for its fledgling domestic industry, butU.S. threats of retaliation forced Tokyo last year to openall commercial satellite contracts to internationalcompetition.                                                                                                          Ultimately, no Japanese companies even attempted to bidfor the NTT communications project. Loral beat out two otherU.S. competitors, General Electric Co. and General MotorsCorp.'s Hughes Aircraft division.   However, the contract isn't a total loss for Japaneseindustry. Mitsubishi Electric Corp., which made Japan's lasttwo communications satellites, will work as a subcontractorfor Loral, and is expected to make a &quot;significant&quot; share ofthe new system, an industry source said. Mitsubishi Corp.,the trading company and flagship of Mitsubishi Electric'sindustrial group, represented Loral for the bid.   Indeed, some government and industry officials saidLoral's ties to the powerful Mitsubishi group may have helpedwhat many perceived as an underdog win the bid.   Loral, a defense electronics concern, entered thesatellite business just last year by acquiring Ford AerospaceCorp. for $715 million, and it has only about two-thirds ofthe world commercial satellite business of industry leadersHughes and GE. A Ford communications satellite owned by aprivate Japanese consortium broke down in space last year,and last month Loral was eliminated from bidding to buildSouth Korea's first communications satellite.   NTT officials said they based their decision on the priceand quality of the submitted bids. Mitsubishi officialsdeclined to comment on the award.   Shortly after buying the Ford satellite unit, Loral sold49% of it to three European companies for $182 million, whileretaining operating control. This is the largest contract yetawarded to Space Systems/Loral, as the venture is now called.   In an interview, Bernard L. Schwartz, Loral chairman, saidthe contract award is &quot;significant not just for the dollaramount, but because it reaffirms the relationships we have inthe satellite business in Japan. And it reaffirms thestrategy of the alliance {with the three European companies},proving that four companies can work together, pooling ourresources.&quot;   The two N-STAR communications satellites that Loral willbuild are among the most ambitious ever attempted, combiningfour different frequencies and several functions, includingcommunications between Japan's islands, disaster relief andmobile-phone services. Both satellites are scheduled to belaunched in 1995 and are supposed to last for 10 years.   Foreign purchases still make up less than 5% of NTT'sannual multibillion-dollar equipment budget, but have beengrowing steadily. The telecommunications giant last year paid$465 million for foreign equipment, up 32% from the yearbefore and 25 times the level of its foreign purchases in1981.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
