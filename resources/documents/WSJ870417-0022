The income of Connecticut residents rose 6.1% in 1986 to $19,208, more than twice the $9,552 of Mississippi, the lowest-ranking state. New Jersey came in second, with per-capita income rising 6.2% to $18,284. Alaska, where per-capita income last year fell 2.2% to $17,744, placed third.    Nationwide, per-capita income last year was $14,461, up 4.3% from 1985.    The department said the largest percentage gains last year generally occurred in high-income regions -- including the New England states, New Jersey, Washington D.C., New York, Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania. These states benefited both from strength in construction and in business and financial services, and from slow population growth.    The smallest gains came in low-income areas -- including the Rocky Mountain and Southwest states. These states were hurt by the drop in oil prices. In addition, population growth was rapid in the Southwest. </TEXT></DOC>
