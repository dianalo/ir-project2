Legislative AuthoritySection 408(a)(1) of the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986 (DemonstrationPartnership Agreements Addressing the Needs of the Poor) authorizes theSecretary to make grants for the development and implementation of newand innovative approaches to deal with particularly critical needs or problemsof the poor which are common to a number of communities.2. Definitions of TermsFor purposes of this program announcement, the following definitions apply:<T3>Eligible entity: </T3>Any organization which (1) was officially designatedas a community action agency or a community action program under the provisionsof section 210 of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 for fiscal year1981 and did not lose its designation; or (2) was a limited purpose agencydesignated under Title II of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 for fiscalyear 1981 which served the general purposes of a community action agencyunder Title II of such Act and did not lose its designation; or (3) receivedfinancial assistance under section 222(a)(4) of the Economic OpportunityAct of 1964 in fiscal year 1981; or (4) received a grant in fiscal year1984 under the waiver provision of Pub. L. 98-139; or (5) was created undersection 673(1)(C) of the Community Services Block Grant Act to serve ageographic area not previously served; or (6) came into existence duringfiscal year 1982 as a direct successor in interest to a community actionagency or community action program and meets all the requirements undersection 675(c)(3) of the Community Services Block Grant Act. All ``eligibleentities'' are current recipients of Community Services Block Grant funds.The majority of ``eligible entities'' are community action agencies. Inthose cases where ``eligible entity'' status is unclear, final determinationwill be made by FSA.<T3>Hypothesis: </T3>A tentative assumption made in order to draw out andtest its consequences, e.g., completing a vocational training program byprisoners leads to a reduction in recidivism.<T3>Innovative project: </T3>One that departs from or significantly modifiespast program practices and tests a new approach.<T3>Intervention: </T3>Any activity within a project that is intended toproduce changes in the target population or the environment, and can beformally evaluated during the project. An example of an intervention isthe conduct of vocational training in prison to prepare prisoners for employmentfollowing release from prison.<T3>Partnership: </T3>A formal negotiated arrangement between an eligibleentity and another organization (or organizations) that provides for substantivepolicy and management roles for each of the partners in the conduct ofthe project. An arrangement where the applicant serves only as a conduitfor the funds is <T3>not </T3>a partnership.<T3>Self-sufficiency: </T3>In the ideal sense, a condition where an individualor family, by reason of employment, does not need and is not eligible for,public assistance. Individuals and families may be more or less self sufficient,or intermittently self-sufficient, with some income from employment butnot enough over the long term to become totally independent of public assistance.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part B_Purpose</ITAG>The purposes of this program are (1) to stimulate eligible entities todevelop new approaches to provide for greater self-sufficiency of the poor;(2) to test and evaluate the new approaches; (3) to disseminate projectresults and evaluation findings so that the new approaches can be replicated;and (4) to strengthen the ability of eligible entities to integrate, coordinate,and redirect activities to promote maximum self-sufficiency among the poor.Projects must:(a) Involve activities which can be incorporated into, or be closely coordinatedwith, eligible entities' ongoing programs; (b) Involve significant new combinations of resources or new and innovativeapproaches involving partnership agreements;(c) Be structured in a way that will, within the limits of the type ofassistance or activities contemplated, most fully and effectively promotethe purposes of the Community Services Block Grant Act as amended.Partnership(s) between the applicant and one or more other organizationsis a requirement for funding. Projects must have a measurable and potentiallymajor impact on the causes of poverty, should be applicable to other localitieswith similar problems, and should have the potential for widespread replicationby eligible entities.OCS intends that projects funded under this announcement will be conductedon a scale broad enough to permit a valid evaluation.Although all proposals must focus on developing new ways of promoting individualand family self-sufficiency, OCS will not prescribe specific hypothesesto be tested nor specific population groups or geographic areas to be targeted.However, among the many problems relating to poverty and dependency, thereare a number which merit special attention and which OCS encourages applicantsto address.With respect to families, it is clear that families now dependent on suchprograms as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Low IncomeHome Energy Assistance, and Food Stamps will be unable to achieve self-sufficiencywithout stable, sustained and adequate employment income. It is also clearthat programs that have focused exclusively on jobs or job training havenot always led to self-sufficiency. The challenge to applicants for fundsunder this program is to test new approaches to a range of problems familymembers encounter in trying to obtain permanent jobs.One such major problem is the scarcity of support systems that offer integratedfamily services covering the whole time period needed to achieve self-sufficiency.OCS welcomes the submission of proposals that test various ways of applyingthe integration of services concept, including a job training/job creationcomponent, to families who depend on public assistance on a continuingor intermittent basis.Another pervasive problem is that of teenage pregnancy. Many teenage mothersare on public assistance and fully half of the welfare budget supportsfamilies in which the mother had her first child as a teenager. OCS encouragesthe submission of proposals to test new ways in which the resources ofthe community can be mobilized to prevent premature family formation. Anotherserious problem is that of unemployed young men. Many anti poverty programshave concentrated on serving female-headed households as a way of reducingpublic assistance dependency while too few programs have addressed theneeds of young men in the most impoverished urban and rural areas. Theseprograms, if they exist at all, have generally failed to qualify theseyoung men for the jobs that remain in the inner cities and impoverishedrural areas. OCS would be interested in testing whether providing thesemen with the specific skill(s) training and related services necessaryto be hired for these jobs will stimulate family reunification and promoteeconomic self-sufficiency.The problems caused by the lack of integrated support systems for headsof households who are seeking work, unemployed young men and at-risk teenagersdo not, of course, exhaust the range of major problems confronting thepoor. Applications proposing new approaches to other problems are welcomeso long as such problems affect large numbers of urban and/or rural poorand are serious obstacles to the achievement of self-sufficiency.Whatever problem or problems the applicant chooses to address, the applicantwill be expected to propose solutions that depart from or modify conventionalapproaches and that show promise of being highly effective.Frequently, efforts by low-income families to achieve self-sufficiency,as well as efforts by service providers to help such families become self-sufficient,are impeded by legislative, administrative, and regulatory requirementsat the Federal, State, and local levels. Applicants are encouraged to identifyand address these impediments where feasible and appropriate.The use of funds for the purchase, construction or improvement of realproperty is prohibited. This prohibition includes expenditures for weatherizationand home repairs.Eligible applicants are those ``eligible entities'' defined in Part A,Section 2., Definitions of Terms, of this announcement and whose eligibilitystatus and capability have been certified by the State Director of theCommunity Services Block Grant program. (See Part F, Section 5c for certificationrequirements.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Part C_Application Prerequisites</ITAG>1. Availability of Fundsa. OCS is spreading its administrative review process more evenly acrossthe fiscal year. In order to accomplish this, OCS is publishing this ProgramAnnouncement prior to the Congress completing its deliberations on appropriationsfor this program for FY 1989. Grants will only be made based on the availabilityof funds. The amount of funds available and the expected number of grantsthat will be made when, and if, such funds become available is not knownat the present time.b. Grant requests will be considered for an amount up to $250,000 in OCSfunds.2. Grant DurationThe period of the grant award will be determined by the nature of the individualproject and the justification presented in the application. However, nogrant period shall exceed 24 months.3. Matching FundsAn applicant is required to obtain commitment of at least one private orpublic sector dollar for each dollar of OCS funds awarded. Thus, if anapplicant is requesting $175,000 in OCS funds, at least $175,000 in additionalfunds must be committed to the project from private or public sector sources.Public sector resources that can be counted toward the minimum match includefunds from State and local governments, and funds from various block grantsallocated to the States by the Federal Government providing the authorizinglegislation for these grants does not prohibit such use. Federal fundsother than block grant funds may not be used to satisfy the minimum matchrequirement, although such funds may be applied to the project, if permittedby the Federal statutes governing the use of these funds. There is an exceptionto the use of block grant funds for a demonstration project under thisprogram. The ninety percent Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) fundsthat by statute are designated for use by eligible entities may not beused for the minimum match. However, OCS will accept any of the remainingten percent (CSBG funds) as match, as well as other block grant funds transferredinto the Community Services Block Grant.Funds identified by the applicant as those which will be counted towardthe minimum match requirement may be in the form of cash or in-kind fairlyconverted into its dollar equivalent. Such funds must be definitely committedor contingent only on receipt of an OCS grant, and must be applied to specificproject activities within the OCS-approved project and used only for projectpurposes for the duration of the OCS grant.Funds expended or obligated prior to the approved OCS starting date fora grant cannot be considered as matching funds. Documentation of matchingfunds must be in the form of letters of commitment from the donors.4. Maintenance of EffortThe activities funded under this program announcement must be in additionto, and not in substitution for, activities previously carried on withoutFederal assistance. Also, funds or other resources currently devoted toactivities designed to meet the needs of the poor within a community, area,or State must not be reduced in order to provide the required matchingcontributions.This provision will generally allow the use of block grant funds as matchingfunds for the demonstration project when the applicant shows that it hasreceived a real increase in its block grant allotment or demonstrates thatother anti-poverty programs will not be scaled back to provide the match.5. Administrative and Indirect CostsOCS will accept applications that include administrative costs. However,no more than 10% of the OCS funds may be used for administrative purposes.Administrative costs are defined as costs that are necessary to protect,monitor and properly account for Federal funds awarded. Costs associatedwith the internal operational management of the approved project are notconsidered to be administrative costs nor are costs for conducting thefinal audit or the third-party evaluations.Grant funds may also be used for indirect costs. In all cases where anapplicant has negotiated and claims a current indirect cost rate approvedby the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Defense ContractingAgency, or some other Federal agency, this rate ordinarily will be recognizedby OCS and applied to any OCS grant award. However, it is understood thatboth administrative and indirect costs are part of, and not in additionto, the amount of funds awarded in the subject grant. In most cases, theindirect cost rate approved will include not only administrative costsbut also other allowable costs that were negotiated under the applicant'sapproved indirect cost rate.Therefore, applicants with an applicable indirect cost rate exceeding 10%of the OCS grant may not propose any administrative funds in excess ofthat rate. Thus, although the approved indirect cost rate may exceed thenormal 10% administrative cost restriction, the entire approved indirectcost rate will be accepted.6. Program BeneficiariesProjects proposed for funding under this announcement must result in directbenefits for low-income persons whose incomes are up to 125% of the DHHSpoverty income guidelines as defined in the most recent Annual Revisionof Poverty Income Guidelines published by DHHS.Attachment A to this announcement is an excerpt from the most recentlypublished guidelines. Annual revisions of these guidelines are normallypublished in February or early March of each year and are applicable toprojects being implemented at the time of publication. (These revised guidelinesmay be obtained through the U.S. Government Printing Office at the followingaddress: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,Washington, DC 20402.)No other government agency or privately defined poverty guidelines areapplicable for the determination of low-income eligibility for this OCSprogram.7. Multiple SubmittalsNo applications will be considered for funding which are being submittedunder other OCS program announcements.8. Sub-Contracting or Delegating ProjectsOCS will not fund any project where the role of the eligible applicantis <T3>primarily</T3> to serve as a conduit for funds to organizations otherthan the applicant. This prohibition does not bar subcontracting for specificservices needed to conduct the project.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part D_Application Procedures</ITAG>1.

Intergovernmental ReviewThe OCS Demonstration Partnership Program is covered by Executive Order12372 which provides for review of proposed Federal assistance by Stateand local governments. Therefore, applicants for funds under this announcementare subject to the clearance procedures and requirements established bythe State(s) in which their projects will be conducted. Consequently, applicantsare reminded that clearance action through appropriate State clearinghousesmust be initiated by them prior to, or simultaneous with, submittal ofapplications to OCS. These initial actions must be reported on the SF 424,Page 1, which is submitted to OCS. Clearance action by States need notbe completed before applications are submitted to OCS. When comments becomeavailable they should be forwarded to the Family Support Administrationoffice to which applications are submitted. (See address in item 2. above.)4. Application ConsiderationApplications which meet the screening requirements in section 5 below willbe reviewed competitively. Such applications will be referred to reviewersfor a numerical score and explanatory comments based solely on responsivenessto the purposes outlined in Part B, the guidelines in Part F, and ratingcriteria published in this announcement.Applications will be reviewed and rated by persons outside of the OCS unitwhich will be directly responsible for management of the grant.The results of these reviews will assist the Director and OCS program staffin considering competing applications. Reviewers' scores will weigh heavilyin funding decisions but will not be the only factors considered. Applicationswill generally be considered in order of the average scores assigned byreviewers. However, highly ranked applications are not guaranteed fundingsince the Director may also consider other relevant factors including,but not limited to, comments of reviewers and other government officials;program staff quality review; geographic distribution; previous programperformance of applicants; compliance with grant terms under previous DHHSgrants; findings in audit and investigative reports; and applicant's progressin resolving any final audit disallowances on OCS or other Federal agencygrants.OCS reserves the right to discuss applications with other Federal or non-Federalfunding sources to determine the applicant's performance record.5.
