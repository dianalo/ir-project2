While last month's stock market collapse aroused speculation of a recession and sparked a sharp drop in interest rates, the nation's huge dependence on foreign capital to finance its deficit continues to weigh heavily on the foreign-exchange and credit markets.    &quot;The dollar is more likely to go down because of a failure of the budget deficit to go down in 1988,&quot; said Robert Giordano, a partner and co-director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    Although Mr. Giordano expects a brief economic slump next year, he contends that bond prices aren't likely to rally much further. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, now about 8.9%, are likely to trade between 8.5% and 9.5% over the next three to six months, he predicted. &quot;Inflation is more likely to go up than down,&quot; a trend that would cool investor enthusiasm for bonds, he said.    Bond prices plunged early yesterday, largely reflecting a deep slump in the dollar. But prices partly recovered later as the dollar rebounded on comments by President Reagan that he doesn't want the dollar to go lower.    Some actively traded long-term Treasury bonds ended the session with declines of almost half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Trading volume was lackluster.    The yield on the latest 30-year bond rose slightly to about 8 7/8% from 8.84% Monday. Still, that was well below the 10 3/8% level that prevailed as recently as Oct. 15, just before the stock market's collapse radically altered the credit landscape.    &quot;The market just traded around with no real direction,&quot; said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. &quot;The big thing will be what comes out of Washington with the budget deficit negotiations.&quot;    Moreover, bond traders also are nervous about what the government's trade report for September will show. That report will be released by the Commerce Department tomorrow morning. Traders recall vividly how the previous report, which showed the deficit narrowed only slightly to $15.68 billion in August from $16.47 billion in July, sent shock waves through the financial markets in mid-October.    Despite the bond market's explosive rally since mid-October, non-investment grade, or &quot;junk,&quot; bonds are struggling. Yesterday, for example, Southland Corp. postponed a $1.5 billion offering, needed to complete a $4 billion leveraged buy-out of the convenience store chain.    The canceled offering was a major embarrassement for underwriters Goldman, Sachs Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc. Both firms had advanced loans initially totaling $600 million as bridge financing for the LBO. The junk bond market &quot;is in tough shape,&quot; said Gerald Rosenfeld, a managing director in the corporate finance department at Salomon.    However, Mr. Rosenfeld said Salomon's initial $300 million in bridge financing for the LBO has been reduced to &quot;net exposure of $115 million. Obviously, we think the deal will get done and we'll have the loan paid off.&quot; Officials at Goldman Sachs weren't immediately available for comment on when the offering might be rescheduled.    The postponement of the Southland offering helped buoy the junk bond market yesterday, which has been in a slump since the stock market collapse last month. Many seasoned issues have plummeted in price because they, like the proposed Southland offering, depended on the borrower's asset sales to meet interest payments on the bonds. As a result, the gap between yields on some junk bonds and Treasury bonds has widened to as much as eight percentage points, reflecting investor fears of a recession.    Many highly rated borrowers also have had to pay higher margins over Treasurys because of investor skittishness. &quot;There is a distinct possibility spreads could widen substantially in these times of stress,&quot; said Jack Greenberg, executive vice president and chief financial officer at McDonald's Corp. in Oakbrook, Ill. Although Mr. Greenberg believes &quot;rates will decline a little more&quot; in the months ahead, he didn't hesitate to raise $100 million for the company last week with a $100 million offering of 9.75% coupon 30-year bonds.    The company paid about 1 1/8 percentage points more than a comparable Treasury issue, &quot;a spread that was wider than we've paid in the past,&quot; Mr. Greenberg said. But he said he was happy to borrow long-term funds at a single-digit rate now &quot;because there's a risk borrowing costs could rise for corporations. Every chief financial officer in the country worries about that prospect&quot; in the wake of the stock market collapse, he said.    In the meantime, he said the government &quot;is walking a narrow line&quot; by trying to avert a recession without igniting inflation pressures. &quot;So far, business has been very good and I don't hear much about&quot; the stock market plunge &quot;out here,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a possibility we'll end up with significantly higher rates a year from now,&quot; because of inflation pressures.    But many economists say such worries aren't justified. &quot;The inflationary fears that dominated the credit markets most of this year have been eliminated for the time being,&quot; said Albert Gross, an economist at Refco Inc. &quot;I think we could have a recession next year and that, as a result, bonds are a good buy right now,&quot; he said, citing weak commodity prices and sagging consumer confidence.    Mr. Gross predicted that yields on long-term Treasury bonds could drop to as low as 8% in the months ahead. &quot;We've had a major change in investor psychology,&quot; he said.    Among the major developments in the credit markets yesterday:    --The latest 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late in the afternon at a price of 99 28/32, down from 100 10/32 late Monday. The yield increased to 8.89% from 8.84%.    --The latest 10-year Treasury notes were quoted late yesterday at a price of 100 1/2 to yield 8.80%. That compared with Monday's close of 100 26/32 to yield 8.75%.    --An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. fell 5.41 points to 1257.44. It ranged between 1251.05 and 1265.20.    --The federal funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.63% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was down from 6.82% Monday and 6.70% last Friday.    --Rates fell on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month rate declined to 5.66% bid from an average of 5.74% set at Monday's auction, while the latest six-month rate declined to 6.19% bid yesterday from the Monday auction average of 6.24%.    In the corporate sector, a $300 million issue of General Electric Credit Corp. notes due in five years was offered to investors yesterday. The 8 3/4% notes were priced at 99.562 to yield 8.86%, or 0.6 percentage point over five-year Treasury notes. Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. headed the underwriting group for the issue, which is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Separately, a $150 million issue of First Interstate Bancorp 9 3/8% notes, due November 1992, were priced at par, or 1 1/8 percentage points above the five-year Treasury note. Salomon Brothers headed the underwriters for the issue, which is rated double-A-3 by Moody's and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's.    In the municipal sector, Los Angeles sold $125 million of waste-water system revenue bonds. An underwriting group led by E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. said the bonds were priced after auction to yield from 5.25% in 1988 to about 8.17% in 2017. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A by Sandamp;P. </TEXT></DOC>
