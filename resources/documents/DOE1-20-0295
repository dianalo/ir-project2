Generationand inverse scattering methods have been applied to a number of suchequations, including the gravitational field equations when symmetriesare present. Unfortunately, most of the relevant applications are restrictedto cases with two independent variables, with the notable exception ofthe self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four-dimensional Euclidean spaceand a few other examples. This work is motivated by the questions ofwhether it is possible to use similar techniques in the general case(i.e., without symmetries) of the Einstein field equations in vacuum.As a preliminary step, it seems necessary to formulate the equationsin a compact form, and in particular in such a way that integrabilityconditions are easily taken care of. To this end, it seems appropriateto use differential forms; the possibility of working with such conditionsin a transparent way is a built-in feature of the differential form language.</TEXT></DOC>
