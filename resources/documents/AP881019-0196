The aim of the six-page book, said NRA board member JimZangrilli of suburban Oak Park, is to stop youngsters' accidentalshootings with the message that they shouldn't touch any weaponsthey find but instead summon an adult.   ``It's a very cute coloring book,'' he said. ``The cover shows alittle boy and girl shaking hands with Eddie the Eagle, and it says`My gun safety book.'''   The NRA wants Chicago-area schools to use the book, but the ideahas received a lukewarm reception from school officials.   ``If I wanted a program on that topic in schools, I surelywouldn't go to the National Rifle Association for help,'' saidBrother Donald Houde, director of administrative affairs for theChicago Archdiocese's Office of Catholic Education. He had not seenthe book.   Zangrilli plans to send the book to officials at the city'spublic and parochial schools this week. ``We hope they'll allowschools in the Chicago area to utilize this thing,'' he said.   Chicago Board of Education spokesman Bob Saigh said that withoutseeing the book, he could not comment. He said any proposal fromthe NRA would receive ``appropriate consideration.''   Zangrilli said the book does not promote the NRA or seek to winthe youngsters over to its positions on gun control. He said thegroup's name was written only in small letters on the back page.   ``We're always happy when people join the NRA,'' he said. ``Butthat's not the purpose of it. The purpose is to stop accidentalshootings.''   He said the message emphasized is that if children find a gun,they should ``stop, don't touch, leave the area, tell an adult.''   ``The reality of the real world is there's firearms all over thereal world,'' Zangrilli said. ``We think it's a very good idea totell children in the schools not to touch them.''   Cmdr. Sollie Vincent, head of the police department's gangcrimes unit, said that while the message might be important, theschools probably are not the proper place to teach it.   ``It seems to me that stressing gun safety in the classroom is afairly negative approach,'' Vincent said. ``It assumes that gunsare going to be available to children. And if that is the case,that is adequate reason for removing guns out of society.''   Nationally, of the 3,097 youths killed with guns in 1985, 519died accidentally, according to the most recent figures availablefrom the National Center for Health Statistics.</TEXT></DOC>
