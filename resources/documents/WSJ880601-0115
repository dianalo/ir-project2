In an important victory for the regulatory agencies, the high court ruled 9-0 that the suspension process doesn't violate the constitutional rights of bank officials.    Federal law gives the appropriate banking agency up to 30 days to hold a hearing if the suspended official requests one, and up to 60 days after the hearing to issue a decision.    In a case involving Farmers State Bank in Kanawha, Iowa, a federal district court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said in February 1987 that the federal law is unconstitutional because the period of suspension without a hearing or final ruling is too long.    In an opinion by Justice John Stevens, the Supreme Court ruled that the government's interests in protecting depositors outweighs the interests of the bank officers in having a hearing before the suspension, and that the public interest calls for a thoughtful process after the suspension has begun.    The case involved the suspension by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. of James Mallen, the president of Farmers Bank, who was indicted for making false statements in a personal financial form.    Ronald Glancz, a former FDIC counsel, said yesterday that the ruling strengthens the hands of all agencies regulating banks, thrifts and credit unions. &quot;It is a significant weapon against bank fraud,&quot; he said.    Natural Gas Prices   The Supreme Court voted 8-0 to uphold Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules, reversing a federal appeals court's March 1987 decision that federal officials said would have raised natural gas prices $100 million a year for consumers.    The appeals court in Denver rejected FERC rules for pricing of some gas that, for technical reasons, qualifies under a 1978 federal law for both price-regulated and deregulated status. FERC said such gas should be treated as deregulated, but the appeals court said gas producers should be allowed to choose the status giving them the highest price.    The regulations were challenged by a long list of major natural gas producers.    Justice Brennan wrote the opinion. Justice White didn't vote in the case.    Delaware vs. New York   The justices gave Delaware permission to sue New York directly in the high court in a dispute over millions of dollars in unclaimed stock dividends and interest.    The fight is over which of the two states may claim ownership of funds and securities that accumulate from dividends and interest and aren't clearly the property of brokerages or their clients. &quot;We believe there's tens of millions of dollars involved,&quot; said Fred Silverman, deputy attorney general of Delaware.    The funds accumulate because of the timing of some securities transactions. A brokerage may be the record owner of securities that it is holding for a client. Sometimes, a brokerage sells the securities in the open market, and before the new buyer has removed the brokerage as the owner of record, a split may occur or a dividend may be issued. The proceeds are issued to the brokerage, but their ownership is unclear.    New York officials have been pressing major brokerages with offices in New York to turn over to the state these unclaimed funds. But Delaware officials say the unclaimed funds or securities should revert to the state in which the brokerages are incorporated, Delaware.    William Fitzpatrick, counsel to the Securities Industry Association, says the industry &quot;is getting whacked by both sides. We want to get out of the middle.&quot;    Gasohol Tax Credit   The high court, 9-0, struck down a 1985 Ohio law that provides a tax credit for certain gasohol purchases. In an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court said the Ohio law, challenged by New Energy Co., an Indiana ethanol manufacturer, unconstitutionally interferes with interstate commerce.    The Ohio credit is available for gasohol made with ethanol produced in Ohio, or in another state, provided the other state gives a credit for gasohol made with ethanol from Ohio. Gasohol is a blend of gasoline and ethanol used as motor fuel.    Punitive Damages   The high court let stand seven separate awards of punitive damages against companies. On May 16, the high court, by a 7-0 vote, decided not to rule on a challenge to the constitutionality of punitive damage awards, saying the issue wasn't properly raised in a Mississippi insurance case. The court had heard arguments that such awards violate the Constitution's prohibition of &quot;excessive fines&quot; and its guarantee of &quot;due process.&quot;    Yesterday, the justices chose not to select another test of the constitutionality of punitive damages from among seven cases they had held for the May 16 ruling. Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, and apparently Justice Scalia, indicated an interest in hearing a further punitive damages test case, but they didn't have the votes needed to grant such a review. That makes it unlikely the court will get back to the issue in the near future.    The court let stand the following punitive damage awards:   --$10 million in Kansas against Playtex Holdings Inc. in the death of a woman from toxic shock syndrome.    --$5 million in California against an Ohio Casualty Corp. unit, for failure to pay on a &quot;fidelity bond&quot; indemnifying a savings and loan, Downey Savings andamp; Loan Association, for any employee fraud.    --$3.5 million in California against Atlantic Richfield Co., for contract misrepresentation to a gas station owner.    --$1.3 million in Alabama against Treadwell Ford Inc. for the death of a person hit by an allegedly defective Ford pickup truck.    --$350,000 in Mississippi against an American General Corp. unit for bad faith failure to pay a $2,500 life insurance claim.    --$124,000 in Alabama against Mobile Dodge Inc. for sale of a Corvette for which it didn't have fully valid title.    --$100,000 in Idaho against Aluminum Company of America for manufacturing the aluminum shell of a bottle cap that exploded. </TEXT></DOC>
