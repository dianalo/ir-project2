The disclosures came Friday as authorities announced the first indictments in the case and said cash and cocaine have been used to influence radio stations' choice of music.    Payoffs have been made to gain air time for &quot;just about every artist you can imagine,&quot; said Richard Stavin, an attorney with the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force here. More charges are considered likely as the investigation continues, but authorities said there isn't any evidence the record companies knew of the payoffs.    On Friday, prosecutors said a federal grand jury had indicted Ralph Tashjian, an independent promoter from San Mateo, Calif., and his wife, Valerie, as well as William Craig of Scottsdale, Ariz., and George Wilson Crowell of Denver.    Attorneys for the Tashjians said the couple is innocent of all the charges. Mr. Craig also said he is innocent. Mr. Crowell couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Tashjian, 40 years old, was charged with making undisclosed payments, known as payola, to radio station program directors in Fresno, Calif., and El Paso, Texas, from 1980 to 1985. He was also charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine, obstruction of justice, and tax evasion. Mrs. Tashjian, 31, was charged with tax evasion.    Mr. Craig, 42, another independent record promoter, was charged with making illegal payments to gain airtime for records in Cincinnati, Atlanta, Kansas City, Mo., Memphis, Tenn., Charlotte, N.C., and Jacksonville, Fla. Mr. Craig was also accused of filing false corporate tax returns, and evading individual income taxes.    Mr. Craig said he and Mr. Tashjian at times shared offices with Joseph Isgro, another independent promoter who has been under federal investigation but who hasn't been indicted.    Mr. Crowell, 59, a former general manager of radio station KIQQ in Los Angeles, was charged with failing to file tax returns for 1984, 1985 and 1986. The indictment also says Mr. Crowell got more than $100,000 in 1984 and 1985 in illegal undisclosed payments.    The payola investigation began in 1986 and grew out of an inquiry into organized crime influence in the record business. Last year that investigation led to the indictment of Salvatore J. Pisello on charges that he evaded income taxes on nearly $600,000 of income derived from dealings with a unit of MCA Inc. Prosecutors said Mr. Pisello acted as an intermediary in certain MCA record transactions. </TEXT></DOC>
