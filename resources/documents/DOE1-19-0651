Sincetritiated water is more radiotoxic than tritium gas, we need to calculatethe concentrations of HTO which may occur in the atmosphere during andafter the release of tritium gas. This can be achieved if we know thedeposition rate of tritium gas and the rate at which the deposited tritiumis resuspended to atmosphere. The resuspension rate has been determinedby mathematical modelling and experimental simulation. The soil-plantsystem is assumed to consist of N soil layers and one plant compartment.The tritiated water content of the soil and the plants is described bya system of simultaneous, first-order, linear, differential equationswith discontinuous, variable coefficients. The coefficients are derivedfrom the phenomenological equations of transfer processes at plant andsoil surfaces and through the soil profile. The parameters needed asentry to the model are water vapor concentrations at soil-atmosphereinterface, soil moistures and water fluxes at different depths in thesoil. The resuspension rate, defined as the fraction of the depositedHTO which is resuspended per unit time, is computed from the evolutionof HTO content in the totality of soil profile. In parallel to the developmentof the model, an experimental simulation was done to determine the resuspensionrate and its evolution during a period of 10 days, by covering a smallarea of undisturbed soil by a field chamber, exposing the enclosed soilto tritium gas, then flushing the chamber at a high flow rate and collectingperiodically the resuspended tritiated water. The model and experimentalvalues of the initial resuspension rates were similar and comprised between1 and 5 %.</TEXT></DOC>
