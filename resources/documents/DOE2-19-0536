Both freezing (melting) water as well as solidifiyingliquid metal problems are examined. Emphasis is placed on weak formulationsas they tend to be simple to program and easily implemented in existingsingle-phase codes. A new method based on the apparent capacity techniqueis proposed. In this technique an ''effective capacity'' is computed,based on the integration of temperature profiles over the nodal volumes.This method shows significantly better performance when compared withother methods for the numerical analysis of solidifying metals.</TEXT></DOC>
