Sweeping tax-law changes, the argument went, would make people lose their taste for acquisitions.    So much for prevailing wisdom. With domestic and foreign acquirers toting war chests bursting with strongly valued foreign currencies or U.S. stocks, takeover activity has rebounded from a lackluster first quarter to post a robust first half.    &quot;Things haven't been nearly as bad as one might have thought,&quot; says Hamilton E. James, head of mergers at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities Corp. Adds Joseph Flom, a top takeover lawyer: &quot;Business has come back nicely. We're working 'round the clock again.&quot;    In the first five months this year, 2,056 corporate mergers and acquisitions were announced, totaling $106.3 billion, according to Mergers and Acquisitions magazine, a trade publication. This compares with 1,800 deals totaling $78.2 billion during the same period in 1986.    Driving the resurgence, investment bankers and takeover lawyers say, are a strong stock market, low interest rates, a weak dollar, greater use of innovative new financing techniques such as so-called &quot;bridge loans&quot; and a concern that various anti-takeover legislative initiatives might eventually put a brake on new deals. Some takeover specialists, uneasy about interest rates, have said they wanted to move while rates remain relatively low. And still other deals have been spurred by deregulation or increased competition in such industries as retailing, airlines and financial services.    However, &quot;the outlook for the second half is cloudy,&quot; says Mr. Flom. He and other takeover professionals worry that several recent legislative moves in Congress and various states, and a Supreme Court decision affirming Indiana's tough anti-takeover law, could hobble merger and acquisition activity.    In the meantime, such merger activity is prompting many targets or prospective targets to take increasingly risky defensive moves. The latest rage is recapitalization plans, in which companies shrink equity and boost debt, often by paying a huge one-time dividend to shareholders. In recent weeks such plans have been announced by Allegis Corp., which plans to borrow $3 billion to pay a $60-a-share dividend to shareholders, and Caesars World Inc. The Allegis plan is under review. Other targets, such as GenCorp Inc., have chosen expensive stock buybacks, and Burlington Industries Inc. and Supermarkets General Corp. have used leveraged buyouts, in which companies are taken private largely with borrowed funds and the debt is paid from the cash flow and sale of assets of the companies.    The increase in acquisition activity has come despite the notable absence of some of Wall Street's most visible takeover players. Amid the continuing insider trading scandal, financier Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and investor Carl Icahn, under investigation in the continuing insider-trading scandal, have kept low profiles. Both have denied wrongdoing. Other takeover specialists such as Irwin Jacobs and Victor Posner have busied themselves tending to troubled financial empires, while Texas raider T. Boone Pickens, has taken up a crusade for &quot;shareholder rights&quot; -- that is, giving maximum value to shareholders and not allowing corporate managements to devise anti-takeover measures at the expense of shareholders. In their places are lesser known figures such as Ronald O. Perelman of Revlon Group Inc. and New York investors Asher Edelman and Martin Sosnoff.    The expected slowdown in takeover activity did, in fact, materialize early in 1987, but the hangover from a year-end merger mania, when companies raced to buy and merge before the new tax law took effect, lasted only a month or two. Wall Street firms like Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., worried about a decline in merger business, began aggressively courting new clients. And, in a twist that has allowed merger professionals to take an even more active role in the business, firms like Shearson, First Boston Corp. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. often put their own money into deals.    Typically, these firms lend acquirers money that acts as a &quot;bridge&quot; until permanent financing can be obtained elsewhere. The bridge-loan tactic, originally devised to compete with Drexel Burnham's powerful junk-bond financing, also has served to fill the gap created by Drexel's reduced presence in the hostile takeover arena. &quot;One additional reason we're getting business now is we can provide bridges,&quot; says J. Tomilson Hill, co-head of Shearson's merger department. &quot;It's an added bullet in our gun.&quot;    Thus, many Wall Street merger departments are growing at a time they weren't supposed to grow. Shearson and Donaldson Lufkin have both increased their merger staffs 20%. PaineWebber Inc.'s acquisition group posted a record first half, and is rapidly adding staff.    Many of the new takeover customers are foreign. Carrying coffers fattened by a weak dollar, they feasted on U.S. concerns in the first half. British concerns seemed especially busy: Grand Metropolitan PLC agreed to buy the Heublein unit from RJR Nabisco Inc. for $1.2 billion, and Argyll Group PLC agreed to acquire Safeway Stores Inc.'s unit in Britain for $1.04 billion. And the summer began with acrimonious transatlantic battles for control of Harcourt Brace and JWT Group Inc., a major advertising company.    &quot;Our foreign business is up significantly -- our London office is going gangbusters,&quot; says Peter Slusser, a managing director in PaineWebber's mergers department.    The Japanese also have been active. Among the several deals made or proposed recently, Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals Inc. this week offered $52.50 a share for Reichhold Chemicals Inc., which it valued at $473 million. Reichhold shares immediately shot up, closing yesterday at $60.50, up $18.25, suggesting a higher bid could come. But Dainippon is known as an aggressive pursuer. Last year it prevailed in getting Sun Chemical Corp.'s graphic-arts materials group for $550 million.    Some of the first half's takeover activity represented a sorting-out process, after last year's hot merger market. Nearly 4,000 deals were completed in the fourth quarter alone, according to Mergers and Acquisitions. Many of last year's buyers are now divesting, to raise money and shed unwanted businesses. And other deals that were spawned in last year's frenzy -- but put off because of regulatory or other delays -- weren't struck until early this year.    Meanwhile, the bullish stock market, which largely quashed takeover activity early last year, has proved something of a blessing in disguise for takeovers, investment bankers say. While higher stock prices have meant fewer bargains for takeover-hungry companies, they also have meant an increase in value of the acquirers themselves. Such companies can buy a lot more with their own stock in swap deals.    &quot;This a liquidity-driven business, and the markets are just incredibly liquid right now,&quot; says Jeffrey Berenson, a managing director in Merrill Lynch's merger department. &quot;There are huge pools of money lying around.&quot; Paine Webber's Mr. Slusser adds: &quot;The market definitely has helped psychology. Businessmen feel much more positive about their deals.&quot;    And for sellers, the hot market has produced top-dollar bids for their shares. Pittsburgh-based Cyclops Corp., for example, was trading in the 60s early in the year when a bidding war broke out that ultimately resulted in a $95-a-share block purchase by Dixons Group PLC that gave it controlling interest.    &quot;A lot of sellers are looking around, saying, 'If I'm ever going to sell, now is the time,'&quot; says Mr. James of Donaldson Lufkin. &quot;A lot more of them are putting themselves on the block.&quot;    The red-hot market, however, may be hurting some aggressive suitors in subtle ways, merger experts suggest. With stock prices so high, shareholders are now far more willing to take securities, or &quot;stubs,&quot; in addition to cash and notes issued to them by companies in defensive recapitalizations.    &quot;The stubs are given a higher value,&quot; says Mr. Flom, the takeover lawyer. &quot;This kind of market tends to produce deals that knock the original bidder out of the box,&quot; because many raiders are unwilling to grant large equity stakes to current shareholders.    Continued strong stock prices, as expected, produced more stock swaps in the first half. Security Pacific Corp. agreed to buy Seattle-based Rainier Bancorp. in a $1.1 billion stock swap, almost certainly the biggest acquisition in banking history. Chrysler Corp. bought out rival American Motors Corp. in a deal heavily weighted with Chrysler common.    More common, however, may be companies like USAir Group Inc., which, according to one person close to the company, stretched its cash reserves to the limit to pay $1.7 billion for Piedmont Aviation Inc. The reason: confidence that the stock-hungry public would quickly grab a subsequent equity offering.    So far 1987, like much of 1986, hasn't seen megadeals such as those in 1985, with the exception of British Petroleum Co.'s $7.9 billion agreement to buy the 45% of Standard Oil Co. it didn't own. But potential acquirers like Ford Motor Co., which has $9.4 billion cash and marketable securities, and Beatrice Corp., have signaled that they might make big deals by the end of the year.    ---   Takeovers Announced                                   1/1/87-        1/1/86-                                   5/29/87        5/29/87 Under $250 million                    803            778 $250 million to $499 million                        39             42 $500 million to $999 million                        21             24 $1 billion and over                    23             10 No value announced                  1,170            946 TOTAL                               2,056          1,800   Source: Mergers andamp; Acquisitions magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
