The goodwill visit came one day after Soviet President MikhailGorbachev visited Shanghai.   The warships originally were scheduled to arrive Thursday butwere delayed for one day. Although no official explanation wasgiven for the delay, the Soviets apparently saw the coincidence ofthe port call with Gorbachev's visit as a diplomatic affront.   The three U.S. vessels sailed up the Huangpu River, commonwaters for foreign warships at the turn of the century when foreignpowers dominated Shanghai with gunboat diplomacy. Decorative flagsdotted the masts and sailors lined the rails for a look at China'slargest city.   More than 200,000 students and workers marched and ralliedthrough the city of 12 million Friday for the second straight dayin support of larger, related protests in Beijing. About 100,000were gathered a short distance down the Huangpu River from wherethe American vessels docked.   Barry Matney, a press officer for the Seventh Fleet, said thecommand and control ship USS Blueridge, the cruiser USS Sterett andthe guided missile frigate USS Rodney M. Davis will be in Shanghaiuntil Monday.   He said the 2,500 naval personnel aboard the ships had beenadvised to avoid the demonstrations but were to be granted libertyto visit the city as scheduled. He said they were to be in uniformwhen touring the city.   He said not many people watched the arrival because most peoplewere more interested in the demonstrations.   The first U.S. Navy port call to communist China was in November1986, when three warships visited the Yellow Sea port of Qingdao.Last month a Chinese Navy training vessel visited Honolulu incommunist China's first port call in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
