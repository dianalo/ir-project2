Mr. Yastrow paid the bill -- then sent the lawyer a shaving kit, pajamas, slippers, and a note alluding to his long hours at the office. He also forwarded a copy of the note to the law firm's managing partner.    The lawyer's hours dropped the next month, as did the McDonald's bill.    Outside legal fees have grown so rapidly in recent years that many companies are doing whatever they can to control them. Their methods include the closer monitoring of outside firms reflected in Mr. Yastrow's veiled scolding to making firms bid for business to doing more work in-house.    &quot;The days when a lawyer turned in a $100,000 bill for services rendered {without further explanation} are gone,&quot; says Kenneth Bornholdt, general counsel at Bixby Ranch Co., Los Angeles.    Some lawyers suggest the cost-cutting may affect the quality of work by outside firms. &quot;General counsel who negotiate lower hourly rates are often charged for more hours, or are billed for a lot of garbage time,&quot; says Thomas Bauch, general counsel of Levi Strauss andamp; Co. &quot;And if you are an important but not critical client, you may end up with less desirable lawyers working on your case.&quot; Mr. Bauch pays one of the company's longtime outside trial lawyers a monthly fee to spend half of his time on Levi cases, but he says he's wary of making similar arrangements with lawyers he doesn't know well.    But others say they haven't seen any difference as the result of efforts to economize. &quot;Quality hasn't suffered,&quot; says John Kelly, administrative officer of the law department at Travelers Corp. &quot;We deal with fine firms and wouldn't expect them to compromise their legal standards. If they agree to do the business, they do it.&quot;    The trend of costs is clear. Arthur Young andamp; Co., a consulting firm based in New York, found in a survey that companies' average outside legal expenses rose to $4.7 million last year from $3.8 million in 1986.    One reason for the higher legal bills is law firms' own rapidly rising salaries. Two years ago, the New York law firm Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore raised starting associate salaries to $65,000 from $53,000, an unusually big rise that triggered a round of similar increases at other firms. So associate billing rates have surged, though partner rates haven't grown as fast.    Lawyers say other costs are climbing as well. &quot;The practice of law has become capital-intensive,&quot; says Warren Tomlinson, a partner at the Denver law firm Holland andamp; Hart. &quot;You need word-processing equipment, you need computers. It takes a lot of money to practice law today.&quot;    Increasingly, general counsel are trying to restrain them. One strategy is to have law firms set -- and hold to -- budgets. At Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., &quot;we used to be surprised by the size of our bills,&quot; says Peter Mear, head of the corporate litigation department. Mr. Mear often discovered charges for full-scale research projects when he knew similar work had already been done in-house. Or research that the law firm had estimated would only take 12 hours suddenly stretched to 30.    Now outside firms must submit budgets to Mr. Mear, and they aren't allowed to go over budget without authorization from an Aetna lawyer. &quot;We have not paid some bills because they exceeded the budget without authorization,&quot; Mr. Mear says.    In one case, a lawyer handling a lawsuit for Aetna called one of his firm's branch offices and spent four hours consulting with a colleague there about the local courts and the opposition's lawyers. Then he billed Aetna for four hours' time for each of the lawyers, or more than $1,000. But the consultation hadn't been included in the budget, and Mr. Mear considered it unnecessary. Aetna refused to pay the bill.    Some general counsel are soliciting bids from outside firms before assigning work. Peter Zeughauser of Irvine Co., a big realestate developer in Newport Beach, Calif., often requests bids for a particular case from two or three firms, along with staffing plans and strategies.    When a trade group to which Irvine belongs decided to challenge a fee assessed by a government agency, Mr. Zeughauser sought bids to handle the case. One firm told him that it had two lawyers who were specialists in the issue and could handle the case. A second firm said the suit would require at least four lawyers. Mr. Zeughauser estimates that he saved $50,000 to $100,000 by going with the first firm.    Like many general counsel, Mr. Zeughauser also negotiates with law firms to handle all of Irvine's work in particular fields at reduced rates. The company now sends all its unlawful-detainer suits -- the formal proceedings necessary to evict tenants who fail to pay rent -- to three outside law firms. In exchange for Irvine's regular business, the firms charge the company 10% to 15% less than their usual hourly rates. &quot;We're able to do this because we're a major developer,&quot; Mr. Zeughauser says. &quot;Smaller clients might not be able to negotiate the kinds of fees we do.&quot;    Closer monitoring of outside firms also can help cut costs. At the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, outside legal bills surged to $85.6 million in fiscal 1987 from $37.3 million in fiscal 1986, partly reflecting the pace of savings and loan failures. In addition to requiring budgets and case plans, the Bank Board is instituting tighter supervision of outside law firms, says Jack D. Smith, deputy general counsel. The number of lawyers involved in overseeing firms has increased to 48 from 21 since 1986. And in each case involving an outside firm, one in-house lawyer acts as a liaison and must authorize any changes in personnel, as well as in drafts of all documents and filings. With this arrangement, the in-house attorneys can quickly detect any discrepancies in bills, Mr. Smith says, and they regularly demand reductions in rates if they feel a firm was inefficient.    Mr. Yastrow of McDonald's adds, &quot;If a law firm tells me they're going to use six people, I ask what do you need six people for? On a routine case if they want to give me a $200-an-hour partner, I say why not an associate that a partner supervises?&quot;    Some companies are installing computer systems to aid in both monitoring outside firms and working more efficiently. Xerox Corp. recently set up a $55,000 computer system connecting it with the two outside law firms it uses most, the Los Angeles firm of Latham andamp; Watkins and New York City's Kelley Drye andamp; Warren. Four lawyers at each firm were given terminals, printers and access to Xerox's in-house files on their cases.    Robert Banks, general counsel, uses the system to keep track of legal costs during each stage of a case and to identify areas in which too much money is being spent. He can estimate the difference in cost between using outside counsel and hiring enough lawyers to handle a matter in-house. And he can project costs to help determine when it would be more economical to settle a case.    Perhaps a more straightforward way to cut costs is simply to use lawyers who charge less. Mr. Banks used to send Xerox work automatically to big Wall Street firms, but now he searches for firms outside New York City, where rates are lower. Donald P. Walsh, general counsel of Sun Co., tries to find lawyers with special expertise at small firms, which often charge less than larger firms.    Cheaper still are in-house lawyers and paralegals. In 1983, 37% of surveyed law departments told Arthur Young andamp; Co., that they handled at least some of their litigation internally. By 1987, that figure had jumped to 75%.    In two years, Travelers has increased its number of in-house lawyers to 525 from 388. George McKeon, general counsel, says the cost of a lawsuit averages $2,100 when handled by an in-house lawyer, $2,800 by an outside firm. In the past five years, Mr. McKeon estimates, Travelers has saved over $30 million by doing more work in-house.    Mr. Yastrow of McDonald's says his company saves by using eight in-house paralegals to do research, collating, and photocopying at half the cost of outside firms' associates. In one eight-month trial, he says, using a paralegal saved $200,000. &quot;Why should we pay an associate to come to our office and go through our files?&quot; he asks.    ---                 The High Cost of Legal Services   How the average in-house law department spent its budget in 1987   Outside litigation services ...................... 29.4%   Attorney's compensation .......................... 28.0%   Other outside services ........................... 17.8%   Other expenses ................................... 15.8%   Staff compensation ...............................  9.0%   Source: Arthur Young andamp; Co., 1988 National Survey of Corporate Law Departments                Corporations' outside legal fees    Name                       Fortune 500     Outside    of                         Rank            Fees    Company                                    (in millions)    General Motors Corp.          1              $120.6    Chevron Corp.                11                53.0    Chrysler Corp.               10                50.0    Exxon Corp.*                  2                32.4    Du Pont Co.                   9                30.7    Atlantic Richfield Co.       18                21.2    Sun Co.                      43                12.0    LTV Corp.**                  56                10.7    Baxter International Inc.    66                 2.5   *Excludes payments to non-U.S. firms   **Fees include Chapter 11 proceedings   NOTE: Figures are for 1987.
