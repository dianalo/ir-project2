Western diplomats based in Islamabad said Moslem insurgents haveharassed departing Red Army convoys and overrun a string of basesdefended only by Afghan soldiers. Most of the bases are on theeastern border with Pakistan.   ``The regime has lost 18 district towns since mid-March, anunprecedented string of losses with tactical implications,''strengthening the belief that the Afghan army cannot fight theguerrillas alone, one diplomat said.   Soviet forces began their withdrawal May 15 under terms of anagreement signed April 14 in Geneva, and Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov hadsaid 25 percent of the 115,000 soldiers would be out by the end ofMay.   The sources quoted dispatches from their embassies in Kabul,capital of Afghanistan, as reporting only one Soviet combat unit onthe move in the past week, a 165-vehicle column consisting largelyof armor and artillery.   They had no figures on the number of soldiers who had crossedthe northern border into Soviet territory.   ``It is difficult to see how the 25 percent withdrawal thismonth, promised by Gromov, will be achieved,'' a diplomat said.   He said there were guerrilla attacks on the first Soviet unit toleave the country.   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in 1978and Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979.The guerrillas receive military aid from the United States, Chinaand other countries through Pakistan, where more than 3 millionAfghan refugees live in border camps and cities.   Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Soviet Union and United States signedthe Geneva agreement, which was mediated by the United Nations.   The guerrillas were not invited to the negotiations and saidthey would ignore the result, but well-known commander Ahmad ShahMasood is said to have agreed not to fire on the Soviets if theywithdraw peacefully. He controls a large portion of the mountainsand valleys north of Kabul.   Masood, who leads the Jamiat-i-Islami group, has made dealsbefore and always exacts a price. Diplomats said they did not knowwhat it was this time.   Senior Pakistani diplomats said Tuesday their government willpush during follow-up talks in Geneva this week for speedyformation of a transitional government in Kabul and faster Sovietwithdrawal.   ``Its time that something substantive is done to put together abroad-based ... government to ... prevent bloodsheed,'' said aForeign Ministry official, whose name was withheld in keeping withgovernment rules.   Reports from the Western diplomats indicate fighting in the pastweek was concentrated north and west of Kabul along the Sovietwithdrawal route, and in the eastern provinces near Pakistan.   Afghan forces also have evacuated some eastern military outpostsbut others have fallen to guerrilla attack.   No figures on prisoners have been released by the insurgentalliance's headquarters in Peshawar, Pakistan, but both guerrillasand diplomats say the number of Afghan soldiers defecting orsurrendering since the Soviet pullout began could be in thethousands.   Photographs taken at some captured army posts show large amountsof weapons, supplies and abandoned vehicles.   Control of the east also opens new supply routes for theguerrillas, who are slowly pushing toward Kabul. The border campsjust inside Pakistan serve as bases and supply points for theinsurgents.</TEXT></DOC>
