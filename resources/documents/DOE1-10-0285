The average grainsize R of the polycrystalline samples are obtained from SEM picturesand ranges from 0.7 to 2.78 {mu}m. So surface annihilation is expected.But the trend of I/sub 2/ with R is incompatible with Brandt model. Soit is concluded that Chevrel phase compounds are full of intrinsic defectssuch as channels. The second lifetime component tau/sub 2/ is attributedto channel trapping in Chevrel phase compounds. The estimated D/sub +//supapp/ lies within Brandt's detectability limit 2 x 10/sup -3/ to 0.2 cm/sup2//s. The progressive increase of {lambda}sub f/ with increase of Cuconcentration indicates that there is a charge transfer from Cu atomsto Mo/sub 6/ clusters. The enhanced values of {lambda}sub f/ for sulphidesreveals the formal charge reduction for selenides by 0.2 electron unitsin Chevrel phase compounds.</TEXT></DOC>
