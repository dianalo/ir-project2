The Frankfurt market was closed for a holiday.    Tokyo share prices firmed near the end of trading to close higher across a broad front. Investors continued to buy quality issues in various sectors, particularly major steel stocks, spurred on by a second consecutive day of substantial gains for New York stocks.    The Nikkei index gained 165.45 points to close at a record 27869.36. The previous record close was 27819.98 on May 17. In early trading today, the index was down 29.12 points, at 27,840.24.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index gained 12.38 to close at 2163.55. Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.9 billion shares, down from Wednesday's 2.56 billion shares.    The market eased during most of the afternoon session after the rally carried the Nikkei to 27841.30 at the end of the morning session. The Nikkei index fell during the afternoon to a level just 2 points above Wednesday's close, but surged back to its record close in the final half-hour.    Traders said the brokerages led the final charge, followed by trust banks and electricals. Steels, however, which were higher during the morning, didn't keep up with the rest of the market during the afternoon.    Most traders continued to insist, however, that plenty of interest in the major steels is waiting in the wings, and said the shares are in a position to lead the market during June.    &quot;Investors, including institutional investors, continued from yesterday to look for issues with good fundamentals,&quot; said one trader at a major Japanese brokerage.    Among brokerages, Nomura Securities rose 110 yen to close at 3,960 yen ($31.60), while Daiwa Securities rose 150 to 2,520, and Yamaichi Securities was 100 higher at 1,960.    Traders said electricals and trading houses got help from the firmer dollar. Toshiba surged 28 to 897, on volume of 110.3 million shares, while Oki Electric rose 13 to 899. Mitsubishi Electric was up 11 to 745.    One trader said heavy industrial and steel stocks fell back as trading slackened somewhat in the afternoon when institutional investors took profits and pulled back ahead of U.S. unemployment data for May due out Friday.    London share prices settled slightly better as the market rose late in the day after Wall Street erased some of its earlier losses.    The Financial Times 30-share index was 3.8 points better at 1443.4. Trading volume was a relatively moderate 516.2 million shares, compared with Wednesday's 440.3 million shares. The 100-share index stood at 1810.3, up 4.6 points.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 6.76 points at 2057.25 by the close of the London trading session, having been as much as 18 points lower at the New York opening.    But analysts noted that there was a dearth of news in the market to influence trading. &quot;There's just nothing to get excited about in this market,&quot; said Anthony Abrahams, managing director of U.K. equity trading at Smith New Court Ltd. in London, adding that &quot;there's only marginal movement&quot; in share prices.    &quot;There's a fundamental lack of information keeping a lid on activity,&quot; another dealer said.    But many analysts said it was encouraging that the 100-share index stayed above the critical 1800 level to settle at 1810.3. &quot;The index has broken higher and held convincingly above 1810, so it may feed upon itself and run higher in the next several days,&quot; one analyst said.    Only selected equities were affected after the Bank of England signaled a half-point rise in base rates to 8% from 7.5% around midday. The interest rate rise wasn't enough to lift the sinking pound, however.    &quot;All the stocks that should benefit from lower sterling are doing just that,&quot; said Mr. Abrahams. Others said the broader market was little affected by currency or interest rate factors.    Imperial Chemical Industries was the largest gainer on the day, leaping 19 pence to 994 ($18) on volume of 2.3 million shares. Glaxo Holdings, another international issue, ended unchanged at 918 on volume of 1.2 million shares. Dealers said Glaxo was still suffering from the downgrading it received last week from several brokerages.    Elsewhere, shares rose in Milan and Brussels, were mixed in Zurich and Amsterdam and lower in Paris and Stockholm.    Paris traders said technical factors caused share prices to close mostly lower after opening steady to narrowly higher. Market observers said the weakness in midsession partly reflected profit-taking on the gains recorded earlier this week. They described the downward adjustment as healthy in view of the exchange's 7.8% advance since the start of the current monthly trading account two weeks ago.    Stocks were higher in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei and Manila, mixed in Wellington and lower in Sydney and Seoul.    Sydney's decline broke a string of nine consecutive advances that pushed prices to their highest levels since October's collapse. Brokers said the selling echoed a general feeling that the &quot;market had gone too far, too fast.&quot;    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                   % This                                Jun 1    May 31    Year    U.S. ...................... 245.4     241.4   +  7.0    Britain ................... 540.5     534.9   +  4.8    Canada .................... 357.7     354.5   +  2.0    Japan .................... 1251.1    1236.1   + 22.4    France .................... 351.1     347.0   + 21.7    Germany ................... 170.0     167.7   +  8.6    Hong Kong ................ 1822.9    1807.2   + 10.9    Switzerland ............... 150.5     148.7   +  7.0    Australia ................. 316.2     312.2   + 21.9    World index ............... 453.8     448.2   + 11.2</TEXT></DOC>
