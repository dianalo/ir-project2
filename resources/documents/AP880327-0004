President Reagan has said the United States will not act like``a colossus of the North'' and take military action here. But thePanamanian Defense Forces say if the Americans do, theirU.S.-trained and supplied troops are ready to fight back.   ``The defense force is prepared,'' said Martin Paz, spokesmanfor the 15,000-man force under Noreiga's command.   Paz says the United States is aggravating tension between thetwo forces. Government-owned National Radio daily blasts the UnitedStates and warns of military aggression.   ``We are seeing a lot of maneuvers, maneuvers which do notcomply with the treaty,'' said Paz. ``It is my impression that theyare doing it to frighten us, to terrorize us.''   The United States wants Noriega, indicted by U.S. federal grandjuries on drug trafficking charges, to resign and is tightening theeconomic screws on the country in support of a citizen's campaignto oust the general.   The opposition hopes the Defense Forces will eventually turn ontheir discredited commander. Those hopes were raised Saturday whenbankers rejected a government demand for the $70 million remainingin their vaults and the cash-starved government was unable to makethe Defense Force payroll.   ``There are growing pockets in the defense forces that areagainst Noriega,'' said opposition leader Jose Mulino. ``But wedon't know if they will act.''   Panama is home to the U.S. Southern Command, headquarters forall U.S. military activity in Latin America.   About half the 10,000 U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy personnelare classified as combat troops. Their air backup includes Corsairfighters, Blackhawk helicopters and C-130 transport planes.   Although the Defense Forces, Panama's only armed authority,outnumbers the Americans, it has virtually no air force.   But the Defense Forces are not the ragtag affair they werebefore the 1977 treaty giving Panama sole control of the canal bythe year 2000.   Since 1981, the United States has spent more than $100 millionto make Panama capable of defending the canal alone. Militaryobservers say the Panamanian troops are increasingly effective,especially the new, 800-man Battallion 2000.   The Defense Forces carry U.S.-supplied M-16s and wear battledress uniforms virtually identical to the Americans. When theyhurled tear gas at striking dockworkers, the grenades were made inSaltsburg, Pa.   Enhancing the Defense Forces potential strength are paramilitarygroups loyal to Noriega.   Observers here believe the 25,000 automatic assault pistols theDefense Forces tried to buy in the United States this week were forthe paramilitary groups.   Noriega's former pilot, who recently fled Panama, has said that16 tons of Cuban arms were delivered to the mountains of Panama forthe general's last stand. Paz refused to comment on the defector'sclaim.   U.S. military aid to Panama was suspended by Congress last yearas the political situation began to deteriorate.   But under the treaty, U.S. and Panamanian military police stillpatrol together, stand side-by-side at the gates of shared basesand sit on boards that authorize troop movements around the canal.   ``There's a little tension,'' said one U.S. military policemanwho asked not to be identified. ``But we get along. We'reprofessionals with a job to do.''   Until recently they also carried out joint training exercises, apractice stepped up by Noriega after he took command in 1983.   Many Panamanian officers are graduates of the U.S. Army Schoolof the Americas, headquartered in Panama City until it moved toFort Benning, Ga., in 1984. Others trained at Fort Leavenworth. Oneclose Noriega aide is a graduate of West Point.   Noriega began a massive shake-up of his forces after a failedcoup on March 16. Paz scoffs at the idea of another, larger, moresuccessful mutiny and says only ``a few who wandered off thetrack'' were part of the abortive coup.   Osvaldo Velasquez, head of Panama's Human Rights Commission,said the dissidents are being harshly punished. He said 11 arrestedofficers have been tortured.   The Defense Forces have detained U.S. soldiers off their base atleast three times since the failed coup. U.S. officials haveordered military personnel and their dependents not to go to PanamaCity unless necessary.   Whatever happens to Noriega, U.S. military officials are worriedabout whether the Defense Forces and American troops can nowachieve the smooth transition aimed at having Panama take over thecanal in 12 years.</TEXT></DOC>
