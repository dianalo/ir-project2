The action, which was expected, was the 10th consecutive semiannual reduction since the agency adopted a variable lending rate in mid-1982, when the rate was set at 11.43%.    The new rate will be in effect during the second half of 1987 for payments on loans that borrowing countries have received from the agency since mid-1982. </TEXT></DOC>
