Poultry producer Perdue FarmsInc. recently estimated repetitive trauma disorders at its plantsat less than 1 percent.   And though OSHA contends Morrell knew conditions were causinginjuries but did nothing, company spokesman Raoul Baxter saidsafety-improvement efforts were being made and the agency reviewedrecords during an atypical time _ a period that included a strike.   In 11 months, records showed 880 of 2,000 workers sustainedrepetitive strain injuries. Baxter said there are no quick-fixprograms for such injuries. ``It's going to take a lot of hardwork,'' he said. ``Our progress has been dramatic.''   Morrell says injuries at Sioux Falls fell per 100 workers from70.5 in January 1988 to 13.48 in July 1989. Baxter attributed thehigh injury rate to the hiring of replacements and other strikeeffects; for the decline, he credited outside consultants, workersand supervisors.   But Jim Lyon, union local president, said he hasn't seen anysafety progress and said company numbers are ``totallyinaccurate.'' He also contends a program providing prizes forinjury-free records encourages people not to report them.   Morrell isn't the only meatpacker to come under governmentscrutiny.   OSHA also fined the nation's largest meatpacker, IBP Inc., but a$5.7 million penalty was reduced to $975,000 after the companyagreed to conduct a three-year safety program to reduce motioninjuries.   A recent workplace institute study of several large penaltiesfound OSHA had bargained fines down from $29.3 million to $9.5million.   And in cases where OSHA fines are smaller _ in the thousands ofdollars _ the agency ``is not effective in providing the stimulusemployers need to properly deal with safety and health,'' said JohnMoran, a former official of the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health. ``The bottom line in business is the dollarbill.''   OSHA's Zettler said his agency usually doesn't reduce penaltiesby more than half. In IBP's case, he said, ``we believe thesignificant reduction was justified by what we were getting back.''   Zettler also conceded OSHA doesn't have staff to inspect allhazardous places annually and it may cost more to comply than pay apenalty. ``If it takes us 15 years to get there, the guy has savedthat investment for 15 years,'' he said.   But he says his agency has increased safety awareness and mostmajor companies have health experts. Many also have hired safetydesign experts.   One is the University of Michigan's Center for Ergonomics.   Director Don Chaffin believes it's simplistic to blameproductivity alone for increased injuries and says corporations arepaying more attention to these concerns.   But one union local disagrees. At the Allegheny Ludlum Corp.,plant in Brackenridge, Pa., maintenance division injuries jumpedfrom 27 percent to 45-47 percent during four heavy overtime monthsin 1988, said Carol Mochak, USW local 1196's safety chairman.   ``People tend to overlook a lot of safety procedures,'' he said.``They're lax in wearing safety equipment. ... All they want to dois get the job done as quickly as possible.''   A spokesman for the specialty steelmaker said the company trieshard to limit overtime and has no serious safety problems.   Productivity also has been an issue in construction, said Moran,the former NIOSH official who now works at a firm that trainshazardous waste cleanup workers.   ``It's been getting worse for the last several years _ theeconomic pressures, the greater and greater emphasis on cuttingcosts,'' he said.   ``It's `Get it done faster.' If you're laying a pipeline, yousave money as a contractor by not putting in proper shielding orshoring in the trench.''   He said in 96 percent of trench cave-in deaths he studied atNIOSH, there was no shoring or sloping.   Shortcuts in the name of efficiency are ultimately uneconomical,said Berkowitz of the United Food and Commercial Workers. ``Anygains made by pushing people will be eaten up by high turnover andworker compensation.''   As for Kellen, he has agreed to a workers compensationsettlement of more than $16,600.   But he asks: ``What's the price on your hands? You've got toprovide for your family. There was a time when everybody thought ofretiring there after 30 years. I don't look for any future there atall. It's a sad deal.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday PMs, Oct. 23</NOTE></DOC>
