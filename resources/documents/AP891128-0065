(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal jury today grappled withracketeering charges against three radicals, one day after clearingthem of trying to overthrow the U.S. government.   The partial verdict acquitting the defendants of seditiousconspiracy Monday came on the 19th day of deliberations in theyearlong trial. The jury said it had not reached agreement on fiveother charges against the 1970s militants.   Prosecutors alleged the defendants, in their early 40s, weremembers of a terrorist group that plotted bombings and bankrobberies on the East Coast from 1976 to 1984 in a conspiracy totopple the U.S. government.   Two defendants, Raymond Levasseur and Richard Williams, alreadyare serving lengthy terms for convictions in connection with someof the bombings. Patricia Levasseur is free on bail after serving3{ years of a five-year term for harboring a fugitive, her husband,Raymond.   The partial verdict also cleared Mrs. Levasseur of racketeering.Yet to be decided were charges of racketeering against the two menand charges of racketeering conspiracy against all three. Eachcount carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and $20,000 in fines.   The jury may have had trouble accepting the prosecution'sargument that the little-known defendants were a serious threat tothe government, said Arthur Wolf, professor at Western New EnglandCollege of Law.   ``I think the government was really over-reaching frankly,''Wolf said.   An April 1976 bombing at the Suffolk County Courthouse left oneman with his leg severed below the knee, but many of the bombingsfailed because of ineptitude.   ``I can't help believing that when you're talking aboutseditious conspiracy that the jurors would take into account insome respect the inability to carry out the plan,'' Wolf said.   ``The fact is that conspiracy to overthrow the government byviolence is a ridiculous charge. The government had no right to useit,'' said Elizabeth Fink, a defense attorney.   ``These are very broad statutes,'' said Mrs. Levasseur. ``Peopleget convicted of these charges without ever leaving home.''   Prosecutors declined comment on the partial verdict.   The trial began in January after being moved from Boston; jurorsgot the case Nov. 6. Nearly 200 witnesses appeared and more than1,700 exhibits were introduced.   There were seven defendants at the time of the initial juryselection in March 1988, part of a band whose members sometimescalled themselves the United Freedom Front. Prosecutors droppedcharges against two defendants, a third pleaded guilty to seditionand other charges, and a separate trial was ordered for a fourth.   Prosecutors built their case around notebooks allegedly writtenby the defendants that the government charged provided a writtenrecord of meetings and plots.   But defense attorneys made light of the handwritten notebooks,with one lawyer saying they might be a ``memoir glorifyingrevolutionary action either real or wished for.''   Levasseur, who represented himself, delivered an intense speechexplaining his political evolution from his service in Vietnam inthe late 1960s, describing himself as ``a soldier that's still atwar.''   While he did not admit to any of the charges, he did speak abouthis desire to cry out against injustices in Central America andSouth Africa and said he had never betrayed his values.</TEXT></DOC>
