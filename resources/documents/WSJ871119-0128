The rating agency said last week that it had made a preliminary judgment on downgrading Bell Group. The agency hasn't publicly disclosed its final rating for the company, but the decision was leaked to some Australian newspapers yesterday.    The agency's triple-C rating is for companies judged to have &quot;potential uncertainties as to their capacity to meet debt obligations.&quot;    Share prices of Mr. Holmes a Court's companies have plunged as investors worry that the financier faces a cash squeeze. Bell Resources Ltd., whose major shareholder is Bell Group, earlier this week raised about 288 million Australian dollars ($200.7 million) by selling a 2.5% stake in Broken Hill Proprietary Co. to the Western Australian State Government Insurance Commission, which last week paid 206 million dollars for some of Mr. Holmes a Court's Perth properties. A senior Bell official, while denying that asset sales were necessary, has said that &quot;realistic&quot; offers would have to be considered. </TEXT></DOC>
