Mrs. Gramm, a senior White House budget official, was President Reagan's choice to serve out the remainder of former CFTC Chairwoman Susan Phillips's five-year term, which ends in April 1990.    Mrs. Gramm has vowed to fight any efforts to merge the agency with the Securities and Exchange Commission or to diminish its regulatory role.    The 43-year-old wife of Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) was confirmed by voice vote after Sen. Patrick Leahy (R., Vt.) told his colleagues that the CFTC needed the leadership of a permanent chief &quot;during this turbulent period in the markets.&quot; Commissioner Kalo Hineman has been acting chairman since July, following Ms. Phillips's resignation. </TEXT></DOC>
