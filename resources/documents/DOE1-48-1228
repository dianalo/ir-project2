However, it is magnetizable when it is used in magnetic field.As a consequence of magnetization it will receive magnetic body forceand disturb magnetic field configuration suitably designed for plasmaconfinement. The authors are concerned about a magnitude of the inducedmagnetic stress and range of disturbed magnetic field. Here the authorsanalysed induced magnetic induction and magnetic stress for two models(a beam-plate and a tube) and a first wall of a power reactor. They alsocarried out experiments to verify the computer code.</TEXT></DOC>
