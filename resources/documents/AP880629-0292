The ad campaign is being sponsored by Philip Morris Magazine,published by Philip Morris USA, which makes Marlboro, VirginiaSlims and Merit cigarettes.   The first ad, placed Tuesday in 19 daily newspapers across thecountry, carried the headline ``$1 trillion is too much financialpower to ignore.''   The figure is based on findings from the polling concern RoperOrganization which said it reflects the combined household incomeof the 55.8 million American smokers.   Roper interviewed a nationally-representative sample of 2,000people about a number of issues, including smoking habits, forPhilip Morris.   But Irving Rimer of the American Cancer Society said thecampaign ``left out the other half of the story and that issmoking's costs to the economy.''   Rimer said smoking costs the economy an estimated $65 billionannually in terms of lost productivity and treatment ofsmoking-related diseases.   The new campaign comes amid widening efforts to ban smoking inpublic places.   It also appears two weeks after a jury in Newark, N.J., heldanother cigarette maker, Liggett Group Inc., partly responsible fora smoker's lung cancer, the first such finding in 30 years. Thesame jury cleared Liggett, Philip Morris Inc. and another tobaccoconcern, Lorillard Inc., of conspiring to mislead the public aboutthe risks of smoking.   Guy L. Smith, publisher of Philip Morris Magazine, said thetiming of the ad campaign had nothing to do with publicity aboutthe verdict against Liggett.   He said subsequent ads will appear in about 30 trade magazinesover the next six months and point out what Roper found about thetravel, dining, shopping and entertainment habits of Americans whosmoke.   ``More than 24 million of this country's smokers will travelthis summer. Make room, America,'' one ad says. ``America's smokersattend enough sporting events each year to fill the Astrodome 3,200times,'' another ad states.   Smith said the ads are designed to reach leaders in a variety ofindustries to make them aware of how much money smokers spend.   ``The economic strength of this group has been overlooked orunderstated for far too long,'' Smith told a news conference.   He said one ad, indicating U.S. smokers own 35 million cars andbought more than 5 million new cars last year, was designed toreach automobile industry leaders. ``Enough cars to stretchbumper-to-bumper around the world four times is too much horsepowerto ignore,'' the ad states.   Smith said the auto industry was singled out because someopponents of smoking have reportedly suggested that automakersremove ash trays from cars.   ``We want automobile manufacturers, for instance, to at leastthink before taking action that will discriminate against a largesegment of their employees, their customers and their vendors,''Smith said. ``The time has come when smokers will not sit passivelyand have their rights trampled.''   The Cancer Society's Rimer the campaign demonstrates the tobaccoindustry is in trouble. ``They are trying to create an army out ofcigarette smokers who have no other connection ... I think they aredesperate,'' he said.   Separately, Philip Morris released results of a survey of thereaders of its magazine, and said they were generally above averagein terms of income, education and political activity.   Nearly three-fourths of the respondents said they smoked, Smithsaid.   Philip Morris put the four-page survey in the winter issue ofits magazine, which was mailed for free to 8.2 million households.More than 408,000 completed replies came back, Smith said.</TEXT></DOC>
