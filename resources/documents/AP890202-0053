Wednesday's announcement reverses a rebel stand that held U.S.personnel or property as legitimate targets because Washington hasgiven President Jose Napoleon Duarte's government about a milliondollars a day economic and military aid.   The insurgents last week offered to take part in presidentialelections if the vote were postponed from March 19 to September andtheir security concerns were met. It was a major turnabout for therebels, who had condemned all previous elections this decade asshams.   The government has reacted negatively to the proposal, which itterms unconstitutional. Even so, Duarte has said he is reservingfinal judgment.   The State Department said the proposal ``was worthy of seriousand substantive consideration'' and several U.S. lawmakers have saidit could be an important development in the search for an end to the9-year-old civil war.   On Oct. 27, guerrillas fired a rocket-propelled grenade at theU.S. Agency for International Development building in San Salvador.The house of a high-ranking U.S. diplomat was also the object of agrenade attack on Nov. 25.   No one was injured in either attack.   The insurgents issued a communique in Mexico City on Wednesdayannouncing an immediate suspension of attacks on U.S. targets. Aguerrilla spokesman called San Salvador radio stations, whichbroadcast the communique locally.   The statement says the suspension was motivated by ``the positivereception that our proposal has had in diverse sectors of NorthAmerican society.'' It also cited ``hope of a change in U.S.policy'' with the Bush administration.   The communique says U.S. military advisers based at Salvadoranmilitary installations are not covered by the suspension.   In another development, the mayor of El Salvador's fifth largestcity announced that he was resigning because of guerrilla threats.   Manuel Eliseo Perdomo of Usulatan joined about 80 other mayorswho have resigned since mid-December, when the guerrillas began acampaign of threats against them. The country has 262 mayoral posts.   Rebels killed nine mayors between March and November beforeadopting a policy of warnings. They consider the mayors instrumentsof the counterinsurgency plan of Duarte's Christian Democraticgovernment, the army and the United States.   However, in the election proposal, the rebels offered to respectthe mayors ``if they sever their links with the army's plans.''   The guerrillas' Radio Venceremos on Wednesday said rebels killedor wounded 851 soldiers in January. It did not break down the figure.   The armed forces press office said troops killed 120 guerrillasand wounded 115 during the month.   Neither side gave its own casualties. Figures from both sidesoften appear to be inflated.</TEXT></DOC>
