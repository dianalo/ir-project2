(DEC), IBMand Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) to buy equity shares of the Unix softwareproducer.andP;  They all have been longtime ATandamp;T adversaries.andM;ATandamp;T is a founding member of Unix International, a non-profit 165-memberorganization responsible for managing the growth of Unix System V.andP;  ATandamp;Tcompetitors--HP, DEC and IBM--are founders of OSF, a rival of UnixInternational.andM;Analysts also say potential sale of USL stock can mean unity within theindustry on Unix standards and development.andM;According to Chuck Barney, director of competitive analysis services forWorkGroup Technologies Inc., a market-research firm in Hampton, N.H., ATandamp;T'sUSL is expected to keep a 70 percent share and offer 30 percent.andP;  Accordingto Bob Herwick, senior technology analyst with consultant Hambrecht andamp; Quist,of San Francisco, ATandamp;T discussed potential sales of USL stock, but talksbroke down when issues of price and levels of control could not be agreedupon.andM;One workstation vendor and Unix proponent that seems pleased with theprospect of ATandamp;T's USL stock sale is Sun, partner with ATandamp;T in itsdevelopment of Unix System V release 4.0 last year.andM;&quot;It would be a renunciation of OSF,&quot; said Eric Schmidt, vice president ofSun's General Systems Group in Mountain View, Calif.andM;Speculation has arisen that ATandamp;T, which owns 19.1 percent of Sun's stock,will sell that stock due to a reported rift between the two firms after lastAugust's resignation of Robert Kavner, ATandamp;T's group executive for datasystems and federal systems, from Sun's board of directors.andM;&quot;Some people have speculated about a rift&quot; but that is not the case, saidJohn Skalko, spokesman for ATandamp;T Computer Systems, also in Morristown.andP;  Hedeclined to comment on whether ATandamp;T will sell its equity share in Sun.andM;&quot;From our perspective on the Unix side, we're very happy,&quot; said Dick Muldoon,spokesman for ATandamp;T's USL.andP;  &quot;We want to continue to work with Sun.&quot;andM;What these changing relationships boil down to is this: ATandamp;T and Sun appearto want to continue their relationship.andP;  Yet, ATandamp;T wants some independenceand is exploring new relationships with longtime rivals.andM;&quot;They're all going to continue to be competitors,&quot; said Robert Herwick,analyst with San Francisco investment bank Hambrecht andamp; Quist.andP;  &quot;This is not a'kiss and make up' thing.andP;  It is more of an 'OK, we've agreed on the rulesand now we're going to beat each other's brains out.'&quot;andM;Stay tuned....andO;</TEXT></DOC>
