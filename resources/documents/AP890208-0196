The secret witness told the panel that organized crime familiesalready run 12 of the 90 Indian gambling operations that he knowsabout. Fifty percent of the operations have some link to organizedcrime, usually through the purchase of supplies from Mafia-ownedcompanies, he said.   The man's wore a gray hood and testified behind a screen to hidehis identity. In addition, his voice was electronically altered.   ``The Indians need help,'' the witness told a specialinvestigative panel of the Senate Select Committee on IndianAffairs. ``Organized crime is destroying the reservations.''   The witness said he managed a bingo operation on a largereservation in the western United States for one of the majororganized crime families.   The witness disputed Anthony Daniels, deputy assistant directorof the criminal investigation for the FBI, who told the panel thatinfiltration of Indian gambling by organized crime is still fairlylimited.   ``The FBI is wrong,'' the witness said. ``They are not gettingthe right information from whatever source they are getting it.''   He said he knew from meetings with organized crime members andoperators of other Indian gaming operations that mob infiltration iswidespread and growing. ``In 10 years it will be totally out ofhand.''   He said he paid the chief $1,000 a week and employed most of thechief's family at the bingo hall, but added he didn't think thetribe knew he was working for organized the Mafia.   The Pittstown, Pa.-based Bufalino family, the New York City-basedLucchese family and the nationwide network set up by the late MeyerLansky are the organized crime groups which are most heavilyinvolved with Indian gambling, he said.   The witness, who said he has 25 years experience in gamblingoperations, said organized crime families set up businessmen, likehimself, as fronts to manage gaming on the reservations.   ``Great deals of money that should go to the tribe are taken outof the bingo hall,'' he said.   He said the mob skimmed at least $600,000 to $700,000 a year fromthe bingo operation, while the tribe received less than $100,000.   In mob-controlled gambling, the family usually owned the bingosupply company and sold non-existent or over-priced supplies to thereservation, he said. A Mafia-owned construction company would havebuilt the bingo hall, using overpriced material and labor and wouldoperate the food and gift concessions within the building.   Games would often be rigged so that an employee of the family wonprizes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, he said. Sometimesdrawings would be held for items such as expensive cars and a crimefamily member or employee would be assured of winning the prize.   Mob operations frequently used the bingo games to launder moneyfrom other illegal businesses, such as drug dealing, the witnesssaid.   He said he also knows that on some reservations, organized crimefamilies have set up laboratories to manufacture illegal drugs,although he didn't elaborate.   As bingo manager, he earned $2,500 a week, along with apercentage of the money skimmed off the operation and a percentageof the profits, the witness said.   When the witness was asked what would happen if he tried to run abingo operation separate from the mob, he answered, ``This committeewould be sending flowers to my family.''   The Bureau of Indian Affairs is useless in helping the Indians,he said. For example, when the FBI came to his reservation toinquire about the bingo operation, he simply told them to get offthe property and they did.   Organized crime families view Indian reservations they same waythey once looked at Cuba, he said. ``Wide open, no regulations, nocontrols.''   The solution, he said, is that ``a police force should be formedunder federal control that could supply the Indians with informationthey need (about the bingo managers) and could go in and look at thebooks.''   FBI agent Richard James Elroy, who has been assigned to thespecial Senate investigative committee for the last year, testifiedthat corruption is pervasive among Indian tribes in the UnitedStates, but often federal laws are inadequate to prosecutewrongdoers.   He acknowledged the sovereignty of Indian reservations and therestrictions on federal government intervention, comparing tribalgovernments to individual states or city governments.   But, he said prosecution is more difficult because, ``for somereason tribal governments are not included in the code for treatmentlike state governments would be.''   As for oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Elroy said theBIA ``is hamstrung.''   He said the relationship between the BIA and the tribes isintimate. He said he knew of three BIA directors who were removedwhen tribal leaders told Washington they wanted the director out.</TEXT></DOC>
