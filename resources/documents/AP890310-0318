Wall Street seemed to regard the growth as too vigorous, as stockprices fell on the Labor Department's announcement. Analysts citedconcerns the Federal Reserve Board may raise interest rates to cooldown the economy as employers bid up wage rates in anever-tightening labor market.   A record 62.9 percent of the working-age population was at worklast month, matching the high set in January, the department said indata calculated from its monthly household survey.   The jobless rate, stuck at 5.3 percent or 5.4 percent for fivemonths, fell 0.3 percentage point in February to 5.1 percent, itslowest since May 1974. The last time the rate was lower was inDecember 1973, when it hit 4.9 percent.   The gain of 289,000 nonfarm jobs in February reflected improvedconditions in service-producing industries, such as health care andretail trade, according to a separate survey of business payrolls.   February's job gains, although strong, were off from January'shuge increase of 415,000 jobs. Last month's harsh weather cut 22,000jobs from construction employment. Manufacturing jobs were down8,000 after rising steadily since September.   Those decreases were more than made up for by a gain of 321,000jobs in the service sector of the economy, including gains in healthand business services and in retail trade.   Many analysts had been expecting unemployment to be stagnant orlittle changed last month, developments Wall Street would have takenas a sign the economic expansion was slowing down.   Wall Street is concerned because the economy has shown few signsof flagging despite a yearlong campaign by the Federal Reserve todampen growth and restrain inflation by pushing up interest rates.   After Friday's report, some analysts expect further credittightening.   ``Any way you look at it, this is more strength than the Fed'sgoing to tolerate and that means interest rates will be headingup,'' said economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,Mass.   Daniel T. Van Dyke, senior economist at Bank of America in SanFrancisco, commented, ``We're adding jobs much faster than the laborforce is growing. ... The report portends more monetary tightening.''   Just last month, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the FederalReserve, said he had found recent price gains ``disturbing'' andlaid part of the blame on an acceleration in wage increases.   February's report, however, showed that seasonally adjustedaverage hourly earnings were up just 0.1 percent while averageweekly earnings declined 0.2 percent. Both categories had postedstrong gains during January.   Economist Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm,saw some underlying signs of economic weakness in the report,including the drop in manufacturing employment, a shortening of theaverage work week and steady overtime hours at factories.   ``I read this report as saying the economy is slowing down eventhough the so-called headline figures give the veneer of strength,''Evans said.   That interpretation was disputed by Jerry Jasinowski, chiefeconomist of the National Association of Manufacturers, who saidmanufacturing was strong except for autos.   ``Virtually all of manufacturing continues to report good ordersand pretty strong production,'' he said. ``All I get is reportsabout how strong orders and the economy are overall.''   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the drop in theunemployment rate good news.   ``Jobs are still the best barometer of a sound economy,'' hesaid. ``While the numbers are volatile on a monthly basis, theeconomy can continue to create jobs and inflation remain in check.''   Overall, the civilian labor force contracted by 247,000 peoplelast month to 123.2 million, while 142,000 workers found jobs.   The commissioner of the labor statistics, Janet L. Norwood, toldCongress that most of last month's jobless decrease was among youngadults and Hispanics, groups whose jobless rates tend to be erratic.   The jobless rate among whites was 4.3 percent, down from 4.6percent in January, while for blacks it was 11.9 percent, down from12 percent.   The jobless rate for Hispanics plunged to 6.8 percent from 8.4percent in January.   The rate for teen-agers dropped by 1.6 percentage points to 14.8percent, while the unemployment rate for young adults aged 20 to 24fell 1.2 points to 8.1 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
