MAGNUS solvesproblems of magnetostastics with nonlinear magnetic materials, permanentmagnets and electric currents, for any 3-D geometry. The two-scalar-potentialsformulation of magnetostatics used by MAGNUS combines numerical accuracyand computational efficiency, and is considered state of the art. Thewell known program KUBIK is used as a pre-processor to describe the geometryand finite element mesh. KUBIK is highly interactive and allows the userto effectively control all geometric details. The needs of magnetic engineers,however, go far beyond the simple availability of a mathematical solution.Once the solution has been obtained by MAGNUS in the form of a continuousmagnetic scalar potential function defined at every point in the solutiondomain, those needs are met by EPILOG. EPILOG is command operated. Commandsare independent of each other and can be used in any order, or not usedat all. The purpose of each command is to use the solution for the calculationof a derived quantity or the production of a plot or table. The followingderived quantities can be obtained: The magnetic energy in specific regions,the magnetic force on specified conductors in space, the magnetic torquein specified conductors, the magnetic flux across a given surface inspace, the inductance of a circuit, and a variety of line integrals forspecified lines in space. A useful facility is the automatic calculationof harmonic multipoles averaged along the beam direction for acceleratormagnets, essential for end analysis and the integral effect of the magneticfield on the beam.
