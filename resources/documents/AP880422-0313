(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Last August, Lotus Development Corp.chairman Jim P. Manzi exercised his options.   The 36-year-old head of the nation's leading software andpersonal computer maker bought 843,691 shares of company stock at aprice that realized a net value of $25,356,425, according tocompany reports.   Toss in his salary and bonuses, and Manzi made about $26.3million in 1987, outpacing Chrysler Corp. chairman Lee Iacocca byabout $8.4 million on a list of top-paid executives compiled byBusiness Week magazine.   Some Wall Street analysts say Manzi simply was shrewd to takeadvantage of a boom year for the computer company known for itsLotus 1-2-3 software. But when Manzi turned around and sold a hugechunk of stock six months later, he used the system to thedetriment of the average stockholder, they said.   ``I think if companies are going to issue the amount of optionsthat Lotus does, then management should be proud to be ashareholder in the company and not use the options to continuallycash in,'' said James M. Meyer, an analyst with Janney MontgomeryScott Inc.   Under the system of stock options, executives are given theopportunity to buy company stock at a set market price. They canexercise the option years afterward when the stock price may betrading above the option price.   They generally are used as incentives under the theory that ifan executive's performance rises, so will the company's value.   ``In general I root for these executives who get big paychecksfrom chasing in stock options,'' said Kevin J. Murphy, an economicsprofessor at the University of Rochester's William E. SimonBusiness School.   ``There has been a boom market that helps those firms a lot. Byfar the best measure of performance is the stock price.''   Manzi was given a lucrative package of compensation incentiveswhen he joined Lotus in 1983, a time when the company already wassucceeding. The former newspaper reporter became marketing directorand quickly rose to president in 1984.   He exercised his stock options in a year that saw Lotus stockjump 78 percent, ending the year at $30.75 a share on the New YorkStock Exchange. In February, Manzi said he sold 250,000 shares inorder to pay taxes on the options earnings.   Lotus defended the sales by Manzi and other executives, whichpreceded a drop in the company's earnings forecast and a delay in anew version of its popular 1-2-3 electronic spreadsheet program.   ``Jim Manzi is one of Lotus' largest shareholders andsubstantially all of the gains he realized in 1987 from stockoptions have been reinvested in the company,'' Robert Schechter,Lotus' chief financial officer, said in a statement.   ``His compensation ... reflects not just his 1987 compensation,but more accurately an amount earned over four years when hiscompensation package was assembled.''   Critics of stock options say that lucrative compensationpackages often give executives a free ride if the stock market isrising even if individual performance is sluggish.   And if a company's gains already are high, executives may try topreserve what they already have instead of investing anew, whichshareholders might prefer.   ``For very senior managements at the corporate level, stockoptions make lots of sense because what they do is link theinterests of top management with the owners of the firm,'' saidAlfred Rappaport, a Northwestern University accounting professor.   But he added that ``having lots of stock options doesn'tnecessarily make management as aggressive as shareholders wouldlike them to be in terms of ventures and new investments.''   As for Manzi's $941,000 cash earnings, analysts said they're notout of line _ even though Lotus is not a Fortune 500 company and itreported a net income of $72 million last year.   ``It's clearly a lot but (Lotus) has had some pretty spectacularperformances,'' said Gordon Wolf, vice president for executive paypractice at the New York consulting firm of Towers Perrin Forster andamp;Crosby. ``If you really believe that paper performance is what it'sabout, then when you make it you pay it.''</TEXT></DOC>
