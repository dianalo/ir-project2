The bank, owned by 152 countries, is the largest source of aidto the Third World. Its president, Barber Conable, and its largestcontributions come from the United States.   Most of its funds come from its borrowing on world markets.   The bank halted new loans to China in June after the governmentcracked down on the pro-democracy student movement, but itcontinued to disburse money on loans granted earlier.   Conable has said he hopes to resume new lending soon, but hasnot set a date.   Bush on Tuesday signed into law a bill that would make available$965 million for the International Development Association, a partof the bank that lends to the poorest countries. But the law saysthat $115 million of that will not be available until Jan. 1.   It also provides that the money will not be available thenunless the president certifies that any loans the bank makes toChina help the movement toward democracy.   The $965 million brings the United States up to date on itscontributions to the eighth replenishment of funds for the poorestcountries, known as ``IDA-VIII.'' That totaled $12.4 billion forthe three years ending next June.   Of 34 donors, the United States is the only one that has notagreed to a contribution to the ninth replenishment. If itcontinues to contribute 22 percent of the total, bank officialscalculated that Congress would have to appropriate $3.18 billion,which would be $300 million more than under IDA-VIII, for the nextthree-year period.   Conable said Monday that the Bush administration wants to askCongress for the money but is working out what its place in thefederal budget should be.   A meeting of representatives from the donor countries isscheduled for next month.</TEXT></DOC>
