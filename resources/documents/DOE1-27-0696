As such, design constraintshave led to a highly miniaturized system with each processor module performingbetter than the VAX 11/780. The small size, however, limits the &quot;standard&quot;peripherals available for use with the SANDAC V. It was felt that aninterface to a standard bus structured system, such as the VME system,would enable many tasks to be accomplished readily via a predefined interfaceas opposed to the need to implement special purpose interfaces for eachapplication. A standard VME bus repeater card, the Performance Technologies,Inc. PT-VME901 VME (rev. 124-000301) bus repeater, was selected as theactual interface into the VME chassis. This document describes the modificationsnecessary to that card, along with the interface developed at SandiaNational Laboratories for full functional capability.</TEXT></DOC>
