 Today, programmers often have to use a different set of languages,tools, editors and development procedures for each computer environment.andO;This makes it difficult to develop applications that can be run on a numberof computers without the need for redesign and reprogramming.andM;As a solution to this problem, IBM introduced Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA), which is an integrated computing environment supporting aCommon User Interface (CUA), Common Programming Interface (CPI) and CommonCommunications Support (CCS).andP;  The CPI permits users to develop applicationsthat are independent of the underlying system architecture.andP;  As shown in thegraph, the CPI includes a common set of high-level languages, procedurallanguages, application generators, expert systems, database interfaces,dialogue interfaces and communications interfaces.andP;  Applications thatconsistently use these services can run on any system supported by SAA.andM;The AS/400 will participate fully in the evolving SAA strategy.andP;  It willoffer SAA capability to midrange systems and will act as the control pointfor groups of intelligent workstations.andM;Application PackagesandM;Most applications for the AS/400 are in the form of application packages,which are not compliant with SAA.andP;  The AS/400 probably has the largest baseof software application products available on any commercial computer.andO;Although about 8,000 application packages have been developed for theSystem/3X and AS/400 environment, there are only a few hundred seriousapplication packages from well-established vendors.andP;  Most applications havebeen migrated from the AS/400's predecessors, the System/36 and System/38.andM;In addition to application packages, there are general-purpose applications,which include IBM's AS/400 Office and PC Support products, andgeneral-purpose application generators, such as Synon from Synon Ltd.,andO;Genesis V from Sofbro Ltd. of London, LANSA from Aspect Computing Pty.andP;  Ltd.andO;and Metaview from Metafile Information Systems Inc.andP;  These tools, describedbelow, are not compliant with SAA, although some are moving in thatdirection.andM;AS/400 Office.andP;  AS/400 Office is IBM's answer to the integrated officeproducts offered by Digital Equipment Corp., Wang Laboratories Inc. and DataGeneral Corp.andP;  It supports word processing, electronic mail, calendarmanagement and simple &quot;directories&quot; (or personal databases) in an integratedsoftware package.andP;  The initial version, announced in June 1988, is adequatefor its task but little more.andP;  A greatly improved version of SAA Office wasannounced in May.andM;Office automation was dead as a technological niche by the end of 1986.andP;  Inits place emerged a requirement to manage information exchange throughout theenterprise.andP;  Business information comes from a variety of sources and takes avariety of forms -- data, text, graphics, voice and image.andP;  The new officemust support these forms.andM;IBM ships AS/400 Office with every AS/400, offering customers a 90-day freetrial of the product.andM;Recently, IBM announced a major new office product.andP;  OfficeVision is designedto operate seamlessly across all SAA environments.andP;  OfficeVision supportsdocument preparation, filing, E-mail, decision support and calendarscheduling.andP;  The system is designed to provide integrated office functionsthat can be run on AS/400s, PCs and mainframes.andP;  Applications written usingthe CPI functions can be integrated into an OfficeVision system.andO;OfficeVision is expected to replace AS/400 Office as the primaryoffice-support package for the AS/400.andM;PC Support.andP;  PC Support is a PC connectivity tool introduced by IBM in 1984as part of its Office Systems Family of strategic office products for theSystem/36, System/38 and System/370-compatible mainframes.andP;  A much-enhancedversion of PC Support/38 was migrated to the AS/400.andM;PC Support has achieved nearly universal acceptance among System/36,System/38 and AS/400 users as the method of choice for integratingIBM-compatible microcomputers and IBM midrange systems.andP;  It offers one-stopshopping for most important connectivity functions, including terminalemulation, file transfer, file-server functions and printer-server functions.andM;Synon.andP;  Synon/2E is the most widely used and highly regarded computer-aidedsoftware engineering tool in the IBM midrange market today.andP;  It embraces boththe design and the generation of application programs in a top-down approachto application development.andP;  A data-modeling tool and an action-diagrameditor create high-level data models and function definitions that areindependent of implementation details.andP;  Predefined functions on data objectscan be assembled in a highly structured fashion using an action-diagramstructured programming notation.andM;These features accommodate rapid application development through successiveiterations of prototypes while maintaining design integrity.andP;  When the designprocess is complete, Synon/2E automatically generates corresponding RPG IIIor COBOL program source code, as well as the source code needed to createassociated AS/400 data objects.andM;A strategic move by Synon Ltd. is the decision to support IBM's SAA standardsin Synon/2E applications.andP;  But, Synon/2E's SAA support amounts to conformanceto CUA standards for keyboard usage and screen layouts.andM;Genesis V. Genesis V is an application generator developed for the System/38and later migrated to the AS/400 platform by Sofbro Ltd.andP;  The productautomates the generation of interactive RPG III programs based on a databasedefinition and functional specifications defined by the programmer.andP;  Uniqueamong AS/400 application generators, Genesis V uses rules in a knowledge baseto direct the translation of these specifications into RPG code.andM;LANSA.andP;  LANSA is a fourth-generation language (4GL) developed for theSystem/38 and modified to be suitable for use on the AS/400 by AspectComputing of Hawthorn, Victoria, in Australia.andP;  LANSA consists of an optionaldata-modeling module, a comprehensive data dictionary and a fourth-generationlanguage.andM;The LANSA 4GL is consistent with the AS/400 Command Language syntax andrelies on the AS/400 command-processing facilities to prompt for and validateLANSA command statements.andP;  LANSA statements generate RPG III code as well asdisplay screen and report data description specifications.andM;Metaview.andP;  Metaview is an application-development tool forcooperative-processing environments.andP;  It includes integrated support fordata, text and image information in a cooperative-processing environment.andP;  Italso has a high level of hardware independence, which is critical forcooperative processing.andM;A high-level instruction set defines a cooperative-processing architecture onwhich applications can be built.andP;  Metaview applications see this high-levelview of the network and treat it as a single &quot;soft machine,&quot; independent ofthe underlying details of operating system, hardware and networkconfiguration.andP;  It provides a striking endorsement of IBM's vision of thecooperative-processing environment.andM;In two weeks, I will begin a series on how to plan for the transition to anintegrated computing environment, such as IBM's SAA.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;  (800) 242-1240.andP;  For information on seminars, pleasecontact (in the United States and Canada) Technology Transfer Institute, 74110th St., Santa Monica, Calif.andP;  90402 (213) 394-8305.andP;  In Europe, contactSavant, 2 New St., Carnforth, Lancs., LA5 9BX United Kingdom (0524) 734 505.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
