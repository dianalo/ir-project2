The EPA proposed food-safety standards that would make it illegal to sell any food with detectable residues of Alar after May 31, 1991. Until then, it would still be legal to sell food with Alar residues, but only at lower levels than now permitted.    The change would primarily affect imported foods and any of this year's U.S. apple crop that was sprayed with Alar this summer.    The U.S. apple industry says the vast majority of growers stopped using Alar, a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier, after research linking it to increased cancer risks for children touched off an apple scare earlier this year.    Uniroyal Chemical Co., the Avery Inc. subsidiary that makes the pesticide known generically as daminozide, voluntarily halted Alar sales in the U.S. in June. However, it contends the pesticide is safe and still sells it in more than 70 other countries. Thus, environmentalists had feared Americans would still be exposed to cancer risks because of imported apples and other foods.    The EPA's proposal in effect would stop use of the chemical without formally banning it. It would gradually lower the allowable residue level on apples and such processed products as apple juice from the current 20 parts per million to five parts per million Nov. 30, one part per million in November 1990 and nothing by May 31, 1991. It would similarly phase out the levels permitted on other foods, including peanuts, cherries, nectarines, peaches, pears and grapes, although Alar isn't used much on those crops.    The Food and Drug Administration would be in charge of inspecting imported apples and banning shipments containing Alar. The FDA, though, has enough inspectors to check only a tiny percentage of imported food.    Almost all of the U.S. apple crop, which is just now being harvested, will probably meet the new EPA standards. Even if apple trees were sprayed with Alar this spring, before Uniroyal pulled its product, the residues at harvest would probably be less than the standard that would go into effect this November, the EPA said.    However, apples that were sprayed in the summer could have residues at harvest of 10 parts per million, which are too high. &quot;Any such summer use could result in treated apples being . . . subject to seizure,&quot; the EPA warned.    As a result of the EPA rules, expected to go into effect by November after 45 days for public comment, there will probably be a surge in food testing by states and grocery stores themselves, an EPA official predicted. More than a dozen states now test foods for safety, and grocery stores have increased tests for pesticides on food as a marketing device.    Al Meyerhoff, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which alerted the public with its report on Alar and children, complained that the EPA's action is still too slow and &quot;permits an unnecessary and serious cancer risk for up to another two years.&quot; The NRDC advocates an immediate ban on any detectable levels of Alar.    The EPA has been trying to ban the pesticide since 1985. Studies found that a breakdown product called UDMH, formed when Alar is digested or heated, causes liver tumors in rats and mice. It estimates that the chemical was sprayed on 5% to 15% of last year's apple crop, down from 40% in 1985. The EPA has no estimate of its use on this year's crop, although an EPA official said there is evidence that some U.S. apples were sprayed. </TEXT></DOC>
