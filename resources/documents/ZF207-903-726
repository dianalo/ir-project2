No.andP;  X servers running onDOS machines can provide a graphical windowing interface to any applicationthat is written to X specifications, no matter where the computation takesplace.andP;  [Ed.andP;  note: under X,  &quot;server&quot; and  client&quot; have slightly differentconnotations than on DOS and OS12 networks.]andM;An applications programming interface (API) is a specification whichdevelopers and prorammers write to in order to access and control theservices available to programs that adhere to that API.andP;  Essentially, an APIis a key to an environment which facilitates communication of one kind oranother.andP;  For example, the NetBIOS API permits peers on DOS networks to sendand receive program-level messages across a NetBIOS-compatible LAN.andM;The X Windows AP, not only Provides a means of communicating between networkpeers, but also provides a method of communicating wit i users.andP;  Supportingboth network communication and a common user interface are particularlyimportant for UNIX, which has rightfully acquired a reputation for beinginaccessible to all but the initiated.andP;  With X, UNIX, like DOS, will be tiedto a common user interface across vendor and processor lines.andP;  Plus, X is awindowing interface that supports graphics - not just the character-basedinteraction that has given UNIX a bad rep in all but the workstation market.andM;Technical workstations, like Suns and Apollos, have sported windowing userinterfaces for years.andP;  Unfortunately, each vendor has used a unique approach- one generally incompatible with its competitors.andP;  And little or no supportwas built-in for network-based windowing applications.andP;  You essentially hadto write your own system to translate between architectures if you went themultivendor route.andP;  Not an appetizing thought.andM;X provides a common intercommunication format sO applications need not worryabout display hardware and operating systems.andP;  The syntax for communicationbetween X application(s) and the interactive X window(s) is defined by the Xprotocol.andM;Applications that conform to the X API in order to provide user access arecalled &quot;clients.&quot; X clients, application programs and utilities that access Xdisplay services, can run on anything from an Amiga to an IBM mainframe.andM;Workstations, PCs or graphics terminals capable of providing user access tox-compatible applications are called  servers,&quot; i.e., they serve users.andO;Client applications and X servers are both tasks to an operating system.andP;  Amachine with a multitasking operating system, like UNIX, OS/2 or AmigaDOS,can simultaneously support X clients and X servers.andM;DOS-based PCs can only run a single client or server application because DOSis a single-tasking operating system.andP;  There is a growing number of DOSprograms that turn PCs into x servers.andP;  DOS-based X client software willprobably show uP at some point, but without the X user interface since it'sanother task.andP;  That's dedication.andM;The X standards also define a protocol for Inter-Client Communication so that&quot;the right window may know what the left window doeth.&quot; This standard couldmake it possible for desktop manager software (a client) to copy files acrossdifferent machines with incompatible file formats.andP;  It also enhances theprospects for distributed processing ap- plications development as itprovides a simple although high-level method of providing interprocesscommunication.andM;MIT, the official cradle of X, distributes a tape with a sample X serverwritten in C, which with little modification, compiles to run on a variety ofmachines - essentially any machine that supports a C compiler.andP;  Also includedon the tape is a library of routines th perform the very basic opera ionsthat define the range of potential X behavior, called Xlib.andM;Developing X applications with the Xlib would be like playing a song on 88different one key pianos.andP;  The Xtoolkit, defined by the Xt Intrinsicsstandard, lets developers deal with large chunks of the X programming puzzlein a modular way.andP;  Widgets are program chunks which are entities.andP;  Forexample, scroll bars and buttons can be defined as widgets.andP;  In the simplestcase a user might use an X builder, often called a screen painter, to grab,drag and assemble widgets into an application interface,andM;Making an application with a widget set and a builder greatly decreases thetime required for development.andP;  In one booth at Xhibition, Hewlett-Packarddemonstrated a technology (as distinguished from a product) in its builder,or UIMS.andP;  The person doing the demo assembled a program interface from readymade widgets in less than two minutes.andP;  A window with options offered in pulldown menus, and buttons, plus a scrollable edit area is a breeze to buildwith the right tools.andM;So just when will developers and software vendors be able to write theirUNIX-based applications one time and only one time? That's for the OpenSoftware Foundation and Unix international to figure out.andP;  But the hope fordeveloping application user interfaces just once looks nearer.andM;There are potentially 2,300 X applications that could come from Sunworkstation software developers, 1,600 from Tektronix, and at least a couplethousand from Hewlett-Packard/Apollo.andP;  Converting these existing applicationsto X is big job - but not impossible.andM;The number of potential new applications and new ports increases steadily asX grows and develops.andP;  MITX tape distribution grows bigger and bigger asprototypes and proposals for extensions to X come up for debate, review andstandardization or rejection.andP;  Already there are plans and means to add PHIGSand PHIGS+ 3D graphicsandM;as standards.andP;        Adobe's       DisplayandM;PostScript page description language is finding implementations and supportin X. Video too, will undoubtedly be standardized under X at some point.andM;At XhibitionandM;Xhibition  89 was the second annual gathering of people connected to X. Somecame to this conference and exhibition for the tutorials, others for thetechnical program.andP;  Some came for the vendor exhibits and others came toscout.andM;The unfortunate thing about conferences like Xhibition is that many seminarsessions run concurrently.andP;  That means you have to weigh your options.andO;Integrated Computer Solutions (Cambridge, MA), the X consulting and educationgroup who put on the show, dished out a robust and varied feast of Xinformation.andM;X-Compatible ApplicationsandM;X-compatible application software is just starting to appear.andP;  MostimpressiveandM;to    behold     and     experience   isandM;FrameMaker 1.3-X by Frame Technology (San Jose, CA).andP;  FrameMaker combines thefeatures of both a complete word processing package and a powerful desktoppublishing system.andP;  But it's better at both tasks than its DOS-based peers.andM;Workstations can do a whole lot more than a single-tasking DOS PC.andO;FrameMaker 1.3-X capitalizes on the potential of workstations and X windowsto offer incredible graphics presentation and handling, Yet the product isvery easy to use.andP;  If other X applications end up looking this good, UNIXwith X could very well grab a chunk of the networked PC market.andM;FrameMaker for X is already shipping for Sun, HP, Pyramid, Tektronix, Sonyand Apollo workstations.andP;  Versions for MIPS, Data General, DEC, SCO and IBMAIX are in development.andM;Elan Computer Group (Mountain View, CA) showed off two X-compatiblepublishing programs, one called EROFF and the other, Elan/Express.andP;  EROFFbuilds on troff, the standard UNIX markup language, to offer a publishingsystem, complete with laser printer drivers, page preview, graphicsinclusion, kerning, font management and native language support.andO;Elan/Express adds WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) to troff along withzoom-in, zoom-out, string search, a control panel, vitals on text andautomatic scaling to display format and size.andM;Although it is not an X application, Elan's ELM license management softwarecould be a handy program to have in a multi-user, X network environment.andM;To get the big picture in mapping, the little ones are important.andP;  DeLormeMapping's (Freeport, ME) XMap Integrator's Toolkit is a set of mappingfunctions, written in C, for the X Window System.andP;  The XMap toolkit letsprogrammers design applications that access the features of the DeLorme XMapIntegrated Geographic Manager and the XMap database.andP;  Zooming in from a viewof the earth to a floor plan is just one of the many Map-base handlingfeatures of this impressive package.andP;  XMap also has an SOL interface.andP;  XMap is suggestive of the power and flexibility of X in distributing access to avariety of data types.andP;  DeLorme is also publisher of the first world atlas onCD-ROM.andM;Mathematica  from      WolframandM;Research in Champaign, IL, is a system for doing mathematics by computer Itsupports X Windows on a number of machines, including HP 9000s, MIPS M/120,M/1000 and M/2000, several Silicon Graphics workstations, Sony NEWSworkstations and Sun 3s, 4s and 386i models.andP;  Fascinating 3-D plots weregenerated from equations entered by a friendly guide, demonstrating theandM;system's      postscript        renderingandM;capabilities.andM;Meta Software (Cambridge, MA) demonstrated an alpha version of its Design O/Agraphic applications development tool for X Windows.andP;  Design O/A is anapplication development shell for diagram-based relational graphics that letdevelopers build tools for CASE, systems design, structured analysis or anygraphical approach to systems modeling.andP;  Because Design O/A is an Xcompatibleprogram, any kind of machine on the network, as long as it runs an X server,can operate the program.andM;Visualization Workbench (VW) by Paragon Imaging (Lowell, MA) made apre-release appearance at Xhibition.andP;  Visualization Workbench wants to up theante in the CASE market by offering a more intuitive and a more automated wayof developing applications.andP;  Referred to as an imaging software system, VWintegrates image processing, graphics and human interface technology tofacilitate visual programming and automatic program generation.andP;  The factthat it uses X as the user interface delivery mechanism makes VW work in aheterogeneous network environment.andM;Finding the best time for a meeting can be difficult when more than twopeople are involved.andP;  Synchronize by Cross- Wind Technologies  Felton, CA) isa multi-user scheduling program that uses X to link users on all kinds ofdifferent machines.andP;  It is also a personal agenda.andP;  Synchronize brings toeveryone the kinds of features PC LAN users have had the exclusive on.andP;  Theprogram also has &quot;Work Diaries&quot; to keep track of your activities, &quot;To-Do&quot;task lists, and &quot;Pop- Up notes&quot; work like electronic Post-It notes.andM;Desktop ManagersandM;A desktop manager is not an executive standing on a desk.andP;  The Macintosh isknown for being the first system to popularize the idea of making a computerscreen resemble a desktop, complete with organizers and wastebaskets.andP;  Somedesktop environments, like Wang's new FreeStyle, go as far as simulatingpush-pins, staplers, and pencil and paper.andP;  X, being a desktop-like windowingenvironment, could use a bit of the organizing features found in the Mac andWang.andP;  Enter the X desktop managers.andM;All desktop managers use icons in one way or another.andP;  The differences indesktop managers is the ability to hierarchically iconify the layers ofinformation present in a system so as to render it easily useable.andP;  Files,folders or directories, print and communications resources, when handled asobjects, become easily accessible to users.andP;  This is the object and goal ofdesktop managers.andM;Open Look, the graphical user interface being espoused by Unix International,has its own file manager.andP;  ATandamp;T's Open Look file manager did its stuffbeautifully, but it only left me hungry for more desktop management features.andO;We'll probably have to continue looking to the third party and OEM markets toget full object-oriented desktop management services.andM;But the third parties are doing more than just waiting in the wings.andP;  IXI(Cambridge, England) has been shipping X.desktop for a while now.andP;  And thebig vendors are catching on.andP;  NCR and SCO are now offering X.desktop as ameans of managing their X offerings.andP;  X.desktop is distributed by Unipress inthe U.S.andP;  Originally a Mac interface look-alike, X.desktop offers much of thesame ease- of-use features found in the Mac, but with a different appearance.andO;The look-and-feel wars still rage.andM;Another desktop manager turning on UNIX vendors is Looking Glass by Visix(Arlington, VA).andP;  Interactive has chosen Looking Glass as the desktop managerto distribute with X for its 386/ix, UNIX-based operating system for386-based PCS.andP;  Looking Glass might just be the prettiest of the pack.andP;  Thedemo I saw at Xhibition quite impressed me, not only because of theaesthetics, but because of the features, like real-time task monitoring andquick command-line shells for standard UNIX operations.andP;  VISIX has afull-time artist on staff who does nothing but design wonderful icons.andM;Torch Technology (Cambridge, England), as well as making workstations and Xserver software, makes a desktop manager.andP;  Y-OpenTop, a name that doesn'texactly roll off your tongue, is Torch's iconic desktop manager for X.andM;WISh, by Non-Standard Logics  Paris, France) is an iconic UNIX shell for X.andO;Although I had a bit of trouble following the fellow demonstrating WIShandM;(he had a heavy accent), I h     no problemandM;seeing what he was thanks to the simplicity of WISH on a WIMP.andP;  A WIMP, as Idiscovered in their product literature, stands for Windows, icons, Mice andPointers.andM;SoftScience (Tucson, AZ) demonstrated a desktop manager called ConveniencePlus.andP;  Convenience Plus has the distinction of being available for an numberof natural languages.andP;  A feature called a Process Map displays a 3-D image ofprocess relationships, children and entry order.andP;  It also sports a number ofuser-to-UNIX interfacing features.andM;X ServersandM;Everybody sells an X server Most are ports of the X server included on theMIT X distribution tape.andP;  The X Server performs basic communication handlingand window drawing functions.andP;  Desktop managers and window managers run as Xclients.andP;  They make X easy, useful and pretty.andM;Besides just about every UNIX system vendor providing an X server for theirproduct, a number of independent vendors cater to the aftermarket audience.andO;Some enhance their products with development tools, others with performanceenhancements.andP;  There are quite a few servers specifically adapted to turn IBMPCs, ATs and PS/2s into either full time or part time X servers.andP;  There are acouple of versions for the Macintosh operating system (not Apple'sUNIX-alike, A/UX).andP;  And there is even a version for the Amiga.andP;  No doubt anAtari version will show up for the party.andM;For UNIX boxes, there are versions for the 386, Sun Workstations and a numberof other technical workstations, not to mention dedicated X terminals withservers in ROM memory.andM;Graphic Software Systems (Beaverton, OR) GSS*X386 is an X Windows developmentsystem that includes a server and tools to help programmers build X clientapplications on several 386 Unix platforms.andP;  Also included in the package area number of sample clients, like xclock, xcalendar and ico.andM;Torch Technology makes X servers for the Sun 3, 4,and 386i, as well as itsown machines.andP;  Torch, like its competitor GSS, distributes the Nutshell XlibGuides and an X Window System handbook.andM;Speeding Things UandM;Another approach to offering the X server involves loading and running the Xserver software on a special high-resolution graphics accelerator card, Afrequent engine for these aftermarket and OEM add-in boards is the Texasinstruments T134010 chip.andP;  it's amazing to see the difference in performancebetween an IBM RT running the X server in the host CPU and one running the Xserver in a graphics accelerator.andP;  It's night and day.andM;Advanced Graphics Engineering (San Diego, CA) announced a software packagethat allows OEMs and VARs to implement an X server on the T134010.andO;implementing the Xoftware T10 X server on the TI coprocessor reduces systemhost memory requirements for the server to only 512K bytes.andM;X-compatible               graphicsandM;coprocessors are available for a number of different machines.andP;  Some ofcompanies that make cards that can run X include Pixelworks (Hudson, NH),Microfield Graphics (Beaverton, OR), Matrox (Dorval, Quebec, Canada) andControl Systems (St Paul, MN).andP;  PC As X StationandM;X will not turn a PC into a workstation.andP;  But, in terms of from ending rawcomputation, there is no limit - because X let you put the power where youwant it and distribute access where you need it - cheaply.andP;  For graphicsintensive applications you'll want enough vector power and resolution to dothe job.andP;  This is where graphics accelerators are essential - even on aworkstation.andM;You don't need a workstation to support a million colors, 1024K by 1024Kresolution and fast drawing.andP;  Graphics cards are available that will make aPC AT look sharper and faster than most un- modified technical workstations.andO;However, chances are you all the graphics capabilities of a workstation or anenhanced PC.andP;  A regular AT with a EGA or VGA card might cover all the bases.andO;And you definitely won't be without a choice of X server software packages.andM;GSS, as well as making an X development system for 386-based versions ofUNIX, also makes a product called PC-Xview, which turns any DOS PC into an Xterminal.andP;  PC-Xsight by Locus (Inglewood, CA) is DOS-based X server that hasfound its way into SCO's OpenDesktop system interface under an OEM agreement.andM;PC-XVision by VisionWare (Leeds, England) is one of a couple of X serversthat make use of the Microsoft Windows environment.andP;  It permits DOSapplications and X clients to appear on the same screen, at the same time.andO;X11/AT by Integrated Inference Machines (San Diego, CA) is another X WindowsSystem server that uses the built-in features of Microsoft Windows to displayand manipulate X system clients.andP;  However, the company is better knownandM;in computing   circles for its super high-performanceandM;Inferstar 450e compute server which also supports X.andM;IBM PCs are not the only PCs out there able to peer in to heterogeneousnetworks via X. The Macintosh is supported by X server packages from bothApple (Cupertino, CA) and White Pine Software (Amherst, NH).andP;  MacX is theApple rendition and exodus is White Pine's solution.andP;  Both were up andrunning in demos in their respective booths.andM;Perhaps the most impressive PCtype X server runs neither on a Mac nor a IBMPC.andP;  GfxBase (Milpitas, CA) demonstrated Amiga X11.andP;  The Amiga, while ithasn't quite taken the country by storm, has none the less gained a steadyfollowing, particularly in the music and video industries.andP;  Highlighting theAmiga's multitasking and video handling strengths, the Amiga X11 demoincluded a color X session overlaid on top of full-motion video.andP;  Anotherscreen presented X with a twist.andP;  The Amiga monitor is really three monitorsin one - well sort of.andP;  By clicking and dragging on the screen title bar onecan pull up or push down any one of three screen views.andP;  And why shouldn'tusers be multitasking too? Under ConstructionandM;Some months ago I had the opportunity to review a distributed DBMS called VIADistributed Relational Environment.andP;  Included in the package was a wonderfulscreen painter.andP;  From then on I have sworn that the next time I get involvedin programming an application I would use one.andM;A screen painter, in its simplest form, allows you to set up screens withoutprogramming.andP;  You just take the mouse in hand and use a toolbox to createwindows, buttons and sliders by simply pointing and clicking the mouse.andP;  Theoutput of a good screen painter is application-useable code.andP;  Some screenpainters generate source code for each screen object, leaving it up to theuser to link them to the application.andP;  Others gather all the hooks andpresent them in a control panel affair that lets the user link them toprogram objects.andP;  Clearly the kind you use depends upon whether yourimplementation language is objectoriented or a more traditional code.andM;Some screen painters, while maintaining a simple-to-use object-oriented lookand feel, break down in the mesh between screen objects and program code -namely they put out an intermediate level of code.andP;  I am not sure whichsystem is best.andP;  I can't help being attracted to systems that put outstandard source code.andM;Most of the X screen painters, or builders as they are often called, are inthe pre-release stages.andP;  There are a few that have broken the ice early andthey all seem to fulfill the role of screen painter.andP;  Builders are a naturalfor X because of the barrier between X servers and X clients.andP;  By furtherpartitioning the development process into X- client-X-server communicationsand core program, application development is made less complicated.andP;  And ofcourse, much of the work is already done in the X server.andM;XFaceMaker, another X-compatible product of the Paris-based company NonStandard Logics, is a full-featured builder with menus that let you check offboth what you want and how you want to present it.andP;  TeleUSE by TeleLOGIC(Linkoping, Sweden) falls in to the category of User Interface ManagementSystem or UIMS.andP;  TeleUSE consists of four tools, a fairly typical screenpainter, a rule-based pseudo-language, an  Application Interface Manager&quot;that manages the links between the user interface and the program code, andthe  Ul-builder&quot; which pulls it all together.andM;X-Pression, by Unicad (Norfolk, VA) is another UIMS for the XWindow System.andO;X-Pression consists of three components, the UICompiler, the UI Server andthe UIMS Library.andP;  X-Pression users create two files, one of commands thatthe application expects to receive from the command queue and the other, afile that describe the exact appearance of the user interface.andP;  From thesetwo files the Ul compiler creates binary tables and  C&quot; language include filewhich are used at run time.andM;X TerminalsandM;Whether it be to extend t e usage of a workstation or to provide a window ona large heterogeneous computer network, X terminals can fill the bill.andP;  Theprice and performance range of X terminals covers everything from simple,inexpensive, PC-Iike products to super high resolution, workstation-processorequipped leviathans.andP;  Color is no problem either.andP;  One day sound video andother goodies will appear on X terminals.andP;  Who knows, X terminals mightreplace PCs, TVs and telephones.andM;Enough speculation.andP;  Today's X terminals fulfill the requirements of Xservers as defined by the X Window System standards established thus far.andO;And that includes a lot.andP;  One the high end, where everyone wants to be, yetfew can afford or justify, are products like the new NCD19, a terminal with amonochrome, 19 inch screen, powered by a Motorola 68020.andP;  Less formidable butno less important are low-cost X terminals by Dell Computers (A and AcerAmerica (San Jose, CA).andM;Human       Designed       SystemsandM;(Philadelphia, PA) and Tektronix  Wilsonville, OR) both have recentlyintroduced 19-inch, color X terminals.andP;  Tektronix is also reselling the NCD16by Network Computing Devices (Mountain View, CA).andP;  Visual Technology (Lowell,MA) presented its new 19-inch, monochrome X terminal.andP;  NCR was on hand withits 68020-based TowerView X terminal.andP;  GraphOn (San Jose,CA) makes an Xterminal that is designed for sharing a Sun workstation via RS-232 ports.andO;VideoandM;X and video is a good mix - at least theoretically.andP;  But some folks arealready doing it.andP;  Besides GfxBase's Amiga Xll overlaying X atop full screenvideo, it is possible to open and size X windows with video as content.andP;  Noneof the present X-compatible video packages as yet can readily scale a videoimage to the size of a window.andP;  They can pan over it and, if the video iscorrectly prepared, accomplish the needed shrinking and zooming before hand.andM;The creators of video systems for X view video on X as well suited totraining, tutoring, demonstrations and interactive video software.andP;  Picturean automated teller machine with a window that pops up with a live andfriendly face for on-line help.andP;  Such is just one of many possibleapplications for video on X.andM;The Sony Microsystems booth featured a Sony workstation running X with avideo window opened on the screen, showing flying scenes from Top Gun.andP;  Thevideo system was made by Parallax (Santa Clara,CA) who also had a booth atthe show.andP;  More Show GoodiesandM;The Xhibition  89 exhibition-wide network was an Ethernet with lots and lotsof goodies on tap.andP;  Workstation and X terminal vendors got to play aroundwith X-compatible client applications running on everything from Sunworkstations to IBM mainframes.andP;  The network, although not touted as such,was a working prototype for the network of the future.andP;  Interoperabilitynever had it so good.andM;Looking out on the floor you couldn't see the Ethernet cable dangling andsprawling all over the floor like at a regular &quot;network&quot; show.andP;  The cable wasunder the carpet, protected by rubber runners.andP;  But getting a view of theshow network wasn't hard.andP;  At least not in the Network General (MountainView, CA) booth.andP;  The Sniffer, as their network protocol analyzer is called,was taking a broad view of things.andP;  The Sniffer is wonderful.andP;  it watched whowas hogging the network and who was scarcely using it.andM;An interesting product that was demonstrated at the show really wasn't an Xproduct at all, even though it has an X in its name.andP;  XDOS, by Hunter Systems(Mountain View, CA) converts programs for the IBM PC into programs that rununder UNIX.andP;  You heard right.andP;  Instead of running a DOS emulator in UNIX andrunning DOS programs in side it, XDOS converts the PC program into a UNIXprogram.andP;  And for a huge performance increase too.andP;  And you get UNIX file andrecord locking.andP;  Sounds too good to be true, right.andP;  Hunter claims it workswith 1-2-3, DBASE III+, Word- Star, WordPerfect, MultiMate, MS Word and manymore.andM;Postscript is a page description language which defines algorithms for makingcharacters and graphics artwork.andP;  it was developed to improve desktoppublishing object manipulation and print output.andP;  It has migrated to thevideo monitor as Display Postscript.andP;  Display Postscript is to bit-mappedgraphics as X is to custom-made application interfaces.andP;  Essentially it makesa lot of things a lot easier.andP;  Adobe Systems (Mountain View, CA), the companythat started it all, was present at Xhibition  89, expounding the virtues ofDisplay PostScript and the extension to X that supports it.andM;Interactive (Santa Monica, CA) set out its wares for comparison against theannounced SCO Open Desktop product.andP;  Interactive's product line has beenfilled in to cover the areas where SCO proposes development.andP;  Interactive hasalready been shipping an XII package for some time now.andP;  EpilogueandM;Some vendors at the show treated X as merely a means of sharing aworkstation's CPU with a couple of machines capable of offering workstationquality display characteristics.andP;  This view seems narrow in light of therange of opportunities offered by X technology.andP;  In the extended workstationscenario, a couple of parasites share the often scarce CPU resources of ahost workstation.andM;The Internet, a vast network of computers covering the entire United Statesand linking university computer centers, defense contractors and researchcenters, is perhaps a better mo el for the future of X windows.andP;  As thprovides a mechanism for sharing information across a wide range on computersand locations, X can provide a window on a universe of computing, or at leastone on a corporate microcosm.andP;  When integrated Services Digital Network(ISDN) becomes generally available, with its high speed data and videocommunications links, X could be in its prime.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
