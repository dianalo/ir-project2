 Thisfixes many of the glitches found in the first Windows 3.0 release.andM;Additionally, there's an SDL (Supplemental Driver Library).andP;  This collectionof seven disks contains a lot of screen and printer drivers which weredeveloped after the release of Windows 3.0 itself.andP;  There are drivers for newprinters including the new LaserJet IIID, some SuperVGA cards, and newdrivers for Novell.andP;  Note that the driver for the DeskJet 500 isn't suppliedwith this set.andP;  It costs 100 pounds and is also available from Microsoft on(0734) 500741.andM;Windows 3.0 is the hot spot.andP;  Since the product was announced last May,Microsoft has shipped over 2 million copies of what has quickly become the PCworld's favourite graphical user interface.andP;  And since last May the pace hashardly slackened.andP;  Not a week goes by without new Windows products beingannounced -- from tiny icon packs right up to the mighty Lotus Notes, acompany-wide electronic information system.andP;  Those who aren't in Windows areeither kicking themselves -- like WordPerfect -- or turning predator -- likeWordStar and Lotus.andM;For users too, not everything in the Windows 3.0 garden is green.andP;  The morecopies in Windows 3.0 that ship, the more its quirks and inconsistencies cometo light; and the more we're all beginning to discover that behind theglamour and the glitter there's a story the suppliers don't want to tell.andM;In the pages that follow are:andM;* Explain the background to the Windows 3.0 saga and outline Microsoft'splans for future enhancements;andM;* Highlight the major deficiencies in some of the leading Windows products;andM;* Help to explain the clever technique that allows some companies to tour oldWindows applications as if they were now ones;andM;* Turn the spotlight on to the Windows 3.0 facilities these specially 'fixed'products can't use;andM;* Examine the bugs and limitations that flaw even the latest Windowsproducts;andM;* Explain how to get hold of important new driver disks and Windows products;andM;* And, in a unique experiment, put our concerns directly to Bill Gates, thehead of Microsoft.andM;It's strange how fashions change; less than a year ago Microsoft Windows wasnothing more than a sideshow, only supported by a handful of graphics-basedevangelists and derided by the rest as a means of making machines go slowerto no good purpose.andP;  Today, Windows 3.0 is, without doubt, the majordevelopment platform for PC software, and all those who backed it from thestart can congratulate themselves on their farsightedness.andM;However, the rapid adoption of Windows 3.0 by users and software developersshowed that there was strong pent-up demand for a PC-based graphical userinterface that actually worked properly.andP;  As soon as there was a version ofWindows that used the special features of the 80286 and 80386 to removememory constraints and run multiple MS-DOS programs in windows on the samescreen, its success was assured.andM;If Microsoft had left Windows the same for all but the user interface, thenits failure would have been equally certain.andP;  No amount of 3D buttons andcolour icons could have compensated for a failure to support the hardwarethat more and more users were buying.andM;So although Windows 3.0 works on any PC as long as it has an 80286 or 80386chip, it only really comes into its own on an 80386 or 80486 machine with atleast 4Mb memory.andP;  Then, in 386 Enhanced Mode, features like virtual memoryand multiple MS-DOS sessions make the most of all the processing power andphysical memory users have available.andM;Despite, all the hoopla that surrounded the launch, though, Windows 3.0 isn'tthe perfect platform that its most fervent converts sometimes pretend it is.andO;Underneath the new glossy surface is the same MS-DOS file and disk managerthat held up Windows 1.0 in more ways than one -- and by the standards ofother graphical user interfaces like the Macintosh and NextStep, that'sprimitive technology.andM;There are problems for developers in the way Microsoft moved the memorymanagement goalposts with the introduction of the DOS Protected ModeInterface (DPMI), and the way it's now introducing Object Linking andEmbedding (OLE) in its own applications at the same time as issuing thespecification to others.andP;  And then there are the many quirks that users needto learn if they want to optimise the way Windows works on their PCs, despitethe deceptive simplicity of the flashy new automated Setup procedure.andM;To its credit, Microsoft acknowledges all those criticisms and aims to fixmost of them as soon as it can.andP;  For example, MS-DOS 5.0, scheduled to shipsoon, will put right some of the memory management horrors of previousversions and will work much more neatly with Windows.andP;  The DPMI and OLEspecifications, along with development software kits, are now widespread andwidely understood by third-party developers.andP;  Windows itself is due for anupdate later this year, with TrueType outline fonts for screen and printerand a redesigned File Manager to make disk and file handling more intuitive.andO;And with many more manufacturers shipping Windows with their machines --some, like Dell, are even pre-installing it on PC hard disks -- the quirkproblem might be reduced, even though the variety of PC hardware availablemakes it impossible to cover every combination.andM;But all this, no matter how useful it will be in the short term, isinsignificant compared to the plans that Microsoft has now laid out for theevolution of Windows over a second five years of its life.andP;  Now that it hasaccepted the marketplace's verdict on OS/2 -- and with 300,000 copies sold inthree years, compared with more than 2 million copies of Windows 3.0 in oneyear, that verdict is clear -- Microsoft is planning instead to turn Windowsinto a full 32-bit multitasking environment on top of MS-DOS.andP;  And on top onthat, it will be building a 32-bit Windows application programming interface(API) into the forthcoming OS/2.3.x (sometimes called OS/2 NT, where the 'NT'stands for new technology').andM;This will go further than the Windows compatibility built into OS/2 2.0,which simply puts a translation layer between Windows programs and thePresentation Manager; in OS/2 NT, the first full 32-bit version of OS/2, theWindows API and the Presentation Manager API will be equally important, sothat developers can choose to use either without losing performance.andM;It's 32-bit Windows for MS-DOS that will really shape the way the environmentdevelops, and development kits for the new version are due to ship later thisyear.andP;  Win-32, as Microsoft calls it, will include better memory support toremove the current 16Mb RAM limit and offer up to 2GB per application; fullpre-emptive multi-tasking, with applications contending for processor time;multi-threading, to allow parallel execution of different parts of a program;an improved graphics toolkit with Bezier curves and device-independent coloursupport; and better networking and inter-process communications, includingpeer-to-peer 'named pipes'.andM;In other words, Win-32 will deliver most of what OS/2 delivers now, with theadvantage of running Windows 3.0 applications unchanged and making it easyfor developers to produce full Win-32 programs as the market demands them.andO;And the extensions currently being issued for Windows 3.0, like OLE,multi-media support and the Pen Windows stylus, interface, will all be builtinto Win-32.andP;  Microsoft's commitment to 'compound documents' using OLE, inwhich a document can be made up of components created by various applicationsand still linked with their 'parents,' will change the way applicationsdevelopers think and, inevitably, the way in which users work with theircomputers.andP;  Bill Gates has said that the applications, as such, willeventually disappear.andM;Against this background, the preferred scenario for software developers isclear; they should develop Windows 3.0 applications now, and forget aboutOS/2 and Presentation Manager completely.andP;  This approach maximises thepotential market, since any Windows 3.0 application will run unchanged underOS/2 2.0 and run unchanged and faster under OS/2 NT, as well as working withthe 70 million or so MS-DOS machines already in use.andM;It also maximises the future potential of the packages themselves, asdevelopers can move on to the full OS/2-style features of Win-32 at their ownpace.andP;  And competitive pressures will make that pace fast, bringing thebenefits of multi-threading to users for just about the first time.andP;  So far,even most OS/2 applications use multi-threading, because they're gonerallydeveloped across three platforms -- OS/2, Windows, and the Macintosh -- twoof which don't currently have multi-threading supportandM;This scenario explains the current flurry of activity among softwarecompanies, which believed the earliers stories told by Microsoft and IBM andfailed to enter the Windows market at all in favour of OS/2.andP;  Lotus, forexample, has bought two Windows software companies, Samna and cc:Mail, andhas accelerated its development of 1-2-3 for Windows.andP;  This should now shipthis autumn, after unprecedented trailers in the company's advertisements forAmi Professional.andM;WordStar has bought a source-code licence for NBI's Legacy word processor,and is selling an altered version under its own name.andP;  Software Publishinghad bought a similar licence for Samna's Ami word processor before the Lotusbuyout, and is now shipping an altered version called Professional Write Pluswhile working as fast as it can to transfer its Info Alliance 'data sourceintegrator' from OS/2 to Windows 3.0.andP;  WordPerfect has rejigged itsdevelopment schedule completely, putting the OS/2 version on the back-burnerin favour shipping the Windows version in a few months time.andP;  And Ashton-Tateis still showing odd versions of dBase IV for Windows without announcing it,while Borland had almost completed its switch from OS/2 and will launchParadox and Quattro Pro for Windows before too long, joining the new ObjectVision and Turbo Pascal Windows packages.andM;Whether traditional PC users like it or not, all the activity in softwaredevelopment is now aimed at getting Windows packages out.andP;  And that, finally,will put right one of the criticisms that can still be levelled at thepackage despite its dramatice sales figures: the lack of a wide choice ofmainstream applications.andP;  There are any number of software development aids,resource toolkits, user-programmable front-ends for networked databases and afew ports of Macintosh programs for such things as desktop publishing,business presentations and high-end graphics production.andP;  But there are onlya few word processors, often based on source code from just two companies,and only a couple of fully-fledged databases.andP;  Microsoft's Excel is stillchallenged only by Informix' Wingz -- although that should change by the endof this year -- and communications software is still in its infancy.andM;In a sense, Windows 3.0 needed to be a big success to take the environment tocritical mass, and to get software developers working on building up themainstream application base.andP;  In the classic vicious circle of softwarepublishing, a wide range of mainstream applications is normally required fora new environment to be a big success.andP;  Windows 3.0 broke that circle,proving that if something produces real benefits -- benefits that are obviousto users and developers alike -- then both producers and consumers ofsoftware can feed on each other's enthusiasm and get the band-wagon rolling.andO;From then onwards, as proved by the Macintosh, forward momentum and a growinginstalled base will do the rest naturally.andM;In its first year, Windows 3.0 has done enough to deserve its success, andMicrosoft has done enough to keep up the momentum over the next few years.andO;There are still problems, of course, with network and font installation muchtrickier than it should be, and obscure SYSTEM.INI entries like 'VirtualHDirQandequals; False' requiring users' attention when they should really be the concern ofthe operating system.andP;  But for most users with a typical Windows-based PC,running on 80386SX with 4Mb RAM and a VGA screen, the default Windows 3.0installation will work and all the new Windows applications will runsuccessfully.andM;And that, in the end, is what Microsoft wants.andP;  It wants as many users aspossible running Windows, running Windows applications from itself andothers, so that they can be led into the wider world of OS/2 NT, symmetricalmulti-processor support, integral networking, and distributed operatingsystem running on multiple hardare platforms.andP;  Windows promises to lead usersinto that world as gently and imperceptibly as possible, and in the long termthat will be seen as its major contribution to personal computing history.andM;In the meantime, as we shall see, there are still a number of day-to-dayproblems that are waiting to be tackled.andM;The Windows 2.xandM;versus Windows 3.0andM;debateandM;There's a large amount of name-brand Windows software on sale which -- to putit bluntly -- isn't all that it seems.andP;  This software is essentially Windows2.x code, which can't take advantage of the new system facilities in Windows3.0.andP;  Indeed, it's quite possible to re-issue your Windows 2.x program withonly superficial tweaking, and then plaster the box with labels proclaimingit to be 'Windows 3.0-compatibe'.andP;  And so it is.andP;  But there's a very cleardifference between 'Windows 3.0-compatible' software and 'Windows 3.0'software, as users are beginning to discover.andM;To discover why -- and how -- this has come about, we must look back brieftlyto the days of Windows 2.x programming, and see how programs are updated forthe Windows 3.0 environment.andM;It's a fact that almost all Windows developers seriously broke the rules whenwriting Windows 2.x software.andP;  Their excuse was quite reasonable: anythingthat improved operating performance was considered fair game, so theprogramming laws and rules clearly laid down in the Software Development Kit(SDK) were quickly cicumvented in the quest for higher performance.andO;Considering that the standard Windows platform two or three years agoconsisted of a 12MHz 286 machine, the developers had a valid point.andM;Some companies released 'Windows 3.0-compatibe' software well before theactual launch of Windows 3.0, to prevent the inevitable flood of irate userspanicking about why their software bombed out continuously under the new andimproved Windows system.andP;  An example of this is the release of Excel 2.1cearly last year: it slipped onto the market almost unnoticed, but was the'Windows 3.0-compatible' version.andP;  Actually trying to run the earlier versionunder Windows 3.0 protected mode was a pretty futile exercise.andM;Creating a WindowsandM;3.0 applicationandM;Taking an existing Windows 2.x application and rewriting it to run underWindows 3.0 can be a difficult experience, requiring considerable work if allthe new Windows 3.0 facilities are to be implemented.andM;The process is normally split into two separate phases: the first pahseconsists of making the Windows 2.x source code clean enough to run underprotected mode Windows 3.0, and the second phase consists of adding the newWindows 3.0 functionality.andM;Not surprisingly, most companies appear to be taking the second phase as anideal opportunity to add new enhanced program-specific functionality to theirprograms, so there's still a lot of software on sale which has only passedthrough the first phase.andP;  Well-known examples of thies include:andM;* Microsof Word for Windows 1.1andM;* Micrografx Designers 3.01andM;* Microsoft Project 1.0andM;* Bitstream FaceliftandM;* Z-Soft Type Foundry 1.5andM;The first phase of product updating is interesting, since it can result in aprogram which, although it may immediately appear to be a Windows 3.0program, is in actual fact a Windows 2.x application.andP;  To produce theapplication, the programmer cleans up the source code to remove thespeed-enhancing 'dirty tricks', and then recompiles and links with theWindows 2.x Software Development Kit.andM;This produces a Windows 2.x application which is safe to run under Windows3.0 in protected mode.andP;  However, if you try to run it, protected mdoe Windowswill still kick up a dialogue box warning that the application isn't aWindows 3.0 application, and that it's liable to crash.andP;  This is a sensiblewarning, because Windows 3.0 assumes that a Windows 2.x application willbreak the rules and thus violate the integrity of the protected mode system.andM;If the program is now 'clea', however, there's no reason to unnecessarilyalarm users, so developers can run a utility called MARK.EXE, supplied in theWindows 3.0 SDK (Software Developer's Kit) in the application's header toindicate to Windows 3.0 that the program is 'clean' and can be run underprotected mode without creating problems.andP;  When Windows 3.0 loads inprotected mode, it checks to see if the byte is set correctly -- if it is,you don't get the warning box.andM;This process creates a 'Windows 3.0-compatible' application.andP;  However, I'dstress that it isn't a full Windows 3.0 application.andP;  Not all of the newfunctions in Windows 3.0 are available to the application, because it hasbeen compiled with the Windows 2.x SDK, not the Windows 3.0 SDK.andM;There's more.andP;  A further facility in MARK.EXE is the setting of a byte whichindicates whether the application is proportional font-aware.andP;  Under Windows2.x, the system font as fixed pitch, and it was possible to align text indialogue boxes using spaces.andP;  Obviously, using the Windows 3.0 proportionalsystem font could wreak havoc.andP;  If the dialogue boxes have been designedcarefully, then it's possible to use the new proportional font, and Mark setsthe relevant byte to facilitate that.andM;This clever combination -- whereby you remove the Windows 3.0 protected modewarning and enable the system proportional font -- creates an applicationthat's very close in look and feel to a true Windows 3.0 program, and it'sdifficult at first glance to distinguish it from the real thing.andM;You can immediately tell, however, by examining the documentation suppliedwith the program: if it can be run under Windows 2.x, then it's a markedWindows 2.x application.andP;  True Windows 3.0 applications can't be run underWindows 2.x under any circumstances.andM;The new facilities in Windows 3.0 of most importance to users are the coloursupport, local printer support, the help system, enhanced memory facilitiesand the new networking facilities.andP;  In the near future, the Windows 3.0system will be enhanced to provide better sound and graphics in themultimedia extensions, there's the pen interface to come, and some wild newfacilities in the 32-bit Windows are due later this year.andM;So does it really matter if application is 'Windows 3.0-compatible' or a trueWindows 3.0 application?andM;Let's take some of those topics in turn, considering the followingapplications:andM;Real Windows 3.0andM;applicationsandM;* Microsoft Excel 3.0andM;* Corel Draw 2.0andM;Marked Windows 3.0andM;applicationsandM;* Micrografix Designer 3.01andM;* Microsoft Word fo Windows 1.1andM;* Microsoft Project 1.0andM;ColourandM;With the release of Windows 3.0, real colour support was finally provided.andO;If you're using a 256-colour VGA adaptor (or better), you might have noticedthat the Windows system will dynamically change the colour palette to bestfit the needs of the currently executing applications.andP;  It does this in anintelligent way: the foreground application gets first bite at the cherry,and the most recently used background application gets the next bite, and soon.andM;This ensures that the foreground application can display as many colours asit needs -- within the system limits -- and the background tasks muddle alongas best they can.andP;  As soon as you switch to another task, Windows sets up thepalette for that application, and on it goes.andP;  Because this palette supportis a new function call in the Windows 3.0 API (Application ProgrammingInterface), only real Windows 3.0 applications can use it.andM;If you're using a high-powered graphics drawing program, then you obviouslywant decent palette management which gives real colours on screen rather thanthe usual Windows dithered colours.andP;  Corel Draw Release 2, by being a realWindows 3.0 application, provides palette support, and it makes the screendisplay of colour much more convincing.andP;  Micrografx Designer 3.01 isrestricted to using the Windows colour dithering, and there's an obviousdegradation in screen quality.andM;Closer to the source, Microsoft claims that Excel 3.0 can support 16.7million colours.andM;It can't.andP;  Instead, it uses dithering even on 256 colour adaptor, and canactually work with only 17 colours simultaneously.andP;  In short, Excel 3.0doesn't use the Windows 3.0 system palette at all, and so compromises thescreen quality on those machines which can display lots of real colours.andM;HelpandM;All Windows programs should have on-line help, even if the program is totallyintuitive to use.andP;  The system-wide Help facility is a new feature of Windows3.0, and the facilities are provided in the Windows 3.0 SDK to createcontext-sensitive help reasonably easily.andM;Excel 3.0, by being a Windows 3.0 application, has a full Windows 3.0 helpsystem, but Word for Windows and Project have an earlier Windows Help systemdesigned for Windows 2.x/3 transitional products.andP;  Amazingly, Corel Draw 2.0doesn't have any on-line help at all in the main program!andM;Local printer supportandM;Any user of both Word for Windows and Excel 2.1 will be familiar with thetiresome routine required to change a worksheet from portrait to landscape.andO;To print a worksheet from Excel 2.1 in landscape, you had to dig around inthe printer setup box and reset the default paper orientation to landscape.andO;Almost immediately, Word for Windows would whinge that the paper orientationhad changed, leading to confusion.andP;  Surely you'd only changed the orientationin Excel?andM;The problem arises because under Windows 2.x there was only one printerdescription held in memory, and it was global to the whole system.andP;  If youchanged an entry in this description, then all the applications that wererunning at that particular moment were affected.andM;Under Windows 3.0, each application can have its own local printerdescription which it can modify to its heart's content without treading onthe toes of any of the other executing applications.andP;  This is obviously avery sensible new facility in Windows 3.0, but of course it's also onlyavailable to true Windows 3.0 applications.andM;This new facility in Excel 3.0 is obviously close to the hearts of most ofthe program's users, and at a recent demonstration, local printer supportreceived a heartfelt round of applause.andP;  Users of Word For Windows 1.1 arestill waiting for this facility.andM;Corel Draw 2, despite being a Windows 3.0 application, gives you the worst ofboth possible worlds.andP;  It quite happily lets you select landscape paperorientation when the system default is portrait, and you only find theconflict when you waste a sheet of paper printing out a page which containsonly half your drawing.andM;SummaryandM;It's a pity that some software manufacturers are taking so much time toupdate their Windows 3.0 software -- Micrografx Designer and MicrosoftProject haven't had an update for nearly a year.andM;Then again, it's particularly disappointing when a manufacturer releases amajor new upgrade only for us to find that it's still a marked Windows 2.xapplication: Z-Soft's Publisher's Type Foundry 1.5, released at the beginningof February, is a good example of that.andM;Let's hope that software manufacturers are hard at work bringing theirprograms fully into line with all the new features available in Windows 3.0.andO;They'd better be, because the system enhancements which will become availablein the com-available in the coming year will distance their software -- andtheir customers -- even further from the current 'state of the art'.andM;Bugs, limitations andandM;driversandM;Since the launch of Windows 3.0 last year, applications have been pouringonto the market.andP;  Some exhibit the craft and care associated with the latestin software technology, while others have perhaps got carried away in theheat of getting a product out early.andP;  Although there's a clear distinctionbetween a bug and a limitation (a bug is unintentional, a limitation isintended), from the user's perspective the result is often the same.andM;Microsoft Word forandM;Windows 1.0 and 1.1andM;The biggest howler in this otherwise excellent application is that it'sincapable of highlighting words in context if you're running in page mode.andO;This annoying problem manifests itself when searching/replacing and when youtry to run the spell checker.andP;  Apparently, the problem runs deep in the codeand is taking a considerable amount of fixing.andM;If you have the excellent Adobe PostScript Cartridge for the LaserJet II, youmay have noticed that multi-line cell entries in tables have had thedescenders chopped off the letters.andP;  The reason for this is that thecartridge is genuine PostScript, but Word for Windows maintains its ownprinter font table in the WINWORD.INI file.andM;If you change your installed printer fonts outside of Winword, it will refuseto 'see' them.andP;  The solution for this is to run File Printer Setup, highlightthe current printer and select OK: this forces Winword to update its owninternal font table.andM;If you modify your NORMAL.DOT file with a number of extra macros, there comesa time when the saving time for this file becomes catastrophically slow.andP;  Ona 20MHz 386, say, it takes over a minute to save NORMAL.DOT, and during thistime it appears to freeze.andP;  If this happens, don't reboot: just let Word forWindows contemplate its navel for a while until it finally decides it haswaited long enough.andM;Microsoft Excel 3.0andM;The main bug is that some macros brought into Excel 3.0 from Excel 2.0 don'ttranslate cleanly: for example, one of my Excel 2.1 macros, which appears tobe perfectly sanitary, just doesn't run correctly under Excel 3.0.andM;In addition, if you use Adobe Type Manager, you might have noticed thatrotated typefaces on the axes of 3D charts are positioned and displayedincorrectly.andM;Corel Draw 2.0andM;Despite the overall excellence of this product, the WFNBOSS fontimport/export program has a severely restricted Adobe Type 1 facility: fontsdon't translate cleanly, either going in or out.andM;Adobe Type ManagerandM;If you're using a PostScript printer, you'll have found that installing atypeface into the package doesn't update the PostScript printer's entry inWIN.INI.andP;  This has to be added in manually.andM;Microsoft ProjectandM;This program is hardwired to allow only 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 32 and40 point typefaces, irrespective of the capabilities of your printer or fontscaling package.andP;  It also has problems on 256-colour adaptors: when youiconise the application, it seems to grab the mouse focus, making itimpossible to double-click on the desktop.andM;Logitech AnselandM;The initial release of this scanning software had a number of glaringproblems, the funniest of which occurred when you selected the Help/Aboutbox: unfortunately, the program immediately crashed.andP;  A fixed version isavailable free from Logitech UK.andM;In addition, the program won't display more than 64 greyscales on-screen,even if your graphics card is capable of displaying 256 greyscales and youscanned with the '256 greyscales' setting selected.andM;Windows 3.0andM;The biggest flaw -- and one which has caused us considerable grief -- is thebug in File Manager.andP;  We found that this sometimes crashed for no apparentreason, locking up the whole machine and, on one occasion, caused hard diskdirectory damage which required a lot of sound reconstruction from NortonUtilities.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
