DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Miss America Bess Myerson was acquittedThursday of all charges in an alleged divorce-fixing scheme thatdefense attorneys branded ``a soap opera, not a criminal trial.''   The federal court jury also acquitted Miss Myerson's lover, Carl``Andy'' Capasso,'' 43, and former state Supreme Court JusticeHortense Gabel, 76, of all charges stemming from an alleged schemeto fix Capasso's alimony payments.   Miss Myerson, a former city Cultural Affairs commissioner, tookoff her glasses and wiped her eyes as jury forewoman Linda Berardiread the words ``not guilty'' for each of the five counts againstall three defendants and for a sixth count against Miss Myerson.   When the final acquittal was announced, a small cheer eruptedfrom the little group of the defendants' supporters, and Capassoembraced Miss Myerson.   Miss Myerson, 64, who was Miss America in 1945, walked the lengthof the defense table to embrace the frail retired judge.   ``I'm grateful for the American judicial system, and I thank thejury for exonerating me,'' Miss Myerson said outside the courthouse.   After a startling announcement by the jury that it had not yetreached a verdict on the key conspiracy count after almost four daysof deliberations, the judge re-read the instructions on reasonabledoubt, at the panel's request.   Within minutes, the jury sent out a note that it had reached averdict and overwhelmingly rejected the prosecution's contentionthat the three were guilty of conspiracy, mail fraud andbribe-related charges.   The jurors had been sequestered since Monday, when they beganweighing the evidence in the 12-week-old trial.   Miss Myerson was charged with trying to bribe the judge inCapasso's divorce case by giving a city job to the judge's daughter,Sukhreet Gabel.   Sukhreet Gabel sat with a dazed expression as each verdict wasdelivered.   Miss Myerson, Capasso, a onetime city contractor; and Mrs. Gabelwere charged with plotting to cut Capasso's temporary supportpayments to his estranged wife.   All three were charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and promotingbribery. Miss Myerson also was charged with obstruction of justicefor allegedly trying to influence the grand jury testimony ofSukhreet Gabel.   As the panel left the room, Myerson broke down, sobbing into herhands as Capasso massaged her neck and back. Capasso, before he wastaken back into custody by federal marshals, offered a one-wordopinion: ``Outstanding.'' The millionaire contractor pleaded guiltyto federal tax evasion charges in January and is serving athree-year sentence in Lewisburg, Pa.   ``The jurors were the most conscientious group I have ever seen.I feel just great,'' said Mrs. Gabel.   As her daughter congratulated her, the former judge said, ``Mydaughter is here and I'm glad she stood by me all the way. ... Shetold the truth all the way.''   ``Everybody's a winner, the truth came out,'' Sukhreet Gabel said.   Jay Goldberg, Capasso's lawyer, said, ``Had it not been BessMyerson, (U.S. Attorney Rudolph) Giuliani would have never broughtthis case.''   Giuliani, whose office has rarely lost a major case, praised thework of his staff and did not dispute the verdict.   ``I've never argued with a jury's verdict and will not do sohere,'' said Giuliani. ``The jury concluded there was insufficientevidence.''   Giuliani added, ``This case was a case that should have beentried, should have been brought to a jury. Obviously, we'redisappointed with the result.''   As for the testimony of Miss Gabel, who admitted her memory wasfaulty, Giuliani said, ``You don't have a chance to select yourwitnesses ... we were stuck with the witnesses existing in the case.I made a decision to go ahead.''</TEXT></DOC>
