Saturn is supposed to be a model of labor-managementcooperation for GM. But now, Saturn union members apparentlyare clashing with management as the unprofitable subsidiarytries to cut costs and boost production.</LP><TEXT>   Leaders of the United Auto Workers union local thatrepresents some 4,000 Saturn production workers recently senta letter to members declaring that negotiations toward a newlocal labor agreement are at &quot;a crisis point,&quot; and raisingthe possibility of a strike.   Meanwhile, GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel toured the Saturnplant earlier this month and was greeted by workers wearingblack and orange arm bands. The arm bands, according to anOct. 8 UAW newsletter, are a symbol of Saturn workers' dismayover &quot;the wrong direction of the quality audits.&quot;   &quot;The membership says that every time Saturn sends anotherdefect down the line, we're sending our job security down theline with it,&quot; the newsletter added.   The disagreements over the Saturn labor pact focus onproposals to curtail health benefits for certainlow-seniority Saturn retirees, limit overtime pay and holdSaturn pension benefits below levels for other GM workers,according to union officials.   Giving Saturn workers benefits equal to those for other GMhourly workers would add $173 to the cost of each Saturn car,the union's letter said. But the letter stops short ofcalling for &quot;drastic action&quot; such as a strike.

Asfor the arm bands, he said, those &quot;help to draw attention tofact that there is a commitment to quality.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
