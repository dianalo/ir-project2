Lou Guttman will celebrate hissecond anniversary as chairman of the New York MercantileExchange. While the exchange has posted impressive gains involume since he took office, some futures traders think Mr.Guttman and the exchange could be more aggressive in buildingtrading.   That's ironic because Mr. Guttman, a platinum trader, isdescribed as a street fighter by some exchange members. Andhe hasn't been accused of a lack of aggressiveness in hisfirst steps to reorganize the Merc.</LP><TEXT>   In July 1989, he and the Merc board engaged in a bitterfight with Rosemary McFadden, then the Merc's president. Thatbattle culminated in a 14-hour board meeting in which Ms.McFadden was forced to resign. Ms. McFadden was replaced byR. Patrick Thompson, one of the exchange's own executives.   At age 40, Mr. Guttman is the elder statesman of the majorfutures exchanges in New York. The Commodity Exchange'schairman, Martin Greenberg, took office in March of thisyear.   The Merc is the largest commodity exchange in New York andthe third biggest in the U.S., and the largest market in theworld for futures and options on crude oil, heating oil andgasoline.   The total volume of futures and options traded on the Mercin the first six months this year was up 31% from the similar1988 period -- before Mr. Guttman took office. This reflectsa world-wide surge in oil trading. However, some traderscomplain that the exchange has been losing more and morecrude oil trading business to off-exchange dealings.   Some traders say the growth in these dealings could havebeen slowed had the Merc gone more aggressively after thebusiness of large traders who typically work off the floor.They see some discontent among major oil producers with theway the exchange has catered to their needs. A long-timecrude oil trader at a sizable oil company says, &quot;The powerbase of the exchange is still one dominated by locals,&quot;independent floor traders who deal for their own accounts.   Marianne Hughes, vice president of Coastal Corp. and theonly Merc board member from a major oil firm, said shedoesn't believe that the exchange is indifferent to the oilindustry. It would be useful to have more oil-industry peopleon the Merc board, she said, but industry people arereluctant to seek the positions: &quot;Maybe they don't want tocommit the time, or their firms don't want them to put in thetime.&quot;   Mr. Guttman came to the U.S. from Hungary when he waseight years old and grew up in Brooklyn. He assumed the postof Merc chairman in August 1988 when the previous chairmanresigned. He was elected to a two-year term in March 1989.   Since that time, he has put in place his ownadministrative team. &quot;The last piece in the {reorganization}package was put into place in May when we succeeded in hiringBob Davis as senior vice president for planning anddevelopment,&quot; says Mr. Guttman. Mr. Davis had been a memberof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission since 1984. Mr.Guttman now says, &quot;For the first time in two years, it'sstarting to become a pleasure to be chairman of theexchange.&quot;   Little of Mr. Guttman's time today is spent on thegoings-on in the platinum pit, where he started at the Merc,though he still does some trading from his office. He is morelikely to be looking for another contract to follow thenatural gas contract introduced April 3.   It was the first successful launch by any futures marketof a nonfinancial contract in many years. Since the beginningof June, daily volume in natural gas has averaged more than500 contracts a day, while open interest (the number ofcontracts outstanding) has climbed to more than 5,000. Thecontract had been in the works for 10 years, but as oneformer Merc board member says, &quot;Lou finally got {thecontract} out the door.&quot;   The Merc is now working on a contract for so-called sourcrude, or high-sulfur oil. The exchange, however, has beencriticized for coming in third in the race to develop thiscontract. The Singapore International Monetary Exchangestarted trading a sour-crude contract within the past month,and the London-based International Petroleum Exchange willbegin trading one late this month.   Mr. Davis says the delay is due to the creation of acontract that permits physical delivery of oil by ship on theU.S. Gulf Coast. &quot;Physical delivery is more complicated thana cash-settled contract and requires detailed groundwork toestablish the delivery mechanism,&quot; he says. But he goes on topoint out that physical delivery provides a more reliableconvergence of futures prices to the cash market and seems tobe what the oil industry wants. The other two sour-crudecontracts are settled with cash payments.   Several former Merc board members agree that the fact theMerc probably won't be trading its contract before June 1991won't necessarily be fatal. One says, &quot;U.S. refiners willdefinitely use it if it's well-written, because it willreduce a lot of risk that the present futures contractpresents for sour crude.&quot;   Meanwhile, Mr. Guttman continues to handle the on-again,off-again discussions on merging New York futures exchanges.The only serious negotiations taking place now are betweenthe Merc and New York's second-largest futures exchange, theComex. Such a move should reduce costs and give the two moreclout in dealing with the two Chicago exchanges, which doabout 75% of the futures and options business in the U.S.   One former crude trader predicts that if the Merc &quot;comesout with a good sourcrude contract, then all the othercriticisms will be forgotten.&quot; The Merc still has whatamounts to a virtual monopoly on energy trading, and &quot;It'sawfully difficult to lose a monopoly,&quot; he says.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Crude oil prices slipped as production in Norwegianoffshore oil fields continued to return to normal. Wildcatstrikers at some operations are still refusing to return towork. But market participants have perceived that not enoughof the 1.6 million barrels of daily production from theNorwegian sector of the North Sea will be halted to helpwhittle down the largest overhang of inventories in eightyears. In addition, reports that Venezuelan officials areconsidering among themselves whether to request a higherquota from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesunnerved some traders. Such a request from the typicallyconservative cartel member could unleash a number of similarrequests from other OPEC producers, causing further chaos inthe market. Kuwait, which has been pumping beyond itsassigned quota for months, has also said that it wants agreater allotment. Despite lower crude oil prices, gasolineprices rose. A deadly explosion at an Arco Chemical Co. plantoutside Houston was one of the reasons. The plant makes amongother things 27,500 barrels a day of methyl tertiary butylether, an additive used in the production of no-leadgasoline.                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          Consumer resistance to rising bacon prices and mountingsupplies of frozen pork bellies are likely to continue topush pork belly futures prices lower, analysts said. Pricesfor bacon, which is made from pork bellies, average $1.57 apound across the U.S. and are as much as 20% higher than thatin many urban areas, compared with an average of $1.42 apound a year ago, said Charles Levitt, a futures analyst withShearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago. Prices for frozenpork bellies have declined in recent days, mainly because ofsluggish retail demand, analysts said. On Friday, pork bellyfutures for delivery this month fell the daily limit of twocents a pound to close at 54.17 cents a pound on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange. Traders are expecting figures due outafter the close of trading tomorrow to show that frozen porkbelly supplies are mounting in warehouses around Chicago, onthe basis of lower-than-expected shipments to processors.                                                                                                          Cotton                                                                                                          Futures prices continued to decline at the end of theweek, with the October and December contracts falling twocents a pound -- their daily limits -- to 78.74 cents and73.62 cents, respectively. The July contract closed 1.36cents lower at 91.44 cents a pound. This week will see theexpiration today of the July contract. Ed Whitten, cottonspecialist at Balfour Maclaine Futures in New York, said heexpects the contract to expire without any &quot;fireworks.&quot; Thereis one large Memphis, Tenn., cotton merchant holding most ofthe previously purchased contracts, and it is widely believedthat this merchant sold a few contracts Thursday and Fridayto reduce pressure on the market. Cooler weather with someprecipitation was forecast for parts of the Texas coast, butMr. Whitten said it wouldn't be enough to help the crop. Hesaid support for the October contract should be initiallyfelt around 78 cents a pound, with stronger support between75 and 76 cents. He expects significant support for Decembercotton at about 71 cents. Resistance to higher prices can beexpected at recently set life-of-contract highs. &quot;I wouldlook for a continued sell-off early in the week with arecovery later in the week,&quot; Mr. Whitten said. &quot;It alldepends on what the {commodity} funds do. They dominate themarket now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
