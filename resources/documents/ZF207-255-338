GrossmanandM;SAN JOSE, Calif.andP;  -- Developers and users attending Apple's worldwidedevelopers' conference here last week gave the firm's new Macintosh operatingsystem high marks, but acknowledged that the transition could be lengthy.andM;Although existing applications will be able to take advantage of featuressuch as virtual memory, outline fonts and the new print architecture, newapplications will have to be written and current software revised beforeusers can realize the full potential of the operating system.andM;Long-awaited features in release 7.0 include a ''live-link'' capability,which connects cut-and-paste documents so that updates to one file areautomatically reflected in another, and scalable fonts, which allow flexiblesizing and provide better-quality output, especially on non-standard outputdevices such as facsimile machines and film recorders.andM;Release 7.0, which will require 2M bytes of RAM, will also include virtualmemory, standards for interprogram communications, remote database access,32-bit addressing, a layout manager, a new print architecture and a moreconsistent Finder interface.andM;Current software will run on the new operating system only if developers haverigidly followed Apple Computer Inc.'s specifications for writing 32-bitapplications, said officials of the Cupertino, Calif., company.andM;Most developers at the conference said they have been working on making theirsoftware 32-bit compatible since Apple's introduction of its 32-bit Unixoperating system, A/UX.andM;''Our current analysis is that we're not going to have any difficulty makingthe changes for A/UX, so that would mean that we're 32-bit clean,'' saidRichard Sorkin, a product manager for Ashton-Tate's Mac division in San Jose.andM;Fully exploiting the new operating system, however, requires rewriting.andP;  ''Ifyou want to take advantage of the new things [in System 7.0], then you haveto drastically change your software,'' said Art Schumer, a program managerwith Microsoft Corp.'s Macintosh applications group, in Redmond, Wash.andM;Because Apple doesn't want to support two separate operating systems, companyofficials said, it will encourage all current users to move to System 7.0,which industry sources expect to be released in the first quarter of nextyear.andM;Users will also have to plan a transition from System 6.03 to System 7.0.andO;''[Our company] has 7,000 Apples, and only a fraction have 2M bytes or more.andO;.  .  .  For most users, 1M byte has been able to run quite nicely for mostthings,'' said a senior systems engineer for a large aerospace firm.andM;The engineer said that his firm will likely take a wait-and-see attitudeuntil there were clear advantages to switching over.andM;''Initially I don't know if it buys us anything to move to System 7.0 untilapplication developers write software that takes advantage of it,'' he said.andM;Because Apple is planning to ship System 7.0 even with its entry-levelsystems, Apple officials said, the firm is considering several combinationsof RAM, ROM, processors and hard disks to allow a computer to run the systemsoftware without 2M bytes of RAM.andM;If users decide to stay with the current operating-system releaseindefinitely, software vendors will be faced with the prospect of having tooffer updates for their System 6.03 software in addition to coming out withSystem 7.0 versions, developers said.andP;  ''We're going to run into a verysimilar scene to what we've got in the PC world where we have OS/2 and DOS.andO;.  .  .  You're not sure which environment to program for,'' said Microsoft'sSchumer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
