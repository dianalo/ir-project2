Since the latter half of the same year, the oil prices havedropped sharply and in association with this, concern about energy savingand alternative energy has cooled down rapidly in Japan too. In thisarticle, it is examined whether or not geothermal energy, particularlyhot springs most expected as the alternative energy resource in Japan,the country with the largest geothermal resources in the world, can competewith oil in terms of thermal cost under the above circumstances. Accordingto this article, in 1987, the thermal cost of A heavy oil is about 4yen/MCal and that of kerosene for house heating is 5.55 yen/MCal, accordinglythe thermal cost of geothermy is seemed to be below one half of thatof A heavy oil demonstrating enough its economy for the practical use.Consequently, it emphasises the necessity of the effective exploitationof geothermal energy in a local scale.
