A statement delivered to a Western news agency said Washingtonwould not take ``realistic steps'' to end the ordeal of the 14foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, nine of whom are Americans. Itsaid President Reagan was like ``the ostrich that hides her head inthe sand so that the hunter will not see her.''   The typewritten statement in Arabic signed by Islamic Jihad, aShiite Moslem group loyal to Iran, was in a sealed envelope with ablurry instant photograph of Anderson, the longest-held captive.   It was the 14th photograph released of Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent of The Associated Press, since his abductionMarch 16, 1985. He is shown with a mustache, wearing glasses and awhite T-shirt.   He is behind a two-tier birthday cake with candles and appearsready to cut into it. Oct. 27 was Anderson's 41st birthday, hisfourth in captivity.   The picture apparently was made before a videotape releasedMonday, in which Anderson said Reagan and Vice President George Bushhad not done enough to win his release.   Anderson was clean-shaven in the videotape, in which he said thedate was Sunday.   Islamic Jihad, Arabic for Islamic Holy War, also says it holdsThomas Sutherland, 56, acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut, who was kidnapped June 9, 1985.   It said in the statement delivered Friday: ``The only safe way tothe freedom of the captives and their safety is the implementationof our just demands. This is the essential cornerstone in thisissue, nothing else.''   No demands were given, but the group has said in the past thatIsrael must free Arab prisoners and withdraw from a ``securityzone'' it maintains in south Lebanon.   Another demand previously made is the release of 17 peopleconvicted and held in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and Frenchembassies Dec. 3, 1983.   Friday's document said the release of hostages is not connectedwith a truce that began Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf warbetween Iran and Iraq.   ``It has been also said that the cease-fire in the gulf willspeed up the release of the captives,'' it said. ``We repeat for athousandth time that the issue of the captives altogether is not inany way linked to what happens in the gulf. Failure to free thehostages is a result of the American heresy, procrastination andreneging on pledges and promises.''   The statement denied Reagan's assertion that the kidnappersforced Anderson to read the videotaped statement, in which thejournalist accused Washington of interfering to stop his release. Healso said Reagan and Bush negotiated with terrorists in theIran-Contra affair and the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner toBeirut.   Reagan denied bargaining with terrorists and said: ``I don'tthink that was Terry speaking, I think he had a script that wasgiven to him.''   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said: ``Anytime youhave people being held hostage, tapes, letters, those kinds ofthings are by definition under duress,'' he said.   Bush denied involvement in Iran-Contra or negotiations with theTWA hijackers, who held 39 Americans for 17 days and killed a U.S.Navy diver. Israel released more than 700 Arab prisoners after thehijackers freed the Americans, but denied a link.   On Friday, Islamic Jihad said: ``The videotape, irrespective ofits contents, has been issued directly by Terry Anderson without anypressure. ... The tape was made after sharp exchanges between himand us about all the ideas he introduced, which we considered verylacking.''   The hostages ``are not isolated from the outside world,'' itsaid. ``They see and hear the news from newspapers, magazines andtelevision stations. They are aware of everything that happened orwill happen about their situation.   Hostages released previously reported having limited access tonews reports.   Anderson ``will make an adequate answer'' to Reagan and Bush, thestatement said, but did not say when.   Islamic Jihad accused the Reagan administration of ``cheating,lying and misleading the American people and the families of thehostages to head off any pressure on the American government toembark upon realistic steps to resolve the question of thehostages.''</TEXT></DOC>
