The agreement, if ratified by the union's membership,would make Burlington Northern the first railroad to reach acrew-size agreement with the UTU after the conclusion of aspecial review board last month. The review board, which wasan outgrowth of congressional action that ended a one-daynationwide rail strike in April, had upheld therecommendations of a presidential emergency board to shedmany of the rail industry's remaining work-rule restrictions.</LP><TEXT>   Burlington Northern, a Fort Worth, Texas, rail holdingcompany, said that it is too early to estimate how many jobswould be reduced as a result of the agreement. But JamesDagnon, senior vice president, human resources, of BurlingtonNorthern Railroad, said the agreement was a breakthroughbecause it was reached voluntarily without the need forbinding arbitration.   &quot;The presidential emergency board recommended that bothparties sit down at the bargaining table locally andnegotiate a crew-size agreement in good faith, and that'sjust what we did,&quot; Mr. Dagnon said.   The emergency board had ordered that the tough issue ofcrew sizes continue to be negotiated locally, but thatarbitration settle disputes that drag on.   Mr. Dagnon said that the agreement would allow BurlingtonNorthern to reduce crew sizes, which typically range fromthree or four people in the southern part of its railroad, byone or two on many trains. The southern tier extends southfrom the Denver area to the Texas Gulf Coast and east to anumber of Midwest cities. He said the railroad would offerone-time separation payments of $60,000 to surplus train crewmembers who elect to leave the company. Surplus train crewmembers who decide to stay with the railroad would be put onreserve-board status entitling them to health and welfarecoverage and 75% of their pay.   Train crew members on the reserve board would be free togo to school or work at other jobs, he said, until they arerecalled to work on the railroad.   Analysts said they were encouraged by the agreement atBurlington Northern, which has lagged behind the railroadindustry in reaching local agreements to cut crew sizes.&quot;Burlington Northern has had less productive work rules,&quot;said Anthony Hatch, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. But underthe agreement &quot;they will at least catch up to the rest of therailroad industry in productivity.&quot;   However, the agreement with the UTU doesn't include crewson the railroad's northern tier, which extends fromWashington state to Minnesota and has been marked by largercrew sizes and more acrimonious labor-management relations.</TEXT></DOC>
