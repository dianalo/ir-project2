Census Bureau specialists Barbara Boyle Torrey and W. WardKingkade report that in both superpower nations, the rate ofpopulation growth is slowing, and the rate of labor forcegrowth is slowing even more. Writing in Science magazine,they note that the U.S. population, which increased at anannual rate of 1.1% in the 1970s, will grow only 0.7% a yearin the 1990s and only 0.5% annually in the first decade ofthe 21st century. Over the same period, the Soviet annualgrowth rate will have dropped to 0.7% from 0.9%.   In both countries, the proportion of older people isincreasing sharply; the Soviet Union, long demographicallyyounger than the U.S., is now one of the world'sfastest-aging countries. The share of the U.S. population 65and over will swell to almost 14% by 2010 from 9.8% in 1970.Oldsters will account for 11.8% of the population in theU.S.S.R in 2010, up from 7.9% in 1970.   Since Americans can get Social Security as early as 62 andSoviet women can retire at 55 and Soviet men at 60, thepension-age population will bulk even larger. By 2010, almostone out of six Americans and almost one out of five Sovietswill have reached retirement age.   Naturally there are important demographic differences aswell. Life expectancy has been increasing in the U.S. butdropped in the Soviet Union during the 1970s. And while thefertility rate in both countries has remained relativelystable in recent years -- around 1.8 or 1.9 children perwoman in the U.S. and around 2.3 or 2.4 in the Soviet Union-- the disparity among ethnic groups is far greater among theSoviets. In 1988, the U.S. fertility rate ranged from 1.7 forwhite women to 2.7 for Hispanics. But the Soviet Union'scentral Asian nationalities had fertility rates double thoseof the country's European and Caucasian ethnic groups.                                                                                                          Part-Time Work Is Fine,   If It's What You Want                                                                                                          ARE PART-TIME jobs good ones or bad ones? It all depends,says a new analysis.   Part-time employment has grown slowly over most of thepost-war period; more than 15% of all adults in non-farmcivilian jobs work less than 35 hours a week. Aboutone-fourth of all working women and not quite 9% of allemployed men are part-timers. Most work part-timevoluntarily, but one out of four female part-timers andbetter than two out of five male part-timers do so becausethey can't get full-time work.   Part-time jobs are usually thought of as bad jobs, withlow wages and few fringe benefits. But in a contribution to aBrookings Institution volume titled &quot;A Future of Lousy Jobs?&quot;Northwestern University economist Rebecca Blank discoversthat although part-time hourly wages do average less thanfull-time wages, the difference isn't all that great -- notquite 8% less for women and 6% for men. She also findsparticular types of work -- many professional and managerialjobs, for example -- where part-timers get even slightlybetter hourly wages than full-timers with similarqualifications.   There are marked differences, however, in fringe benefits.Ms. Blank reports that part-timers are only one-third toone-half as likely as full-timers to have all-importanthealth insurance or pension-plan coverage.   The overall conclusion: Because most part-timers workfewer hours voluntarily, they presumably have personalreasons that offset the negatives, and thus for them,part-time work isn't too bad a deal. For part-timers whocan't find full-time jobs or single heads of familiesprevented from working full-time because of child-careresponsibilities, a part-time job is indeed a bad one.                                                                                                          Nursing Homes Factor   Into More Futures                                                                                                          NURSING-HOME stays loom large for future oldsters.   Christopher Murtaugh and colleagues at the federalgovernment's Agency for Health Care Policy and Researchfigure that more than half the women and almost one-third ofthe men turning 65 this year will spend time in a nursinghome before they die. Assuming average risks for each spouse,seven out of 10 couples now reaching 65 can expect at leastone partner to use a nursing home sometime before dying.   The researchers base their estimates on a study of a largesample of individuals dying between mid-1982 and mid-1984.More than one-third had been in nursing homes at some pointafter reaching 65. Not surprisingly, the older the dyingperson, the greater the likelihood of a nursing home stay,due partly to the longer life but also the increasingprobability of chronic illness as the person aged.   &quot;Because individuals now turning 65 have a longerlife-expectancy than the persons studied, they face a stillhigher remaining lifetime risk of nursing home use,&quot; theresearchers explain. In the sample studied, women were almosttwice as likely as men to have been in a nursing home, andwhites far more likely than blacks.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          SEATTLE IS the best city in North America for bicycling,the editors of Bicycling magazine conclude, based on readers'nominations. Two California cities -- Palo Alto and San Diego-- are next best, while New York City, Orlando and Pittsburghare the cyclists' top horror spots. . . . An increasingnumber of men and women in their 30s and 40s are enteringsocial work, making a career change for altruistic reasons,according to Richard Edwards, a dean at Case Western ReserveUniversity in Cleveland.</TEXT></DOC>
