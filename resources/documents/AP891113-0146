Baker on Mondaysaid Soviet action in Central America and Cuba ``has been thebiggest obstacle'' to that country's achieving better relationswith the United States.   Baker blamed the Soviet Union for aiding El Salvadoranguerrillas in their bloody offensive.   ``The Soviet Union bears a special responsibility because itsarms and money, moving through Cuba and Nicaragua, continue tosupport violence, destruction and war,'' Baker said in an addressbefore the Organization of American States. ``Shipments of sovietrocket-propelled grenades to the FMLN are incompatible with the newthinking.''   He added, ``Soviet behavior toward Cuba and Central Americaremains the biggest obstacle to a full across the board imporvementin relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.''   Baker joined other administration officials in condeming what hecalled ``acts of terror'' by the leftist Salvadoran guerrillas,known as the FMLN. Hundreds of people have been killed in the smallCentral American nation in the fighting that began over the weekend.   ``It's a very difficult situation with this very large andorganized and clearly calculated offensive under way,'' White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``And while it is being handled,it certainly represents an escalation of the attacks from anythingwe've seen in recent months.''   ``The president stands with the freely-elected government of ElSalvador in condemning this senseless violence,'' he said.   Fitzwater said El Salvador's president, Alfredo Cristiani, hadnot asked for assistance to quell the fighting, the heaviest sincea 1981 offensive by the Marxist-led rebels. He said he would notrule out U.S. involvement, adding: ``We can never predict thefuture. But at this point, it's not anticipated.''   The United States provides El Salvador with about $1.5 million aday in economic and military aid. Fifty-five American militaryadvisers are assigned to train the Salvadoran troops but are notsupposed to take part in field operations.   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher saidChristopher Babcock of Spokane, Wash., was killed Sunday when hewas hit in the head by a grenade fragment. He was a teacher at theAmerican School in San Salvador, the capital.   Fitzwater cited reports of recent arms shipments to the rebelsfrom the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, adding: ``The latestattacks show that much more of the Sandinista arms designed todestabilize and overthrow the legitimate government of El Salvadorhave been getting through.''   At the Organization of American States, Nicaraguan ForeignMinister Miguel D'Escoto introduced a resolution Monday calling foran urgent appeal to the Salvadoran government ``to ceaseimmediately the bombing of the civilian population'' and other actsof repression.   The rebels launched the offensive Sunday after pulling out ofpeace talks to protest a series of attacks on leftist political andunion leaders, which they blamed on the U.S.-backed government.Cristiani, whose official residence was attacked, declared a stateof siege, rescinding basic civil liberties and imposing a 6 p.m. to6 a.m. curfew nationwide.   Boucher defended the move, saying: ``The imposition of a stateof siege of limited duration by the government, we believe, is aresponsible measure to protect civilians from the FMLN's (FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front) latest campaign of terror.''   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., the chairman of the foreignoperations subcommittee, said Cristiani's rightist governmentshould move with caution.   ``They should be very careful that they not fall back into thepatterns that held the government in disrepute in the firstplace,'' he said, adding that his criticizm of the administration'shandling of El Salvador has been justified.   ``I have been critical of the administration for giving an all'swell attitude down there,'' Leahy said. ``And in view of the eventsthis weekend, it's not.''   Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif., said the guerrilla offensiveshowed the rebels ``are obviously desperate'' and defendedCristiani's suspension of civil rights by saying: ``I think we'd doexactly the same thing if rebels were attacking Washington, D.C.''   The spokesman said about 1,500 guerrillas infiltrated into SanSalvador for the attack and that fighting in the capital causedsignificant civilian casualties. There have been attacks in othercities and on armed forces brigade headquarters in outlyingprovinces.   Boucher said there were ``indications in the past that somethinglike this might happen.''   U.S. Embassy personell and their dependants were staying closeto home, he said. The American School was closed. The Pentagondeclined to comment on whether the military advisers assigned tooutlying bases had been recalled to the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
