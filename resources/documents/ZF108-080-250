 The outward signs, such as plannedsatellite launches, forecasts for geographic systems, venture and start-upactivity, all indicated growth.andM;But inhibitors were still lurking, and they were substantial:andM;* Hardware prices dropping as fast or faster than unit shipments wereincreasing;andM;* Curtailment of oil exploration in the wake of the oil industry slump;andM;* Missionary-level selling required to get new applications developed,tested, and accepted in land-use planning, real estate development,transportation mapping, and agriculture management (among others);andM;* Curtailment of government spending, in both the commercialization of theLandsat program and in the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI); andandM;* Lack of assurance that revenue growth would be accompanied by profits.andM;InhibitorsandM;slow growthandM;Alas, it looks like the market's inhibitors have been more powerful than theenablers.andP;  Venerable market forecaster Dataquest (San Jose) sees 10% averagecompound growth for the remote sensing piece of the earth sciences graphicshardware pie (boards and special equipment only, not digitizers, scanners,plotters, software, or services), but for the market as a whole forecastsnonexistent growth from last year to this.andM;Meanwhile the signs of stress abound.andP;  The current Landsat satellites servingthe imaging crowd and run by EOSAT, the company set up to take Landsatprivate, are past their planned lives now; replacement birds aren't plannedto be sent aloft until mid-1991.andP;  SPOT Image Corporation, the U.S.andP;  sales armof the French company that owns the SPOT system, will replace its satellitewith another this month, but many of the launch plans of other countries andcompanies have been delayed.andM;Two key issuesandM;Two main issues block achievement of more substantial double-digit growth forthe market:andM;(1) high costs of digitizing old images to plug into geographic informationsystems and use in concert with newly-produced digital images, andandM;(2) absence of high market demand driving new application development.andM;&quot;For the long term I'm bullish,&quot; notes Clyde Spencer, a senior analyst withDataquest, &quot;but there's this never-ending problem of converting oldphotographic or aerial imagery for use in updated systems.andP;  Scanning anddigitizing with today's technology is just too expensive.andP;  Falling hardwareprices mean that a 26% growth in unit shipments, as we chart for the earthsciences sector in 1989, means only 11% revenue growth.&quot;andM;In the meantime, aerial photography has developed new techniques of its own-- digital image capture and scanning -- which help it maintain presencewithout achieving dominance.andP;  Thus the age-old competition between theinexpensive but lower resolution digital images from satellites and thehigher resolution but expensive images from aerial photography continues.andO;The resulting balance seems to depress margins without increasing the overallmarket.andM;Growth awaitsandM;new applicationsandM;The old remote sensing community has now lived through the privatization ofLandsat and the start-up of SPOT; new growth will have to come from newapplications.andP;  While several third party firms take satellite image data andprocess it in various ways for end users, those firms alone won't be the onesto write new applications for new audiences.andM;In an attempt to prod the market for its satellite data, SPOT Image beganmarketing its own canned software and data packages in the Innovative MappingSeries of products.andM;The SPOT QuadMap product, for instance, puts USGS 1:24,000 quad maps intodigital or photographic form using fresh data: current quad maps can be up to20 years old.andM;One of the drags on the market, notes Dataquest's Spencer, is itsfragmentation.andP;  The top five vendors (see accompanying graphic) account forless than 30% of the overall market.andP;  What's more, the vendors -- AldenElectronics, Gound IDG (now Vicom), Interactive Imaging Systems, Comtal-3M,and Matrox Electronic Systems -- all tend to have areas of specialization.andO;Nor, according to Spencer, are there enough software suppliers to jar theindustry into growth through competition.andM;Hardware baseandM;broadensandM;But the applications are coming.andP;  &quot;One of the trends we notice,&quot; says Dr. RoyWelch, Director of the Center for Remote Sensing and Mapping Services at theUniversity of Georgia, &quot;is the use of PCs to do what had to be done withlarger systems before.andP;  We've found ways, for instance, to use PCs to workwith stereoscopic data, in essence putting images into 3D.&quot;andP;  Welch, in fact,has begun marketing that software through ERDAS.andM;To support this trend for PC-based applications, by the way, both SPOT andEOSAT now make data available on floppy disk.andP;  For that matter, the marketfor satellite data has almost entirely migrated to electronic rather thanphotographic images.andP;  In 1985 60% of EOSAT's Landsat data was sent out indigital form; by 1987 that percentage had risen to 80%.andP;  It must be evenhigher today.andM;This irony of this quiet period in the market is the increasing importance ofdata collected from satellites and other space sources.andP;  The real-time fly-byof Neptune by Explorer, the increased worry over the Antarctic ozone &quot;hole,&quot;concern over the deforestation of the Amazon, and the Exxon oil spill haveall contributed to a general demand for more satellite-based monitoring,which is expected to show up in reinvigorated government spending.andM;British gatherandM;space dataandM;Indeed, the British are building an Earth Observation Data Center to beginprocessing data from the European Space Agency's ERS-1 satellite due forlaunch next year.andP;  NASA, meanwhile, still hopes for funding for its EarthObserving System (EOS), a series of satellites in polar orbit, to begin in1991.andM;The EOS satellites would employ all kinds of new laser-based sensing andsignal processing technology to obtain new types of information on theearth's changing atmospheres, land masses, and oceans.andP;  Subsequent to EOS,NASA hopes to launch Mission to Planet Earth, which would put additionalsatellite in geosynchronous orbit.andM;Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation has adopted what it calls theGlobal Geosciences Initiative -- seven programs that support geoscienceresearch, from solid earth dynamics to global tropospheric chemistry -- thatwill lean on data obtained from both ground-based and satellite-basedmonitoring.andM;Military techandM;could helpandM;Another potential breakthrough for the market would be the release ofmilitary technology -- which is said to put today's 10-meter black and whiteresolution to shame -- for use in commercial systems.andM;Ideally what youhd see then is a combining of satellite and aerial techniques-- as opposed to today's competition -- where the satellite data would beused to pinpiont exactly where higher resolution aerial photographs should betaken.andP;  For the moment there are a number of applications that fall throughthe crack between the pennies per square kilometer for resolution to 30meters and the tens or hundreds of dollars per square kilometer for moredetailed aerial photographs.andM;SpectralandM;side tripandM;&quot;In retrospect,&quot; laments Dr. Welch, &quot;the investment in spectral resolutionmight have been better spent on spatial resolution, particularly given thecapabilities of aerial photography.&quot;andM;For the time being the market must make it through its Horse Latitudes.andP;  At$215 million in special hardware, software, services, and image data sales,it's still too small to be considered robust.andP;  The driving applicationsaren't there yet, nor is the web of software, service, and hardware companysales organizations that would constitute a dynamic market infrastructure.andM;But if the market can continue to sustain 10% growth through the 1990s, itwill exit the decade with both bulk and stability.andP;  Maybe we shouldn't askfor more.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
