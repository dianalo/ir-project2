The $109-a-share offer approved by RJR directors late Wednesdaycapped a day of frantic maneuvering that at times left theunprecedented auction for the nation's 19th largest industrialcompany in utter confusion.   RJR said Kohlberg's offer of $81 in cash, $18 in stock andadditional securities worth $10 beat out a last-minute offer valuedat $112 a share, or $25.2 billion, by chief executive F. RossJohnson's management group.   Although the face value of the management offer looked higher,RJR stated that its board of directors concluded the Kohlberg offerwas worth substantially the same.   ``The Board of Directors of RJR Nabisco, by unanimous vote of alldirectors present, adopted the KKR offer as being in the bestinterest of the company and its shareholders,'' RJR said.   Kohlberg, the undisputed leader in buying companies with borrowedmoney in deals known as leveraged buyouts, said it was pleased withthe decision that ended the biggest takeover brawl in history.   The value of Kohlberg's offer was nearly double that of theprevious record, a $13.4 billion takeover of Gulf Corp. by ChevronCorp. in March 1984.   ``We are also pleased that this process has come to an end sothat the employees of RJR, its consumers and suppliers and thecommunities it serves, can be assured that business will now returnto normal and stability will be restored,'' Kohlberg's twoprincipals, Henry R. Kravis and George Roberts, said in a statement.   Kohlberg's triumph raised the prospect that at least somebusinesses in one of the biggest consumer product companies might besold to help the investment firm pay for the acquisition.   It gave no indication what, if any, of RJR's worldwide operationsmight be for sale. But there was speculation that possiblecandidates included some or even all of RJR's food segments, whichwould return the company to the tobacco business roots that stillaccount for about 40 percent of its sales.   Atlanta-based RJR is one of the largest consumer productscompanies, with more than 120,000 employees worldwide. It makeswell-known brands that range from Camel cigarettes to Shredded Wheatcereal to Life Savers candy.   The size and complexity of the RJR deal has raised majorquestions about the frenzied level of leveraged buyouts and otherdebt-financed restructurings that are transforming much of corporateAmerica and whether it has gone too far.   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. recently agreed to acquire Kraft Inc. for$12.6 billion. Still pending are multibillion-dollar battles overPillsbury Co., Holly Farms Corp., the nation's third-largest poultryprocessor; and textile maker West Point-Pepperell Inc.   The RJR deal also signaled a spectacular defeat by its chiefexecutive F. Ross Johnson, whose management group began the takeoverstruggle Oct. 20 with a $75 a share offer that was later raised fivetimes.   His tenure at the company remained uncertain. However, theAtlanta Constitution reported today that Kohlberg would installRJR's former chairman and chief executive officer, J. Paul Sticht,in the top post for a few months to smooth the transition. Thenewspaper said Kohlberg would move the company's corporateheadquarters back to Winston-Salem, N.C.   It also wasn't clear as of late Wednesday whether Johnson, ascrappy, daring adversary, would try to reopen what already hasproven to be an extremely unpredictable battle. The New York Timesquoted him in today's editions as saying, ``I am proud of the factthat we put the best bid on the table the first time and this time.''   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., one of Johnson's key financialpartners, said in a statemet today, ``From what we know, our bid wasthe best. We are mystified about the process and the standards thatthe board used to reach its decision. We are going to continue tokeep our options open.''   Earlier in the day Wednesday, Johnson's group made an effort toraise its bid after a company-decreed deadline for all offers hadexpired. The move temporarily upended a $106-a-share, $23.8 billionKohlberg Kravis offer that the RJR board was about to approve.   That development made the already unwieldy auction even morechaotic and raised questions about whether all bidders were gettingequal treatment. It also sent RJR's stock $2.25 higher Wednesday infrenzied New York Stock Exchange trading to $93 a share, on thepossibility the auction would be prolonged. In early trading today,RJR was off 75 cents to $92.25 a share.   Sources familiar with the bidding said the offer of a thirdcontender, First Boston Corp. was rejected as too tentative,although the bidder valued it as high as $115 a share or $25.87billion.   A crucial element of each proposal was the portion of cash eang homes,said the report ``is misleading _ it is going to confuse thepublic'' by making it appear conditions are worse than they are. Hesaid that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could leadto a nursing home failing to meet a care standard.   But Elma Holder, executive director of the National Citizens'Coalition on Nursing Home Reform, said: ``We think the nationalstatistics are misleading. Conditions are worse.''</TEXT></DOC>
