The hijackers did not &quot;panic.&quot; After the emergency lights went on, the terrorists herded passengers and made them sit in the middle aisles. According to one passenger who was toward the front, after about 20 minutes of waiting, the two hijackers with machine guns said a prayer in Arabic, then deliberately opened fire, stopped to switch clips and continued firing until they ran out of ammunition. The &quot;experts'&quot; advice to travelers is pathetic. Wearing a suit jacket is not going to offer any protection from an AK-47 machine gun, grenades or explosives, as the toll of 22 dead and more than 100 wounded passengers on this flight will attest.    Based on my experience, the best strategy for a hijacking that occurs on the ground is to activate the emergency slides immediately and evacuate the passengers before the hijackers can gain complete control. As a professional with 28 years of experience in airport planning, design and construction, I can assure you that most airports are woefully unprepared to counter an organized &quot;back door&quot; hijack approach. Weapons can be slipped in easily by cleaning crews, caterers or others with access to the aircraft. Those who say it can't happen in the U.S. are hopeless optimists. The screening procedures here for passengers, carry-on baggage and some checked baggage cuts down on a successful attempt by a lone hijacker. But there is little security-checking for all other people and items boarding an aircraft. Money and manpower will not be spent on this area until an organized attempt occurs in the U.S. forcefully demonstrating the need for even more security.    Darrell R.
