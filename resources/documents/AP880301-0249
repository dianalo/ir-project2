Boone Pickens is prospecting foranother big gold strike, this time making a $1.9 billion cash offerfor Homestake Mining Co., the nation's biggest gold producer.   The offer disclosed Monday came about three months after thenoted raider aborted an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid forNewmont Mining Corp., another major gold producer, and as Pickensis engaged in battles at Texaco Inc. and KN Energy Inc.   The Pickens-controlled Mesa Limited Partnership offered to pay$20 a share for the 93 million outstanding common shares ofHomestake in a negotiated agreement. Mesa already controls about3.8 percent of Homestake's stock.   Homestake said it would consider the unsolicited proposal andreply ``in due course,'' but declined to elaborate.   The company's stock shot up $3.50 to $18 a share Monday on theNew York Stock Exchange, but backtracked to $17.75 in early tradingtoday.   Based in San Francisco, Homestake holds interests in oil andnatural gas and mines uranium, silver and gold, as does Newmont.Founded in 1877, Homestake has an estimated 10 million ounces ofreserves, worth roughly $4.3 billion based on the current goldprice of about $430 an ounce. It reportedly produced 678,000 ounceslast year.   New York-based Newmont last year was the target of IvanhoePartners, a group led by Pickens, which made a $2 billion hostilebid for control of the company.   That move was blocked in October when a Delaware court upheld a``market sweep'' in which Newmont's biggest shareholder, Britain'sConsolidated Gold Fields PLC, snapped up enough shares in a two-daybuying binge to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent of Newmontand thwart the hostile bid.   Pickens made his reputation with high-profile bids for severalmajor oil companies in the early 1980s, including Gulf Corp.,Phillips Petroleum Co. and Unocal Corp.   Mesa launched hostile bids for such companies and then pocketedmillions of dollars in profit when the target company either wasbought out by a higher bidder or repurchased its own stock.   Last year, in addition to the move against Newmont, Pickenstriggered takeover speculation by acquiring significant stakes inSinger Co. and Boeing Co., but no actual offer for either companyever was disclosed. Singer later was taken private by investor PaulBilzerian in a $1.06 billion buyout, in which Mesa participated.   Recently, Pickens announced his intention to seek federalapproval to acquire up to 15 percent of Texaco, and said he wouldsupport actions by fellow takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn to gainseats on the oil giant's board of directors and strip the company'stakeover defenses.   In addition, Pickens earlier this month extended a prolongedcampaign against KN Energy Inc., disclosing he would seek a seat onthe Lakewood, Colo.-based gas pipeline company's board of directors.   Mesa said it owns 400,000 Homestake shares directly and alsoholds a 45 percent interest in a partnership that owns about 3.1million Homestake shares. Mesa has entered into an agreement topurchase the remaining 55 percent of the partnership, which wouldleave Mesa with a 3.8 percent share in Homestake, the company'sstatement said.   In a letter to Homestake chairman Harry Conger, Pickens saidMesa was prepared to proceed promptly with the purchase and wasconfident it could arrange financing for the acquisition.   Pickens also offered to allow key personnel at Homestake toacquire equity stakes in the merged company, ``and thereby bepositioned to benefit directly from the success of their efforts.''   Homestake posted a profit last year of $146.4 million, or $1.51per share, compared with net income of $22.6 million, or 23 cents ashare, in 1986. Revenue rose to $516.2 million from $347.6 million.   The 1987 profit included gains of $95 million on the sale of 20percent of Homestake Gold of Australia Ltd., and $5.7 million fromthe sale of exploration properties in South Dakota and New Zealand.   Homestake is incorporated in Delaware, which recently enacted alaw aimed at hindering hostile corporate takeovers.</TEXT></DOC>
