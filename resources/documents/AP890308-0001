Former Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan, wearing civilian clothes anda disguise of eyeglasses and a goatee, was unarmed when militaryagents took him into custody in Pasay City shortly after midnight,according to Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao.   Dumlao said Cabauatan tried to get away and urged officers toshoot him. But he stopped when one of them placed a gun to his headand threatened to shoot, Dumlao added. He said earlier thatCabauatan offered no resistance.   Cabauatan's brother, Jimmy, and a friend were detained with himoutside the Japanese restaurant but were released, officials said.   Mrs. Aquino praised the military for the capture and toldreporters the arrest ``will lead to greater stability in thiscountry.''   Dumlao said agents surrounded the restaurant and waited outsidefor five hours for Cabauatan to leave after getting a tip he was ata party there.   He said they were not certain it was Cabauatan because of hisdisguise, so agents approached him and saluted. Dumlao said theygrabbed Cabauatan when the former colonel returned the salute.   Dumlao said Cabauatan, a former Philippine Constabulary officer,was taken to Constabulary headquarters at Camp Crame forinterrogation. He said Cabauatan faced three possible criminalcharges, but he did not specify the charges.   Cabauatan was the most prominent anti-Aquino military figureseized since the December 1987 capture of former Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan, leader of an Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt thatleft at least 53 people dead.   Honasan escaped last April from a prison ship in Manila Bay andremains at large.   Cabauatan was sought after a January 1987 coup attempt, whenrenegade soldiers stormed military and news media facilities in thecapital. The government called it an attempt to restore oustedPresident Ferdinand Marcos to power.   Cabauatan also took part in an abortive putsch at The ManilaHotel in July 1986 and was believed to have been linked to an attackon the stockade at Manila's Fort Bonifacio in April 1987.   Cabauatan went underground and was later dropped from militaryrolls as absent without leave. In statements to reporters, heclaimed to have organized the Nationalist Army of the Philippines tocontinue his struggle against Mrs. Aquino.   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the PhilippineConstabulary, told reporters Thursday there were ``very strongindications that the money being used by this group came fromex-President Marcos.'' He did not elaborate.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos identified Cabauatan as one of themajor military figures sought in armed attempts against thepresident.   Oliver Lozano, a right-wing lawyer, said he spoke by telephonewith Cabauatan minutes after his arrest and said Cabauatan ``willcooperate so the truth will come out.''   Lozano said Cabauatan opposed violent attempts to overthrow thegovernment but sought change ``through peaceful, democratic andlegal means.''   He said Cabauatan supported a campaign by former Lt. Col. RolandoAbadilla to forge ``genuine reconciliation'' between Mrs. Aquino andMarcos. Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return from exilein Hawaii, where he fled after a popular uprising toppled hisadministration three years ago.   Abadilla, former intelligence chief of the Manila area, was alsocharged in the January 1987 coup attempt but was acquitted by amilitary court in December.   In another development, a relative of Mrs. Aquino chargedWednesday that an American consulting firm was hired by VicePresident Salvador Laurel to undermine the government.   But a spokesman for the company, Black, Manafort, Stone and Kellyof Alexandria, Va., said it was simply helping the oppositionorganize a political party before the 1992 presidential election.   During a speech to the House of Representatives, Rep. EmigdioTanjuatco, said the company ``monitored activity in Congress and inthe executive branch relevant to the Philippines'' as part of aneffort by Laurel to discredit the government.   Laurel broke with Mrs. Aquino last year and announced he wasorganizing an opposition movement.</TEXT></DOC>
