The Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Anbaa said the interview conducted inBelgrade, Yugoslavia, was the first with Khaled Abdel Nasser sincecriminal charges were filed against him in Cairo. It quoted him assaying he would return to Egypt for trial even though he facedpossible execution.   Khaled Nasser is among 20 men charged in connection with fourshooting attacks on U.S. and Israeli diplomats and embassy workersbetween 1984 and 1987. Two Israelis were killed and six Israelisand two Americans were wounded.   He and the other defendants are accused of membership in aclandestine group called Egypt's Revolution. The indictment demandsthe death penalty for Nasser, 38, and 10 other defendants, andprison terms of up to life for the others.   Egypt has said it is trying to extradite Khaled Nasser for trialas one of three founders of Egypt's Revolution and its mainfinancial backer. The group is committed to ending the Israelipresence in Egypt and Egyptian commitment to the 1979 peace treatywith the Jewish state.   Al-Anbaa said Algeria had offered political refugee status toNasser but he refused, saying: ``My father never imagined beingsuch in any country and preferred to die while fighting his enemiesrather than accept that. Therefore I am determined to return toCairo because death in Cairo is much better than living elsewhere.''   Gamal Abdel Nasser led a bloodless military coup that oustedKing Farouk in 1952, and ruled as a fierce nationalist until hisdeath in 1970.   While he was in office, Egypt faced the 1956 invasion byBritain, France and Israel and Israel captured the Sinai Peninsulaand Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war.   Nasser's successor, the late Anwar Sadat, led the countrythrough the 1973 war with Israel and signed the peace treaty withIsrael in 1979.   In referring to ``a defamation campaign'' in the Egyptian pressagainst him and his two younger brothers, according to Al-Anbaa,Nasser said it was ``not separate from the hostile American andIsraeli blueprint which has been employed over the past 36 yearswith the aim of obliterating Nasser's legendary place in the heartsof the Arab masses.''   ``The defamation campaign being launched against me and mybrothers is but an American and Israeli attempt to settle oldaccounts,'' he said.   ``Those who failed to face President Nasser for 18 years of hisrule and to eradicate his name from the conscience of the Egyptianmasses for 18 years after his death now return to launch theircampaigns.''</TEXT></DOC>
