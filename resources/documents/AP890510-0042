Some medical and legal professionals also disagree withWinnebago County State's Attorney Paul Logli's decision Monday tocharge Melanie Green, who became the second Rockford woman in aweek to be taken to court for exposing an unborn child to cocaine.   ``It could very well drive these cocaine-abusing mothersunderground,'' said spokesman Dave Schneidman of the stateDepartment of Children and Family Services.   ``You want to develop an atmosphere where they know (they) cancome into the health-care system and not be penalized. A punitiveapproach is not going to benefit the children,'' said Dr. Ira J.Chasnoff at Northwestern University Medical School, who hasdirected studies on the effects of prenatal cocaine use.   Early treatment for drug abuse works better, he said.   ``The concern is that low-income women, who don't have access toeducational and medical programs that middle-class women do ...might avoid the system altogether,'' said attorney Colleen Connellwith the American Civil Liberties Union in Chicago.   The prosecutor defended his decision as a desire to protectchildren.   ``The actions of this office reflect the concern, sometimes theoutrage, of this community that children are born ... at risk, bothat birth and for many years,'' Logli said in a telephone interviewfrom Rockford, 85 miles northwest of Chicago.   ``The aim is to protect children.''   Ms. Green's baby, Bianca, died Feb. 4. An autopsy said theinfant died of oxygen deprivation linked to cocaine exposure latein the pregnancy.   Ms. Green, 24, also was charged with delivery of a controlledsubstance to a minor, Logli said.   Involuntary manslaughter is a felony punishable by two to fiveyears in prison. The prosecutor said Ms. Green could face a 14-yearmaximum penalty if she is convicted of the drug charge. She wasreleased on $3,500 bond. Arraignment is scheduled May 31, Loglisaid.   Schneidman said 90 percent of Illinois' cocaine babies are inCook County _ 1,095 of the 1,233 cases reported in 1988.   Infants exposed to cocaine tripled to 27 in Rockford during thepast year, compared to the previous year, Logli said.   Prenatal exposure can cause numerous health problems includinglow birth weight, impaired motor ability, irritability that canhinder learning, strokes and seizures.   When a child dies after events that occurred ``while the childwas still in the womb, the law provides protection for that childand allows for prosecution of the person who causes those events,''he said.   ``My job as a prosecutor is simply to charge those events whereviolation of the law works toward the harm of others,'' Logli said.   Logli said he was unaware of any similiar deaths in Illinois orelsewhere.   On May 1, a judge in Rockford convicted a juvenile mother ofchild abuse and neglect for cocaine exposure during pregnancy. Thechild, who shows no ill effects at 3 months, was temporarilyremoved from her custody.   A Florida woman was charged with child abuse and delivery of adrug in December after her child was born addicted to cocaine.Prosecutors said it was the first such case in that state.   In 1987, a California judge dismissed a charge of failure toprovide medical care to a child, lodged against a woman whose sonwas born brain damaged and later died. Prosecutors accused her ofignoring a doctor's advice not to abuse drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
