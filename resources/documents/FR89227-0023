These expedited payments are madeto meet financial emergencies before eligibility can be determined in casesin which eligibility is expected to be found. Before December 22, 1987,the maximum amount that could be advanced was $100 (or $200 for a couple).Effective December 22, 1987, the maximum EAP amount was raised to an amountequal to the Federal benefit rate plus any State supplemetary payment thatwould be payable to an eligible individual who has no other countable income.As before the amendment, because it is an advance against future benefits,an EAP is later deducted from the benefits due if the individual is determinedto be eligible. We are also proposing revisions to andSection; 416.520 whichexplain how the EAP is computed and, if applicable, recovered.We have also proposed changes to andSection; 416.502 to omit references tochecks in the discussion on the manner of SSI payment, in order to accommodatedirect deposits to financial institutions and to provide that paymentsmay be made before the first day of a month under certain circumstances.We are also proposing a revision in andSection; 416.1403 to change the term``emergencty cash advance'' to ``emergency advance payment.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Executive Order No. 12291The Secretary has determined that this is not a major rule under the termsof Executive Order 12291 because no additional program or administrativecosts are contemplated and the threshold criteria for a major rule arenot otherwise met. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980These proposed regulations impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirementssubject to Office of Management and Budget clearance.Regulatory Flexibility ActWe certify that these proposed regulations, if promulgated, will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesbecause they affect only individuals and States. Therefore, a regulatoryflexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96-354, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, is not required.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 13.807, SupplementalSecurity Program)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 416</ITAG>Administration practice and procedure, Aged, Blind, Disability benefits,Public assistance programs, Supplemental security income.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 13, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Dorcas R.

Section 416.520 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 416.520</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Emergency advance payments.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Before we make a determination on an application, wemay pay a one-time emergency advance payment to an individual who is presumptivelyeligible for SSI benefits and who has a financial emergency. The amountof this payment cannot exceed the Federal benefit rate (see andSection;andSection;416.410 through 416.414) plus the State supplementary payment, if any (seeandSection; 416.2020), which apply for the month in which payment is made.``Emergency advance payment'' is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.The actual payment amount is computed as explained in paragraph (c) ofthis section. An emergency advance payment is an advance of benefits expectedto be due, that is recoverable as explained in paragraphs (d) and (e) ofthis section. (b) <T3>Definition of terms.</T3> For purposes of this subpart_(1) <T3>``Emergency advance payment''</T3> means a direct, expedited paymentby a Social Security Administration district or branch office to an individualor spouse who is initially applying (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section)and has not been determined eligible, who is presumptively eligible (seeparagraph (b)(4) of this section), and who has a financial emergency (seeparagraph (b)(2) of this section).(2) <T3>``Financial emergency''</T3> is the financial status of an individualwho has insufficient income or resources to meet an immediate threat tohealth or safety, such as the lack of food, clothing, shelter, or medicalcare.(3) <T3>``Initially applying'' </T3>means the filing of an application (seeandSection; 416.310) which requires an initial determination of eligibility,such as the first application for SSI benefits or an application filedsubsequent to a prior denial or termination of a prior period of eligibilityfor payment. An individual or spouse who previously received an emergencyadvance payment in a prior period of eligibility which terminated may againreceive such a payment if he or she reapplies for SSI and meets the otherconditions for an emergency advance payment under this section.(4) ``<T3>Presumptively eligible</T3>'' is the status of an individual or spousewho presents strong evidence of the likelihood of meeting the income andresources tests of eligibility (see Subparts K and L of this part), categoricaleligibility (age, disability, or blindness), and technical eligibility(United States residency and citizenship or alien status-see Subpart P).(c) <T3>Computation of payment amount. </T3>To compute the emergency advancepayment amount, the maximum amount described in paragraph (a) of this sectionis compared to both the expected benefit payable for the month the paymentis made (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section) and the amount the applicantrequested to meet the emergency. The actual payment amount is no more thanthe least of these three amounts.(1) In computing the emergency advance payment amount, we apply the monthlyincome counting and proration rules appropriate for the month in whichthe advance is paid, as explained in andSection;andSection; 416.420 and 416.421.(2) For a couple, we separately compute each member's emergency advancepayment amount.(d) <T3>Recovery of emergency advance payment where eligibility is established.</T3>The amount of an emergency advance payment is deducted from payment(s)certified to the United States Treasury when the individual or spouse isdetermined to be eligible. (See paragraph (e) of this section if the individualor spouse is determined to be ineligible.)(e) <T3>Disposition of emergency advance payments where eligibility is notestablished. </T3>If a presumptively eligible individual (or spouse) orcouple is determined to be ineligible, the emergency advance payment constitutesa recoverable overpayment. (See the exception in andSection; 416.537(b)(1)when payment is made on the basis of presumptive disability or presumptiveblindness.)<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart N_[Amended]</ITAG>4.
