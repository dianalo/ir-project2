Gorbachev's announcementof a military force cutback in Europe and Asia, a White Housespokesman said today.   ``The president's view of this was that it was a unilateraldecision on the part of the Soviet Union,'' said spokesman MarlinFitzwater. ``We certainly point out the unilateral nature of it as away of saying there is no response required.''   Fitzwater's remarks came amid assertions by other governmentofficials and private analysts that Gorbachev's vow to cut the sizeof the Soviet Army could put new pressure on the United States towithdraw troops from Europe. But these same officials and analystssaid such a move would do nothing to reduce the U.S. federal deficit.   At his daily White House news briefing, Reagan's spokesman wasasked whether it was fair to say that there would be no U.S.response to Gorbachev's announcement last week of a 500,000-troopreduction in Soviet ground forces along with cuts in militaryarmaments.   ``It would be appropriate to say it was a unilateral decisionthat did not require a unilateral reciprocal action and that noreciprocal action is expected,'' Fitzwater replied.   Several officials interviewed about the impact of Gorbachev'sinitiative said that unless President-elect Bush is prepared toreduce the overall size of the American military, simply bringinghome U.S. soldiers to match a Soviet withdrawal of troops fromEuropean front lines wouldn't save money and might even cost more.   ``It's debatable whether you get any cost savings, and if you dothey're minimal,'' says Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the seniorRepublican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``We don't evenhave the facilities here to accommodate them.''   If Bush decides not only to withdraw troops from Europe but alsoto dismiss them from the military, the budget savings could besubstantial. Pentagon officials and top brass, however, will resistsuch a move.   The service was forced to cut its strength by 8,600 soldiers inbudget cuts last year and is now fielding its smallest active-dutyforce since before the Korean War in 1950 _ about 772,000.   ``Further reductions would increase the risk to the nation'ssecurity,'' a new Army briefing paper warns.   Outgoing Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, in several recentspeeches, has made it clear he will not include any further ``forcestructure'' cuts in the Reagan administration's final budgetproposal, which goes to Congress in January.   He has publicly urged Bush to endorse that budget proposal andfight Congress for a 2 percent real increase in Pentagon spending.   Carlucci further has sought to remind the American public thereare important concerns besides money that guide the stationing oftroops overseas. To be simplistic, he says it is far better for U.S.forces to engage the enemy on foreign soil than on Americanterritory.   ``It is a strategy that requires a U.S. military presence beyondour shores _ not from habit, not as a gift _ but rather for thedefense of U.S. interests and U.S. prosperity,'' he said in a speechlast May.   ``Bringing U.S. troops home from abroad would not save moneyunless we deactivate them.''   ``There are some expenses you incur by posting troops overseasthat you don't face here, including swings in the valuation of thedollar, higher travel costs, etc.,'' said one top Pentagon financialofficer who asked not to be identified.   ``But that's small potatoes compared to the fact that we don'thave the housing or facilities at our bases to accommodate theseguys. The refurbishing and construction would be a huge expense.''   The United States has about 318,000 servicemen assigned toWestern Europe, of whom about 212,000 are Army troops. Another200,000 are deployed to other countries around the world or at seaon Navy ships, meaning roughly 25 percent of the Americanactive-duty force of 2.1 million is deployed outside the UnitedStates.   Gorbachev told a United Nations audience last week that theSoviet Union will unilaterally reduce its own military of more than5.1 million by 500,000 troops and pull back 50,000 assigned to thefront lines facing NATO.   Retired Rear Adm. Gene R. LaRocque, the director of the Centerfor Defense Information and a frequent critic of Reaganadministration policies, argues that the United States could easilyremove 50,000 troops from Europe without jeopardizing NATO security.   ``I'm concerned that if we don't respond in some way, theSoviets' initiative will be of no avail to reducing forces in thelong run,'' he says.   ``There's nothing magic about the number of troops we have therenow. Pulling troops back to the U.S. doesn't do anything for yourbudget this year, but if conditions improve then we can graduallyshrink our forces.''   Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,counters that the cuts announced by Gorbachev would still leave theWarsaw Pact with a strong numerical advantage in conventionalforces. Alliance leaders should be ``first, watchful, and second,wary'' of Gorbachev's moves, Crowe said last week.   Barry Blechman, a former government arms control executive andnow a defense consultant, maintains that the United States couldsave $15 billion if half of its troops and 10 bomber squadrons weredeactivated.   The United States should use the Gorbachev initiative as astarting point for negotiating mutual, 50 percent troop reductions,he says, adding: ``This military competition is out of sync withtoday's politics and economics.''</TEXT></DOC>
