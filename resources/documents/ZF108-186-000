that Defense Department users still donot have an easy way to order inexpensive PC software and peripherals.andM;The Navy and Zenith Data Systems Corp. have filed for reconsideration of theGeneral Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals decisionoverturning the Navy's selection of Zenith as the Companion contractor.andM;Capt.andP;  Katherine Laughton, commanding officer of the Navy Automatic DataProcessing Selection Office (ADPSO), said in an interview, &quot;My frustration,personally, is that when all is said and done we didn't deliver.andP;  The longerit takes us to get a contract out on the street the less value it has to thepoor user.andP;  This extra delay will cost us.&quot;andM;&quot;I personally think it was a very good award,&quot; added Laughton, who headed theSource Selection Advisory Council.andM;What went wrong?andP;  &quot;I wish I knew,&quot; she said.andM;The requirements contract, worth as much as $800 million, was intended tomake upgrades, software, peripherals and support available to the 400,000 DODusers of Zenith Z-248 computers.andP;  An unsuccessful bidder, GovernmentTechnology Services Inc. of Chantilly, Va., protested the award to Zenith onseveral grounds.andM;The GSBCA agreed with GTSI's argument that the commercially availableversions of the LBP-8 MK III laser printer from Canon USA Inc. of LakeSuccess, N.Y., and the DataEase database management system from DataEaseInternational Inc. of Trumbull, Conn., that Zenith showed at its live testdemonstration (LTD) could not meet request for proposal specifications.andM;Laughton said she was present to hear the decision.andM;&quot;I feel very discouraged because I don't feel that anybody has beenwell-served by this action.andP;  Our job is to take care of the person who hasthat requirement, and we weren't able to do that,&quot; she said.andM;A Zenith spokesman said his company was not out of the running yet.andM;&quot;Our contract hasn't been terminated, only suspended.andP;  We're prepared toperform on the contract if the motion [for reconsideration] is granted.andO;Either way, many of these products will be carried by Zenith,&quot; he said.andM;Zenith is considering several avenues in its fight to keep Companion, hesaid.andM;&quot;We're waiting for our motion to be considered.andP;  It doesn't preclude anappeal to the courts,&quot; he said.andM;Zenith's printer problems hinged on its PostScript graphics languagecompatibility.andM;The company's machine required two read-only-memory cards or cartridges toprint PostScript files; the version Zenith promised to deliver via Companionneeded only one.andM;&quot;The printer Zenith proposed was not available to the general public, asrequired by the solicitation.andP;  The record at most demonstrates that theprinter would be available to Zenith under an exclusive arrangement withoutgiving anyone outside of this contract the opportunity to procure it foruse,&quot; GSBCA Judge Joseph Vergilio said in his written opinion.andM;The Zenith spokesman said the problem stemmed from a misunderstanding.andM;&quot;The latest Phoenix PostScript firmware does indeed require only onecartridge.andP;  At the time of the LTD, two cards were required.andP;  However, theyhave always been available from both Canon and Zenith,&quot; he said.andM;Vergilio also noted that the commercial version of DataEase did not useStructured Query Language as required by the contract RFP.andP;  GTSI charged thatZenith had to decompile the existing product, add SQL capabilities to itssource code, then recompile.andM;&quot;Integration of the SQL feature into DataEase rendered this software asignificantly different product from prior versions of DataEase,&quot; the judgewrote, adding that &quot;more than a simple enhancement to an existing product&quot;was involved.andM;Chris Behling, senior production manager at DataEase, disputed the finding.andM;&quot;DataEase 4S, our single-user version, has SQL and has been commerciallyavailable since the contract was negotiated,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;I don't know if anybody has bought it, but it is commercially available.&quot;andM;There was no indication of when the board might rule on the request forreconsideration.andP;  The GSBCA is not bound to rule on such requests by aspecific deadline, although it has deadlines for ruling on protests.andM;The GSBCA opinion directed the Navy to make a new award but did not spell outhow to do so.andM;Laughton said the possibility that other offerors' best-and-final offers willhave similar technical problems may be a major stumbling block.andM;&quot;We're analyzing potential problems as they occur.andP;  I'm not going to commenton whether we've found any so far.andP;  The standard which was given to us [bythe GSBCA] is a very stringent one.andP;  We did not get any direction from theboard as to how to proceed from here,&quot; she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
