Jr.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>TWISTED-PAIR WIRINGandM;A consultant provided our 50-person law firm with a design for a LAN in a newbuilding.andP;  The PC users were shocked that he recommended using a star-typelayout with unshielded twisted-pair wiring.andP;  I was under the impression thatsystems using unshielded twisted-pair do so as a sort of kludge to make useof existing telephone wiring.andP;  Given the choice, when you're starting fresh,doesn't it make more sense to use the best available coax or fiber-opticcabling? Can you point us in the right direction?andM;Ted JohnsonandM;(via CompuServe)andM;A lot of folks have misconceptions about using unshielded twisted-pair wiringfor Ethernet, ARCnet, or Token-Ring service.andP;  The first big error is thinkingthat you can use existing telephone wire.andP;  Chances are that you don't haveenough wire pairs, the wires run through areas of high electrical noise,other services like intercoms won't let you use pairs in the same cable, orit's the wrong kind of wire.andP;  You're better off assuming that you'll have topull new wire and then being pleasantly surprised if you find that you canuse even a little of the existing stuff.andM;The best thing about unshielded twisted-pair wire isn't that it's cheap--thecost of labor overshadows the cost of wire--but that it's familiar andaesthetically acceptable.andM;Twisted-pair wiring for Ethernet conforms to an evolving IEEE standard called10BaseT.andP;  This standard describes twisted-pair wiring with a10-megabit-per-second data rate and baseband signaling.andP;  The benches at PCLAN Labs are groaning under the weight of 10BaseT wiring hubs, cables, andLAN adapters because we're in the middle of an evaluation of these products.andO;On the whole, this is an excellent wiring alternative.andP;  It's resistant tooutages and easy to install.andM;The twisted-pair wiring standard for ARCnet was set by Standard Microsystems.andO;From everything I hear, these installations work well.andP;  Both the ARCnet andEthernet twisted-pair systems provide sound reliability.andM;Here's a joke currently making the rounds at trade shows.andP;  &quot;What do you calla LAN administrator who uses unshielded twisted-pair wiring for Token-Ring?&quot;andO;The answer: unemployed.andP;  Unlike Ethernet and ARCnet, Token-Ring networks thetotally if any of the four wires carrying data to any single station on thenetwork develops a bad connection.andP;  A bad twisted-pair connection on ARCnetor Ethernet can lead to a station outage.andP;  If that station is a server or agateway, of course, the problem is serious, but most outages are merelyinconvenient.andP;  Every outage on an unshielded Token-Ring network is adisaster.andP;  I have seen some successful unshielded Token-Ring installations,but I've also heard some very sad stories.andM;I doubt that your law firm needs the extended distance features or resistanceto electrical noise you'd gain from fiber optics, and I also doubt that youcould justify the cost.andP;  If your consultant recommended twisted-pair wiringfor Ethernet or ARCnet, I'd support it.andP;  If he recommended unshieldedtwisted-pair for Token-Ring, I'd find a new consultant.andM;MAKING MOBILE CONNECTIONSandM;We have people roaming the city in repair trucks all day.andP;  Right now they usecellular phones to call into the office for their instructions and thenscribble the information on paper.andP;  Often they need to call back for arepeat.andP;  They use PCs in their trucks for troubleshooting.andP;  How can weconnect the mobile PCs through cellular telephones to our internal databasein order to eliminate voice calls and paper scribbling?andM;Hiram RobertsandM;Milwaukee, WisconsinandM;Data transmission over cellular phone links presents many difficulties.andP;  Notonly is line quality lower and more variable than even the worst land lines,but the modem must also contend with cell handoffs, which can cause it tolose the carrier for as long as I or 2 seconds.andM;I know of three companies--Microcom, Spectrum Cellular, and Telebit--thatmarket products with cellular modem capabilities.andM;Microcom and Spectrum Cellular use special error-correcting protocols tosurvive the cellular interruptions.andP;  Microcom uses MNP-10, a superset of itswell-known MNP protocol suite, to provide reliable high-speed throughput.andO;With the Microcom solution, you'll need an NNP-capable modem (MNP-10 is best)at the fixed site location unless you have very quiet cellular communicationslocations.andP;  Microcom has some new cellular products that provide excellentcapabilities.andP;  Call (800) 822-8224 to learn about them.andM;Spectrum Cellular modems use a proprietary error-correction system, SPCL,developed by Spectrum and licensed by a number of cellular modemmanufacturers including ITC, Novatel, and Omnitel.andP;  Spectrum Cellular'sLapPak combines a Toshiba T1200 laptop with a cellular phone and modem andcosts from 4,950 to $7,025, depending on configuration.andP;  The company also hasa full line of cellular modems starting at $595.andM;A spectacular advantage of the Spectrum Cellular approach is that it hasmodems integrated into approximately 120 cellular systems around NorthAmerica.andP;  This means you don't need a special modem at the fixed phonelocation.andP;  Call Spectrum Cellular at (214) 630-9825 for more information.andM;Telebit's cellular modem, the CellBlazer, has a blazing effective throughputrate of 16,800 bits per second.andP;  Telebit fights cellular interruptions withtwo technologies: modulation optimization and advanced proprietary errorcorrection.andM;First, unlike standard modems, which use only one audio frequency for sendingand one for receiving, the CellBlazer uses up to 511 different frequenciessimultaneously across the entire usable cellular audio band of 30 to 3,000MHz.andP;  Since it relies on only a few signal shifts per frequency, it's lesssensitive to the quality of a single frequency.andP;  When it makes a connection,the modem automatically runs a &quot;spectral analysis&quot; to determine whichfrequencies are best; it can encode 2, 4, or 6 bits on good frequencies whiletransmitting only 2 bits or even skipping bad frequencies.andM;For error correction, the $1,295 CellBlazer uses a proprietary CRC-16 basederror-correction protocol (PEP, or packetized ensemble protocol) that doesnot involve the overhead of forward error correction.andP;  This supports themultichannel transmission method that the CellBlazer uses, varying the packetsizes per channel according to channel quality.andP;  If too many errors occur, itcan shift to better channels or, as a last resort, it can kick back intotraining mode and reanalyze the quality of the line.andP;  Further, it can stepdown in increments of 100 bps, instead of halving its speed, as standardmodems must.andP;  Note, however, that you need CellBlazers at both ends to makethis link work.andM;CellBlazer supports Lempel-Zev compression, and this can be supplemented bysoftware compression algorithms for throughputs of up to 30,000 bps.andP;  Forcommunication over land lines, it supports V.22bis (2,400 baud) now.andP;  V.42and V.42bis are in the works, V. 32 is not.andM;Handoffs are detected automatically and handled through the standarderror-correction routine; the modem knows not to hang up, remaining on theline and buffering data until the handoff is completed and communication isrestored.andP;  The sensitivity can be adjusted according to conditions.andO;Communication with the host is always at 19,200 bps.andM;The company initially envisions highly specialized applications in fieldoperations (insurance claims, field service, and so on) that may requiretransmission of large amounts of bit-image data.andP;  They demonstratedtransmission of a digital image to us; it seemed to work well, though thepoor cellular connections they were able to make limited the modem's speed toabout 6,000 or 7,000 bps.andP;  The modem got knocked off-line the first time ittried to make a connection, but it had the grace to do it in the initialconnection phase, not in the middle of the job.andP;  The second try wentsmoothly.andM;The internal modem is a full-slot card, so your portable must be able to takestandard IBM cards in order to really use it.andP;  You also need a data interfacefor your cellular transceiver, a klunky box with wires hanging out of it.andM;The cost, though high, is not exorbitant in relation to, say, 9,600 bps V.32modems, and depending on how you pay for your cellular time, the CellBlazermay be a better deal than low-speed competitors.andP;  Contact Telebit at (415)969-3800.andM;KEEPING UP TO DATEandM;I'm in charge of technical publications for a major network productdeveloper.andP;  The variety of available newsletters is confusing.andP;  Whichpublications do you think our library should acquire?andM;Jane SlipoandM;Cleveland, OhioandM;The first thing you need to acquire is a subscription to Ziff-Davis'sComputer Library on CD-ROM.andP;  Computer Library is a database of 140journals--30 in full text--and 11 top computer industry newsletters.andP;  Asubscription for a single CPU costs $765 per year plus a charge of $25 forshipping.andP;  If you want to make Computer Library available on a network, theLAN license costs an additional $995 per year per concurrent access.andP;  Thisreally isn't very expensive, when you consider that people don't usuallyenter the information base concurrently.andP;  The basic subscription and one LANlicense would probably support a 50-user network.andP;  Call (212) 503-4400 formore information.andM;Computer Library is a great general resource, but unfortunately it doesn'tcontain the best LAN newsletter.andP;  Serious developers and manufacturers trackthe technology through the LOCALNetter Newsletter, marketed by ArchitectureTechnology Corporation.andP;  This newsletter is only $300 a year forsubscriptions inside the U. S. It's always the first thing I fish out fromthe mass of my in-box.andP;  Call Architecture Technology at (612) 935-2035 torequest a sample copy.andM;Finally, the LAN Labs just started work on a book with the working title  ThePC Magazine Guide to Connectivity,&quot; to be published by Ziff-Davis Press.andP;  Isuggest you save some of your budget for a few hundred copies.andM;CONNECTING TO AUTOMOTIVE COMPUTERS: PART IIandM;In the May 15, 1990, issue of PC Magazine, we described the Diacom Diagnosticpackage designed to connect your PC to the computer diagnostics port ofGeneral Motors vehicles.andP;  We recently received a letter from RindaTechnologies informing us that they developed, manufacture, and market theproduct.andP;  The company we credited, Mextel, is a nonexclusive dealer.andM;Rinda just released a new $299 software package that lets Diacom read datafrom 1984 through 1989 Chrysler vehicles.andP;  If you want your PC to know aboutyour car's RPM, Hg, DEG, and VDC, contact Rinda Technologies at (312)7366633.andM;NETWORK YOUR QUESTIONSandM;Connectivity gives you practical solutions to networking problems of alltypes.andP;  We'll pay $50 for any tips we print.andP;  Please submit your letter on adisk along with a printout.andP;  Then mad your contributions to Connectivity, PCMagazine, One Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016, or you may contact Frank J.andO;Derfler, Jr., via MCI Mail  be sure to use Derfler's box named PC MAGAZINELAN LABS).andP;  We are unable to answer letters individually.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
