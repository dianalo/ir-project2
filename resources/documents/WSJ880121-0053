Concerned about increasing overhead and large pre-crash and post-crash trading losses, First Boston has begun the layoffs, which one senior official said will &quot;easily&quot; total 10% of the staff, or at least 550 people.    The big securities firm is expected to announce today a management shake-up in the firm's trading and sales operations, primarily to address the erratic performance of bond trading activities, firm officials said. First Boston is also expected to announce a merger of its corporate finance and investment banking operations, a move that would likely increase the power of the firm's mergers and acquisitions star, Bruce Wasserstein, the officials said.    Peter T. Buchanan, First Boston's chief executive officer, said in an interview that the firm intends to announce &quot;the results of our planning process&quot; today, but he declined to discuss specific moves. He said that there will be &quot;no across-the-board layoffs,&quot; and that no operations would be discontinued. But he did say that certain areas of the firm have been targeted for action in order to &quot;increase efficiency.&quot;    Last year's slumping bond market and the stock market's October crash have led many firms on Wall Street to conduct sweeping reviews of their business and staffing.    The strategic review at First Boston has been the focus of attention inside and outside the firm because it has taken longer than reviews at other firms, and because there has been considerable tension among First Boston senior officials.    Last year, Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Wasserstein, the firm's biggest moneymaker, squared off over the future of the firm's bond trading operations. Mr. Wasserstein felt the trading operation should be refocused to stop the losses and to support the firm's merchant banking activity, an offshoot of Mandamp;A in which First Boston uses its own capital to help clients acquire companies. Mr. Buchanan, a former trader himself, rejected any reduction in bond trading and sales, arguing that the firm needed to be a major player in that area.    While defending the trading operations, Mr. Buchanan has made no secret of his unhappiness over its performance. The unit had big losses in both 1986 and 1987. Some firm officials complain that the fixed income trading division lacks the discipline of the equity division.    Last June, First Boston had a loss of about $100 million trading a single, risky product-options on Treasury bonds. In the summer of 1986, it had a loss of more than $100 million trading a mortgage bond known as a &quot;Z Tranche.&quot;    The firm's equity arbitrage department, which speculates on takeover stocks, had considerable losses during the crash, pushing the firm into the red for October.    For the past few years, First Boston has been caught up in power struggles between its highly successful Mandamp;A group and its corporate finance staff, which helps companies with stock and bond offerings. As the Mandamp;A group has succeeded in bringing in what would normally be corporate finance business, its power has grown.    In 1986, the firm's top Mandamp;A bankers, Mr. Wasserstein and Joseph R. Perella, were named co-heads of investment banking, a department which incorporated Mandamp;A and certain aspects of investment banking. The corporate finance staff remained a separate department, which is unusual on Wall Street.    One cost-cutting move the firm implemented earlier this month affects the way bond salesmen are paid. The salesmen had been paid on a straight commission basis, which gave the firm no ability to cut compensation when the performance of the rest of the firm couldn't support a big payout. Under the new system, bond salesmen will be eligible for a guaranteed minimum commission, but the remainder of their compensation will be decided by senior managers. A similar change was made for equity salesmen about a year ago.    Reflecting its bond market troubles last year, First Boston's earnings for the first nine months of 1987 were down 13% to $103.8 million, or $2.95 a share, from $118.9 million, or $3.33 a share.    ---   James B.
