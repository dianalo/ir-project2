Roh, in a nationally televised speech, said the government isdetermined to end a wave of protests that has hit South Korea inrecent weeks. He did not specify any action, but under theconstitution he may rule by decree or impose martial law if hedeems the nation is facing an emergency.   ``If violence and illegal acts endanger democracy and the futureof the country, I would be obliged to invoke emergency measures asempowered by the constitution,'' Roh said.   The officers were killed during a dawn raid at Dongui Universityin Pusan, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul, as they tried tobreak into a room on the seventh floor of the library to free fiveofficers held hostage.   Militants set fire to a barricade drenched with paint thinner asthe policemen were climbing over it, police said. Several officers,wrapped in flames, leapt out of windows while others were burned orasphyxiated, said police officials who declined to be identified.   National police headquarters in Seoul said it was the worst lossof police life in recent years. Police said some of the 10policemen critically injured were expected to die. One student wascritically hurt.   All the hostages were released unharmed after professors at theprivate college pleaded with students, police said. They said 88students were arrested for questioning.   National Police Chief Jo Jong-suk resigned. In South Korea,senior officials often resign to atone for a disaster even if it isnot their fault.   Also today, news reports said the U.S. Cultural Center in theprovincial city of Kwangju would be temporarily closed and moved toan as yet undetermined location. The center is a frequent target ofradical students demanding the ouster of U.S. troops stationed inSouth Korea.   Officials at the U.S. Embassy denied the report by the Yonhapnews agency.   Roh charged in his speech that radical students are trying tostage a violent revolution and declared the government isdetermined to crush them.   ``It has become clear that behind the flames that took the livesof young people, there are revolutionary groups which resort toviolence to achieve their goals,'' he said.   Opposition parties also denounced the deaths today and calledfor an end to political violence.   Hundreds of radical students calling for Roh's overthrow battledriot police around at least two Seoul campuses. Protesters cheeredat Sungkyunkwan University when several policemen were set ablazeby firebombs, but colleagues quickly doused the flames and theofficers were not hurt.   Protests here rarely result in deaths. Riot police normally arearmed only with tear gas and batons.   Prosecutors said students implicated in today's deaths wouldface charges of arson, which carry a maximum penalty of death.Officials said no one had been charged.   Stunned riot officers wept as the dead and injured were takenaway. About 150 police officers staged a sit-down protest at Pusanpolice headquarters to complain that senior officers mishandled theattack, Yonhap reported.   Police officials said about 700 riot police raided the privatecollege after negotiations failed to free the hostages.   Students seized the officers Tuesday after demonstrating againstthe firing of warning shots by police at attackers who menaced apolice station Monday, police said. The students demanded policeexchange the hostages for an arrested student.   The Education Ministry ordered the university closedindefinitely while police investigate the incident.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recentweeks by radical students and dissidents demanding the overthrow ofRoh's government.   The radicals lack public support because of their extremism andviolent tactics, but they have formed alliances with strikingworkers to step up the protests.   In a related report, police said today about 3,800 police havebeen injured this year by firebombs, rocks, clubs and iron barswhile blocking violent protesters.   Police said 9,950 police were injured in 1986 and 6,701 in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
