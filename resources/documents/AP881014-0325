(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Biogen Inc. finally turned the corner inthe unsteady genetic research industry Friday, reporting its firstquarterly profit after racking up more than $100 million in lossessince its founding 10 years ago.   It was the first time that Biogen, one of the nations' earliestbiotechnology start-ups, has been in the black since going publicin 1983.   Analysts said a major restructuring that emphasized themarketing of new drug and disease-testing procedures has helpedBiogen transform a $6.99 million loss in the 1987 third quarterinto a modest profit of $361,000, or 2 cents a share, in thisyear's quarter.   ``This is the first turnaround story in the biotechnologysector,'' said Viren Mehta, a vice president at S.G. Warburg Co. inNew York.   The good news comes at a time when biotech stocks have beenslumping. Shares of industry leader Genentech Inc. of San Franciscowere trading at $44 at the end of last year but since have fallento about $17.   For 1987, Biogen lost $22.6 million on revenues of $12.5million. But revenue spiked upward this year. In the third quarter,revenue totaled $9.8 million, up from $2.69 million a year ago. Andfor the first nine months of the year, revenue jumped to $23.8million from $9.5 million a year ago.   ``This gives us a lot more flexibility in how we run thebusiness day to day,'' said Biogen Vice President and TreasurerJack Catterall. ``It's no longer crisis management.''   In over-the-counter trading Friday, Biogen rose 25 cents to$8.12{ a share.   Founded by Nobel Prize-winning Harvard University scientistWalter Gilbert and others in 1978, Biogen spent millions on diverseand costly genetic research projects and lost $101 million in theprocess.   ``Biogen started as a very high flier,'' said Andrew McVeigh, ananalyst with Rodman andamp; Renshaw Inc. in Chicago. ``Over time it lostits cache. It's fair to say they had management problems.''   Three years ago, the company brought in businessman Jim Vincentof Abbott Laboratories as its chairman, who is credited withtrimming fat and engineering a major restructuring last year.   In the shakeup, Biogen sold off research facilities inSwitzerland and Belgium, cut expenses, refocused research anddevelopment on marketable products and retained rights to newproducts rather than licensing them out.   ``The major difference ... is (Biogen) is now being managed froma more commercial and less technical perspective,'' said Biogenco-founder Phillip Sharp, director of the Center for CancerResearch at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   Clinical trials began this week at two hospitals of a new AIDSdrug called CD4 developed by Biogen scientists that doctors hopewill act as a decoy to attract the lethal virus. But competitorGenentech began clinical testing of a version of the drug severalweeks ago.   Biogen also expects approval in West Germany for geneticallyengineered gamma interferon for treatment of severe rheumatoidarthritis. It has an edge in hepatitis research thanks to a broadpatent based on research by one of its founders.   Biogen recently developed and licensed a diagnostic test andvaccine for hepatitis B, a swine growth promoter that could helpfarmers raise leaner pigs, and the anti-cancer drug alphainterferon that is sold in 43 foreign countries.   Despite a rosier financial picture, analysts said Biogen stillmust prove that its new drugs and procedures can succeed in themarketplace.</TEXT></DOC>
