Final approval in the House should come sometime next week,although no specific time has been set because leaders want tocomplete action on remaining appropriation bills before the end ofthe month.   ``Fair housing is a top priority item,'' said House MajorityWhip Tony Coehlo, D-Calif., on Thursday before the House recessedso members could attend the funeral of Rep. John J. Duncan,R-Tenn., in Knoxville.   The Senate is expected to act quickly after the House vote, thussending the measure to the White House before the end of the summer.   Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., chairman of the HouseJudiciary Committee, said, ``This legislation to finally make fairhousing a reality for so many Americans is another significant stepforward for our nation in eliminating discrimination and providingequal opportunity for all in one of our most basic human needs _housing.''   The bill would give the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment the power to bring actions on behalf of individualvictims of discrimination, would ban discrimination against thedisabled and forbid limitations on renting to families withchildren, except in clearly defined retirement communities.   The House eliminated the last controversial amendment onThursday, when members voted 289-116 to defeat a proposal by Rep.E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., that would have eliminated the provisionsprotecting families with children under age 18 from housingdiscrimination.   Shaw said that the bill's language was confusing, unenforceableand would ``wipe out every senior citizen community in thiscountry.'' Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chief sponsor, argued thatthe provision had been drafted in consultation with groupsrepresenting senior citizens and had received their full support.   Since enactment of the first federal law to ban discriminationin the sale and rental of housing in 1968, the homebuilding andsales industries have staved off repeated efforts to toughenenforcement rules. The recurring battles have embittered civilrights advocates and denied millions of families equal access todecent housing.   However, a crucial compromise was reached late last week andannounced on Tuesday that set the stage for quick passage of thebill.   Originally, the bill would have created a system ofadministrative law judges who would hear cases against allegedhousing violators when conciliation failed. The judges could awardactual damages to a plaintiff and impose fines. Any ruling could beappealed to the federal court.   The Reagan administration and the National Association ofRealtors opposed the bill because they believed that administrativelaw judges would create constitutional problems. They argued thatan accused party could be forced to pay fines and damages without ajury trial, in violation of the Constitution's Seventh Amendment.   Under the compromise, however, either the plaintiff or thedefendant can elect to go to federal court first, thus satisfyingthe objections of the administration and the Realtors.</TEXT></DOC>
