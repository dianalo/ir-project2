Manuel Antonio Noriega in illegal shipments of high-technology material from the U.S. to Cuba, a government source said.    The investigation, the third U.S. inquiry into possible illegal activities by Gen. Noriega, has &quot;just been initiated,&quot; the source said. He said the probe is focusing on allegations that Gen. Noriega facilitated, and perhaps profited from, shipments of American computer equipment and other material to Cuba through Panama.    U.S. Customs officials refused to confirm or deny a report of the investigation that appeared this week in the Los Angeles Times.    But the government source confirmed that &quot;the facts as presented in the article seem to be accurate.&quot; The Times reported that the equipment allegedly transferred to Cuba included personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp., and that it could be put to a wide range of military and scientific uses.    Neither Gen. Noriega nor spokesmen for the government of Panama could be reached last night for comment.    Two other investigations of Gen. Noriega by the Drug Enforcement Administration in Miami and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Tampa concern his alleged involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering. Gen. Noriega has been under pressure to resign from several State Department officials, who charge that his alleged corruption and ties to Cuba are destabilizing Panama. </TEXT></DOC>
