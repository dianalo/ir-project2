The Department of Energy, in its weekly inventory report, saidsupplies of crude oil and heating oil in storage were severalmillion barrels higher than those reported by the American PetroleumInstitute on Tuesday.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell 19cents to finish at $18.61 a barrel, after an 11-cent gain inWednesday's session.   Refined products traded on the exchange ended mixed, with theSeptember and October gasoline contracts closing higher. TheSeptember contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.22 cent to finish at54.15 cents a gallon and the October contract advanced 0.3 cent to51.98 cents a gallon. Contracts for later delivery declined.   Heating oil for September delivery fell 0.21 cent to settle at51.70 cents a gallon and prices of other contract months also sank.   Energy brokers said buying by major refiners, who had not beenheavy traders lately, boosted the two front-month gasolinecontracts. The majors were buying the last of the low-vapor summergasoline mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency, brokerssaid.   The EPA required refiners to make gasoline with a lowerevaporation tendency during the summer months in an effort to reduceauto emissions. The restrictions expire on Sept. 15.   Futures prices reacted early to the DOE statistics, analysts said.   ``The report started things off on a bad note,'' said Evan Baron,senior account executive with Elders Futures Inc.   The report for the week ended Aug. 18 showed that crude suppliesrose 8.9 million barrels to 340.6 million barrels, compared with a4.4 million-barrel rise to 335.2 million reported by the API.Heating oil inventories increased to 118 million barrels, a 1.5million-barrel rise, according to the DOE statistics, compared witha 1.1 million-barrel-rise to 115.6 million shown in the API report.   Traders said the DOE report could be a catalyst for weaker pricesover the next few days. Crude prices have zigzagged but remainedrelatively strong despite reports that the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries is producing more oil than the global market canabsorb.</TEXT></DOC>
