Similar gambits are quietly unfolding in other industries.    Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. and J.C. Penney Co. are launching ambitious electronic-shopping systems that could give them a valuable lock on crucial business information, though both retailers say that isn't their intention.    Like the airline systems, both &quot;electronic malls&quot; offer their owner's wares alongside those of rival retailers -- and leave open the possibility of subtle bias in the way the information appears on screens. And although a real mall operator sees only reports of his tenants' revenues, an electronic-mall operator could theoretically peer over the shoulder of every customer making a purchase.    Officials of the Sears and Penney systems say they are taking great pains to avoid bias on their networks, which are run by separate subsidiaries. They say the subsidiaries are treating all sales information confidentially, being careful not to let their parent companies have access to it.    One of the most successful electronicorder systems of any industry -- Baxter International Inc.'s hospital-supply network -- is about to undergo a similar change. Later this year, Baxter will add competitors' supplies to its network. Baxter vows to treat them fairly but dreams of a future in which all hospital supplies are ordered on its system.    In California, thousands of home buyers get electronic information about different banks' mortgage rates from a system called CompuFund. The system prints out about 10 mortgages that meet a buyer's criteria -- and every printout includes a mortgage offered by CompuFund itself. CompuFund sells more than half the loans it originates to Great American First Savings Bank, which owns about a third of CompuFund.    Such systems have &quot;totally changed the American view of marketing,&quot; comments John Thompson of the Index Group, a consulting firm. &quot;For years, the motto was 'Build a better mousetrap.' Now, it's 'Build a better path, and you can sell him anything he needs.'&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Plugging In: A Former Trader Aims To Hook Wall Street On -- and to -- His Data --- Michael Bloomberg Dreams of Making His Computers Global Bond-Market Hub --- Merrill Lynch Plays Key Role&quot; -- WSJ Sept. 22, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
