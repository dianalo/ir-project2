Inc. (products).andO;Product:   Canon LBP-4 (Computer printer).andO;Topic:     EvaluationLaser Printers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Canon USA Inc.andM;LBP-4andM;How can a page printer that resists conceding even the most basic level ofcompatibility with the reigning laser standard -- Hewlett-Packard's PCL --succeed?andP;  By offering something better, and the LBP-4 makes an intriguingoffer: scalable fonts.andM;The machine substitutes its own language, the Canon Printing System Language(CaPSL), which allows a single font definition to be enlarged or shrunk tovirtually any size on paper.andM;To help take advantage of software that might not have built-in support forCaPSL, Canon includes drivers with the LBP-4 for several popular programs,including the Windows and GEM operating environments.andM;Except for the language interface, the LBP-4 is internally identical to theLaserJet IIP.andP;  That similarity is understandable because both printers usethe same Canon laser engine.andP;  The ouput quality and performance of the twomachines proved nearly identical.andP;  To this reviewer's eye, however, the Canonprinter, in its 8-by-13.75-by-16-inch case, is more attractive than theLaserJet.andM;The paper-handling abilities of the LBP-4 may be a shortcoming in somesituations.andP;  Its built-in feed tray has a capacity of 50 sheets.andP;  Adding anoptional $195 feed tray under the printer boosts input capacity to 200sheets, but the output tray stodgily sticks with a 50-sheet limit.andP;  Theface-up tray is rated to hold only 20 pages.andP;  However, the LBP-4 handlesletter, legal, executive and A4-size sheets.andP;  It accepts envelopes throughmanual feeding.andM;The Canon engine uses a single cartridge containing the toner and imagingdrum, and it slides into place in seconds.andP;  It costs $95 and has a 3,500-pagecapacity.andM;Because the LBP-4 is not compatible with PCL, it cannot use HP soft fonts(nor is that desirable with scalable fonts).andM;In addition to the expected serial and parallel ports, the LBP-4 has a videoinput that gives direct access to the print engine.andM;The LBP-4's control panel is the most attractive of all these machines.andP;  Themechanical push-buttons provide clearly labeled control functions as well asthe more elaborate nested-menu setup.andM;The documentation looks good, but the main manual lacks an index and thetranslation from metric to English measurements is incomplete.andM;Canon USA Inc., of Lake Success, N.Y., can be reached at (516) 488-6700.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;The LBP-4 has several features that set it apart from its competitors, buyerssaid.andM;&quot;One of the desirable things about the LBP-4 is that it has scalable fonts,&quot;said Charles Stevenson, manager of the peripheral group at WordStarInternational Inc., a software manufacturer in San Rafael, Calif.andP;  &quot;Thenature of scalable fonts is to be able to change the size of the font toanything you like, and you can do that with the LBP-4.andM;&quot;I think the integrated drum and toner makes for a far cleaner change thanmultiple-cartridge setups,&quot; he added.andM;Stevenson is also pleased with the LBP-4's optional paper tray.andP;  &quot;You can putvirtually anything through the multipurpose tray that comes with the LBP-4,but you can't put a lot through it,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;With the larger, optionaltray you can put up to 200 sheets in it.andP;  It's a good buy, because you getcapacity plus the functionality of a dual-bin tray.&quot;andM;A developer of printer software at a major software house on the West Coastagreed.andP;  The optional paper tray &quot;is easy to use and it holds plenty ofpaper,&quot; said the developer, who requested anonymity.andM;He also agreed with Stevenson regarding scalable fonts.andM;&quot;That's what people want out of a PostScript printer -- scalable fonts,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;But for the LBP-4, you're paying about one-fourth the price of aPostScript printer.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
