In sharp contrast to the euphoric mood that swept the stock market, prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds declined about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Early in the day some bellwether issues were down by more than three-quarters of a point, reflecting concern about an increase in most short-term interest rates.    During the past month, some Treasury issues have slumped more than 3 1/2 points. Corporate and municipal bond prices also fell yesterday.    A rise in short-term interest rates yesterday heightened speculation that the Federal Reserve may have decided to take a slightly tougher credit stance in an effort to help the dollar in the foreign-exchange markets. The Fed's policy-making committee met last week to review its credit strategy. Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker is scheduled to give his semi-annual review of monetary policy tomorrow at a Senate Banking Committee hearing.    Nervousness about Fed policy intensified yesterday with an increase in the interest rate on federal funds, which are reserves that banks lend one another overnight. The funds rate, which is considered one of the best barometers of Fed policy, rose to an average of about 6 5/8% yesterday from an average of about 6 1/8% in recent weeks.    But the higher funds rate yesterday may have been due merely to temporary technical factors, rather than any change in Fed policy. Dealers and investors yesterday had to pay for about $29 billion of Treasury notes and bonds auctioned by the government earlier this month. Several analysts contended that these payment pressures were the major reason for the rise in the funds rate.    &quot;I don't think the Fed has tightened&quot; credit conditions, said Robert H. Ried of Ried, Thunberg andamp; Co., a Westport, Conn.-based investment research firm. He had expected the funds rate to rise yesterday because it was the settlement day for the huge volume of Treasury issues.    Nevertheless, Mr. Ried and many other analysts are apprehensive about what Mr. Volcker will say at the Banking Committee hearing. &quot;I think people expect him to emphasize the threat of inflation because of the turnaround in oil prices and the dollar's decline,&quot; Mr. Ried said.    In the credit markets, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell to 98 24/32 from 99 2/32 last Friday. That raised the yield to 7.6% from 7.58%. At one point yesterday, this issue traded as low as 98 8/32. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 declined to 99 22/32 from 99 25/32, increasing the yield to 7.29% from 7.28%. The Treasury securities market was closed in the U.S. Monday in observance of Washington's Birthday.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. fell 1.48 points to close at 1406.53. It ranged between 1399.98 and 1407.67.    Reflecting the increase in the federal funds rate, Bankers Trust Co. raised its broker-loan rate yesterday to 7 1/2% from 7 1/4%. The broker-loan rate is the fee banks charge securities dealers on loans backed by stock.    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills rose slightly from Friday's levels. But rates on new bills sold by the Treasury at its regular weekly auction were mixed compared with the previous week's sale.    The average rate on new 13-week Treasury bills at yesterday's auction declined to 5.66% from 5.72% at last week's auction. But the average rate on new 26-week bills rose slightly to 5.7% from 5.69% at the previous week's auction.    In the corporate market, a two-part, $150 million offering of Hertz Corp. notes was made through underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The package consisted of $100 million of 7 7/8% notes due 1994, priced at 99.55 to yield 7.959%, and $50 million of 7 1/2% notes due 1992, priced at 99.60 to yield 7.597%. Both portions are rated single-A-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Slated for sale today is a $200 million offering of subordinated capital notes due 1999 by Barnett Banks of Florida. A group led by First Boston Corp. priced the 8 1/2% notes at par. The issue is rated single-A-2 by Moody's and single-A by Sandamp;P.    On the municipal front, a group led by E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. tentatively priced a proposed offering of $271.2 million of revenue bonds by M-S-R Public Power Agency, Calif. The package includes bonds due in 2005, priced to yield 6.75%; bonds due in 2015, priced to yield 6.72%; bonds due in 2019, priced to yield 6.91%; and bonds due in 2021, priced to yield 6.8%.    Underwriters led by L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin tentatively priced a $100 million offering of hospital revenue bonds by the California Health Facilities Financing Authority. Under the proposed terms, the bonds would yield from 3.5% in 1987 to 6.817% in 2017. The bonds are rated double-A by Moody's.    Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                               13-Week                26-Week Applications ....... $30,299,405,000        $28,237,800,000 Accepted bids ....... $6,600,080,000         $6,632,850,000 Accepted at low price .......... 85%                    65% Accepted noncompt'ly  $1,089,820,000           $837,085,000 Average price (Rate)  98.569 (5.66%)         97.118 (5.70%) High price (Rate) ... 98.572 (5.65%)         97.128 (5.68%) Low price (Rate) .... 98.567 (5.67%)         97.118 (5.70%) Coupon equivalent ............ 5.82%                  5.95%    Both issues are dated Feb. 19.
