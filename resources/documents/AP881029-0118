Movedin advance Oct. 28 as b0514;</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Here is a list of the Energy Department'snuclear weapons production facilities by location, giving the datethey began operation, formal name, main contractor, function andesimated cost of needed environmental, health and safety measures.   The information comes from the National Defense Resources Counciland the Federation of American Scientists, two private anti-nucleargroups in Washington. The clean-up costs are the high estimates madeby the Energy Department in June.   _AIKEN, S.C., 1950, Savannah River Plant, E.I. duPont de Nemoursand Co., the largest complex in the nuclear production system andthe site of three production reactors, the only site where the mainnuclear weapons materials, plutonium and tritium, are produced. Allthree reactors have been closed for safety reasons. It is a proposedsite for a new generation military production reactor, to becompleted around the turn of the century.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $3.6 billion; $8.8 billionthereafter.   _ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., 1945, Sandia National Laboratory, ATandamp;T,performs research and development of nuclear weapons.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $232 million; $70 millionthereafter.   _AMARILLO, Texas, 1951, Pantex Plant, Mason andamp; Hanger-Silas MasonCo., the only final assembly point for nuclear warheads.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $505 million; $235 millionthereafter.   _ASHTABULA, Ohio, 1952, Ashtabula Plant, Reactive Metals Inc.Uranium from Fernald is formed into long tubes, returned to Fernald,cut, then taken to the Savannah River Plant for processing intoplutonium.   _FERNALD, Ohio, 1953, Feed Materials Production Center,Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, produces tubes of uranium fromdepleted uranium from enrichment plants tubes which are distributedto other production sites.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $1.1 billion; $1.2 billionthereafter.   _GOLDEN, Colo., 1951, Rocky Flats Plant, Rockwell International,where plutonium fabrication is conducted.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $900 million; $185 millionthereafter.   _IDAHO FALLS, Idaho, 1949, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,Exxon Nuclear Idaho Inc. and EGandamp;G Idaho Inc., conducts and processesfuel for naval reactors. The complex also has been designated a sitefor a generation military production reactor, to be completed aroundthe turn of the century.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $633 million; $2 billionthereafter.   _KANSAS CITY, Mo., 1949, Kansas City Plant, Bendix Corp.,produces non-nuclear components.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $287 million; $11 billionthereafter.   _LARGO, Fla., 1957, Pinellas Plant, General Electric Co.,manufactures neutron generators, used to initiate fission chainreaction in nuclear weapons.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $42.4 million; $9 millionthereafter.   _LIVERMORE, Calif., 1952, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,University of California, performs basic research on nuclear weapons.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $500 million; $300 millionthereafter.   _LOS ALAMOS, N.M., 1947, Los Alamos National Laboratory,University of California, carries out research and development ofnuclear weapons.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $1.6 billion; $1.5 billionthereafter.   _MIAMISBURG, Ohio, 1948, Mound Plant, EGandamp;G, produces detonatorsand other devices.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $228 million; $78 millionthereafter.   _NYE COUNTY, Nev., 1951, Nevada Test Site and the Tonopah TestRange, Reynolds Electrical andamp; Engineering Co., two sites forunderground nuclear explosions.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $634 million; $750 millionthereafter.   _OAK RIDGE, Tenn., 1941, Oak Ridge Reservation, Martin MariettaEnergy Systems, Inc. The Y-12 plant prepares highly enriched uraniumand lithium for Savannah River and also produces lithium deuterideand uranium components used in weapons. The complex is the site of agaseous diffusion plant and a national laboratory.   Maximum clean-up cost through 1995, $1.3 billion; $680 millionthereafter.   _PADUCAH, Ky., 1954, Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, MartinMarietta Energy Systems Inc., uranium enrichment complex.   _PIKETON, Ohio, 1956, Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, MartinMarietta Corp., uranium enrichment complex.   _RICHLAND, Wash., Hanford Reservation, 1944, Rockwell HanfordOperations, United Nuclear Industries Inc. Its nine productionreactors have been shut down, most recently N reactor, agraphite-moderated facility similiar in design to Soviet device inChernobyl that experienced a partial meltdown in 1986.   Maximum clean-up costs through 1995, $2.4 billion; $46 billionthereafter.</TEXT></DOC>
