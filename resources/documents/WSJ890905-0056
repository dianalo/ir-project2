Since shortly after the crash Aug. 2, 1985, Delta Air Lines Inc. has maintained that the crew of Flight 191 was insufficiently warned of the intensity of a thunderstorm that slammed the Lockheed L1011 into the ground. The crash, which occurred as the plane prepared to land at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, killed 136 people aboard the plane and one person on the ground.    The government, on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Weather Service, disputed Delta's charges from the beginning. The government's stance in this case differed sharply from its agreement to share equally in the liability arising from the July 9, 1982, crash of a Pan American World Airways Inc. Boeing 727 as it took off from New Orleans International Airport. The Pan Am crash killed 153 people.    In both the Delta and Pan Am crashes, the planes flew directly into thunderstorms in which a weather phenomenon known as wind shear caused abrupt changes in wind speed and direction. The difference in the two cases, say lawyers for the victims' families, is the control the planes' crews had over their flight paths.    In the Pan Am case, the pilots were taking off and were dependent on the air traffic controllers and meteorologists to warn them of the thunderstorm at the end of the runway. In the Delta case, the pilots had more of the responsibility for their approach for landing.    The government's refusal to share the blame for the Delta crash was ratified Friday. Judge David O. Belew ruled that while there was some breach of duty on the part of air traffic controllers and weather service personnel in failing to make certain that the Delta crew knew of the thunderstorm, the crew was in the best position to see the storm and avoid its dangers.    &quot;Controllers are not required to foresee or anticipate the unlawful, negligent or grossly negligent acts of pilots,&quot; Judge Belew wrote in his 72-page opinion, most of which summarized the 14 months of testimony he heard in the case.    The decision leaves the carrier and its insurer to shoulder the $150 million to $200 million in damages sought by the victims and their families in 182 claims. Delta, which had settled many of the claims, said it will appeal Judge Belew's decision. </TEXT></DOC>
