 Thecompany is invariably late out of the gate with their software, and what theydo release is usually met with skepticism or derision.andP;  IBM has always beenweak in delivering quality application software, yet strong in systemsoftware such as operating systems.andP;  Most users turn to third party vendorsfor their accounting, graphics and database systems.andP;  While IBM'sDisplaywrite word processing system has been partially successful, itsfollowing is largly limited to the Fortune 500.andP;  On the other hand, IBM'soperating systems, such as the mainframe-based MVS and VM and the PC-basedDOS and OS/2, are usually accepted as de facto standards as soon as theyarrive.andM;IBM has always dominated the mainframe database management system (DBMS)market.andP;  It began over 20 years ago, with development of an hierarchical DBMScalled IMS (Information Management System).andP;  Soon, other companies such asADR and Cullinet began to catch up to IBM; that's when IBM introduced therelational database manager.andM;Relational database technology was born in IBM's laboratories in the 1970s.andO;It was prototyped, proven and commercialized under IBM's System R project.andO;The project consisted of building a relational DBMS in the laboratory anddeveloping the supporting SQL relational language.andM;IBM then used its System R experience to build two mainframe relational DBMSscalled SQL/DS and DB2, both of which totally dominate the mainframerelational database management market.andP;  In just a few years, DB2 has earnedover 15 percent of the mainframe market and over half of all new sales.andO;Currently, there are more than 3,000 installed DB2 licenses and an equalnumber for SQL/DS.andP;  No other relational database manager on the mainframeeven comes close in installations.andP;  In comparison, Oracle has only about 300licences on IBM's smaller mainframe machines.andP;  IBM has been working withrelational DBMSs longer than any other vendor, and has the technology toprove it.andM;Now IBM has decided to expand into the PC database world and will probably bevery successful.andP;  Their early attempts at this market were dismal at best.andO;Several years ago they released their Personal Data Manager, a programmingproduct combined with a file manager--similar to dBASE.andP;  The product wentnowhere, and justifiably so.andP;  It lacked relational capabilities andproductivity tools, and didn't integrate with any other PC product such as1-2-3.andM;Going for the goldandM;More recently IBM introduced OS/2 Extended Edition, which includes arelational DBMS component called Database Manager.andP;  Nobody should make themistake that Database Manager is just another lukewarm attempt by IBM toenter the PC database market.andP;  Database Manager will undoubtedly be verysuccessful.andM;This product is a direct result of IBM's mainframe experience.andP;  While it hasits faults, it--along with DB2 on the mainframes and AS/400 SQL for IBM'smid-range computers--forms the foundation for IBM's distributed databasestrategy.andM;OS/2 EE contains communications and relational database managementcomponents.andP;  The Communications Manager supports various protocols, includingNetbios, LAN Server and IBM's Advanced-Program-to-Program-Communications(APPC).andP;  APPC is crucial to IBM's strategy, since it allows mainframes andmicros to talk to each other.andP;  Other protocols don't support this type ofcommunication, making them inappropriate for organizations that want toconnect micro and mainframe computers seamlessly.andP;  APPC and SQL-basedrelational database managers form the key components to distributeddatabases.andM;Distributed databases are necessary to connect information that is widelydistributed across an organization.andP;  Before the advent of micros, informationwas centralized in the MIS department and accessible through dumb 3270terminals.andP;  During the last few years, this scenario has changed.andP;  Users arestoring critical corporate data in their own personal databases, which can'tbe controlled or accessed by others.andP;  IBM recognizes that micros have created&quot;islands of information&quot; that need to be shared, but which are physicallydisconnected.andP;  This leads to inconsistent data, security breeches, lost andcorrupted data, and difficulties in data consolidation and reporting.andM;It would be folly to expect users to give up the economics and productivityof PCs and return to the centralized MIS environment.andP;  The alternative is totie the data together using relational database management software thatsupports distributed database processing.andP;  Users can retain the benefits ofPCs, while regaining the advantages of controlled data sharing.andM;The first step toward distributed databases is to store the data in similarrelational database managers.andP;  This makes linkage much easier, since thevendor-distributed relational database management system has to deal with anhomogeneous environment.andP;  Distributing a database across heterogeneousrelational database managers is much more difficult, and probably notfeasible in the near future.andM;A distributed database should be completely transparent to the programmersand users who work on them.andP;  Performance should be acceptable, and workshouldn't be interrupted when other systems access data.andP;  Finally, usersshould be able to access and update information at any local or remotedatabase without specifying physical location.andM;Distributed database technology is a tall order--extremely difficult unlessall relational database managers in the distributed network look and act thesame.andP;  IBM developed OS/2 EE's Database Manager to work cleanly with DB2.andO;Database Manager has the same system catalog structure, applicationprogramming interfaces, error codes, and optimization algorithms as DB2.andP;  Themicro database product also offers similar administration tools, which arenecessary for maintaining critical systems in corporations.andP;  It is solid,reliable, and big.andM;At first blush, Database Manager doesn't look like much.andP;  It takes up morememory than most customers will tolerate and has very poor application anduser tools.andP;  It is also only a single user system at this time.andP;  However, allthis should change.andM;OS/2 EE version 1.1 sells for $830, but the real cost pertains to its memoryand conversion requirements.andP;  Full OS/2 requires about four megabytes ofmemory (although most users don't need to load the full operating system).andP;  Isuspect, though, that over the next few years, we'll stop considering this alot of RAM.andP;  Not too long ago--almost overnight--users jumped from 64Kmachines to 640K computers.andP;  Today, extended memory isn't unusual.andP;  As memoryprices come down, users will make a similar leap to six megabyte and highersystems.andM;Conversion costs should also ease as mainstream vendors begin delivering OS/2EE support.andP;  Already many PC vendors, including DataEase International,Borland, Microsoft, Ashton-Tate and Lotus, have pledged support for DatabaseManager.andP;  IBM has also purchased the rights to a product called Metaphor,which they may port over to OS/2 EE.andP;  Metaphor is a data analysis anddevelopment tool with a graphical front end, which is very conducive toOS/2's Presentation Environment.andP;  That means current users of these vendors'products will find a ready migration path into SQL database managementtechnology.andP;  Other vendors are sure to follow.andP;  Like its mainframe siblings,OS/2 EE should become one of the most popular relational database managers inthe corporate world.andM;IBM will begin shipping OS/2 Remote Data Services (RDS), sometime inmid-1989.andP;  RDS will turn OS/2 into a multiuser database server that cancompete head-on with SQL database servers from Microsoft, Lotus, XDB, GuptaTechnologies and Novell.andP;  Given the fact that Database Manager is a criticalelement in IBM's distributed database strategy, many companies will take along, hard look at it.andP;  Over time, it should develop a strong position in thecorporate marketplace.andM;What's not clear is whether other market segments will find OS/2 equallyattractive.andP;  Customers building small networks may find great comfort inbuying hardware, operating systems and DBMS software from a single source:IBM.andP;  This would offer a stable environment totally supported by IBM.andP;  On theother hand, OS/2 EE is sure to be a relatively expensive solution to purchaseand support.andP;  After all, as a sophisticated relational database manager, OS/2EE Database Manager will require skill and experience to run.andM;I consider IBM's entry into the PC DBMS good news for users.andP;  It'll heat upthe competition and create a higher standard for reliability and stability.andO;It is a truly relational database manager that should lead the way instead offollowing.andP;  With its open architecture, the product will attract support frommany vendors, which will generate a greater variety of productivity tools forusers and programmers.andP;  In the coming decade, expect to see IBM cultivate itsdistributed database technology.andP;  The idea is compelling, and while it maynot currently deserve everyone's attention, soon the technology will demandit.andM;Rich Finkelstein is president of Performance Computing in Chicago andco-publisher of &quot;DB-Info Review,&quot;
