The second is a range of lenses barely able to split images.The third and fourth types of marginality concern two-component lensesin which one component plays the role of a background (e.g., a clusteror similar gravitational field) that affects the images split by thesecond component (e.g., a galactic or stellar gravitational field). Theorder-of-magnitude estimates of characteristic image separations andamplifications for the pair of brightest images produced by the fourkinds of marginal lenses are presented. 57 references.</TEXT></DOC>
