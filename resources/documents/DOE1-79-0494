Complete ordermeans that all oxygen positions in the perpendicular direction (alongthe a axis) are vacant. Disordering in combination with oxygen desorptioncauses the orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition at high temperatures.In the tetragonal phase with about 6.5 oxygen atoms per formula unitthe oxygen atoms are distributed over the `b' and `a' positions in equalamounts. This causes the a and b lattice parameters to be equal and leadsto the tetragonal phase. 8 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
