At least 300 Beijing University students massed outside theirdormitories Sunday night to sing sarcastic renditions of patrioticsongs and mourn those who died in the crackdown, said participatingstudents who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The students also said they were protesting that work units,especially in government offices, have rejected some graduatingseniors assigned to work for them after expressing doubts about thestudents' ideological purity.   After about an hour, the students marched to the campus areawhere students had put up thousands of political posters during thespring democracy movement, said the participants.   They said they sang and beat pots and pans in memory ofclassmates killed when government troops opened fire on protestersand their supporters.   Officials have said nearly 200-300 people died, but Chinesewitnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll mayhave been as high as 3,000.   Students at Beijing University, which has a long history ofstudent activism, were at the hub of the six-week movement.   One student said some young teachers joined Sunday's protest andlighted firecrackers before the head of the school's CommunistParty office ordered them all to go home.   The student said school officials are investigating those whoparticipated in the two-hour event, but no one had been punishedyet.   He said seniors, the only ones left on campus, feel oppressed bythe monthlong ideological study classes they have been forced toattend in order to graduate.   ``No one dares to say what he really thinks. We all have to telllies,'' he said.   The student said his classmates on Sunday night sarcasticallysang patriotic songs like ``Without the Communist Party, ThereWould Be No New China'' and repeatedly shouted ``Long Live theCommunist Party!''   No one seemed to know exactly how many students have beenrejected by work units, but a student said all but one of thoseassigned to the State Security Bureau have been rejected.   Job assignments were made in the spring before the crackdown.Most college graduates are assigned jobs by the government.   One government employee, speaking on condition of anonymity,said he was told to investigate a Beijing University studentassigned to his work unit to see if he had been active in thestudent movement.   In the central province of Anhui, party officials fired aleading professor from government and party posts.   The official Xinhua News Agency said Wen Yuankai, a professor atthe Science and Technology University in Hefei, made speechesduring the spring protests to urge students on.   Xinhua said he was fired as deputy director of the provincialeducation commission and a member of the provincial party educationgroup.   Wen is among dozens of academics punished for supporting thestudent protests or making liberal statements.   A leading figure on the government's wanted list is the formervice president of Wen's university, dissident Fang Lizhi. He wasfired from that post in 1987 amid accusations he incited an earlierround of student protests.   He is being sheltered at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where hetook refuge during the crackdown.   In the central city of Wuhan, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin,who was installed last month, said factories and other enterprisesmust make sure workers are well-trained in ideology, officialreports said Tuesday.   His comments were in keeping with the reinstatement of mandatoryideological education at workplaces.   Jiang also inspected flood prevention projects along the YangtzeRiver in the central province of Hubei on his trip Friday throughMonday, Xinhua said. Flooding has killed nearly 1,700 people insouthern and central China this summer.</TEXT></DOC>
