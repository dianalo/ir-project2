Healthcare companies are leading the pack ofbusinesses rushing to sell stock, both through initial publicofferings and followup stock sales.   Ready to make their debuts are a mixed bag of health-carebusinesses, from exotic-drug companies to hospital operators.And they are pushing their way to the head of the IPO line.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's just a terrific appetite for health-carecompanies,&quot; says Richard Franyo, managing director ofinvestment banking for Alex. Brown andamp; Sons.   The frenzied activity was evident late yesterday asCommunity Health Systems, a hospital operator, priced aninitial offering at $16 a share, up from a range of $11 to$13 envisioned last July. Also yesterday, Seattle's hotbiotechnology company Immunex filed to sell two million moreshares, and publicly traded Health Images of Atlanta, a makerof outpatient diagnostic equipment, priced two million sharesat $13.50 apiece.   A total of 21 companies in the past two weeks haveproposed to raise almost $1.1 billion through stock sales,and medical-related companies are prominent on the list,according to Securities Data Co. Five of these sales will beIPOs, the rest coming from companies that already tradepublicly.   Investors are encouraged by last year's strong performanceamong health-care stocks, widely thought to be havens fromrecession. Even if the economy recovers, money managers say,companies providing frontier medical treatments or low-costservices are likely to outperform the market.   But a 21 3/4-point plunge in Genetics Institute to 40 1/4yesterday was a breathtaking reminder that young drug andmedical technology companies can be risky investments. &quot;Thisis a very treacherous area for the public at the moment,&quot;says Cheryl Alexander of Putnam Health Sciences Trust ofBoston.   On Tuesday, Health Risk Management, public less than threemonths, lost almost one-third of its market value. TheMinneapolis provider of managed health-care services left itsinvestment banker Wessels Arnold andamp; Henderson scrambling tolower earnings estimates after the company forecast anunexpected revenue shortfall. Yesterday, Health Risk edged up3/8 to 12 3/4; it went public at 11.   Safer bets, suggests Ms. Alexander, may be found among theslew of second-time-around stock offerings recently filed byalready public companies, such as Gensia Pharmaceuticals,Xoma, ImmunoGen, Synergen, Chiron and United HealthCare.   Investors who purchase biotechnology shares in initialofferings usually have been disappointed, says MichaelGordon, manager of the Fidelity Select Biotechnology Fund ofBoston. He says it often pays to invest several years afterthe companies have gone public and proved through studies onhumans that genetically engineered drugs are safe andeffective.   A $52.5-million initial offering of RegeneronPharmaceuticals, slated for this month at $16 to $19 a share,looks a little pricey to John Kaweske, manager of theFinancial Health Sciences Portfolio of Denver. &quot;They're stillin animal trials,&quot; he says. The company, a Tarrytown, N.Y.,maker of genetically engineered products to regenerate nervedamage, faces direct competition from already publicSynergen, he cautions. But he adds: &quot;I wouldn't bet againstthem longer term.&quot;   Less risky, money managers say, are more seasonedcompanies in more predictable businesses that plan to maketheir debuts soon, such as TakeCare Inc., a Concord, Calif.,health maintenance organization, and Amsco International, aPittsburgh maker of surgical tables and lights andsterilization products.   At $16 to $18 a share, TakeCare is expected to go publicat about 10 times estimated 1991 earnings of about $1.70 ashare, says one money manager. That looks cheap compared withU.S. HealthCare, a top-performing HMO that trades at about 18times expected 1991 earnings.   Although attractive at the offering price, TakeCare couldrun into some problems in the fiercely competitive CaliforniaHMO market, says Robert Natale, emerging-growth analyst forStandard andamp; Poor's Corp. &quot;Their profit margins may not last,&quot;he says.   Money managers seem to have the same concern. They callTakeCare a good short-term but a riskier long-terminvestment.   Amsco International is coming back to the public market ata reasonable multiple, says a Boston fund manager. Thecompany's primary operating subsidiary, American SterilizerCo., was taken private in a 1985 leveraged buy-out led bymanagement and institutional investors. Formed in 1894,American Sterilizer is a leading maker of sterilizers andother products to prevent infection. Through a recentacquisition of a TRW Inc. unit, Amsco also providesengineering services for electronic clinical equipment foundin hospitals.   At $12 to $14 a share, Amsco will go public at about 14times expected 1991 earnings of about 90 cents a share, Mr.Natale says, calling the offering a good short-term buy.   But he points to some longer-term cautionary flags: thepossibility of share sales by insiders -- who will stillcontrol a big chunk of the company -- after a six-monthwaiting period; the relatively slow growth of new hospitals;and litigation, which includes an Environmental ProtectionAgency lawsuit against Amsco and 52 other parties thatallegedly deposited industrial waste at a Pennsylvania site.Amsco says that any liability resulting from the EPAcomplaint shouldn't have any adverse material effect on thecompany.   ---                   Health IPOs on Horizon                                                                                                          Here are the five largest healthcare initial publicofferings in the pipeline.
