A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows thatregistered voters approve of his job performance, 75% to 15%.Aides say the lopsided result vindicates the president'scautious, prudent approach. Fifty-nine percent approve of hiseconomic performance, his highest rating since September.</LP><TEXT>   Former Reagan aide Thomas Griscom says Bush's popularity,ironically, may be working against him in some ways. Heblames &quot;the general attitude of the country right now, one ofsatisfaction,&quot; for the president's inability to generate agroundswell of support on such issues as the capital gainstax cut and the child-care bill.   But Burton Pines of the conservative Heritage Foundationsays the president's many vetoes -- 10 in his first year, themost since Eisenhower -- are &quot;an exercise of presidentialpopularity.&quot;                                                                                                          LUCKY OR GOOD? Foreign tests may show which Bush is.   As world events from Moscow to Pretoria to Managua havebroken his way, approval of his foreign-policy performancehas steadily risen in the Journal/NBC poll. It now stands at70%, up from 58% seven months ago. Aides feel little pressureto be more forceful in responding to world events.   But tougher tests could lie ahead. An eruption inLithuania may yet alter public opinion and create pressurefor tougher steps than Bush is prepared to take. Aid forPanama and Nicaragua is caught in a Capitol Hill morass, muchto Bush's embarrassment. He may also face struggles overtrade benefits to China, military aid to El Salvador andimposing additional sanctions against South Africa.                                                                                                          CONSUMERS KEEP the economy growing, as other sectors limp.   Economists who had been fearful that consumers wereretrenching now figure spending is steady enough, whencombined with the improving trade picture, to push economicgrowth above 2% in the first quarter. &quot;Consumers have beendoing their part to hold the economy up,&quot; says retailingeconomist Rosalind Wells. But some weakness persists,especially in car sales.   The Journal/NBC poll finds consumers slightly moreoptimistic, a hopeful sign for the economy. Only 23% foreseea recession in the next year. Some 42% expect the economy tostay about as it is.   The Blue Chip survey of economists says strong consumerdemand would be the most important favorable factor forgrowth in 1991.                                                                                                          ROSTENKOWSKI'S FORMULA for balancing the budget stirslittle enthusiasm, the poll finds. When asked about a packagethat would cut defense, freeze most other programs --including Social Security -- and increase taxes, 68% say theyare opposed; only 27% are in favor.                                                                                                          NO NUKES: By 57% to 36%, voters oppose building morenuclear power plants, concluding that risks of accident andradiation leaks outweigh the reduction in air pollution overcoal- and oil-burning plants. Loosening limits on offshoreoil drilling is opposed by 54% and supported by 38%,according to the poll.                                                                                                          LIP READERS: Some 57% of voters believe Bush should stickto his no-new-taxes position, according to the Journal/NBCsurvey, while 39% think &quot;there are some things for which heshould now support&quot; higher taxes.                                                                                                          FIGHTING DRUGS remains at the top of the national agenda,the poll found in measuring the intensity of feeling on sixissues that voters consider vital. Crime, the environment andeducation also elicit strong feeling; the budget deficit andreducing health-care costs lag slightly behind.                                                                                                          BUSH FAVORS gentle treatment of Japan in coming tradedecisions.   He must decide by April 30 whether to designate as unfairunder U.S. trade law Japan's policies inhospitable to U.S.semiconductors and auto parts. Baker, Brady, Darman and chiefeconomist Boskin argue that Prime Minister Kaifu has alreadygone as far as he can in the recent agreements with the U.S.Trade representative Hills, a strong backer of tough actionlast year, takes a softer tone now.   But Commerce chief Mosbacher argues for holding Kaifu'sfeet to the fire, and the Journal/NBC poll gives him somesupport: 52% believe Japan isn't sincere about opening itsmarkets, 34% think it is. About half say the recent agreementwill make &quot;just some&quot; difference; 34% think it will matter agreat deal or quite a bit, while 11% think it won't matter atall.   This week's agreement between the two nations to negotiateAllied-Signal's trade complaint removes one difficult issueof contention, at least for now.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Guess who's coming to dinner: Given thechoice, those surveyed would rather have dinner with Bushthan with Gorbachev, 73% to 19%. . . . Among theex-presidents, Reagan and Carter are virtually tied as theguest of choice, at about a third each; only 14% chose Fordand 13% Nixon. . . . Of those who say they cast ballots in1988, only 32% own up to having voted for Dukakis; heactually got 46% of the popular vote.</TEXT></DOC>
