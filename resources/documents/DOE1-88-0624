Density-reduction grids wereemployed to lower the plasma density in the experimental region withoutaffecting the plasma source operation. The mirror cell length was reducedto a minimum to raise the bounce-averaged bad magnetic curvature. AnRF heating system was installed that raised the parallel electron andion temperatures by a factor of two, the perpendicular ion temperatureby an order of magnitude, and the trapped fraction by over a factor oftwo. These changes reduced the neutral collisionality by over a factorof two and the Coulomb collisionality by an order of magnitude, and increasedthe curvature drive by nearly an order of magnitude. A theory developeddescribes the mode in the presence of a DC radial electric field. Theobserved real frequency is in reasonable agreement with the predictionof this theory. The theory also indicates that the drive for the modehas a rotational component in addition to the curvature drive.</TEXT></DOC>
