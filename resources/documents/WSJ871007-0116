Both his Lester Roth Lecture of Oct. 25, 1984, to which you accuse me of making an &quot;incorrect reference,&quot; and the Bork testimony quoted in your own editorial make plain that Judge Bork indeed suggests that the Ninth Amendment is a provision so obscure in meaning that it gives a judge &quot;nothing more than a waterblot&quot; to construe. That his &quot;waterblot&quot; had become an &quot;inkblot&quot; by the time he testified hardly changes the meaning. More important, the key distortion arises in your claim that I have a &quot;pet project of using the Ninth Amendment as carte blanche for judges to create whatever new constitutional rights fit their fancy.&quot; This is wrong on three counts.    First, the Ninth Amendment's recognition of unenumerated rights is hardly a pet project of mine; if anything, it was James Madison's &quot;pet project.&quot; The Constitution's history -- as Judge Bork recognized in a 1968 article he wrote as Prof. Bork -- makes it clear that James Madison introduced the Ninth Amendment precisely to prevent the enumeration of specific rights in a Bill of Rights from being &quot;construed&quot; to defeat or belittle rights excluded from the enumeration. How can the Ninth Amendment's origins be ignored by those who champion &quot;original intent&quot;?    Second, I have never remotely suggested &quot;using the Ninth Amendment as carte blanche&quot; -- only using it, in light of our nation's history and the Constitution's structure and premises, to support such basic rights as privacy.    Third, you say the &quot;Supreme Court has never used the Ninth Amendment in the way&quot; I advocate. In fact, the court did exactly that in Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, a 1980 case I argued and won partly on Ninth Amendment grounds. There, Chief Justice Burger, in a plurality opinion, analogized &quot;the right of the public to attend trials&quot; to &quot;the rights of association and of privacy, . . . as well as the right to travel,&quot; all of which &quot;appear nowhere in the . . . Bill of Rights.&quot; For the chief justice, the &quot;concerns expressed by Madison and others have thus been resolved; fundamental rights, even though not expressly guaranteed, have been recognized by the court as indispensable to the enjoyment of rights explicitly defined.&quot; The &quot;project&quot; of defining such unenumerated rights -- including privacy and public access to courts -- is not mine but Madison's and the Supreme Court's. That Judge Bork rejects the entire enterprise cannot be obscured by the continuing caricature of my views on your editorial page.    Laurence H. Tribe   Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law    Harvard University   Cambridge, Mass.   ---   {In his 1984 speech, Judge Bork took up the challenge of what a judge should do &quot;when his studies leave him unpersuaded that he understands the core of what the Framers intended?&quot; He said, &quot;When the meaning of a provision . . . is unknown, the judge has in effect nothing more than a waterblot on the document before him. He cannot read it; any meaning he assigns is no more than judicial invention. . . .&quot;    To this point in the speech there had been no mention of the Ninth Amendment. Later in the speech, Judge Bork took up another challenge, citing one author's argument that &quot;the Constitution's text contains several provisions with an invitation 'to look beyond their four corners.'&quot; This invitation was found, for example, in the Ninth Amendment: &quot;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&quot;    From these words the author, Judge Bork went on, &quot;moves to the conclusion that the amendment instructs judges to construct constitutional rights not found elsewhere in the document. If that was what he intended, one would think Madison would have had the wit to say so. . . . Any such power would have been hotly debated at the convention and in the ratification struggle. There is no trace of such a discussion. . . .&quot; He concluded, &quot;There are alternative explanations of the Ninth Amendment, but if it ultimately turns out that no plausible interpretation can be given, the only recourse for a judge is to refrain from inventing meanings and ignore the provision, as was the practice until recently.&quot;    At his confirmation hearings, Judge Bork elaborated on the most prominent of the &quot;alternative explanations,&quot; saying the Founders might have intended the amendment to mean &quot;the enumeration of these {rights} does not entitle judges to override the state constitutional rights. They also might have had in mind perhaps a fixed category of what they regarded as natural rights, although if they did have in mind a category of natural rights, I am a little surprised they did not spell it out and put it into the Constitution.&quot; -- Ed.} </TEXT></DOC>
