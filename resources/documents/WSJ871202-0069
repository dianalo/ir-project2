A Senate subcommittee yesterday approved without discussion a provision that would allow foreign countries, primarily Israel and Egypt, to refinance at current, lower rates, billions of dollars of loans made by the federal government at high interest rates earlier this decade. The loans would be refinanced as private bonds, 90%-guaranteed by the federal government. It's estimated that these bonds could total $7 billion, probably $5 billion from Israel.    The plan, which is opposed by the Treasury, would result in the loss to the federal government of more than $1 billion of foregone interest payments over the term of the loans, according to congressional and administration officials. It would, however, be a boon to the countries that hold the loans, and to the investment bankers who have been vying for the underwriting business involved in the refinancing.    The subcommittee also voted to bar the sale of Stinger missiles to Bahrain.    And a separate subcommittee voted to chop the military budget by retiring the Navy's oldest aircraft carrier, the USS Midway. The Navy had planned to keep the World War II-era ship in operation until 1997, but the panel reasoned that it could save as much as $4.5 billion over the decade by mothballing the vessel in fiscal 1988. The move was part of a defense appropriations bill providing for spending of $285 billion in fiscal 1988, a level consistent with last month's budget compromise.    The refinancing proposal is the second big-dollar plan of its kind that lawmakers are pushing this year as part of the deficitcutting package. The other is a $5 billion refinancing plan that involves government loans to rural electrification cooperatives.    Proponents of the plans contend the refinancings reduce the budget deficit in the current fiscal year by paying off the government's loans in cash up front. They also would relieve the borrowers of burdensome, high-interest loans.    But critics say the transactions are really significant revenue losers in the long run. The government would lose the higher interest payments that it expected to receive over the 20- or 30-year terms of the loans and would still be forced to back the refinanced loans issued by private lenders.    The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reducing law doesn't allow such refinancing arrangements to be counted as savings.    Treasury Secretary James Baker has criticized both plans. &quot;We oppose such refinancing because of the costs to the taxpayer (and) continued exposure of the American taxpayer to the borrower's defaulting,&quot; Mr. Baker stated in a letter to lawmakers referring to the Israel and Egypt proposal. He added, &quot;The proposal would set a highly undesirable precedent that could cost the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.&quot;    The plan moves to the full Senate Appropriations Committee, which could approve it as early as tomorrow.    The provision was part of a $13.6 billion measure that would finance the government's foreign aid operations in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Major parts of the bill are direct grants to Israel and Egypt.    According to committee staff, Israel would receive $1.8 billion in military aid and $1.2 billion in economic assistance. Egypt would get $1.3 billion in military aid and $815 million in economic assistance. These figures echo requests made by the Reagan administration and the figures contained in an appropriations measure in the House. The refinancing proposal would be a benefit in addition to these sums.    The U.S. has nearly $19 billion in loans outstanding to foreign governments for the purchase of military equipment and services. More than half of these loans were made when interest rates exceeded 10%. The Reagan administration and lawmakers have been grappling for years with ways to reduce these loans.    Of about $8 billion in loans to Israel, approximately $5 billion could be classed as high-interest, according to congressional officials. Of about $4 billion in loans to Egypt, perhaps $3 billion are at high interest rates. Turkey has about $800 million in high-interest loans from the federal government.    It is difficult to predict how much of these would be refinanced under the proposal. But one congressional estimate places the potential benefit in foregone interest payments to Israel alone at $1.2 billion.    The foreign aid bill's ban on plans by President Reagan to sell Stinger antiaircraft missiles to Bahrain was vigorously opposed by the administration, which is eager to please Bahrain, one of the U.S. government's closest allies in the volatile Persian Gulf.    The amendment was offered by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), who argued that he feared the potent weapons system might fall into the hands of U.S. enemies.    The Navy budget move pares back one of the most visible components of the Reagan military buildup -- the maintenance of 15 carrier battle groups. Under the plan advanced by former Navy Secretary John Lehman, the U.S. would have 15 carriers beginning in 1991; assuming the Senate cuts stick, the U.S. will have only 14 until 1997.    While demanding that the Navy retire the Midway, the Senate subcommittee did approve funds for the Navy to begin work on two new aircraft carriers, which would be delivered in 1997. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) pushed the plan to couple the new carrier funds to an earlier-than-planned retirement for the Midway, an approach he labeled &quot;pay as you go.&quot; In fact, savings from the Midway's retirement won't cover the costs of the new carriers, which exceed $6 billion.    The Midway was a ready target for budget-cutters. In addition to its age, the ship needed about $80 million of repair work. Last year, the Navy found that the Midway rolled too much in high seas, causing problems for the carrier-based aircraft that land on its deck.    The plan for 15 carriers was also pushed further into the future because of other cuts in the military budget. A recent study by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the 15 carriers were in place by 1994, the Navy would have 176 fewer aircraft and 22 fewer escort ships than it needed. &quot;There's no point in building aircraft carriers if we can't protect them and support them,&quot; Sen. Kennedy said.    ---   Tim Carrington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
