The report, which named 43 drug-trafficking organizationsranging from the Medellin cartel to the Hell's Angels motorcyclegang, divulged information only on completed investigations andprosecutions, not ongoing projects.   U.S. Attorney Charles W. Larson of the Northern District of Iowasaid, ``Ironically, it seems to be proportionally as bad there forus as anywhere. Although we have very, very few disenfranchisedpeople in a state such as Iowa, we still have more than our fairshare of drugs.''   Larson recounted the story of an Iowa farmer who was arrestedseveral years ago ``running out his back door with a kilo ofcocaine under his arm and no clothes.''   Larson said the drug trafficking _ done mainly by Iowans whohave moved to states on the nation's borders or who have friends inthose states _ has bred increasing violence in the state, including``three or four cases that involved hired killers.''   ``One drug dealer was going to have an informant killed, hiredtwo people to come down from Minnesota,'' he said. ``Unfortunately,they were going to kill the wrong informant, but fortunately, westemmed that, literally in the parking lot.   ``To give you an idea of how violent they can become, they hadtaken steps to rent a woodchipper to dispose of the body once theyhad killed him,'' Larson said.   In three years, the Northern District of Iowa's federalOrganized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force has prosecuted and sentto prison more than 200 people for drug crimes, including herointrafficking.   Thornburgh said the compilation _ prepared for President Bushand for William J. Bennett, the director of the Office of NationalDrug Control Policy _ might help develop a national drug controlstrategy, which is due Sept. 5.   ``What we have found is that these crime conglomerates operatewith various degrees of structure and sophistication,'' he said.``They include highly publicized international operations such asthe Colombia Medellin cartel as well as other groups operating on aregional basis such as the Dixie Mafia based in Georgia and theMiami Boys gang in Florida.   ``A common denominator of these organizations, however, is greed_ their relentless pursuit of money,'' Thornburgh said.   `` ... One of the salient features of this report is thechanging nature of organized crime in this country,'' he said. ``Nolonger are we talking about the traditional organized crimefamilies only. We're talking about new organizations, the Crips andthe Bloods, Asian organizations, the Jamaican posses, themotorcycle gangs.''   Bennett, in an interview after the news conference, said hereally didn't learn anything new from the report.   ``I've educated myself about this beforehand and I knew aboutthese operations, but I think it's very interesting to see theextent of these investigations, that they extend all over thecountry, that the stereotype _ just big urban areas _ is mistaken,that crack is everywhere, and that we're making some progress,''Bennett said.</TEXT></DOC>
