There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing. The petitioner subsequently submitted a revised section F proposing establishmentof tolerances for residues of chlorimuron ethyl in or on peanut nutmeatsat 0.02 ppm and peanut hulls at 0.05 ppm. Because these tolerances do notresult in any increased risk to humans over those previously filed, a periodof public comment is not necessary. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The data considered in the petition include several acute studies,a 90-day feeding study in mice fed dosages of 0, 3.75, 18.75, 187.5, and750 milligrams/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day) with a no-observable-effect level(NOEL) of 18.75 mg/kg/day; a 90-day feeding study in dogs fed dosages of0, 2.5, 37.5, and 187.5 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day; a 1-yearfeeding study in dogs fed dosages of 0, 0.625, 6.25, and 37.5 mg/kg/daywith a NOEL of 6.25 mg/kg/day; an 18-month chronic feeding study in micefed dosages of 0, 1.875, 18.75, and 187.5 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 18.75mg/kg/day and no oncogenic effects observed under the conditions of thestudy at doses up to and including 187.5 mg/kg/day (highest dosage tested(HDT)); a chronic feeding (oncogenicity) study in rats fed 0, 1.25, 12.5,and 125 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 12.5 mg/kg/day and no oncogenic effectsobserved under the conditions of the study at doses up to and including125 mg/kg/day (HDT); a two-generation reproduction study in rats fed dosagesof 0, 1.25, 12.5, and 125 mg/kg/day with a maternal NOEL of 12.5 mg/kg/dayand a fetotoxic NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day; a teratology study in rats feddosages of 0, 30, 150, and 600 mg/kg/day with a teratogenic NOEL of 150mg/kg/day, a fetotoxic NOEL of 30 mg/kg/day, and a maternal toxicity NOELof 30 mg/kg/day; a teratology study in rabbits fed dosages of 0, 15, 60,and 300 mg/kg/day with a maternal toxicity NOEL of 60 mg/kg/day, a fetotoxicNOEL of 15 mg/kg/day, and no teratogenic effects at 300 mg/kg/day (HDT);and a battery of mutagenicity testing (Ames test, <T3>in vivo </T3>bone marrow assay, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay),all negative. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) based on the two-generation rat reproductionstudy (NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day) and using a hundredfold safety factor iscalculated to be 0.013 mg/kg/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution(TMRC) for this tolerance for a 1.5-kg diet is calculated to be 0.000001mg/day and will utilize 0.01 percent of the ADI. Published tolerances utilize0.01 percent of the ADI.No desirable data are lacking. The nature of the residue is adequately understood, and  an adequate analyticalmethod (high-pressure liquid chromatography using a photoconductivity detector)is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead time from establishing this tolerance to publicationof the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide Analytical Manual II, aninterim analytical methods package is being made available to State pesticideenforcement chemists when requested from: <T3>By mail: </T3>Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field OperationsDivision (H7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. <T3>Office location and telephone number: </T3>Rm. 242, CMandplusmin;2, 1921Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-557-4432. There are currently no actions pending against registration of this chemical.Negligible secondary residues are expected to occur in meat, milk, poultry,or eggs from this use. Based on the information considered by the Agency, it is concluded thatthe tolerance will protect the public health and is established as setforth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may,  within 30 days afterthe date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. M-3708 (A-110), 401 M St., SW., Washington,DC 20460. Such objections should be submitted in quintuplicate and specifythe provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds forthe objections. If a hearing is requested, the objections must state theissues for the hearing. A hearing will be granted if the objections arelegally sufficient to justify the relief sought. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulationfrom OMB requirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to section 8(b)of that Order. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have significanteconomic impact on substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect  was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="20">(Sec. 408(d)(2), 68 Stat. 512 (21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(2)).)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
