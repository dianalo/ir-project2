In thisstudy, the authors examine the relative impact on HUD and PHAs of fourretrofit financing strategies used by two local housing authorities.They find that the existing Performance Funding System (PFS) regulationstend to discourage PHAs from actively pursuing cost-effective investmentsthat improve the energy efficiency of their housing projects. The authors'results indicate that HUD policies distribute the dollar savings fromconservation retrofits in such a way that HUD receives substantial benefits,while local public housing authorities get few benefits. In fact, PHAscan lose money, even in cases where there are significant energy savingsand payback periods of less than three years. The authors tested severalalternatives to the current regulations and found that the best way toencourage PHAs to conserve is for HUD to reimburse them for new maintenanceand capital costs of the conservation retrofits.</TEXT></DOC>
