In Moscow, lawmakers recommended changes in constitutionalamendments that have touched off the furor in Lithuania and theother Baltic republics, iet republic's aEstonia and Latvia, because oflimits theyplace on the republics' powers, the daily Pravda said.   The amendments were proposed by Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev as the keystone of his political reform program, whichincludes the creation of a more powerful presidency and a full-timenational legislature.   In Vilnuis, the Lithuanian Movement for Perestroika's call for a10-minute noon protest halted traffic in the city center, and about10,000 people rallied on the city's Gediminas Square, said movementspokeswoman Rita Dapkus.   Alvydas Medalinskas, the movement's acting secretary, addressedthe crowd from a balcony and called for the removal of three membersof Lithuania's Communist Party Central Coithuanian words meaning ``forshame, for shame,'' to criticize theinaction of their republic's lawmakers, Ms. Dapkus said.   Medalinskas told the crowd that what happened on Friday ``wasdetrimental not only to the (Lithuanian Perestroika) movement, butto all of Lithuania,'' she said.   The grassroots movement has called for another meeting ofLithuania's Supreme Soviet by Nov. 29, and is collecting signatureson petitions that call for such a session.   What Ms. Dapkus called a ``symbolic strike'' was to last for 10minutes throughout Lithuania. She said traffic had come to astandstill in Vilnius, but there was no word yet from Lithuania'sother cities.   Police in central Vilnius took no steps to interfere with therally on Gediminas Square, she said.   Ms. Dapkus, who is from Chicago, said she will be leaving theSoviet Union this week to set up an information bureau for theLithuanian movement in the United States.   Pravda said today that a commission of the Supreme Soviet hadrecommended modifications in amendments to the Constitution thatwere proposed by Gorbachev and the national leadership as anapparent attempt to placate the Baltic republics.   As originally written, the amendment to Article 108 authorizes anewly created Council of People's Deputies to ``take decisionsrelative to the composition of the U.S.S.R., the approval of theformation of new autonomous republics and autonomous regions in thecomposition of the union republics.''   The commission recommended that article be changed to limit thecouncil to questions ``of national-state structure relative to thejurisdiction of the U.S.S.R.''   Article 108 also authorized the council to annul legislation andacts of the Soviet republics if they contradict the Constitution.The commission, which met Saturday, recommended that such languagebe stricken as part of an effort to increase ``the development ofthe sovereign rights of the republics,'' Pravda said.   However, the lawmakers also condemned the action of the EstonianSupreme Soviet, saying its decision on Wednesday to give local lawsprimacy over Soviet legislation was at odds with the 1977 SovietConstitution.   Their ruling was transmitted to the Supreme Soviet Presidium, thenation's highest executive body, possibly presaging a striking downof the Estonian decision by the Kremlin leadership.   Estonia, Lithuania and the third Baltic republic, Latvia, wereindependent after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution until 1940, whenthey were annexed by the Soviet Union.   The small Westward-looking republics have used President MikhailS. Gorbachev's political reforms _ dubbed ``perestroika'' _ to pushfor greater economic and cultural autonomy.   Baltic residents contend that proposed amendments to the SovietConstitution will limit their autonomy.</TEXT></DOC>
