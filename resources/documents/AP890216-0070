A group of influential activists accused Mrs. Mandela, wife ofjailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, of``violating human rights ... in the name of the struggle againstapartheid.''   It was the first public denunciation of Mrs. Mandela by thesenior leadership of the anti-apartheid movement.   Mrs. Mandela and a group of young supporters, known as theMandela United soccer club, are under investigation in the death ofa teen-age black activist who disappeared after allegedly beingbeaten at Mrs. Mandela's home in the Soweto township.   Police and community leaders say the activist, Stompie Seipei,14, led a ``children's army'' of 1,500 black children in theTumahole township of the Orange Free State and became a legend inthe racial unrest of 1984-87.   He was jailed under emergency rules at age 10, the youngest ofthe thousands detained, and held for 11 months.   Two other slayings, one of a Mandela United member and the otherof a prominent anti-apartheid physician, also are being investigatedby police as part of the case.   The police investigation is the latest in a series ofcontroversies in recent years that have dogged Mrs. Mandela.   Many black activists used to call her ``Mother of the Nation,''but Mrs. Mandela's erratic behavior and reluctance to coordinate heractions with black leaders have alienated many supporters.   ``Mrs. Mandela has abused the trust and confidence which she hasenjoyed over the years,'' said Murphy Morobe, a spokesman for thebanned United Democratic Front, the country's largest anti-apartheidgroup.   ``Numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflictbetween Mrs. Mandela and the (black) community,'' he said. ``Onevery occasion Mrs. Mandela has refused to cooperate and has chosento disregard the sentiments of the community.''   Morobe emphasized that anti-apartheid leaders ``reaffirm ourunqualified support for our leader, Nelson Mandela, and call for hisimmediate release.''   Mandela, the country's best known black leader, has beenimprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotageand plotting to overthrow the white-led government.   Joining Morobe at the news conference were other leaders of theUnited Democratic Front, prominent anti-apartheid lawyers, andofficials of the militant Congress of South African Trade Unions,the largest black labor federation.   Morobe noted that Mrs. Mandela has faced severe hardships, suchas being separated from her husband for 27 years, raising her twodaughters alone, living under a series harsh police restictions, andspending 18 months in solitary confinement without charge.   ``We pay tribute to her contribution,'' said Morobe, adding thatit had been a painful decision for black leaders to speak outagainst Mrs. Mandela.   But he said her actions repeatedly violated the principles of theanti-apartheid movement.   He specifically cited Mandela United a group of youths who seldomplay soccer, but have served as Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards since sheformed the team in 1986.   ``We are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has beenassociated with,'' Morobe said. ``Not only is Mrs. Mandelaassociated with the team, in fact, the team is her own creation.''   Morobe conceded that the government will use the criticismagainst Mrs. Mandela as a ``propaganda point.''   Morobe said black leaders did not seek to create a division inthe black community and called on people to distance themselves fromMrs. Mandela ``in a dignified manner.''   Mrs. Mandela could not immediately be reached for comment. Awoman at Mrs. Mandela's Soweto office said she was not available.   Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, said he did not think Mandela wasaware of today's denunciation of his wife.   Mrs. Mandela returned to Johannesburg on Wednesday after an80-minute meeting at a prison farm near Cape Town with her husband.After her return, police stopped the van carrying her back to Sowetoand impounded the vehicle on the highway.   While Mrs. Mandela, her daughter and granddaughter hitched a ridewith a journalist, police took into custody a young man accompanyingher, but they later released him.   Police Capt. Ruben Bloomberg said the van had been seized forinvestigation into the slaying of Stompie, whose decomposed body wasidentified in a police morgue Wednesday through fingerprints.   ``We are outraged at Mrs. Mandela's complicity in the recentabductions and assault of Stompie,'' Morobe said. ``Had Stompie andhis three colleagues not been abducted by Mrs. Mandela's `footballteam,' he would have been alive today.''   Mrs. Mandela had no comment about her meeting with her husband orthe controversy that has surrounded her since three youths told acommunity meeting in Soweto that they had been abducted and taken toher home, where they were beaten. They said Stompie was with them,but had been beaten more severely, and was taken away after a coupleof days.   The three youths, according to their attorney, said Mrs. Mandelawas involved in the events.   She has denied being at home at the time, but has defended theabduction, saying the three men and the teen-ager were taken from aMethodist Church residence last month to protect them from sexualabuse.   The church has denied the charge.</TEXT></DOC>
