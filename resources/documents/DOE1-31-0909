It is believed that prognostic monitoring techniquesmay provide a viable alternative to replacing or refurbishing equipmentto facilitiate operation of commercial light water reactors beyond 40years. One segment of this effort has been directed at emergency dieselsystems, with the emergency diesel-driven pumps at the N-reactor servingas the specific items of interest. The N-reactor diesels are similarin size, operating requirements, and operating history to those in commercialplants. In addition, the N-reactor diesels have been in service longerthan any of the commercial units and are therefore valuable from a viewpointof aged equipment analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
