Arix is actively broadening its customer base andincreasing marketing and research and development expenditures as the companyexpands its sales channels, enters new markets and bids on governmentcontracts.andM;- o -andM;Commenting on its vanished profits on sales down 40% (see Company Results)Micron Technology Inc says that turnover and profit were affected bydecreasing prices and Micron's transition from the 256K to 1M memory chips;on the plus side, the Boise Idaho company, where Amstrad Plc has 9%, has thismonth been awarded an S1 supplier rating by NCR, the highest of NCR's sixlevels of supplier ratings in its programme for quality and service and thefirst for a chip company.andM;- o -andM;In a reminder of just how big the computer industry is - and how big thecompanies in it are relative to other industries - next Wednesday, Standard andamp;Poor's Corp makes a change in the composition of the Sandamp;P 500 share index,which although less well known is almost as widely followed as the Dow JonesIndustrial Index (which is hardly representative any more since it includesonly 30 shares): out goes Ramada Inc, the hotel operator that isrestructuring and selling its hotels, and in comes Autodesk Inc, theSausolito, California personal computer aided design software specialist,where annual sales are running at some $170m these days; the move is goodnews for Autodesk shareholders because many funL are constrained to buy onlyshares in the Sandamp;P 500, and Autodesk will gain higher visibility and gravitas.andM;- o -andM;Sage Group Plc shares made a chirpy start when trading began on the Full Listlate last week: placed at 130 pence, they opened at 145 pence and ended theirfirst day at 146p.andM;- o -andM;The first two AppleCenters in Japan were opened on Thursday by Ado DenshiCorp and System Soft Inc: AppleCenters sell the Apple Computer Inc line and arange of third-party hardware and software to provide complete systems forany customer, provide training, support, service and consultations and areowned and operated by a reseller;

theinformation was read at 3.5M-bytes-per-second and the measured error rateswere one in 1,000m, decreasing to one in 10,000,000m when using standarderror correction codes: a thin film recording head was used, with aninductive write element and a magnetoresistive read element and by monitoringthe rapid resistance changes that occur as the head passes over recordedmagnetic bits it is possible to detect bits too small for a conventionalall-inductive head to recognise: the head is similar in principle to theindustry's first magnetoresistive head used in the 3480 Tape Subsystem in1984; the demonstation also relied on a recording technique known as thePartial Response, Maximum Likelihood channel, which enables significantlygreater bit density.andM;- o -andM;Rank Xerox (UK) Ltd, Uxbridge, Middlesex, is saying it has combinedphotocopying, printing, scanning and facsimile services into a single IBMpersonal computer-compatible product: designed to operate on the Xerox 7021facsimile machine, the Xerox Faxmaster 21 software can scan paper-baseddocuments and send them to a word processing or desktop publishing file forfurther manipulation - conversely, documents sourced from a personal computercan be directly transmitted by facsimile to up to 999 different locations;store-and-forward and job reservation features allow documents to bepre-programmed for transfer at off-peak rates, while remote users canretrieve documents by dialing a private access code; the complete package,including the 7021 transceiver, the new software and RS232 cable comes in ata hefty #3,650, although existing Xerox 7021 users can buy the Faxmaster 21software as a separate add-on feature for #500.andM;- o -andM;Unkind observers are saying that it stands to reason US Memories has not beenable to rustle up the financing it wants to get its memory chip business offthe ground under IBMer Sanford Kane (CI No 1,327) - IBM is never able to getthe money it wants from anybody these days.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
