The Sovietauthorities must have concluded that Western outrage would bemuted if the Baltics were suppressed while war raged in thePersian Gulf. The Kremlin also knows that Mikhail Gorbachev'sNobel-capped popularity has diminished the influence ofSoviet human rights monitors in the West.   The Gorbachev era has been disorienting for rights groupsconcerned with the Soviet Union. While traditional coerciveinstruments have receded, neither the structures nor theindividuals responsible for past crimes have disappeared.That attacks on Lithuania and Latvia can proceed even as100,000 Muscovites protest, illustrates the partial characterof glasnost.</LP><TEXT>   One group of scholar-activists, headquartered inAmsterdam's Second World Center, has been particularly astuteat making the shift from old-fashioned human rights lobbyingto reinforcing Soviet reformers. They have also beendepressingly accurate in their assessments of the fate ofSoviet democracy.   A modest townhouse in central Amsterdam is the nervecenter for three enterprises: the Center, which grew from its1971 roots as the Committee to Save Vladimir Bukovksy; theInternational Association on the Political Abuse ofPsychiatry (IAPUP), founded a decade ago to alert the worldmedical community to the psychiatric molestation ofdissidents; and the Second World Bookstore.   The driving force behind the Center is 31-year-old RobertVan Voren, a historian who was inspired to human rights workafter reading &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; in his youth. Mr.VanVoren recalls the first of his 30 trips to the Soviet Union:&quot;It was during the first wave of dissident arrests prior tothe Moscow Olympics. On my last trip the dissidents werestill around, but now they are members of parliament.&quot; Sincethen, the Center has helped to liberate dozens of dissidents,established ties with democratic groups such as theantiStalinist historical society Memorial, shipped officesupplies to Lithuania and forged exchange programs withSoviet progressives such as Yuri Afanasyev.   But now Center specialists are expressing alarm about thecontinued clout of the communist elites. IAPUP, which wasinstrumental in the World Psychiatric Association's 1983 moveto censure the Soviet psychiatric establishment, has chartedthe career paths of abusive psychiatrists. While some havebeen moved around, few have been disciplined and none havebeen criminally prosecuted as yet, and the Serbsky Institutethat supplied the Brezhnev regime with invented mentalillnesses like &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot; still exists.   While the Center is deluged by Soviet reporters, iteschews the normal pampering of the Western press. Centerofficers value their contacts with press-shy Soviet activistsmore than publicity. According to Mr. Van Voren, most Soviets&quot;go from the starting point that all Western journalist don'tknow what is going on,&quot; and are suspicious of Westernreporters who are less critical of Gorbachev than evenofficial Soviet scribes.   This has sometimes enabled other human rights groups toclaim credit for the Center's work. In April 1990, when adelegation of Soviet psychiatrists was scheduled to visitWashington under official U.S. auspices, IAPUP provided faxdata that exposed some of the visitors as abusers. Theinvitation was revoked and another well-known &quot;watch&quot; grouppromptly called a press conference to trumpet thecancellation.   Amid the cramped hallways behind the bookstore, the mostlyvolunteer staff frets about Moscow's new democracy builders.Nancy Adler, author of the Center's forthcoming biography ofMemorial, chillingly describes an urban democratic activistwho keeps all his files in an open suitcase on his desk, &quot;thebetter to make a quick exist when the crackdown comes.&quot; Adeputy of the Russian parliament visiting the Center recentlysaid he would not be surprised if &quot;thousands&quot; of newpsychiatric prisoners were incarcerated in the event of aKGB-led reaction.   Even before the Shevardnadze resignation alertedWesterners to the &quot;coming dictatorship,&quot; people at the Centerwere disturbed by the language of Mr. Gorbachev and KGB bossVladimir Kryuchkov, whose speech decrying &quot;foreign interests&quot;occurred while Western food convoys were being sent toMoscow. Mr. Van Voren thinks it curious that food shortagesare most acute in those areas where reformers have taken overmunicipal governments. &quot;Blockade,&quot; not &quot;shortage,&quot; was theword heard repeatedly to describe the food situation -- anassessment shared by deputy Moscow Mayor Sergei Stankevichand other democrats.   While &quot;the best situation would be that the Second WorldCenter doesn't have the need to exist,&quot; Mr. Van Vorenidentifies several political and psychiatric reform goals.IAPUP has a researcher in Moscow adding to the archives ofits Biographical Dictionary, scheduled for a Russian-languagepublication later this year. The Center has expanded itsreach outside of Moscow, working with journalists in Kiev andLvov to set up an Independent Ukrainian Press Agency. Bothgroups continue to publish their latest information.   On the future of the crumbling union, the consensus of theCenter's specialists is that it will take more than ageneration for a democratic culture to take root in theSoviet Union. The creation of new democrats from the vestigesof Lenin's &quot;new Soviet man&quot; is beyond the capability of anyhuman rights group. In the wake of Vilnius and Riga, theWestern world may elevate human rights' position on theEast-West diplomatic agenda. If so, other Western crusaderscould learn a great deal about persistence and adaptationfrom the small band around the corner from Anne Frank's housein Amsterdam.   ---   Mr. Bodie is a New York philanthropic consultant whochairs the Manhattan Institute Seminar on InternationalAffairs.</TEXT></DOC>
