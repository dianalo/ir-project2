BERGSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Break out the Dramamine. Executives are climbingback into the company planes from which many last alighted in theearly 1980s recession.   Economic turbulence sent corporate aviation into a nose dive, andthe end of the federal investment tax credit on purchases of companyplanes created an additional downdraft for the industry.   But it's finally showing signs of pulling out, says Robert G.Carnell, one of seven directors of the National Air TransportationAssociation, which represents about 1,500 charter companies andflight service operations nationally.   Some companies are going back to private planes to improve theirschedule options and lessen luggage hassles with commercialairlines. In addition, corporations are leaner, Carnell said, and``they're trying to have fewer people cover more plants.''   With a private plane, he said, ``You can go in and out of a plantin Alabama (from Detroit) in a day. By airlines it's a day and ahalf or more.''   The General Aviation Manufacturers Association in WashingtonD.C., said 157 new business jets were delivered in 1988, up 28.7percent from the 122 delivered in 1987. Sales of turboprops, usedalmost exclusively by businesses, were up 10.6 percent in 1988 over1987, to 291 planes delivered from 263.   There are other favorable signs.   Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. Travel Data Centersurveys indicate 35 million business travelers were delivered todestinations by 52,000 corporate and executive aircraft in 1987, thelatest surveys available. That was 2 million more travelers than in1986.   ``Overall, it's finally starting to come back after 10 years ofdisastrous sales on new airplanes,'' said Carnell, who is presidentof Corporate Flight Inc. in Detroit, which manages planes forcorporations.   About 50 companies keep planes at John Wayne Airport in OrangeCounty, Calif., and the number remains fairly constant because ofspace limitations, said Sue Anderson, manager of Millionnaire flyingservice, one of the airport's three fixed-base operators _ companiesthat fuel and service corporate and private planes.   Demand for more space is high. Millionnaire is planning to builda new hangar scheduled for occupancy in January, Anderson said.   ``We've got people wanting to put aircraft in that hangar andwe've not even broken ground yet.''   Millionnaire's fuel sales to private planes, most of thembusiness planes, have increased from about 1.1 million gallons ayear when the company began five years ago to 1.5 million gallonslast year, she said.   In the Cleveland area, charters and used aircraft sales picked upas the economy rallied, said Jim Barber, manager of Mercury AviationInc. at Cuyahoga County Airport, where electronics and auto partsmaker Eaton Corp. and aerospace and defense company TRW Inc. haveair fleets based.   Bausch andamp; Lomb Inc. recently built a new aviation facility andhangar and Eastman Kodak Co. expanded its facility at Monroe CountyAirport near Rochester, N.Y., airport assistant manager FrederickIekel said.   ``Corporate flying is up,'' said Jim Keogh, manager of the ButlerAviation Inc. facility at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, though hecouldn't provide separate figures on company planes.   Business flights also are increasing at Detroit's City Airport,an early corporate aviation center still used by thousands ofcompany planes.   ``About half of the Fortune 500 companies land here at least oncea year,'' airport director Lillian Snyder said.   City Airport counted 137,000 landings and takeoffs last year,when construction kept the airport closed many nights and weekends.This year, Snyder said the figure is expected to grow to 170,000.   Carnell said his company, Corporate Flight, manages planes for ahalf-dozen companies, making them available when needed andchartering them at other times to help pay expenses.   ``There's no perfect airplane,'' Carnell said. ``A company willhave one plane, maybe a Beech King Air. Occasionally they might needa Lear Jet. With a group like mine they can interchange and use theright plane for the right mission.''   As a rule, about one-third of general aviation aircraft are usedfor business, said Richard Lampl of the National Business AircraftAssociation.   An association survey of its members found that the number ofhours flown per business jet has increased since 1987 from 425.5hours a year to 441.8 hours a year last year. The associationestimates each jet will be used an average of 483 hours for businessthis year.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday July 9</NOTE></DOC>
