Police firing tear gas battled students in campus and streetclashes marking the anniversary of the April 19, 1960, studentrevolt that toppled the Syngman Rhee government. Violent protestswere reported in Seoul, Kwangju, Chonju, Chungju, Pusan, Taejon,Wonju, Kangnung, Chunchon and Iri.   ``Execute Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Yankee go home!'' studentsscreamed as they beat drums and brass gongs.   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said about 37,000 studentstook part in protests at 112 colleges nationwide, but it did notsay how many were violent. Police said they had no overall figureson the protests.   Several police officers and students were injured, but policeofficials in Seoul said they had no details on injuries or arrests.The protests appeared to be the most serious in recent months.   A band of protesters hurled about 20 firebombs into the U.S.Army's Camp Isabell in Seoul during the night but caused only minordamage, police and U.S. military officials said. The protestersfled before they could be caught.   Radical students claim the United States helps keep the Rohgovernment in power and are demanding withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.troops based in the nation. Students have staged a series ofattacks on U.S. facilities in recent months.   More than 1,000 students at Hankook University in Seoul staged afurious battle, pelting police with hundreds of firebombs androcks. Police in fatigues and visored helmets fired scores of teargas canisters and made several charges to force the protesters back.   Similar clashes occurred at at least 12 other Seoul collegesafter police blocked students from marching into the streets.   But a student call for evening protests in the center of Seoulwas mostly ignored with just a few protesters yelling slogans onsidewalks before being quickly swept away by thousands of riotpolice.   Student leaders urged students to imitate the example of the1960 revolt.   ``We must strike down the Roh dictatorship and establish truedemocracy in Korea,'' a leader at Hankook said as students cheered.   The government put riot police on top alert nationwide to blockprotests. At least 20,000 riot police were deployed in Seoul. Riotunits guarded key government buildings and some major intersections.   Police officials also said security was increased neargovernment buildings and embassies.   The radicals frequently stage violent demonstrations and attackgovernment offices. They lack popular support because of theirextreme views, and they are not seen as a serious threat to the Rohgovernment.   The radical students, who represent a small, but powerfulminority on college campuses, are trying to form an anti-governmentalliance with militant trade union groups campaigning for majorwage increases and other concessions.   About 1,000 striking electronic workers clashed today with riotpolice in the southeastern city of Changwon after a protest march.   A major crackdown was launched on labor strikes after Roh warnedlast week that strikes threatened to hamstring the economy. Rohsaid strikes had cost $2.4 billion in lost production and reducedexports by $600 million this year.   Roh, a former general, won presidential elections in December,1987 and has helped introduce broad democratic reforms, but manyKoreans still identify his government with his authoritarianpredecessor, Chun Doo-hwan.</TEXT></DOC>
