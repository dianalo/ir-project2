But the enemies ofcommunism have been grinding away at its foundations fornearly a century.   How much more impoverished would the Soviet people be, forexample, but for the four decades of honest broadcasts fromRadio Liberty, which has endured many an attack from theinternational left because of its U.S. ties. RL had tworeporters in the Russian parliament building through lastweek's coup, and it was through their facilities that BorisYeltsin was able to broadcast to the Russian people. MikhailGorbachev, held in captivity, tuned in. Elena Bonner, widowof the late dissident Andrei Sakharov, paid Radio Liberty ahigh compliment: &quot;Boys, during these days you were on thebarricades with us.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Amid our admiration for the Russian people who mannedthose barricades, it is fitting to pay tribute to the Westernanti-communists who over the long decades discreditedcommunism as an idea.   The historian Richard Pipes has exposed the myth that theRussian Revolution merely continued the long tradition ofRussian authoritarianism. Lenin's atheism and totalitarianismwere alien to Russian tradition. Communism was, instead, asecular religion that corrupted Western intellectuals, and itwas other Western intellectuals who debunked it.   While political pilgrims such as George Bernard Shawflooded into the Soviet Union and saw what they wanted tosee, others such as Rosa Luxembourg and Max Eastman lookedhonestly and came away shaken. Eastman returned home in 1924,and brought back the first evidence of a reign of terror.   Sidney Hook, the prototypical anticommunist, later wrote,&quot;The intensity of the animus generated by politicaldifferences among intellectuals during the last half-centurycan hardly be exaggerated.&quot;   One of the astonishing facts of the century was that itwas not until 1968, when Robert Conquest published &quot;The GreatTerror&quot; that one could speak authoritatively about the terrorwithout being contradicted by those who minimized or deniedit. In a later book, Mr. Conquest compared the terror andcollectivization of Ukraine agriculture to World War I,pointing out that the terror took about as long as the war,and involved an operation about as large. More were killed inUkraine than in all the battles of World War I.   The fury that greeted the Western critics of communism canscarcely be imagined in today's world, but during the 1930s,40s and 50s, conservative philosophers as well as liberals inthe classic tradition systematically dismantled Marxistlogic.   In the July, 1947 edition of Foreign Affairs, the earlyGeorge Kennan gave a voice to the containment policy that wasto prove so successful over the next decades, based on &quot;theadroit and vigilant application of counterforce at a seriesof constantly shifting geographical and political points.&quot;Many American strategists worked in anonymity to implementand sustain that counterforce for four decades.   In September of 1948, Whittaker Chambers said that topRoosevelt aide Alger Hiss had been a fellow communist agent.Rarely has a campaign of vilification been so virulent as theone launched against Chambers, who had dared besmirch Hiss,the upper-class Harvard Law grad and everybody's modelprogressive. But history has supported Chambers' claim, andhis account of his journey through communism, &quot;Witness&quot; isamong the most eloquent anti-Communist documents. &quot;You know,we are leaving the winning world for the losing world,&quot; hetold his wife when he quit the communist party forChristianity and democracy. He prayed he was wrong, and hewas.   The Hiss-Chambers confrontation crystallized theanti-communist movement. Among those who publiclyacknowledged the strength of Chambers' evidence was thecelebrated historian Arthur Schlesinger, an emblem of liberalanti-communism. Mr. Schlesinger was also an officer in theCongress for Cultural Freedom, along with Hook, JamesBurnham, Irving Kristol, Ignzio Silone and others. Theorganization once and for all destroyed communism as a forcein Western intellectual life, especially through its group ofmagazines, including the British magazine Encounter.   After destroying communism as an idea, these intellectualsshifted their emphasis in the 1960s to how to confrontcommunist expansionism. William F. Buckley wrote in a 1962column, for example, &quot;We view our atomic arsenal as proudlyand as devotedly as any pioneer ever viewed his flintlockhanging over the mantel as his children slept and dreamed.&quot;George Meany, leader of the AFL-CIO was a stalwart enemy oftotalitarianism, siding with free workers against whatprofessed to be a working class ideology.   George Orwell, who had devastated Soviet-style rhetoric in&quot;1984,&quot; once wrote, &quot;We have now sunk to a depth at which there-statement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligentmen.&quot; After the New Left inroads of the late 60s and thedetente of the 1970s, the West had reached a similar state ofhigh folly, in which Gerald Ford would not meet withAleksandr Solzhenitsyn for fear of upsetting the Soviets, andJimmy Carter warned of an &quot;inordinate fear of communism.&quot;   A family of intellectuals around The Committee for theFree World and Commentary magazine restated the coldwarrior's creed. The joke at their conferences was, &quot;Thatargument is so old I've forgotten the answer to it.&quot; FreedomHouse also kept the flame alive.   Western anti-communists did not face the gulag or thefiring squad, as did so many millions of their Sovietcounterparts. And it was Russians and Lithuanians who had thecourage to face the tanks last week. But in the long struggleagainst communism and Soviet power, there were Western heroesas well.</TEXT></DOC>
