But he warned it could take along time, and any U.S. military move would backfire.   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah made his comments in aninterview with the Moslem-run radio Voice of the Nation a day afterhe offered to help free Western hostages if Western countrieshelped release Arab prisoners in Israel.   Fadlallah is spiritual guide to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, orParty of God. The group is believed to be the umbrella organizationfor underground factions holding most of the Western hostages inLebanon.   Asked to comment on reports of a planned U.S. military action ifanother American hostage is killed, Fadlallah said:   ``This will not achieve anything but will endanger the hostagesfor whom the war is waged and will increase the possibilities ofwhat America calls terrorism.   ``We believe that any American military action will backfire andmay provoke revolutionary elements opposed to the American policyin the region,'' he said.   ``Therefore, the issue will move in the direction of a rationalsolution that may take a long time, but it will not move at all ina military atmosphere, at least in America's interests,'' he added.   The United States sent warships to the eastern Mediterranean andto waters near Iran during the height of the latest hostage crisis.   The crisis developed after Israel abducted aHezbollah-affiliated cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, from southLebanon on July 28. Israeli officials say Obeid has since confessedto helping plan attacks on Israel and to the 1988 abduction of U.S.Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, a U.N. peacekeeper in southLebanon.   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed it hangedHiggins on July 31 because Israel refused to free Obeid. However,some reports say he was killed months earlier.   Another group, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, said itwould kill American hostage Joseph Cicippio if Obeid was notreleased. However, it later said it had granted Cicippio areprieve, and offered to free him if Israel released Obeid and 450Arab prisoners and also let 55 Palestinian deportees return to theoccupied lands.   Israel has said any swap must include three Israeli soldiersheld in Lebanon.   In his remarks Saturday, Fadlallah also accused the UnitedStates of ``prolonging the detention'' of the hostages.   ``America could have resolved this problem realistically throughdeep, quiet diplomacy .... But instead it has worked on prolongingthe period of their detention because it found out it could use thehostage issue in its ... war against terrorism,'' Fadlallah said.   On Friday, Fadlallah said, ``Let us get to an agreement togetherso that each side would use his own means and influence to end thecrisis of the hostages _ all hostages _ and resolve the problem ofArab prisoners,'' he said.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and State Departmentspokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Fadlallah's statement was worthnoting.   Among the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon are eight Americans,four Britons, two West Germans, one Irishman and one Italian.Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent ofThe Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
