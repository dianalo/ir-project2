One aim of the bill was to improve procedures for Swiss judicial assistance in international insider cases, a point of friction with the U.S. in recent years.    Switzerland previously allowed the insider to go free but could punish those profiting from a tip.    The new legislation is expected to take effect next year. </TEXT></DOC>
