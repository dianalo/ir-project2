But a handful of moderate senators who say they are undecided about the nomination of Judge Bork to the Supreme Court told the nominee they were troubled by his views on free speech, privacy and civil rights for minorities and women.    The 60-year-old Judge Bork also insisted that he didn't act illegally in 1973 when he became acting attorney general and carried out President Nixon's order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.    The second day of what is likely to be two weeks of hearings was marked by a change in atmosphere. On Tuesday, Judge Bork's answers were often mired in constitutional philosophy and legal theory, bringing to mind his role as a Yale Law School professor before he became a federal appeals court judge in the District of Columbia in 1982.    Yesterday, Judge Bork tried to make his points in a punchier, less theoretical manner. An associate of Judge Bork's said he deliberately tried to make his answers less &quot;lawyer-to-lawyer. He read the papers, he saw how his answers were coming forward.&quot;    But the exchanges occasionally fell back on complex legal theory, as when Judge Bork sparred at length with Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) and Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), both considered important swing votes who list themselves as undecided.    Judge Bork was originally expected to complete his testimony yesterday, but the questioning has been so drawn out that he will have to reappear today and possibly even tomorrow. Following testimony from witnesses, the committee is expected to send the nomination to the full Senate, where the views of the undecided moderates on the 14-member committee are likely to be influential.    Yesterday, Judge Bork said he has abandoned his view, presented in a 1971 law review article, that the First Amendment protects only speech about political affairs. He said he believes the free-speech guarantee protects a broad range of speech, from literary and artistic work to advocacy of civil disobedience or violent action. He said he accepts Supreme Court precedent that advocating violent action or the overthrow of government is protected by the First Amendment, unless there is imminent danger that it will lead to such conduct. He said only obscenity and pornography aren't protected by the First Amendment.    But Sen. Specter said he was having difficulty figuring out Judge Bork's views on the First Amendment.    And Sen. DeConcini said the judge's responses to questions about the extent to which the Constitution prohibits sex discrimination left him &quot;unsatisfied.&quot;    Judge Bork said that although state laws distinguishing among different groups by race are &quot;utterly unreasonable,&quot; under the 14th Amendment guarantee of &quot;equal protection of the laws,&quot; it is &quot;sometimes reasonable&quot; for a legislature to differentiate between men and women.    But Sen. DeConcini questioned how Judge Bork, who says judges should stick to the original intent of the Constitution and amendments, can apply a test of reasonableness, or how he can treat sex bias differently from racial bias when the 14th Amendment protects all persons.    In the only drama of the day, Judge Bork forcefully retold the story of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre in 1973, when Attorney General Elliot Richardson resigned rather than fire Watergate prosecutor Cox. Judge Bork said he knew his &quot;moral and professional lives&quot; were at stake when he then fired Mr. Cox, but he said he assured the Watergate investigators that their probe would continue. Although Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), who raised the Watergate issue, said Judge Bork hasn't been forthright with the Congress in describing his role in the crisis, no other senators picked up on the issue.    In other statements, Judge Bork flatly denied one published report that he is an agnostic, and another report that he had once urged a return to prayer in the public schools.    Under questioning from Sen. Specter, Judge Bork made clear that he believes the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of &quot;due process&quot; applies narrowly, to procedural rights only, not to equality and other substantive rights. He said he disagreed with the Supreme Court's theory that the due-process guarantee required desegregation of District of Columbia public schools in 1954. But he said he wouldn't overrule the case and that &quot;segregation is immoral.&quot;    The ruling on the District schools was a companion case to the famous Brown vs. the Board of Education. The Brown decision said that the equal-protection guarantee in the 14th Amendment prohibits states from maintaining segregated school systems. But because the 14th Amendment applies to states, not to the federal government or the District of Columbia, the court applied a different rationale for the D.C. schools.    Sen. Specter said he is concerned about whether Judge Bork is &quot;going to make sharp variations&quot; from the Supreme Court's current approach to discrimination. </TEXT></DOC>
