MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Someday, somehow, Congress is going to have toraise its pay. But for now, political paralysis is keeping thesalary lid on for House and Senate members _ and for judges and topadministration officials, too.   When Congress gave up its 51 percent pay raise for fear of avoter rebellion, the action also froze salaries for 1,100 federaljudges, 834 appointed officials who manage Cabinet and similaragencies, 7,000 top civil servants, 12,000 foreign service employesand 155 generals and admirals.   The salary commission that recommended a $45,500 raise forCongress also proposed increases for judges, Cabinet officers andother appointed positions. They were part of the package that wouldhave become effective automatically Feb. 8 if it had not been vetoedby both houses of Congress.   It was.   The other salaries are pegged to those at the top.   As Robert F. Kennedy once said, ``I'm sorry to have taken so manynice fellows over the side with me.'' Kennedy, then attorneygeneral, was joking about President Lyndon B. Johnson's announcementthat no member of his Cabinet would be on the 1964 Democratic ticketas vice presidential nominee.   With its rejection of this year's pay raise, Congress may haveeffectively scuttled the system under which salaries were proposed,by an appointed panel insulated against voter punishment forunpopular increases. The recommendations went to presidents whocould reject or revise them. Then they were to take effect in 30days unless the House and Senate both said no.   Congress linked judicial and executive branch salaries to its ownas part of the same system of political insulation.   President Bush had supported the raise, and when Congress turnedit down he said judicial salaries should be increased separately ifnot as part of the pay package. He said he would make a payrecommendation to Congress later in the year.   ``I believe that some level of pay increase is in order and Iwill be working with the House and Senate leadership to achieve thatend,'' Bush said.   But first, a cooling off period. Speaker Jim Wright of Texas,battered by both sides on the pay issue, said the House won't belooking at new pay plans any time soon.   Judicial salaries are a particular problem, given the high priceof lawyers these days. Federal district judges get the same $89,500a member of Congress gets, and increasing numbers have beenresigning their lifetime appointments in favor of private practice.   While judicial salaries have been increased six times during thelast decade, the raises represent just over half the increase in thecost of living. Judges complain that their real buying power hasdeclined by one-third in the past 20 years.   But Congress likes the package approach that ties their salaryincreases to those of judges and other officials, on thesafety-in-numbers theory that didn't work this time.   That leaves Congress, and the entire government, back at squareone on the salary problem. The Constitution says congressionalcompensation is ``to be ascertained by law,'' which means byCongress. And Congress still shrinks from the risk of voting toascertain that it merits a raise. Former Sen. Howard Baker Jr. saysCongress may be institutionally incapable of setting its own salary.``It is the grand daddy conflict of interest of all time,'' he toldthe salary commission.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois has proposed what he says wouldbe a way out. He calls it ``the sign-in system,'' and says it isbased on the notion that congressmen should be honest about theirsalaries.   He's introduced a bill under which members would determine theirown salaries, within a range between the current salary and the$135,000 a year the commission recommended. Each member would pick anumber, announce it and be judged on it by constituents in the nextelection.   It is an idea whose time is not likely to come, given the factthat choosing a raise individually would be even riskier than votingfor one on the floor.   Rostenkowski, a 30-year man who chairs the Ways and MeansCommittee, said he'd sign up for the maximum because he's worth it.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
