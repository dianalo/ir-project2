The minutes confirm that the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee decided 10-1 to ease its grip on credit slightly when it met July 5 and 6. The Fed eased a second time later in July.    The committee met again last week, but there are no indications it decided to alter monetary policy. Minutes of that session won't be released until October.    The July minutes say that &quot;nearly all&quot; committee members favored an easier policy, reflecting concern about the slowing economy and slower-than-desired growth in the money supply. But some feared that anything beyond &quot;a slight move . . . could have an undesirable effect on inflationary expectations and . . . could lead eventually to upward pressure on interest rates.&quot;    Only Reserve Board member Martha Seger dissented from the final vote; she wanted a greater reduction in interest rates. Another committee member, who isn't identified in the minutes, wanted a series of easing moves over several weeks. And some members, worried about the risks of recession, wanted the committee at least to agree to lean toward additional easing later in the summer.    The final decision was to issue instructions to the staff making a subsequent easing or tightening equally likely, depending on economic conditions. &quot;This caution was dictated by current uncertainties regarding the economic outlook, the still rapid rate of inflation and the relatively sensitive conditions in financial markets,&quot; the minutes say.    The Fed did, however, ease again during the last week in July, the third such move this year. Since the spring, the federal funds interest rate -- controlled by the Fed -- has been reduced by 3/4 of a percentage point to about 9%. The rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans. The latest minutes offer an example of the Fed's reluctance to disclose details of its deliberations even months after decisions have been made. The minutes disguise the tensions that preceded a decision to lower interest rates in June, the first such reduction in more than a year. That decision, the most significant that Fed policy makers have made so far this year, came only after a series of telephone conferences in late May and early June.    The minutes say simply: &quot;A variety of developments began to suggest that a slackening in inflation pressures might be in prospect as indications of slower economic expansion continued to accumulate, monetary growth remained sluggish, and the dollar climbed further.&quot;    &quot;In these circumstances,&quot; the minutes say without any reference to the conference calls, the Fed staff member charged with carrying out committee decisions injected additional credit into the economy. The wording apparently reflects a tactical decision by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan not to take a formal vote at the June 3 meeting.    The minutes disclose that Silas Keehn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, objected to the committee's decision, disclosed last month, to set tentative ranges for growth in the money supply for 1990 at the same level as in 1989. In the recent past, the Fed has lowered those ranges each year. Mr. Keehn sought to continue that practice to underscore the Fed's commitment to price stability.    The open market committee consists of the six current Reserve Board members and five of the 12 presidents of the regional reserve banks. There is one vacancy on the board, and Bush administration officials say they aren't close to filling it. </TEXT></DOC>
