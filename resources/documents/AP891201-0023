U.S. warplanes joined the battle to save the government as theattack began before dawn. By sundown the Philippine government haddeclared the coup a failure.   Late tonight, mutineers left the government television stationand Villamor Air Base _ the air force headquarters _ which they hadseized in the early hours of the assault.   Hundreds of mutinous marines also marched out of Fort Bonifacio,their home garrison, and members of all three groups marchedtogether down a major thoroughfare toward Camp Aguinaldo,headquarters of the armed forces general staff.   It was unclear what they intended to do when they got there, butpro-government troops did not try to stop them. Occasionally,rebels fired weapons in the air and pointed rifles at journaliststrying to follow them.   Earlier, Manila radio stations broadcast a statement from Mrs.Aquino in which she said the ``enemy is routed but is not yetvanquished.'' She was not seen on national television.   At sundown, the military chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa,declared that the sixth coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino wascrushed and that loyal troops had recaptured armed forcesheadquarters at Camp Aquinaldo and the Sangley Point naval base.   At least 22 people were killed and 87 wounded during the coupattempt, most of them civilians, officials in the Phillipines said.Estimates of the number of rebels ranged from 800 to 2,000.   As their vintage planes fired on targets, crowds of civilianonlookers cheered.   ``Wow! That was a great shot,'' said cigarette vendor JulioTorres, pointing toward the presidential palace. ``But it wouldreally be better if there could be a dog fight later on, just likein the movies.''   U.S. F-4 fighter jets flying ``combat air patrol'' roared overthe capital from Clark Air Base, 50 miles from the capital, said aU.S. Defense Department spokesman, Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Oborn.He did not report any firing by the American planes.   Rebel soldiers would not say who led the fighting. When it beganjust after midnight Thursday, de Villa said it was believed themutineers were followers of Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan,who led an August 1987 coup attempt in which at least 53 peopledied.   Honasan has been at large since his escape from prison in April1988. Honasan supported Mrs. Aquino when she came to power fouryears ago in an uprising that ousted Ferdinand Marcos. He thenturned against her, accusing her of failing to deal effectivelywith Communist insurgents and not fighting corruption or improvingthe economy.   Early today, two T-28 aircraft bombed and rocketed thepresidential Malacanang Palace compound. Witnesses said twopresidential guards and three other people were killed.   ``They're bombing us!'' a palace staff member cried over thetelephone. ``We're going down!''   When mutineers at the rebel-held government TV station saw theattack, they cheered and shouted, ``Cory is dead!''   But Philippines Ambassador Emmanuel Pelaez, interviewed inWashington today on NBC's ``Today'' show, said the palace was nothit.   Mrs. Aquino was reported safe. Her latest comments were made ata Cabinet dinner about 12 hours after the attack at MalacanangPalace, according to private radio stations that broadcast them.   A Bush administration official said U.S. planes began flyingover the Sangley Point and Villamor bases shortly after thepresidential authorization came at 12:32 a.m. EST today.   David Andresen, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Manila, saidat 8:10 a.m. EST that he had not heard any planes flying overheadfor an hour.   The Bush administration official said U.S. ground troops werenot involved.   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theAmerican planes were intended to prevent rebel planes from takingoff. This allowed the Philippine government to consolidate itsforces.   A spokesman for the rebels, speaking on condition he not benamed, said his forces had declared themselves a provisionalrevolutionary government. He said the U.S. move was an affront toFilipino sovereignty.   The U.S. military has 40,000 troops, military dependents andDefense Department civilians stationed at six bases in thePhilippines. The U.S. military presence here is strongly opposed inthe Philippines Senate.   Mrs. Aquino has not said where she stands on renewal of thelease for the bases, which runs out in 1991.   The rebels appeared to be mainly from the army and marines.   As the assault began, they were transporting large amounts ofammunition to Villamor from nearby Fort Bonifacio. In addition toVillamor, they seized parts of Manila's main airport and bombedgovernment installations through the day.   Local reporters said rebels also seized the airport nearLegazpi, 220 miles southeast of Manila. Retired Brig. Gen. JesusHermosa, a security adviser in Cebu province, said a boatload ofmutineers landed near Cebu City's Mactan International Airport, 350miles southeast of Manila. Mactan is the country's second majorairport.   A rebel bomb knocked out the government's RPN television andrebel forces held a private television station. Witnesses reportedtwo pro-government soldiers and three civilians were killed duringclashes near RPN.   Rebel helicopters and propeller-driven planes repeatedly bombedthe Philippine Constabulary headquarters at Manila's Camp Crame,setting the main building ablaze.   Other bombs landed across the street at Camp Aguinaldo, thearmed forces headquarters. One heavily damaged de Villa's home.Thousands of civilians fled neighborhoods around the suburbanmilitary garrisons.   De Villa estimated rebel strength at 800. A mutinous captain putthe figure at 2,000. De Villa claimed troops remained loyal innorthern Luzon, Mindanao and in the southern Luzon command.   But Gov. Rudolfo Aguinaldo of Cagayan province said in a radiointerview later that soldiers in his northern Luzon area supportedthe mutiny.   Unlike the August 1987 coup attempt, when civilians poured intothe streets to back Mrs. Aquino and cheer government forces, thistime they watched in silence as planes pounded the garrison.   Besides dissatisfaction within the military, public discontentwith the Aquino government has been growing because of risingprices, a shortage of electricity and allegations of corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
