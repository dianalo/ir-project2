On a 16-7 vote, the Senate Budget Committee approved a $1.16trillion blueprint for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, adocument implementing the deficit-reduction pact reached last weekbetween the Bush administration and congressional leaders. NineDemocrats and seven Republicans supported the proposal.   The plan touts enough cuts to bring next year's deficit to $99.4billion, less than the Gramm-Rudman law's $100 billion ceiling.Critics say the savings are insufficient and illusory, relying onoverly rosey predictions of economic performance and one-timesavings like sales of federal assets.   Many leading budget writers defend the agreement, saying it willprepare them for the far more difficult task of coming up with a1991 budget when the law requires a shortfall of no greater than$64 billion.   But before that will come the struggle by congressional taxcommittees to find $5.3 billion in new taxes. Bush has championed areduction in the capital gains tax that he says will raise revenueby stimulating the economy. Democrats have opposed the idea,calling it a money-loser that benefits mainly the wealthy.   Another $5.7 billion will have to come from sales of assets.   The chairman of the Senate budget panel, Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,noted that the 1990 spending plan sets the precedent of putting``everything'' _ domestic and defense programs, and revenue sources_ on the table in future budget talks.   The budget committee's ranking Republican, Pete Domenici,R-N.M., also defended the 1990 spending plan by saying it paves theway for work on savings in 1991. ``It is not the best budget, butit is an acceptable, workable budget and is better than anyalternative,'' he said.   The 1990 spending blueprint would allow $299.2 billion inspending for defense programs next year, a $4.8 billion cut in theamount Bush proposed in the budget he presented Congress inFebruary.   But none of the 20 other spending categories into which thebudget is divided were treated as harshly, and several came out aswinners.   Spending for science and space programs would reach $14 billion,a $400 million increase above the rate of inflation. Education andemployment programs would grow $300 million to $38.7 billion. Andlaw enforcement, driven largely by Congress' desire to financeanti-drug efforts, would reach $10.2 billion, a $200 millionincrease.   Big savings would come from Medicare, the health program for theelderly and handicapped, which would be trimmed by $2.6 billion to$122.4 billion. Lawmakers expect the savings to come fromreductions in payments to doctors and hospitals.   Agriculture spending would drop $2 billion to $15 billion,environmental programs would be cut $700 million to $17.4 billion,and veterans' programs would lose $700 million for a total of $29.8billion.   Housing and commerce programs would be slashed $2.2 billion to$18.1 billion, but $1.8 billion of the drop would be a result of apaper shift of the Postal Service to an ``off-budget'' account.   As provided in the budget agreement announced last Friday, therewould be $19 billion in new spending for international affairs.   By a 12-7 vote, the panel rejected an amendment by Sen. KentConrad, D-N.D., that would have sent the congressional andadministration negotiators back to the table to seek deepersavings. And on a 12-10 vote, they defeated a move by Sen. ErnestHollings, D-S.C., that would have imposed $46 billion in deficitreductions.   The full Senate is expected to consider the budget resolutionwhen it returns in early May from its April recess. The HouseBudget Committee plans to write its own version of the budget nextweek.   After congressional passage of a budget resolution, more than adozen laws will be needed to implement the spending and taxingdecisions it makes.</TEXT></DOC>
