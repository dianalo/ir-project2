James R. Radzimski, a former National Security Council aide,told prosecutors that the memo by former NSC aide Oliver L. Northreferred to $12 million in arms-sale proceeds that went to theContras, according to a filing in U.S. District Court.   North's memo to former national security adviser John M.Poindexter was attached to a letter that Poindexter sent to Reagan,according to an account of Radzimski's statements to prosecutors.   Reagan has denied knowing about the diversion and independentcounsel Lawrence E. Walsh has said he found no evidence thepresident knew anything about it.   Radzimski's statements were recounted in a letter Walsh sent toNorth's defense lawyers and filed Monday in court. The former WhiteHouse aide has also told Congress he didn't know if Reagan ever sawthe memos.   During last summer's congressional probe of the Iran-Contraaffair, Radzimski's name was dropped from a list of publicwitnesses who were to appear at the hearings after investigatorsdecided that his memory of the affair was faulty.   He ended up testifying to the House-Senate committee behindclosed doors.   North, Poindexter and two arms dealers, retired Air Force Maj.Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, are accused of illegallyconspiring to divert arms-sale profits to the rebels.   Radzimski's recollections about the memo were offered to thedefense as evidence that might help exonerate North of wrongdoing.Walsh's July 28 letter also includes statements by other witnessesthat North told them that lawyers advised him his activities werelegal.   North, whose trial was recently postponed until after thepresidential election, could opt to offer these statements asevidence that he had no intention of violating the law since heacted under the assumption his activities were considered legal.   Radzimski described North's memo as similar to one found bythen-Attorney General Edwin Meese III in November 1986 thatrevealed the diversion of arms-sale proceeds, according to Walsh'sletter.   Meese's investigation led to the dismissal of North andPoindexter's resignation.   North told Congress last year that he intended for Reagan to seehis memo about the diversion, but Poindexter testified he nevergave it to the president.   The memo Radzimski ``recalls seeing was two to three pages longand was written by Oliver North and addressed to John Poindexter.Attached to the memo was a letter from Poindexter to thepresident,'' Walsh wrote in the July 28 letter to North's lawyers.   Radzimski told the House and Senate committees that investigatedthe Iran-Contra affair that he recalled seeing ``two memorandums,one addressed to Poindexter from Oliver North and a secondmemorandum from Poindexter to the president.''   But he told the panel he couldn't recall whether the memorandumwas delivered to Reagan.</TEXT></DOC>
