(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The DilemmaandM;One primary difference between LANs is their degree of &quot;localness.&quot;andP;  The PCLANs so prevealent today are generally limited to covering single departmentsor a single building, and support a set of similar applications.andP;  LargerLANs, encompassing many buildings, incorporating miles of cabling, andsupporting a wide array of diverse network users are frequently referred toas &quot;enterprise networks&quot; to distinguish them from departmental LANs.andP;  Theearliest and largest such networks were based on broadband coaxial cable(CATV) technology, and most are still in operation today.andM;These early LANs had as an objective the integration of video informationwithin the scope of the network.andP;  This was part of the rationale for usingbroadband coaxial cable, which carried a wide span of frequencies and couldsupport many services.andM;Today, enterprise networks may be characterized by their wide geographicrange, large number of users (hundreds to thousands), and multiplicity ofservices.andP;  While these characteristics are unique from LAN to LAN, onecentral factor which underlies all true enterprise networks today is that ofbeing mission-critical, or essential to the day-to-day operations of theenterprise.andM;Mission-Critical LANsandM;Mission-critical networks are a relatively new phenomenon.andP;  In the early1980s it wasn't easy to convince managers that they needed a local areanetwork for their organization, as the personal computers proliferating amongprofessionals weren't yet considered serious business tools.andP;  At one pointmanagement awoke to discover that corporate information assets were stored inthose computers.andP;  Hence the birth of the departmental LAN, linking desktopsand boosting productivity.andP;  Today, LANs may be called upon to connect diversetypes of personal computers, host computers, and workstations.andP;  They mayrequire access to long-haul facilities, or support fax distribution orhigh-speed imaging.andM;Requirements like these are becoming commonplace across many industries.andO;Hospitals, research and development facilities, factories, universities,commercial offices, and the process industries are all part of the growingmarket for LAN services and connectivity.andP;  In these organizations, the choiceof a network medium has far-reaching implications for network managers andusers alike.andM;Why Broadband?andM;In the late 1970s and early 1980s, if a company was serious aboutimplementing a large, multiservice network, broadband was about the only wayto go.andP;  Factories were among the earliest users of such networks, and thefactory is still largely broadband-based.andP;  This is due in part to the GeneralMotors-initiated Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) activity, whichfocused primarily on broadband, but also because the medium fits the demandsof the factory so well.andM;In a mamufacturing facility, for example, there is often no physicalpartitioning of the buildings--no permanent wiring centers--and every fewyears major sections of each building may be totally rebuilt.andP;  Braodbandcable can be run through the trusses of the plant in a branching treetopology, very economically providing several access points within every 200to 300 square feet.andM;Broadband LANs allow network users to walk up to a single wall outlet andconnect a variety of devices to the network: a television, a 10Mbps Ethernetmodem, a 19.2Kbps modem, a PC adapter, or an audio communication device.andO;Broadband features massive geographic coverage; flexible, extensible cabling;multiple service support; noise immunity; and rugged, reliable components.andM;For example, a prominent research and development center operates over onethousand asynchronous terminals using a 1Mbps carrier modem.andP;  Severalchannels of 50Kbps modems are used for data-acquisition lab equipment.andP;  One10Mbps Ethernet channel has been implemented, as have thirteen channels ofTV, including an educational channel carrying degree-granting programs.andP;  Over50 people are enrolled in video education at the center, saving thousands ofdollars in tuition and travel expenses.andM;Hospitals have also joined the LAN revolution as they strive to serve manydiverse communities of interest while supporting complex video and imagingneeds.andP;  One of the largest hospitals in the U.S.andP;  employs an extensivenetwork featuring two independent 10Mbps Ethernet channels: one for userapplications and DEC LAT terminal servers, and a separate channel forhigh-speed imaging.andM;Similarly, a major university's network operates over three thousand ASCIIterminals connected with two different broadband terminal server approaches,plus Ethernet and a substantial amount of TV.andM;Although each of these sites has decided to install a fiber-optic backbone,developments typically span several years for very large LANs, and thebroadband system will certainly be used for many years to come.andM;Reputations for ComplexityandM;Despite broadband's usefulness and power, there are factors which are causingit to be less commonly selected as the medium of choice for new networkimplementations.andP;  It is a complex medium.andP;  The amplification and equalizationrequired are manageable, but do require maintenance.andP;  Broadband shares acharacteristic with all bus topologies: an outage or noise source in one areaof the cable can affect the entire network.andP;  While the reliability of thebroadband network itself is high, one or more services can be disrupted by aproblem affecting a certain range in the frequency spectrum.andM;Keeping all services operational at a 99.9 percent availability level can bedifficult; indeed, protecting the network from a widespread outage caused bya noise source at some extremity of the network can be problematic as well.andO;Further chronic complications can develop if the broadband network has notbeen weel-designed and, regrettably, a number of such problem networks havebeen deployed.andM;These less successful network implementations have given the broadbandapproach a negative image which is not justified; many broadband networks runfor two or three years without a single overall outage.andM;Another impediment to the proliferation of broadband networks has been theprice per connection to the cable.andP;  Especially for 10Mbps services, theattachment costs are in the thousands of dollars.andP;  While many fineapplications at lower bandwidths run well and cost-effectively, userexpectations are now focused on 10Mbps as the desired channel speed, and thecost for such services on broadband has not come down significantly in recentyears.andP;  This is not to say that broadband's usefulness should be discounted,however, it remains a very suitable large-LAN backbone, and a multitude oflarge LANs in both factory and commercial/educational campus environments areoperating successfully.andM;As a LAN medium, broadband can be summarized in this way: it provides anextremely high number of access points to multiple services over a broad areaat a relatively low price.andP;  Utilizing these access points for high-speed10Mbps services is expensive if each connected device needs a 10Mbps modem.andO;However, where the 10Mbps modem may be shared by multiple devices, or wherethe devices are scattered across a large area, 10Mbps braodband can still bemore cost-effective than fiber.andM;Broadband remains the most economical technique for broadcast-type TVdistribution (one source to many destinations); for point-to-point closedcircuit television applications, the trade-off with fiber becomes less clear.andO;To make the most of a broadband system, then, users should capitalize on itsvideo strengths, and implement 10Mbps data services on the broadband wheredoing so is less expensive than running new cabling.andM;Why Choose Fiber?andM;The use of fiber optics for LANs has taken hold in a major way in the pasttwo years, for two primary reasons: for many sites, metallic communicationcabling between buildings is prohibited because of lightning and electricalgrounding concerns.andP;  Additionally, users envision implementing the 100MbpsFiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) in the future, so laying a structuredfiber-optic cabling system is a sound long-term investment.andM;The standards for installing a multipurpose system of fiber cables havebecome more entrenched, utilizing multimode 62.5/125 micron cables which aresuitable for many services, including Ethernet, FDDI, and video.andP;  Mostimportant, it seems, is historic precedent: others have tried it, and itworks.andP;  The &quot;comfort factor&quot; is there now for fiber, where it took apioneering spirit several years ago to undertake a fiber installation.andM;This comfort factor stems largely from what is probably the most successfulservice operating on fiber cessful service operating on fiber LANs today:fiber-optic Ethernet.andP;  Without a cost-effective, near-term solution for usingthe fibers for data, many sites would have deferred installing fiber untilFDDI was truly at hand.andP;  However, fiber has been approved for Ethernet sincethe adoption of the Fiber Optic Inter-Repeater Link (FOIRL) standard severalyears ago, and is being used extensively for this purpose.andP;  Also, the 10BaseFstandards activity is clarifying the techniques for widespread distributionof fiber-optic Ethernet/802.3 signalling over a large area.andM;Fiber is increasingly being considered for Token Ring backbones, especiallyfor inter-building connections.andP;  While difficult to quantify statistically,Token Ring sites overall seem less inclined to implement fiber than do thosewith strong current requirements for Ethernet and long-term needs for FDDI.andM;Fiber To The DeskandM;In all cases, an unresolved issue is that of extending fiber to the enddevice, commonly referred to as &quot;fiber to the desk.&quot;andP;  Few sites have extendedfiber to end users, although some forward-looking organizations have plannedto do so.andP;  One reason for the slowness in the fiber-to-the-desk movement isthe success of running high bit rates from wiring closets to the end deviceson shielded and unshielded twisted-pair cables.andP;  Although in some factorynetworks the use of fiber to the end device is slowly catching on, for themost part fiber LANs typically concern the interconnection of wiring centers,and do not necessarily include running fiber all the way to the end devices.andM;The Final DecisionandM;In deciding between broadband and fiber, much depends on an organization'sstarting point and future plans.andP;  Obviously, an organization with a largebroadband system will continue to utilize it.andP;  10Mbps services such as IEEE802.3 (10Broad36) Ethernet and 802.4 (Token Bus or MAP) are now available.andO;Many sites will have both services, because even where there is a large MAPdemand, there are often engineering applications or workstations mosteconomically addressed with Ethernet service.andM;For one of its primary markets, that of the factory, broadband is stillwidely employed and appears to be a solid approach.andP;  However, for a new siteor a major overhaul of an existing system, the network planner should lookclosely at fiber.andP;  One interesting result of Ethernet's success is thatalmost all factory communication above the level of direct machine controlcan be accommodated by this single link-layer protocol.andM;To a degree, this decreases the need for multiprotocol support, anddiminishes the value of broadband's capability to handle such diversity.andO;While optimized techniques for device connection on broadband are veryeffective where broadband is in place, a new facility may avoid thatrequirement by reducing the number of supported protocols.andP;  For example,there are very cost-effective broadband products for specific deviceconnection (point-to-point modems, Allen-Bradley LAN/1, the IBM PC Networkand Hughes LAN Systems' equivalent for PC connectivity).andM;However, an all-Ethernet strategy may accommodate these end devices in a moreconsistent and higher-speed manner.andP;  For sites anticipating the use of MAPservices and applications, many users feel that such high-level services willbe available on a variety of lower-level protocols.andP;  It is becoming clearthat MAP application services, such as the Manufacturing Message Standard(MMS), can and will be implemented over Ethernet/802.3 networks, as well asover 802.4 Token Bus.andP;  Utilizing an all-fiber network is not at allincompatible with MAP applications.andM;The Culture FactorandM;In looking at sites where fiber is being used as the local area networkmedium, one can make some interesting observations.andP;  Vertical markets, suchas petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and mining, are using fiber more readilythan others within the industrial sector.andP;  Hospitals are using fiber morereadily than commercial buildings.andP;  There are &quot;intrinsic&quot; factors which makefiber a natural choice, such as in volatile environments where metalliccircuits could cause a spark.andP;  However, it seems that in fact the decision touse fiber is more often an issue of corporate culture than it is a technicalor cost issue.andP;  This is analogous to the early use of personal computers.andO;Did most applications require personal computers?andP;  No, but somewhere alongthe line people started using them, and going back to terminals has neverbeen been seriously considered.andM;A similar condition exists with fiber; if someone says, &quot;it's going to befiber,&quot; the decision typically sticks, with little second-guessing.andM;The message for the network planner is clear: get to know your mediaalternatives well before making a decision.andP;  Before ruling out broadband asan element of strategy, assure that video requirements are either handled orare outside your scope of objectives.andP;  Accordingly, before ruling out fiber,be certain that the distribution of 10Mbps and higher-rate services can beprovided economically where needed.andP;  Above all, be open to what is happeningin the overall LAN arena for facilities like your own.andM;Some Broadband ManufacturersandM;3Com 3165 Kifer Rd.
