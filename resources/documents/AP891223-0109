But the hostages, CBS producer Jon Meyersohn and Doug Mullen, anAmerican businessman, said they had not been mistreated duringtheir captivity.   The two were taken captive Wednesday at the Marriott Hotel inPanama City as the U.S. assault on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega'sforces reached its height.   Meyersohn told a news conference in Panama City that he andMullen were taken to several locations during their captivity,first to a jungle clearing, then to a farmhouse, then to anapartment in the city.   He said their hands had been tied, they were at one point boundto trees, and they feared for their lives.   They gave ``no inclination they weren't going to kill us,''Meyersohn said.   He said they were held in the jungle by five captors _ three menand two women _ armed with knives, pistols, grenades, and automaticweapons. The captors were either current or former members of thePanamanian Defense Forces, he said.   Meyersohn said Mullen persuaded the captors to let them make atelephone call Friday, allowing them to contact their families andemployers. They were released Saturday at a neutral location.   A statement by the U.S. Embassy said the embassy ``workeddiligently to secure their release.''   Meyersohn said the captors were very disorganized and undecidedabout what to do with their hostages.   ``Once they realized they couldn't bargain for us, they held usfor their security,'' Meyersohn said. ``They just didn't know whatto do.''   Mullen called the captivity ``a roller-coaster ride.''   ``I was very conscious of the fact that in Panama at this time,there were a lot of desperate people, and desperate people dodesperate things.''</TEXT></DOC>
