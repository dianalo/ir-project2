The 200 advertising cards are on subway cars of theMassachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Together, Boston-areachapters of the Mobilization for Survival, the American FriendsService Committee and the Lebanon Emergency Committee paid $2,300for the month-long ad campaign, which began last week.   The sponsors say their message is only an attack on U.S. policyin Israel and an endorsement of self-determination forPalestinians. But rabbis and other leaders among greater Boston's180,000 Jews say the ads are racist.   The advertisements include a photograph of seven Israelisoldiers, guns raised, subduing a Palestinian youth. Unrest on theWest Bank and Gaza Strip has continued since late last year.   The accompanying text reads: ``Your tax dollars pay for theviolence in the Israeli Occupied Territories. Since December,thousands of Palestinians have been shot, beaten and tear-gassed bythe Israeli military. Every year the U.S. sends more than $4billion in military and economic aid to Israel. Isn't it time tospeak out? No aid for the occupation.''   Rabbi Richard Yellin of Congregation Mishkan Tefila in Newtoncalled the ads ``blatantly anti-Zionist, blatantly anti-America.''   Yellin said he tried to get the transit authority to remove theads. But he gave up in the face of arguments that the FirstAmendment right of free expression protects the ads and the peoplewho put them up.   Vincent Carbona, spokesman for the transit authority, said theadvertisements were installed after legal advisers approved them.   Yellin said the only recourse is to take out new ads in acounter-attack, but he discarded that idea as likely to inflame theissue out of proportion. ``It's not worth it. It's a low-brow, abumper-sticker mentality.''   Philip Perlmutter, executive director of the Jewish CommunityRelations Council of Greater Boston, called the ad campaign ``to mea brazen example of propaganda and hypocrisy. These people havenever spoken up about the violence of Arabs against Arabs.''   Melani McAlister, Middle East staffer at Mobilization forSurvival in Cambridge, denied charges the ads attack Jews.   ``We really believe we're standing with Israelis and with Jewsand Palestinians who support peace and a negotiated peace,'' Ms.McAlister said.   ``People would have to distort what's there to see it asanti-Semitic,'' she said, adding that the organization also worksto combat anti-Semitism and racism. ``People have to learn toseparate Israeli government policy and Jews.''   Joseph Gerson, a Jew and a spokesman for the American FriendsService Committee, called the charges of anti-Semitism ridiculous.   ``People have to be able to criticize the policies of agovernment state, and what the poster does is call attention to theoccupation,'' Gerson said.   The American Friends Service Committee is run by Quakers topromote various ideals such as peace and social justice, saidanother spokesman, Robert Dove. Membership is open to non-Quakersas well as Quakers.</TEXT></DOC>
