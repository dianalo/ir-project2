Note:</T4> When considering these reports and the conclusions therefrom,the variety of topics covered should be borne in mind: (a) Actual, known exposures to Agent Orange. They are limited to the AirForce Ranch Hand health studies and may or may not be completely relevantto ground troops in Vietnam. (b) Known or presumed exposure to phenoxy herbicides in a variety of circumstances,chiefly in agriculture or forestry, but under conditions different fromthose in Vietnam. They are related to conditions in Vietnam only insofaras the exposures correspond to those encountered by troops in that country.(c) Exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD usually during the manufacture of variouschemicals. Their relevance to field conditions in Vietnam rests on theassumption that troops there had a significant exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDDthrough contact with Agent Orange. (d) The ``Vietnam experience'' related to possible adverse health effectsof service in that country during the conflict there. The results and conclusionsof such research do not necessarily implicate any specific cause for adversehealth effects and do not contribute directly to understanding a possiblerole of Agent Orange. They are relevant, however, to the VA's decisionsas to a possible service connection of health defects.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 3, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas K.

The first ``phase'' used proportionatemortality ratios (PMRs) to compare veterans with Wisconsin non-veterans.One or more veterans' groups had an elevated PMR for 24 causes of deathand, as is inherent in PMR calculations, an offsetting reduced PMR for13 causes. The results were consistent with a conclusion that there weresignificant differences between veterans and non-veterans as to the causesof death with evidence of the ``healthy veteran'' effect and of effectsfrom tobacco and alcohol use by veterans. Violent deaths from externalcauses and psychiatric disturbances were also relatively more common amongveterans. A second phase compared separately and combined the causes ofdeath for 923 white male veterans with non-veterans. Again the PMRs demonstratedthe ``healthy veteran'' effect and an excess of deaths from external violentcauses. Soft tissue sarcomas showed no significantly elevated PMR for Vietnamveterans as compared to non-Vietnam veterans or to non-veterans. Both Vietnamand non-Vietnam veterans, however, had an elevated PMR for soft tissuesarcomas when compared to all other veterans; the number of deaths wassmall and limited the significance of the results. In the third ``phase,''discharge documents (DD214) identified 43,398 Vietnam veterans and 78,840veterans who contemporaneously served elsewhere. It was possible to analyze927 deaths of Vietnam veterans and 1,663 deaths in the comparison group.These were compared to the deaths for the entire Nation, all of the state,Wisconsin civilians, and all Wisconsin veterans using standardized mortalityratios (SMRs). Again, the ``healthy veteran'' effect was evident; cancerof ``other lymphatic tissue'' had an elevated SMR for male Vietnam veteranscompared to all veterans; external causes had an elevated SMR for the Vietnamveterans as compared to their non-Vietnam contemporaries. Vietnam veteranshad a higher SMR for suicide when compared to the Nation, Wisconsin civilians,all veterans, and non-Vietnam veterans. <T3>Comment:</T3> The study was well planned and conducted but, in somerespects, suffers from the relatively small number of deaths and the useof the DD214 to determine Vietnam service for which purpose it is not completelyinformative. It also assumes that service in Vietnam is the equivalentof exposure to Agent Orange and its dioxin contaminant which is, at best,a questionable assumption for research purpose. On balance the resultsdo not support any health deficit associated with Agent Orange or servicein Vietnam. (b) Anon. <T3>Health survey of Massachusetts Vietnam veterans.</T3> Questionnaireswere sent to 2,000 Massachusetts veterans who had filed claims for damagesdue to Agent Orange in a class-action suit; 1,500 responded. Some 300 additionalquestionnaires were sent to veterans who requested them. From the 1,800returned, 1,500 questionnaires ``were selected based on the criteria ofcompletedness (sic) and actual service in Vietnam''. Assistance in completingthe questionnaires was provided by program staff and ``trained volunteers.''More than a quarter of the responses reported diagnoses of malignant orbenign tumors; 9 had Hodgkins's disease diagnosed. At least one birth defectwas reported in 462 of 1,907 live births and 160 children had more thanone defect. A large proportion of respondents reported such disturbancesas decreased libido, fertility disorders, tiredness, headaches, memoryloss or concentration difficulties and ``nervous disorders.'' Over two-thirdsclaimed symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. The investigators concludedthat the results ``clearly indicate considerable disease and sufferingamong a relatively young group of people.'' <T3>Comment:</T3> No meaningful conclusions can be drawn from this reporton a self-selected group whose membership was modified using unspecifiedcriteria for eliminating responses to a series of leading questions; aseries of steps that led to a wide variety of multiple complaints. No controlgroup was even attempted. (c) Hoar et al.<T3> Agricultural herbicide use and risk of lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma.</T3>A cancer registry search allowed data collection and interviews to be madefor 133 histologically proved cases of soft-tissue sarcoma, 121 of Hodgkin'sdisease, and 170 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Kansas. Random dialing collected948 matched controls. Either patients or their next-of-kin and the controlswere interviewed by telephone to elicit occupational details of exposureto herbicides and pesticides. Results were checked with chemical suppliersin 110 cases. No correlation of pesticide use and death was found overallfor soft-tissue sarcomas or either type of lymphoma. Farmers exposed to2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) for 20 days a year has a sixfoldgreater risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, however, than non-farmers. Menwho used or mixed the herbicide had an eightfold increased risk.<T3>Comment:</T3> This well designed and conducted case-control study suffersfrom having to rely on memory for exposure data although its validity wasconfirmed in some instance by the reports of herbicide suppliers. The conclusionthat there is an association between exposure to 2,4-D and non-Hodgkin'slymphoma is supported by some other studies but not by all. In any event,the exposure to 2,4-D appears to have been more repetitive over a longerperiod for the Kansas farmers than for ground troops in Vietnam and thepresent study itself suggests a dose-effect relationship.(d) Hoffman et al. <T3>Health effects of long-term exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.</T3>More than 10 years after a road was sprayed with oil contianing 2,3,7,8-TCDD,the area had 39 to 1,100 parts per billion of the material in compositesoil samples and a single sample contained 2,200 ppb. From 207 householdswho had lived in the area for six months or longer after it was sprayed,154 persons agreed to be examined. A control group of 155 volunteers fromfive uncontaminated neighborhoods of 515 households was matched to theexposed individuals, except that the controls were of socio-economicallyand educationally higher status. An extensive medical and social evaluation,including history, physical and psychological examinations, and clinicallaboratory tests of each patient revealed no significant differences inhealth status, except that more often the exposed individuals has ``otherskin problems'' and ``other miscellaneous diseases.'' The exposed populationhad a higher incidence of some slightly abnormal liver function findingsbut slightly less frequent abnormal findings for others. Much attentionwas given to immunological evaluation, including skin tests, T-cell functionalassessments and T-cell surface marker determinations. Only the calculatednon-peripheral lymphocytes were considered to be more numerous in the exposedgroup. The anergy tests were rendered invalid because two of four readersproved unsatisfactory. In any event, immunological defects were not reflectedin the health of participiants. No clincial conditions thought to be associatedwith exposure to TCDD were found although the authors believe that theflawed skin tests and the immunological examinations indicated reducedcellular immunity in the exposed individuals.<T3>Comment:</T3> The findings in this study have been challenged on severalgrounds. The low participation rate and the improperly read skin testscannot be overlooked and the specific immunological results do not correspondto those induced by 2,3,7,8-TCDD in animals. Some differences between exposedand control groups are expected when so many variables are measured. Thereis incomplete description of the test methodology and of the quality controlsused. Further, the intensity of exposure to persistent TCDD in soil appearslikely to have been much greater in the area studied than in Vietnam. Thework provides no basis for the VA to alter its guidelines.(e) Jones and Chelsky.<T3> Further discussion concerning porphyria cutanea torda and TCDD esposure.</T3>Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a skin disease associated with disturbedliver metabolism leading to urinary excretion of abnormal porphyrins. Ithas been diagnosed and attributed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD only in a small numberof chemical workers in two plants. In each of these two plants, typicalcases of chloracne were present. Some workers had both PCT or abnormalurinary porphyrins and chloracne. Others had only PCT or urine changes.Still others had only chloracne. Each of the two plants used processesthat produced material containing 2,3,7,8-TCDD and a chemical, hexachlorobenzene,that is known to cause PCT and the associated urinary changes. The workerswho developed PCT all had contact with hexachlorobenzene in at least theone plant for which information is available and the authors believe thatcontact with it, rather than with 2,3,7,8-TCDD, caused the condition. Theychallenge as well the use of ``porphyria cutanea tarda'' as a name forthe condition in which the patient has only urinary changes and not thecomplete clinical condition.<T3>Comment:</T3> No plant in which exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD has been demonstratedhas encountered PCT among its employees other than the two plants discussed.This is true even when employees develop chloracne. Animals given 2,3,7,8-TCDD,however, develop chemical changes related to those found in PCT. It canbe argued that human exposures to 2,3,7,8-TCDD are not intense enough toproduce the disease, even though they cause the associated chemical changes.Even were this proved, it would not be relevant to veterans because theexposure levels required would be much greater than those suspected asbeing produced by spraying in Vietnam.(f) Lynge.<T3> A follow-up of cancer incidence among workers in manufacture of phenoxyherbicides in Denmark.</T3> In a retrospective cohort study, informationwas reviewed regardiing 4,459 workers in Danish factories manufacturingphenoxy herbicides prior to 1982. Of this number only 940 were employedin manufacturing and packaging such phenoxy herbicides and probably fewerstill were involved with 2,4,5-T, the herbicide containing 2,3,7,8-TCDD.The reported prevalence of cancers in the Danish population as a wholewas compared to that among the chemical workers. The latter had no greaterrisk of developing all types of cancer than did the entire population.Likewise, there was no increased prevalence of malignant lymphoma. Therewere, however, 5 cases of soft tissue sarcomas of various types among theworkers where 1.84 cases were expected. Of these 5, only one worker wasinvolved with manufacturing and shipping phenoxy herbicides; 3 of the 5worked only for 3 months or less in the chemical plants.<T3>Comments:</T3> While the study was well designed, executed, and reported,the unavoidably small numbers of persons involved make it difficult todraw definite conclusions. The results can be said to add marginally tothe evidence for an association between phenoxy herbicide exposure andsoft tissue sarcomas. With equal caution they tend to refute an associationwith malignant lymphoma.(g) Stehr et al. <T3>A pilot epidemiological study of possible health effects associatedwith 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in Missouri. </T3>A comparisonwas made of health indicators between two groups of people: those livingor working continuously or frequently in areas where the soil was contaminatedwith 20 or more parts per billion of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and, as controls, thosehaving no known contact with the chemical. Participants were selected fromamong individuals who responded to advertisements by completing a HealthEffect Survey questionnaire or by attending a ``dermatology screening clinic''for persons who feared exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Apparently non-randomselection yielded a ``high-risk'' group of 68 and a ``low-risk'' groupof 36, all of whom underwent detailed medical, clinical laboratory andimmunological examinations. The groups were not well matched as to ``regularexercise'' but there were no statistically significant differences in theresults of the extensive examinations.<T3>Comments:</T3> The work, which was published twice before in 1984,is not well reported with many details essential for critical review leftunstated. Since this was a pilot study, no definitive conclusions as toassociation between exposure and disease were expected and none were possible.(h) Wiklund and Holm. <T3>Soft tissue sarcoma risk in Swedish agriculture and forestry workers.</T3>In a record-linkage study, 354,620 Swedish male agricultural and forestryworkers were compared to 1,725,845 men otherwise employed in 1960. Theformer group was divided into 3 agriculture and 3 forestry subgroups whoseuse of herbicides was thought to differ by type of chemical and intensityof contact althought neither was quantitatively determinable. The occurrenceof soft tissue sarcomas was obtained from the Swedish ``Cancer-EnvironmentRegister''. The results indicated that none of the 6 exposed subgroupsnor the group as a whole had any increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma.Also there was no increasing risk during the increase in the use of herbicidesand/or the possible latency period from 1960 to 1975.<T3>Comments:</T3> While well planned, conducted, and reported, the studywas limited by an unavoidable lack of detailed exposure data as to amountand duration of herbicide use by any of the groups. The large number ofmen involved probably compensates for most sources of error and, at theleast, the study fails to support an association between herbicide exposureand soft tissue sarcoma, even in Sweden where the possible associationwas first reported.<ITAG tagnum="84">Meeting of April 27-28, 1987</ITAG>(i) Centers for Disease Control. <T3>Post service mortality among Vietnam veterans.</T3> The mortality experienceof Army veterans was examined for the 12 to 19 years following militaryservice in Vietnam. A sample of about 9,300 veterans had served in Vietnamand another 9,000 had been stationed elsewhere. The overall death ratewas 17 percent higher for the Vietnam veterans but this excess mortalityoccurred mainly during the five years following discharge when motor vehicleaccidents, suicides, homicides, and accidental poisonings accounted formost of the difference. The death rate during the ensuing years was similarin the two veterans groups except that the rate for drug-related deathscontinued to be greater among Vietnam veterans. On the other hand, thisgroup had a significantly lower death rate from cardiovascular diseasesthan did the non-Vietnam veterans and both groups had a lower mortalityrate for, ``natural causes'' than did men in the general U.S. population.The excess death rate within a few years after discharge among veteransserving in combat areas has been found also for veterans for World WarII and the Korean conflict.<T3>Comment:</T3> The study was well designed and conducted but the relativelysmall samples do not allow detailed analysis of subdivisions by types ofVietnam service or experiences. Similarly, confounding factors cannot beconsidered. The results pertain only to the effect of experience as a wholein Vietnam and therefore shed no light specifically on the effects of exposureto Agent Orange.(j) Constable and Hatch. <T3>Reproductive effects of herbicide exposures in Vietnam.</T3> Nine studiesof the reproductive effects of exposure to Agent Orange were reported ata 1983 international symposium in Vietnam but remain unavailable in publishedform. The review of these reports shows numerous epidemiological defectsincluding inadequate and unreliable data, lack of appropriate baselinedata, selection biases, and confounding variables. Constable and Hatchconcluded, however, that potential herbicide exposure of the father maybe associated with an increase in various congenital defects and that exposureof the mother may be associated with hydatidiform mole.<T3>Comment:</T3> The recognized defects in all these studies and the inaccessibilityof the data make it impossible to give credence to them. The reported effectsof the father's exposure are in direct contrast to the results of betterperformed studies in the United States and Australia. No credence can begiven to the Vietnamese findings.(k) Environmental Protection Agency. <T3>Health Assessment Document for Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins.</T3>This 1985 review of various cases, reports and published epidemiologicalstudies concentrated on the association of exposure to dioxins and substancescontaining them with such effects as soft-tissue sarcoma, porphyria cutaneatarda, metabolic disturbances, lymphomas, and stomach cancer. The authorsconcluded that there is ``a strong suggestion that phenoxyacetic acid herbicides,chlorophenols, or their impurities are carcinogenic in humans'' but ``thereis less evidence incriminating 2,4,5-T and/or 2,3,7,8-TCDD as the causeof malignant lymphoma and stomach cancer in humans.''<T3>Comment:</T3> The review is now outdated. The EPA has modified itsbeliefs in the carcinogicity of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and is now less certain ofthe association. The review has been criticized by experts for its ``almostadvocacy tone'' and, in any event, it does not present data unreportedelsewhere.(l) Hall. <T3>The Agent Orange controversy after the Evatt Royal Commission.</T3>The Evatt Royal Commission of the Australian Parliament issued in 1985its ``Report on the Use and Effects of Chemical Agents on Australian Personnelin Vietnam.'' The nine-volume report gives details of a two-year investigationinto the ``standard of proof'' used in judging the effects of chemicalagents; exposure data; toxicological results; general health effects; reproductiveoutcomes; cancer; and mental well-being, as well as mortality in a broadsense. The Commission concluded that Australian veterans were not exposedto toxic levels of chemicals, including Agent Orange, in Vietnam and hadno increased risk of fathering children with birth defects nor of developingcancer. Vietnam veterans had slightly increased rates of psychiatric disorders,heart disease, alcoholism and alcohol-related diseases but these effectswere not attributed to exposure to chemicals in Vietnam.<T3>Comment:</T3> This summary emphasizes the lack of evidence to supportclaims made by Vietnam veterans that their health has been impaired byexposure to Agent Orange and other chemicals in Vietnam. It does not contributenew data nor does it present in detail the evidence collected by the RoyalCommission.(m) Hatch and Stein. <T3>Agent Orange and risks to reproduction.</T3> The authors review criticallythe studies published regarding the effect of service in Vietnam on thelikelihood of veterans fathering defective children or having other reproductivedefects. The studies considered include those of the Australian Government,the Centers for Disease Control, and the Air Force. After examining thedata with various analytical techniques to evaluate the ``strength of association,''specificity, consistency, and coherence as well as the results of animalinvestments, the authors conclude that for the majority of men exposedto Agent Orange there is no evidence of even a moderately increased riskof fathering a defective child. They believe that epidemiology cannot makefurther contributions to establishing or refuting a causal connection.<T3>Comment:</T3> No previously reported data are presented in this reviewand its conclusions neither support nor refute claims for a causal relationor even an association between a veteran's exposure to Agent Orange andhis risk of fathering a defective child.(n) Kang et al. <T3>Soft tissue sarcomas and military service in Vietnam. </T3>The VA'sPatient Treatment File contains information, including diagnoses, on allpatients discharged from VA hospitals. All cases diagnosed as soft tissuesarcomas from 1969 through 1983 were identified and medical records wereexamined to verify the diagnoses. The 234 patients verified were comparedto 13,496 randomly selected patients with other diagnoses; all had militaryservice during the Vietnam era. The military records of the veterans wereexamined to determine service in Vietnam; 38 percent of the sarcoma patientsand 41 percent of the control group had Vietnam service. Such service,therefore, had no increased association with the occurrence of soft tissuesarcomas. It was also noted that the relative incidence of the sarcomaswas constant over the years in which the patients were discharged fromthe hospital. Exposure to Agent Orange or other specific hazards was notdetermined.<T3>Comment:</T3> The authors recognize limitations of the study, especiallythe short time between discharge from service and hospitalization for thesoft tissue sarcoma in many cases. Selecting the study cases exclusivelyfrom patients in VA hospitals may allow selection bias. At best the resultsallow only conclusions as to the lack of association between Vietnam serviceand soft tissue sarcomas without reference to Agent Orange exposure asa determining factor.(o) MacMahon. <T3>Review of Hoar et al. and related literature. </T3>Brian MacMahon,M.D., Ph.D., at the request of the EPA critically reviewed the 1986 paperby Hoar, Blair, et al. (See c. above) and some related publications. Theauthor described the study as ``carefully and competently carried out''with a ``strong and statistically significant risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphomawith increasing frequency of herbicide use'' (predominantly uracil andphenoxyacetic acids) but weak association with the years of use. He pontedout several discrepancies in the results but concluded that taken alonethe Kansas ``study would stand as a good basis for the hypothesis thatthe risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is increased by agricultural exposureto phenoxyacetic acids_principally 2,4-D_and perhaps other herbicides.''The results, however, do not establish association between exposure andlymphomas. Other studies weaken even the basis for an hypothesis.<T3>Comment:</T3> The expert review supports the conclusion that the paperby Hoar et al. does not establish an association between exposure to theingredients, especially 2,4-D, of Agent Orange and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.The Hoar study does provide the basis, rather than proof, of such an hypothesis.(p) Patterson et al. <T3>2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin levels in adipose tissue of exposedand control persons in Missouri.</T3> Fat samples were obtained for 39volunteers with a history of exposure to TCDD. They had lived for two yearsor longer in or near an area where soil levels of TCDD measured 20 to 100parts per billion or for six months where the levels were greater than100 ppb; had ridden or cared for horses at least every week in contaminatedhorse arenas; or had worked in hexachlorophene production or in areas sprayedwith dioxin-containing wastes. The control group of 57 persons were patientsundergoing elective surgery and with no known exposures to TCDD. Most controlpatients had 8 or less parts per trillion in their fat; their arithmeticmean was 7.4 ppt. of TCDD; none had more than 20 ppt. In contrast 19, or49 percent, of exposed persons had levels exceeding 20 ppt. and one reached750 ppt.; the arithmetic mean of the group was 90.8 ppt. <T3>Comment: </T3>The results of this study agree with those of earlierinvestigations that TCDD can be detected in the fat of individuals whohave had no known exposure to the chemical. Elevated levels of the chemicalare found in individuals with known exposure even years after the contactand may serve as an indicator of exposure to TCDD. A quantitative relationshipbetween the intensity of exposure is suggested by the fact that five ofthe six individuals with levels exceeding 100 ppt. had been involved inthe manufacture of hexacholorphene which had contained TCDD. The complexityof the assay and the necessity for an operation to obtain the fat samplerestrict the procedure to use as a research tool. No information is includedin the report as to the health status of individuals with high TCDD levels.(q) Pearn. <T3>Herbicides and congenital malformations. </T3>A review of the toxicologyand teratogenicity in animals and man supports the opinion that 2,4-D and2,4,5-T are of low toxicity and teratogenicity in primates. 2,3,7,8-TCDDis highly teratogenic in rodents and 2,4-D is less so. Epidemiologicaldata, however, indicate only slight toxicity and no firm evidence of teratogenicityor other reproductive toxicity in humans for 2,3,7,8-TCDD or the phenoxyaceticherbicides.   <T3>Comment: </T3>The review presents no new data and no basis for recommendingchanges in VA policy.   (r) Webb. <T3>The diagnosis of dioxin-associated illness. </T3>A review of publishedmaterial leads to the statement that acute exposure to 1,000 parts perbillion of 2,3,7,8-TCDD may cause chloracne, abnormally increased urinaryporphyrins, and porphyria cutanea tarda. Increased porphyrin excretionhas been said to persist for several years after exposure. Less specificeffects of abnormal liver function, peripheral neuropathy, hyperlipidemia,weakness, and depression have been reported for a few months after exposure.Long-term effects after exposure to small amounts of TCDD cannot be evaluated.  <T3>Comment: </T3>No new facts or interpretations are presented by thereview. The reported acute effects occurred at exposure levels of TCDD(1,000 ppb) far in excess of any suspected for ground troops in Vietnam.The review, therefore, provides no basis for changes in VA policy.

It urges the nurses to becomefamiliar with ``the signs and symptoms of toxic chemical exposure'' andto learn the available facilities and testing procedures relevant to careof such veterans and their families.<T3>Comments: </T3>No new data are given in the review and it presentsno basis for change in VA policy or procedures.   (t) Wolfe et al. <T3>An epidemiological investigation of health effects in Air Force personnelfollowing exposure to herbicides. </T3>The fourth annual mortality reportof data for the Ranch Hand group and the comparison cohort are not extensivelyanalyzed since only 4 of the former and 27 of the latter died during theyear. Prior to 12/13/85, 4.7 percent of the Ranch Handers and 5.1 percentof the comparison cohort had died, a statistically insignificant differencebetween the groups. There was no evidence for an increased incidence ofone or more causes of death suggestive of an effect from exposure of theRanch Handers to Agent Orange.   <T3>Comment: </T3>Data from the study of Ranch Handers is the most relevantinformation available as to possible health effects of exposure to AgentOrange. This interim report on mortality provides no evidence of an adverseeffect and no basis for changing VA policy.   (u) Woods et al. <T3>Soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma in relation to phenoxyherbicide and chlorinated phenol exposure in Western Washington. </T3>Detailedoccupational histories of 128 soft tissue sarcoma patients, 576 non-Hodgkins'slymphoma patients and 694 individuals without cancer provide the data fora population-based case-control study of casual factors for the two malignancies.The samples were composed of men, aged 20 to 79 diagnosed between 1981and 1984 in western Washington, an area where agriculture and forestryare common occupations. Any past exposure to phenoxy herbicides was associatedwith a relative risk of 0.80 for soft tissue sarcoma and of 1.07 for non-Hodgkin'slymphoma. Exposure to chlorophenol gave relative risks of 0.99 for bothmalignancies. These represent no significant changes from the expectedprevalence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma nor was there an increased risk relatedto the duration or intensity of exposure and none to contact with a specificphenoxy herbicide. Farmers and forestry herbicide applicators, however,had relative risks of 1.33 and 4.80, respectively, of developing lymphoma.Men exposed to phenoxy herbicides for at least 15 years during a period15 years before diagnosis had a relative risk of 1.71. These risks aresignificantly increased but so are those following exposure to other substancessuch as DDT and organic solvents. While the results indicate that prolongedexposure to phenoxy herbicides increases slightly the risk of developingnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma, they provide no evidence of an association withsoft tissue sarcoma.   <T3>Comment: </T3>This study was well designed and executed but it hasthe limitations inherent in epidemiological research. It does contributeevidence that there is no association between phenoxy herbicides and softtissue sarcomas and provides evidence that a long continued exposure tophenoxy herbicides, which include the two principal ingredients of AgentOrange, slightly increases the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary Comments and Conclusions:   </ITAG>In arriving at conclusions regarding the risk of health defects attributableto exposure to Agent Orange, consideration has been given to the studiescommented on by the mandated VA Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazardsand listed above. Other research reported in the <T3>Review of Literature on Herbicides, Including Phenoxy Herbicides andAssociated Dioxins, </T3>especially in volumes IX and X, has influencedthe decisions as well. More recent research which will be reported in furtherreviews to be published by the Veterans Administration in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>provides information that influences currentopinions. The Centers for Disease Control has developed data indicatingthat dioxin can be found at levels below 20 parts per trillion in the bloodof a considerable proportion of people never exposed to Agent Orange andthat the blood concentration correlates well with the concentrations foundin fat. Dioxin persists in elevated concentrations in the blood of manyRanch Hand veterans; the blood of Vietnam veterans who served as groundtroops has shown no evidence of concentrations higher than those of individualswho are known not to have been exposed to Agent Orange. These results arenot in conflict with the dioxin content found in the fat of the two categoriesof Vietnam-era veterans. They strongly suggest that ground troops in Vietnamhas little or no contact with Agent Orange, contact that would have resultedin an increased content of dioxin in their fat and blood.At present, it is concluded that: (1) The long interval since Vietnam service (in excess of 13 years at present)precludes the appearance today of acute effects from exposure to AgentOrange or its dioxin contaminant. (2) Evidence to date has not supported the belief that service in Vietnamhas significantly jeopardized the health or longevity of veterans exceptduring the first five years after the conflict and in the occurrence ofdrug abuse. (3) The long latency of various cancers could result in their increasedincidence as delayed consequence of exposures in Vietnam. Evidence forassociation between exposures to phenoxy herbicides, including Agent Orange,or the contaminant 2,3,7,8-TCDD and malignancies remains conflicting orabsent, however. Soft tissue sarcomas were postulated to be causally relatedto phenoxy herbicides but recent evidence has not supported the hypothesis.Association of herbicide exposure and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was also postulated;recent evidence is conflcting and suggests that any causal effect is weak.At present, it does not warrant a change in the VA finding of no provedrole for Agent Orange as a causal factor. (4) Mounting evidence against significant exposure of ground troops toAgent Orange makes its role in the health of Vietnam veterans questionable.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-23287 Filed 10-7-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8320-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
