The package of thrift-related measures passed by thecommittee in a voice vote includes increased spending forenforcement, new criminal penalties for fraud and thecreation of a national commission to determine the origins ofthe Sandamp;L debacle and recommend solutions.</LP><TEXT>   An amendment offered by Rep. George Sangmeister (D., Ill.)and approved by voice vote would require life sentences forthe kingpins in Sandamp;L fraud schemes.   The thrift measures were added to a broader anti-crimebill that received final approval from the committee lastnight. The Senate earlier this month approved its own packageof Sandamp;L legislation, which has similar goals but differs inmany specifics from the measures approved by the House panel.   The Bush administration has backed many of thecongressional proposals, but not all. For example, the WhiteHouse strongly opposes the creation of a bipartisaninvestigative commission as an unnecessary new bureaucracy.   The House legislation would create new criminal offensesfor concealing assets from a receiver of a failed thrift andfor obstructing a government examination of a financialinstitution. The bill would also authorize $153 million foreach of the next three years to hire more prosecutors andagents devoted strictly to cases involving financialinstitutions. That amount is $9.5 million a year less thanwhat the Senate approved.   These provisions reflect lawmakers' tendency to stressthat criminal activity caused many of the failures in the Sandamp;Lindustry. Charging that the Bush Justice Department has movedtoo slowly to investigate thrift fraud, Rep. Charles Schumer(D., N.Y.), lead sponsor of the House measures, said, &quot;It iscritical that the administration prosecute, convict andpunish those who committed crimes against the Sandamp;L industry.&quot;   Most law enforcement officials, however, contend that thevast majority of thrift failures resulted from mismanagement,lack of government supervision and loosening of industryregulations by Congress in the early 1980s. Moreover,whatever new criminal statutes Congress ultimately passeswon't apply retroactively to acts committed before thesanctions are signed into law by the president.   On the civil side, the House legislation would giveprosecutors and bank regulators the authority to undofraudulent transactions by thrift executives. Under the bill,Sandamp;L defendants would be barred from using the bankruptcy lawsas a shield from court judgments, and regulators couldprohibit &quot;golden parachute&quot; severance payments to thriftexecutives.   ---   Timothy Noah contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
