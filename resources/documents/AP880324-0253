Iran said its troops advanced farther into Iraq's northeasternKurdistan province, killing or wounding 1,000 Iraqi soldiers, in aweek-old offensive. Iraq denied the claim.   Shipping executives in the Persian Gulf said the captain of the267,589-ton Friendship L supertanker reported a fire in the engineroom, raising speculation the vessel may have been raided.   They said a later report from the ship, which is on charter toIran, reported the fire extinguished and denied there had been anattack.   In Amman, Jordan, Iran left an Islamic conference after otherdelegates criticized it for not heeding calls to accept acease-fire in the war, which began in September 1980, and accusedit of instigating bloody riots last year in the holy city of Mecca,Saudi Arabia.   Dispatches from Iraq said 13 people were killed and 68 woundedin two missile explosions in downtown Baghdad. Iran said fourmissiles were fired at Baghdad.   One victim was a woman who was breast-feeding her newborn babyin a hospital bed. The infant survived, the official Iraqi NewsAgency reported.   Nine houses were demolished in the attacks and two otherchildren were among the victims, it said.   The Iraqis said they launched six long-range missiles at Tehran.Iran reported 10 civilians killed and 100 wounded, and said therockets hit two schools, two mosques and two hospitals.   Iraq has fired 42 missiles into Tehran since March 15. Iran saysit has fired 16 missiles into Baghdad and dozens of short-rangerockets at other Iraqi cities.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's parliament, said Iranwould use chemical weapons if no action was taken against Iraq.   ``We asked the U.N. to send experts to the Halabja region (innortheast Iraq) to inspect the effects of the chemical weapons,''he said on Tehran radio.   ``If the international organizations refuse to take any step topunish Iraq, we shall not remain idle. We have the technology toproduce chemical weapons, and although we have not exploited thisyet, we will not remain idle forever.''   He said Iran has decided ``to punish the aggressor ourselves,''renewing warnings that Iranian troops along the 733-mile borderwould launch an all-out offensive.   ``At present we have forces and operational plans all over thebattlefront, and should the U.N. Security Council refuse to takeany step towards condemning the aggressor, we shall begin ouroperation,'' Rafsanjani declared.   Iran has said 5,000 people were killed and 5,000 wounded whenIraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on Halabja, Khormal andDojaila, three Kurdish towns captured by the Iranians last week.   Most of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds live in the northeast and Iransupports them in a struggle for autonomy.   Western reporters flown to Halabja by the Iranians earlier thisweek reported seeing hundreds of dead civilians, unmarked bywounds. They said many had died of asphyxiation, apparently caughtunaware in their homes.   U.S. State Department spokesman Charled Redman said Wednesday inWashington that Iraq had used chemical weapons, banned under a 1925Geneva agreement, and urged the U.N. Security Council to protest.He called the Iraqi action ``a particularly grave violation.''   Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency said Iranian planesThursday inadvertently violated Turkish airspace and dropped twobombs over southeastern Turkey near the Harbur border post,breaking windows but causing no casualties.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu confirmed the area wasbombed but said the planes' nationality was not known yet.   Anatolia said the Iranian jets were raiding northern Iraq whenthey strayed over Turkey.   On Tuesday, two Iraqi jets violated Turkish airspace when theybombed Kurdish guerrilla bases in a joint security zone along theborder.</TEXT></DOC>
