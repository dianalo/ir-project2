McConnell and five others in one of the biggest banking-fraud cases in history.    The indictments are the first following the collapse of Mr. McConnell's $280 million real-estate empire, which began unraveling last year, but they are unlikely to be the last charges filed in the case, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation officials. &quot;This indictment reflects only a segment of the entire FBI investigation,&quot; said Henry K. Oncken, U.S. attorney here.    Law enforcement officials said Mr. McConnell was the &quot;mastermind&quot; of a &quot;sophisticated scheme&quot; to defraud banks, savings and loan associations and others of more than $162 million, partly through the use of &quot;straw borrowers&quot; and bogus real-estate title reports. The FBI said it believes the case represents &quot;the largest bank fraud in U.S. history utilizing title insurance.&quot; Four of the others indicted were bankers and one the president of a title-insurance firm.    The FBI said the 1 1/2-year investigation of Mr. McConnell's affairs was part of a larger probe of fraudulent-banking activity in financially depressed Houston. In fact, on Oct. 1, the bureau assembled a task force of 22 special agents, many with accounting backgrounds, &quot;to handle the ever-increasing fraudulent activities against financial institutions&quot; here.    The whereabouts of 40-year-old Mr. McConnell, who amassed his real-estate empire and its $427.8 million in debt in only a few years, remain unknown.    Rumors have placed Mr. McConnell as far away as Mexico, though several people claim they have seen him recently in the Houston area. &quot;We don't know at this time,&quot; said Andrew J. Duffin, head of the FBI's Houston office. He said an arrest warrant would be issued.    Asked where Mr. McConnell's money is, John Smith, the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case, said, &quot;We don't have any idea where it all is.&quot;    Despite the mystery of his location, Mr. McConnell surfaced in a fashion on the day of his indictment. Yesterday's editions of the Houston Post contained a small advertisement purchased by Mr. McConnell in which he assured creditors of repayment and asserted he was &quot;not giving up.&quot;    The Post received the ad through the mail and spoke briefly with Mr. McConnell, said Sue Beck, national advertising manager. She said he paid by money order -- with no return address. &quot;The FBI asked the same thing,&quot; she added.    Mr. McConnell built his empire at the depths of a real-estate depression in oil-busted Houston in the mid-1980s, often mortgaging the same piece of property over and over by hiding liens, according to records in U.S. civil and bankruptcy courts here. Law enforcement authorities said he kept his colleagues, lenders and others in the dark about the scope of his buying and borrowing through &quot;compartmentalized&quot; actions of which only he was fully aware.    In one transaction detailed in the six-count indictment, Mr. McConnell and others defrauded Home Savings Association of Houston by borrowing money on a property they didn't own and then using most of the borrowings to repay other loans from the same institution. As previously reported, Mr. McConnell controlled hundreds of pieces of property in Houston with a value of about $280 million.    The property in question -- the Princessa Apartments in Houston -- was owned by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. at the time that Mr. McConnell's group used it as collateral, the indictment says.    The indictment says a contract was prepared showing that the FDIC's apartments had been sold by a corporation -- which didn't exist -- to Griffith P. Temple, formerly a senior vice president of Allied Addicks Bank, a unit of Allied Bancshares Inc., one of the city's biggest financial institutions. Then, the indictment says, Mary Lynne Smith, president of Federal Title Co., represented that Mr. Temple held a clear title to the apartments.    With the title in hand, the indictment says, Mr. Temple obtained a $3.7 million loan from Home Savings that was facilitated by H. Wayne Gray, a lending officer linked to Mr. McConnell. The funds were used to repay existing loans at Home Savings and to fund certain McConnell enterprises, the indictment says.    Named in the indictment with Mr. Temple, Ms. Smith and Mr. Gray were Walter Beard and Candace Temple, who were loan officers at Texas National Bank.    Michael Hinton, attorney for Mr. and Mrs. Temple, said his clients would plead innocent and were &quot;absolutely denying all charges.&quot;    &quot;They were dupes&quot; in a scheme orchestrated by Mr. McConnell, Mr. Hinton charged.    Mr. Hinton said Mr. Temple was led by Mr. McConnell to believe that the title documents were legitimate and the properties were transferred to him as &quot;a reward by Mr. McConnell for his services.&quot; Other defendants or their attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.    Each count in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. </TEXT></DOC>
