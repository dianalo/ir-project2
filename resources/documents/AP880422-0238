In an interview with American reporters before an official visitto Washington next week, Mulroney said:   ``The United States would be pretty upset with me if I weredumping my garbage in your backyard. Well, this is what's happeningexcept it's coming from above.''   Canada claims that 50 percent of the acid rain damaging itswaterways and forests comes from U.S. smokestacks across theborder. For more than seven years, it has urged the United Statesto legislate reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide.   President Reagan, on advice from the Environmental ProtectionAgency, says more research is needed before embarking on costlyclean-up measures.   ``I don't accept his view at all,'' said Mulroney, who has builtotherwise close relations with his fellow conservative.   ``When lakes and rivers and streams and forests are dying beforeyour eyes, you don't need a great deal of further research.''   In Parliament Friday, opposition Liberal Party member Herb Grayaccused Reagan of believing acid rain is caused by ``ducks, birdsand trees'' and demanded that Mulroney present the United Stateswith a multimillion-dollar bill for damage to Canadian forests andlakes.   But Mulroney, interviewed in his office, said he favored thecivil approach. All nations have differences, he said. ``Do youdeclare a war?''   He said he had not given up on Reagan, but will use aninvitation to address both houses of Congress next Wednesday tourge American legislators to act on their own.   ``I'll accept an acid rain treaty irrespective of which end ofPennsylvania Avenue initiates action,'' the prime minister said.   He said many members of Congress support the fight against acidrain, and he forecast that all three leading contenders for thepresidency, Republican Vice President George Bush and DemocratsMichael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, would be strong advocates forthe environment.   But he added: ``I'm not pinning my hopes on any individual.''   Canada reports 14,000 lifeless lakes and 19 barren salmon riversbecause of acid rain. It began its own cleanup in 1985, aimed atreducing its sulfur emissions 50 percent by 1994. It wants theUnited States to do the same.   Mulroney said there will be a treaty eventually on cutting downon cross-border acid rain, ``that is for certain. The only questionis when. It won't be tomorrow, but it's going to come _ soonerrather than later.''   He said Americans should care that they are ruining thenortheastern part of the continent and damaging relations withtheir ``best friend, neighbor and ally, Canada.''   Despite press speculation that he will call an election thisfall, a year before his five-year term expires, Mulroney said:``I'm not even thinking about an election.''   The 49-year-old leader of the Progressive Conservative Partysaid his government has a full legislative program this year,including ratification of the Free Trade Agreement with the UnitedStates, a constitutional accord recognizing Quebec as a ``distinctsociety,'' a day care program and the privatization of Air Canada.   ``We've got a hell of a lot of business to do before I'm goingto start considering elections,'' he said.   He forecast victory when he does call an election. The latestpolls indicate the three Canadian parties neck-and-neck and theConservatives on the rise.</TEXT></DOC>
