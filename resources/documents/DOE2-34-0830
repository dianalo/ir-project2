The system includesa standard 55 KW Bonus wind turbine and a 30 KW diesel generator set,modified with a clutch and a flywheel. The system has been in experimentaloperation since early 1985 while at the same time a commercial developmentof Wind/Diesel systems has been underway in Denmark, to a considerableextent based on the concepts of Risoe's experimental system. The paperdescribes the basic principles and philosophy of the system, and theoreticaland experimental results on the system are presented. The system conceptis evaluated, and the impact of the features of the system on commercialsystem design and performance is discussed. 12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
