Redman.   After three days of anti-Chinese rioting, official reports haveput the death toll in the violence at 12. But Tibetans say far morehave been killed, most shot to death by security forces.   The unrest, the latest in an 18-month series of demonstrations,has developed into the most serious challenge to Chinese rule innearly three decades.   Thousands of Chinese troops have converged on Lhasa, the remoteTibetan city where martial law was declared Tuesday after three daysof anti-Chinese rioting.   The disturbances began on Sunday, when demonstrators protestingChinese rule began rioting, stoning police and building bonfires ofgoods looted from Chinese-owned stores.   Redman, asked about the State Department's reaction, noted thathe has spoken on the matter several times recently.   He said the U.S. government had approached the Chinese ForeignMinistry and its State Nationalities Affairs Commission about theproblem.   ``We stressed a concern in the United States over human rights inTibet, deplored the violence which has led to many deaths andinjuries, and asked for an assessment of developments in Tibet andthe likely duration of martial law,'' Redman said. ``While werecognize the right of a government to maintain order, we object tounwarranted use of lethal force.''</TEXT></DOC>
