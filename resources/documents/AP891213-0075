An article in the party daily Neues Deutschland said theCommunists also will continue to resist reunification with WestGermany.   In the detailed proposal for restructuring the party, theCommunists called for a course that adheres to ``socialist,anti-fascist, pacifist and all international leftist traditions,especially those of Lenin.''   The proposal is to be considered at the continuation thisweekend of the party's special congress. The session began Fridaybut suspended its work after naming a new party leader, reformerGregor Gysi.   Despite the reaffirmation of socialism, the party leadership hasbeen overhauled to remove hard-liners and install reformers in aneffort to appease the restive populace, which is demandingdemocratic change and has thrown its support to the opposition.   The party will have to compete for power against a powerfulopposition movement in May, when East Germany holds what are to beits first free and open elections. The vote is set for May6.   Also today, the East German government expanded its cooperationwith West Germany with an agreement under which Bonn willcontribute about $540 million for 17 environmental improvementprojects in East Germany.   The agreement was announced in Bonn by West German EnvironmentalMinister Klaus Toepfer.   East German cities also have been appealing for food aid, forhelp in preparing free elections and for advice on a range ofreforms that have drastically changed municipal operations.   At a conference in Cologne, West German municipal authoritiesreported that they had been overwhelmed with calls for assistancefrom their East German sister cities.   West Germany has offered massive aid to East Germany oncondition some capitalist reforms are undertaken. But theCommunist-led government has agreed to discuss only thosecooperative ventures that fit into the socialist structure of theeconomy.   Communist Premier Hans Modrow and other top officials also haverepeatedly rejected West German efforts to merge the German states,though they have expressed interest in closer ties that benefitboth sides.   Meanwhile, the opposition group New Forum has filed a criminalcomplaint against former Communist leader Egon Krenz and the headof the secret police force for allegedly destroying evidence neededin probes of corruption among ousted high party officials.   The official ADN news agency reported the accusations madeagainst Krenz and Wolfgang Schwanitz. The decision to seek chargesagainst the two was made at a New Forum meeting in Leipzig.   On Tuesday, Modrow met with Secretary of State James A. BakerIII, who expressed U.S. support for the democratic reformsintroduced in East Germany.   Under the rule of ousted leader Erich Honecker, relationsbetween the United States and East Germany often were tense,largely because of the Berlin Wall and other barriers to freemovement that were enforced with shoot-to-kill orders.   Baker's meeting with Modrow was held in Potsdam, where Britain,the United States and the Soviet Union mapped out Germany's futurein 1945 after the defeat of Nazi Germany.   More than four decades later, East Germany is undergoing itsbiggest upheaval since its founding in 1949. Two sets of Communistleaders have been ousted since Oct. 18.   But the growing demands for German reunification have threatenedto split the opposition movement.   The Communists are fighting for their political lives just twomonths after their iron-fisted rule began crumbling. Still, theCommunists control most of the top posts, and one of the majoropposition forces is urging Modrow's government to resign beforeChristmas.   After meeting with Modrow for an hour, Baker said it wasimportant that reforms in East Germany move forward ``peacefullyand in a stable way'' and that this was the major ``politicalsignal'' of his visit.   He spoke outside the Potsdam Hotel after becoming thehighest-ranking U.S. official to visit East Germany in nearly twodecades. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1974.   Baker said he told Modrow the United States was pleased that theCommunists and the opposition had agreed on May 6 as the date forfree elections.   Modrow, 61, said East Germany saw Baker's visit ``without adoubt'' as support for the process of reforms.   ``This visit is a political sign that the U.S. follows thedevelopments in (East Germany) with attention,'' Modrow said. ``Westarted a dialogue with each other today.''   Modrow said his government believed ``this dialogue would leadto cooperation.''   Later, Modrow met with U.S. House Majority Leader RichardGephardt of Missouri, Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., and Sen. RobertKerrey, D-Neb., according to the official East German news agencyADN.</TEXT></DOC>
