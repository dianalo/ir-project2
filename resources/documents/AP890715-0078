(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle Columbia moved to thelaunch pad Saturday as workers got set to celebrate the 20thanniversary of the liftoff of another spaceship with the same name,the one that carried the first men to the moon.   The shuttle completed a seven-hour trip to launch pad 39B shortlybefore 5 a.m., and engineers and technicians began readying it foran early August flight with five astronauts who are to release asecret military spy satellite. Meanwhile, others made preparationsfor Sunday's commemoration of the flight of the first Columbia.   It was July 16, 1969, that an Apollo command module Columbiablasted away from the Kennedy Space Center here with astronauts NeilArmstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and Michael Collins. Four dayslater, Armstrong and Aldrin climbed into the lunar landing vehicleEagle and descended to the moon.   After an historic 22 hours on the surface, the moonwalkersrejoined Collins in mother ship Columbia for the three-day trip home.   The three were at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,Ala., on Saturday for a ceremony there before coming here here tojoin with thousands Sunday in remembering the launch of the Apollo11 mission.   Outside the giant shuttle assembly building, where Apollo'sSaturn 5 rockets once were put together, the former astronauts willmake brief remarks and listen to a tape recording of the finalminutes of their countdown.   The ``taped liftoff'' will occur at 9:32 a.m. Sunday, preciselythe time they left Earth.   As the shuttle Columbia moved to the pad, shuttle launch directorBob Sieck looked back at its namesake.   ``Twenty years ago there was another spaceship, also calledColumbia, and it was out at the pad,'' he said. ``It had animportant mission and an important payload. This parallels it.Shuttle Columbia also has an important mission and an importantpayload.   ``It also will prove we have three orbiters, and that issignificant,'' Sieck said.   Columbia will be making its first flight since the Challengerexplosion 3{ years ago. The other two shuttles, Discovery andAtlantis, each have been launched twice since flights resumed lastSeptember.   After the ceremony here Sunday morning, Armstrong, Aldrin andCollins will ride 20 miles in a motorcade to Cocoa Beach, where theywill be honored at a luncheon. On Thursday, the 20th anniversary ofthe moon landing, the trio will join President Bush for a ceremonyat the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.   NASA earlier had set July 31 as the date for launching shuttleColumbia. But agency officials said Thursday that preparations werebehind schedule and that a liftoff now is expected during the firstweek in August. A firm launch date will be set July 26 following atwo-day meeting called a flight readiness review.   Columbia's all-military crew is to deploy a classified DefenseDepartment payload believed to be an advanced reconnaissancesatellite.   While the counterparts from 1969 are being honored, the shuttleastronauts will fly here Sunday from Houston, in preparation forsome practice sessions Monday and Tuesday.   The crew is commanded by Air Force Col. Brewster H. Shaw Jr. Theothers are Navy Cmdr. Richard N. Richards, Navy Cmdr. David C.Leestma, Air Force Lt. Col. James C. Adamson and Air Force Maj. MarkN. Brown.</TEXT></DOC>
