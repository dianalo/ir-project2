All of the witnesses who appeared Thursday before a HouseForeign Affairs subcommittee acknowledged that significant andunanticipated human rights advances have taken place under theleadership of the Soviet president.   But all said the new freedoms of glasnost have been incompleteand halting.   ``It's a case of two steps forward, one step back, and everyday's newspaper is evidence of that,'' said Holly Burkhalter,Washington director of Helsinki Watch, the observer group thatmonitors human rights developments in the Soviet Union.   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah and the subcommittee's chairman,outlined the more positive developments in the Soviet Union,including the expansion of legitimate private enterprise, broadenedreligious rights, a more independent press, greater freedom ofexpression, a less oppressive KGB, psychiatric reforms and adramatic increase in emigration.   But Owens and the witnesses said the silver cloud has a darklining.   ``Paradoxically, glasnost has sometimes led to increased humanrights abuses, as the authorities have countered with new types ofrepression, including the killing of peaceful demonstrators,'' Ms.Burkhalter said.   She said that while 600 or so longtime political prisoners havebeen released since 1987, at least 100 ``prisoners of conscience''remain imprisoned.   Soviet authorities have increased short-term detentions, holdingas many as 150 people a month for up to 15 days, she said.   And although the Gorbachev government has taken important stepsto curb the use of psychiatry to control political dissenters,about 50 people continue to be held in psychiatric institutions forpolitical reasons, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
