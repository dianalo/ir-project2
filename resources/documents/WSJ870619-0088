Because of Eastern Europe's signs of cooperation, the Reagan administration has decided not to publish a white paper on Abu Nidal, which suggests that the terrorist has found either refuge or assistance from all six of the Soviet Union's East European allies. The State Department report, based on a classified intelligence report drafted by the Central Intelligence Agency, contains no evidence that the Soviets themselves have provided any direct aid to Abu Nidal or to his terrorist group, which goes by the same name.    At the same time, intelligence sources said that reconnaissance photographs and other evidence have convinced CIA analysts that the Syrians this spring shut down training camps used by Abu Nidal. A senior official said U.S. intelligence agencies haven't been able to trace a terrorist attack back to Syria for more than a year, and Syria recently has refused to allow Abu Nidal to return to his former headquarters from Libya.    &quot;It is an important initial sign that for whatever reasons, economic or political, Syria sees that it can achieve gains by cooperating with the West over terrorism,&quot; the senior official said.    The new intelligence report doesn't charge the Soviet bloc countries with providing Abu Nidal with arms or training. But it does say his group has been operating front companies in Eastern Europe to launder money and provide revenue and has been given freedom of movement in and out of the countries.    &quot;His business is not dissimilar to the Mafia's,&quot; one administration official said.    Bulgaria, East Germany and Poland have been particularly helpful to Abu Nidal. Intelligence sources believe Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, has received medical treatment in East Berlin. Also, one of his group's trademarks had been its use of Polish-made WZ-63 machine pistols.    Still, U.S. knowledge of Abu Nidal remains sketchy: A CIA analyst recently told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Abu Nidal was born in what is now the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In fact, other intelligence officials said later, Sabry al-Banna was born in 1937 in Jaffa, just south of Tel Aviv.    His group has been connected to more than 60 terrorist attacks during the past eight years. Those attacks include the December 1985 Rome and Vienna airport massacres, the hijacking of an Egyptian airliner to Malta and last August's simultaneous attack on an Istanbul synagogue and hijacking of a Pan Am jet in Pakistan.    U.S. officials, however, say that releasing the report exposing Eastern European support for Abu Nidal now could be counterproductive, because despite their Abu Nidal contacts, Warsaw Pact nations have shown their first signs of joining the West's war against terrorism.    Administration officials said their quiet efforts already have prompted Yugoslavia, a non-Warsaw Pact communist country, to take action against Abu Nidal. Two years ago, Yugoslavia helped spirit Palestinian terrorist Abu Abbas, who directed the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, out of Italy.    Although they haven't gained the same assurances from the Soviet Union's six Warsaw Pact allies, an administration official points to signs of progress.    State Department counter-terrorism official Alvin Adams made a recent tour of East European countries and the administration now is exchanging information on anti-terrorist techniques, devices and specific cases with Warsaw Pact countries.    Reagan administration officials said the East Europeans are talking and acting more cooperatively, professing that they want to help fight terrorism. U.S. officials, however, said they can't yet cite any concrete help and some are skeptical that the East Europeans will do more than talk a good counter-terrorist game.    The CIA report also discusses Abu Nidal's ties to Libya, which began to grow in 1985. Intelligence sources said Libya has replaced Syria as the primary financier and supporter of the Abu Nidal group.    Among other things, U.S. intelligence officials believe Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi paid Abu Nidal to hijack an Egyptian airliner. The officials also say Col. Gadhafi provided the group with Tunisian passports and Bulgarian hand grenades used in the Rome and Vienna airport attacks, and they suspect that a well-known Libyan operative helped plan last summer's Karachi hijacking. </TEXT></DOC>
