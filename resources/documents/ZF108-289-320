 Most readers recognize DTI as a vendor of prepress systems fornewspapers, shoppers and magazines.andP;  However, DTI also has a weekly newspaperof its own in Orem, Utah, which doubles as a test bed for its ideas and itstechnology.andP;  Our visit was an interesting one since it not only gave us anopportunity to see new technology being developed, but also provided a chanceto see what is driving the technology--in this case, the vendor's ownnewspaper (and commercial) products.andM;There are several different stories we would like to tell in this issue,starting with color, which is what triggered our interest in this visit inthe first place.andP;  Next is PostScript output, considering both speed andquality attainable when producing color from a conventional, rollfedtypesetter.andM;On the nontechnical side, there are two more stories we feel are important.andO;First is the real impact of color to the customer, in this case the UtahCounty Journal newspaper.andP;  What are the real benefits this newspaper hasachieved?andP;  Second is the story of the DTI licensee arrangement--a first ofits kind, and maybe a model for future fourth-wave ventures.andM;The JournalandM;The Journal newspaper and DTI (the systems company) have common ownership:Oldham Associates.andP;  Don Oldham, president of DTI, and his relatives run boththe paper and the systems company as a family business.andP;  The Journal is thetesting ground for all the ideas and technological advancements of DTI.andP;  Thetabloid newspaper is published twice a week (Saturday and Wednesday), with acirculation of about 67,000 and a typical page count of 32 per edition, plusa lot of inserts.andP;  The best way to describe it is as a free-sheet advertiserwith news.andP;  Its news coverage is concentrated on local community activities,not international affairs.andP;  Its goal is to publish exactly what its readersare looking for, not to try to replace the daily paper, although it doesreplace it as a vehicle for typical &quot;daily newspaper&quot; advertising.andM;The 32-page product (excluding lots of inserts) is not the largest paper ofthis type, but it has been very successful in getting its share ofadvertising revenue.andP;  It attributes this to two factors: the TMC (totalmarket coverage) nature of its product (which is delivered to virtually allhomes in its region), and color.andP;  TMC has had a similar effect on othernewspapers around the country.andP;  More readers attract more advertisingdollars.andP;  There is nothing very new here.andP;  But its use of color as a tool forgaining an edge on its competition is very clear, and the result is somethingwe are just starting to see emerge.andM;Color.andP;  The Journal uses color in every conceivable way.andP;  The editorial pagesare full of large and small color photos.andP;  The advertisements are loaded withcolor--from full process color photos to colorized line art.andP;  The Journalalso has done a booming business in pre-prints (also in color) stuffed intothe weekly wrapper.andM;The ability to offer color has been a crucial advantage to the Journal.andP;  Forlocal advertising, it has meant the difference between being a contender andnot being viewed as viable.andP;  The best example of this showed up in itsautomotive section.andP;  Before color, there was no significant automotivesection.andP;  The area's large car dealerships wouldn't give the Journal the timeof day.andP;  Ad salesmen couldn't even get in the door to make their pitches.andM;Color has turned all this around.andP;  The Journal has been very successful inusing color as the vehicle to gain entry into lucrative long-term advertisingcontracts with the same car dealers who wouldn't talk to them in the past.andM;We talked to one salesman who admitted that the product now sells itself.andO;His best sales materials are his own ads.andP;  The approach now is to leave thesamples from the Journal with the dealers and wait for their reaction.andP;  Inmost cases, the samples have opened the door; business is booming.andM;This salesperson almost sounded guilty that the new selling approach wentfrom lengthy discussions in the past to simply letting the customer view thework of his production staff--an easier way to make a living.andM;But color alone--without appropriate quality--is not the answer, either.andP;  Thecompetition has tried to react with a color offering of its own, but so farit has failed to get the business back, largely because of two factors:quality and turnaround.andP;  The Journal salespeople also use samples from thecompetition to show the difference in quality.andM;The Journal also has been able to offer a faster turnaround.andP;  Much of this isattributed to its technology, which we will discuss next.andM;Color equipmentandM;The Journal is using a 24-bit Mac system for all of its color work.andP;  Thisincludes four-color editorial photos, color advertising and commercial work(printed on coated stock).andP;  Scanning is currently done on a Howtek scanner.andO;Color enhancements, separations and placement are done with a combination ofDTI's own software and a modified version of Pre-Press Technologies' colorseparation software.andP;  Output of all color pages is direct to film via aHyphen PostScript RIP and one of two recorders--an ECRM PelBox 108S or aBidco 80C.andM;For process color photos, the Journal has dedicated a couple of individualsto the color scanning and enhancement work.andP;  They have found it moreefficient for a photographer to scan all the photos to be used in the paperon the evening preceding final page make-up.andP;  A second individual (with aboutone week of specific &quot;color&quot; training) handles the separation work andenhancements.andP;  DTI's philosophy is to deal completely with the content ofeach photo (or graphic, line art element) before it is placed on a page.andM;The ad and page make-up programs (AdSpeed and PageSpeed) from DTI allow theuser to crop, size, rotate, flip and perform other operations on the graphiconce it is placed on the page.andP;  But the content of the graphic is resolvedfirst.andP;  No pixel editing or similar operations are done directly within themake-up programs.andM;Scanning.andP;  We were surprised to see how the Journal was making up theautomotive ads with color photos.andP;  Many of the used-car photos are merelysnapshots taken by salesmen and developed in a local one-hour processinghouse.andP;  The Journal uses only hard-copy reflective positives.andP;  Itexperimented with transparencies, but found the quality attained from theHowtek scanner to be less consistent and below that achievable withreflective originals, so it has standardized on reflective copy.andM;But the interesting process is getting photos of new cars into the ads.andP;  TheJournal has one of the best libraries of car catalogs we have seen.andP;  It usesthese catalogs to scan photos of cars, their interiors and whatever else theadvertisers want to capture from original brochures.andP;  Our surprise was thereasonable quality the Journal has been able to achieve, beginning withprescreened, printed color originals.andP;  The copy is scanned as continuous-toneart, letting the scanner integrate the individual pixels.andP;  Nothing is donedifferently from the procedure when scanning original contone images.andM;The scanning operator makes a judgment on scanning resolution, based on theoriginal size of the photo and what the eventual size will be.andP;  Many of thepictures scanned from the brochures are very small and will be enlarged by asmuch as 200% to 300%.andP;  These are usually scanned at about 200 to 250 samplesper inch.andP;  Photos requiring less enlargement are scanned at 150 samples perinch.andM;Speed.andP;  Scanning speeds vary greatly, depending on the scanning resolutionand the size of the original.andP;  While we were there, we timed the operation onsome 8&quot; x 8&quot; photos (usually scanned a bit larger than they will be used byeither the page make-up or the ad make-up programs).andP;  Most of the prescans wetimed were in the one-minute range.andP;  The final scans took about threeminutes.andP;  Separations took between 10 and 20 minutes per photo for very largeoriginals.andM;Much of the time was used writing the multiple files to disk.andP;  DTI attributedthis lengthy disk-writing time to the final background processing that occursas the photos are saved.andP;  This seems to make sense because the proportional&quot;read&quot; times for the same files were much faster.andP;  The operators estimatedthat the entire process--to scan, process, separate and store--the largestphotos was less than 30 minutes on average.andM;Just to give a rough idea of file sizes, we scanned a 10&quot; x 10&quot; color photoand checked the files sizes of all the component files.andP;  The original TIFFfile was 2.6 MB--large, but not unmanageable.andP;  Using the Pre-PressTechnologies software, five other files are stored.andP;  There are four files(one each for the CMYK separations), each roughly 890 KB.andP;  A fifth file,called the master file, is a composite that took up 780 KB of disk space.andO;The TIFF file is only kept on the system until the separation and enhancementof the color images are finished, so the total storage carried on diskthrough the production and make-up of the paper is about 3.5 MB for this sizephoto.andM;Pre-Press Technologies.andP;  Manipulation of the color photos using the Pre-PressTechnologies software is done on the standard TIFF file.andP;  Pre-Press hascreated an extra &quot;master&quot; file for DTI--PICT II composite screen-resolutionfile used by the ad and page make-up programs for all operations, includingcropping, sizing and rotation.andP;  This is always done with the contone images,before final screening.andP;  The final screening (rasterizing to finaltypesetter/recorder resolution) is left to the output RIP (in this case, theHyphen PostScript RIP).andM;The special version of the Pre-Press separation software that DTI uses alsocan create a composite EPS file.andP;  This is a medium-resolution version (200 to300 dpi) of the photo, used to drive a color proof printer (in this case, aTek-tronix engine).andP;  It has been very helpful for the advertising salesforce, which has found the proofing device ideal for creating spec ads.andO;These ads complement final printed samples of other work and are used to helpsell the concept of color.andM;The other variation Pre-Press has added to its separation software for DTI issomething it calls &quot;zoned UCR.&quot;andP;  This feature enables the operator to removecolor by zones.andP;  The user can specify exactly which combination of CMYK(which percentage of each color) is targeted for removal.andP;  Therefore, for aspecified percentage of CMYK, the software will automatically remove or addan operator-specified percentage of any given color.andM;The user interface is quite handy for this operation.andP;  By selecting any pointon a photo, the user can see the exact percentages of CMYK colors, thenmodify them in any way.andM;DTI color tables.andP;  As we have mentioned before, DTI uses its own color tablesto replace the one Apple supplies.andP;  These tables are tuned for DTI's ownpresses.andP;  Since the Journal has multiple presses and prints on both newsprintand coated stock, it requires a different color table for each job, dependingon what press it will run on.andP;  This gives the best possible screenrepresentation of the color that will actually be printed for each CMYKcombination.andM;Line art.andP;  The ability to handle printed photos out of brochures has greatlyenhanced the Journal's ability to capture advertising of local car dealers.andO;The use of color in the editorial pages has given a general boost to thenewspaper itself.andM;DTI's ability to &quot;colorize&quot; line art rapidly has had a similar effect oncapturing the ad make-up needs of large national advertisers and preprinthouses such as Treasure Chest.andP;  DTI recently received an order to replace alarge traditional ad make-up system at Treasure Chest.andP;  A key factor in theselection was DTI's ability to deal with color faster and more effectivelythan the current system.andP;  The current system had been upgraded to deal withcolor, but it wasn't as fast as the new DTI approach, especially when lineart was changed in size or reused in another ad.andM;DTI attributes its success in the line art area to peripheral programs thatenhance its basic application software, and to its fourth-wave philosophy,which allows simple integration of these supporting programs.andP;  This is how ithandles the problem.andM;All scanned line art is originally kept in a standard TIFF format.andP;  Thismakes it easy to include the line art files in a variety of programs.andP;  Butthe key is the conversion of these TIFF files from bitmap graphics into amore compact, vectorized format.andP;  As we will see, this extra step offerssignificant extra flexibility downstream.andM;All the scanned TIFF files are converted into a vector format via Adobe'sStreamline program.andP;  Among other advantages, this compresses the files by anaverage ratio of about 10:1.andP;  Next the files are fed directly into AldusFreeHand.andP;  DTI uses FreeHand as its &quot;clean-up&quot; tool.andP;  Any changes that haveto be made to the original artwork are done with this program.andM;We should note here that DTI needed some help from Aldus to input theStreamline files directly.andP;  The off-the-shelf Streamline format is not 100%compatible with FreeHand.andP;  But although Adobe wasn't very helpful inassisting in integrating the programs, Aldus was, and DTI now has a directStreamline-to-FreeHand program.andM;FreeHand is used also to color the graphics.andP;  Many vendors offer thiscapability, but the DTI system has one nice advantage.andP;  With other programsthat can add color to bitmap graphics, subsequent operations such as sizingand rotating graphics, once they have been colored, tend to be difficult andtime-consuming at best.andP;  With the line art in an outline vector format, thebits themselves are not individually colored.andP;  Each enclosed area has anassigned color.andP;  Therefore, as the area size or shape is changed, it istrivial to apply the color (or a new color) to the new graphic.andM;This advantage--the ability to reuse colored scanned line art in other sizeson future ads--has helped to win DTI some orders to replace traditional,high-end systems.andP;  However, DTI does not claim a significant speed advantageover competitive systems in producing color ads the first time ads arecreated.andP;  The speed advantage surfaces in the correction cycle and insubsequent ads made up with the same artwork.andM;The final step in the process is to &quot;include&quot; the colorized line art withinads and/or pages.andP;  To accomplish this, DTI outputs all files from FreeHand inan EPS format.andP;  EPS is used throughout the system for including graphics,scanned or pre-recorded, within its AdSpeed and PageSpeed products.andM;The DTI AdSpeed can also add color to objects, text and background areas.andP;  Ituses this capability extensively while making up ads and pages.andP;  But it feelsthe advantages of coloring the line art in advance in its vector formatestablish its clear philosophy: scan, clean up and color all line art as apre-process to ad or page make-up.andP;  Final sizing, rotating, chokes andspreads, and masking are all done within the make-up software.andP;  It will beinteresting to see how this philosophy holds or changes as these programsbecome even more tightly integrated within the DTI structure, as System7--and, eventually, full multitasking--come to the Mac.andM;Oracle for the databaseandM;An obvious concern of anyone dealing with a large number of scanned, createdand clip-art graphics is the database itself.andP;  For larger newspapercustomers, the answers will have to come from System Integrators (on Tandemcomputers) with the integration support from DTI.andP;  We didn't review any ofthe integration work during our visit to Orem, but we believe it hasproceeded a significant distance.andM;However, because DTI will also be selling fairly large configurations outsideof the newspaper market (commercial, retail, shoppers, etc.), real databasefacilities are important.andP;  DTI has decided to standardize on Oracle.andP;  Infact, it is already running Oracle as the database in its editorial systems,where Macs are employed by all users (writers, news editors and page make-upeditors) and PCs are used as both file servers and database managers (usuallyone for each).andM;The database for graphics isn't quite as far along as is the one foreditorial matter.andP;  Although no time frame has been given for a releasedproduct, we expect to see an Oracle database managing graphics at ANPA.andP;  Thiswill precede a full implementation of Oracle as a display ad make-updatabase.andP;  The first implementation will be purely for the management ofgraphics.andM;We got a brief look at the product before we left.andP;  It appears to be wellthought out.andP;  This is how it will work.andM;Identifying graphics.andP;  Any time someone attempts to store a graphic using thetypical Apple &quot;save&quot; command, it will be intercepted by the software and adialog box will be presented asking for complete identification of thegraphic.andP;  Via a fill-in menu, the operator will enter a graphic ID, anexpiration date, key words, categories (auto, real estate, etc.) andsubcategories (truck, car).andP;  These last two categories are supported withpop-up help menus listing all the viable options.andP;  The operator also canassign graphics to a particular job or ad.andM;This information about the graphics is sent to the database.andP;  The graphicsthemselves may be stored elsewhere.andP;  The database will retain pointersindicating where graphics are to be located.andP;  As we will see later, graphicsmay have several homes in the system.andP;  The function of the database is tohave immediate access to their location and manage their life cycle withinthe system.andM;Searches.andP;  Based on the information tagged with each graphic, an operator canperform any type of search of the database and subsequently assign thesegraphics to ads.andP;  A search list can be created for multiple graphics thatsatisfy the search criteria.andP;  Although technically the search isn't done withmultitasking, it can occur in the background while the operator continuesbuilding ads or whatever operation is currently being performed.andP;  When thesearch is complete, the operator can purge graphics, assign them to new ads,etc.andM;Utilities.andP;  A good set of utilities is also planned, primarily handling themaintenance of the database for operations such as purging and keeping trackof offline access.andP;  Although purging is a necessity and is obviously part ofthe system, DTI is basing much of its design on the philosophy that most ofthe artwork that will be used in the system will be reused at a later dateand will therefore not be deleted just because the ad it was part of hasexpired.andP;  There will be provisions to allow this type of purge to happenautomatically, but DTI feels the database management will eventually becomemore important, while scanning of new art will eventually diminish.andM;This philosophy goes hand in hand with Digital Technology's concept of addinga few steps up front in the scanning process (such as processing everythingthrough Streamline) for the eventual advantage of better flexibility inreusing most of the graphics.andM;PostScriptandM;One of the reasons we wanted to review the DTI and Journal operations was tosee how well PostScript dealt with color and deadline news.andP;  There was somegood and bad in what we found.andP;  Some of the speeds we had hoped to see hadn'tbeen achieved yet.andP;  However, we were able to see clearly where thebottlenecks were and what one vendor (DTI) is going to do to solve them.andM;The facts.andP;  We timed some pages with lots of square inches of color photos.andO;The worst case was a section front that had an 8&quot; X 10&quot; color photo, alongwith three other 2&quot; X 2&quot; photos.andP;  It is important to note that these 2&quot; X 2&quot;photos originated at 8&quot; X 10&quot; and were reduced to thumbnails for the frontpage.andP;  Therefore, the amount of data sent to the typesetter reflects four 8&quot;X 10&quot; photos.andM;This is clearly a worst-case scenario, especially since the biggest problemwe discovered in the system was transmission of the color files to the RIP.andO;Sending four color seps for four 8&quot; X 10&quot; photos on a single page reallytested the system.andP;  But it was fair because this was a live page.andM;The four separations took a total of about 54 minutes to transmit, rasterizeand record, or 13-1/2 minutes each.andP;  We should also note that there was a lotof traffic on the network during this process.andP;  But that is reality as well,during deadline production, so the test was fair game.andP;  More typical insidepages coming off the system, with fewer full-size color photos, were outputin less than half that time: about 20 minutes for all four separations.andM;We didn't time any black-and-white pages because that isn't what the Journalconcentrates on.andM;We should note that these times were recorded using the Bidco imaging engine.andO;The PelBox 108S sitting by its side would have been slightly faster.andM;The problem.andP;  It is clear where the speed problem exists (at least in thisconfiguration).andP;  The PostScript RIP is being used for only a fraction of thetotal time it took to (1) transfer, (2) rasterize and (3) image the fourcolor separations in the above test.andP;  Imaging accounted for only 4 to 5minutes of the total time.andM;The real bottleneck is the transfer of data to the RIP.andM;The Hyphen RIP used in this test currently doesn't have a direct Ethernetlink.andP;  Therefore, part of the problem is the conversion and use of the AppleLocalTalk network.andP;  All the data for a page (text, ads and graphics) is pipeddown an Ethernet cable into an Ethernet-to-LocalTalk conversion box and thendown the LocalTalk cable to the Hyphen RIP.andM;The process of taking the huge color files off their disks and passing themaround the network (which is also busy with other operations at deadlinetime) is slowing down the system dramatically.andP;  Exactly how much is hard todetermine.andP;  However, considering the time the RIP is being used, byeliminating the transmission bottleneck we should be looking at reducing thatworst-case page from 54 minutes for the four separations to about 12 minutes(roughly three minutes per page with heavy color photo content).andM;Approaches.andP;  For a long time we have felt that until the bandwidth ofnetworks was significantly increased, or other solutions such as the use ofsubstantial compression techniques were employed, the only way to solve theproblem of typesetting graphics (with or without color) was to locate thehigh-resolution graphics as close as possible to the typesetter (or,actually, to the typesetter's RIP).andP;  Most of the speed problems we have seenwith full paginated output have centered on the ability to get the graphicsto the typesetter fast enough (whether it be a PostScript or a nativelanguage device).andM;Many vendors have demonstrated full-page output for years, but the deadlinerequirements of a daily newspaper have made it difficult when their systemswere put into daily production.andP;  This is why many pagination vendors, such asHarris and Crosfield/Hastech (which once worked exclusively with externalgraphics subsystems such as Imagitex's), have opted to find a more integratedand optimum output configuration to handle the problem with output speeds.andO;It is also the reason why so many typesetter manufacturers--such as Autologicand Monotype--have turned their typesetters into the final point ofintegration: the gathering point for all elements of a page (particularly thedifficult graphic components).andM;This is precisely the function of the Autologic Graphics Integrator (AGI),which is one typesetter vendor's solution to integrating graphics quickly atdeadline speeds.andM;DTI's solution.andP;  In many respects, the DTI solution is similar in concept tothe Autologic AGI.andP;  DTI has decided to locate the high-resolution graphicsvery close to the typesetter's RIP.andP;  So close, in fact, that the graphicswill be stored directly on the disk of the Hyphen RIP.andP;  Therefore, when agraphic has to be transferred to the RIP at typesetting time, it is alreadythere.andP;  The transfer time is essentially zero.andP;  (Actually, it is the time theHyphen RIP takes to read and process the graphic off of its own internaldisk.)andM;DTI will use 600-MB SCSI drives for this storage.andP;  However, this is not theentire storage area for all graphics in the system.andP;  Other SCSI drivesconnected to the Ethernet link will be used for smaller graphics, such ascompressed line art.andP;  In addition, multiple CD-ROMs will be used to storegraphics that originate in electronic form, such as clip art libraries.andM;The 600-MB SCSI drive connected to the Hyphen RIP will be used primarily forthe larger contone and color files that create the transmission bottleneck.andO;Since this type of file typically isn't reused, this disk in effect will beused as a large buffer, purged on a weekly basis.andP;  However, DTI also uses a44-MB cartridge disk (supplied by Peripheral Land Inc.) for offline,longer-term storage.andP;  Although the Journal can afford to purge the 600-MBbuffer disk on a weekly basis, we believe larger installations might have topurge it much more frequently.andM;In addition to this large graphic storage disk (buffer disk) being connectedto the Hyphen RIP (which only reads from it), it is connected also to a&quot;primary Mac II graphic workstation.&quot;andP;  This is the only device that has bothread and write access to the disk.andM;This workstation acts as the scanning control station for all high-resolutioncolor scanning.andP;  (Other Macs in the system may be used to scanblack-and-white line art, etc., from Microtek and other scanners.)andP;  It isconnected to the Howtek color scanner via an internal GPIB board.andP;  This24-bit color device is also the primary workstation for color photomanipulation, and it creates all the color separations.andP;  In essence, it isthe primary controller of the buffer disk.andM;However, all other Macs in the system that are responsible for ad or pagemake-up also need to read from this disk.andP;  To display a color photo on thesescreens, they must have read access to the buffer disk to read the MasterPICT II file that accompanies each color photo on the disk.andP;  This is alow-(screen-) resolution version of the photo used for all ad or page make-upmanipulations such as final sizing, cropping and rotation (but not localpixel manipulation).andM;Remember, DTI's philosophy is to get the content of the picture right beforeit is manipulated on a page.andP;  This philosophy goes hand in hand with thearchitecture, which only allows these make-up stations to read the screenresolution of the photos.andP;  As we will see in a moment, cropping, sizing androtation instructions will accompany the page or ad file to the typesetter,but they don't have to be stored on the buffer disk (and therefore, thestations don't need write access to that disk).andP;  However, if other stationsdid require write access (outside of this editing make-up scenario), theycould get it via the primary control Mac (but not directly).andM;To complete the configuration of a typical DTI ad or page make-up system, weshould note that in addition to the special interfaces discussed here(control Mac tied with read/write access to a Hyphen internal SCSI drive,make-up Macs having direct read channels to this drive, and output to theHyphen RIP via an Ethernet-to-LocalTalk converter), all the Macs on thesystem are connected via a single Ethernet LAN.andP;  The database server (runningOracle) and the file server (running Novell) are on '386 PCs, also connectedvia this same LAN.andM;DTI is currently running Novell Netware 2.15 to control the network.andP;  It hasbeen working with Netware 386 and hopes to be using it shortly.andP;  However,since Novell doesn't completely support Macs in this latest version of itssoftware, DTI is forced (for now) to use the older version of Netware.andM;What makes this work.andP;  Directly off the shelf, this configuration doesn'twork.andP;  DTI has done several things to make it work.andP;  First, the 600-MB SCSIbuffer disk is connected with proprietary interface boards designed by DTI.andO;This allows up to seven Mac make-up devices to have read access to the disk,with an eighth (the primary control and color processing workstation) havingboth read and write access.andP;  This configuration is necessary to accommodatethe work flow and make-up scenario consistent with the DTI philosophy.andM;Second, the Hyphen RIP has to be upgraded to be able to read from a SCSIdrive.andP;  Currently the Hyphen RIP can only accommodate ESDI drives.andP;  Thisupgrade is not quite finished, which is why the typesetting times we measuredwere as slow as they were.andP;  During those tests, the Hyphen RIP didn't havedirect access to the high-resolution color files.andP;  All the color files had tobe passed via the Ethernet link through the LocalTalk converter, then ontothe RIP--a painfully slow path.andM;The third key to making this work is for Hyphen to honor the little-knownPostScript &quot;external file command.&quot;andP;  This command isn't commonly used inPostScript, and even our own series of tests doesn't check for PostScriptcompatibility to the extent that a deficiency here would show up.andP;  But theHyphen RIP will have to be upgraded to include it.andP;  (Hyphen tells us thatthis upgrade is now available, but it hasn't made it to Orem yet.)andM;In effect, this command tells the PostScript RIP to find an external file(one not contained within the current text string) and insert it within thepage or ad being typeset.andP;  Obviously, this file will be located on the RIP'sbuffer disk, and the content will be a color photo that won't have to movearound a slow network to get to the RIP.andP;  The RIP will have to access its owndisk to get the large color files and therefore greatly improve thetypesetting time for pages including large contone and/or color pictures.andM;Another option for calling for these large color files from the external diskis to use the OPI command set, another standard initiated by Aldus.andP;  Via theOPI commands embedded in the PostScript file, the page or ad make-upterminals can direct the PostScript RIP (Hyphen's, in this case) to fetch afile (such as a large photo) from another location and apply variousparameters to it (such as crop, size and rotate).andP;  Hyphen is contemplatingthis option to complete the project.andM;We should also point out that to make this work DTI had to write its ownintelligent PostScript driver, rather than rely on the Apple-suppliedQuickDraw version.andP;  The primary reason for this is to provide a mechanism toassemble all the graphic and text components of a page or ad at output time.andO;Since DTI only stores the text of an ad or page in its file server, alongwith pointers to all the graphic pieces that may be scattered on any numberof disks around the system, it has to gather these graphic elements toinclude them in the output file sent to the typesetter.andP;  Eventually, all butthe high-resolution picture files will be assembled in this way.andP;  Thepictures will be included directly at the typesetter as described above.andM;Output recorders and qualityandM;Another thing we were anxious to see was the ability of conventional rollfedtypesetters to deal with the quality issues of color.andP;  The big problem hereis that everyone has a different definition of quality and what is &quot;goodenough.&quot;andP;  Although we don't want to confuse readers with our own judgments,which can't be universally applied, we feel safe in saying that, in general,the color we saw at the Journal was satisfactory for most newspapers--bothfor editorial color and for advertising.andM;We believe readers could tell the difference between the newsprint color ofthe Journal (scanned and prepared on desktop components and output ontypesetters) and the newsprint color of the new sports National (scanned andrecorded on Scitex equipment).andP;  But unless they were side-by-side comparisons(which isn't the way most people read newspapers), we doubt that typicalreaders would ordinarily be conscious of the differences.andP;  We say that basedon the fact that most of the color produced by the Journal using the DTIequipment is far better than what is commonly produced by newspapers aroundthe U.S., using whatever equipment they have.andM;In cases we saw in which the quality wasn't generally good, there wereidentifiable reasons for the shortcoming that didn't reflect the inability ofthis technology to handle the task.andP;  However, since the Journal (for bothcommercial and newspaper work) is outputting solely on 1,000-dpi recorders,there is an identifiable limitation in the combination of perceived grayscales and screen resolution.andM;That doesn't mean that all equipment and processing scenarios are equal.andP;  Onthe recorder side, DTI has both an ECRM PelBox 108S and a Bidco 80C.andP;  Someinteresting issues surfaced with this side-by-side combination.andP;  The tworecorders are being driven by the same Hyphen RIP.andP;  This has been made easyby the PelBox emulation interface recently introduced by Bidco.andP;  It is nowpossible to drive the Bidco recorders directly, as if they were PelBoxes.andM;The two units are now completely plug compatible.andP;  In fact, the Journal hasbeen using them both; one is usually dressed with film and the other with RCpaper.andP;  The comment made to us was that we have finally achieved the ultimatein &quot;commodity recorders.&quot;andP;  The Journal was using one to back up theother--not a bad accomplishment from two primary competitors, and a situationcompletely independent of the front end.andM;This should not be looked at as a comparison between the ECRM and Bidcocompanies or product lines, since they both offer other products that counterthe advantages or disadvantages revealed here.andP;  But our testing on site and,more importantly, the conversations we had with the production staff at theJournal did point out differences in the two units that were being used bythe Journal.andM;The ECRM PelBox.andP;  The primary difference pointed out by the Journal wasrepeatable registration between color separations.andP;  The ECRM unit had beeninstalled for some time and has been producing acceptable results.andP;  Theresults have been good enough to the extent that the Journal has been usingit for full-color work in both the newspaper and some commercial jobs.andP;  Butthe registration can vary slightly from one separation to the next--not by ahuge amount, but both in the registration targets and especially inreverse-type areas, the registration isn't perfect.andP;  To compensate for theslight differences in separations, more time is spent in stripping tominimize the differences from one separation to another.andP;  Separations areshifted slightly, reducing the error between them.andM;Of course, ECRM has developed a higher-quality machine (the 3,048-dpi PelBox3000) that is more appropriate for color work.andM;Bidco's 80C.andP;  The Bidco recorder arrived shortly before we did.andP;  Right out ofthe box the unit appeared to be perfect: dead on in the registration test.andO;The next roll of film produced less than perfect results and led to someconcern.andP;  The problem was identified in the film width being used.andP;  When thestaff properly dressed the machine with 14&quot; film, the perfect registrationreturned.andP;  The lesson: if you are running color off these Bidco devices, youcan't expect good results from narrow-measure film.andP;  The film should be thefull width of the typesetter.andM;We were only on site for a couple of days--not long enough to give the unit arigorous test for consistency.andP;  But we called back to the Journal later andwere told that for more than a week, the registration was still dead on.andO;This development really pleased the production staff because it cut the extrastripping time that had been required with the 108S at the criticalhour--deadline.andM;It also added support for using the Bidco machine for higher-qualitycommercial work to be printed on a new press recently installed.andP;  The stafffeels that the new unit with UV driers, running on coated stock, wouldproduce a bit better quality than had been obtained previously, andspeculated that the Bidco unit was clearly adequate.andM;The bottom line (from this test, at this site) appears to be twofold.andP;  First,the Bidco 80C is holding registration between color separations a bit betterthan the 108S can, but the 108S is still good enough for the newspaper work.andO;Second, for most of its commercial work, the Journal feels that the Bidcooutput is adequate.andM;We should note here that Autologic, which sells both the Bidco engine and the108S, has opted to modify the 108S and use it as its primary output enginefor color.andP;  It will continue to sell both vendors' products forblack-and-white applications.andP;  We are not sure why Autologic made thisdecision, but it is possible that it favored the 108S for its wider measure(which is more appropriate for Autologic's largest market--newspapers).andP;  Infact, this is probably the reason Autologic hasn't gone to ECRM's 3,000-dpimachine, which was specifically designed for color.andP;  Furthermore, Bidco hassince introduced a large-measure unit.andM;Film width.andP;  Another interesting factor that came out of this testing is theissue of film width.andP;  Both the PelBox and the Bidco unit can run narrowpaper.andP;  However, both companies recommend full-width film for the addedregistration accuracy needed in color work.andP;  This was obvious in the Bidcounit as it went from accurate registration to a level about equal to thePelBox, in one roll change, before the Journal realized the recorder neededfull-width film to produce quality output.andP;  Although the PelBox likes to runwith full-width film also, the Journal didn't see quite the same variationsbetween full-and narrow-width film.andP;  The full-width film isn't able to bringthe registration quite up to the top level.andM;The Journal is now eager to try a larger-format Bidco unit.andP;  The 80-picamachine is actually better for its newspaper work.andP;  Being a tabloid paper, itreduces film cost when running full width.andP;  But for commercial jobs, a coupleof extra picas would support running pages four up and simplifying the task.andO;The 80-pica unit is just a hair too narrow.andM;Licensee arrangementsandM;Another interesting aspect to the DTI visit was a discussion of its ratherunique licensee arrangement.andP;  There are seven members of the group.andP;  Thisincludes DTI itself, System Integrators (selling in North America tonewspapers with circulations above 30,000 daily, as well as in Germany,France and Italy), DPS Typecraft (selling in the UK and South Africa),Tele-Ekonomi (in Scandinavia), Expograph (in Benelux), Pongrass (in Australiaand New Zealand), and a newcomer, ICC (in Spain).andM;On the surface, this looks like a distribution network for DTI.andP;  But it isthat and much more.andP;  In addition to sales organizations, all of thesecompanies are system developers as well.andP;  All can bring some technology tothe party.andP;  The members have the rights to peripheral programs and productsthat enhance the DTI system.andM;The group was established simply to license the DTI technology.andP;  But sinceall the parties felt a need to customize the product for their ownrequirements, all needed and got the source code (and all its updates).andM;The second objective the group serves is to join together in marketing deals.andO;For example, it acquired the complete license to the Proximity handamp;j algorithms(for all languages), which everyone can use.andP;  As a group, it has the rightsto sell the Hyphen RIP/typesetter.andP;  It has also developed and procured a 21&quot;portrait gray-scale monitor from Sigma Designs.andP;  The group has exclusiverights to this product, the first tabloid-size gray-scale monitor for theMac.andP;  None of the members of the group would individually be financiallyready to make this type of move.andM;The group also has used its size to acquire a group runtime license forOracle.andM;The third way in which the group operates jointly is in development projects.andO;Just beginning to emerge, this route involves development work that is tiedto DTI products.andP;  It becomes available to the rest of the group.andP;  Examples ofthis are the Pongrass classified pagination product (paginating DTIclassified ads), the DPS imaging system, and the Tele-Ekonomi photo wirereceiver that will debut in the U.S.andP;  shortly.andM;Finally, the group cooperates in regional shows to help cut the cost ofexhibiting.andP;  This local presence in various countries helps the othercompanies show their products independently, while leaning on the localsupplier for logistical support.andP;  For example, at ANPA this year, all themembers of the group will be present--but all under separate banners.andM;The group meets on a regular basis to discuss how the members can aid eachother to enhance their products.andP;  This is more than a tacit joining together.andO;The group actively meets and works together to achieve common goals and thegeneral betterment of their common product: DTI systems.andP;  It sounds as if DTImay be the real beneficiary here--but actually, so are the others.andM;ConclusionsandM;It is always difficult to generalize when it comes to quality, especially incolor printing.andP;  But that is what we are always asked: Are some of thesedesktop components, complemented with professional, dedicated software,capable of producing acceptable output on rollfed typesetters?andM;Obviously, the final decision of what is adequate for each customer needs tobe made by each customer.andP;  But if we were asked to comment on the relevanceto the newspaper market of these new systems and color capabilities, we wouldsay that for many newspapers, the quality demonstrated by DTI is acceptable.andO;This doesn't mean we shouldn't strive for better quality.andP;  In fact, we haveseen a comparable situation regarding text composition for many years.andP;  Thenewspaper standard is lower than the standard in other segments of themarket.andP;  We strive for improvements there also, but in the meantime, werealize that price and ease of use are very relevant factors in some markets.andO;It may be worth sacrificing a certain amount of quality to bring color to thenewspaper when top-quality systems are unaffordable to many papers.andP;  This isclearly the case with the Journal.andM;Of course, the use of color for many newspapers won't have the same positiveeffect it has had for the Journal.andP;  But, then, you may not know unless youtry.andP;  The good part about this is that experimenting with color today is alot less costly than it used to be.andM;Is PostScript fast enough?andP;  Again, a universal answer is inappropriate.andP;  Forthe large metros looking for &quot;page a minute&quot; output for everything, using theconventional two or three units, and piping all the data down a single cable,the answer is that PostScript isn't fast enough today (and neither may beconventional languages).andP;  Yes, it is true that PostScript requires more datathan conventional languages and therefore requires greater processing power,but the problems associated with full-page make-up--and therefore full-pageoutput--are still system problems, such as getting high-resolution graphicfiles (let alone multiple-color files) to the RIP at deadline.andM;So we can continue to try to poke holes in PostScript and run tests thatfollow our previous ideas of how to output full pages with graphics.andP;  We maynever get there--native language or PostScript.andP;  But we are approaching a newera (no, not the fifth wave) where the way in which we configure our outputdevices will be more important, along with related issues such as where RIPsare located, how many RIPs we needs (is ten that bad if they are simplyanother software package running in our front-end system?), and how we aregoing to solve the real problem of getting large graphic files to the RIP atdeadline.andM;DTI appears to be close to a solution for this, using the Hyphen RIP.andO;Autologic is also close with its AGI.andP;  We expect to see some much fasterAdobe RIPs at Drupa in April.andP;  Other typesetter manufacturers have similarsolutions on the drawing boards.andP;  But in most cases, the final result willlikely involve PostScript, since most of the graphic files these days haveone thing in common: PostScript output formats.andP;  ANPA will be an interestingtime to view typesetter output as a system issue, not simply an output box.andM;Lastly, we would like to compliment DTI and its licensees.andP;  As we havestruggled through difficult times where &quot;cats and dogs&quot; arguments prevailedover cooperation, we saw very little progress toward real integration.andP;  Thisnew licensee arrangement has been a very positive step for one group ofdistributors and developers to share their developments and hopefullyaccelerate the process of integration.andP;  And, by the way, the customers havebeen the real beneficiaries.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
