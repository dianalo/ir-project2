Regarded by many as the only otherfirst-tier candidate in the race, Mr. Kerrey should havebroken out this week, but didn't. The fundamental reason, asthe candidate himself suggests, is that Mr. Kerrey has yet toestablish himself as a credible alternative.   &quot;We really have not done the work of letting people knowwho I am,&quot; he acknowledges in an interview.   So far, Mr. Kerrey appears to have gained nothing from theClinton upheaval. Clinton poll ratings did swoon initially,then stabilized in the mid to upper 20s. But the big gainerwas candidate Paul Tsongas, who surged into the same range.Mr. Kerrey remains static at best, hovering around a littlemore than 10%. To some professional observers, the Nebraskasenator has actually lost ground. Even some Kerrey insidersare gloomy about their candidate's prospects.   As of today, says Jerry Chervinsky, who conducts polls forthe Boston Globe, &quot;Kerrey is nowhere.&quot;   Yet the strategic opening still exists. The Clintoncandidacy still seems vulnerable. Nobody else has taken off,with the possible exception of Mr. Tsongas, and mostpolitical experts still doubt his staying power. A majorityof New Hampshire's Democrats remain undecided or soft; ifhistory is any guide, their vote won't break until the finaldays of the campaign. Mr. Devine notes that at this point in1984, Gary Hart stood at well under 10% in the polls, yetsurged in the final days to beat Walter Mondale handily. Hepredicts a similar late surge for Mr. Kerrey, fueled in partby powerful new ads detailing the candidate's Vietnam heroismand recuperation.   A turnaround could occur if the candidate finallyestablishes his identity. But that was supposed to be theleast of Bob Kerrey's problems. He entered the race as arecipient of the Medal of Honor. He was a complex andintriguing figure who had moved Nebraska audiences to tears,a man of action who could also quote Camus.   But Bob Kerrey was also a political rookie -- he has beenin only two campaigns in his life -- and he jumped into thepresidential race without much preparation. &quot;I didn'testimate very clearly the difficulty of saying in 15 minuteswhat I want to do as president,&quot; he concedes now. As forCamus, he adds wryly, &quot;It's the Camus factor that confusespeople. Sometimes it confuses me.&quot;   But something more than the Camus factor seems to be atwork here. At bottom, the reflexive instincts of Bob Kerreythe individual seem out of sync with the needs of Bob Kerreythe candidate.   Athough Mr. Kerrey is certainly capable of giving arousing speech, an innate reserve often inhibits him fromdoing so. His low-key speeches can disappoint even voterswho, like Holly Zurer of Portsmouth, badly want to be sold.   &quot;I think he's smart enough to be president,&quot; Ms. Zurerconcluded after making a special effort to listen to Mr.Kerrey a second time. &quot;I'm not sure he's smart enough to getelected president.&quot;   Similarly, Mr. Kerrey's gut reactions can make for someerratic campaign statements. Mr. Kerrey's first publicreaction to the allegations about Mr. Clinton was to urgeaudiences to &quot;send a message&quot; to America that sensationaljournalism has no place in a presidential campaign. With somedifficulty, Kerrey strategists talked him into dropping thatline, pointing out that voters could send such a message onlyby voting for Mr. Clinton.   Then, on Wednesday, Mr. Kerrey abruptly changed course,blasting Mr. Clinton for &quot;insensitive&quot; remarks about New YorkGov. Mario Cuomo on the very tape recordings originally citedby the tabloid newspaper. Mr. Clinton by then had alreadyapologized to Gov. Cuomo, but Mr. Kerrey said the &quot;extremelyweak apology&quot; gave him &quot;serious doubts about the nature ofthe candidate himself.&quot;   More important, Mr. Kerrey lately has taken flak forshifts on substantive issues, notably for making aprotectionist-sounding ad despite a Senate voting record thattilts toward free trade. He argues that he remains a freetrader and is simply calling attention to a trade war theJapanese already have launched. Despite criticism that he hasbecome a Johnny one-note on health care, he's sticking withthat issue, in fact making it a central theme of hiscampaign.   As it nears its crucial New Hampshire test, the Kerreycampaign increasingly portrays him as a fighter. The newemphasis, likely to show up in tonight's candidate debate onpublic television, ties into his war record.   The idea, says communications director Mike McCurry, isnot only to focus the message but to link it in a verypersonal way to Mr. Kerrey's extraordinary life story. Thehope is that Mr. Kerrey will be seen as a man &quot;who will go tothe mat for you and fight for you in a personal way.&quot;   At his best, as in a speech here the other night, Mr.Kerrey makes the &quot;fight&quot; theme work. He struck a chord inthis recession-ravaged state by evoking his own recovery fromamputation of his lower right leg. &quot;I do know what it's liketo be flat on your back, feeling bitterness and betrayal,having to put your life back together,&quot; he said. He thenpledged to fight as hard as president as he did in Vietnam --to &quot;fight to save lives&quot; with his national health-insuranceplan, to &quot;fight a right-wing Supreme Court that seemsdetermined to take away every single freedom we have.&quot;   Kerrey supporters believe the new approach has time towork. &quot;We're just coming to the point where people startmaking up their minds,&quot; says Jeanne Shaheen, a state Senatorand architect of Gary Hart's stunning 1984 victory here.   Neutral observers say the jury is still out. &quot;My sense isthat this race is still very fluid,&quot; says Ned Helms, aDemocrat who's running for governor. &quot;There's now arecognition in New Hampshire that Bob Kerrey is a verydifferent kind of candidate. How that will translate, I don'tknow.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
