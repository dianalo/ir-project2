Infinancial markets, the Fed's move was seen as an abruptresponse to the dismal numbers on jobs.   But in fact, officials say, the discount-rate cut had beenin the works for days. The reason: the Fed's concern aboutthe slow growth of money and credit.</LP><TEXT>   While war rages in the Persian Gulf, the &quot;credit crunch&quot;has become Public Enemy No. 1 here at home. The TreasuryDepartment and the Federal Reserve -- which both pooh-poohedtalk of a credit crunch early last year -- are now devotingmuch of their energy to combating it. So are the other bankregulatory agencies.   Even President Bush joined the fight last week. &quot;Soundbanks should be making more sound loans, now,&quot; the presidentsaid in his State of the Union address. &quot;And interest ratesshould be lower, now.&quot;   Already, officials in Washington have taken a series ofunusual steps to try to get banks to lend again. In additionto cutting interest rates, for instance, the Federal Reservelate last year eliminated a requirement that banks holdreserves equal to 3% of their corporate certificates ofdeposits -- the first change in reserve requirements since1983.   More changes are clearly in the works. The Fed, thecomptroller of the currency and the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. are working together to devise changes in bankregulation to encourage lending.   And the Fed is even tentatively considering changes in theway it operates its &quot;discount&quot; window, which makes loans tofinancial institutions. Currently, banks are reluctant toborrow at the discount window for fear of appearing to be infinancial trouble. But the Fed is understood to be quietlystudying ways to remove that stigma and to encourage morediscount-window borrowing. With the discount rate at 6% --below the 6.25% rate which banks pay to borrow money fromother banks -- such a change could provide a modest boost tosome banks' profits.   Will any of these changes ease the credit crunch? That'sfar from clear. To date, the government's efforts to getbanks to lend seem to have come to naught.   &quot;I don't think lower interest rates will induce bankers tolend more,&quot; says Thomas Theobold, chairman of ContinentalBank Corp. When a large loan, say for $300 million, comesalong now, Mr. Theobold adds, &quot;Our ability to organize aglobal syndicate is poorer today than a year ago.&quot; Heexplains that when other banks are approached, &quot;A typicalreaction is they don't want more assets or they are nowlending only in their own areas. A lot of different filtersare applied.&quot;   And Richard Boyle, vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp.,says even a change in discount-window practices &quot;would be abold move, and certainly a significant stimulus in thecreation of money,&quot; but he doubts even that would have mucheffect on the credit crunch.   Some bankers, including Mr. Boyle, say the most effectivesolution to their problems would be for regulators to ease upon new standards requiring them to raise bank capital. &quot;Itwould be more realistic to lower the level of capital or topush back the date for full implementation&quot; of the newrequirements, he says.   Thomas Hanley, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, agrees.&quot;Regulators have got to relax the capital standards,&quot; hesays.   But government officials say that isn't about to happen.High levels of capital provide an important source of fundsthat can be used to pay off depositors if a bank's loans gosour, they argue. Without that capital cushion, the taxpayersmay get left holding the bag. The reason the savings and loanbailout is so costly to the taxpayer, officials say, isbecause many Sandamp;Ls had virtually no capital at all.   &quot;Capital is the first line of defense in bank regulation,&quot;says John Robson, deputy secretary of the Treasury.   But even without changes in capital standards,Washington's increased focus on credit problems is likely tobegin to have an effect. The discount-rate cut &quot;is the mostimportant shift in regulatory attitude in months,&quot; says JamesMcDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods. He says itmust be &quot;viewed as part of a continuum, along with loweringreserve requirements and looking at new accounting treatmentfor problem loans. None of these steps individually answerthe credit crunch problem. But collectively they should inthe not-too-distant future.&quot;   Credit growth, of course, often slows during recessions ashard-hit consumers and businesses cut back their borrowing.But Washington is worried that now credit is beingconstrained by an unusual unwillingness among bankers tolend. Many banks, especially in New England, have sufferedlarge losses on real-estate loans and are reluctant to makenew ones.   Moreover, bank regulators, wanting to avoid anothersavings-and-loan debacle, have stepped up pressure on banksto increase their capital and their reserves against badloans. And many bankers have concluded that the easiest wayto raise capital as a percentage of their total loans is tomake fewer loans.   &quot;In this uncertain world, made more uncertain by war andeconomic slack, some bankers at the top have lost their nerveand ordered a retreat from their basic business -- lendingmoney,&quot; Fed Governor John LaWare said recently.   Administration officials argue that cutting interest ratesis the most effective way to counter the credit crunch. &quot;Oneway to get {loan} demand going again is to get lower interestrates,&quot; Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson said recently.The annual report of the President's Council of EconomicAdvisers, due out next week, also argues that traditionaleasing by the Fed can largely offset the credit crunch.   The Fed remains cautious in cutting rates; it is anxiousnot to seem to be abandoning the fight against inflation.Moreover, some bank analysts say interest rates alone won'tdo the trick. If banks aren't willing to lend, they say, theFed's actions amount to &quot;pushing on a string.&quot; Lower rateswill bolster bank profits, says Mr. Hanley at SalomonBrothers, &quot;but banks will remain cautious.&quot;   Bank regulators in Washington, stunned by allegations ofoverzealous regulation, are taking a second look at theirpractices to see whether they can't help ease the creditproblem. &quot;We bank regulators want to make sure that we arenot the cause of the credit crunch,&quot; FDIC Chairman WilliamSeidman told Congress last week, &quot;and that we haven'tover-reacted to the experiences we've had in the past.&quot;   The regulators are looking at a number of accounting andother refinements that should help bankers. None of them aredramatic, but over time they could reduce the fear anduncertainty that seem to have curbed banks' desire to lend.   One of the more significant measures that regulators arestudying is called &quot;loan splitting.&quot; This would change themethod of accounting for loans -- primarily commercialreal-estate loans -- on which the borrower has enough cash tomake some of the required interest payments but not the fullamount due.   Under current rules, the entire amount of such a loan mustbe counted as &quot;nonperforming.&quot; The loan-splitting proposalwould allow a bank to split the loan into two pieces -- onegood loan, on which payments are still being made, and onebad loan, on which payments have stopped. Only the bad loanwould have to be counted as nonperforming -- thus reducingthe bank's need to increase its loan-loss reserves.   That would be a major change in bank regulatory practices.Mr. Hanley of Salomon Brothers says the proposal couldincrease by 8% the annual profits of the nation's 35 largestbanks. Citicorp, he figures, would be the biggestbeneficiary, getting an earnings gain of 27%. Peter Manning,chief financial officer of Bank of Boston, says the changecould &quot;break the neck of the credit crunch&quot; by eliminatingexcessive caution among bankers.   But others are more skeptical. &quot;We do not believe thatbanks' provisions for possible loan losses will decline as aresult of these altered accounting techniques,&quot; three bankanalysts at First Boston Corp. wrote in a recent report.&quot;Every bank we have discussed this with agrees with thisconclusion.&quot;   Moreover, critics worry that such regulatory changes smellof the kind of lax accounting that got the thrifts intotrouble. Charles Peabody, a bank analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp;Co., calls the loan-splitting proposal a &quot;cosmetic accountingBand-Aid&quot; that &quot;shows that forbearance is creeping back intothe system.&quot;   The Treasury's proposal for restructuring the bankingsystem, due out soon, will highlight the need for banks tomaintain strong capital. Under the plan, low capital willtrigger increased regulatory attention at a bank, while highcapital will be required for banks that want to become partof a new class of financial-services holding companiesoffering expanded services.   Although reports of a credit crunch can be heardthroughout the nation, the problem remains most acute in NewEngland. That makes the task of Washington policymakersespecially difficult. Policies such as lower interest ratescan address national problems, but they can't help as muchwith regional ones.   In response to that problem, FDIC Chairman Seidman islooking at ways to support temporarily weak banks that needassistance to get through tough times. On Friday, members ofthe New England congressional delegation asked TreasurySecretary Brady to meet with them to discuss ways to helpbanks in their region, &quot;including different procedures toinfuse capital into viable depository institutions.&quot;   ---   Kenneth H.
