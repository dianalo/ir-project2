The telecommunications concern said the quarterly loss stemmed from restructuring charges and weaker-than-expected revenue. As expected, there was a pre-tax charge of $584.9 million related to equipment write-downs and a previously announced cost-cutting program.    The charges were partially offset by a $39.1 million pre-tax gain from the settlement of MCI's antitrust lawsuit against American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., the regional companies that were part of the Bell System and other independent phone companies.    MCI said quarterly revenue climbed 28% to $920.1 million from $721.4 million a year earlier. However, Bert C. Roberts Jr., president and chief operating officer, called the revenue &quot;disappointing&quot; because the company had hoped for a much bigger increase. He blamed what he called the &quot;uncertainty created by frequent predictions of additional ATandamp;T rate reductions during 1987&quot; and a declining revenue base at MCI's Satellite Business Systems unit for the performance.    As for this year, &quot;it's going to be difficult,&quot; said William E. Conway Jr., MCI's chief financial officer. &quot;Our performance will depend on how successful we are in growing top-line (revenue) dollars.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI closed at $6.125, unchanged.    &quot;This is an omen of things to come,&quot; said Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;MCI's basic problem is that it's caught in the squeeze of ATandamp;T's lower rates and US Sprint's aggressiveness.&quot; US Sprint Communications Co. is a joint venture between GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn., and United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo.    Many on Wall Street had expected MCI's fourth-quarter revenue to grow at least 4% from the third quarter's, to $950 million; instead, it grew only 1%. Mr. Grubman said MCI will need more commercial customers to improve its outlook.    Of the 300,000 new customers the company signed up in the fourth quarter, 250,000 were classified as residential. Typically, such sales have lower profit margins for phone companies because those customers make most of their phone calls during evening hours, at lower rates.    MCI also has been hurt by higher access charges it pays to connect its network to local phone companies. For the year, those charges amounted to about 46% of revenue, compared with 34% in 1985.    Though Mr. Roberts said he considers the access charges, which are set by the Federal Communications Commission, to be &quot;inequitable,&quot; he remains optimistic about the company's long-term prospects. He said the restructuring plan, along with a $4 billion investment over the past four years in improved communications equipment, will enable MCI to deliver &quot;optimum quality and service at a lower level of capital expenditures&quot; than it could before.    Mr. Conway said MCI has introduced several products to attract more business customers, including a toll-free calling service and a reduced-rate long-distance system, similar to ATandamp;T's WATS service.    Excluding the restructuring charge and the settlements, MCI said it had a pre-tax operating loss of $30.6 million for the quarter. Officials declined to provide an after-tax amount for the operating loss. But analysts put the number at $26 million to $27.5 million, based on a corporate income-tax rate of about 10% to 15%.    In the 1985 quarter, MCI earned $8.3 million, or four cents a share, after accounting for a $26.3 million charge on extinguishment of debt.    MCI's Mr. Conway said the company has a &quot;significant&quot; amount of uncollectible revenues, but he declined to quantify it. The main culprits, he said, are customers who won't pay their bills and callers who make fraudulent use of other customers' long-distance account numbers.    For the year, MCI posted a loss of $448.4 million on revenue of $3.59 billion. The loss included the restructuring costs. Gains from an asset sale and from the settlement of lawsuits against other phone companies partially offset the loss.    In 1985, the company had operating profit of $139.6 million, or 59 cents a share, on revenue of $2.54 billion. A $26.3 million charge for extinguishment of debt made 1985 net income $113.3 million, or 48 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
