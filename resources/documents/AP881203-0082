The public space-to-ground radio link was kept silent while thefive military men went about their business on the second day of themission, which began with Friday's launch and is under the controlof the Air Force.   NASA said in advance it would break the silence only if majorproblems developed aboard the spacecraft.   By all accounts, Saturday was to have been the crew's busiestday, with the expected release of the $500 million Lacrossesatellite, but the only official word on the mission came from NASA,which released the menu: salmon, ham, macaroni and cheese and turkeytetrazzini.   Sources have said the satellite is capable of recording sharpimages of military targets in the East Bloc. Weighing 18 tons andwith a solar panel wingspan of 150 feet, the satellite, according tosources, will help verify Soviet compliance with arms treaties andserve as a ``radar eye'' for the stealth bomber.   The Soviet news agency Tass' apparently knows plenty about thesatellite, reporting many details about it, including the code nameLacrosse.   Atlantis' secret mission began with a spectacular public blastofffrom Cape Canaveral, Fla., during a momentary calm in fierce,upper-level winds similar to those that halted the launch onThursday.   Four hours after the shuttle blazed across the clear sky on anorthward course, Mission Control broke the silence, saying: ``Thecrew of Atlantis is go for orbit operations.''   That announcement meant that the spaceship's cargo bay doors wereopen and the task of preparing the satellite for deployment couldbegin.   Only military men are aboard Atlantis, serving under Navy Cmdr.Robert L. Gibson, the commander. The pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. GuyS. Gardner, and the mission specialists are Col. Richard M. Mullaneand Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. WilliamM. Shepherd.   According to pre-flight reports, Mullane was to be inside theshuttle cabin using the orbiter's robot arm to hoist the satelliteout of the cargo bay and release it when Atlantis was in a preciselocation and position.   The procedure was so intricate that Shepherd and Ross were to bein space-walking suits, prepared to go into the cargo bay if anyproblems arose in releasing the satellite. Normally, astronauts donot suit up for satellite launches.   Once Lacrosse is in orbit 240 miles high, Gibson and Gardner thenwere to fly alongside the satellite until ground controllers werecertain it was working properly.   The satellite's course reportedly will often take it over theSoviet Union and Eastern Europe, where it can observe militaryoperations through darkness and cloud cover.   The crew also planned to conduct several experiments aimed atdefining the role of military observers in space, with reconnaisancea high priority, according to sources who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   It is believed the astronauts will test a special optical deviceresembling hand-held binoculars.   The tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercisesthat could include troop maneuvers, naval movements or ballisticmissile launches.   The flight, the second since the Challenger disaster, the 27thshuttle mission overall and the third dedicated to the military, isexpected to end Monday or Tuesday with the landing at Edwards AirForce Base in California.   NASA and the Air Force plan to give 24-hour notice of the landing.</TEXT></DOC>
