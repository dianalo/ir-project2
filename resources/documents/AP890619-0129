Bush is suggesting the superpowers for the first time startverification, or monitoring compliance, before they finishnegotiating a treaty.   A quick breakthrough appears unlikely in the talks begun underformer President Ronald Reagan, since both sides have indicated nochanges of position on major outstanding issues.   Moscow and Washington sent new delegation leaders to Geneva forthe 11th round of talks since March 1985 on a Strategic ArmsReductions Treaty and defense and space issues.   Richard Burt, a military expert and former U.S. ambassador toWest Germany, replaced veteran negotiator Max Kampelman after theseven-month pause. Yuri Nazarkin, chief Soviet delegate to the40-nation Conference on Disarmament, succeeded Alexei Obukhov. Thetalks will last six to seven weeks, Burt said.   In Washington, Bush said verification ``may be the most complex''issue facing negotiators.Bush proposed the two sides make a specialeffort ``to agree on and begin implementing as soon as possible''verification measures.   He said this ``will speed resolution of outstanding issues.''   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the steps could includevisits to each other's missile sites.   Burt received Nazarkin for a one-hour, 20-minute opening sessionat the U.S. Mission. It was the second time they met.   Afterward, Burt said he outlined ``President Bush's overallapproach to arms control, emphasizing the president's commitment toreducing the risk of nuclear war.''   Nazarkin spoke of ``a good start'' and also held out the prospectof unspecified Soviet initiatives.   ``As the round progresses, we will use our ideas and put them onthe table,'' he told reporters.   In detailed negotiations starting Wednesday with a full meetingof both delegations, Burt will lead the U.S. team and Lem Masterkovwill continue as Soviet negotiator under Nazarkin.   Delegates are expected first to review the many agreed points inthe 400-page draft pact.   Talks were delayed by the Bush administration's review ofnational security policy during the Reagan presidency.   A new proposal Bush's advisers are drafting calls for on-sitetest inspections in both countries to monitor cuts of long-rangeballistic missiles already in the draft treaty, according to U.S.officials. A Pentagon official said Bush wants to take advantage ofthe new Soviet openness.   But neither side has hinted at movement in disputes over thePentagon's space-based ``Star Wars'' missile defense, sea-launchedcruise missiles and mobile land-based missiles.   The Soviets say the U.S. missile shield violates the 1972superpower Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   Disputes have developed over Moscow's demand for includingsea-based cruise missiles under the treaty and Washington's call fora ban on mobile missiles.   Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,has predicted ``protracted and agonizing'' negotiations.   The superpowers have agreed to much of a draft treaty to cutlong-range, or strategic, nuclear forces by 30 percent to 50 percent.   The treaty is intended to cover nuclear weapons with which thesuperpowers can strike each other, including those considered mostdangerous _ sea- and land-based ballistic missiles and heavy bombers.   Already agreed at earlier rounds are lowered ceilings of 6,000nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles and bombers_ for each side.
