Although the company didn't make any specific revenueprojections, it applauded new rules adopted last month by theCoordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, orCocom. The committee, formed to control the transfer ofsensitive technologies to the Soviet Union and its allies,includes member nations of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization, plus Australia and Japan.</LP><TEXT>   The political changes sweeping Eastern Europe led toeasing of the restrictions.   &quot;We are clearly seeing a recognition by the U.S.government and its Cocom allies that it no longer makes senseto restrict the flow of modern information technology tocountries that desperately need it to modernize&quot; and buildmarket-oriented economies, said Lee Mercer, Digital'scorporate export manager. He said that Digital, based inMaynard, Mass., also was satisfied that Cocom had addressedindustry concerns about the licensing of software,particularly software for computer networks.   For the more powerful computers requiring individuallicenses, the Commerce Department will still screen proposedbuyers to ensure that the machines aren't used for missilecontrol, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons production.Computer makers themselves will be responsible for ensuringcivilian use for the smaller systems decontrolled under thenew rules, which become effective Sept. 1.   Other computer companies have been more reserved in theirreaction to the new rules. An International Business MachinesCorp. spokesman said the company was pleased with thedecision &quot;but we're not convinced it goes far enough.&quot; Headded that until the rules are fleshed out in formalregulations, &quot;it's difficult to tell whether it'll have muchimpact on our business.&quot;   The Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers'Association said it had questions about how the rules will beimplemented, calling it a &quot;mixed bag.&quot; But the industry groupsaid the relaxed rules should boost revenue for U.S. computermakers in the region.   Digital said the new rules will allow East Europeancustomers to buy substantially more powerful models thanpermitted under current rules, including Digital's largestminicomputers, without special U.S. export licenses. Digitalinterpreted the new rules to mean that it also will be ableto sell even more-powerful models, up to its Vax 9000mainframe and fastest technical workstations, as long as themachines are solely for civilian use.   &quot;It is clear that Cocom intends to decontrol all softwarethat is sold via mass-market channels,&quot; Mr. Mercer said.Local networks, such as those linking personal computers inan office or university, also have been decontrolled, whilesales of larger wide-area networks to Czechoslovakia, Hungaryand Poland will require a two to three-week review. Wide areanetwork sales to China and the Soviet Union still will besubject to more stringent reviews, but would carry apresumption for approval if solely for civilian use.   Separately, a Digital spokesman said a new unit in Hungaryhas topped expectations and its payroll has doubled to 80people. He wouldn't disclose the unit's sales, however. Theyprobably were still small for Digital, which had totalrevenue of $12.9 billion in the year ended last June 30,including $5.2 billion in Europe. The spokesman also said theavailability of hard currency for payment hasn't proved asserious a problem as had been feared.   Digital's largest European market is Germany, whereWest-East unification has helped sales, the spokesman said.Digital also recently opened a subsidiary in Czechoslovakia.   Digital's computer design has been widely copied in theEastern bloc because of the company's traditional strength inscientific and industrial applications. Indeed, in somemarkets Digital has joined forces with companies that alreadyhad been selling machines based on unauthorized copies ofDigital's Vax and PDP-11 computer designs.</TEXT></DOC>
