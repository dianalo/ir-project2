But Singh has his sights on a larger kingdom.   The 58-year-old politician has emerged as Prime Minister RajivGandhi's main challenger in next month's general election and asthe rallying point of hopes to replace the government that hasdominated India for most of its 42 years of independence.   Singh is attempting to galvanize a coalition of oppositionparties that span the ideological spectrum, from Communists toright-wing ethnic parties, to oust the man he once called hisfriend.   But the groups, collectively known as the National Front, areplagued by highly publicized feuds and have little in common excepttheir opposition to Gandhi and his Congress Party.   A month ago a unified opposition seemed possible as Hinduactivists joined ardent Communists in mass demonstrations againstthe government. But recent outbreaks of Hindu-Moslem violencearound India have led the Communists and some centrists to questionthe viability of a broad opposition alliance.   It is hard to predict how, if at all, India's social, economicand foreign policies would change if power switched from a Congressto an opposition government in voting Nov. 22, 24 and 26.   The National Front's platform, apart from accusing the Gandhigovernment of tolerating corruption, makes no radical departuresfrom the goals outlined by Congress Party governments. Both sidesspeak of easing poverty and strife in this ethnically andlinguistically diverse country of 880 million people.   Except for accusing the government of corruption, Singh hasvoiced few opinions.   Political analysts say Singh changes his ideological color sooften and with such deftness that it has become almost impossibleto put him in a definite category.   He has been nicknamed the ``Mr. Clean'' of Indian politics. Buthe also has been called a fraud and villified by numerous people,including former allies in the top ranks of the government.   ``V.P. Singh is a cobra. He was fed on the milk of the CongressParty and now he is injecting poison into the Congress Party,''said a Congress Party leader, Kalpnath Rai. ``He should be hangedfor treachery.''   Singh, a balding, bespectacled man with a Charlie Chaplin-likemustache, is aware of the importance of image but opposespersonality politics.   ``I have always taken the stand that we have to shift frompersonal appeal to issues,'' he said. ``This is the way a democracymatures and it's the issues which are agitating the peoples'minds.''   ``The biggest issue is the feeling that the people have beentremendously let down by the present regime and there is rampantcorruption at the top,'' he said.   When Singh was 5, his biological father, the Rajah (king) ofDaiya gave him to the Rajah of Manda, who was childless. He grew upin one of the most palatial outposts in Uttar Pradesh state and wasthe sole heir to the estate when his adoptive father died six yearslater.   Not allowed to see real family for years, the shy young Singhturned to poetry and painting.   Prime Minister Indira Gandhi outlawed royal titles in the early1970s, but people in Manda still call Singh the rajah.   While in college, Singh became interested in politics andeventually joined the Congress Party. In 1974, Mrs. Gandhi namedhim a deputy minister of commerce and two years later promoted himto minister of state for commerce. He served there until Mrs.Gandhi was ousted in the 1977 parliamentary election that installedIndia's only non-Congress government since the country gainedindependence from Britain in 1947.   When she was brought back to power after the oppositiongovernment disintegrated in 1979, Singh was inducted into herCabinet as commerce minister.   After Mrs. Gandhi's assassination in 1984, her son succeeded herand picked Singh as one of the ``whiz kids'' who would lead theworld's most populous democracy into the 21st century. Singh becamea champion of political morality, a campaign for which he wassacked as finance minister and defense minister and then expelledfrom the Congress Party two years later.   Although he made a great show of renouncing political office, hewas embraced by the opposition, former Congress Party members whobitterly opposed Mrs. Gandhi and later her son. Today, theopposition, at least for the moment, has accepted Singh as itsleader. His protestions about shunning positions of power have beenset aside.   The opposition's battle cry has been a controversial Indiangovernment contract to buy $1.4 billion worth of artillery from theSwedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. Indian newspapers have allegedthat Bofors paid middlemen up to $50 million in kickbacks to securethe 1986 contract.   The deal was negotiated by the prime ministers of the twocountries and was supposed to be free of commissions and agents'fees.   No one has been charged with any crime, but the scandal hastarnished Gandhi's image. Many statements issued by the governmentin Parliament have been proved wrong by documents uncovered by TheHindu and other newspapers.   The scandal, which has faded and flared intermittently, waspropelled back to the front pages recently, spurring Gandhi to callelections nearly two months before the Jan. 14, 1990 deadline.   Most analysts say the average Indian voter has been numbed bycharges of high-level corruption and is more concerned aboutunemployment and rising prices.   ``I am not saying that corruption is a new thing or that therewas no corruption before Rajiv Gandhi's time,'' Singh said. ``Bigmoney always has been close to politics.   ``But there was a difference. The moneybags might have fundedpolitics, but they could not influence decisions. Politicians werelike charioteers and big money was the horse pulling the chariot.Now Rajiv Gandhi has become the horse and big business has climbedinto the charioteer's seat.''</TEXT></DOC>
