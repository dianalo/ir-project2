The maker of pickup truck-bed liners and other auto partsposted a $17.1 million, or $2.78-a-share, net loss for 1989.Those results included non-recurring charges totaling $19.3million, or $3.13 a share.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Laro, in an interview, declined to give first-quarterearnings figures. But Mr. Laro did say that, because of acost-reduction program Durakon began last year and otherpositive developments, the company expects to perform betterthis year. For the 1989 first quarter, Durakon had a net lossof $1.1 million, on sales of $22.3 million.   Durakon was awarded a contract in early March to supplythree General Motors Corp. assembly plants with pickuptruck-bed liners. GM will market the liners under Durakon'sDuraliner brand and sell them as factory-installed options.GM is the first Big Three auto maker to offer Durakon'struck-bed liners, which typically are sold and installed bydealers, as factory-installed equipment. Truck-bed liners,made of polymer, are used to protect the metal frame of avehicle and help to inhibit rusting.   The contract &quot;will give us a place in the market that isstronger than ever,&quot; said Mr. Laro, who declined to estimatethe increase in sales the contract will bring.   But Mr. Laro did say that, as a result of the GM contract,he expects the percentage of all new pickup trucks purchasedwith truck-bed liners to increase to about 50% from about 32%now. &quot;We will get the lion's share of that business, he said.The new GM work prompted analysts to raise their forecasts ofDurakon's earnings for 1990 to $1 or more a share, from about80 cents.   Durakon wants to strike agreements similar to its GMrelationship with other auto makers. Last year, Durakonbecame a supplier to Nissan Motor Co's. plant in Smyrna,Tenn., which now is the only auto maker besides GM to offerDurakon truck-bed liners as a factory option.   Mr. Laro said that as a result of efficiencies gained fromnew automated equipment and the upgrading of otherinstruments, the company will not have to hire additionalpersonnel to handle the expected order increase. Durakonspent $4 million to improve its factories.   The agreement with GM comes as Durakon nears completion ofits cost-cutting program begun a year ago. Since then,Durakon has changed management, sold some operations anddiscontinued others. Mr. Laro became chief executive in March1989. The company also cut its payroll by 8% to 941 people.   Durakon wrote down $15 million of goodwill in connectionwith its 1987 purchase of DFM Corp. The company also wrotedown by $3.8 million a patent held by its Jerr-Dan Corp.subsidiary. Both those actions took effect in the fourthquarter.   Mr. Laro said Durakon has renegotiated contracts with itssuppliers that will save costs. Durakon plans to announcefurther cost-cutting measures in the second quarter. Durakonalso sold two unprofitable business lines: a sailboatmanufacturer and its trucking business.   Meanwhile officials decided to keep the company's Jerr-Dandivision, which makes roll-back car carriers, which areflat-bedded trailers used by big trucks to haul automobiles.Last year Durakon agreed to sell the division, but the dealfell through when the buyer was unable to obtain financing,Mr. Laro said. Now Durakon intends to keep Jerr-Dan, whichplans to unveil a new product next month. &quot;There'ssubstantial value to our shareholders in keeping Jerr-Dan,&quot;Mr. Laro said.</TEXT></DOC>
