(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Calls for a ban on private ownership ofsemiautomatic military weapons in California have risen strikinglysince one was used in Stockton in a schoolyard attack that killedfive children.   The state attorney general and several lawmakers hope to passlegislation while Californians are still stunned by the killings andthe wounding of 29 other children and a teacher last week by a manfiring an AK-47 assault rifle.   ``These kinds of weapons are available to anyone who wants to buythem,'' said Attorney General John Van de Kamp. ``All one needs is awarm smile and cold cash. This is madness and this has to stop. Wehave to ban these weapons from going in the streets of our city andstate.''   Senate leader David Roberti urged Californians to ``write, talk,call on talk radio, call their legislators, demand, scream,pressure, intimidate'' in favor of a ban.   At the request of San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, the U.S.Conference of Mayors may take up a resolution calling for a ban onparamilitary weapons such as the Soviet-designed AK-47. Agnoshimself was wounded by a gunman in one of San Francisco's infamousZebra attacks 15 years ago.   The group agreed to have a subcommittee consider the resolutionin February, said Agnos' press secretary, Eileen Maloney. Theresolution would only be advisory in nature.   ``If urban mayors and police chiefs across the country unitebehind a grass-roots demand that sale of assault weapons be halted,I am convinced we can make our voices heard in the nation'sstatehouses and the halls of Congress,'' Agnos said.   The efforts are being met with vigorous opposition by staunchpro-gun advocates such as H.L. Richardson, a national director ofthe National Rifle Association and founder of Gun Owners ofCalifornia.   ``The real question is how a nut like that with his backgroundcan be walking around on the street. Why don't we go after thecriminal for a change?'' Richardson said of the Stockton gunman,drifter Patrick Purdy, who killed himself after the assault on theschoolyard.   Purdy had both a criminal record and a history of mentalproblems. He bought the AK-47 at a gun shop in Sandy, Ore., inAugust. All he had to do was fill out a form and pay for it. Nowaiting period was required.   Purdy could have bought the rifle in California as well. Underthe law, law, anyone 18 years old or older with a driver's licensecan purchase a rifle. There is no waiting period and nothingpreventing felons or those with a history of mental problems frombuying rifles.   Richardson said he owns a semiautomatic weapon. ``I use it forhunting turkey in Texas,'' he said. ``It is also a very good varmintfirearm. Very accurate.''   Gov. George Deukmejian, asked if he would support a ban on theweapons if passed by the Legislature, said he would first ``want toreview the whole issue very carefully.''   ``But I, just for the life of me, cannot see why anybody who isgoing to use a gun just for sporting purposes would want or need tohave a military assault type weapon,'' he added.   Deukmejian said he would support a requirement that rifle andshotgun buyers wait 15 days for a background check before obtainingone of the weapons. The state currently has such a delay on the saleof handguns.   ``I don't think that anybody who has got a known record in termsof criminal activity or somebody who has had mental problems _ Idon't have any problem with preventing those individuals fromgetting possession of any gun,'' Deukmejian said.   The attorney general's proposed legislation will offer adefinition of a semiautomatic assault weapon and specify somebrands, all of which would be banned, said Dick Iglehart, AlamedaCounty's chief assistant district attorney and a member of a taskforce created by Van de Kamp to address the problem.   But Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said he was ``not terriblyoptimistic'' that lawmakers will do anything about gun control.   ``Every day that we move away from the Stockton-type incident,the legislative will to do something in that area will be reduced,''Brown said.</TEXT></DOC>
