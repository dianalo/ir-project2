In recent years, chromatography data handling and datareduction systems have improved dramatically, leading to greater precisionand shorter analysis times. This situation increases sample load in manylaboratories which are understaffed at the onset. Progress in automationof sample preparation in the past has generally been limited to automaticinjectors. Robotics is ideal for automating sample preparation procedureswhich tend to vary depending on the analyte, interferences, and matrix.This paper describes fully automated HPLC and gc using the Zymate LaboratoryAutomation System. A generic approach will be illustrated which can beapplied to both major component and trace analyses. Major component analysismay include such options as solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquidextraction. Concentration and reconstitution are a few of the optionsavailable in trace analysis. Specific applications in the chemical, pharmaceutical,food and petrochemical industries will be given. Data to support automatedpreparation over manual methods will be presented for HPLC.</TEXT></DOC>
