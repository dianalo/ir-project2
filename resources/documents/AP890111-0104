The figure is included in President Reagan's proposed budget butCongress actually draws up its own spending proposal.   It is normal for Congress to about double its mailing costs inelection years, even though campaign materials cannot be sent withtaxpayer money.   For fiscal 1989, Congress has budgeted $60.9 million, accordingto budget documents. In the election year of 1988, however,congressional mailings cost $113.3 million, a figure highlighted ina report on congressional perks by consumer advocate Ralph Nader.   Nader opposes Reagan's recommendation that members of Congressreceive $135,000 in annual pay instead of the current $89,500.   The raise will become law unless both houses of Congress defeatthe plan by Feb. 8, and House leaders are dropping hints they haveno plans to schedule a vote by then.   In addition to having taxpayers pay for their official mail,lawmakers receive ``orange bag'' service from the Postal Service,ensuring one-day delivery.   Other fringe benefits are less costly, but provide the 535members of Congress a life without some of the hassles that faceordinary citizens.   Parking, for instance.   Special tags permit lawmakers to use any curbside in the Districtof Columbia except along fire hydrants, fire stations or loadingdocks.   At National and Dulles airports, members can use special lotsnext to the terminals.   Lawmakers can stay fit by using using the gym in the RayburnHouse Office Building and exercise rooms in the Russell and DirksenSenate office buildings. Facilities include a swimming pool,handball, volleyball and basketball courts and a steam room.   Should a member become ill at work, or need an immunization orallergy shot, he or she can go to the Attending Physicians Servicein the Capitol. It is staffed with doctors, nurses and technicians,and includes such services as a medical response team, an ambulance,laboratory, X-ray and pharmacy services. Free medical testing isavailable at the Senate Health Club.   Members can participate in federal employee health insuranceprograms, and life insurance of $78,000 is provided, with taxpayerspicking up half the cost and members paying for the other half.   Lawmakers have approved tax deductions for many groups ofAmericans, and have included a special one for themselves: adeduction of $3,000 per year for living expenses while away fromtheir congressional districts or home states.   If a lawmaker discusses legislative business with anyone who isnot a staffer or a fellow member of Congress, he can be reimbursedfor the cost of food and beverage.   While lawmakers can't depend on job security, those who stayawhile can live comfortably on their pensions.   Some former members have received over $1 million in pensionbenefits, and dozens of others are approaching the million-dollarmark, according to Nader's report.   Lawmakers can invest up to 10 percent of their base pay in a 401(k) pension plan _ a program available to many Americans, in whichno tax is paid until money is withdrawn.   But for members of Congress, taxpayers match the first 5 percentof salary, a contribution that currently is worth $4,475 a year permember. If the pay raise goes through, the taxpayer share wouldtotal $6,750.   Covered by Social Security and _ if they choose, the CivilService retirement programs _ members can receive pension benefitsat age 50 after 20 years of service or age 60 after 10 years ofservice.   Reports filed by congressional committees and other reports showtravel expenditures of $6.7 million during the 1987 calendar year,money that comes from the State Department budget.</TEXT></DOC>
