Jack Mendelsohn is deputy director of theArms Control Association in Washington. A former career senior Foreign Serviceofficer, he served on the U.S. negotiating teams for the SALT II and STARTtreaties.

Bersia is a member of the Orlando Sentinel editorial board.  </MEMO><TEXT>     A No. There are a lot of things left on the agenda: deeper reductions instrategic and conventional forces, the question of tactical nuclear weapons inEurope and elsewhere, the need for a multinational accord on chemical weaponsand constraints on arms transfers. The Soviets have a big interest in navalarms control. Also, we still haven't put to rest limits on nuclear testing,anti-satellite weapons, restraining &quot;star wars&quot; and preserving theanti-ballistic missile treaty.;    Q Why then is there no evidence of nextsteps by the Bush administration?;    A You still have to put into force lastyear's treaty on conventional forces and the START treaty, and that won'thappen until they go through Senate hearings and ratification. So it's notsurprising that there's an arms control hiatus. Ratification could take untilearly next year, at which point the Bush administration is likely to be closeto entering the election-year mode. Then everything will come to astandstill.;    Q So when can we realistically expect renewed attention toarms control?;    A By 1993, we'll be back in a &quot;what's new?&quot; mode. And we'lllikely see arms control come up on the screen quite strongly once more. Thatwill be as a result of economic pressures, strategic, political and militarydisengagement with the Soviets and popular pressure for reductions in militaryforces. Interestingly enough, if current trends continue, arms control mightturn out to be a salvation for the military. That's because it could presentfloors for forces, rather than ceilings, which would be useful for them inworking out their budgets.;    Q How much of an interest do you believe theSoviets have in further arms control?;    A If the Soviets continue to try toreform their economy, and if they continue to be interested in political andmilitary disengagement, they're likely to look to reductions in the militaryburden for some time. The area where they could make the largest savings is inconventional forces. Even after the new treaty on conventional forces is inplace, the Soviets will have the largest military establishment in Europe.Moscow also has an interest in pursuing naval arms control and in assuring thepreservation of the ABM treaty. They've also been seeking for some time acessation of nuclear testing.;    Q What incentive is there for the UnitedStates to continue pursuing arms control?;    A First of all, budgetary. Thenthere's an increasing skepticism in the population as to the requirements forlarge military forces when your principal adversary is collapsing ordisintegrating. As well, there's a recognition that there are still very highlevels of forces, in a world that has been totally transformed since 1989.;   Q Which weapons deserve first consideration?;    A Almost certainly, there'llbe a major reduction of U.S. troops in Europe -- two-thirds or more. All ofthe countries of Europe are planning major troop reductions. The Germans, forexample, are going down from 665,000 (from the former West and East Germanforces) to 370,000 by 1994. We may be interested in trying to bring Soviettroops down in a formal way.;    Q What should be the fate of remainingnuclear weapons in Europe?;    A Together with the Soviet withdrawal fromCentral Europe and reduction in the Soviet conventional threat, tacticalnuclear weapons seem increasingly anachronistic. As a result, we can expecttotal Soviet withdrawal of nuclear weapons to within their borders and theelimination of U.S. tactical nukes on land -- artillery shells and Lancemissiles. The justification for tactical nuclear weapons has been eliminatedby the equalization of conventional forces in Europe, and the U.S. policy,restated in conjunction with the Persian Gulf War, not to use nuclear weaponsagainst states that don't possess them.;    Q How much more can thesuperpowers afford to cut back their strategic nuclear weapons?;    A At leastin the range of 3,000 to 5,000 actual warheads on each side. In other words,another 50 percent cut beyond START. That would amount to about half thenumber of weapons deployed under the treaty.;    Q Should future arms treatiesinclude non-superpowers with nuclear weapons, like Britain and France?;    AIf you get down below 5,000 for the superpowers, there will likely be a strongdrive from the Soviet Union to include third-country nuclear forces in thesettlement. Nuclear weapons are so massively destructive that we're still along way from coming down to levels where third-country weapons really make astrategic difference.;    Q In sum, START helps us move in that direction?;   A Yes. Political, economic and public pressures are likely to build in thenear future to continue the arms control process, as a benefit of reducedtensions and to cut spending. START and the conventional forces treaty are notthe end of arms control so much as they are putting into place frameworkswithin which further reductions in weapons can be made.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOHN C.
