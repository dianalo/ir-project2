While United would only say the total value of the airplanes, including spare parts and engines, is more than $2 billion, individuals familiar with the transaction have said the order could be valued at about $2.67 billion. Seattle-based Boeing Co. valued the firm order alone at more than $1.3 billion.    The order was confirmed at the annual meeting of United's parent, which began as Allegis Corp. but by the end of the meeting was UAL Corp. It follows by a day an announcement that American Airlines ordered 50 Boeing 757s and took options on 50 more. The United order indicates the intentions of Chairman Stephen M. Wolf both to modernize the carrier's aging fleet and boost its slow growth rate.    Mr. Wolf said after the annual meeting he expects United's capacity to grow 8% to 9% in 1989, when the first of the new planes would be delivered. This year, the carrier is expected to grow at a rate of 2.5%, well below the industry average.    The airline said the first 757 would be delivered in August 1989, followed by five others in that year, 21 in 1990 and three in 1991. It said option deliveries will be determined later, depending on the airline's ability to produce consistent earnings.    In addition to the 757 order, United has taken delivery of 22 out of 110 737-300s and will begin taking deliveries of 15 747-400s in 1989. Mr. Wolf indicated the company would like even more 757s, but said &quot;the primary growth restraint facing United today is our cost structure.&quot;    Although he didn't say so directly, the statement reflected the view of United officials that the company's earnings performance and ability to grow depends largely on whether it can get significant cost savings in a contract currently being negotiated with its pilots' union.    The airline said it plans to finance part of the 757 order through the sale of its fleet of 29 McDonnell Douglas DC-8-71 aircraft to GPA Group Ltd., of Shannon, Ireland.    United wouldn't give details of either transaction, but said the initial 757s would be leased through one or more financial institutions.    The order brings to 528 the number of Boeing jetliners purchased by United. The Chicago-based airline is Boeing's largest customer. The aircraft will seat 192 passengers, and will be powered by Pratt andamp; Whitney PW2000 engines.    The transaction had been anticipated by industry observers, and comes on the heels of the order by American, a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp. That order has a potential value of more than $4 billion. Earlier this month, Boeing sold 100 aircraft and options for 20 additional aircraft, valued at about $4.6 billion, to International Lease Finance Corp., a Beverly Hills, Calif., aircraft leasing firm.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boeing shares closed at $53.50, down 12.5 cents, and Allegis shares closed at $81, down 25 cents.    The slew of orders for the 757 will help boost the once-lagging production of the aircraft. Boeing, the aerospace giant, designed the 757 with two engines and a two-person crew cabin as an economical replacement for the aging Boeing 727, which has three engines and a three-person crew. But low fuel costs had encouraged airlines to hold on to their 727s, and orders for the newer craft had been slow in coming.    Shareholders at the Allegis annual meeting approved a change in the name of the company to UAL Corp., reflecting the fact that the travel concept that the Allegis name was supposed to imply ended with the sale of the company's hotel and rental car units.    At a news conference after the annual meeting, Mr. Wolf said an institutional investment firm has surpassed Coniston Partners as the company's largest shareholder. Although they wouldn't identify the firm, company officials described it as a passive and friendly investor. A spokesman said the firm's stake is greater than the current 7.9% holding of Coniston, a New York-based investment partnership that was instrumental in getting Allegis to restructure last year. </TEXT></DOC>
