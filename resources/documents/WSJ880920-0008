Reacting to a letter from the Hafts, the giant grocer swiftly reaffirmed its desire to proceed with the $3.8 billion defensive restructuring it unveiled last week after initial feelers from the Haft-controlled Dart Group Corp. The exchange sets the stage for what may become one of 1988's biggest takeover battles.    In the letter, Dart Chairman Herbert H. Haft proposed to acquire Kroger for $55 a share -- $43 a share in cash plus securities with an intended trading value of about $12 a share. &quot;All terms, including price, are negotiable,&quot; Mr. Haft said in the letter, &quot;and we are confident that together we can determine an appropriate, proportionate ownership of the combined companies.&quot;    Kroger, based in Cincinnati, currently operates 1,300 supermarkets, 900 convenience stores and 15 warehouses in 29 states. Mr. Haft said in the letter that a Kroger-Dart combination would give Kroger shareholders &quot;greater value per share&quot; than the Kroger restructuring, while allowing holders &quot;to maintain an equity interest in a more diverse, growth company.&quot;    Mr. Haft, as he has done in other takeover situations, also asked to meet with Kroger executives to pursue the unlikely possibility of a friendly acquisition. &quot;The resources provided by Dart Group should allow (Kroger) management to share in the equity of the combined companies in a meaningful and more significant manner,&quot; he said.    The news of the offer pushed up the price of Kroger shares. In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Kroger closed at $52.625, up $1.625.    Dart Group Class A shares closed at $85 bid in over-the-counter trading.    Neither Kroger nor the Hafts would elaborate on the Haft bid. But Kroger is expected to strongly resist this and any further Haft overtures. At least initially, Wall Street analysts and arbitragers don't look for the big grocer to alter its previously announced restructuring strategy unless the Hafts resort to launching a tender offer, which would allow Kroger holders to sell their shares directly to the Hafts. While difficult to finance -- the Hafts declined comment on any financing for their Kroger bid -- such an offer could ultimately push Kroger into the hands of a friendly acquirer, the fate of several recent Haft targets.    Kroger is the sixth major retailer or grocery chain the Hafts have launched bids for in the last three years. If those fights were any indication, Kroger has a long battle ahead that could end its independence. Four of the Hafts' five previous targets were snapped up by leveraged buy-out concerns; a fifth, Dayton Hudson Corp. was saved only when the Hafts were forced to sell their shares in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock-market crash.    Three of the Hafts' targets were snapped up in acquisitions totaling $11.6 billion by the leveraged buy-out concern of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Wall Street investment bankers have joked that KKR should pay the Hafts a commission for bringing in new business.    On its face, several analysts suggested the Haft's $55-a-share cash-and-securities bid roughly equals the Kroger restructuring, which traders have valued at between $53 a share and $58 a share. Kroger's proposed restructuring, which the company's board is scheduled to act on by month's end, involves a $40-a-share cash payout to shareholders and a junior subordinated debenture intended to have a trading value of about $8 a share. The value of both the Kroger and Haft proposals is subjective because they include securities.    &quot;By making this bid, the Hafts are arguing, and probably rightly so, that Kroger is worth more than its restructuring, which we value at $53 a share. We agree {with the Hafts},&quot; said Robert Raiff, an analyst with Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. in New York. &quot;Would a $55 offer prevail over a $53 restructuring. Yes.&quot;    Linda Morris, an analyst at Provident National Bank in Philadelphia, values the Kroger restructuring at $54 a share to $55 a share and suggests Kroger won't be able to sweeten that substantially. The proposed restructuring would saddle an already highly leveraged Kroger with even steeper debt levels. &quot;It would be difficult for Kroger to counter with a higher offer,&quot; she said. &quot;They would need help from a white knight.&quot;    The Hafts' string of five straight unsuccessful takeover attempts have gained them a reputation as savvy spotters of value in the retailing and grocery industries. The Kroger bid climaxes a busy year for the family that began when it prodded Stop andamp; Shop Cos. into a $1.2 billion friendly acquisition. It followed by asking the federal government for permission to accumulate stake in a pair of retailers, F.W. Woolworth andamp; Co. and Zayre Corp. Neither action produced a bid for either company.    ---   Constance Mitchell in Pittsburgh contributed to this article.    ---                        Dart's Targets   Feb. 1985 -- May Department Stores. The Hafts buy a small stake in the retailer, which they later sell.   May 1985 -- Jack Eckerd. The Hafts' Dart Group Corp. buys a 5% stake in this drugstore chain. A month later Jack Eckerd buys it back.   Nov. 1985 -- Beatrice. Dart makes a last-minute $5.9 billion bid for the company, but loses to a $6.2 billion leveraged buy-out proposal from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   June 1986 -- Safeway Stores. Dart offers $3.9 billion for the company, but is beaten by a $4.2 billion LBO arranged by KKR.   March 1987 -- Supermarkets General. Dart offers $1.7 billion for the company, which escapes by going private in a $1.8 billion LBO arranged by Merrill Lynch.   Sept. 1987 -- Dayton Hudson. Dart accumulates 4.6 million shares and bids $6.3 billion for the rest. But the retailer resists, and the October stock market crash halves the value of the Hafts' holdings. The shares are sold for a $67 million loss.   Jan. 1988 -- Stop and Shop. Dart puts the supermarket chain in play with its tender offer, but KKR aranges a $1.23 billion LBO.   April 1988 -- F.W. Woolworth. The retailer discloses that a partnership led by Dart Chairman Herbert Haft filed for federal clearance to purchase up to 15% of its 64.3 million shares outstanding.   Aug. 1988 -- Zayre. The retailer says a partnership led by Mr. Haft advised the company of plans to buy at least a $15 million stake in Zayre. No purchases have been disclosed. In September, Zayre agrees to sell its discount stores division to Ames Department Stores Inc. for $800 million.   Sept. 1988 -- Kroger. The Haft family wins federal clearance to accumulate a stake in the retailer. Kroger counters with a restructuring proposal analysts value at $53 to $55 a share. Dart offers to buy Kroger for $55 a share in cash and securities, or $4.36 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
