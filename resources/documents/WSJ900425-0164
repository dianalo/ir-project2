In a signal that it's having a tough time selling theproperty, the thrift bailout agency said in a meetingyesterday that it may slash prices below appraised valuesmore than originally planned. Its real-estate portfolio mayeventually total as much as $100 billion.</LP><TEXT>   RTC Chairman William Seidman compared the proposed policyto a department store markdown, calling it the &quot;Filene'sbasement plan.&quot; Under the plan, if a property doesn't sellafter six months, the RTC could reduce the price to 15% belowthe price set by private appraisers. After three more monthswithout a sale, the price could be reduced 5% more. Afterthat time, the property would be reappraised. For residentialproperty, the first markdown could occur after four months.   &quot;It's costing us every day because we are not making thesales that we could be making,&quot; said Mr. Seidman. The RTC hastaken control of about $16.4 billion in foreclosed realestate, but it has sold only about $2 billion of that sincethe agency was created in August.   The board delayed for two weeks any decision after RobertClarke, comptroller of the currency, said he was concernedthat the policy could hurt other real-estate prices. Theagency will re-examine the proposal during that time.   The RTC said the proposed policy wouldn't violate aprovision in the savings-and-loan restructuring law thatrestricts the RTC from selling real estate below 95% of themarket value in depressed areas. The agency argues thatmarket value shouldn't be set exclusively by appraisers, butby what price attracts buyers.   The RTC may also consider how to guarantee loans for someprivate borrowers to finance purchases of RTC real estate,said David Cooke, executive director of the agency.   Separately, the RTC tapped Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.,a Greenwich, Conn., investment banking specialist that dealsin asset-backed securities and mortgages, to act as itsadviser in setting policies for securitizing mortgages andloans held by the RTC thrifts. In addition to the $250,000policy contract, Greenwich will launch a pilot project tobundle some RTC assets to be sold in blocks. The amount ofthat contract will depend on the extent of the assets in thesecuritization program.</TEXT></DOC>
