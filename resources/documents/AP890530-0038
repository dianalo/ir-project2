The alliance reaffirms its position that for the forseeablefuture there is no alternative to the alliance's strategy for theprevention of war, which is a strategy of deterrence based upon anappropriate mix of adequate and effective nuclear and conventionalforces which will continue to be kept up to date where necessary.Where nuclear forces are concerned, land-, sea-, and air-basedsystems, including ground-based missiles, in the presentcircumstances and as far as can be foreseen will be needed inEurope.   In view of the huge superiority of the Warsaw Pact in terms ofshort-range nuclear missiles, the alliance calls upon the SovietUnion to reduce unilaterally its short-range missile systems to thecurrent levels within the integrated military structure.   The alliance reaffirms that at the negotiations on conventionalstability it pursues the objectives of:   _The establishment of a secure and stable balance ofconventional forces at lower levels;   _The elimination of disparities prejudicial to stability andsecurity; and   _The elimination as a matter of high priority of the capabilityfor launching surprise attack and for initiating large-scaleoffensive action.   In keeping with its arms control objectives formulated inReykjavik in 1987 and reaffirmed in Brussels in 1988, the alliancestates that one of its highest priorities in negotiations with theEast is reaching an agreement on conventional force reductionswhich would achieve the objectives above.   In this spirit, the allies will make every effort, as evidencedby the outcome of the May 1989 summit, to bring negotiations to anearly and satisfactory conclusion. The United States has expressedthe hope that this could be achieved within six to 12 months. Onceimplementation of such an agreement is under way, the UnitedStates, in consultation with the allies concerned, is prepared toenter into negotiations to achieve a partial reduction of Americanand Soviet land-based nuclear missiles forces of shorter range toequal and verifiable levels. With special reference to the Westernproposals on CFE tabled in Vienna, enhanced by the proposals by theUnited Sates at the May 1989 summit, the allies concerned proceedon the understanding that negotiated reductions leading to a levelbelow the existing level of their SNF missiles will not be carriedout until the results of these negotiations have been implemented.Reductions of the Warsaw Pact SNF systems should be carried outbefore that date.   As regards the sub-strategic nuclear forces of the members ofthe integrated military structure, their level and characteristicsmust be such that they can perform their deterrent role in acredible way across the required spectrum of ranges, taking intoaccount the threat _ both conventional and nuclear _ with which thealliance is faced. The question of Lance will be dealt with in 1992in the light of overall security developments. While a decision fornational authorities, the allies concerned recognize the value ofthe continued funding by the United States of research anddevelopment of a follow-on for the existing short-range missiles,in order to preserve their options in this respect.</TEXT></DOC>
