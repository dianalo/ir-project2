 By addingnew functions, bumping up performance, and enhancing connectivity,networking, and interoperability, the System/390 is aimed directly atspecifically stated requirements of IBM customers and at the increasingintegration of information systems into customers' business systems and theirstrategies for competitiveness.andM;Highlights of the System/390 announcement include:andM;-    Enterprise System/9000 (ES/9000) family of processors--andM;a single line of air- and water-cooled processors, 18andM;models in allandM;-    Enterprise Systems Architecture/390, (ESA/390),andM;specifically designed for the System/390 environment,andM;including:andM;-    Enterprise Systems Connection ArchitectureandM;(ESCON)--with fiber-optic channels and a range ofandM;new products said to enhance systems planning andandM;implementation flexibility, as well as provide forandM;less disruptive dynamic configuration changeandM;-    IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture, with newandM;levels of system, network, and workstationandM;securityandM;-    A new architecture providing data spaces for theandM;VM environmentandM;-    MVS/ESA, VM/ESA, VSE/ESA--Enterprise SystemsandM;Architecture throughout a family of new operatingandM;systemsandM;-    3172 Interconnect Controller and VTAM enhancementsandM;for improved LAN integration and management,andM;including links to remote systemsandM;-    New releases of DB2 and SQL/DS, providing the nextandM;step for SAA distributed data to allow access toandM;data whenever and wherever neededandM;-    IBM SystemView--designed to enhance the managementandM;of systems and defining a structure for systemsandM;management productsandM;-    Other functions, features, and applications forandM;the System/390 environmentandM;Enterprise System/9000andM;IBM calls the single System/390 family of processors the ES/9000.andM;This new family is upward-compatible with System/370 systems and offersadditional functions and new architecture support through ESA/390.andM;The ES/9000 family covers a broad performance range and reportedly offersover a hundredfold growth path for commercial applications and overtwo-hundred-fold for scientific applications, from the smallest to thelargest model of the line.andM;There are 18 models in the family, 10 air-cooled and eight water-cooled.andP;  Allmodels support a common architecture, ESA/390, and many of the features andfunctions are common throughout the line, such as:andM;-    ESCON channels, to deliver the new input/output (I/O)andM;architecture and fiber-optic medium--increasedandM;distances, higher data rates, and less cable weight andandM;bulkandM;-    Integrated Cryptographic Feature for water-cooledandM;models, to implement a common architecture and deliverandM;performance an order of magnitude greater than currentandM;capabilityandM;-    PR/SM, which is standard on all models and allowsandM;multiple logical systems images--such as production,andM;development, and test--to run concurrently on a singleandM;systemandM;-    Improvements in scientific and technical computing,andM;made throughout the family, that include theandM;introduction of vector capability on some air-cooledandM;modelsandM;The ES/9000 processor family offers many upgrade options from existingsystems.andM;Enterprise Systems Connection ArchitectureandM;The Systems/390 announcements include the first major IBM advance in channelarchitecture since the System/360, the Enterprise Systems ConnectionArchitecture (ESCON), which is implemented through fiber-optic technology,and a range of products and services, creating new opportunities whileremoving constraints.andP;  The technology enables substantially greater distancesto be supported for channel attachments, allowing campus installations forprocessors, and I/O devices.andP;  Fiber-optic links also provide a largereduction in weight and bulk and increased flexibility when compared totoday's copper cables.andM;IBM says it is building a &quot;comprehensive new environment for connectivity,&quot;consisting of new software, hardware, and connecting devices, as well asenhancements to existing products.andM;For example, IBM introduced the new IBM ESCON Director, which gives theability to dynamically switch channel-to-control-unit (or channel-to-channel)connections among several paths.andP;  IBM is also offering a service to helpimplement this new architecture and its components.andM;ESA/390 Family Of Operating SystemsandM;Together with the ES/9000 processor family, IBM introduced a common family ofoperating systems.andP;  These new operating systems exploit the capabilities andfunctions on the ES/9000 family and are based on Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA) and ESA/390.andP;  The common ESA/390 architecture is said toimprove the portability of applications from small to large systems and thecooperation of applications in different systems.andP;  VSE/ESA Version 1 is saidto remove growth constraints, offer new capabilities for applications, andexpand its affinity with MVS/ESA.andP;  Increased capacity is provided throughsupport of more virtual and real storage and channels.andP;  PR/SM can enhancesupport for development and test environments, while I/O enhancements canimprove data access.andP;  Transaction processing is enhanced with a new versionof CICS/VSE and incorporation of the Extended Recovery Facility (XRF),designed to provide enhanced availability for CICS/VSE applications.andO;Management of distributed environments is improved through VSE/DSNX, and,through a subset of MVS/ESA SAA functions--including COBOL II languagesupport.andP;  MVS/ESA SP Version 4 provides new functions and enhancements thatare intended to extend growth potential and manageability.andP;  APPC/MVS with SAACPI Communications support provides LU6.2 connectivity and can allowcooperative workstation applications to more effectively utilize MVSapplication services.andP;  ESCON channel support and dynamic reconfigurationmanagement allow configuration changes with minimal disruption.andP;  Multi-systemcoupling, or sysplex, can provide more effective resource sharing, horizontalgrowth, and better availability, while console consolidation allowssimplified operation of a system complex.andM;VM/ESA Version 1 consolidates the previous VM systems into a single platformand provides new functionality, performance, and throughput.andP;  A newimplementation of data in memory concepts is achieved through the use of VMData Spaces, providing virtually unlimited data addressability on the ES/9000line of processors.andP;  VM/ESA, utilizing data in memory concepts and expandedstorage for the Shared File System (SFS), can realize performance gains, saysIBM, and there are also improvements in performance for SQL/DS.andP;  WorkstationData Save Facility/VM enhances workstation management with the ability toautomatically backup and archive workstation data to the VM system, and IBMSAA Delivery Manager/VM allows customizing, controlling, and deliveringprograms and data files from the host to programmable workstations.andP;  Inaddition, cooperative processing is improved with VM/ESA.andM;Along with the S/390 family of operating systems, other specialized IBMoperating systems--such as DPPX/370 and AIX/370-- will also be supported onselected models of the new ES/9000 processors.andM;Enterprise ComputingandM;Building on the foundation of this new architecture, technology, systemssoftware, and hardware, IBM announced advances in functional areas that arekey to implementing enterprise-wide systems.andP;
