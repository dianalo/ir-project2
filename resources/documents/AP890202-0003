Closed roads and icy highways took their toll as at least onemotorist was killed in a 17-vehicle pileup in Idaho, a tour buscrashed on an icy stretch of Sierra Nevada interstate and 100-carstring of accidents occurred near Seattle.   ``February is going to be quite different from January,'' saidBob Snider, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in AnnArbor, Mich.   Midwesterners who chuckled at the weather in Alaska over theweekend while polishing their golf clubs got their comeuppance aswinter set in with a vengeance. The normally rainy Pacific Northwestgot a rare snowfall, and Easterners counted the waning hours ofspringlike weather as the cold front moved their way.   Bellingham, Wash., reported gusts over 100 mph early Wednesdayand 60 mph by midday, knocking out power to as many as 15,000customers. Snow caved in the roof of Everett's soccer center,causing $250,000 damage, officials said.   At least 20 people were injured when a tour bus carrying abouttwo dozen passengers overturned on icy, wind-swept Interstate 80 inthe Sierra Nevada, and six people were hospitalized, the CaliforniaHighway Patrol reported.   The big winter storm, with 60 mph gusts, knocked out electricalpower to a ``big chunk'' of Salt Lake City on Wednesday night, withblackouts extending 40 miles to Ogden, said Utah Power andamp; Light Co.spokesman Dave Eskelsen.   Eskelsen said engineers believed the outage was the result of``dirty rain'' coating insulators on power poles and blowing fuses,and some crews had reports of burning power poles.   In northern Minnesota, authorities blamed a night of minus20-degree temperatures for the hypothermia death of a 31-year-oldwoman whose frozen body was found on a sidewalk in Coleraine.   As the cold pushed into the country Wednesday, temperatures fell18 degrees in one hour at Ardmore, Okla., the National WeatherService said. Russell, Kan., which shared the nation's high of 84degrees Tuesday afternoon, had readings in the lower teens a daylater and wind chills in the 30-below-zero range.   With North Dakota's wind chills expected to dip as low as 80degrees below over the next several days, Gov. George Sinner orderedall schools to close until Monday.   ``The weather forecast for the next two days calls for bittercold to the extent that our young people are at risk, particularlythose being transported to school,'' Sinner said.   A wind-chill reading of 90 below was recorded Wednesday morningat Tioga, in northwestern North Dakota. The wind chill reading atmid-afternoon was 67 below at Williston.   In Idaho, where high winds and chill temperatures forced theclosing of many roads, crews worked to clear wreckage from a pileupon Interstate 84. Eight semi trucks and nine other vehicles wereinvolved, and at least one person was killed, said Lt. David Neal ofthe Idaho State Police in Twin Falls.   Not counting Alaska, Cut Bank, Mont., was the nation's icebox atmidday Wednesday, with a reading of 31 below zero, and temperaturesin the state were forecast to dip below 40 below by Thursdaymorning. Electric power in Great Falls, a city of 57,000, andseveral smaller towns in north-central Montana was knocked out fornearly an hour Wednesday morning when the Black Eagle hydroelectricdam broke down.   ``We don't know what caused it,'' said Cort Freeman, MontanaPower Co. spokesman. ``There's a lot of things that can happen inweather like this.''   In Alaska, where it all began as the thermometer went as low as60 below over the weekend, temperatures moderated Wednesday overmuch of the state except for the area near the Canadian border.While Anchorage was reporting just 11 degrees below zero and nowind, Northway on the Alaska Highway near the Yukon had a 7 a.m.reading of 59 below.   Northway posted an extreme of another sort when the barometricpressure reached 31.85 inches late Tuesday, a record high-pressurereading for the North American continent. The reading there easedoff Wednesday morning but was still a high 31.31 inches. It was theeffects of the high pressure system on the jet stream that createdthe unusual weather pattern.   The barometric pressure was so high that the Federal AviationAdminitration early Wednesday issued an order restricting instrumentand night flights over Alaska, saying that altimeters that usebarometric pressure might not calculate a plane's altitudeaccurately at that high pressure.   The snowfall at Seattle was enough to shut all runways atSeattle-Tacoma International Airport for nearly an hour Wednesdaymorning. The snowfall at the airport, 2 inches and counting atmidmorning, plus temperatures in the teens made it the worst wintryweather in Seattle in more than three years.   In the Plains, agriculture experts said the cold snap couldreduce the evaporation from farm fields, already dry from lastsummer's drought and the dry winter. But that was the only good newsfor farmers in the forecast.   Fruit growers worried that trees had begun to bud in the warmthand would now be in danger; the thirsty winter wheat crop in thesouthern Plains faced new stresses without the blanket of snow thatusually keeps it safe during the winter; and ranchers across thePlains worked Wednesday to shelter cattle from the sudden cold.   ``Now we've got something that's unbelieveable _ record highs,and suddenly within one day we go to cold temperatures,'' said SteveBaenziger of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln agronomy department.   But in the East, record highs continued to topple Wednesday. InBuffalo, N.Y., normally known for its wintry weather, the recordhigh for the date of 53, set just last year, was broken at 3 a.m.with a reading of 56 degrees. There was no snow on the ground, andLake Erie was not frozen.   It was 66 in Boston; 67 in New York City; 67 in Newark; 59 inColumbus, Ohio; and 70 in Roanoke, Va., all records for the date.   As winter swept toward the Great Lakes region, ski operators saidit couldn't come soon enough.   ``The crowds just don't see snow, and it stops them from comingout,'' said Sherry Gerych, ticket office manager at Mount BrightonSki Area in Michigan. ``As soon as it hits, we'll get ourselvesfixed up again.''</TEXT></DOC>
