Eighty-four patients (142 vessels studied)were divided into five categories, based on preangiographic diagnoses:carotid artery disease, tumor, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation,and miscellaneous. Each study was graded for diagnostic utility and visualizationof large vessels, small vessels, veins, and stains. Entry and exit skindoses were measured for film angiography and 512 x 512 and 1,024 x 1,024DSA. Small-vessel detail was judged to be inadequate in 13 of 142 studiesbut only one DSA study was judged to be nondiagnostic. The 1,024 x 1,024DSA skin doses were high but acceptable.</TEXT></DOC>
