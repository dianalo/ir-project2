InEast Africa, the most important mosquitoes are Anopheles gambiae sensustrictu, which transmits malaria, filariasis and the O'nyong-nyong virus;An. arabiensis, which transmits malaria, filariasis and the Tatguinevirus; and An. funestus, which transmits malaria, filariasis and theO'nyong-nyong and Tanga viruses. Other important vectors are Aedes simpsoni,which transmits yellow fever, and Ae. africanus, which is responsiblefor the forest cycle of the disease among monkeys. Cytological examinationof specimens of An. gambiae sensu lato resulted in 804 positive identificationsof the XB type chromosome only, indicating that An. arabiensis is themost abundant, and probably the only, member of the complex present,and constitutes close to 65.7% of the total mosquito population. Bloodmeal analysis of 1024 specimens showed its marked preference for bovid(51.9%) and human (28.1%) blood. Sporozoite rating by dissection andenzyme linked immunosorbent assay averaged 0.02%. Control methods triedin the past include chemical spraying and environmental management inthe Kisumu area. A trial against An. arabiensis is suggested at Karimavillage, in Mwea, whereby an integrated approach incorporating environmental,chemical and genetic measures could be undertaken. This would take advantageof the low population during the dry season from mid-December to mid-Apriland would involve biological larviciding, mass pyrethrum spraying andthe release of sterile males. There is a lack of adequate genetic knowledgeof this species, especially genetic markers and linkage relationships,even though chromosome maps are available and inversion polymorphismis better understood.
