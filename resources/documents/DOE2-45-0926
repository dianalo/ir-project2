<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-45-0926 </DOCNO><TEXT>Within the past few years, two novel computing techniques, cellular automataand neural networks, have shown considerable promise in the solutionof problems of a very high degree of complexity, such as turbulent fluidflow, image processing, and pattern recognition. Many of the problemsfaced in experimental high energy physics are also of this nature. Trackreconstruction in wire chambers and cluster finding in cellular calorimeters,for instance, involve pattern recognition and high combinatorial complexitysince many combinations of hits or cells must be considered in orderto arrive at the final tracks or clusters. Here we examine in what wayconnective network methods can be applied to some of the problems ofexperimental high physics. It is found that such problems as track andcluster finding adapt naturally to these approaches. When large scalehardwired connective networks become available, it will be possible torealize solutions to such problems in a fraction of the time requiredby traditional methods. For certain types of problems, faster solutionsare already possible using model networks implemented on vector or othermassively parallel machines. It should also be possible, using existingtechnology, to build simplified networks that will allow detailed reconstructedevent information to be used in fast trigger decisions.</TEXT></DOC>
