Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered the rating for Fruehauf's 9 3/4% notes, due 1996, to single-B-plus from triple-B, affecting about $50 million in debt.    Fruehauf said a large part of the accounting adjustments and other actions are nonrecurring and include the write-down of certain inventories, establishment of reserves for costs associated with closing certain operations, and increases in reserves for warranties and litigation. The maker of truck trailers and automotive parts said the adjustments will be partly offset by gains from the sale of certain properties, including some real estate and Fruehauf's sales and service branch in the Los Angeles area.    In last year's fourth quarter, Fruehauf earned $18.2 million, or 91 cents a share, on sales of $636.1 million. The company said the reduction in profit in the current quarter will lead to $5 million in additional borrowings.    Fruehauf also said shareholders approved the merger of LMC Acquisition Corp., a subsidiary of Fruehauf Holdings Inc., into Fruehauf Corp. Fruehauf Holdings was formed by certain members of Fruehauf's management and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. to effect the leveraged buyout of Fruehauf.    The merger is the second step of a two-part leveraged buyout. The first step was a joint tender offer by LMC Acquisition and Fruehauf for about 71% of Fruehauf's then-outstanding shares at $49.50 a share. The tender offer was completed Sept. 25. Fruehauf said it expects to complete the merger next week.    The company also said Bank of America informed it that syndication of a $950 million credit facility for Fruehauf Holdings and $50 million of additional international credit facilities have been completed, subject to final documentation.    Regarding Sandamp;P's decision to lower the rating on Fruehauf's 9 3/4% notes, a company official said &quot;It's typical that in a leveraged buyout, any debentures that stay outstanding would be lowered.&quot;    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
