The meeting was called by Egypt but was held in London becauseit was a more convenient location than Cairo.   Apart from Egypt, the other invited participants were the SovietUnion, China, Angola, Malaysia, Brunei, Oman, Mexico and Colombia.   Britain, which rejects group pricing policies for its North Seaoil, was not invited. Norway, another European producer, declinedto attend.   ``The meeting is at expert level with no ministers involved,''said a Mexican spokesman, who declined to be identified. ``Theyjust want to talk about the situation in the market, althoughobviously they are not in any position to take a decision.''   On Tuesday, Oil Minister Abdel-Hady Kandil of Egypt said themeeting was not against the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, ``but is an attempt by non-OPEC producers tohelp save the world oil market from further deterioration.''   There was speculation that OPEC may call an emergency meetingabout the oil price drop, due partly to increased output bynon-OPEC producers and a mild winter in Japan and Europe.   North Sea Brent crude for April delivery was quoted at $14.20 to$14.30 a barrel in London today. At its December meeting in Vienna,OPEC pledged to defend a price of $18 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
