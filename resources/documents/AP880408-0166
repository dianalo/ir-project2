(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A special grand jury that charged 15Mingo County politicians with buying slots on election ballotsstruck a blow against the corrupt practices that dominatedelections in southern West Virginia for years, a prosecutor says.   The practice of ``slating'' candidates and encouraging citizensto vote straight tickets has contributed to the conditions allegedin an indictment that was handed up Thursday, said specialprosecutor James Colburn.   ``I don't see how after this anyone could run as part of aslate,'' Colburn said.   Those indicted included a state senator, the county prosecutor,the mayor of Williamson, two county commissioners, two countyschool board members, three former delegates to the state assembly,one magistrate and one former magistrate, a former court clerk, aformer county clerk and a former school board member who was alsodirector of the county anti-poverty agency.   The state grand jury charged the 15 with paying to be listed onDemocratic slates controlled by former Sheriff Johnie Owens andwith using bribes and illegal campaign contributions to ``subvertthe free election system.'' The indictment focused primarily on the1984 election.   A 16th defendant, state Sen. Truman Chafin, was indicted on afelony bribery charge. He is accused of accepting a bribe when hewas a county commissioner to help current Mingo County SheriffCharles ``Eddie'' Hilbert ``buy'' the office from Owens for$100,000.   ``I've tried all my life to live a decent life, and somethinglike this is quite a shock,'' said one indicted man, RobertSimpkins, a member of the county school board.   ``I can't remember if I gave them any money, but it couldn'thave been any more than $500,'' said another of the accused, formerCounty Clerk Hugh Wellman. ``I didn't think there was anythingillegal about it. You go through life, and you forget these things.That's been four years ago,''   Colburn said the indictment should be a warning to otherpoliticians who might use slates to further their positions. Thegrand jurors, however, blamed residents of Mingo County for thedominance of slate politics.   ``This Grand Jury would urge that every citizen of Mingo Countynot sell or give up their franchise or right to vote, but toexercise it without fear or purchase,'' the jury's report said.   Former magistrate Bill Webb said the indictments ``wereblatantly political and were returned without any evidencewhatsoever.'' He said he will continue his re-election campaign.   Also indicted Thursday was Goodwill Motors Inc., a used cardealership at Delbarton owned by former county commissioner andformer county Democratic Chairman Stewart Justice. Justice was notnamed as a defendant.   Arraignment for all defendants is scheduled Wednesday in MingoCounty CircuitCourt.   Owens and Hilbert were not named in Thursday's indictments.   Owens pleaded guilty earlier this year in federal court to onecount of bribery and three counts of tax evasion and is scheduledto be sentenced on those charges April 18. He faces sentencing on astate income tax evasion count April 19.   Hilbert has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 13 felonycounts of buying his office, helping protect a drug ring in returnfor illegal campaign contributions and buying and selling marijuanaout of his office. He is scheduled to enter a plea to those chargeson April 18.   Colburn said the state grand jury will meet at least once more,on May 10, the date of the West Virginia primary, to hear evidenceof any violations in that election.</TEXT></DOC>
