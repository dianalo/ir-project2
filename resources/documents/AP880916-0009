By a 228-182 bipartisan vote Thursday, the House eliminated froman anti-drug bill a seven-day waiting period along with an optionalpolice background check of the purchaser.   The vote substituted a plan _ to be devised by the JusticeDepartment _ that would allow gun dealers to quickly identifyconvicted felons seeking to buy pistols. Sponsor Bill McCollum,R-Fla., said the amendment was his own idea and the major pro-gungroup, the National Rifle Assocation, came to him with its support.   The waiting period language was named symbolically afterpresidential press secretary James Brady, who was shot along withPresident Reagan in the March 30, 1981, assassination attemptagainst the president by John W. Hinckley Jr.   Brady's wife, Sarah, vice chair of Handgun Control Inc., calledthe vote ``disappointing and discouraging.'' She added, ``We cameclose. Twenty-four more votes would have made a difference.''   The NRA's chief political operative, Wayne LaPierre, predictedthat any attempt to resurrect the waiting period in the Senate thisyear would fail because sentiment there was ``even stronger''against the waiting period.   To change the House result, 24 members would have to reversecourse _ a seemingly insurmountable number for such a politicallysensitive issue.   The three-million-member NRA, which once faced little oppositionin its lobbying against gun control, was up against a formidablefoe this time: a coalition of gun control groups and lawenforcement organizations that was better organized than everbefore.   Supporters of the waiting period believed they had a betterchance of winning their legislation by making it part of a popularanti-drug bill near election time.   But they guessed wrong, and the coalition's predictions of arazor-close vote proved inaccurate. NRA supporters were able tomuster backing from 101 Democrats and 127 Republicans. Opposingwere 137 Democrats and 45 Republicans.   The overall drug bill would add some $2 billion to the nation's$3.9 billion drug fighting effort. A final House vote is expectednext week. The Senate still has to consider its own drug fightingbill.   In the closing moments of debate, waiting period supporter Rep.William J. Hughes, D-N.J., urged members to ``show how tough we arewhen it comes to bucking the National Rifle Association and the gunlobby.''   NRA backer Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., said after the vote thatthose comments backfired.   ``Taking on the NRA is one thing and taking on gun owners isanother,'' Volkmer said. ``There's no question the NRA had a lot todo with it,'' he said, but attributed most of the substitute'ssupport to individual gun owners who contacted their lawmakers.   Both sides brought police officers to Washington to lobby fortheir positions.   The McCollum amendment would order the Justice Department todevelop _ within 180 days _ a system that would allow gun dealersto check whether the applicant is a convicted felon.   McCollum has said the system, which would be submitted toCongress, could include a telephone check such as the one thatstores use to verify that credit cards are valid.   His language also requires that probation be revoked for anyonefound in possession of firearms.   Dewey Stokes, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said,``I don't mind losing a fight when it's fair, but we were outgunnedon this, and by outgunned I mean dollar bills. It's a shame whenour congressmen have to listen to a single-shot issue group'' likethe NRA.   Supporters of the waiting period had argued the device waseffective in the 22 states that had it, citing figures thatCalifornia screened out more than 1,500 ineligible gun applicantsin 1986; and New Jersey stopped an average of 500 felons each yearfrom buying guns.   But Rep. Harley O. Staggers Jr., D-W.Va., said a NationalInstitute of Justice study ``says criminals actually avoid goingthrough legal channels'' to obtain guns. The institute is a JusticeDepartment research agency.</TEXT></DOC>
