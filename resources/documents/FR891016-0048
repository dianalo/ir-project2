TETCO states that pursuant to andSection; 157.212(a) of the Commission'sRegulations, it requests authorization to add the new delivery point, Mandamp;RStation No. 2636, to the individual service agreements covering serviceto PECO under Rate Schedules CD-1, CD-2 and FT-1 of Texas Eastern's FERCGas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1. TETCO states that Mandamp;R StationNo. 2636 was previously authorized for service to PECO under TETCO's RateSchedules SS-2, SS-3 and FTS-2 in Docket No. CP88-808-000. TETCO statesthat no new facilities are to be constructed. According to TETCO, Mandamp;RStation No. 2636 is located in Worchester Township, Montgomery County,Pennsylvania where TETCO's pipeline system interconnects with pipelinefacilities owned by PECO. TETCO states that upon receipt of Commission authorization, TETCO and PECOwill execute individual superseding service agreements providing for thedelivery by TETCO to PECO of quantities of natural gas presently certificatedunder TETCO's Rate Schedules CD-1, CD-2 and FT-1. The superseding serviceagreements will establish a Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO) forthe new delivery point as follows: 14,000 dekatherms (dt) per day for RateSchedule CD-1 and CD-2, and 14,000 dt per day (less applicable shrinkage)for Rate Schedule FT-1. TETCO states that there will be no change in MDDOat the other existing delivery points in the superseding service agreements,nor any increase in the total contract quantities. TETCO adds that thenatural gas quantities delivered to PECO will be utilized as general systemsupply by PECO. TETCO further states that the addition of Mandamp;R Station No. 2636 willhave no effect on TETCO's peak day or annual deliveries. To the extentdeliveries are made at Mandamp;R Station No. 2636, TETCO states that deliveriesmay be reduced at the other points of delivery to PECO on a day-to-dayoperational basis. Therefore, TETCO states that the addition of the newdelivery point to each of the three service agreements as proposed willnot result in any change in the total contract quantities deliverable underthe individual service agreements providing for service to PECO pursuantto Rate Schedules CD-1, CD-2 and FT-1.
