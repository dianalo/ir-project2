On Tuesday, Macmillan accepted a cash-and-securities buyoutoffer valued at $90.05 a share from the investment firm KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co.   The agreement also gave Kohlberg an option to buy four ofMacmillan's businesses under ``limited circumstances,'' which werenot spelled out in the announcement. Macmillan said details wouldbe filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Macmillan had set a Monday afternoon deadline for submission of``final'' buout offer. That evening, Maxwell said Tuesday, he toldMacmillan he was increasing his offer to $89 a share in cash. Theoffer apparently fell short, as did Maxwell's outstanding tenderoffer of $86.80 a share.   Macmillan stock jumped $1.50 a share to close at $88.62{ Tuesdayon the New York Stock Exchange.   A spokesman in New York for Maxwell Communication Corp. said itwas evaluating the Kohlberg offer but would not comment on whetherMaxwell planned to raise his $89 a share bid.   Maxwell said he had asked the Macmillan board to inform him ifit received a higher bid so that he could have an opportunity toquickly top it.   ``I am shocked that (they) would enter into this hasty,ill-conceived ... junk-bond financed offer with KKR without evencontacting me,'' he said in a statement.   Macmillan rebutted that Maxwell was ``given every opportunity toamend his bid.''   Earlier this month, Macmillan agreed to a Kohlberg-led buyoutand then backed out when Maxwell bettered the price.   But analysts speculated Kohlberg's latest bid would end theauction. Even the most optimistic observers said the company wasworth little more than $90 a share.   ``It's a bidding war, and it has become more than just aneconomic question at these prices,'' said Robert Dunlap Jr., ananalyst at Brown Brothers Harriman andamp; Co. The issue has become ``whocan eke out the highest bid.''   Part of Maxwell's motivation in pursuing Macmillan lies in hispersonal commitment to create one of the world's largestcommunications concerns. He already owns major U.S. printingoperations and extensive media holdings in Britain.   While Maxwell likely could afford to top Kohlberg's bid, ``hesaid he was willing to pay a fair price, but not a stupid price''for the company, said Bert Boksen, an analyst at Raymond, James andamp;Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.   Analysts said Kohlberg Kravis probably would break Macmillanapart and put most of its emphasis on the company's informationservices.   The unit, which accounted for 40 percent _ or $62 million _ ofMacmillan's operating profit in 1987, has grown rapidly in recentyears. Dunlap expects the unit, which publishes directoriesincluding Who's Who and trade magazines, can continue to grow at a25 percent annual rate.   If all 27.8 million Macmillan's shares were tendered,shareholders would receive $82.05 in cash, $3 in notes and warrantsvalued at $5 for each share they hold. The proportion of cash wouldchange if fewer than the company's 27.8 million shares weretendered.   Maxwell said he believed members of the financial community``have valued the Kohlberg bid at less than $89 a share.''   The Macmillan board approved Kohlberg's initial $85-a-shareproposal in mid-September, but withdrew its backing last week afterMaxwell raised his offer to $86.80 a share from $80.   Macmillan has been embroiled in a takeover contest since May,when a group led by wealthy Texan Robert N. Bass proposed a buyoutat $64 a share.   The Bass group since has dropped out of the bidding, with itslast offer at $75 a share.   In an attempt to head off a takeover attempt, Macmillan proposeda financial restructuring it valued at about $64.15 a share, butthe Bass Group challenged the plan in court and won an orderblocking it.   The restructuring would have split Macmillan into two companies_ publishing and information services _ and paid a special cashdividend to shareholders.   In addition to its book publishing and information servicesoperations, Macmillan owns the Katherine Gibbs secretarial andBerlitz language schools.</TEXT></DOC>
