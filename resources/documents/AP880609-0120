(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People who arrange surrogate births for aprofit would face up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fineunder legislation approved today by the Michigan House.   Representatives voted 90-10 to outlaw pregnancy-for-paycontracts as being unenforceable and contrary to public policy.   However, the legislation would let a woman in a surrogacyagreement be compensated for her expenses. She also could acceptgifts from the contracting couple, as long as it's clear the giftdidn't amount to the buying of a child.   The legislation would guarantee that in the case of a custodydispute the baby would remain with its mother until a judgedetermined whether it was in the child's best interest to givecustody to the father.   The Senate is expected to give final approval, said Sen. ConnieBinsfeld.</TEXT></DOC>
