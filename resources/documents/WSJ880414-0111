Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole, the French farm bank that indirectly owns 10% of Buitoni S.A., the group's French unit, had requested that such an expert be designated if it couldn't reach an agreement over the sale price with Mr. De Benedetti. The two sides failed to reach an accord in negotiations over the past week.    Credit Agricole argues that the French assets are undervalued in the transaction. It also says that, as a result of Mr. De Benedetti's decision to sell only Buitoni's assets while retaining control of the operating companies, minority shareholders in Buitoni now hold stock in a holding company that has &quot;nothing to do&quot; with the food company they invested in.    The bank wants Mr. De Benedetti to cede part of the proceeds of the sale to minority shareholders in Buitoni S.A.    Sources at Buitoni said they will wait to see the expert's report, which will offer an evaluation of what would be a fair price but won't have a binding effect. Meanwhile, trading in Buitoni shares on the Paris market remains suspended. </TEXT></DOC>
