The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South AfricanCouncil of Churches, said hundreds of people from the home area ofthe coup leaders had been harassed or detained by soldiers ofBophuthatswana and South Africa.   South African troops put down the coup hours after rebelsoldiers in the nominally independent black territory seized itspresident and several top officials Wednesday.   Col. David George, police spokesman in Bophuthatswana, said 374people had been detained in a continuing police operation.   He would not comment on reports that most belonged to theProgressive People's Party. Party leader Rocky Malebane-Metsing wasinstalled briefly as president during the 15-hour coup and remainsat large.   The Star newspaper in Johannesburg quoted sources it did notidentify as saying five members of the homeland parliament from theparty were taken from their homes Thursday.   The highest-ranking soldier in the rebellion, Warrant OfficerTimothy Phiri, and other alleged army rebels were charged withtreason, which carries the death penalty, the South African PressAssociation reported.   It said later that Phiri was not among the first 33 accusedsoldiers, who appeared in magistrate's court Monday in Mmabatho,capital of the homeland.   Chikane said those detained included members and officials ofMalebane-Metsing's party abd people thought to have voted for itlast year.   He said a crackdown could provoke ``massive resistance that mayresult in a violent confrontation between the South African-backedbantustan (homeland) forces and the people of Bophuthatswana.''   Anti-apartheid activists condemn the homeland system as anattempt by white authorities to divide and weaken the blackmajority. About half South Africa's 26 million blacks live in the10 tribal homelands.   Bophuthatswana, with a population of 1.7 million people in sevenseparate parcels of land, is one of four homelands South Africa hasdesignated as independent. They are not recognized abroad.</TEXT></DOC>
