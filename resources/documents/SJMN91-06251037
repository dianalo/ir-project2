Then, when it seemed they had none left,each took one last deep breath and hit some more.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SELES, NAVRATILOVA LEAVE UPSETTING WAKECAPRIATI NEAR TEARS, GRAF STUNNED AFTER SEMIFINALLOSSES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  U.S. Open Tennis  </MEMO><TEXT>     Seles, just enough older and just a bit more savvy, finally was able toconserve her strength just enough to out-slug Capriati to win their U.S. Openwomen's semifinal match 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3).;   The triumph advanced Seles,17, into her first U.S. Open final, where she will play Martina Navratilovatoday. Navratilova, 34, moved into her eighth Open final with a well-played,well-thought 7-6 (7-2), 6-7 (6-8), 6-4 upset of top-seeded Steffi Graf.;  After playing until she could barely get a serve over the net, Capriati wasnear tears. &quot;I just think I wasn't aggressive enough,&quot; she said. &quot;It's tough,you know, when the match was just in your hands and it slipped away.&quot;;   Attimes Friday, it seemed that neither Seles nor Capriati, 15, would make it outof the match intact.;   Grunting and groaning, squealing and squeaking, firstSeles, then Capriati, and finally Seles again seemed to have pummeled thefight right out of her opponent. There was no intricate game plan in thismatch, only a brutal war of attrition from the baseline.;   After losing thefirst set more out of carelessness than anything else, Capriati got her gamecranked up.;   She was serving aces at better than 100 mph. Twice in the thirdset, in fact, Capriati was serving for the match. It became clear, though,that she had already given too much. Now, Capriati had trouble getting firstserves into the 80s, and Seles was crunching service-return winners.;   Seles,who has won the Australian and French Open titles this year, officially becamethe No. 1-ranked player in the world with her win Friday. She found thatunimportant for now, preferring to concentrate on not being &quot;a frozen chicken&quot;today on the court where Navratilova has won four titles.;   Without a GrandSlam final appearance since the 1990 Wimbledon, Navratilova has pursued thisOpen title with renewed joy and vigor.;   She confounded Graf with herrelentless pressure at the net.;   &quot;Of course I was going to attack,&quot;Navratilova said. &quot;If I missed a few (volleys), it didn't matter. I was justgoing to keep on coming.&quot;;   Navratilova said she won't change anything today.&quot;I'll be recharged overnight,&quot; she said. &quot;I played very well today, and Ithink I can do it again . . .&quot;;   In the seven times they've met so far,Navratilova has beaten Seles four times.;   &quot;You know,&quot; Seles said, &quot;Martinais playing better tennis. I think she played great tennis today. She is goingto run to the net every moment she can. So, I am just going to have to hitvery hard and make my passing shots.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910907  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  543  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, September 7, 199100251037,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
