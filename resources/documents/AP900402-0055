Irene Jones, a community leader participating in the talks, saidthe accord could cut noise at the airport, known as ``Sea-Tac,'' inhalf by 2001.   ``This is the most comprehensive noise-control program of anymajor airport in the country,'' said Paul Dunholter, a noiseconsultant with Mestre Greve andamp; Associates of Newport Beach, Calif.The agreement was reached late Saturday after 17 months ofinformation-gathering and negotiation.   Dunholter's firm provided technical assistance to the Sea-TacAirport Noise Mediation Committee, a panel of representatives fromairlines, community groups, the Port of Seattle and otherorganizations.   The plan will be submitted to Port of Seattle commissioners onThursday. The port owns the airport.   It would establish a steadily shrinking noise ``budget'' forairlines, narrow flight corridors over heavily populated areas andrestrict noise during plane maintenance.   The agreement is unusual because it was designed byrepresentatives of all groups working together, instead ofpiecemeal by lawsuits, said Jerry Cormick, a mediator in the talks.   ``I'm sure that if any airport tried to to impose the variousthings these groups did they'd end up in court in a moment,'' saidCormick, who is northwest director for The Mediation Institute.   Cormick, who helped referee the talks, predicted the plan wouldserve as a model for airports around the country. He said theplan's strength lies in its direct, detailed changes to reducenoise.   ``It isn't just a set of fuzzy recommendations,'' he said.   The plan calls for an allowable noise budget for each airlineserving Sea-Tac. The budget shrinks over successive years, asairlines would be encouraged to acquire newer, quieter planes.   To reduce ground noise, the agreement calls for less revving ofplane engines at night and bans the use of engines to power a planeas it backs out of a gate area.   A noise-abatement committee would be established. It wouldinclude local residents who would help monitor and enforce noiserestrictions.   One issue the committee could not agree on was an overall flightplan for the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration hasproposed a plan, but Cormick said the committee did not endorse it.   Cormick said port commissioners were likely to approve theoverall plan. The Port of Seattle spent more than $800,000 oncommittee activities and technical assistance.</TEXT></DOC>
