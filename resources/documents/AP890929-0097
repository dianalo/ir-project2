(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Carolinans showed President Bushroofless buildings, decimated forests and other legacies of Hugotoday, while the president defended his administration's handlingof aid to the storm's victims.   ``I do know that there's been a critic or two _ that's less thanI would have expected. But to the critics I simply say Iunderstand. We are trying very hard,'' Bush said at the CharlestonAir Force Base at the end of his two-hour visit.   Before touching down at Charleston, Bush signed a $1.1 billionrelief package approved by Congress on Thursday. He was greeted onhis arrival by Gov. Carroll Campbell and Charleston Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr., the latter of whom had criticized a planned aerial tourby the president as being too removed from the people.   However, bad weather forced Bush to travel by motorcade throughCharleston and to Summerville, an inland town 22 miles northwest,which suffered major utility and timber damage.   Summerville Mayor Berlin Meyers showed Bush the grounds of theDorchester County Courthouse littered with fallen trees, smashedvehicles and twisted metal.   The president, patting the mayor on the shoulder, said, ``Why amI here? I'm here to give a little encouragement to a courageousman.''   The weather cleared enough by midmorning for a 15-minutehelicopter tour of the coast.   Bush told reporters of some chats he had with Summervilleresidents.   ``One thing that touched me very much was a young homeownerthere saying that he had had offers of help from all over thiscountry,'' Bush said. ``I think it does bring out the very best inthe men and women of America who want to help in a tragedy of thisnature.''   The president then departed for an engagement in Annapolis, Md.   Before Bush's arrival, Riley, a Democrat, had complained:``Airplane rides and helicopter rides are nice but everything is onthe ground. The buildings are on the ground, the people are on theground, the stress is on the ground and we need a president who ison the ground.''   Riley said it was ``absolutely ridiculous'' that only twofederal disaster claims offices have opened in the Charleston area.   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has opened five claimsoffices across the state to serve 17 counties that have beendeclared disaster areas. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid today the president would increase the number of FEMA officesin South Carolina to nine.   There were long lines at those offices Thursday as thousands ofpeople applied for grants and low-interest loans to help coverstorm losses not covered by insurance.   An angry Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., also criticized FEMA.   ``We've got to make sure everything possible has been done atthe Washington level. FEMA is still the bottleneck,'' he said.   But U.S. Rep. Arthur Ravenel, a Republican whose districtincludes Charleston, blamed partisan politics for some of thecriticism.   ``It's very easy to find fault and point fingers,'' Ravenelsaid, adding he believed FEMA was moving as fast as it could tospeed storm relief to the state.   Meanwhile, an insurance group estimated Thursday that Hugocaused $2.5 billion in insured losses in the state.   The preliminary figure, released by the Property Claim ServicesDivision of the American Insurance Services Group, does not includeuninsured losses, state-insured property, marine and harborfacilities, aircraft, utility equipment or public property such asroads and bridges.   In Washington, Robert Sheets, director of the National HurricaneCenter, told a Senate subcommittee on environmental protectiontoday that the damage from Hugo probably will total $2 billion and``I wouldn't be surprised if it was much more.''   Charleston residents were somewhat lucky in the path the Sept.21 storm took, Sheets said, since Hugo's maximum strength struckjust north of the city in the Francis Marion National Forest, wherefew people live.   Meanwhile, aid continued to flood in from around the nation _shipments included 5,000 cases of baby food, four tons of pet foodand a ton of Mississippi catfish.   The American Red Cross said it had donated $42 million to aidhurricane victims in the Caribbean and on the mainland, making itthe largest relief effort in the organization's history.   Charleston officials have opened a hotline to obtain theservices of contractors and artisans to help rebuild historicbuildings, and artisans from Massachusetts and Illinois havearrived. About 75 percent of the 3,500 city structures deemed ofhistorical value were damaged in the storm, city historians said.   The death toll from Hugo was 29 in the United States, including18 in South Carolina. The storm is blamed for 33 deaths in theCaribbean.   Animals also fell prey to the fury of Hugo's 135 mph winds, TheNews and Courier of Charleston reported today.   The Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, home to a number ofendangered and threatened species, lost an undetermined number ofanimals, its visitor's center and dock, according to refuge managerGeorge R. Garris.   The storm also swept away 50 years of refuge records, includingnest counts of loggerhead sea turtles, a threatened species.   On Bull's Island _ part of the refuge _ at least two red wolvessurvived, Garris said. Transmitters in the collars of theendangered wolves show the male and one of his five daughters aremoving around the island. The other four female pups don't appearto have changed position since before the storm.   At least 203,000 power customers remain without power, more thanhalf of those in the Charleston area. Riley said power had beenrestored to about 20 percent of the city.   The Charleston International Airport reopened Thursday. Althoughthe concourses weren't open because of storm damage, 20 incomingand outgoing commercial flights used the facility.</TEXT></DOC>
