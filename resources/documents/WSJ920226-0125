The 7-2 ruling could affect a large number of bankruptcycases in which the government is owed taxes or some otherpayment from an insolvent company or its officers.</LP><TEXT>   Under a centuries-old legal doctrine known as sovereignimmunity, the government is generally protected against legalactions seeking money damages. But the federal BankruptcyCode states that when a government agency formally makes aclaim against a debtor company, it essentially waivessovereign immunity and opens itself to certain types ofcounterclaims by the debtor. One such counterclaim could bebased on an alleged overpayment of taxes.   In its decision, however, the Supreme Court said that whena government agency doesn't make a claim in a bankruptcycase, the code doesn't contain a waiver of sovereignimmunity. The government's immunity is considered to havebeen waived only when a statute does so &quot;unequivocally,&quot; thehigh court said. And the relevant section of the BankruptcyCode doesn't contain such a waiver, the court concluded.   In a 1989 decision, the Supreme Court said that stategovernments were similarly protected against monetary claims.   In the case before the high court, the Justice Departmenthad warned that if the court interpreted the Bankruptcy Codeto contain a broad waiver of sovereign immunity, the federalgovernment would be exposed &quot;to significant monetaryliability under a wide variety of . . . provisions.&quot;   The case involved the bankruptcy-court proceedings of anOhio ski shop operator. An officer of the company drew a$26,000 check on the firm's corporate account, using most ofthe money to pay individual taxes he owed to the InternalRevenue Service. When a trustee for the company appointed bythe bankruptcy court discovered the unauthorized withdrawaland transfer, the trustee sought to recover the money. Abankruptcy court judge ruled that the company officer'stransaction was improper and ordered the IRS to return$20,000 of the amount to the company. A federal districtcourt and appeals court affirmed that decision.   On an appeal by the Justice Department, the Supreme Courtreversed the lower-court rulings. Justice Antonin Scaliawrote the majority opinion, concluding that the relevantsection of the Bankruptcy Code doesn't &quot;unequivocallyexpress&quot; a waiver of the government's immunity from legalactions seeking monetary damages. Justice Scalia based thedecision strictly on the text of the code, refusing toconsider its legislative history or broader legal principles.   Justice John Stevens, in a dissent joined by Justice HarryBlackmun, said the majority's decision, in effect, condonedthe transfer to the federal government of money &quot;stolen&quot; froman insolvent company. Justice Stevens stressed that &quot;despiteits ancient lineage, the doctrine of sovereign immunity isnothing but a judge-made rule that is sometimes favored andsometimes disfavored,&quot; often depending on whether a giveninterpretation would be fair.   Moreover, Congress generally has intended to allow partiesin bankruptcy proceedings to seek money owed to them by thegovernment, Justice Stevens said.   (U.S. vs. Nordic Village Inc.)</TEXT></DOC>
