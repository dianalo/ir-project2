Advertisers have begun to shun explicit programming in responseto protests by viewers. Their decision not to back ``Crimes ofPassion II'' did not appear related to ratings, since an earlierepisode of the show aired last October and did well.   The first ``Crimes of Passion'' garnered a 13.2 rating and 23share in the Wednesday time period now occupied by ``China Beach.''By comparison, ``China Beach'' had a 12.2 rating and 21 share lastweek. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 90.4 millionhouseholds with television. The share is a percentage of sets inuse.   Advertisers pulled out of NBC's Geraldo Rivera special on devilworship earlier this season and others backed off from NBC'ssatirical ``Saturday Night Live.'' A Michigan woman's campaignagainst Fox's raunchy ``Married ... With Children'' receivedpublicity earlier this year. Fox says the relatively high-ratedshow remains sold out nonetheless.   An ABC press release for ``Crimes of Passion II,'' whose host isBruce Dern, said it ``explores real-life cases in which people havecommitted an act of violence aimed against someone they love.''   It's replacements, ``Livin' Large'' and ``Heart and Soul,'' wereamong the lowest-rated shows of the week.</TEXT></DOC>
