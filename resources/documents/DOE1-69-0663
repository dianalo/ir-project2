<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0663 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Des Moines District Heating and Cooling Assessment Study shows that:District heating and cooling are technically feasible, with the IowaPower Plant as a primary energy source with cogeneration and three typesof distribution media: high and low temperature water for heating andchilled water for cooling. District heating is economically feasible,but additional studies are needed for cooling. In general, district coolingshould be considered mainly in addition to heating, except perhaps forsmall systems. To be economically feasible, the large consumer/producers(Capitol Complex, Drake University, and the four hospitals) should beincluded, and a strong marketing effort conducted to induce a large portionof major downtown buildings to join the system. To help in marketing,piping connections and system conversions in the buildings or groupsof buildings should be included in the overall construction project andits financing. Further consideration should be given to construct themetro refuse burning plant as an additional energy source for districtheating and cooling, or to have this function take place at the IowaPower Plant with fluidized-bed boilers. The large consumer/producerscan reduce the peak load conditions and enjoy reduced interruptible rates.The Iowa Gas Company could be considered as an alternate energy source,with a downtown location for a DHC plant.</TEXT></DOC>
