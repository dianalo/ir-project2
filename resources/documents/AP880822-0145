Dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants demanded a governmentinvestigation of the ``numerous crimes'' committed during protestsSunday and an explanation of what dissidents said was a new policeunit created to break up demonstrations.   The arrests came during rallies marking the Soviets' 1968 moveinto Czechoslovakia to stop the liberal reforms of the ``PragueSpring.''   Protesters who were arrested were brought into a closedcourtroom Monday and most received jail sentences of 10 to 15 daysand fines of up to $320, the dissidents said.   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, provided details in arare report on court proceedings and carried police accusationsthat protesters acted illegally.   Tass said 96 people were arrested. But members of the DemocraticUnion, a new group calling itself an alternative to the SovietCommunist Party, claimed as many as 150 people were arrested.   Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman for the Democratic Union, said in atelephone interview that dozens of people remained in Moscow jailsMonday night, awaiting court appearances.   ``We demand the creation of an investigatory group of theProcurator of the U.S.S.R. for a full investigation of the numerouscrimes committed by the so-called law enforcement organs on Aug.21, 1988,'' Grigoryants, editor of the dissident journal Glasnost,said at a news conference in his Moscow apartment.   About 500 demonstrators took part in an initial protest inPushkin Square, chanting ``Prague, Prague, Prague,'' when they wereprevented from holding up banners. About 500 paramilitary officersand police charged and dispersed them.   About 100 people took part in a later protest, which also wasbroken up, dissidents said.   Grigoryants was detained outside a police station and said hesaw several demonstrators being beaten. Dissidents said about 30people were kicked or beaten.   Grigoryants said Andrei Babitsky, an editor of Glasnost,received a concussion from a beating in a police bus, and that anambulance was called twice Sunday evening to the police station totreat him.   Maj. Gen. Nikolai Myrikov, deputy head of the Department ofInternal Affairs in Moscow, harshly criticized the rally organizers.   ``The organizers of the rally shouted provocative slogans,carried posters whose contents were an insult to the dignity ofSoviet people, spread slanderous leaflets, and instigated thosepresent to illegal actions,'' the Tass report quoted Myrikov assaying.   Grigoryants said demonstrators were beaten by about 10 membersof what he described as a new force formed to break up protests.   Members of the squad wore khaki clothing without insignia, heavyblack boots, and berets with markings of the Ministry of InternalAffairs, Grigoryants said.   A woman who was at one of the demonstrations, Anna Savankova,said she was told by a policeman at the scene that the force wasspecially trained to break up demonstrations.   The crackdown was in keeping with the Kremlin's steadfastdefense of the Soviet-led invasion by Warsaw Pact forces on Aug.20-21 in 1968, although some Soviets have suggested the ``PragueSpring'' reforms crushed in Czechoslovakia resemble those now beingtried in the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
