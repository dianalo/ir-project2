Like Dr. Irwin, who came to the bank only a year ago fromthe U.N. system, I too am a newcomer to the institution. Ijoined in 1988 after 20 years in investment banking. The bankthat I have come to know, however, is a very different placefrom the one that Dr. Irwin describes.</LP><TEXT>   I've found it to be a remarkably efficient institution.Despite the complexity of its work -- promoting developmentand fighting poverty in nearly 100 countries -- the bank'sadministrative costs are only 0.5% of its total assets. Thisis an enviably low figure -- one that any private financialinstitution would be happy to have.   I have also found bank staff -- whether in the financecomplex, where I work, or in other units -- to be highlyqualified, experienced and dedicated. Like me, most of themjoined the bank after years in other fields of endeavor. Thisapplies, by the way, to the bank's corps of senior managers,most of whom were not &quot;cloned&quot; within the institution (as Dr.Irwin implies), but joined after distinguished careerselsewhere. A vivid example of this fact is that of the bankgroup's top seven officers, six have extensive non-bankexperience. These include its president, Barber Conable, thesenior officers in lending, finance and legal affairs as wellas the executive vice presidents of IFC and MIGA.   In his piece, Dr. Irwin touches upon salaries. The bankmust be able to attract high-caliber staff members in orderto discharge its mission. But these salaries are hardlyexorbitant, and many staff members, myself included, have hadto take pay cuts when they joined the institution. Moreover,salaries are reviewed constantly and compared periodicallywith remuneration levels at public- and private-sectorinstitutions in North America and Europe and are adjusted inline with such salaries.   Is the bank perfect? Of course not. It has shortcomingslike any other institution. But in my two years here I havebeen struck by its efficiency, by the professionalism andmotivation of its staff and by its willingness to examine andrenew itself periodically from within. In these importantregards, I have not found it wanting in comparison with theprivate sector.   Dr. Irwin has a different perception of the bank. He iscertainly entitled to it. I cannot help but believe, however,that his views would have been more positive if he had workedat the institution longer and if he had been in closercontact with those at the bank who are engaged in itsday-to-day work.   Donald C. Roth   Vice President and Treasurer   World Bank   Washington   ---   While Dr. Irwin criticized the World Bank's bureaucracy, Ifound refreshing the commitment by its officers and managersto their work and the alacrity with which they performed it,especially when compared with the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of theprivate sector. And this despite the reorganization inprogress as mentioned by Dr. Irwin. In fact, nowhere inWashington did I find as much receptivity to ideas as at theWorld Bank. My encounter with the bank brought me in contactwith new financial instruments and programs designed toanticipate changing global economic and politicalrelationships such as in Eastern Europe and Asia; many ofthese efforts were at the cutting edge of environmental,health, nutrition and human-rights concerns.   Because the bank's effectiveness rests largely on thevitality and cooperation of its employees, it is in part aliving testimony to its own purposes: Few institutions whosemakeup comprises as much cultural diversity and intellectualcapacity can boast of as many accomplishments (including theUnited Nations, which Dr. Irwin draws upon for comparison).   Some of Dr. Irwin's points may be well taken, yet they aredevoid of appreciation for the ideals that must have inspiredhim to join the bank in the first place. It is unfortunatehis criticism seemed to be sour grapes. One must wonder howmuch he tried to overcome frustrations during his tenure. AsW.B. Yeats said: &quot;Joy is the will which labours, Whichovercomes obstacles, Which knows triumph.&quot;   Barry Peters   Weston, Conn.</TEXT></DOC>
