In a victory for employers, the court ruled 4-3 that a worker whois fired without good cause, in violation of a company's express orimplied promise, can sue only for reinstatement and back pay, andnot for emotional distress and punitive damage awards that often aremuch larger.   Citing the need for ``commercial stability,'' Chief JusticeMalcolm Lucas wrote that it was ``important that employers not beunduly deprived of discretion to dismiss an employee by the fearthat doing so will give rise to potential tort recovery (foradditional damages) in every case.''   The court allowed employees to seek the additional damages whentheir firings involved violations of public policy, such as aworker's refusal to violate a law. But Lucas placed new limits onsuch lawsuits, saying the policy involved must serve the public andnot merely the employer's interests.   One pro-employee aspect of the ruling was the court's willingnessto allow lawsuits to proceed based on an oral promise of continuedemployment.   Justice Allen Broussard, who wrote one of three separatedissenting opinions, accused the majority of ``a radical attempt torewrite California law in a manner which ... will leave thewrongfully discharged worker without an adequate remedy.''   The ruling reinstates but sharply limits a lawsuit by DanielFoley, who was fired from his $56,164-a-year job as Los Angelesbranch manager of Interactive Data Corp. in 1983, after telling thecompany that his boss was being investigated by the FBI forembezzlement from a former employer.   The boss later pleaded guilty to embezzlement. Foley, who had aspotless record in nearly seven years of employment, refused atransfer to another office and was fired two days after he got amerit bonus of $6,762.   His lawsuit, still in the pretrial stages, contends the firingviolated a company promise of continued employment and was a pretextfor covering up wrongdoing, in violation of public policy. Today'sruling allowed Foley to proceed with his lawsuit but limited hispotential damages to lost salary payments.</TEXT></DOC>
