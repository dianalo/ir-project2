On March 31, 1988, Middle East TubeCo., Ltd. (``METCO''), the respondent, requested an administrative reviewof the order. We published the initiation on April 27, 1988 (53 FR 15083).The Department has now conducted that administrative review in accordancewith section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council,has developed a system of tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Scheudle (HTS), as providedfor in section 1201 <T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s)Imports covered by this review are shipments of Israeli ``oil country tubulargoods (OCTG),'' in both finished and unfinished condition. OCTG consistsof hollow steel products of circular cross-section intended for use indrilling for oil or gas. These products include oil well casing and tubing,of carbon or alloy steel, whether welded or seamless, manufactured to eitherAmerican Petroleum Institute (``API'') or non-API (such as proprietary)specifications. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiableunder the following items of the Tarriff Schedules of the United StatesAnnotated:<ITAG tagnum="43">610.3216</ITAG><P>610.3219</P><P>610.3233</P><P>610.3234</P><P>610.3242</P><P>610.3243</P><P>610.3249</P><P>610.3252</P><P>610.3254</P><P>610.3256</P><P>610.3258</P><P>610.3262</P><P>610.3264</P><P>610.3721</P><P>610.3722</P><P>610.3751</P><P>610.3925</P><P>610.3935</P><P>610.4025</P><P>610.4035</P><P>610.4210</P><P>610.4220</P><P>610.4225</P><P>610.4230</P><P>610.4235</P><P>610.4240</P><P>610.4310</P><P>610.4320</P><P>610.4325</P><P>610.4335</P><P>610.4942</P><P>610.4944</P><P>610.4954</P><P>610.4955</P><P>610.4956</P><P>610.4957</P><P>610.4966</P><P>610.4967</P><P>610.4968</P><P>610.4969</P><P>610.4970</P><P>610.5221</P><P>610.5222</P><P>610.5234</P><P>610.5240</P><P>610.5242</P><P>610.5243</P><P>610.5244</P>This merchandise is currently classifiable under the following HTS items:<ITAG tagnum="42">7304.20.10.00</ITAG><P>7304.20.20.00</P><P>7304.20.30.00</P><P>7304.20.40.00</P><P>7304.20.50.10</P><P>7304.20.50.50</P><P>7304.20.60.10</P><P>7304.20.60.50</P><P>7304.20.20.00</P><P>7304.20.40.00</P><P>7304.20.60.00</P><P>7304.20.80.00</P><P>7304.20.10.30</P><P>7304.20.10.90</P><P>7304.20.20.00</P><P>7304.20.30.00</P><P>7304.20.40.10</P><P>7304.20.60.10</P><P>7304.20.60.50</P><P>7304.20.80.10</P><P>7304.20.80.50</P>The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes.The written description remains dispositive of the scope.The review covers the period June 11, 1986 through December 31, 1987 andnineteen programs. METCO was the only known exporter of OCTG to the UnitedStates during the period of review.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>(1) Investment Grants under the Encouragement of Capital Investment Law(``ECIL'')The purpose of the ECIL is to attract capita to Israel. In order to beeligible for various benefits under the ECIL, including investment grantsand long-term industrial development loans, the applicant must obtain approvedenterprise status. Approved enterprise status is obtained after reviewof information submitted to the Israel Ministry of Industry and Trade,Investment Center Division. The amount of the benefits received by approvedenterprises depends on the geographic location of the eligible enterprise.In order to receive a grant under the ECIL, an applicant must obtain aneconomic viability evaluation of the proposed investment from the IndustrialDevelopment Bank of Israel. METCO received approvals for grants in 1971,1974, 1975 and 1976. According to the approval documents, these grantswere contingent upon increased exports. Therefore, we preliminarily determinethat the grants given to METCO are export subsidies.Using the declining balance methodology, we allocated each grant receivedover 15 years, the average useful life of assets in the steel industry,according to the ``Asset Guideline Classes'' of the Internal Revenue Service.Because there is no fixed-rate long-term borrowing in Israel, we used asa discount rate a variable rate. The discount rate is the national averageshort-term borrowing rate for new Israeli shekels, adjusted for inflation,during the period of review as published in the Bank of Israel annual report.We allocated the benefit from these grants over METCO's total exports.On this basis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this programto be 0.003 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for the period June 11, 1986 through December 31, 1986and 0.001 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for the period January 1, 1987 through December 31,1987.(2) Insurance from Israel Foreign Trade Risk Insurance Corporation (``IFTRIC'')The Exchange Rate Risk Insurance Scheme (``EIS''), which is operated byIFTRIC, insures exporters against losses occurring when the rate of devaluationof the shekel does not keep pace with the rate of inflation. If the rateof inflation is higher than the rate of devaluation, the exporter is compensatedin an amount equal to the difference between the two rates multiplied bythe value added by each exporter to the exported merchandise. If the rateof devaluation is higher than the change in the domestic price index, however,the exporter must compensate IFTRIC. The premium is paid on the basis ofthe value-added of the exports.In determining whether an export insurance program provides a countervailablebenefit, we examine whether the premiums and other charges are adequateto cover the program's long-term operating costs and losses. We found inthe <T3>Final Countervailing Duty Determination; Oil Country Tubular Goodsfrom Israel</T3> (<T3>``OCTG''</T3>), (52 FR 1649, January 15, 1987), that this program conferreda countervailable benefit on exports of OCTG from Israel because the EISoperated at a loss in the five years from 1981 through 1985, and that fiveyears is a sufficiently long period to establish that the premiums andother charges are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs andlosses of the program. In the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; Certain FreshCut Flowers from Israel</T3> (52 FR 3316, February 3, 1987), we found thatthe EIS also operated at a loss in 1986. In 1987, we found that the EIScontinued to operate at a loss. On this basis, we preliminarily determinethat this program is countervailable.We calculated the benefit from this program by dividing the net amountof compensation METCO received by the value of its total OCTG exports duringthe period of review. On this basis, we preliminarily determine the benefitfrom this program to be 4.30 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for the period June 11, 1986 through December 31, 1986and 4.30 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for the period January 1, 1987 through December 31,1987.(3) Long-term Industrial Development LoansMETCO received long-term industrial development loans under the ECIL thathad outstanding balances during the review period. In the final determinationin <T3>OCTG,</T3> we determined that these loans were limited to a specificenterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries, becausewe had no information on the approval process or actual distribution ofthe loans. However, in the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; Industrial PhosphoricAcid from Israel</T3> (<T3>``Industrial Phosphoric Acid''</T3>) (52 FR 25448, July 7, 1987), wedetermined that long-term industrial development loans are countervailableonly to the extent that the applicable interest rates are less than thoseon loans to companies located in the Central Zone (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the heavily populated and developed zone). Because METCOis located in the Central Zone, it paid the highest rate charged for long-termloans at that time. Therefore, we preliminarily determine that these loansto METCO are not countervailable.(4) Bank of Israel Export LoansThe Government of Israel provides short-term financing to exporters inIsrael through the following credit funds administered by the Bank of Israel:(a) Export Production Fund (EPF).(a) Export Shipment Fund (ESF).(a) Import-for-Export Fund (IEF).We determined in <T3>Industrial Phosphoric Acid</T3> that loans under these funds were notprovided at preferential rates after July 1985. Therefore, we preliminarilydetermine that these loans from the Bank of Israel are not countervailable.(5) Other ProgramsWe also examined the following programs and preliminarily determine thatMETCO did not use them during the review period:a. Dividends and Interest Tax Benefits Under section 46 of the ECIL.b. Drawback Grants.c. ECIL Interest Subsidy Payments.d. ECIL Loans.e. ECIL Preferential Accelerated Depreciation.f. Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development Law.g. Equity Maintenance Allowance.h. Labor Training Grants.i. Special Export Financing.j. Reduced Corporate and Income Tax Rates Under Section 47 of the ECIL.k. Tax Deductible Inventory Adjustment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of Review</ITAG>As a result of the review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy tobe 4.30 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for the period June 11, 1986 through December 31, 1986and 4.30 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for the period January 1, 1987 through December 31,1987.Section 707 of the Act provides that the difference between the amountof a cash deposit, or the amount of any bond or security, for an estimatedcountervailing duty and the duty determined under a countervailing dutyorder shall be disregarded to the extent that the estimated duty is lowerthan the duty determined under the order, which was published on March6, 1987. The rate in our preliminary determination (51 FR 21201, June 11,1986) was 2.12 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> and is lower than the rate determined in this review.In accordance with section 705(a)(1) of the Act, the final determinationin this case was extended to coincide with the final antidumping determinationon the same products from Israel. Because, pursuant to Article 5.3 of theSubsidies Code, we cannot impose suspension of liquidation for more than120 days without the issuance of a countervailing duty order, we terminatedthe suspension of liquidation for entries or withdrawals made on or afterOctober 9, 1986 and before March 6, 1987, the date of publication of thecountervailing duty order. We reinstated suspension of liquidation andthe requirement for collection of estimated countervailing duties for entriesor withdrawals of the subject merchandise made on or after the date ofpublication of the countervailing duty order.Therefore, the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to assesscountervailing duties of 2.12 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on allshipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, forconsumption on or after June 11, 1986 and before October 9, 1986. Entriesor withdrawals made on or after October 9, 1986 and before March 6, 1987are not subject to countervailing duties. The Department intends to instructthe Customs Service to assess countervailing duties of 4.30 percent ofthe f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of this merchandise entered,or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after March 6, 1987and exported on or before December 31, 1987.Further, the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to collecta cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties, as provided by section751(a)(1) of the Act, of 4.30 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on allshipments of Israeli OCTG entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after the date of publication of the final results of this administrativereview.Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication.Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publicationor the following workday. Any request for an administrative protectiveorder must be made no later than five days after the date of publication.The Department will publish the final results of this administrative reviewincluding the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such writtencomments or at a hearing.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and andSection; 355.22 of the CommerceRegulations published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52354) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.22).<ITAG tagnum="6">Eric I.
