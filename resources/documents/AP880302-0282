(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Lorillard Inc. tobacco company sought todownplay discounts that its insurance company affiliate wasconsidering offering to non-smokers several years ago, according toevidence in a lawsuit against three cigarette makers.   The contention was made Tuesday as a federal jury heardtestimony and read documents that allegedly show the tobaccoindustry sought to suppress information on the health dangers ofsmoking.   The suit filed by Antonio Cipollone of Lakehurst, claimsLorillard, Philip Morris Co. and Liggett Group Inc., are liable forthe lung cancer death of his wife Rose, a 40-year smoker.   Cipollone alleges the companies failed to do enough research oncigarettes, did not reveal what they did know, failed to warn thepublic of health dangers and did not put a safer product on themarket.   One document released Tuesday, dated March 3, 1980, was writtenby Chicago-based CNA Insurance Co. officials and discussed arecommendation for non-smoker discounts, according to Marc Z.Edell, Cipollone's attorney.   At the time, CNA was owned by Loew's Theatres Inc., which alsoowned Lorillard. Loew's has since sold the tobacco company.   ``It is recognized that the introduction of non-smokers discountcould prove embarrassing'' to Loew's and Lorillard, the memostated. In order to minimize the potential for embarrassment, itsuggested that CNA and Lorillard jointly prepare a carefullyconstructed statement saying the discount ``in no way supports orrefutes the contention that smoking causes health defects.''   ``CNA should further refrain from advertising or otherwisepromoting non-smoker discounts,'' it continued.   The issue also was discussed in a letter dated Nov. 5, 1979,from Lorillard senior vice president and general counsel, Arthur J.Stevens, to CNA Chairman Edward J. Noha.   Stevens wrote that when the cigarette manufacturing trade group,the Tobacco Insitute, heard of Allstate Insurance Co.'s plan tooffer a non-smoker discount the institute sought help from CNA ``inan effort to perhaps dissuade Allstate from that course of actionby supplying background data.''   Lorillard spokesman Chuck Wall said Lorillard and the institutedid nothing improper but merely were trying to counteractanti-cigarette propaganda.   According to another document released Tuesday, a TobaccoInstitute official stated in 1972 that the industry's defenseagainst cigarette critics included ``creating doubt about thehealth charge without actually denying it.''   The internal memorandum describes the ``three major fronts'' _litigation, politics and public opinion _ where the tobaccocompanies had fought to defend itself.   The ``brilliantly conceived and executed'' strategy, used in allthree areas, helped ``win important battles,'' said the memo.   However, ``it is only fair to say that it is not _ nor was itintended to be _ a vehicle for victory,'' said the May 1, 1972 memofrom Fred Panzer to Horace R. Kornegay, president of the TobaccoInstitute.   Wall identified Panzer as an institute vice president.   The document says the industry had followed a ``holdingstrategy, consisting of:   _creating doubt about the health charge without actually denyingit;   _advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urgingthem to take up the practice;   _encouraging objective scientific research as the only way toresolve the question of health hazard.''</TEXT></DOC>
