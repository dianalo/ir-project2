Several leading oil ministers -- including Venezuela'sCelestino Armas, who is president of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries -- aren't due until thismorning. But it was clear last night from the ministers whohad arrived that there is a consensus that fourth-quarterdemand for OPEC's oil is going to be higher than currentproduction of 23.5 million barrels a day.</LP><TEXT>   Saudi Arabia, the world's chief oil exporter, is theleading proponent of increased production to prevent apossibly sharp escalation in oil prices as a result of theexpected rise in demand. On his arrival last night, HishamNazer, the Saudi oil minister, confirmed that the kingdomfavors a higher fourth-quarter production ceiling as thecatalyst for the output increases. He wouldn't say how highhe wants the ceiling to go.   But other OPEC and industry sources said the Saudis arelikely to push for the ceiling to go up to as much as 24.5million barrels a day. That would lock in the Saudis' shareat 8.5 million barrels a day, a figure Mr. Nazer had saidlast June that he expected Saudi Arabia to have by September.That also would make room for Iraq and Kuwait as they resumeexporting oil.   The ceiling is a major issue, however, and there will beconsiderable debate at this meeting on whether the 13producing nations should raise it at all, or keep it where itis -- or whether it really matters.   The current production ceiling was set earlier this yearat 22.3 million barrels a day and has been widely ignoredsince. Still, several oil ministers want to hold the ceilingdown around that level as a possible deterrent to higherproduction. Their idea is to firm up oil prices. The pricesof the basket of seven crudes used by OPEC as a benchmarklast week averaged $19.24 a barrel.   &quot;I want $21 -- that's all I want,&quot; said Nordine AitLaoussine, Algeria's minister, on his arrival late yesterday.   Several other OPEC members, including Indonesia, Libya,Iran and, ironically, Iraq, also likely will support steps toboost prices toward the target by nearly $2 a barrel beforeyear end, mainly by keeping some limits on production asdemand arises. Iran, a former price &quot;hawk,&quot; has become moremoderate in recent months, moving toward the Saudi position.But Iraq is holding to its goal of higher oil prices, eventhough it isn't allowed to export oil at the moment becauseof the United Nations embargo.   Osama A. R. Al-Hiti, Iraq's oil minister, suggested herethat the increases in demand for OPEC oil are going to beless than generally believed. Still, he said, &quot;if they keepthe ceiling, they could accomplish the target price.&quot; Also,he said, Iraq is ready to resume selling oil and could beginexporting quickly at least one million barrels a day. Hewouldn't discuss, however, last week's UN resolution thatwould allow Iraq to sell $1.6 billion of its oil on worldmarkets for humanitarian reasons but under strict control.   Iraq isn't disagreeing with Saudi Arabia over the level ofdemand for OPEC oil. Few question that demand will besomewhat higher in the fourth quarter because of seasonalfactors and the combination of the economic recovery of majoroil consuming nations such as the U.S. and the sharp drop inoil exports from the Soviet Union.   Views differ widely, however, on the size of theanticipated demand gains. Forecasts range from 23.6 millionbarrels a day -- estimated by oil economists at OPECheadquarters in Vienna and at the International EnergyAgency, the Paris-based group of major oil-consuming nations-- to as much as 25 million barrels.   A group of economic experts from each of the 13 membernations of OPEC have met here for the past two days to reviewthe range of estimates. They agreed on a single figure to bepresented to the oil ministers today. It's understood thatthe economic experts' report concludes that demand for OPECoil in the fourth quarter will average just under 24 millionbarrels a day.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of most soybean futurescontracts settled lower and corn prices settled mixed. Amongother things, prices were under pressure from harvest-relatedfutures hedging by grain elevator operators. With the harvestpicking up steam, grain elevators typically sell futurescontracts at the Chicago Board of Trade to hedge their croppurchases from farmers. After the close of trading, Illinoisofficials reported that 47% of the state's corn crop washarvested, compared with a five-year average of 15%. TheIllinois soybean harvest is about 25% complete. The weeklycrop report by the major farm states detected some damagefrom last week's early frost. Iowa officials reported that52% of the state's soybean crop is in excellent or goodcondition, compared with 65% a week earlier. Wheat pricesfell.                                                                                                          COFFEE:  Futures prices sank on rainfall in Brazil andlack of progress by producers to push forward a plan towithhold coffee from the market. Coffee for December deliveryended 1.6 cents a pound lower at 89.2 cents. Producers'inability over the weekend in London to agree to thecoffee-retention plan, and resistance by consumer nations,including the U.S., to the plan cast doubts on the prospectof any agreement emerging at the meeting of the InternationalCoffee Organization this week, said Celeste Georgakis, senioranalyst at Cargill Investor Services. In addition, rainfallin Brazil, although not enough to relieve drought conditions,had a psychological effect on the market, she said. The lackof rain so far hasn't been critical because it was too early,she said, &quot;but now we would start getting concerned. If fromhere on we don't get rain, it could be a problem.&quot; PeterLeavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services Corp.in Bedford, Mass., said the dry weather is expected tocontinue through this week, with a chance for showers late inthe week.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices fell. Cotton for October deliveryended 1.99 cents a pound lower at 64.08 cents; the activelytraded December contract lost 1.68 to finish at 65.98 cents.Ernest Simon, cotton specialist at Prudential Securities,attributed the selling to technical factors. Some traderstook profits after Friday's rally, he said, adding that manytraders who had bet the price would rise sold off-settingcontracts ahead of &quot;first notice day&quot; today to avoid beingsubject to taking delivery of physical cotton. Sellers offutures contracts begin to make their delivery intentionsknown on first notice day. Sharon Johnson, cotton specialistat Cargill Investor Services, added that every time the pricenears 68 cents, as it did Friday, the rally fails. Prices hadstrengthened on concerns about a cold spell in West Texas,but Ms. Johnson said that even though the region could lose ahalf million bales of cotton and quality might be lowered,the total domestic crop is still very large. Prices over thenext few days will depend on the delivery activity, she said,but predicted a range of 65 cents to 68 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
