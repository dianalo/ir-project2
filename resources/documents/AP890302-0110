Sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 704,000 inJanuary, following a 2 percent increase in December, the CommerceDepartment said. New sales were bolstered by strong activity in theMidwest.   Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association ofHome Builders, said much of January's increase probably occurredbecause warm weather brought more people out to shop for homes,borrowing sales from future months.   The increase also may reflect a temporary dip in mortgageinterest rates during the month, which gave home buyers a ``windowof opportunity to move into the market,'' Seiders said.   January's strong showing aside, analysts still are forecasting adecline in construction of single-family homes this year based onexpectations that mortgage rates will rise during the first half of1989 and the economy will slow.   New home sales had edged up a slim 0.9 percent during 1988 afterplunging 10.5 percent in 1987, when the drop was blamed on increasedinterest rates and a slowdown in demand after five strong salesyears.   After temporarily sliding during January, fixed-rate homemortgages resumed their climb in February and last week wereaveraging 10.78 percent, up from 9.87 percent a year earlier,according to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp.   Economists predict rates could reach 12 percent this year,although the increasing popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages thatoffer lower initial interest rates could mitigate damage to thesingle-family housing market.   As the Federal Reserve Board continues to push up interest ratesin an effort to slow economic growth and restrain inflation, higherrates ``are really going to bite into the housing market,'' saideconomist Richard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Association.   ``We are going to start to see some modest declines in housingmarket activity once we get the numbers for March, April and May,''Peach predicted.   Seiders said that with financial troubles plaguing the nation'ssavings and loans, which are the largest lenders of adjustable-ratemortgages, ``we're kind of worried about the funds situation as wego out through 1989.''   January's increase in home sales was the biggest monthly jumpsince a 5.4 percent increase last June.   The strength was concentrated in the Midwest, where sales rose22.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 110,000.   Seiders said the increase was largely due to mild weather in thatregion, although the Midwest's housing market also has been aided bythe strength of manufacturing industries experiencing rising exportsales.   Sales last month were up 8 percent in the West and rose 0.9percent in the Northeast, but declined 1.9 percent in the South.   The median price for a new home, meanwhile, declined 6.9 percentin January to $113,000, meaning half the homes sold for more andhalf for less. The average price, which is pulled up by sales ofvery expensive homes, also was down, falling 8.2 percent to $137,100.   Peach said the drop in price probably was linked to the shift ofsales toward the less-expensive Midwest rather than any trend towarddeclining prices nationally.</TEXT></DOC>
