ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Trans World Airlines has announced plans toupdate and expand its fleet with the purchase of up to 40 AirbusIndustrie jetliners in a deal worth more than $3.6 billion _ thelatest in a series of big aircraft purchases by U.S. airlines.   TWA, the nation's eighth-largest air carrier, said Tuesday ithad placed firm orders for twenty A330-300 wide-body aircraft, withoptions to purchase 20 more of the twin-engine planes.   The two companies said in a statement TWA could convert up tohalf the ordered planes and half the optioned jets to A340s,Airbus' four-engine, long-range wide-body aircraft.   TWA had been expected to announce an order since last October,when it said it would lease or buy 60 new narrow-bodied aircraft.The airline's chairman, Carl Icahn, said Tuesday the company alsoplans to buy narrow-bodied planes in the future.   Business has been booming recently for domestic and foreignaircraft manufacturers. Over the past two months, American Airlinesannounced up to $14 billion in aircraft purchases planned through1994, including planes by U.S. companies Boeing Co. andMcDonnell-Douglas Corp. and the Dutch manufacturer Fokker.   In January, Braniff Inc. said it would buy up to 100 Airbus 320jets in a deal that could reach $3.5 billion.   Icahn said in an interview that TWA's new planes would be usedto expand its fleet and replace older aircraft. Icahn said thecarrier's planes have an average age of 12.5 years.   TWA's unions have complained in recent years about its agingplanes, contending that Icahn had agreed to upgrade the fleet inacquiring the airline in 1986.   But Icahn denied Tuesday that the Airbus purchase resulted fromany union pressure to revitalize the TWA fleet.   Airbus Industrie said it expected to begin delivering the A330sto TWA in late 1994 or early 1995.   TWA said it would use the planes, which seat 301 passengerseach, on major North American and trans-Atlantic routes.   Airbus Industrie, owned by a European consortium, is a majorcompetitor of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas.   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Craig Martin said hiscompany had competed for the TWA order with its 767 widebodytwin-jet plane.   In the past, TWA has been a good Boeing customer, buying thecompany's 727s, 747s and 767s in its fleet. It currently has noBoeing planes on order.   William Whitlow, who follows Boeing for the investment firm DainBosworth Co. in Seattle, said, ``I suspect that Airbus maybe hadsome fairly attractive terms in terms of price and financing.''   ``Boeing's not going to win them all,'' he said, referring toBoeing announcements so far this year of orders for 102 aircraftworth more than $8.2 billion, on top of last year's record ordersfor 636 jets worth $29.7 billion.   Phil Friedman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., saidhe doubted Boeing's backlog of orders was a factor in the TWApurchase.   ``They would have been able to get 767s by 1994,'' when theA330s are scheduled to be delivered, he said.   McDonnell-Douglas had no comment on the TWA-Airbus deal, saidDon Hanson, a spokesman for the company's Douglas Aircraft division.   But, he added, ``TWA has been a good customer of ours for ourMD-80s and we expect that good and fruitful relationship tocontinue...''   The narrow-body MD-80s are among TWA's newer planes.   Icahn took TWA private last October. In the third quarter of1988, the company reported earnings of $88 million, up from $57.1million a year earlier, while its revenue rose to $1.27 billionfrom $1.21 billion.   The company has not yet released fourth-quarter figures, but aTWA source said earnings rose during the period.</TEXT></DOC>
