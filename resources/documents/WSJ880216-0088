Last week ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; devoted an entire program to the reasons why Congress has chosen to hold itself above the law in such matters as the Ethics in Government Act, job safety, freedom of information, fair hiring practices and civil rights.    The occasion for this was the conviction of Lyn Nofziger, known in Washington as a free spirit who has made a trademark of a Mickey Mouse tie, for lobbying without a license. He had contacts with former colleagues within a year after leaving the White House, an offense Congress has voted a felony. After the verdict, Mr. Nofziger appeared before television cameras and blew the whistle on the hypocrisy inherent in this law.&quot;It's a lousy law,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn't apply to the Congress. It doesn't apply to the judiciary. It doesn't apply to those below a certain salary level.&quot;    In the program on congressional exemptions from this and other laws, ABC's Brit Hume began the show with an unusual announcement: &quot;In preparing for this broadcast, the people who ask guests to appear tried and tried and tried to find someone who would come on the program and defend this. And we couldn't find anybody who would do it, but obviously for many, many years, Members of Congress have been voting for laws which had these exclusions, so somebody must've been for it.&quot; So he went on the air with three critics, Rep. Barney Frank, the New Republic's Fred Barnes and lobbyist James Coyne, a former congressman and White House aide.    Rep. Frank will hold hearings this spring on a possible expansion of the ethics laws to cover Congress. The tradition of exempting Congress, he claimed, has deep roots in English law, going back to &quot;the efforts by Queen Elizabeth I to manipulate the Parliament in the 16th century when they were just starting out.&quot; It may have made sense back then, he said, but Congress doesn't need such protection today. He also claimed that in preparing his hearings, &quot;I've yet to find anybody who disagrees that the time has come for Congress to be covered under this Ethics in Government Act.&quot;    Mr. Coyne didn't think any of this had much to do with Elizabeth I: &quot;Congress likes to consider itself a club of lawyers that can protect itself and hold as much power in its own reins and try to reduce as much as possible power that's in the hands of the President and the executive branch. And I think that's what's occurred in the past 10 years or so. More and more power being vested in Congress to the point where Congress has become an imperial Congress, doing the very things that it criticized presidents in the past for doing.&quot;    It was Mr. Barnes, though, who really cut through the fog: &quot;Well, I wish that Congressman Frank, if he really wanted to cut down on the most egregious kind of lobbying, would get Members of Congress to stop lobbying the administration to get contracts and grants for their own constituents and supporters.&quot;    But of course, Congress will not stop doing that, nor will it prohibit former congressmen from doing it. But for doing the same thing, people like Lyn Nofziger now face jail sentences. Only in Washington could this be done under the rubric of ethics. </TEXT></DOC>
