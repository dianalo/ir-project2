Born and raised in Gilroy, Scagliottibases many of his recipes on those that his mother used to prepare.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Weekly, Part 2  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FREMONT MAN DISHES UP TASTE OF ITALYFOND MEMORIES OF POLENTA TOPPED WITH CHEESE, MEAT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Weekly Cook  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;Both of my parents came to Gilroy in the early 1920s from the Piedmontregion of Northern Italy in order to farm,&quot; Scagliotti said. &quot;At the time, myparents were attracted to Gilroy because many Italian immigrants livedthere.&quot;;   An only child, Scagliotti grew up in an adult Italian world thatkept its identity by carrying on the traditions of its homeland.;   &quot;One ofthe ways that we kept in touch with the traditions of the old country wasthrough food,&quot; Scagliotti said.;   Every season there would be a differentcelebration in which food played a major role in bringing his family's friendstogether.;   In the fall, Scagliotti's parents would have a polenta feed.;  &quot;Polenta is a hearty peasant dish made from cornmeal designed to keep you warmon a cold day,&quot; Scagliotti said. The cornmeal is usually cooked slowly on thestove in either water, chicken stock or milk. Once thickened, the polentamight be enhanced with salt, pepper, a ground hard cheese such as Asiago orRomano and seasoned with fresh herbs, such as chopped basil, sage or oregano.;  &quot;The mixture is then spread into a greased, shallow pan and left to cool andthicken further. Before serving, the polenta is either left in the pan andheated in the oven, or cut into squares or diamonds, removed from the pan andheated on a grill. In both cases, before the polenta is reheated, it isusually topped with a distinctively flavored cheese like fontina so that itwill melt onto the top of the polenta.;   &quot;Our polenta feeds were a goodexcuse for friends to get together,&quot; Scagliotti said. &quot;We would serve ourpolenta topped with a traditional red meat sauce. Most of our friends ownedorchards and hunted in them. If they were lucky on the day of our polentaparty, our sauce might be made with fresh rabbit, quail, pigeon or pheasant.If not, chicken or pork sausage was used as the meat. The next morning, anyleftover polenta was pan-fried and served with eggs.&quot;;   Another fall andwinter party favorite at the Scagliotti's farm was the &quot;bagna cauda feed.&quot;;  &quot;Bagna cauda literally means hot bath,&quot; Scagliotti said. &quot;It is really a hotolive oil dip for fresh vegetables seasoned with a mixture of garlic andanchovies. My mother would have platters of curly cabbage leaves, slices ofbell pepper, fresh mushrooms, Jerusalem artichokes and cardone for dipping andthick slices of sweet French bread to catch the drippings.;   &quot;We wouldusually start the evenings with antipasto platters of Italian deli meats andcheeses. Then the guests, usually 15-20 people, would stand around dippingvegetables into the bagna cauda. For dessert, all the relatives would bringtheir favorite homemade Italian pastries. The last course was always grapesand Gorgonzola cheese.&quot;;   Scagliotti brings the Italian simpatico feeling ofhospitality that he learned from his parents to any food occasion in which heis involved. One of the original members and presidents of an East Bay chapterof the Sons of Italy founded in 1969, Scagliotti &quot;got used to organizingfund-raising dinners for 100-150 people. As my children became school-age, Ialso helped put on fund-raising dinners for their schools.&quot;;   If you wouldlike to have an Italian-style bagna cauda feed of your own this fall,Scagliotti offers these recipes.; BAGNA CAUDA; 1 cup butter; 1 cup olive oil;8-10 cloves garlic, finely chopped; 10-12 flat anchovy fillets, finelychopped; salt and freshly ground pepper to taste; Melt butter with oil in asmall sauce pan over medium heat.
