Charles Jones and Thelma Colvin dated as teen-agers in the1920s, but a spat at a street party in Springfield ended theirromance - temporarily.   Jones broke off a two-year relationship with Colvin after seeingher strolling with another man, despite her protests of innocence.   When they met again last fall, both widowed, the dispute nolonger mattered. They got married Thursday in Decatur's MaconCounty Courthouse.   ``I still think she was seeing that other guy,'' Jones, 84,joked.
