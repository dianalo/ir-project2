Officials of Hyundai Motor, which is part of South Korea's Hyundai industrial group and is the nation's largest car maker, said the plant's output stopped following the breakdown of the seventh round of management-union talks that began May 18.    The union was seeking an increase of 48%, or $183, in monthly earnings, excluding bonuses. Management offered a 25% raise. Officials said Hyundai Motor workers with five to six years of experience now earn about $821 a month, including bonuses and other allowances.    The officials said the strike will cost Hyundai an estimated $19 million daily.    Earlier this year, another Korean auto maker, Daewoo Motor Co., halted production for 20 days because of a strike. It resumed production May 2.    Meanwhile, work at another Hyundai company, Hyundai Precision andamp; Industry Co., which makes rail cars, remained suspended yesterday for the fourth consecutive day because of a dispute over wages and working conditions. Company officials said strikers were preventing about 10 executives from leaving their offices. </TEXT></DOC>
