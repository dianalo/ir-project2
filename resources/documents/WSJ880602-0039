The denial, contained in a memo to staffers yesterday, appears to contradict court testimony last week by Tim Elliott, Lord Geller's chief operating officer. Mr. Elliott testified that the International Business Machines Corp. account, by far Lord Geller's largest, is in jeopardy.    However, the internal memo -- signed by Mr. Elliott and two other top executives -- said IBM has &quot;most definitely not fired us nor do they intend to do so.&quot;    Mr. Elliott couldn't be reached for comment. An IBM spokeswoman said, &quot;There has been no change in our relationship with Lord Geller. They are still our agency of record. There is no account review under way.&quot; She declined to comment on reports that IBM has sent Lord Geller a 90-day notice of termination.    The memo also said the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. account remains solid. &quot;They have not asked any other agency to compete for the business,&quot; it said. A spokesman for Dean Witter, a unit of Sears Roebuck andamp; Co., said, &quot;Lord Geller is still our ad agency and we have not put them up for review.&quot;    Several clients, including Chemical Bank, Barbar Group and Napier Co., said yesterday they were satisfied with Lord Geller's work and had no plans to move. The memo said Anne Klein II plans to leave, but Fuji Photo Film USA, which planned to terminate its relationship with the agency next month, &quot;has asked us to handle a piece of their business through next fall.&quot;    Schieffelin andamp; Co. is reviewing its $8 million Hennessy Cognac account. Lord Geller is scheduled to give a presentation today in competition with five other agencies.    The memo points up the difficulty that Lord Geller, a unit of WPP Group PLC, faces in its lawsuit against the departed executives and the new ad agency they formed, Lord Einstein O'Neill andamp; Partners. WPP is trying to show it will be irreparably damaged unless the judge makes permanent a temporary injunction barring Lord Einstein from hiring Lord Geller employees or accepting its clients.    While the testimony in New York State Supreme Court depicts Lord Geller as facing client problems, the agency's communications to employees and the public depict it as healthy.    Separately, WPP asked State Supreme Court Judge Herman Cahn to cite Lord Einstein for civil contempt for releasing Mr. Elliott's testimony, which is sealed, to reporters covering the trial. WPP also asked that he cite Lord Einstein's attorneys, and ad agency Young andamp; Rubicam, which helped finance Lord Einstein.    WPP contends Lord Einstein purposely released the testimony. A Lord Einstein lawyer said, &quot;this is at best a mistake by a young paralegal.&quot; Judge Cahn said he won't act on the request until WPP's law firm, files formal papers.    Also yesterday, WPP's chief executive officer, Martin Sorrell, took the witness stand. Lord Einstein's attorney questioned him about WPP's attempts to set up a Lord Geller network in Europe. Mr. Sorrell acknowledged that he hadn't told Lord Geller's management they wouldn't be able to pick their own employees in Europe; many of those employees had been working on the Ford Motor Co. account at sister agency J. Walter Thompson Co. until Ford dropped Thompson.    The Lord Einstein lawyer read from a January 13 letter to Mr. Sorrell from the head of Thompson's office in Milan, who apparently was organizing the network. In the letter, the Thompson executive said, &quot;We can control communications from our side . . . I hope we can also control Mr. Dick Lord's official reactions!&quot; Mr. Lord at the time was chairman of Lord Geller. He is chairman of Lord Einstein. </TEXT></DOC>
