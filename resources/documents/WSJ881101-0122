Among other things, the proposed rules would eliminate controls on the export of many kinds of commonly available software. They also would reduce current restrictions on the transmission to non-Communist countries of technical information involving the production and sale of strategically important products designed in the U.S.    Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of Commerce for export administration, said streamlining the rules would make the export guidelines more &quot;user-friendly&quot; to U.S. technology vendors, improving their ability to compete in global markets. A rapidly growing international market already has seen U.S. software sales increase to an estimated $11 billion this year from $5.3 billion in 1984, and they could soar to $20 billion by 1990, according to Commerce Department figures.    After hearing comments from the U.S. industry, the department plans to publish the final regulations next January.    The software proposal is in line with earlier moves by the U.S. and its allies to allow older generations of computers to be sold to the Soviet bloc. Software is widely recognized as a major U.S. technological strength.    Mr. Freedenberg said some of the early software programs introduced by Microsoft Corp. and Lotus Development Corp. are among those that could be freely exported to any destination, including Eastern bloc countries. The proposed rules wouldn't relax restrictions on exports of more advanced programs.    The technical data on which export controls would be relaxed include blueprints, manufacturing processes and instructions for the maintenance and repair of U.S. computers and other sophisticated products.    Under the proposal, the department would eliminate much paperwork currently required before U.S. companies can export such know-how. Companies deemed trustworthy would be granted &quot;unrestricted&quot; licenses to transmit technical data overseas without receiving specific permission from the department. </TEXT></DOC>
