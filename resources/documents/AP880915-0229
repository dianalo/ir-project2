Officials of the Pittsburgh-based company said Wednesday thatthe plan would create a profit-sharing pool when the company's U.S.operations exceed a return of 6 percent on assets. Employees wouldshare 17 percent of profits above that threshold, they said.   Alcoa officials said individual payouts would vary with profitsand the number of employees involved. The plan is retroactive toJan. 1, the company said.   Alcoa said the payout could amount to about 7 percent of eachemployee's base salary if second-half 1988 profits equal first-halfprofits.   In contract talks three weeks ago, the company offered aprofit-sharing plan to union employees that would amount to up to$1,300 for blue-collar workers, based on Alcoa's expected 1988profits.   The United Steelworkers said it rejected the plan as inadequateand said it opposed the company's plan to extend it to white-collarworkers.   On Aug. 24, the USW and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workersunions broke off early contract negotiations with Alcoa afterrejecting offers that included profit-sharing, an immediateratification bonus, lump sum bonuses annually, an improved medialinsurance option and increased pension benefits.   USW negotiator George Becker said the talks ended because Alcoawould not address several key issues, including wage and pensionincreases.   The unions sought new contracts to recover concessionsnegotiated in 1986, when the aluminum industry faced difficulteconomic times.</TEXT></DOC>
