They have a widevariety and exist widely, but the utilization of their energy is muchrestricted due to the facts that in general they contain much water andhave small calorific value. This report describes the results of thesurvey by National Institute of Resources concerning the biomass resourcesin Japan, technologies of converting them to energy, and the currentsituation and problems concerning the utilization of such ehergy andthe examination of their utilization in the future. The amount of biomassresources in Japan which is convertable to energy is about 107,750,000t/a and its quantity of heat is 291 trillion Kcal in methane equivalent.The energy conversion processes include direct combustion, solid fuel( charcoal, pellet and solid compound fuel, etc. ), liquid fuel ( ethanol,colloidal fuel, and heavy oil produced by wood liquefaction, etc. ),gas fuel ( methane gas and thermal decomposition gas ), refuse furnacepower generation, and extraction of hydrocarbon. Hereafter, the developmentof energy utilization system and the feedstock transpotation and storagesystem,etc. is necessary. (17 figs, 36 tabs, 30 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
