 Vendors were grumpy andshowgoers apathetic.andP;  The only bright spot was at the Complementary Solutionsbooth, where a guy dressed up in a dog suit sang to passersby and made facesbehind the marketing person as he gave his spiel.andM;We did, by the way, cruise through the Fiber Tour show, where most of thevendors were showing fiber optic cabling and connectors.andP;  Ironically, nobodyseemed to be rattling the FDDI saber very loudly.andP;  Most of the FDDIproponents were at the Localnet show.andM;Commtex (Crofton, Md.) has reengineered the interface between the workstationand the 3174 cluster controller to support ISDN applications.andP;  At the show,an entire T-1 link connected each PC to what the company called a multimediaserver.andP;  Six timeslots from each PC were collected and forwarded to anassociated file server.andP;  The timeslots emulate a NetbIOS interface in theuser's PC, as demonstrated by a 10Net connection over the same unshieldedtwisted pair that carried two telephone circuits.andP;  One of the PCs wasconnected to a camera to demonstrate that a video source could be integratedinto the VGA display.andP;  Incoming telephone calls can be displayed, completewith calling party ID.andP;  Commtex offers a three-board set that upgrades a PCto multimedia capabilities.andP;  The basic Cx-Card establishes the 30 B + DPrimary Rate connection and may optionally host a Voice SubSystem (VSS).andP;  TheVSS implements its smart telephone features around the users choice of atwo-wire analog telephone set.andP;  The automatic answering feature digitizes andfiles messages under DOS on the user's PC or redirects them to a file server.andO;Three-party conferencing, directory driven dialing, and message logging areincluded in the $695 list price.andP;  The Cx-Card sells for $1,995 and the TVoption is $2,500 extra.andM;Our old friends at DCA/10Net (Dayton, Oh.) showed v. 4.1 of its 10Net networkoperating system.andP;  This upgrade relieves some of the RAM cram associated witha network operating system by loading 10Net into higher memory.andP;  The 10Netmethods to accomplish this include using Extended Memory Specification (EMS),which allows users to load 10Net in the first 64KB of memory above the 640KBDOS limit.andP;  386 user can load the code into the memory above the 64KB andbelow the 1MB limit.andP;  Third-party enhancement products providing high-memoryRAM between 640KB-1,024KB can also be used.andM;Users can take advantage of the network configuration selection feature.andO;10Net code can be configured to be from 80KB for a server to 29KB for aworkstation.andP;  There are three configurations.andP;  The Superstation/ Server,which uses 80KB, provides server functionality, data and peripheral sharing,and all networking utilities.andP;  The 55KB Workstation software providesworkstation capabilities and all network utilities.andP;  The Redirector softwareuses 28KB of memory and provides a connection to a server on the LAN.andM;10Net Plus 4.1 offers Netbios compatibility and Server Message Block (SMB)protocol support in a peer-to-peer system.andP;  The product is bundled withelectronic mail, user-to-user communications, network management, remote jobsubmission, calendaring and security features.andM;The software-only version for NetBIOS LANs is priced at $195 per node.andP;  Thehardware/software configurations range from $495 to $1,295 per node.andO;Existing customers can upgrade to v. 4.1 for $99 per machine.andM;Newbridge Networks (Herndon, Va.) showed PC Mac, a front end for its dataswitch that allows PCs and Macs to transfer files and perform othernetworking functions.andP;  Those who consider such networking to be low endshould know that no less an institution than Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology uses Newbridge products to network departments.andM;PC Mac, a version of the company's Dial-Net software, lets users gain networkaccess from within an application.andP;  The user pops up a program and selectsthe devide to be connected to an PC Mac makes the connection.andP;  Users can thentransfer data or send files to a printer.andP;  Users can also dial a modem orconfigure a printer before sending data.andP;  A PC-Phone feature allows users onthe network to hold interactive keyboard conversations.andM;PC Mac has a graphical interface on the Mac end and a menu-driven interfaceon the PC end.andP;  Users on any machine can browse through the other hard drivesand copy files or whole directories between the two.andP;  Directories copies fromDOS-based machines to the MacOS show up as folder icons and folders copiedfrom the Mac to the PC are listed as directories.andM;Files can be converted in the transfer or they can be left in their nativeformat.andP;  Users can run file transfers in the fore- or background and cancontinually check their transactions' progress.andM;PC Mac is priced at $995.andP;  The package includes the software, an eigh-portdata switch, connectors, and cabling.andP;  The software can be used with any ofthe company's data switches.andM;Contemporary Solutions (Atlanta, Ga.) was showing AutoMate, billed as &quot;yourPC's best friend,&quot; with the aid of a six-foot, furry, floppy-eared dancingdog.andP;  With AutoMate, Pc users can program their machine to execute routinetasks such as backup or batch jobs.andP;  Networked users can also communicatewith other devices on the network.andP;  Anything that can be done from the DOSprompt can be performed automatically with AutoMate.andP;  Tasks can be scheduledto run in any combination or time frame.andP;  Those jobs requiring additionalkeystrokes can be accommodated with AutoMate Macro.andP;  AutoMate costs $199.andO;With the Macro function it's priced at $249.andM;All in all, there were some exhibits and demonstrations worth seeing atLocalnet.andP;  But they were mostly along the lines of upgrades and improvementsand the bulk of the exhibitors seemed to be cable vendors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
