Had the Exxon Valdez spilled its oil off Antarctica instead ofAlaska, he said, ``it would take hundreds of years to repair thedamage.''   Cousteau, at a speech and news conference at the National PressClub, assailed a treaty adopted last year by the 39 signatorynations of the original Antarctic Treaty of 1961, which included theUnited States and Soviet Union.   ``Why should we needlessly pillage the last unspoiled area of ourplanet?'' he asked.   The so-called Wellington Convention, adopted in Wellington, NewZealand, would open Antarctica to mineral exploration anddevelopment, though stringent, if not insurmountable, environmentalguidelines would apply.   The treaty lacks an enforcement mechanism for the environmentalrules and Cousteau argues that ``once `careful' mining is allowed,careless mining can happen.''   The treaty is virtually dead already, despite backing by theReagan and Bush administrations, because France and Australia, twoof the seven nations with veto authority, have suspendedratification.   ``I am here because the United States is extremely important asthe nation which has done the most scientific research inAntarctica,'' Cousteau said. ``Accordingly, it has increasedresponsibility'' to discourage mineral exploration.   No one has demonstrated the commercial feasibility of miningAntarctica for oil or any other mineral resource. The bestpossibility, said Cousteau, ``is drilling for oil offshore _ theworst thing imaginable. To do that would present a far greaterdanger than it does in the North Sea.''   The dangers, he said, would apply both to the environment andthose who would attempt exploration.   ``We're talking about the harshest weather conditions in theworld. And that, sooner or later, would cause an inevitabledisaster,'' Cousteau said, citing heavy fog and dagger-like windsthat often reach 200 mph among the hazards.   After the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound last year,he said, ``4,000 people were sent to clean it up. Can you imagine4,000 people being sent to Antarctica? Certainly not.''   He said that the benign bacteria that act as nature's ownscrubbers of oil spills, even in the cold waters off Alaska, arevirtually non-existent in the harsher Antarctic climate.   Antarctica comprises 90 percent of the ice and 70 percent of thefresh water in the world, yet its climate is classified as desertbecause it receives less rain than the Sahara.   The frigid waters team with krill and plankton, icefish andsponges. Whales, seals, skuas, albatrosses and penguins also thrivewithin the continent's boundaries.   The continent already has endured pillaging. Long ago, crewsslaughtered more than half the seals and 90 percent of the whales.   Earlier this year, an Argentine supply ship ripped open its hullon a rock and spilled several tons of oil. Thousands of birds werekilled, and a small area of the sea was sterilized, jeopardizingscientific research at the U.S. Palmer Station.   The Antarctic Treaty of 1961 affirms that ``it is in the interestof all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be usedexclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene orobject of international discord.''   It did not specifically bar commercial exploitation of itsresources.</TEXT></DOC>
