The new agreement, retroactive to July 20, runs until Nov. 20, 1990. It covers about 50,000 members who load mail at shipping docks.    Under the contract, mail handlers will get wage increases averaging about 2% a year over the life of the contract. Members of the Postal Service's two larger unions, which together contain about 580,000 workers, haven't yet voted on a new contract to replace one that expired last month. </TEXT></DOC>
