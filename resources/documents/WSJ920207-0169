Top officials of the 13,000-member Financial ExecutivesInstitute, which represents financial officers of the largestcorporations, said in a letter to U.S. Rep. Ron Wyden that ithas dropped its objections to a proposed law sent to FEI bythe Oregon Democrat.</LP><TEXT>   If passed, the bill would require outside auditors toreport financial fraud to regulators if their clientcompanies failed to do so quickly.   This shift in support by FEI could persuade several keycongressmen to favor the bill this year, say some accountantsand executives. Similar provisions attached to an omnibusbanking bill failed to pass last year.   &quot;FEI shares your concern that there is a need to detectand to minimize the effects of financial fraud and relatedillegal acts,&quot; said P. Norman Roy, FEI's president, in aletter sent to Rep. Wyden earlier this month. &quot;FEI believesthat good controls are good business,&quot; he added.   In Washington, Rep. Wyden said he plans to introduce thebill, which he said would be co-sponsored by Rep. JohnDingell (D., Mich.) and Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), laterthis month. &quot;I'm glad that financial executives now recognizethat investors and the public must be protected from furtherfinancial abuses which have exacted a big toll on oureconomy,&quot; Rep. Wyden added.   The proposed bill drops a previous section that directedthe Securities and Exchange Commission to study whetherreports on internal controls by management and outsideauditors should be required. FEI strongly opposes suchreports.   While FEI supports the latest version of the bill, theAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants continuesto oppose a major part of it that would permit the SEC toprescribe auditing standards to detect financial fraud.   &quot;We believe such standards should continue to be left inthe private sector,&quot; said B.Z. Lee, deputy chairman of theinstitute, a unit of which has long set auditing standards.   Rep. Wyden said he doesn't intend to change the sectionopposed by the institute. &quot;Congress cannot continue to letthe accounting profession regulate itself in the wake ofrecent scandals at financial institutions,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
