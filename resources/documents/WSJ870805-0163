In fact, the department's position reflects a consistent position: encourage effective telecommunications industry competition.    At the time of the breakup, the department urged a set of restrictions on the former Bell companies to avoid a repeat of the problems of the pre-breakup days. These restrictions prevent the seven companies from competing in long distance, providing information services, manufacturing communications equipment, and entering certain other businesses.    Three years later the department hired an independent consultant, Dr. Peter Huber, to see how competition was faring. (This periodic review is part of the decree's terms.) His 1,200-page report showed that the restrictions now impede competition, domestically and internationally. Based on these findings, the department recommended that Judge Greene generally lift the restrictions, with certain provisos, particularly that the companies provide long-distance service only on a case-by-case basis.    The shift in the department's views is not a sign of uncertainty or political meddling, but its best response, based on independent counsel, to a rapidly evolving market. The department's submission is in keeping with the purpose of the decree review. It should be accorded substantial weight by the court in deciding how the evolution in telecommunications will proceed.
