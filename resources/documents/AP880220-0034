Shultztoday said the Soviet Union must ``face up'' to its human rightsproblems if it wants to participate in a Middle East peaceconference.   Shultz specifically cited restrictions on emigration andreligious practices, as well as a lack of diplomatic relations withIsrael.   ``So they have some work to do that will make their presence atan international conference more acceptable from our standpoint andIsrael's standpoint,'' Shultz told reporters on his Air Force jetflight from Washington.   The Middle East is one of the topics on his agenda for the talksShultz is to hold in Moscow Sunday with Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze and on Monday with General Secretary Mikhail S.Gorbachev and Shevardnadze.   Shultz is scheduled to go to the Middle East next week to try toset up negotiations between Israel and the Arabs. He seemeddoubtful that a peace conference would be the right framework.   ``What is an international conference supposed to do if there isone?'' Shultz said.   But, he added, if the Soviets ``continue to advocate seriouslyan international conference they have to face up to these problemsthat are posed by their lack of diplomatic presence in one of thekey parties, and the immigration and other problems that Imentioned.''   Shultz said he would not seek Soviet backing for his efforts.   ``We will talk around about the Middle East, but we are notasking them for anything,'' he said. ``I think it will be more inthe nature of information sharing.''   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union was nearly 800 people amonth April through September of last year. It rose to over 900monthly October through December. But in January, emigration dippedto about 650 to 700, and is at about the same rate this month.   Last year, applications were accepted from Jews who did not haverelatives in Israel, but on Jan. 1 the process was halted.   The Soviet Union broke relations with Israel after the 1967Mideast war, but sent a handful of diplomats to Tel Aviv last year.   Shultz said the Soviets had imposed ``unwarranted'' restrictionson emigration and on the practice of Judaism and other religions.``So they have some work to do,'' he said.   On another front, Shultz backed Pakistan's demand for acoalition government in Afghanistan. He said it would make ``acontribution'' to stability as Soviet troops withdrew from thecountry.   Shultz said the U.S.-backed Afghan rebels would propose ``newideas'' in Geneva when negotiations for a settlement resume March 2.   The Soviets last week said Pakistan was obstructing an end tothe eight-year war in the country by insisting that a change ofgovernment in Kabul precede the signing of a peace agreement.   Some 115,000 Soviet troops are in Afghanistan supporting thegovernment in its war with the guerrillas. On Feb. 8 Gorbachevoffered to begin a withdrawal on May 15 if an agreement is reached,and to carry it out over 10 months.   The negotiations are being conducted by Pakistan and Afghanistanunder the auspices of the United Nations.   The People's Democratic Party, which seized power in Kabul in1978, has presented its proposal for a future government to U.N.mediator Diego Cordovez. A U.S. official, who demanded anonymity,said it called for a dominant role for the Kabul regime.   Shultz said the United States would suspend its military aid tothe rebels provided the Soviets ``cease similar supplies to thegovernment forces.''   ``There has to be a symmetry there,'' Shultz said.</TEXT></DOC>
