In a 3-0 decision, the federal appeals court here ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to rewrite for a third time a portion of its smokestack rules. The rules allow companies to meet local air-pollution standards by relying partly on tall smokestacks that disperse pollution to help prevent high concentrations of emissions from being pulled to the ground by wind around buildings in a &quot;downwash&quot; effect.    The court said the EPA may have been too &quot;generous&quot; in giving certain smokestacks automatic credits for reducing air pollution. But it gave the EPA the option of keeping its current rules if it can better justify them.    The ruling applies mainly to large coal-fired power plants, but it also covers some oil-fired power plants and certain smelters, paper mills and industrial boilers.    The ruling wasn't a clear-cut victory for either the utility industry or environmental groups, which primarily were concerned about emissions of sulfur dioxide, a main component in acid rain.    Attorney Henry Nickel, who represented utilities in the case, said the EPA could satisfy the court simply by providing a better explanation for its current rules. He said utilities would be concerned if the agency writes more stringent standards that ultimately could force some to install expensive pollution control devices or to switch to lower-sulfur fuels.    In a major loss for the Natural Resources Defense Council and other environmental groups, the court refused to order that industry be required to use all feasible emission control techniques to meet clean-air standards before receiving credit for dispersion of pollution by smokestacks.    The new rules to be written by EPA will cover smokestacks replaced or raised in height after 1970 and &quot;combined stacks&quot; that are original equipment at plants built since 1970. Combined stacks are two or more boilers vent through a single stack.    David Hawkins, attorney for the council, says 168 large electric power units and 25 utilities with &quot;combined stacks&quot; could be affected. </TEXT></DOC>
