(HP), seems equipped to do just that.andM;The 48-year-old Puette joined HP in 1966.andP;  In 1977, he became marketingmanager for the Realtime Computers division.andP;  In 1979, he became generalmanager of the company's Computer Support Division, and in 1981 took thereigns of HP's PC Group.andM;HP's PCs subsequently earned a spot among the best-selling brands on themarket, according to Bruce Stephen, project analyst at market-research firmInternational Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.andP;  Last year, HP shipped 98,000PCs to capture a 1.3 percent market share, Stephen said.andM;Last fall, Puette's PC Group one-upped competitors when it announced the HPEISA 486 Vectra PC, the first PC to feature both Extended Industry StandardArchitecture (EISA) and Intel Corp.'s new 486 chip.andP;  Moreover, PC Week testsrevealed that the Vectra PC is more than a marketing coup; the machine outranIBM's Model 4381 mainframe and Compaq Computer Corp.'s Systempro server.andM;Such engineering and marketing synergy will be key to Puette's success atApple, according to Craig Kraff, an analyst at investment firm Edward D.andO;Jones andamp; Co. in St. Louis.andP;  Puette's primary responsibility will be toimplement a strategy outlined this spring by Apple's new chief operatingofficer, Michael Spindler -- but he alone will bear the onus of reversing thecompany's failure to compete at the low end of the market, Kraff said.andM;Puette sees integrating marketing with sales and support as his biggestchallenge.andP;  &quot;Apple has outstanding products and spends a lot of money onadvertising,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I see an opportunity to couple marketing and sales.&quot;andM;Although he wasn't Apple's first choice to replace Allen Loren as presidentof Apple USA (CEO John Sculley reportedly tried to recruit at least threetop-level Apple insiders), Puette has managed to impress others at thecompany.andM;&quot;He is a man of substance who attends to the basics,&quot; said Ian Diery,president of Apple Pacific in Cupertino, Calif.andP;  &quot;Bob will get the blockingand tackling done.&quot;andM;To analysts, he represents a breath of fresh air.andP;  &quot;It's a different crowd atApple than it was five years ago,&quot; said Barbara Isgur, vice president ofNeedham andamp; Co., an investment research firm in New York.andP;  &quot;[Puette] can getwork done without having a religious fervor about it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
