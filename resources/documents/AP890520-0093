(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   West German officials voiced optimismSaturday that a dispute with the United States over short-rangenuclear missiles would be settled in a way that maintained NATOunity.   The officials, attending a conference here on U.S.-West Germanrelations, said the administration had accepted the principle ofnegotiations with the Soviet Union over the missiles.   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Saturdaythat West Germany's proposal for resolving the dispute is too vagueand must be linked more closely with reductions in the WarsawPact's superiority in conventional forces.   Baker, speaking in Kennebunkport, Maine, said Washington hassent a counterproposal to Bonn and is awaiting a response.   West German officials said negotiations would be linked at someindefinite point to talks now under way in Vienna designed toreduce tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.   They would not be held until the Soviet-led alliance agreed tosizable reductions in its forces, the officials said.   The acceptance of negotiations at some point represented a majorconcession by the Bush administration. The West Germans, meanwhile,relented in their demands for ``speedy'' negotiations.   Baker on Saturday did not rule out eventual East-Westnegotiations on curbing short-range nuclear weapons, as Germany hasurged over opposition from the United States.   ``It's the view of our government that negotiations are amistake unless there are significant conditions with respectthereto,'' said Baker, who commented after President Bush andvisiting French President Francois Mitterrand held a round of talksat Bush's seaside vacation home.   Baker told reporters that Bonn's proposal calls for negotiationsat too early a stage, without significant progress in talks toreduce Warsaw Pact troops, tanks and other conventional forces.   Baker said the U.S. counterproposal envisions postponing until1992 a decision on deployment and production of missiles that havea greater range and are faster than the U.S.-produced Lancemissiles stationed in West Germany.   Helmut Schaefer, the West German deputy foreign minister, andother officials said the United States still wanted to rule out theoption of negotiating the elimination of all short-range nuclearmissiles in NATO and Warsaw Pact arsenals.   Schaefer said West Germany wanted to leave open the option ofgetting down to zero. ``We ought to see the circumstances before wegive up options,'' he said.   The U.S. terms for a compromise are to be taken up in BonnSunday by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher and Stoltenberg.   If the dispute is not settled it could disrupt the NATO summitmeeting to be held May 29-30 in Brussels, Belgium.   The U.S. terms included a major American concession. For months,the Bush administration had ruled out any negotiations with theSoviets over the missiles, saying they were essential to thedefense of Western Europe.   West Germany, backed by several other NATO countries, demandednegotiations and also opposed making NATO's missiles more powerful,as the Unied States, Britain and France wanted.   The potential compromise would permit improving the missiles,but by the time the work began arsenals might be reduced throughnegotiations _ or even eliminated, if West Germany has its way.   There are 88 U.S.-built Lance launchers with about 700single-warhead muclear missiles based in Western Europe, most ofthem in West Germany.   All the major West German political parties are united in thedemand for negotiations out of concern their country is thelikeliest battlefield in the event of a nuclear war in Europe.   Schaefer said Britain and France ``give us advice but don't havethe weapons'' on their soil.   Short-range nuclear missiles, which can have a range of up to300 miles, are designed to deter a Soviet attack.   But Schaefer, in a speech to the American-German conferencehere, said ``we have to reconsider our positions and our strategiesin NATO'' in response to arms control overtures of Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev.   He criticized the Bush administration, saying it was ``sittingback and discussing whether Gorbachev is going to fail or not.''   Schaefer said the missiles dispute with the United States hadproduced ``some irritations'' but that West Germany's support forNATO had not flagged.   At the same time, the deputy foreign minister said, it would bea mistake to foreclose the elimination of all NATO and Warsaw Pactshort-range missiles.   He said ``dramatic cuts'' in Warsaw Pact conventional forcescould make banning all ground-based short-range missiles feasible.   Schaefer said the Bush administration's initial opposition tonegotiations ``is not backed, if I follow the polls, by themajority of Americans.''   He said he was optimistic that the U.S. and West Germangovernments would work out ``a good compromise'' preserving NATOunity.   Schaefer and other West German officials said later the proposalpresented to Defense Minister Stoltenberg in Washington would delaymissile negotiations until the Warsaw Pact agreed to make sharpreductions in its non-nuclear forces.   Then, Schaefer said, the missile negotiations would begin in a``synchronized way'' that at this point did not have a fixed date.Initially, the West Germans had demanded the U.S.-Sovietnegotiations begin ``speedily.''   The conference here is sponsored by the American Council onGermany, a private group based in New York. It brought togethergovernment officials, educators, business executives andjournalists from the two countries.</TEXT></DOC>
