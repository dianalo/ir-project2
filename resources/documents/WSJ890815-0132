Now, as the director of corporate information systems, she has decided that that mess should be somebody else's problem. She hired Businessland Inc. to take over Kodak's personal-computer operations nationwide. She also hired International Business Machines Corp. to set up and operate a data-processing center that will take over the work -- and employees -- of four Kodak centers. And she is looking into hiring outsiders to run Kodak's software and telecommunications operations.    Kodak is in the photographic-products business, she says, not the computer business. She wants to deal with computer companies the same way she would deal with electric utilities or the phone company: She wants to be able to plug into a wall and have data come out.    Such thinking puts Kodak in the vanguard of a movement reshaping the computer industry. Hardware and software companies that have simply pushed the technology as hard and as fast as they could are finding that that isn't enough any longer. At the least, they must tailor their products better to customers' problems. And some companies are getting intimately involved with their customers' business -- such as the arrangement among IBM, Businessland and Kodak.    &quot;If you're going to deal with us,&quot; says Arnold Birenbaum, the general manager of Bank of America's information center, &quot;you're going to do it on our terms and come to understand our problems. We can't do business the way we did before.&quot;    Growth in spending on computers is slowing for many reasons -- including concern about a possible recession soon -- but some customers cite a more fundamental cause. Increasingly, they are bewildered by the rapid pace of technological change, and they hesitate to spend millions of dollars on equipment that might be obsolete next year. At the same time, they worry that they aren't making the best use of computers they already have.    While figuring out what to do, many have slowed their spending on equipment -- as the computer industry's generally weak first-half results indicate -- and increased their spending on services. Input Inc., a market-research firm in Mountain View, Calif., says the systems-integration business is growing 25% a year and will exceed $14.7 billion in five years, up from a robust $4.8 billion in 1988. Systems management -- a cousin of systems integration, in which a customer contracts with an outsider to run its computer operations -- will grow 20% annually and go to $11.9 billion in 1993 from about $4 billion in 1988, Input predicts. By contrast, even the fast-growing personal-computer industry is generally expected to grow by little more than 15% this year and more slowly thereafter.    &quot;Many companies are finding it impossible to keep up with the demands of providing training and solving the endless problems that come up when they try to operate their own computer system,&quot; says Naomi Karten, a computer consultant in Randolph, Mass. &quot;Companies are getting hopelessly bogged down running their own systems, and they are increasingly willing to pay the price to be relieved of these headaches, which show no signs of diminishing.&quot;    So is the federal government, the first big customer to contract out most of its computer operations. &quot;We aren't married to a single product line, and we can take advantage of new technology more quickly&quot; by farming out computer operations, says Robert J. Woods, director of information management for the Transportation Department, which hires Unisys Corp. to run its Washington computer center.    Many software developers and computer manufacturers already act as if they have switched smoothly to a services approach. It's a rare company whose marketing people don't say, in their most sincere voices, &quot;Our competitors sell boxes, but we sell solutions.&quot;    But these companies are still just feeling their way. For example, they have recently made impressive progress in image-processing, a hot area because it will let companies process huge volumes of documents far more efficiently than they currently can. Many computer makers have assumed that their customers would snap up such an innovation as quickly as possible. But none has put the pieces together in a way that many customers find compelling -- to the chagrin of computer companies such as Wang Laboratories, which has bet its future on image-processing.    &quot;We're on a plateau in use of technology, and it's going to take us a long time to move off it,&quot; says Larry Bacon, a senior vice president at Travelers Corp., an insurer sophisticated in data-processing technology. And Mr. Birenbaum of Bank of America believes that the ability to add complex but minor improvements does little for the average computer-using company. The computer industry, he says, shouldn't act as if it means much if &quot;one company is six months ahead of another on some feature that only 1% of our users would need anyway.&quot;    The customers' change of heart reflects a general change in corporate America over the past few years. Restructuring has forced companies to narrow their focus and to cut costs -- and then cut them further.    Hibernia Corp., the parent of Louisiana's largest bank, recently signed a Kodak-like agreement with IBM because it found that the mainframes that run its business require constant, expert and costly attention. In addition, computer technology is changing so fast that keeping up with it is a full-time job. A Hibernia spokesman -- who described the agreement as a utility contract, &quot;almost as if we were buying power or phone service&quot; -- says the cost savings will be &quot;substantial.&quot;    Kodak's Ms. Hudson -- who is sending pink socks to the IBMers who worked with her to show that their offer, well, knocked her socks off -- says more than 1,000 people could be moved off her payroll if related operations are, in fact, handed over to outsiders. She figures that Kodak would have had difficulty keeping them anyway.    Competition for skilled people is stepping up, and, she says, &quot;if you're a really good technical person, do you think you'll have your best career at a photography company or a computer company?&quot; Perhaps reflecting that, many of the 275 employees going over to IBM put &quot;Welcome to IBM Country&quot; signs on their desks.    Similarly, Bill Shannon, director of planning and information resources at Pitney Bowes's business-systems operation, says that having outsiders handle software training and support lets him provide expertise to users that he couldn't afford on his own. He says that a few years ago, when Pitney Bowes was upgrading from one version of Lotus 1-2-3 to another, controllers and analysts in the different divisions would often find that they couldn't combine their spreadsheets because they had used different versions.    &quot;That got pretty screwy for a while,&quot; Mr. Shannon says. He has turned the mess over to Corporate Software Inc., a Westwood, Mass., company with an upgrade-coordinating program that ironed out the problem. (IBM, in turn, has decided to get out of the postal business and has turned over to Pitney Bowes some mailroom operations.)    As the shift to services continues, major computer makers may face new competition. Customers wary of handing over their computer operations to computer makers are turning instead to the growing number of independent firms specializing in weaving together hybrid systems from competing manufacturers.    Andersen Consulting, a unit of the Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. accounting firm, sees its computer-services revenue growing to more than $1.4 billion in its Aug. 31 fiscal year, from about $1.05 billion last year. Electronic Data Systems, a computer-services pioneer acquired by General Motors Corp. in 1984, posted 30% revenue growth in its non-GM business last year. And the giant Bell telephone companies, which have been forbidden by court order from building computer equipment, are pushing into services in a big way.    Michael Keen, Tandem Computer's director of internal PC support, has seen some immediate benefits in an increasingly service-oriented approach by his suppliers. Tandem, with 6,000 personal computers on its own employees' desktops, has taken advantage of training and field-support services that cost less -- and cause fewer headaches -- than a traditional company-sponsored program. Tandem, he says, is demanding that suppliers &quot;provide us with more comprehensive services. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there right now, and they are responding.&quot;    John Oltman, director of Andersen's systems-integration unit, concludes that the drive to systems integration and management &quot;is fundamentally transforming the computer industry into a more service-oriented industry rather than one driven purely by products or technology.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
