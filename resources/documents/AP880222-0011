At least 74 people died and 11,000 were left homeless by theviolent storms since Friday, which turned streets into ragingtorrents, threw cars like toys and carried ramshackle homes roaringdown hillsides, civil defense officials said early Monday.   Authorities estimated 50,000 people eventually may have to berelocated. Throughout the city, army trucks and volunteers helpedtransport slum dwellers from precarious hillside homes to temporaryshelters in schools, churches and public buildings.   In some cases, people refused to leave their partially destroyedhomes, preferring to ris being crushed beneath their homes thanleave their worldly possession   Health officials promised mass vaccinations against tetanus andtyphoid and warned residents against an outbreak of leprosy, whichfollowed a similar spate of rainstorms earlier this month.   ``From above, one has the impression a giant stepped through thecity, smashing homes and hillsides,'' said Mayor Saturnino Braga,who called the three-day onslaught the city's worst disaster.   Civil defense officials estimated Saturday that as many as 150people were killed in the rains that began late Friday, but thefigure on Sunday lowered to 48 and later raised back to 74.   Twenty more people were believed missing beneath mud and debris,including at least eight more people at the Santa Genovevahospital. Rescuers recovered the eight bodies and 13 people alivefrom the nursing home in the upscale hillside neighborhood of SantaTeresa, where a three-story wing of the hospital was crushed by amudslide Saturday.   ``It's hard to have an accurate view of the number of dead,''said civil defense spokesman Bruno Avila. ``We have no idea howmany people have been burried by their shanty town homes nor do weknow exactly how many were in the Santa Genoveva hospital at thetime it was stuck, though we imagine some 30 of the 350 patientsdied.''   Torrents raged down streets throughout the city, prompting somepeople to tie their cars to posts to prevent them from being sweptaway. Civil defense workers used amphibious vehicle and surfboardsto pluck people from partially submerged cars.   Rivers and drainage canals overflowed, pushing dozens of shantyhomes from their precarious hillside perches.   Much of the damage was inflicted on the slums that hold about 2million of the city's 7 million residents, but wealthy areas alsosuffered heavy damage.   In the Santa Teresa district, an eight-floor apartment buildingwas evacuated and threatened to topple, engineers said. Evacuationswere ordered after flooding hit the wealthy Gavea, Lagoa and JardimBotanico districts.   Vice Mayor Jo Rezende said he has asked the federal governmentfor $4 million to clean up city streets, relocate slum dwellers andrepair embankments and streets washed away by the waters.   ``I can't even imagine what will happen to this city if therains continue,'' Rezende told the Jornal do Brasil radio. ``Thesituation is desperate. We estimate 50,000 people will have to begiven new housing in safer areas.''   Public schools were used as shelter for the estimated 10,000homeless, Avila said. Supermarkets were asked to donate food anddoctors were asked to report for duty.   Globo, the country's biggest private television network, carriednews flashes every 15 minutes to solicit donations of time, foodand medication.   Meteorologists said the downpour was caused by an Antarctic coldfront that likely was to continue through Monday.   Health Secretary Jose Noronha told Rio residents to boil theirdrinking water and said the government would carry out vaccinationsagainst typhoid and tetanus. He said 69 people had beenhospitalized since the beginning of the month with leprosy, adisease carried by rats and contaminated water.   Five have died of the disease, Noronha said on Jornal do Brasilradio.   Earlier this month, 207 people died in flooding and mudslidesaround the state and 13,000 were left homless. The worst-hit areawas Petropolis, a mountain resort town 40 miles north of Rio.</TEXT></DOC>
