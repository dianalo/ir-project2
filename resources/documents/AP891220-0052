AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. troops fought Panamanian forcesearly Wednesday in a bid to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,surrounding his headquarters in a blaze of cannon and machine-gunfire. Opposition leader Guillermo Endara proclaimed himselfpresident.   ``We have many dead and wounded caused by the attack on the cityof Panama,'' national radio said.   An doctor at the city's Santo Tomas Hospital said there wereabout 50 dead at the hospital and hundreds wounded. It was unclearhow many of the victims were civilians and how many were soldiers.   Noriega's whereabouts were not known. However, Maj. EdgardoLopez, head of the Panamanian Defense Forces' press office, said onMexican television that Noriega had been warned and was safe inanother part of the country.   ``They (U.S. forces) have destroyed the headquarters becausethey thought Noriega was there,'' Lopez said. ``General Noriega isin another part of the country and is on top of the situation.''   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announcedU.S. troops were on a mission ``to apprehend Manuel Noriega.''   ``We are there to apprehend him and bring him back to America toprosecute him,'' he said.   Late Tuesday, mortar, machine-gun and cannon fire echoed acrossthe capital as truckloads of American troops headed from U.S.military bases toward the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters.   ``We're kicking ass tonight,'' said one U.S. soldier who stoppedreporters along a road about two miles north of the headquarters.   The Britich Broadcasting Corp. reported Wednesday morning thatthe headquarters was in flames.   By 3:45 a.m., the fighting in Panama City generally had quieteddown although there was sporadic gunfire, including the booming ofartillery and anti-aircraft fire.   The main fighting appeared to take place around the defenseheadquarters at the western tip of Panama City, in the poor anddensely populated neighborhood of El Chorillo.   Fighting also was reported near Paitilla, a small airstrip alongthe coast three miles to the east of the headquarters; near theMarriott Hotel, about six miles east of the headquarters; at FortCimarron, just over 20 miles east of the city; in Colon, 50 milesto the north; and near an airport in Chiriqui, about 200 miles tothe west.   On Tuesday night, planes and helicopters roared over PanamaCity. At the Marriot hotel on the capital's eastern edge, armedPanamanians took 12 foreigners hostage.   Among them were three reporters, including from The AssociatedPress, the New York Times and the Reuters news agency. They werereleased unhurt about two hours later.   ``A lot of Panamanians have died and we could kill you. Don'tthink they won't,'' one of the Panamanians told the New York Timesreporter.   CBS said there was a report of a fire at the U.S. Embassy.   The United States has tried to oust Noriega with economic andpolitical pressure since he was indicted on federal drugtrafficking charges in February 1988. U.S. sanctions depressed theeconomy, but did not budge Noriega, and two coup attempts _ mostrecently in October _ failed to unseat him.   Noriega has denied the drug charges and claims the United Stateswanted him out so it could renege on 1977 treaties that cedecontrol of the Panama Canal by the year 2000.   U.S. troops in Panama had been on maximum alert and restrictedto base since a U.S. Marine lieutenant was killed by Panamanians onSaturday in what American officials called an unprovoked incident.   On Tuesday, U.S. military transports flooded into American basesin the country.   Early Wednesday, government-controlled radio said, ``The generalheadquarters is being bombarded with heavy artillery ... We arebeing invaded by U.S. troops in a synchronized plan.''   A man on the 16th floor of a building with a view of themilitary headquarters in the poor residential neighborhood of ElChorillo said: ``El Chorillo is in flames,'' he said. ``You can seea mountain of flares.''   Two ambulances were seen heading for Fort Clayton, a U.S. base,from the combat zone near Defense Forces headquarters about an hourafter the fighting began under a full moon.   In a radio broadcast shortly after the fighting broke out atabout midnight Tuesday, Endara called on Panamanian forces tosurrender peacefully and accept his electoral victory in May 7balloting.   Those elections were annulled by Noriega.   ``Men of honor of the Defense Forces will have an important rolein a democratic Panama that will belong to all Panamanians,'' saidEndara.   Radio Nacional, the national radio station, was still undercontrol of Noriega loyalists and broadcast an appeal for alldoctors to go to Santo Tomas hospital, a hospital on Panama Bayabout two miles east of the Panamanian Defense Headquarters andnear the U.S. Embassy.   It said the headquarters had been ``cruelly bombarded.''   Fighting also was reported east of the Marriott, about sevenmiles east of the headquarters, where a Panamanian cavalry unit isbased.   An Associated Press reporter saw 24 armored personnel carriersand at least seven trucks carrying American troops head in thedirection of Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters.   U.S. soldiers surrounding the main Panamanian militaryinstallations yelled over megaphones for the Panamanian troops tosurrender, residents living near the installations said.   The Soviet news agency Tass, reporting from Panama City, said:``Panamanian radio is reporting that military planes andhelicopters of the U.S. Air Force are bombing the central part ofPanama ... At different points of the Panamanian capital armedclashes have begun between American and Panamanian units.''   ``There is all kinds of hell loose out there,'' three youngPanamanian soldiers told an AP reporter.   Channel 8, television station of the U.S. Southern Command,issued an Echo level alert, its highest, and said movement byunauthorized U.S. personnel was prohibited.   The United States has 12,000 troops based near the Panama Canal.   The Panamanian Defense Forces, controlled by Noriega, come toabout 15,000 men. Noriega also has armed citizen ``DignityBattalions'' of his loyalists.   Further aggravating tensions after Saturday night's shooting ofthe American, another U.S. Army officer wounded a Panamanianpoliceman because he thought the man was about to draw a weapon,according to Southern Command.   On Tuesday evening, a New York Times reporter and a Reutersreporter were detained for about an hour by U.S. military policewhen they tried to enter Howard air base to determine whether U.S.forces were landing.   The Times reporter's notebooks were confiscated by the U.S.Army, the Times said in New York, and the two reporters werereleased without incident.   The Panama attack was the first U.S. military invasion ofanother nation since Oct. 25, 1983, when a U.S.-led force invadedGrenada, southernmost of the Caribbean Sea's Windward Isles, sixdays after Marxist Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was executedfollowing a coup by radical army officers.   More than than 6,000 U.S. soldiers participated in the assault,which cost the lives of 19 Americans, 42 Cubans building an airporton the island and 24 Grenadian civilians. All U.S. troops have leftthe island.</TEXT></DOC>
