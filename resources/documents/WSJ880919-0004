The main impetus for the renewed Canadian dollar strength is the improved political fortunes of the ruling Conservative party and the country's attractive interest rate. If public opinion polls continue to reinforce the likelihood of a Conservative re-election victory, the Canadian currency is expected to move higher, analysts say.    Graham Sweet, vice president of foreign exchange trading at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, expects the Canadian dollar to weaken briefly once an election is actually called, but if and when a Conservative victory becomes imminent, then &quot;84 U.S. cents is a given . . . possibly 86 cents.&quot;    The Canadian dollar was quoted late Friday at 81.75 U.S. cents, up about 1.1 cents on the week, even as the U.S. dollar rose against currencies of other major trading partners.    Last week's shift in sentiment toward the Canadian dollar was triggered by the release of public opinion polls showing the Conservatives moving into the lead in voter popularity. An election is expected to be called soon by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and a Conservative victory would ensure Canadian passage of a free-trade treaty with the U.S.    Meanwhile, Canadian short-term interest rates have been rising steadily but, until last week, &quot;The market was ignoring the widening interest rate spreads&quot; and concentrating on the threat to the freetrade pact indicated by poor showings until now of the Conservatives in public opinion polls, according to one dealer. Both opposition parties are against the agreement.    The yield on 91-day Canada Treasury bills is currently about 10.2%, compared with 8.5% at the beginning of the year. The Canadian economy has been booming, and Finance Minister Michael Wilson told the House of Commons this week that the Bank of Canada is tightening credit to fight inflationary pressures. &quot;If you wait to act on inflation until you have a serious problem, you've lost the battle,&quot; Mr. Wilson said.    That firm inflation-fighting policy has widened the spread between Canadian and U.S. rates. Canadian Treasury bill rates are now about 3.1 percentage points above U.S. rates, compared with a spread of 2.6 points in January and a low this year of 2.4 points in early August.    Robert Burgess, general manager of foreign exchange trading at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said the Bank of Canada's tight money policy is a good opportunity for foreign investors. &quot;The spread against the U.S. remains attractive, and there's nothing in the near future to change that,&quot; he said.    The Canadian dollar peaked at about 83.50 U.S. cents in mid-July and fell steadily to just below the 81-cent level in late August. The bearishness was prompted by the Canadian Senate, an appointed body dominated by Liberals, pledging to stall any vote on enabling legislation for the Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement until after a federal election. The legislation cleared the House of Commons on Aug. 31 and only requires Senate approval to become law. The agreement is expected to clear the U.S. Congress shortly.    Both the opposition Liberals, who until recently have been leading the public opinion polls, and New Democrats have vowed to scuttle the free-trade deal if they attain power or hold the balance of power in a minority government.    &quot;Just the threat of the Liberals or the NDP getting elected and squashing the free-trade bill&quot; had sent the Canadian dollar lower in recent weeks, said Mr. Sweet.    However, the latest Gallup Poll gives the Conservatives 37% of decided voters, with the Liberals and New Democrats at 33% and 27%, respectively. Another poll by Environics Research confirmed the Gallup result. Both polling organizations had the Conservatives trailing slightly in recent months.    Michael Bowick, senior foreign exchange trader at Royal Bank of Canada, said the Canadian dollar's gain was simply &quot;a question of the market in general being short the Canadian dollar. It was oversold.&quot;    The Canadian dollar's rise last week was further reinforced by the country's trade figures for July, which were &quot;at the high end of expectations,&quot; Toronto-Dominion's Mr. Burgess said. The trade surplus in that month widened to C$1.5 billion (US$1.23 billion) from C$1.4 billion in June.    Traders agree that the Bank of Canada will continue its longstanding policy of intervening in foreign exchange markets only to slow any sharp movements in the Canadian dollar, whether up or down. &quot;There's no magic level that the Bank of Canada is looking at&quot; before it intervenes, said Mr. Burgess.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The U.S. dollar ended mixed, capping a week in which the market's dollar bulls succumbed to the wishes of U.S. and West German finance officials for stability in exchange rates.    As New York dealers were heading home, the dollar was quoted at 1.8709 marks, off from 1.8741 marks in New York late Thursday. The dollar was also quoted at 134.08 yen, gaining from 133.93 yen in New York late Thursday.    The U.S. unit fell back slightly against the mark late in the session as dealers in Chicago's International Money Market covered short positions ahead of the weekend. Dealers in New York added that many of their number were also peeling back long dollar-short mark positions in anticipation of further dollar losses early Monday.    The U.S. currency has gained 1.2% against the mark since being quoted at 1.8493 marks Sept. 9 in New York. But the bulk of these gains came in the three hours following the release of the July U.S. merchandise trade report last Wednesday, when the dollar jumped from 1.8550 marks to around 1.8750 marks. Since then, trading in the U.S. unit has been confined to a narrow range.    The dollar inched up in early trading Monday against the yen, having opened at 134.00 yen, up 0.24 yen.    In the latest call for calm, West German Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg warned against further volatility, saying in a news agency interview Friday that &quot;a stronger deviation of the dollar exchange rate from the present level would cause renewed problems in the fields of interest rates, prices and trade for us and our partner countries.&quot;    Mr. Stoltenberg's remarks served to underline the general message that traders have been receiving from finance officials for the past few weeks: The governments and central banks of West Germany and the U.S. are determined to keep the dollar steady, no matter what the cost to treasury coffers.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery dropped $6.90 to $411.70 ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate to heavy 4.5 million ounces.    In Hong Kong, gold was quoted Monday at $411.50.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Friday, September 16, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
