Statesor areas that do not meet the minimum standards for Class C are requiredto be placed under Federal quarantine. The brucellosis Class Free classification is based on a finding of no knownbrucellosis in cattle for the 12 months preceding classification as ClassFree. The Class C classification is for States or areas with the highestrate of brucellosis. Class B and Class A fall between these two extremes.Restrictions on moving cattle interstate become less stringent as a Stateapproaches or achieves Class Free status. The standards for the different classifications of States or areas entailmaintaining (1) a cattle herd infection rate not to exceed a stated levelduring 12 consecutive months; (2) a rate of infection in the cattle population(based on the percentage of brucellosis reactors found in the Market CattleIdentification (MCI) program_a program of testing at stockyards, farms,ranches, and slaughtering establishments) not to exceed a stated level;(3) a surveillance system that includes testing of dairy herds, participationof all slaughtering establishments in the MCI program, identification andmonitoring of herds at high risk of infection_including herds adjacentto infected herds and herds from which infected animals have been soldor received, and having an individual herd plan in effect within a statednumber of days after the herd owner is notified of the finding of brucellosisin a herd he or she owns; and (4) minimum procedural standards for administeringthe program. Before the publication of this interim rule, Kentucky was classified asa Class B State because of its herd infection rate and its MCI reactorprevalence rate. However, after reviewing its brucellosis program records,we have concluded that the State of Kentucky meets the standards for ClassA status. To attain and maintain Class A status, a State or area must (1) not exceeda cattle herd infection rate, due to field strain <T3>Brucella abortus </T3>of 0.25 percent or 2.5 herds per 1,000 basedon the number of reactors found within the State or area during any 12consecutive months, except in States with 10,000 or fewer herds; (2) maintaina 12 consecutive months MCI reactor prevalence rate not to exceed one reactorper 1,000 cattle tested (0.10 percent); and (3) have an approved individualherd plan in effect within 15 days of locating the source herd or recipientherd. Therefore, we are removing Kentucky from the list of Class B States inandSection; 78.41(c) and adding it to the list of Class A States in andSection;78.41(b). This action relieves certain restrictions on moving cattle interstatefrom Kentucky. <ITAG tagnum="84">Immediate Action </ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that there is good cause to publish this interimrule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action iswarranted to remove unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movementof cattle from Kentucky.Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under theseconditions, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effectiveupon signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 daysof publication of this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. After the comment period closes, we will publishanother document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, including discussion of any comments we receiveand any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. Cattle moved interstate are moved for slaughter, for use as breeding stock,or for feeding. Changing the status of Kentucky from Class B to Class Areduces certain testing and other requirements governing the interstatemovement of cattle from Kentucky. However, cattle from certified brucellosis-freeherds moving interstate are not affected by this change. The principal group affected would be the owners of noncertified herdsin Kentucky not known to be affected with brucellosis seeking to sell cattle.There are an estimated 60,000 herds in Kentucky, most of which are ownedby small entities, that potentially would be affected by this rule. Lastyear Kentucky tested 379,121 eligible cattle at saleyards alone, to qualifycattle for sale in lieu of ``S'' branding and sales to quarantined feedlots.This testing costs approximately $3 per head or $1,140,000. Since herdsizes vary, larger herds will accumulate more savings than smaller herds.Also, not all herd owners will choose to market their cattle in a way thataccrues these cost savings. The overall effect of this rule on small entitiesshould be to provide very small economic benefit. Therefore, we believe that changing Kentucky's brucellosis status willnot significantly affect market patterns, and will not have a significanteconomic impact on the small entities affected by this interim rule. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials.
