Studies to date have assessed the available technicaldata of several innovative combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, and liquidfuel synthesis processes being developed to produce electricity, medium-Btugas, synthetic natural gas, and liquid fuels from biomass. These processesoffer potential to produce products with considerable economic value.</TEXT></DOC>
