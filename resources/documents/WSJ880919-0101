Stock Leaps on Rumor Of a Takeover </HL><AUTHOR> Laura Landro (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TL </CO><IN> TNM PUB </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Time Inc.'s stock price leaped on rumors that the company might be a takeover target or is considering a management-led leveraged buy-out.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Time closed Friday at $106.625, up $9.375, on volume of more than 570,000 shares.    A Time spokesman said the company had no news and doesn't comment on market rumors. But company executives dismissed the market activity as purely speculative and said there are no plans for a management-led buy-out.    Analysts and arbitragers said the stock began trading heavily on reports that Time retained buy-out consultants Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co. But that isn't new; Time was among the first companies to sign on with the new firm after its principals split from First Boston Co. earlier this year. &quot;We have used Wasserstein Perella in the past and we use other investment bankers as well,&quot; the Time spokesman said.    Recent activity in other publishing stocks also seems to be affecting Time, including the takeover battle for Macmillan Inc. and recurring rumors that McGraw-Hill Inc. is a target.    At current prices, it would take more than $6 billion to buy Time. But the company has been valued by analysts at more than $150 a share, and a takeover or buy-out at that price would cost $8.7 billion or more. &quot;It's not that no one can come up with that kind of money, but you haven't seen any unfriendly deals on well-run major media companies,&quot; said John Reidy, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
