Since plans were unveiled last year to eliminate ownership restrictions in Canada's securities industry, the country's large firms have sought investments from financial institutions to bolster their small capital bases. But few deals have been signed because selling prices are high and firms are reluctant to surrender control.    In agreeing to pay $200 million for 35% of Wood Gundy, First Chicago, through its First National Bank of Chicago (Canada) unit, offered a healthy premium over the firm's book value of 125 million Canadian dollars ($94 million) while leaving control with its partners. Lawrence W. Cohn, an analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said First Chicago is paying &quot;a high price for what they are getting.&quot; He figures that the bank is paying nearly four times the book value of Wood Gundy for its stake, compared with the going price for U.S. brokerages of twice book value or a little higher.    Retaining control is a priority for most Canadian securities dealers. &quot;We were not going to do a deal in which we would be perceived as the regional operation of a large international bank,&quot; said Edward Medland, chairman of Wood Gundy.    The resistance to takeovers largely reflects the protection Canadian securities firms have enjoyed from foreign bidders for the past 16 years. &quot;Complete takeovers are going to come very gradually in Canada,&quot; said Tony Fell, chairman of Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd., because &quot;we're not prepared to give up our independence.&quot;    Wood Gundy will move ahead of Dominion as Canada's largest securities dealer when First National completes the transaction. Dominion recently broke off discussions with potential buyers, Mr. Fell said, because of disputes over price and control.    Many international financial companies have been frustrated by Canadian concerns about foreign domination. &quot;Canadian dealers may think they are for sale, but they're not,&quot; said Michael Sanderson, chairman of Merrill Lynch's Canadian unit.    The Merrill unit broke off discussions to merge with Burns Fry Ltd. after they failed to resolve disputes about the U.S. parent's control of the new firm. Mr. Sanderson said the unit hasn't any plans to buy another Canadian firm.    Securities dealers may face increasing pressure to link up with foreign companies. As of yesterday, Canadian and foreign financial companies are now allowed to fully operate in the nation's securities industry. Many Canadian banks and foreign securities firms have chosen to operate their own subsidiaries in Canada and concentrate their business in underwriting new equity issues.    &quot;The underwriting business is not going to make any money over the next little while,&quot; said A.S. Thompson, an analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc.'s Canadian unit.    ---   Scott McMurray in Chicago contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
