Leonard Strickland, 49, an attorney, and the Rev. Ronald G.Carson, 40, were arrested Thursday at their Detroit homes and laterreleased on $500,000 bond each, the FBI said.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Mendeloff said the two were to betransported to Chicago after a May 27 hearing before a U.S.magistrate in Detroit.   Narly $20 million had not been returned to First National byThursday. However, officials at the nation's 10th-largest bankinsisted that neither the bank nor the three corporate customerswhose accounts were involved would lose any money as a result ofthe sophisticated wire-transfer scheme to transfer money to twoAustrian banks.   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said one Austrian bank,Creditanstalt, through Citibank, its New York correspondent bank,returned the $49 million transferred from the First Nationalaccounts of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and United Airlines.   But Focobank of Austria and its correspondent bank in New York,Chase Manhattan, had not returned $19.75 million transferred fromthe First National account of Brown-Foreman Corp., a Louisville,Ky.-based distiller.   First National filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Focobank, andU.S. District Judge Vincent Broderick issued an order freezingFocobank's account. He also set a May 25 hearing on the matter.   Prosecutors said two First National employees provided theschemers with confidential code words and security information,enabling them to transfer the $70 million on May 13 to the New Yorkbanks, and then into the accounts of the two Austrian banks.   On Monday, an executive in United Airline's finance divisionfound a ``substantial overdraft'' in reviewing account transactionsfrom the previous Friday and notified First National, which in turnalerted federal authorities.   Four of the other suspects are being held in a federal detentioncenter, while the fifth, a bank employee, is cooperating withauthorities and is not being held.</TEXT></DOC>
