Retaining members are also provided      with the frame to hold the substrate against the leads. The retaining      member is preferably disengaged from the substrate simultaneously with the      trimming of the leads from the frame after connecting to the substrate. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates generally to lead arrangement and methods for      applying leads to a circuit-bearing substrate. More specifically, the      invention relates to a frame for applying leads to integrated circuit      chips or chip carriers and methods of producing and applying such lead      arrangement. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  To manufacture an integrated-circuit device, it is necessary to combine two      components--the substrate, which could, for example, be an integrated      circuit (IC) chip or a chip carrier, and a number of leads that create      connections between the substrate and the surrounding electronics. The      leads are connected to the substrate at its contact pads, which are      exposed electrically conductive areas, usually at the periphery of one      face of the substrate. </PAR><PAR>  The speed at which the leads are attached to the substrate is a paramount      consideration in the manufacturing process, as higher throughput and thus      lower costs can provide the economy needed for successfully meeting      competition. Technologies have been designed to attempt to speed the      process. A process in common use includes forming a frame with a number of      individual leads spaced to correspond to contact pads on the substrate.      Solder is then applied to the contact pads on the substrate or the leads.      The frame is positioned adjacent the substrate, putting the leads in      juxtaposition or direct contact with respective contact pads. In order to      hold the leads in contact with their pads during soldering, the substrate      is pressed onto the leads. Unfortunately, this can sometimes crack the      substrate, which renders it unusable. While being held under pressure, the      frame/substrate assembly is heated, causing the solder to melt and, upon      cooling, creates an electrical and physical connection between the leads      and the substrate. </PAR><PAR>  Typically, heat is applied to the underside of the leads for three to four      seconds, melting the solder, which flows between the contact pads and the      leads. To prevent movement of the leads while the solder remains in a      liquid state, which could result in misalignment and misconnection of the      leads, a support and clamp remain in position, holding the components in      place until the solder has sufficiently cooled. Typically, this may take      about fifteen seconds. Overall, this process requires that a particular      lead frame and substrate remain at the soldering station for about 20      seconds. </PAR><PAR>  After soldering is completed, the lead frame is cut away, leaving the ends      of the leads extending from the periphery of the substrate, ready for      connection to surrounding electronic devices. </PAR><PAR>  The time required at the soldering station for each substrate makes the      manufacturing speed and thus the throughput undesirably low for      competitive production. Also, the substantial risk of cracking a substrate      and having to completely discard the unit adds to the costs involved. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide a lead frame that      decreases the time the frame and substrate must remain at a soldering      station. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the invention to provide a lead frame that includes      means for retaining a substrate against the lead frame while the solder      cools, without risk of damaging the substrate. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of the invention to provide a lead frame including      means for retaining a substrate against the frame where the retaining      means is readily removed at the end of the manufacturing process. </PAR><PAR>  It is yet another object of the invention to provide a lead frame that is      economical to fabricate and produces significant savings in applying leads      to substrates, in decreased time. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the objects of the invention, a lead frame is provided      having a number of leads to be mechanically and electrically connected to      a substrate. Retaining means are also provided on the frame to hold the      substrate against the leads during soldering and subsequent cooling. The      retaining means is preferably disengaged from the substrate simultaneously      with the trimming of the leads from the frame. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing and other objects and advantages of this invention will      become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description      of a preferred embodiment in conjunction with a review of the appended      drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a top view of a fragment of a conductive strip having a prior art      lead frame; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a top view of a portion of a strip of lead frames according to      the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a top view of an individual lead frame according to the      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a side view of a lead frame with retaining arms prepared to      receive a substrate; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a side detail view of the retaining means according to the      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a top view of a lead frame/substrate assembly with the retaining      arms engaged to the substrate; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a side view of an alternate embodiment of a lead frame according      to my invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram showing the preferred method of use of the      lead frame according to the invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  In the situation where a square or rectangular substrate is to be provided      with leads, a correspondingly spaced series of square or rectangular lead      frames 11 has been provided in the prior art, as shown in FIG. 1, stamped      from a continuous strip of metal. Each frame 11 has a central opening 13,      with individual leads 15 extending inwardly from each side of the rim of      the frame 11. The number and spacing of the leads 15 corresponds to the      number and spacings of the conductive areas of the substrate to which the      leads 15 are to be soldered. </PAR><PAR>  In a known process, the contact pads of the substrate are supplied with a      solder paste. The substrate is placed on the set of leads 15, as shown by      the dotted lines a in FIG. 1, with the contact pads of the substrate      resting on the ends of the leads 15. A pressure clamp is applied to hold      the substrate in position relative to the frame, while heat is applied,      either through the substrate or the leads, to melt the solder. The clamp      must hold the frame/substrate assembly in locked position until the solder      first melts and then cools to solidify, a cycle typically taking 15 to 20      seconds. Only after the solder solidifies can the frame/substrate assembly      be moved out of the clamp at the soldering station. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 2 of the drawings, a portion of a strip 10 carrying      lead frames 12 according to the invention is shown. The individual lead      frames 12 can be delineated by indexing holes 14 that are used by a      conveyor or indexing apparatus (not shown) to move the strip 10      successively by a fixed distance corresponding to the frame length. Each      individual lead frame 12 preferably is comprised of a number of leads 16      surrounding and extending into an interior opening 18. Extending outward      from each side of each frame is a retaining arm, shown as a handle-like      projection 20. As shown below, when a substrate 22 is placed on the leads      16, the retaining arms 20 may be engaged to the substrate 22 to hold the      substrate 22 in place. This will be shown to be particularly useful to      hold the substrate 22 in place while previously molten solder cools to      form a physical and electrical bond between the substrate 22 and the leads      16. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 3, an individual lead frame 12 is shown in greater detail. The      frame 12 may be fashioned in any shape to accommodate and match a      particular substrate. In the illustrated embodiment, the frame 12 is      provided with a square aperture 18, into which extend a number of integral      leads 16, which are integral with the frame 12 at their proximal ends. </PAR><PAR>  As described below, the leads 16 extending inwardly from the four sides of      the frame 12 create a support for a substrate 22, which will fit in the      position marked by the broken line A. The substrate 22 may be any      component having at least one conductive area or pad 24, such as an      integrated circuit chip or chip carrier or printed circuit board. The      leads 16 are positioned and designed such that the distal ends 26 of the      leads 16 will be adjacent to respective conductive pads 24 on the      substrate 22 when the substrate 22 rests at position A. </PAR><PAR>  Each individual lead frame 12 also includes retaining arms 20, which      preferably extend outwardly from the lateral edges of the frame 12. The      arms 20, aperture 18, and leads 16 are formed by progressive stamping from      a continuous strip of slightly resilient conductive metal (e.g. beryllium      copper or phosphor bronze). Thus, in the preferred embodiment, the      original blank strip will be at least as wide as the widest portion of the      frame 12 and arms 20. The original strip width is shown by dotted lines in      FIG. 2. While the arms 20 might be separately formed and suitably attached      to the frame 12, such as by welding, this would be unduly costly and      time-consuming and is not preferred. </PAR><PAR>  The process of forming and attaching leads to substrates according to the      present invention is shown schematically in FIG. 8. The various lead frame      positions, from left to right in FIG. 8, show the progressive stages and      operations that produce the final product, i.e., a circuit substrate 22      with a number of leads joined to and extending therefrom. These stages are      merely illustrative of the operations on and status of a frame and its      corresponding substrate as they are moved along by an appropriate indexing      apparatus from workstation to workstation (not shown). </PAR><PAR>  In stage or station 8a, a blank lead frame 12 is seen. The frame 12 may be      supplied at that point individually from a hopper, but is preferably      supplied from a reel or coil containing many frames in sequence. By the      next stage 8b the retaining arms 20 have been partially folded over the      leads 16, as seen in FIGS. 4 and 5. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows a cross-sectional side view of a lead frame 12. As seen in      this figure, the arms 20, previously in position B (shown in broken lines)      have been partially folded to position C. That position is determined so      that the tips of the two opposed arms 20 are separated by a distance      greater than the corresponding dimension of the substrate, so that a      substrate 22 may pass by the arms 20 and be dropped into the position      shown by the broken lines 22' in FIG. 4. FIG. 8 at stage 8b shows this      schematically. A substrate 22 is added, with its conductive pads 24      registering with and abutting the distal ends 26 of the lead 16. The      substrates 22 may be added automatically to the frames 12 from a hopper,      as each frame 12 successively arrives at station 8b. Solder 36 has      preferably already been added to either the ends of the leads 16 or to the      conductive pads 24, in a suitable manner, not shown. </PAR><PAR>  Between position 8b and position 8c, the retaining arms 20 are folded down      onto the substrate 22, as seen in FIG. 5, to prevent movement of the      substrate 22 relative to the frame 12. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the arms      20 have been moved from broken-line position C to position D, where they      hold the substrate against the leads 16. </PAR><PAR>  It will be seen in FIG. 5 that at the hinge or bending point 30 between the      retaining arms 20 and the frame 12, there is preferably a small circular      bend 32. This is formed at an appropriate stage during the progressive      stamping process or at the beginning of the arm-bending operation to cause      the retaining arms 20 to bend at the hinge point 30, rather than at a      random point along their lengths. With the arms 20 are already at position      C when the substrate 22 is added, crimping or compressing the hinge point      30 will cause the arms 20 to engage and clamp the substrate 22. This      creates a resilient force of the arms 20 down on the substrate 22,      sufficient to maintain the substrate 22 in position. In this way, no      outside direct force is applied to the substrate 22, avoiding pressures      that might crack it. </PAR><PAR>  It can also be seen in FIG. 5 that the outermost edge 28 of the retaining      arm 20 when folded over extends into opening 18 sufficiently to overlap      and firmly engage the substrate 22. While the retaining arms 20 are shown      in the form of a loop or handle, they may be solid, or in the form of      multiple outward extending stubs or fingers, or fashioned in any shape,      provided only that when they are folded inward, as described, an outer      portion 28 will engage the substrate 22 and hold it resiliently in place.      It will be understood that the outer portion is desirably straight as      shown, but may be curved or corrugated, configured to engage a larger area      of the substrate to hold it firmly against the leads 16. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, the retaining arms 20 may be left in position B until after      the substrate 22 is in place, and subsequently folded over the substrate,      although this would add production time, since the folding operation can      be more efficiently accomplished before the substrate is added. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 5, the leads 16 preferably have a slight bend or jog 34      near the distal end 26 to help properly position the substrate 22 as it      comes to rest on the leads 16, although this is not essential. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 5, which shows the conjunction of lead 16, the substrate 22 and a      retaining arm 20 in greater detail, the lead 16, solder 36 and the      conductive pad 24 can be seen in juxtaposition. The solder 36 may be a      solder paste, applied to the upper surface of the distal ends 26 of the      leads 16, or to the conductive pads 24 of substrate 22. Alternatively, to      expedite the soldering process, solder masses may be pre-attached to the      lead ends,26, in any suitable manner, as is common in making      solder-bearing leads. Leads of this type are shown, for example in U.S.      Pat. Nos. 4,120,558; 4,592,617 and 4,605,278; all to the present inventor.      This is preferred as the solder can be applied during the frame production      process, avoiding extra steps during the substrate attachment process. </PAR><PAR>  Returning to FIG. 8, at stage 8c, the substrate 22 is in position, held by      retaining arms 28 as described in relation to FIG. 4 and 5. By having the      downward resilient force of the retaining arms 20 applied near the outer      periphery of the substrate 22, the force will tend to keep the pad 24 in      contact with the lead 16. Fashioning the retaining arms 20 to extend along      the major part of the length of the substrate 22 causes a distribution of      force and avoids any local force which may harmfully affect the substrate      22. The substrate 22 will generally be rigid enough so that the two edges      not engaged by the retaining arms 20 will not bend. </PAR><PAR>  In this way, the substrate and lead frame are held as an assembly, with      each lead in its proper position relative to a conductive pad, as shown in      FIG. 5, ready for soldering. </PAR><PAR>  The substrate/frame assembly may then be readily transported directly to a      stage 8d, where heat is then applied to the substrate/frame assembly by      any conventional means, such as a heat chamber surrounding stage 8d, or by      hot gases impinging on the leads 16 at their ends 26. Usually about three      to four seconds is sufficient for this. In the prior art, it was necessary      thereafter to maintain the frame/substrate assembly at the heating stage      in its heating clamp (with the heat turned off) for another 15 to 20      seconds while the solder cools sufficiently to solidify so that leads 16      are joined to the substrate strongly enough to be self-sufficient. With      the retaining arms 20 of the present invention, the assembly can be moved      out of the heating chamber or stage 8d as soon as the solder has melted,      without risk of the substrate 22 shifting relative to the frame. Once out      of the chamber, the assembly will begin to cool. In the next 15 seconds or      so, three to five more assemblies can be moved into the heating stage,      heated and moved out. Thus, the throughput of a soldering station using      the invention is a multiple of that of the prior art. This scenario      assumes that the assemblies are heated one at a time in a single heating      stage. If more than one is heated at a time, by multiple heating stages,      the output is simply multiplied. Utilizing the present invention, it is      also possible to maintain a constant temperature at the heating stage 8d,      rather than constantly cycling a heating clamp by heating and allowing to      cool. Positions 8e-8g show assemblies that have already been heated and      are now cooling, while the substrate 22 of stage 8d is being heated. </PAR><PAR>  An additional advantage of the retaining arms 20 of the invention lies in      their simplicity of release and disposal from the substrate 22. At a      subsequent position 8h (FIG. 8), after the solder has solidified, the      frame 12 is cut at the four dotted lines E to leave the leads 16      projecting from substrate 22. It can be seen that the arms 20 will also be      cut off by this operation. The retaining arms 20 are then discarded with      the frame 12. At position 8i, the final product is seen--a circuit      substrate 22, with leads 16 extending therefrom, ready for connection to      other electronic devices. Of course, discarded metal can be recycled to      make a new strip 10, so essentially no extra material is needed for the      retaining arms 20. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 7, an alternate embodiment of the invention is shown, in which the      outer edges 28 of the retaining arms 20 are angled toward the lead frame      12. In operation, the retaining arms 20 are fashioned into the position      shown in FIG. 7 before insertion of the substrate 22. Upon insertion of      the substrate 22, the edges 28 contact the substrate 22 on its side      surfaces. The arms 20 flex slightly, allowing the substrate 22 to pass,      but frictionally engaging its sides. This frictional force, combined with      the resiliency of the retaining arms 20, keeps the substrate 22 firmly in      place on the leads 16. Heat is applied to the substrate/frame assembly at      position 8d, melting the solder 36. Here again, because of the retaining      arms 20, the substrate 22 is held in fixed position with respect to the      frame 12, permitting removal from the heating zone before      re-solidification of the solder. </PAR><PAR>  While the embodiments of the invention shown and described are all capable      of achieving the results desired, it is to be understood that these      embodiments have been shown and described for purposes of illustration      only and not for purposes of limitation. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
