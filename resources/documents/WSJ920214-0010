But the plan isn't being embraced as widely as the companyhad hoped. Creditors of the company's steel unit are expectedto tell U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland today thatthe plan isn't ready to be presented for a formal vote bycreditors. And the steel creditors are most closely alignedwith the company's position; the other major creditor groups,representing holders of parent-company and aerospace-unitdebt, are expected to like the revised plan even less.</LP><TEXT>   The steel creditors are also expected to throw a volatilenew issue into LTV's long-running bankruptcy proceedings bysuggesting that it is &quot;clearly necessary&quot; for the steel unitto reject its collective bargaining agreement with the UnitedSteelworkers of America. Rejection of union contracts ispermissible under certain circumstances in bankruptcy-courtreorganizations.   A union spokesman said such a move would be &quot;of doubtfullegality,&quot; in part because rejection is prohibited under thecurrent union contract, which expires Aug. 1, 1993. Thespokesman called the steel creditors' statement&quot;sabre-rattling&quot; but predicted a strike if the contract isrejected. The steelworkers struck under similar circumstancesduring the bankruptcy-court reorganization ofWheeling-Pittsburgh Corp., another steelmaker.   Renegotiating the steelworkers' contract already is astipulation for LTV's emergence from bankruptcy-courtprotection, as is closing the sales of the company'saerospace and defense units.   Even with those issues pending, LTV projects that it couldemerge from bankruptcy-court protection late this year orearly next. The company has operated under the court'sprotection from creditors for five years and seven months.Its first reorganization plan, which was panned by creditors,was filed in May.   Some of the broader provisions of the new reorganizationplan have won backing from the steel unit's creditors and thefederal pension insurance agency, which has the power toenforce LTV's liability for a $3.1 billion shortfall in thesteel unit's pension funds. Negotiations on the plan werecontinuing this week with creditors of the parent company andthe aerospace unit.   Under the new plan, the pension funds would receive thebulk of LTV's cash, including a $1.5 billion upfront payment.The remainder of the pension liabilities would be spread over30 years.   None of the creditors are expected to receive cash tosettle their claims, with the possible exception of theaerospace creditors. Instead, the creditors would receivestock in a reorganized LTV, albeit a leaner company than whatwas projected in the reorganization plan submitted May 1.   The original plan didn't contemplate the sale of LTV'saerospace unit, which includes divisions that make planes andmissiles. The sale of the aerospace and defense units, whichacocunted for 39% of LTV's $1.51 billion in sales in 1991,will leave LTV as a steelmaker with a small oil-and-gas unit.   How such a trimmed-down company would fare in themarketplace is a matter of dispute. Competing steelmakersgrumble that LTV has gained an edge because its bankruptcyfiling has allwed it to delay interest payments and cast offsome of its pension obligations, while other steelmakersstruggle to fund theirs.   During the bankruptcy proceedings, LTV creditors approved$2 billion in modernization and capital improvements, whichwill allow LTV to emerge with some of the newest and besttechnology in the industry. LTV also formed twoelectro-galvanizing ventures with Sumitomo, the Japanesesteelmaker. And last month, LTV announced a $312 millionproject to install a continuous caster at its Cleveland Worksby the end of next year, making LTV the only integratedsteelmaker with 100% continuous casting.   Nevertheless, says Michael Shanahan, an Arthur D. Littleconsultant, &quot;LTV is going to have to face a lot more of thetotal pension liability than they wanted or they would haveexpected. They're going to be lean, mean, fit and nasty, butthey have to be incredibily competitive to absorb thatpension liability.&quot;   While LTV is currently the largest supplier of sheet steelto the automotive and appliance markets, it faces increasingthreats from imports and American minimills in asteel-rolling market already hampered by overcapacity. Lastweek, Nucor Corp., a minimill trying to break into theflat-rolled busines, took another swipe at the integratedsteelmakers when it droped its prices by about 5%.</TEXT></DOC>
