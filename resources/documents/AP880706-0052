(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker and PTL officials disputed thereception the former television evangelist received when heappeared at the ministry's Heritage USA theme park over the holidayweekend.   Bakker said Tuesday that PTL Chief of Security Gene Ervin askedhim and his wife, Tammy, to stay away from Fourth of Julyceremonies at Heritage USA Monday night after earlier weekendappearances caused a commotion.   Bakker said Ervin told him that PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton``was worried because of the amount of people that would gatheraround us, that it would be dangerous.''   But Ervin said, ``I only advised them that if they came on theproperty, we didn't want any type of disturbance. That was it.There was no talk about prohibiting them from the property.''   Bakker, who is seeking to buy back Heritage USA, said he and hiswife drew 2,400 supporters in afternoon visits Sunday and Monday.On Sunday night, he said he and Tammy went out for ice cream andwere surrounded by supporters at a shopping mall connected to theHeritage Grand Hotel.   ``It was so overwhelming,'' Bakker said. ``They started saying,`We want you back.' They followed us to our car. We decided to gohome.''   But Ervin said th crowd of between 150 and 200 people includedmany who do not support their return.   ``There was some hecklers and jeers coming from the crowd. Someelderly people were shoved, bumped, (and) pushed around,'' he said.``It caused what I considered a safety hazard.''   Ervin also said Bakker told him his supporters could riot uponhis command, a claim the evangelist denied.</TEXT></DOC>
