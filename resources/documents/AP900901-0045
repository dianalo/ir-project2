(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A year after a Labor Day marred byriots and looting, this resort city is trying to make people forgetby putting on its finest.   Many are staying away because they remember only the worst.   ``The table is set. We've got our best linen, best china, bestsilver, best crystal,'' Andrew Fine, co-chairman of the CommunityCoordination Committee, said Friday.   Lingering fears that the rioting of last year might be repeatedare making some of the preparations unnecessary as the city'shotels _ full to capacity during the 1989 Labor Day holiday _ areless than half full today.   City Manager Aubrey Watts said that hotels were at 48 percentoccupancy Friday night, but: ``It appears to be rising.''   The end-of-summer party, which for the past 10 years hasattracted students from predominantly black East Coast colleges,last year erupted in looting and violent confrontations betweenyouths and police. Damage was estimated at more than $1.4 million.   Many of the young people and civil rights leaders said theclashes were racially motivated and the city did not want blackvisitors. City officials said the problem was one of too manypeople in too small an area with too little to do.   More than 100,000 young people jammed the city's beachfrontstrip for the 1989 Labor Day weekend.   Early today, young people walked and rode bicycles along theoceanfront thoroughfare. City police officers and state trooperswere out in force, walking in pairs and riding horses. Clergymenaccompanied many of the patrols, ready to act as peacemakers.   Police Chief Charles R. Wall declined to say how many officerswere on patrol, but said the entire 607-member force is working12-hour shifts over the weekend.   Police said three men in a car fired into an unoccupied careight blocks from the oceanfront early today. No one was injured,and there were no arrests.   Police said they made only a handful of arrests for publicdrunkenness.   ``I've never seen it this quiet on a Friday night or any othernight for that matter,'' said Dot Keller, who works at Clarke's Pub.   Last year, police backed by state troopers and the NationalGuard twice cleared the oceanfront after looting broke out.   Hundreds of people were arrested or cited, and more than 50 wereinjured. Most of those arrested were local residents, not collegestudents.   This year the city appointed a biracial committee, includingstudents, to plan the event _ dubbed Laborfest. Local merchantsraised more than $100,000 to provide entertainment along theoceanfront.   Despite local efforts, some black students at schools thatpreviously frequented Virginia Beach called for a boycott.   Mayor Meyera Oberndorf said she was confident the Labor Dayweekend would be a successful contrast to last year's violence.   ``We will be able to show a watching world that many things arepossible when people trust and show respect,'' she said Fridaynight.   But some merchants boarded up storefronts for the weekend.   Norfolk State University helped book two nights of entertainmentat a city park about four miles from the oceanfront, hoping tospread out crowds that used to congregate solely at the beach.   The city also closed a section of the oceanfront to cars and setup satellite parking lots away from the beach serviced by shuttlebuses.</TEXT></DOC>
