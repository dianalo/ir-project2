Oliver Barre was hit by a city bus as he walked across thestreet with a companion Tuesday morning on his way to a VeteransAdministration hospital about a block away, police said. He diedtwo hours later at Bellevue Hospital, hospital spokeswoman BrendaRivera said.   Helen Carroll, 90, described by Rivera as Barre's girlfriend,suffered head injuries and was listed in serious condition thismorning at Bellevue, said hospital administrator Robert Frazier.   The bus driver, Basil Pesce, was cited for failing to yield topedestrians, police said. He was not injured in the accident, andthe bus carried no passengers.   Barre was charged with second-degree murder in the metal pipebludgeoning of an elderly neighbor June 16.   He pleaded innocent and was due in court Oct. 4. Barre claimedhis victim, Norma Marks, 88, had tried to strangle him and poisonother people in his building.   More than 140 residents of Barre's apartment building petitionedto have him jailed after the murder.   However, Rubin allowed him out on bail provided he only leavehis apartment from 2 to 4 p.m.   On Monday, his lawyer got special permission for Barre to go tothe VA hospital Tuesday morning.</TEXT></DOC>
