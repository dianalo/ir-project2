The commission's 3-0 vote on Thursday to allow ATandamp;T to set pricesbased on an inflation-linked index will reverse the steep decline inlong-distance rates that has taken place since the breakup of theold Bell system in 1984, the critics said.   The FCC claims the new method will save ratepayers some $900million over four years.   ``I fear that the days of real long-distance price reductions forthe average residential caller may be over,'' said Rep. Edward J.Markey, D-Mass., who added that he would co-sponsor legislationrequiring close monitoring of the new plan to ``cap'' ATandamp;T's rates.   Markey, who is chairman of the House Energy and Commercesubcommittee on telecommunications and finance, said the FCC's plan``does not contain sufficient consumer safeguards to ensure thatresidential telephone customers will fairly share in rate reductionswhich should result from new telephone technologies.''   Since the mid-1960s ATandamp;T has been allowed to earn a setpercentage profit above its costs _ currently 12.2 percent. Underthis so-called rate-of-return regulation ATandamp;T's long-distance rateshave dropped 38 percent since 1984.   Much of that decrease has resulted from higher prices consumershave been paying to connect to local telephone networks. Withconsumers paying more, long-distance companies have paid less to thelocal telephone networks, and the FCC has forced ATandamp;T to pass thosesavings along to its long-distance customers.   The new price caps plan, which goes into effect July 1, willallow ATandamp;T to raise rates to three percentage points less than therate of inflation in each of its three categories of service:residential and small business; 800 calls; and other businessservices, mainly for large customers.   If the inflation rate were 4 percent, ATandamp;T could raise rates ineach of the three categories or ``baskets'' by 1 percent _ which theFCC calls the price cap index.   Within that residential-small business basket, prices may go upor down for the six individual services in that basket _ daytimecalling; evening; weekend and night; international; Reach OutAmerica; and operator assistance and credit card calling _ as longas the average increase for the basket of services does not exceed 1percent.   What worries critics is that an item inside the basket, such asevening or weekend and night calling, may rise at the rate ofinflation plus the price cap index. So with an inflation rate of 4percent, the prices for popular evening, night and weekend callingwould rise 5 percent, with other reductions bringing down the basketaverage.   ``It will possibly give you the first real long-distanceincreases since the breakup of ATandamp;T,'' said Gene Kimmelman,executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. Like othercritics, he says ATandamp;T has been trying to cut the discounts it givesto evening, night and weekend callers and then lower rates in themore competitive, business-dominated daytime segment.   Prices in all categories within the basket also may not fall morethan 5 percent, which is designed to keep ATandamp;T from trying to driveout competition with big price reductions.   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said the change to price caps wouldgive ATandamp;T a profit incentive to cut costs and improve itsefficiency. Critics fear that service will suffer as a result.   Others, such as Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., fear the FCC willabandon the geographical rate-averaging philosophy that keeps pricesmore or less constant in all areas of the country. Patrick hasmaintained the agency will not change that philosophy.   Cooper earlier this month introduced a bill that would delayprice caps. He said Thursday he would meet with Markey to determinewhether to continue with that legislation.   ATandamp;T applauded the decision but said it was ``mystified that thecommission finds it necessary to continue treating ATandamp;T differentlyby limiting our ability to reduce prices in such an extremelycompetitive market.''</TEXT></DOC>
