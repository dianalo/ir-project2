(Software Development '89 Conference)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Coffee, Peter.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Developers meeting at the Software Development '89 conferencedebated the future of MSDOS, Unix, OS-2 and the Apple Macintoshoperating environment in the decade to come.andP;  Developers areanxiously awaiting a market move that could send them on apositive course to building products for a user-embraced operatingsystem.andP;  There was strong faith in the future of MS-DOS, whichalready dominates the market.andP;  More than 25 million users use theeight-year-old operating systems on microcomputers, compared to 3million Macintosh users and a million Unix users on 300,000systems.andP;  Developers questioned the efficiency of using a lot ofprocessing capacity on graphical user interfaces like OS-2'sPresentation Manager.andP;  OS-2 promoters argued DOS has reached itslimits and OS-2 will expand on the DOS environment.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     System DevelopmentOperating SystemsProgrammersOS-2UNIXMSDOSConferencesSoftware EngineeringMicrocomputers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Peter CoffeeandM;In the computer business, applications developers are the only true victimsof innovation.andP;  Every major advance in operating systems puts developers intoa ''bet the company'' position.andM;On the one hand, developers can focus their efforts on the future marketleader, assuming they know what that will be; on the other hand, they can tryto cover all the bases, with a diluted effort perhaps producing second-rateproducts that are portable, but unpopular.andM;These concerns were addressed in a panel discussion, ''The Operating Systemfor the '90s,'' at last month's Software Development '89 conference inBurlingame, Calif.andP;  The panel included proponents of MS-DOS, OS/2, Unix andthe Macintosh, with Jim Gimpel, president of Gimpel Software in Collegeville,Pa., as moderator.andM;Today's developers, according to Gimpel, would like to push the state of theart with the capabilities of new platforms, but they cannot afford to leavetheir current customer base too far behind.andM;''When we picture an end user,'' he said, ''many of us picture the people whobought Z80 systems running CP/M in the early '80s.''andM;Those who developed for that market may be finding it difficult to ceasesupporting ''systems they would rather walk away from,'' he said.andM;''We're faced today with 25 million DOS systems out there,'' Gimpelcontinued.andP;  ''There's nothing else really like it, with only 3 millionMacintoshes and 1 million Unix users on 300,000 systems.''andM;For Chip Rabinowitz, principal of Innovative Data Concepts in Glenside, Pa.,andO;the operating system of choice was quite clear.andP;  ''We've got 25 millionpeople already using [DOS,] the operating system of the '90s,'' he said.andM;In a pointed attack on the OS/2 Presentation Manager, Rabinowitz added, ''Idon't like it when [Microsoft Corp.andP;  President] Bill Gates tells me to stopwriting text-mode programs .andP;  .  .  I don't see spending 30 percent of myprocessor's capacity to draw pictures of trash cans on the screen.''andM;Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., isalso betting on MS-DOS.andP;  Phar Lap has recently introduced VMM 386, a virtualmemory manager that allows 80386 applications to use the hard disk asauxiliary memory.andM;''The companies providing operating systems,'' Smith noted, ''are basicallyafter the hearts and minds of software developers.andP;  Developers, in turn, areattracted by installed base.andP;  That means MS-DOS, but DOS has the problem ofnot enough memory.''andM;Gary Saxer, director of technical services for Quarterdeck Office Systems inSanta Monica, Calif., proposes Quarterdeck's Desqview as a platform foradding more sophisticated cooperative capabilities to DOS (as opposed to PharLap's emphasis on more memory for individual applications).andM;However, maintained Greg Whitten, a systems architect with Microsoft inRedmond, Wash., DOS can only be stretched so far.andP;  Installed base is onething, he said, but developers' ability to provide radically new capabilitiesis the other side of the balance -- the side that OS/2 is emphasizing.andM;''OS/2 today is the most capable operating system on the market,'' Whittensaid, adding that it has tremendous potential for development.andP;  ''We'relooking at extensive object-oriented changes at the system level, withobject-oriented extensions to our languages as well.andP;  We're also working onmultiprocessor environments.''andM;Charlie Bedard, manager of Macintosh operating-system software for AppleComputer Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., took a position similar to Whitten's.andO;''The operating system of the '90s is not an argument about pipes and so on,but an argument about development environments and programming models,'' hesaid.andP;  ''Our job is to offer developers models that meet their needs and arealso fairly long-lived.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
