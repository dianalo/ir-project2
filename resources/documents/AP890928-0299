The makers of ``Fibre Trim'' tablets have no reasonable basisfor advertising claims that it is ``a proven, natural way to loseweight,'' said the complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission.   The commission also challenged claims that the product offers``all of fiber's wonderful health benefits'' and provides 2.35grams of fiber in one serving.   The panel voted 4-0 to issue the complaint, with chairwomanJanet Steiger not voting. The FTC has set a Nov. 28 hearing date.   Schering Corp., a subsidiary of Schering-Plough Corp., a majornational pharmaceutical manufacturer, is the U.S. distributor ofFibre Trim.   Fibre Trim, sold as a diet pill and fruit tablets to bedissolved in water, is manufactured in Denmark.   ``We believe the advertising for Fibre Trim was completelytruthful and properly substantiated,'' said Steve Galpin, aSchering spokesman.   Six strictly controlled studies in which some patients weregiven placebos ``demonstrate the effectiveness of Fibre Trim,''Galpin said.   He also said there was ``an extensive body of scientificliterature showing that fiber can be used to help people loseweight.''   Schering ranked fifth among pharmaceutical companies with $2.1billion in 1987 sales. Fibre Trim sales captured 12.9 percent ofthe diet aids and meal replacements market in 1988, according toSchering.   The company also produces Maybelline cosmetics, Coppertone suncare products and Dr. Scholl's foot care products.   Galpin said the company will continue to promote, advertise andsell Fibre Trim.</TEXT></DOC>
