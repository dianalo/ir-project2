The legislation, introduced yesterday, is in response to Wall Street's unfolding insider-trading scandal and what Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) calls &quot;merger mania.&quot;    The objective is to ensure a &quot;fairer shake&quot; for shareholders and to restrict market manipulations for short-term gains, said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the Banking Committee's securities panel. &quot;This legislation in no way seeks to discourage takeovers by people who want to actually acquire and run a company,&quot; he said.    The two chairmen, as chief sponsors of the measure, embraced several recommendations from Rudolph Giuliani, the federal prosecutor in Manhattan who has been bringing the Wall Street cases. &quot;We agree with U.S. Attorney Giuliani that the best way to deter insider trading is to impose a prison sentence,&quot; Mr. Riegle said.    The enforcement provisions would double the maximum sentence for insider trading to 10 years and would increase the maximum criminal fine to $1 million from $100,000. A minimum one-year sentence also would be required for perjury or obstruction of justice in connection with an insider-trading investigation.    The package also would:   --Require stock purchasers who acquire 3% or more of a company's shares to report their holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission within one day. Currently, a stake of 5% or more must be reported within 10 days.    --Require purchasers to identify the source of their financing and disclose any fees paid to lenders and others. They would also have to specify whether they were making an investment or a takeover bid; investors would be forbidden to make a tender offer for six months from the filing date.    --Extend the current tender-offer period of 20 business days to 35 business days.    --Require bidders to make a formal tender offer after they acquire a stake of 15% or more.    --Prohibit &quot;greenmail&quot; payments, or stock buybacks at a premium above the market price to buy off hostile bidders.    --Outlaw &quot;poison-pill&quot; provisions designed to make a company prohibitively expensive to acquire, unless such provisions are approved by shareholders.    --Require risk arbitragers who aren't currently subject to SEC regulation to register with the commission.    --Prohibit companies from tapping surplus corporate pension funds to pay takeover debts until five years after the takeover.    Some provisions under consideration were left out, pending three hearings on takeovers this month, according to Banking Committee staff members. One provision would have required corporate raiders to line up 100% of their financing before they make a bid. Another would have increased the liability of securities firms and senior management for misconduct.    If these provisions attract enough support, they may be added to the package, the staff members said. Sen. Proxmire plans to move the measure out of committee in July. </TEXT></DOC>
