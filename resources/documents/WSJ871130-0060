As an editor, whether whacking away at excess verbiage (much, I fancy, as my president famously clears brush) or deftly (flattering myself) substituting a juster mot, I'm convinced I'm improving copy. As an editee, upon whom the above -- and more, and worse -- has been wrought, I'm convinced my copy (my life's blood!) is being ruined, although I've never resorted, as one of the writers I edited was wont to do, to what I call the Ultimate Appeal. When all his pleas to restore what I had changed or deleted fell on deaf ears, he would cry out, &quot;You've destroyed my rhythm!&quot;    I call it the Ultimate Appeal because it's irrefutable. This dude wasn't Alfred Tennyson or even Alfred Noyes: If there was a single metrical foot in his pedestrian account of a basketball team, only he was privy to its impress.    Now I must edit myself. Actually it has been many years since I considered my prose inviolable, and even as an editee I now consider editing a good and necessary thing. In fact, I seek it; it helps me realize my intentions. Largely this was brought home to me at The New Yorker, which published more than 30 of my stories; there the editing was invariably scrupulous, solicitous, gentle -- and always improved what I had written (well, almost always). Further, since the suggested changes were written in the margins of the galleys in a small, neat, inoffensive hand, followed by plaintive little question marks, my work was pleasingly adorned as well.    When I was managing editor of Sports Illustrated and Discover, it was a whole different ball game, particularly at SI, a weekly, where the copy came in thick, fast and usually too long. Amid this tumult, excellence often had to vie with expedience, as well as legal restraints -- and stories had to fit, which was often synonymous with being drastically cut. Still, although we writ large and deled slashingly, we did our very best not to ruin anyone's copy (or destroy his unheard rhythms). Our intention was to put out the best magazine we could -- on time. Of course, every week there were sullen writers, but there were sullen editors, too, who had to deal with third-rate and/or overlong stories.    All this is by way of a walk-up to my theme: three bills now before Congress, once again proposing that the U.S. join the Berne Copyright Convention. Although 76 countries belong to Berne and although most of its concepts are pure motherhood, one article threatens the way we in America traditionally conduct what are called &quot;intellectual property businesses&quot;: Berne requires its member countries to have laws to protect what Europeans refer to as the &quot;moral rights&quot; of an author (or a photographer, an illustrator, etc.).    Despite their name, these rights don't have to do with morality (a convicted murderer who chronicled his crime would have just as much &quot;moral rights&quot; protection as I would for a short story), but instead empower an author (or photographer, illustrator, etc.) to move against a &quot;mutilation&quot; or &quot;alteration&quot; of his creation that would be &quot;prejudicial&quot; to his honor. And these rights may very well be inalienable -- i.e., they couldn't be contracted away or otherwise transferred.    Well, at first blush this sounds reasonable, even admirable, but upon reflection, one man's enhancement is another's mutilation.    A case in point: Shostakovich v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. That case, initially brought in a New York state court in the 1940s, involved &quot;The Iron Curtain,&quot; a movie depicting Soviet espionage in Canada. No doubt for reasons of &quot;enhancement,&quot; the movie maker used Russian compositions that weren't copyrighted as background music. The works' composers, Dmitri Shostakovich and three other Soviets, sued for damages and a permanent injunction against exhibition of the film, alleging that it violated their moral rights because it was &quot;unsympathetic to their political ideology.&quot; The New York court refused to grant the relief they sought. The composers brought the same action in a French court, which found a violation of their moral rights and ordered the film seized in that country.    To my immediate point: How can you put out a magazine when you have to worry about the despair of a writer whose overwrought lead has been lopped off, a photographer mortified by the way his picture has been cropped, an illustrator disconsolate because his drawing has been reproduced humiliatingly small so that the purported delicacy of his line is indiscernible? And who's to decide who's right?    I'm concerned about Berne because it would deliver the editing process into the hands of America's legal system, which, unlike its counterparts abroad, has an uncanny ability to unearth controversy when none exists and to allege million-dollar injuries for trifles. I've been involved in enough legal controversies to know I prefer the editing process to the legal process. I'm for keeping both the lawyers and Berne out.    P.S. What you've just read has been edited.    ---   Mr. Rogin, corporate editor of Time Inc., has published two novels and a collection of short stories. </TEXT></DOC>
