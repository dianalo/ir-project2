W. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, toldan advisory group of bankers and others affected by the industrythat the three-member board is still considering actions to take buthas ``focused on a direction.''   He said the moves would be ``very positive for the industry'' butmay not be what anyone expects.   ``I have nothing more to say other than `stay tuned,''' saidWall, who had made a similar statement to a National Council ofSavings Institutions in New York a day earlier. ``Hold onto yourhats,'' he told the Sandamp;L executives. ``We are going to be takingsteps that are going to surprise everyone.''   The council and the larger U.S. League of Savings Institutionshave sharply different views on how to approach the industry crisis.Estimates of the amount of money it will take to bail out orliquidate failing Sandamp;Ls range from $50 billion to $100 billion.   The council, two thirds of whose members are savings banks whosedeposits are presently insured by the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., proposed on Tuesday that the FDIC insure all savingsinstitutions, not just banks.   The proposal would dismantle the nearly bankrupt Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp. after about five years, during which theinsurer would liquidate the remaining insolvent Sandamp;Ls. FSLIC insuresdeposits in Sandamp;Ls but no longer has enough money in its accounts tocover deposits in all those expected to fail.   The larger league, which includes some Sandamp;Ls that are not healthyenough to join the FDIC, wants to retain the separate systems forsavings institutions and banks.   Wall made no comment on those differing proposals, but said theboard is examining several ideas for dealing with the industry'sproblems.   He said up to 60 financially troubled savings institutions willhave been dealt with by the end of 1988, with about 200 more to bedealt with next year.   A large proportion of the Sandamp;L's the board has had to deal withare in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and New Mexico, wherelow oil and natural gas prices have hurt the economies.   Board member Roger Martin noted that the bulk of savingsinstitutions remain strong and suggested that the industry conduct acampaign to counteract the bad publicity that inevitably will resultfrom continued Sandamp;L liquidations.</TEXT></DOC>
