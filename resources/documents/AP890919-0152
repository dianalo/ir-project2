U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson said Secord was raisinga significant legal issue, but rejected as too time-consuming anattempt to delay the trial so that an appeals court panel couldissue an advisory opinion.   ``We're looking at about a year'' if such a course were pursued,said the judge.   At a hearing Tuesday, Secord's attorney, Thomas Green, said allnine criminal counts pertaining to Secord's congressional tstimonyshould be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Robinson said near theend of the court hearing that, ``this case is going to go to trial,I think.''   Secord, the retired Air Force major general enlisted by OliverNorth to run arms to the Contras and assist in the Reaganadministration's secret Iran initiative, is accused of obstructingCongress, perjury and making false statements. His trial isscheduled to begin Nov. 13.   The government says Secord lied when he denied taking money outof the companies he and Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim usedin the Iran-Contra initiative. Prosecutors allege Secord took over amillion dollars in profits.   Green argued that independent counsel Lawrence Walsh was requiredunder the Ethics in Government Act to get an expanded mandate fromthe attorney general before launching the probe of Secord's 1987testimony to the Iran-Contra committees of Congress.   Walsh was appointed in December 1986 and ``I think theindependent counsel made an irreparable mistake in not going back tothe attorney general'' seeking to expand the investigative mandatebefore delving into Secord's congressional testimony, Green said.   Associate independent counsel Reid Weingarten said the intent ofthe appeals court panel appointing the Iran-Contra prosecutor was toallow wide latitude in the investigation.   ``It's hard to imagine a broader grant of jurisdiction,''Weingarten said of the appeals court panel's mandate.   The court on Dec. 19, 1986, appointed Walsh to look into allegedcrimes in the Iran-Contra affair committed ``in or about 1984 downto the present.'' It also authorized the independent counsel toprosecute any other alleged crime committed by North or others whenthe allegations are ``connected with or arising out of'' Walsh'sinvestigation.   Secord also is accused of three counts of conspiring, offeringand paying illegal gratuities to North.   In a recent interview on the Fox Television program ``TheReporters,'' Secord said he has suffered financially due to theIran-Contra scandal.   ``We're about as close to being broke as you can come,'' Secordof his family. He said he had to pull two of his children out ofcollege because ``we just couldn't continue to support that.''   Asked in the TV interview about his allegedly having pulled inmore than a million dollars in profits from the Iran-Contra scandal,Secord responded:   ``If I had done that I wouldn't be in the financial bind now ...It's just pure myth.''   On Monday, Secord was convicted of driving while intoxicated insuburban Virginia, his second drunken driving conviction since May.He is appealing both convictions.</TEXT></DOC>
