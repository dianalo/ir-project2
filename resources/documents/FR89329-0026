(This is not a toll-free number.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The General Services Administrationpublished and adopted the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards on August7, 1984 (49 FR 31528, 49 FR 31620 and 49 FR 31625). The standards wereamended on November 29, 1985 (50 FR 49039 and 50 FR 49045).The signage section, andSection; 4.30 in the Uniform Federal AccessibilityStandards (UFAS) adopted as Appendix A in 24 CFR Part 40 and in 41 CFR101-19.6, states that all signs required to be accessible by andSection;4.1 Minimum Requirements shall comply with andSection; 4.30. Section 4.30.4requires that signs be tactile by either raised or indented characters.It was never the intent of UFAS that all signs be tactile. Neither theANSI A117.1-1980, on which UFAS was based, nor the new ANSI A117.1-1986,requires that all signs be tactile. It was intended that the UFAS wouldrequire all signs to comply with the requirements in andSection; 4.30.2,Character proportion, andSection; 4.30.3, Color contrast, and should alsocomply with andSection; 4.30.5, Symbols of accessibility, when accessiblefeatures are provided.Section 4.1.1(7) should have included specific scoping provisions for andSection;4.30, Signage, rather than requiring that all signs comply with andSection;4.30. This is supported by the way in which andSection; 4.1.2(15) is written,which indicates that the provisions of andSection;andSection; 4.30.4 and 4.30.6apply only to certain signs; thus, signs not specifically cited in andSection;4.1.1(7) or andSection; 4.1.2(15) were not required to be tactile.Section 4.1.2(15) should have specified scoping provisions for andSection;4.30, Signage, rather than requiring that all signs comply with andSection;4.30.In addition, a conforming change is needed in andSection; 4.30.4 to deletethe words ``indented'' and ``incised'' where they appear so that andSection;4.30.4 conforms with the language in andSection;andSection; 4.10.5 and 4.10.12,which language does not provide for indented or incised letters for elevatorhoistway entrance floor designations and car control panels. (The inclusionof the word ``indented'' in andSection; 4.30.4 was a drafting error in theoriginal UFAS.)The General Services Administration has determined that this rule is nota major rule for the purpose of Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981,because it is not likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more; a major increase in costs to consumers or others;or significant adverse effects. The General Services Administration hasbased all administrative decisions underlying this rule on adequate informationconcerning the need for, and consequences of, this rule; has determinedthat the potential benefits to society from this rule outweigh the potentialcosts; has maximized the net benefits; and has chosen the alternative approachinvolving the least net cost to society.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 41 CFR Part 101-19</ITAG>Federal buildings and facilities, Government property management, Handicapped.Accordingly, Title 41 CFR Part 101-19 is amended as set forth below:1.
