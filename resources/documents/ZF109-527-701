(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>V I T A L S I G N SandM;By Peter CoffeeandM;Most PC graphics software isn't truly &quot;soft,&quot; but is closely tied to graphicshardware.andP;  Ever since the days of IBM's Color Graphics Adapter, production ofPC graphics screens has forced the developer to count pixels for sizes andpositions, to memorize arbitrary values for colors and patterns, and to fallback on assembly language for tasks that DOS did not (and still does not)conveniently support.andM;Software development with these techniques took too long to complete.andP;  Evenworse, this approach yielded &quot;hard&quot; code that ran only on almost identicalmachines.andP;  This code was made obsolete by every change in marketplacestandards for graphic displays, and was a major factor in killing offgraphically superior but fatally different machines such as Texas InstrumentsInc.'s Professional and Digital Equipment Corp.'s (DEC's) Rainbow.andM;This graphics approach could never meet the needs of Project Athena, aneffort in 1984 to expand the use of networked workstations at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Mass.andP;  With donatedhardware from IBM, DEC and others, there was an absolute requirement forgraphics that could be ported across a wide range of CPU architectures andoperating systems.andM;And with the varied styles and minimal budgets of academic softwaredevelopment, even rehosting of core (non-graphic) code was out of thequestion.andP;  Programs had to run on the systems on which they were developed,while serving an interactive user on a different kind of machine at theopposite end of the campus.andM;MIT's goal of generalized campus computing spurred a need for anext-generation user interface: one that hid the abbreviated commands of araw operating system, making computers approachable by students and facultyfrom disciplines far removed from computer science.andM;These demands resulted in the X Window System, also called X Windows, whichwas released for use by developers in 1986 with version 10.4.andP;  The X Windowsprotocols have quickly become an overwhelming standard in the workstationcommunity and are poised to seize a similar role in the heterogeneousnetworks of corporate client/server computing.andM;X Windows is not solely a Unix enhancement, although it meets many needs thatare also addressed by Unix, such as support for multiple vendors, and isoften found on Unix machines.andP;  It is not a graphical user interface (GUI),though it is the foundation for building several portable GUI designs.andM;X Windows must be understood as an architecture before it can be appreciatedas an element of any product.andM;In this review, PC Week Labs explores the nature and benefits of X Windowscomputing, and examines current and anticipated products that deliver itsbenefits through improved software development and more convenient end-useroperations.andM;To understand the opportunities created by X Windows, it is best to compareclassical PC graphics against X Windows' layered architecture (see diagram,above).andP;  Most PC software manipulates a &quot;frame buffer,&quot; a region of memorythat can receive data through one set of connections (from an applicationprogram) while the display hardware reads that data through an alternate&quot;port,&quot; hence the expression &quot;dual-ported memory.&quot;andM;Each bit location in the display buffer corresponds to some feature, such asbrightness or color, of one and only one location on the screen -- leading tothe term &quot;bit-mapped graphics.&quot; Another term for this design is &quot;all pointsaddressable&quot; (APA) -- another way of saying that every point on the screencan be separately controlled.andM;Compared with the limits of the Apple II, where groups of pixels arecontrolled by color bits affecting the entire group, the APA design of theIBM PC set a new standard of luxury for affordable desktop machines.andO;Applications such as Lotus Development Corp.'s 1-2-3 and Microsoft Corp.'sFlight Simulator quickly became benchmarks of performance.andP;  And, because oftheir direct manipulation of the video subsystem, they also became benchmarksof strict hardware compatibility.andM;For the corporate or campus application that must transmit graphics across anetwork, the brute simplicity of the bit map turns into a crippling load ofdata.andM;For example, a VGA screen with 640 by 480 pixels has 307,200 graphic pointsto control.andP;  If each point can have one of 256 colors, graphics present aforbidding burden of 300K bytes per screen.andP;  This requires more than 25percent of an entire Ethernet channel just to update the full screen once persecond.andM;For a flicker-free image, updated at 72 times per second, an Ethernet channelis completely saturated with fewer than 6 percent of those pixels subject tochange on each cycle -- for example, dragging a box less than 2 inches squarearound the screen with the mouse.andP;  This direct control of each pixel on aremote display is therefore an unacceptable waste of precious networkbandwidth and also locks software into a particular hardware model of thegraphics display.andM;The X Window System breaks this data bottleneck by separating desktopgraphics into two distinct tasks: application processing and userinteraction.andM;To achieve this, X Windows reverses the usual sense of the terms &quot;client&quot; and&quot;server.&quot; In most networks, servers are shared devices and clients sit on thedesktop.andP;  Under X Windows, servers furnish well-behaved desktop portals foruse by application clients, which may reside on the same machine or on anyother machine supporting X Windows connectivity.andM;The client application, rather than tweaking pixels directly, draws graphicsvia calls to a standard library called Xlib.andP;  This library is available inAda, C, FORTRAN, Modula-2 and Pascal.andM;Xlib contains high-level procedures such as XDrawArc, and also encapsulateslow-level functions with procedures such as XDrawPoint that ensure consistenttreatment of data structures.andP;  Other Xlib functions, such as XCreateWindow,control window operations; still others provide a standard interface tointeractive devices such as the keyboard and the pointer (typically a mouse).andM;The client application calls Xlib, which in turn calls the operating systemof the client platform to create and transmit X Windows messages.andP;  To draw asegmented line, for example, the message begins with an operation code of 65,followed by codes for the coordinate system to be used and the way that thedrawing should be made.andP;  Then, the message lists the points to be connected.andM;Though indirect, this is far more concise than sending raw data for everypixel in that line, which is what would have to be done without a protocollike X Windows.andM;The X Windows messages can go across a network to another machine or can berouted through a multitasking operating system to do their work on the localdisplay of that same computer.andP;  The client application need not know which isthe case.andM;X Marks Many SpotsandM;Here is one key difference between X Windows and other graphics applicationprogramming interfaces (APIs), such as Windows or OS/2 Presentation Manager(PM).andP;  If a program tells Windows or PM to draw a circle on-screen, it canproceed on the assumption that this was done.andM;By contrast, X Windows is designed to operate not just in the immediateenvironment of a single machine, but also over relatively slow anderror-prone wide area networks.andM;A single user's machine may be running both local and remote applications; XWindows, therefore, supports a strict and robust protocol of request andconfirmation, taking nothing for granted.andM;When the operating system -- with or without a network's aid -- delivers themessage to the X server, the server figures out when and how to use thatmessage on the display that is actually available.andM;For example, the window for the task receiving that message may currently behidden by other windows.andP;  The server is not just a passive translator, but anactive enforcer of the user's screen-management policy.andM;A client application &quot;hints&quot; at its wishes, such as a window of a certainsize and the location on the screen, but the server's window managerdetermines whether and how this request can be satisfied -- perhaps bychanging the sizes of existing windows, or by collapsing them to icons, or byletting them be obscured by a new foreground window.andM;This is a major benefit of X Windows: It lets a window-manager program,controlled by the user, coordinate applications that may be running onseveral different machines with no direct interaction between thoseapplications.andM;X Windows provides extraordinary power, but that power is not aimed in anyparticular direction.andM;In particular, X Windows does not impose any standard look and feel onapplications.andP;  The X Windows function that draws a rectangle may be called tocreate a check box in a user-interface dialogue, or the programmer may choosea circle for that purpose.andM;One programmer may use squares for check boxes and circles for mutuallyexclusive &quot;radio buttons&quot;; another may use the opposite convention.andP;  Both maybe writing perfectly good, perfectly portable X Windows applications, butanyone using both programs will find the screen a chaos of inconsistentcomponents.andM;To fully exploit the multitasking potential of multiwindow user interaction,users have come to expect that their applications will follow consistentrules of appearance and behavior.andP;  ATandamp;T's Open Look and the Open SoftwareFoundation's (OSF's) Motif are the dominant GUI styles for applicationsdevelopment under X Windows.andM;The choice between Open Look and Motif is not entirely left to either theuser or the developer.andP;  The user can choose a Motif or Open Look windowmanager, which determines the appearance and behavior of window decorations(such as borders) and controls (such as scroll bars), but the applicationdeveloper determines the appearance and function of what takes place insidethose windows -- for example, the style of dialogue boxes.andM;This is where X Windows crosses the line from open-ended architecture tospecific commercial products.andP;  Developers compete to offer the bestcombination of standard X Windows' benefits along with distinctive featuresfor ease of user interaction and more rapid application development.andM;One dimension of competition among X Windows developers is access to end-userplatforms.andP;  Until recently, DOS-based PCs could only be used as X servers ifthey gave up their other local functions, but several vendors now support XWindows sessions within popular DOS multitasking environments.andM;Under Microsoft Windows 3.0, VisionWare Ltd., of Leeds, England, offersXVision 3.0 for side-by-side operation (including cut-and-paste transfer ofdata) between remote X Windows applications and local Windows 3.0 tasks.andM;A complementary product, PC-Connect, from the same developer, lets remoteUnix applications use the Microsoft Windows API to take full advantage ofWindows graphics, user interface and Dynamic Data Exchange with otherapplications.andP;  This makes for a consistent appearance throughout the user'senvironment, but makes the application Windows-specific rather than beingusable from any X server.andM;XVision is priced at $449.andP;  Beginning Nov.andP;  1, pricing for the run-timesystem of PC-Connect 6.01 starts at $1,140 for a two-user system on a PCworkstation and varies according to hardware configuration.andP;  Prices for thedevelopment system start at $2,300.andM;VisionWare can be reached at (44532) 788-858.andM;Quarterdeck Office Systems has been even more aggressive in bringing XWindows under the umbrella of its Desqview multitasking environment, buildingits entire 1990 developers conference in August around the theme &quot;Bringing XWindows to DOS.&quot;andM;Quarterdeck's next-generation Desqview/X, slated for general release laterthis year, was evaluated in prerelease form by PC Week Labs and proved to bea robust and flexible package.andM;Layered ModelandM;In a particularly vivid demonstration of the layered model of X Windows,Desqview/X showed the ability to switch from one window manager to anotherwithout disturbing the running applications, changing the style of windowborders and controls at will.andP;  Desqview/X will serve as an X clientenvironment and a workstation X server, letting PC users share the power of486 and high-end 386 machines across an entire network.andM;Quarterdeck can be reached in Santa Monica, Calif., at (213) 392-9851.andM;The benefits of X Windows are perhaps best realized in the relativelyunrestricted memory and wide-open display of a fully configured workstation,and, in the past year, Sun Microsystems Inc. has aggressively lowered theentry-level price of its RISC-based Scalable Processor Architecture machines,known as SPARCstations.andP;  Sun began bundling the latest version of its XWindows-compatible OpenWindows environment with hard-disk models in lateJuly.andM;The new OpenWindows release, version 2, provides 3-D effects to compete withthe attractive esthetics of OSF's Motif, and is much faster than the earlierversions -- fast enough, Sun officials hope, to wean users away from the lessflexible SunView windowing system that Sun had previously favored.andM;OpenWindows includes the XView tool kit, which supports both new developmentand the migration of existing SunView applications.andP;  Sun officials claimedthat there were 2,800 of these applications available as of July.andM;Sun can be reached in Mountain View, Calif., at (800) 821-4643.andP;  WithinCalifornia, the number is (800) 821-4642.andM;One former SunView application was IsoFax, from the Bristol Group Ltd. inLondonderry, N.H.andP;  This $995 application provides workstation-based facsimiletransmission and receipt, as well as a sender/recipient database, and letsfax machines be used as page scanners.andM;The Bristol Group can be contacted at (603) 437-3700.andM;XView's support for the migration of SunView applications to Open Look isespecially important because SunView holds such a lead in the installed baseof windows-oriented workstation applications, with almost 30 times theapplications base of Open Look (which in turn has roughly triple the base ofMotif), according to independently published figures.andM;Sun has announced plans to offer XView versions for DEC, Hewlett-Packard Co.andO;and IBM Unix workstations as well as for PCs and minicomputers.andP;  A VAX/VMSversion of XView is slated for December delivery by TGV Inc., a developer inSanta Cruz, Calif.andM;TGV can be reached at (408) 427-4360.andP;  XView is even included, at noadditional cost, in the X11 tape that MIT uses to distribute X Windows.andM;Informix Software Inc.'s Wingz spreadsheet, which is designed for Sun'sworkstations, is one of the mainstream desktop applications now supportingOpen Look.andP;  The $699 spreadsheet requires SunView or the compatible mode ofOpenWindows.andM;Informix can be contacted in Menlo Park, Calif., at (415) 926-6300.andM;Looking ahead, Sun has been contracted by the X Windows Consortium, theassociation that owns the copyright on X Windows, to design an important Xextension, PEX, for enhanced 3-D graphics (not just 3-D user-interfacedecorations) under a future X Windows release.andM;PEX is a multilevel acronym for PHIGS Extension to X, where PHIGS denotes theProgrammers Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System.andM;Though OSF's Motif currently lags far behind in available applications, ithas deep-pocketed sponsors and will likely remain a sizable market.andO;Developers can have it both ways, supporting both Open Look and Motifenvironments, with the aid of development tools such as ExoCode from ExpertObject Corp., in Lincolnwood, Ill.andM;Motif developers can use ExoCode/ SXM, while Open Look developers can useExoCode/Plus.andP;  Either provides a visual interface that builds the outer shellof a program through the same kind of GUI operations that will later be usedto run it, greatly reducing the programmer's burden of learning internaldetails of each standard.andM;Prices for ExoCode begin at $1,495 for the first user and drop incrementallyto $500 each for the fourth and subsequent users.andP;  Expert Object Corp. can bereached at (708) 676-5555.andM;Even if individual applications enjoy GUI ease of use, an unattractiveneighborhood can still depress the property values of isolated programs.andM;A prime example of this was the poor acceptance of Windows applications whenthey were embedded in the crude environment of the MS-DOS Executive ofWindows 2.X and earlier versions, compared with the enthusiastic reception ofWindows 3.0 with its elegant File Manager and Program Manager front ends.andM;Similarly, X Windows gets a strong boost in user acceptance from theattractive visual shell of products such as Looking Glass, a Motif-style GUIenvironment from Visix Software Inc., of Reston, Va.andP;  With a graphical filetree for ease of navigation, a named workspace feature for ease of managingsets of tasks and hypertext-style help, Looking Glass eliminates any basisfor criticizing Unix as intrinsically hard to use.andP;  With versions for bothSunView and X Windows, Looking Glass helps smooth over the idiosyncraticdifferences that have plagued the Unix marketplace.andM;Looking Glass costs between $595 and $1,295, depending on the hardware.andP;  Theproduct is also bundled by a number of OEMs, including Data General Corp. inits AViiON workstations, and is also offered by Solbourne Computer Inc., amaker of Sun-compatible systems.andM;Visix can be reached at (800) 832-8668.andM;Another aid to end users is X.desktop, from IXI Ltd., of Cambridge, England.andO;Its Motif-style product, priced at $495, has been adopted by IBM (for AIX onthe RS/6000 workstations), by Tektronix Inc. (for its RISC-based workstationsand dedicated X terminals), and by Japanese manufacturers NEC Corp., thePanasonic division of Matshushita Electric Industrial group and Omron Corp.andM;IXI can be reached at (44223) 462-131.andM;X Windows raises Unix users to PC standards of visual appeal and ease of use,at the same time giving PC users the networked versatility and vendorindependence that have made Unix increasingly competitive in commercialmarkets.andM;With its ability to make the link between powerful computational resourcesand convenient user interaction, X Windows will be a vital crossroads forcomputing in the 1990s.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
