Speaking at the Sunday graduation ceremonies of the Philippine Military Academy, she gave her &quot;solemn oath&quot; that before her term is over, &quot;One nation, one armed forces, acting with the energy and direction of a single hand will smite the foe, on the left and on the right. . . .&quot;    We hope Americans, especially Americans in Congress, were listening. Mrs. Aquino, at great risk, had made an intense yearlong effort to negotiate with the Communists. She now knows that democratic processes are antithetical to Communist beliefs and that they will accept nothing short of total power. Surely members of Congress who plead daily for &quot;negotiations&quot; with Communists in Angola, Afghanistan or Nicaragua can learn from her experience. But why must the lesson be relearned so often?    The more immediate question, however, is whether Congress will back Mrs. Aquino. She wants a mere $50 million in military aid to supplement the $50 million Congress had voted for this year. That would give her the $100 million President Reagan originally requested.    Mrs. Aquino tried every avenue to peace. Just after taking office, she released some of the New People's Army leaders jailed by former President Ferdinand Marcos. The Communists went on killing. Then she gave amnesty to some insurgent leaders so that they could negotiate a truce with the government. The killing continued. Finally there was a 90-day &quot;cease-fire.&quot; The killing slowed, but it did not stop.    During this year of compromise, the number of violent incidents dropped, but the proportion initiated by the NPA rose to more than two-thirds. The forbearance Mrs. Aquino demanded of government troops helped fuel right-wing coup attempts against her.    The Communists, who official U.S. sources believe have Soviet support, continued to build strength. U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage told Congress last week that the number of NPA soldiers rose 9% in 1986, to 24,430. Their territorial grip expanded by some 21% to about one-fifth of all rural districts.    The NPA guerrillas are ruthless. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur told Congress last week of an incident in the community of Lupao, in which NPA guerrillas &quot;apparently fired at the soldiers from the shelter of occupied civilian homes&quot; resulting in 17 civilian casualties.    According to Mr. Armitage, the Philippine military is desperately short on basic equipment: trucks, helicopters and radios. One of our friends who visits the Philippine troops says even their shoes aren't in good shape.    U.S. aid can provide the most direct possible defense of democracy in the Philippines. It will also preserve Philippine support for U.S. military bases at Clark Air Field and Subic Bay. These are vital to the defense of the Asian Pacific, where the Soviets are expanding their might.    Mrs. Aquino isn't asking for much. If she doesn't get it we will know that the serious conduct of U.S. foreign policy is in worse trouble in Congress than even we had imagined. </TEXT></DOC>
