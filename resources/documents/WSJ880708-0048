Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board sharply boosted its projection of the cost of resolving the thrift crisis, shaking the confidence of lawmakers in its effectiveness.    Bank Board Chairman Danny Wall told the House Banking Committee that merging or closing insolvent Texas thrifts would cost $15.2 billion, more than double his previous estimate of $7 billion. He also raised to $42.5 billion, from $30.2 billion, the amount of cash that he expects the Bank Board to raise in the next decade to deal with the thrift crisis.    House members and thrift industry officials voiced surprise and shock. Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.) said the sharp change in estimates &quot;scares the hell out of me.&quot;    The new cost estimates bring his figures closer to other projections and is likely to increase pressure within Congress to provide additional funding for the Bank Board to deal with insolvent thrifts, although such action is unlikely this year. Mr. Wall's acknowledgment that he has underestimated the costs also could fuel Democratic charges that the current board has been minimizing the problem for political reasons.    Charles Koch, chairman of the National Council of Savings Institutions, bitterly protested Mr. Wall's statement that he would extend through 1998 the special assessment that increases thrift insurance costs to 2 1/2 times the level banks pay for federal insurance. That would expose healthy thrifts to a &quot;bottomless pit of unprofitability,&quot; he charged.    Theo Pitt, chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, was dismayed at the fees projection and &quot;confused&quot; by the Bank Board's rapidly changing numbers. He said they &quot;raise questions&quot; about whether the board is dealing effectively with the thrift crisis.    Even before Mr. Wall's testimony, most of the thrift industry was angry and concerned about the special assessment. A law enacted last year called for it to be phased out between 1987 and 1991. The Bank Board has used its authority to defer the reduction on the grounds that the money is needed urgently. In June, Mr. Wall projected continuing the full fees through 1995. Yesterday, he tacked on three more years, adding $6.7 billion to the Bank Board's special collections.    Mr. Wall, in his testimony, conceded that the industry would have to &quot;struggle&quot; to pay the continuing fees, and his tone was far less optimistic than in past testimony. But he refused to recommend whether Congress should tap taxpayer funds to carry part of this burden.    Mr. Wall said he raised his cost estimate for insolvent Texas thrifts because they are taking unexpectedly large loan write-downs and the Bank Board -- assisted mergers there so far this year have cost the board about twice what it expected.    Until yesterday, Mr. Wall had projected that the Bank Board could merge or close about 500 insolvent thrifts nationwide at a cost of about $22.7 billion. Yesterday's figures raise that to $30.9 billion, Bank Board staffers said, and further reviews of writedowns outside of Texas may raise the total further.    By comparison, Congress's General Accounting Office had put the cost at about $26 billion to $36 billion, while other analysts' estimates run as high as $75 billion.    Several lawmakers suggested the Bank Board's estimates remain optimistic, and that its goal is simply to delay a showdown on the thrift crisis until next year for political reasons. &quot;It's fairly clear that there is an increase of frustration and even a growing lack of confidence in the Bank Board,&quot; said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). </TEXT></DOC>
