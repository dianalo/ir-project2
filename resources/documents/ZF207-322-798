Things get even more complicated when thetransmission involves several EDI networks.andM;EDI also falls down in providing proof of delivery.andP;  By using registered orcertified mail, you get a return receipt indicating that your letter actuallyreached the addressee.andP;  However, at present there are no uniform standards toconfirm that an EDI document has been received, much less by the rightperson.andP;  For transactions that demand this kind of proof, EDI may flunk thelegal test.andM;If the U.S.andP;  mail or an overnight express service doesn't deliver a contractto the right addressee, it is clearly responsible for any business lossescaused by the error.andP;  But the courts haven't decided who is liable if an EDInetwork transmits a document to the wrong party.andM;The Postal Service motto is &quot;Rain, sleet, snow or hail, the mail must getthrough.&quot;andP;  When weather or other &quot;acts of nature&quot; keep it from gettingthrough as quickly as you might like, you can at least show that you made agood-faith effort to get your document to the addressee on time.andM;What if an EDI network goes down because its host computer gets spiked bylightning or because there's a flood in the computer room?andP;  Although thesesituations qualify as acts of nature, the good-faith argument may not standup as a jurisdiction for late delivery of EDI messages, especially ifnegligence or human error contributed to the delay.andM;Whose Fault Is It?andM;Likewise, if United Parcel Service doesn't deliver your business documents ontime because one of its trucks breaks down, UPS may be liable if you losemoney.andP;  It's not yet clear who picks up the tab for EDI malfunctions.andM;Moreover, under the law, a document is far more private than an electronicmessage.andP;  Whether you send contracts, bills or business documents by the U.S.andO;Postal Service or by Federal Express, the courier has a legal obligation toguard the document's privacy.andP;  It's a serious crime to open the envelope of aletter that's in transit.andM;So far, there's no law to protect the privacy of EDI communications, and thecourts haven't made any moves in this direction.andP;  The only way to safeguardEDI transmissions is to encrypt the data.andM;You'd probably have to do some kind of encryption anyway, because an EDInetwork is no more bulletproof than any other computer system.andP;  The questionof who is liable for security breaches is bound to come up.andP;  If there areprivacy or security violations in paper-based transactions, the courts canuse established guidelines to determine liability.andP;  No such standards existfor EDI transactions.andM;As you know, it's possible to analyze a signature on a document to determinewhether it's authentic.andP;  Although there's a movement to accept electronicsignatures as binding, the courts aren't convinced yet of their reliability.andO;Detecting an electronic &quot;forgery&quot; can be difficult if several parties haveaccess to the same electronic key, so the courts prefer written signatures asindexes of authenticity.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
