The lawyer's offense? He had persisted in asking the judge to handle a case that the latter had no wish to take on.    In nearby Shaanxi province, a judge threw a robbery suspect's attorney out of court. The reason: The attorney had exposed glaring faults in the prosecution's evidence.    A lawyer on Hainan island was arrested on the orders of the public prosecutor's office and detained for a month on charges of &quot;conspiring with the accused&quot; because of his staunch defense.    Defense lawyers in China don't have it easy. Since they were allowed back into the courts nearly a decade ago, they have been attacked, persecuted and arrested, and their work has been obstructed by Communist Party and government officials.    In the past two years, the Chinese press has highlighted many cases in which lawyers have been harassed, hoping to persuade party and government departments to guarantee lawyers the right to carry out their duties.    But there aren't any signs that attacks on lawyers have abated. Since early 1985, when the media began pushing the government to support the legal profession, 30 cases of abuse have been reported. Experts say the number of unreported cases is much higher.    &quot;There have been continual attacks, persecution of lawyers and obstruction and harassment of them in their attempts to deal with public matters according to the law,&quot; the People's Daily said.    The indifference or outright hostility of those in power toward lawyers makes them vulnerable to such attacks, officials in China's justice system say. Often, party and government officials look down on lawyers as bent only on getting criminals off the hook.    &quot;Some officials think that they are the authority. They don't have the concept of rule of law. They don't understand that their authority is checked by the law,&quot; says Fu Zhiren, vice president of the Beijing Lawyers Association. &quot;We have to fight with these people. If they deserve punishment, they should be punished.&quot;    Chinese lawyers -- who were ridiculed and purged during the anti-rightist campaign in 1957 and the 10-year Cultural Revolution, which ended in 1976 -- were allowed into courts again after Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978. Apart from the intimidation they have endured since then, their working conditions are rugged and their income and status low.    Graduates fresh from a university law department are assigned to work in courts, public-security bureaus or law firms; they rarely have the right to choose. Lawyers say office space generally is inadequate. In the Xicheng District Legal Consultants Office, four attorneys share a room of about five square yards.    They are state employees with wage levels similar to those of workers. Starting salaries are roughly the same as what a junior-grade civil servant earns: the equivalent of $20 a month.    &quot;Our income isn't compatible with the heavy work load,&quot; says Liu Guifeng, a lawyer with Beijing's Xicheng District Legal Consultants Office. But apparently it is hard to change the pay structure, which is set by the state. &quot;If the wage gap is too big between lawyers and other state employees, some people will resent it,&quot; Ms. Liu says.    Despite the workload, most law-department graduates pursue the profession. One advantage they have over government prosecutors and judges is that they get bonuses. More than offsetting that is a disadvantage: They must wait much longer, sometimes for years, to get housing.    The legal profession's status has remained low because many people associate lawyers with &quot;those who speak for criminals,&quot; a lawyer here says. In China, guilt is often presumed when defendants are brought to court. To raise lawyers' image, Beijing officials have weighed granting them professional titles equivalent to engineers or lecturers. Another proposal suggests that lawyers be graded according to their experience and performance, with grades equivalent to professor, associate professor and lecturer.    There also have been suggestions that lawyers should be made independent of the state apparatus, Chinese lawyers say. Lin Hengyuan, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, says that lawyers should be able to work independently and not be cadres of the judiciary. The conference advises the central government on policy matters.    Some lawyers say that if they are put outside state control, they'll compete with one another and their rivalry will improve quality of service.    On the other hand, Li Duanxu, another Beijing lawyer, contends that the present &quot;state employee&quot; system works well. The justice departments serve as supervisors but they don't interfere with lawyers' work, he says. Mr. Fu of the Beijing Lawyers Association adds: &quot;The system is suitable for China because lawyers aren't influenced by money. Without the influence of money, lawyers can insist on truth.&quot;    Lawyers here also complain about the shortage of attorneys. &quot;It's far, far from enough,&quot; says Wang Kezhong, a Beijing lawyer. Today, 20,000 lawyers serve a population of more than one billion. China plans to increase the number to 70,000 by 1990; already, in Beijing, the number has increased to 1,300 from just 40 in 1979.    Of the 1,300, however, only 500 work full-time. The rest are professors, legal researchers and retired judges.    Despite the difficulties, many lawyers see their status going up as China's legal education expands. They reason that when more people understand the importance of the rule of law, they will pay more respect to lawyers.    &quot;My kids are proud of my being a lawyer,&quot; Mr. Fu says. &quot;Nobody thinks it's a shame to be in this profession anymore. It's different from the Cultural Revolution days.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
