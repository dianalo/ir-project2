But the members of the second group, none of whom was a survivor's child, requested elaboration.    Alas, the child of Holocaust survivors grows up with questions, responsibilities and burdens that are outside the experience of most Americans: Why don't I have grandparents, uncles, aunts? Why don't other kids' parents have tattooed numerals on their arms? How did my parents survive? Could I have done so? And, inevitably: Must I be my parents' justification?    Often, the atmosphere that gives rise to such questions can move the child to seek release through creative expression. For Art Spiegelman, who grew up in the home of Holocaust survivors in New York City, cartooning brought such a release. While still a teen-ager, Mr. Spiegelman began working for Topps Chewing Gum Inc. (for whom, more recently, he helped develop the enormously successful &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; trading cards). He became an important figure in the American &quot;underground&quot; comics movement, and, since 1980, he has co-edited Raw, the international avant-garde comics magazine.    Now 38, Mr. Spiegelman has released his &quot;magnum opus,&quot; &quot;Maus: A Survivor's Tale&quot; (Pantheon, 160 pages, $8.95), dedicated to his late mother, Anja. The comic book presents the story of Mr. Spiegelman's father, Vladek, in Poland from the mid-1930s until Vladek and Anja found themselves at the gates of Auschwitz in the winter of 1944.    The Jews of &quot;Maus&quot; are depicted as mice, sequestered in a separate world, estranged from other Poles (depicted as pigs), from Germans (cats) and from everyone else (various other animals). In Mr. Spiegelman's hands, this metaphor successfully transforms Europe into a giant mousetrap built by cats for the extermination of mice.    Although Mr. Spiegelman's father narrates most of &quot;Maus&quot; -- in a broken English that arouses sympathy and compassion -- the artist himself narrates the opening frames. Those frames make clear that the survivor's estrangement has been transmitted from father to son. Mr. Spiegelman recalls an innocuous boyhood incident: He falls while roller-skating, then tearily informs his father that his friends skated away without him. &quot;Friends?&quot; the survivor asks his son. &quot;Your friends? If you lock them together in a room with no food for a week, THEN you could see what it is, friends!&quot; The little mouse-friends are American Jews, but imbued with the survivor's perspective the child feels estranged even from them. This isn't the sort of wisdom that Ward Cleaver imparted to his young son on &quot;Leave It to Beaver.&quot;    Within this strong subplot of the tortured relationship between father and son, Mr. Spiegelman inserts a four-page relic -- his 1972 comic &quot;Prisoner on the Hell Planet: A Case History.&quot; It recounts the trauma surrounding the most significant incident in his young life, his mother's suicide in 1968. The suicide occurred when Mr. Spiegelman was 20 years old, and just three months after he had been released to his parents' custody from a mental hospital. His mother left no note.    On several levels, &quot;Maus&quot; boldly breaks new ground. This comic book is also biography, history and psychosocial profile. It is the first comic book to dare to address the Holocaust, and it presents the experience of the Jews in Nazi Europe authentically. It is unique as an unsentimentally honest portrayal by a survivor's child of his parent. And, except for a short story by Franz Kafka, it is the first literature to present Jews as mice.    Still, by reducing the Jews of Nazi Europe to comic-book characters, Mr. Spiegelman has not entirely avoided the danger of oversimplification: After months of degradation and hunger, his mice appear as stout as when we met them in pre-war Poland.    In his quest for reportorial accuracy, Mr. Spiegelman betrays his father's trust on occasion. But he does so candidly, thus making the historical narrative all the more believable. The climax of this volume is reached on the final pages -- not only because Mr. Spiegelman's parents arrive at Auschwitz, but because the survivor's own betrayal of his son is revealed.    Vladek Spiegelman did not live to see his life become a book, and he surely would not have been pleased by all of it. (A sequel that takes the artist's parents through Auschwitz is in the works.) But if the son was motivated in part by revenge against his father, he remained a &quot;parent to his parent&quot; by protecting the integrity of his father's story. This integrity on every level ensures that &quot;Maus,&quot; as its protagonist did, will survive.    ---   Mr. Preston, a reporter with the Philadelphia Inquirer, is a child of Holocaust survivors. </TEXT></DOC>
