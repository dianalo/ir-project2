More precisely, the relationship between the energy flux densitycarried by gravitational radiation and the mass loss of the source dueto gravitational radiation is studied. This study is performed with theBondi formalism. The Bondi formalism is reviewed and some of its predictionsare examined in detail through a perturbative analysis. In addition,the Bondi formalism is compared to another, more familiar, formalismin order to gain a better understanding of how the generation of gravitationalradiation is related to the motion of the source. Part Two consideredthe problem of a spherically symmetric, massless scalar field interactingwith gravity via Einstein's field equations in a three-dimensional space-time.The imposition of spherical symmetry makes this a minisuperspace model.The model is quantized by splitting space-time into space and time viathe ADM procedure, and then imposing canonical commutation relations.Since this is a minisuperspace model, a comparison is made of such modelsto models with no imposed symmetry in flat space-time.</TEXT></DOC>
