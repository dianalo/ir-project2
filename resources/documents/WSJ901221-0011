Regional variations are still very large, but they may bedwindling slightly. All through the 1970s and 1980s, housingprices on the East Coast and in California far outstrippedthe national averages. Today the trend is beginning toreverse. Prices are holding up better in the heartland.Following are reports from six communities, which generallysupport the idea of slowly converging prices:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   SEATTLE:   Roller-Coaster Prices                                                                                                          Seattle real estate has had a roller-coaster ride over thepast couple of years. Prices skyrocketed in the late 1980s,but have recently begun falling back to earth.   &quot;The Seattle area is a fascinating market because thingsare happening so fast, it's like a decade being crammed intotwo years,&quot; says Jim Hebert, the president of Hebert ResearchInc., a research firm in Bellevue, Wash.   Redmond, Wash., is an eastside suburban Seattle communityof about 33,000 that is typical of the way prices have risenand fallen. Real-estate agents point to one house, on themarket for $244,000. But over the past year, agents say, thevalue of such a house has gone from $225,000 to $280,000 andback down again to the current level.   It is a 3,060-square-foot two-year-old eight-room housewith four bedrooms, a terrace deck, a kitchen with Europeancabinets, digital appliances and a walk-in pantry. It has athree-car garage, a formal dining room, 2 1/2 baths, a familyroom with a fireplace, gas heat and a spacious lawn.   Over the past several years, rapid population growth,particularly from equity-rich Californians, and job growth inthe business sector fueled real-estate speculation in theSeattle suburbs that inflated most homes well beyond theirsustainable value, according to Barbara McElveny, the secondvice president of the Seattle King County Association ofRealtors.   &quot;When the market rose 37% in 1989, people jumped on thebandwagon to take advantage of the appreciation,&quot; says Mrs.McElveny.   The price fall is particularly evident at the high end,because there was more speculation in that market segment.For example, Mrs. McElveny says a Realtor she knows justpurchased a waterfront home on Lake Washington in anexclusive neighborhood. It sold for $900,000, but the listedprice for the home was $1.4 million, she says.   On the east side, $250,000 will buy much more than it dideight months ago. Typically, it will get you, at minimum, athree-bedroom home, she says. At the low end, there is stilla shortage of housing in the under-$200,000 price range, butif the buyer psychology continues to worsen, houses may comeavailable for first-time buyers.   &quot;The housing market just turned a somersault from thefirst quarter and continued to decline throughout the year,&quot;says Mr. Hebert of the research firm.   Mr. Hebert says the suburban Seattle housing market willdecline as much as 20% between now and the late spring beforeleveling out and starting to reflect &quot;normal&quot; real-estateprices in the area.   -- Chip Johnson   ---   NAPERVILLE, ILL.:   Slow but Steady                                                                                                          In Naperville, Ill., a distant suburb of Chicago, priceshave held fairly steady over the past year, although themarket is beginning to feel a glut of higher-end houses. Herein Naperville, a $250,000 house is at the upper end of thehousing spectrum.   A typical $250,000 house would be a four-bedroom, 21/2-bath, 3,000-square-foot Georgian or colonial home on aquarter-acre lot in an upscale subdivision. It would almostcertainly have a master bedroom suite including a bath with awhirlpool and seperate shower; brick fireplace, central airconditioning, first-floor den and family room, large kitchenwith custom cabinets and ceramic-tile floors, a full basementand a three-car garage.   Prices for this type of home are about unchanged from late1989. In Du Page County, where Naperville is located, pricesfor all detached, single-family houses are up 3.23% -- lessthan the rate of inflation -- compared with annual priceincreases of about 5% to 13% from 1984 through 1988,according to the Du Page Association of Realtors.   &quot;We're far better off here in the Midwest than the rest ofthe nation,&quot; says Richard Gardner, a Realtor with ERA DupreefRealty in Naperville. &quot;The rate of {market} growth has sloweddown a little, but there's no decrease in value here.&quot;   One reason is that the market was relatively stable duringthe 1980s real-estate boom, with price rises of about 40%versus 100% in, say, New Jersey.   Lately, however, traffic at the high end has slowed. Ittakes 60 to 90 days to sell a house now, compared with 50 to60 days a year earlier. Upper- and middle-management layoffsand a slowdown in employee transfers at corporate offices inthe area have thrust more houses in the $250,000-and-up rangeonto the market. (Naperville, which locals call &quot;the fastestgrowing noncoastal community in the U.S.,&quot; is home to dozensof major corporate offices, including an ATandamp;T regional centerwith more than 8,000 employees.)   &quot;In our office, we have noticed a lot of upper-end homesstarting to sell,&quot; says Dan Shanahan, branch manager atColdwell Banker's Naperville office. &quot;But this is not adisaster. It's nowhere near a disaster.&quot;   The slowdown has pinched builders of more expensive homes,particularly those that sold houses contingent on the sale ofthe buyers current residence. Prices have fallen on builders'models and custom-built homes in some subdivisions. TwoNaperville homes sold in a real-estate auction last monthwere sharply reduced from their original listing-price. Abuilder's model priced at $699,000 sold for $485,000, and ahome listed at $395,000 went for $295,000.   -- Sue Shellenbarger   ---   RIDGEWOOD, N.J.:   After the Free Fall                                                                                                          Housing prices in this largely white-collar commuter townhave fallen about 30% in the last three years, but realestate agents say they should stabilize this year.   &quot;We've almost leveled off,&quot; says William Gilsenan Jr.,owner of Gilsenan Co., a local real-estate firm. &quot;Withinterest rates coming down, we should see greater activitythis year.&quot;   At the moment, bargains abound in Ridgewood, a quiet townof 25,000 located 12 miles outside New York City. &quot;Basicallyfor $250,000 you get a nice little house on a nice littlelot. Nothing fancy,&quot; says Catherine Sperte, a representativeof Century 21. That's in marked contrast to a couple of yearsago, when anyone with less than $300,000 to spend was told tolook somewhere else.   While it will hardly buy a mansion, $250,000 clearly goesa lot further in Ridgewood today than a year ago. Then,sellers were still determined to hold out for the fat profitsthat rolled in during the boom market of the 1980s. Moreoften than not, they found their homes sitting on the marketfor months.   Generally, real estate brokers say $250,000 will now buy acolonial-style house with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, aone-car garage, on a 50-foot-by-130 foot lot. Cape style orsplit-level homes, considered somewhat less desirable,generally offer more house (say an additional bedroom orbathroom) for the same money.   In a typical example, one colonial style, stone framehouse with four bedrooms and 2 1/2 bathrooms went on themarket last August for just under $300,000. Months passed andthere were no serious nibbles, so the sellers recentlyslashed the asking price to $249,000. Although the househasn't sold yet, real-estate agents say that now that theprice is more realistic it should go fairly quickly. &quot;Housesthat are priced right sell well,&quot; says Arlene Dodd, a salesrepresentative with Schlott Realtors in Ridgewood.   To a great extent, Ridgewood's housing market mirrors thefortunes of New York City, particularly Wall Street. Soaringfor most of the 1980s, housing prices started tumbling afterthe stock market crash of 1987, falling by some estimates ata rate of 1% per month.   Brokers here like to argue that since the area took itslumps earlier than the rest of the country, the worst isover. Despite their relatively upbeat tone now, there are noguarantees that the Ridgewood market has bottomed, especiallygiven the uncertain economic situation.   Already, prices have fallen enough to encourage first-timebuyers, who once couldn't dream of house-hunting inRidgewood. In fact, most of the recent activity has been inhouses costing under $300,000, while more expensive homeslanguish on the market.   -- Kathryn Graven   ---   ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:   Slightly Cheaper                                                                                                          Home buyers looking for a $250,000 home in the OrangeCounty region of Southern California will find that theirmoney buys them more this year --  although not a huge amountmore.   &quot;It looks like people are getting better deals in 1990compared with 1989. In terms of square footage, they'regetting more house for the money,&quot; says Martin C. Dee,spokesman for TRW Real Estate Information Services inAnaheim, Calif.   A TRW survey of homes sold in Orange County in Octobershows more houses in the larger 1,500- to 2,000-square-footcategory than a year ago. Likewise, prices have dropped. Theaverage sale price of a home in October was $236,421, a 9.1%drop from the year-earlier $260,180.   &quot;Part of what we're telling owners is that if you don'thave to sell, don't.&quot; The market just isn't good. It's thatsimple,&quot; says Realtor Pat Neal of Copper Penny Real Estate inGarden Grove, Calif.   Still, the softness is a matter of perception. In thetree-lined Garden Park tract of Garden Grove, about 30 milessouth of Los Angeles, $250,000 will get you a 26-year-oldCalifornia ranch style home with four bedrooms and 1 3/4baths. Total square footage is a smallish 1,450. A year ago,that same home would have cost just $10,000 more.   &quot;In the higher price ranges, we've seen more of a drop inprice because of the slower market, but it hasn't affectedhome in the $250,000 range that much,&quot; says Marnie O'Brien,senior marketing consultant for Grubb andamp; Ellis in Irvine,where prices in that range have only dropped about 2% to 5%.In Irvine, $250,000 will buy a five-year-old home with threebedrooms and 1,500 square feet.   What has changed more is the amount of time propertiesspend on the market. The selling time for a $250,000 home inIrvine is around 60 days now, half that of a year ago. InGarden Grove, Ms. Neal says, the average time on the markethas been as high as 122 days. Overall, the housing market isslowing in Orange County: from July to September, 1,712 unitswere sold, compared with 2,037 in the second quarter, a 16%in the second quarter, a 16% drop, according to Meyers Groupreal-estate consultants in Corona, Calif.   The biggest markdowns have occurred in homes priced over$300,000. &quot;You start seeing the sticker spread as you move upin price. That's where you have the real softness and thelonger times to sell,&quot; says Ms. Neal. At the other end of thespectrum, many more houses are listed below $200,000 thesedays -- hardly enough to buy much more than a condo a yearago.   Tentatively, most Realtors say they expect flat toslightly higher prices this time next year.   -- David Jefferson   ---   HOUSTON:   Recovery at Last                                                                                                          In Houston, a quarter of a million dollars practicallybuys a mansion. The Woodlands is a large new community 27miles north of downtown Houston, a favorite of managers inhigh-technology and energy companies. The landscape isheavily wooded, and the money goes a lot farther here than inNew York or California.   A typical $250,000 house has about 3,200 to 3,800 squarefeet, four bedrooms, 3 1/2 baths and at least a two-cargarage. Quarter-acre lots are common. A few of the houseshave swimming pools, and the majority have a Jacuzzi tub asstandard equipment in the master bedroom. The house probablywill have two fireplaces.   The two-story dwelling will likely have a family room orgame room and a den or study downstairs.   Although prices have been rising lately, the gains havebeen slow. The building excesses of the 1980s were so largethat it will still take years to work off inventory.   &quot;Our problem was that we simply built too much, we had anoversupply of real estate,&quot; says Barton Smith, professor ofeconomics at the University of Houston. He adds, however,that &quot;in the past three years the economy has accelerated thepace of the real-estate recovery.&quot;   In Houston the housing market is probably balanced now,although if there is any slant, it's on the side of theseller.   &quot;This is a fairly balanced market, although demand is sogood that it's turning into a seller's market,&quot; David M.Weekley of Weekley Homes Inc., a Texas homebuilder, says.   &quot;In Houston you have about seven years' worth of peoplethat have been held captive in a current house, but the valueis returning now,&quot; he adds. About 10% of the estimated 800homes Mr. Weekley has built this year have been in the$250,000 range, with an average price tag of aobut $300,000.His company has been building homes in the city since 1976.   During its worst times, the Houston real-estate marketdepended heavily upon corporate transferees that could prettymuch be counted on, even as economic and market conditionsworsened.   &quot;It's still a good transferee buyer market,&quot; the37-year-old Mr. Weekley says, &quot;but people are able to movenow. There is a greater demand for move-up homes.&quot;   John A. Daugherty, who estimates that his John DaughertyRealtors has sold about 1,000 houses this year, about 250 ofwhich were in the $250,000 range, thinks that the market ismore balanced today than it has been in 20 years.   There isn't an oversupply or undersupply, but an adequatesupply of housing, Mr Daugherty says.   -- Patricia McKanic   ---   GWINNETT COUNTY, GA.:   A Buyer's Market                                                                                                          In Gwinnett Conty, Ga., the home buyer is king. Shoppersare finding lower prices, a huge inventory of properties, andwilling -- even desperate -- sellers.   In the Atlanta suburb, which in the late 1980s was amongthe fastest-growing counties in the nation, $250,000 will buya large and well-appointed new two-story all-brick home withfour large bedrooms and as many baths on a half-acre to afull-acre wooded lot with lots of extras. In that pricerange, most homes feature a Jacuzzi bath, an outsized deck,and sprinkler and security systems. Vaulted ceilings andstained glass are popular, as are open floor plans and lotsof light.   Buyers in Gwinnett hold all the cards. And they know it.Overbuilding has left the area with a glut of unsold newproperties. Buyers are demanding -- and getting -- loweredsales prices, extras such as high-priced appliances,customized draperies, hardwood floors and favorablefinancing.   Closings on homes in Gwinnett fell 21.6% in the threemonths ended Nov. 30 to 791 homes from 1,009 homes in thesame period of 1989, according to data from MetropolitanMulti-List Inc. in Atlanta. While homes in Gwinnett fetched97.2% of the asking price during the 1989 period, theybrought only 95.7% of it for the 1990 period. &quot;They'recutting the prices this year and selling fewer homes,&quot; saysJohn Hanes, a broker at Century 21 in Lilburn in Gwinnett.   Ida Shelton, an agent with Sports Realty Inc., remembersthe glory days of 1986, when homes in Gwinnett were sellingas fast as they could be built. &quot;We were sitting back takingorders. We had more than we could cope with. People would askus to take a house in trade, and we'd laugh. We werearrogant. You're seeing humble now.&quot;   Chances are buyers will be able to get at least as muchhome next December as they can now. Agents who used to stressthe virtual guarantee of appreciation now market homes morefor their comforts, the pride of ownership and the taxwrite-offs.   &quot;It's something to enjoy. And there are tax advantages,&quot;says Mr. Ballard. &quot;I don't see any appreciation for two orthree years.&quot;   Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic ForecastingCenter at Georgia State University in Atlanta, says anecdotalinformation suggests land prices in Gwinnett have tumbled&quot;15% to 20% in the past year&quot; and housing prices havedeclined &quot;5% to 10%&quot; in the same period. &quot;It's still falling.Nobody sees firmness yet,&quot; he adds.   &quot;We'll still see a glut developing until the end of nextyear,&quot; says Mr. Ratajczak, who predicts housing prices willstabilize in 1992 and start to rebound in 1993.   -- Martha Brannigan</TEXT></DOC>
