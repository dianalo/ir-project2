(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>TOOLS TO MANAGE CHANGE NEEDED IN CHANGING TIMESandM;The rate of change in software application architecture, especially theheightening responsibility of programmable workstations, is driving thedemand for software tools to manage change itself.andM;Observers say that tools for configuration management--which keep track ofthe components of the software system--and for change control--which keeptrack of different software versions--are becoming essential for softwaredevelopers.andP;  Trends driving this change include the following:andM;* The move to cooperative processing between workstation and host;andM;* The increasing use of client-server database architecture;andM;* Teams of developers working within local area networks;andM;* The increasing use of DB2 for production applications;andM;* and IBM's Systems Application Architecture.andM;Beyond these, software is coming under closer scrutiny by auditors.andP;  Tightersecurity measures to control access to modules are needed.andP;  The maintenancebacklog begs for controls that will avoid errors.andP;  The trend toward reusablecode mandates change control and impact analysis.andM;Finally, IBM's direction with the Systems Application Architecture (SAA),Repository, Application Development Environment (ADE) and AD/Cycle willsignificantly impact change control and configuration management.andP;  IBM willprovide change control, library management and configuration managementsoftware with its repository.andM;However the open architecture that IBM is providing will allow other vendorsto offer these kinds of tools.andP;  Whether existing library management toolswill operate in the repository environment is still unclear.andM;&quot;The transition of software development and maintenance to PCs andworkstations will require changes in our approach to change control andconfiguration management,&quot; said Barbara Bouldin, author of Agents of Change,Managing the Introduction of Automated Tools, (published by Yourdon Press,division of Prentice-Hall, 1989).andM;A software configuration management organization usually divides itsresponsibilities into three areas, according to Philip Newcomb of the BoeingAdvanced Technology Center for the Computer Sciences, Seattle.andP;  He outlineshis reasoning in a paper titled, &quot;Knowledge-based Configuration Management.&quot;andO;It was published as part of the Case &quot;89 International Conference on SoftwareEngineering proceeding (see Figure 1).andM;First, the software development librarian is reponsible for: recording sourcecode changes; assembling/compiling source code and performing systemgeneration; storing source, object and executable code; keeping libraryactivity records; and providing backup source code copies.andM;Second, the software problem report and change tracking responsibilitiesinclude: logging software problem and discrepancy reports; coordinating allsoftware inputs to a change board; tracking interface revisions; keeping logsof changes and releases; and distributing reports on problems, changes,development status releases and milestones.andM;The third area of responsibility, release coordination, is concerned with:assigning software documentation names; logging software element names andnumbers; maintaining an identification system for computer softwareconfiguration items; releasing software code and documentation as engineeringrelease units; and issuing copies of unreleased software to organizations asneeded.andM;Newcomb says configuration mangagement theory has two fundamental components:andM;* Software product data is likely to be distributed across a multi-machine,multi-media environment.andM;* Software product data must be assembled into a form which customers anddevelopers can use.andM;He then describes how a knowledge-based configuration management scheme wouldprovide for more precise definition and control than file-based or relationalDBMS representations of software objects.andP;  Existing products representsoftware product data as files.andM;For years, installations that developed and delivered business applicationsystems on mainframes met most of their needs with library managementsoftware residing on the mainframe.andM;But many application developers have moved to PCs.andP;  In many cases, mainframelibrary management systems could still handle version control.andP;  However, PCchange control software started to appear and gain importance.andM;As programmable workstations (PWSs) grew in speed and storage, they were usedfor important production systems of their own.andP;  Both development and deliverytook place on the PC.andP;  Vendors developed library management toolsspecifically for PCs and workstations.andM;Today, it is a different mix.andP;  development takes place on PCs--or PWSs--anddelivery takes place on a combination of mainframes, minis and workstations.andO;This complicates configuration management, and raises many issues of control.andM;COOPERATIVE CONTROLandM;&quot;Cooperative control will be important,&quot; said Bouldin, who is alsothird-party relations manager for Micro Focus in Palo Alto, Calif.andP;  &quot;Peoplewho have been developing in PC environments have become used to having agreat deal of freedom.&quot;andM;It is important not to alienate them or impact their productivity by forcingcontrols upon them, she said.andM;With cooperative processing, different environments work together toaccomplish the objectives of an application--each performing the function itdoes best.andP;  PWSs might handle the end-user interface and some editing, whilea larger piece of hardware houses data storage.andM;&quot;No longer do people view it as a host versus PWS battle,&quot; said John Treacy,product manager for programmable workstation products at Pansophic in Lisle,Ill., &quot;but as a matter of letting each environment do what it's good at.andP;  Thedevelopment tools on the PWS are becoming very powerful.andP;  Now,&quot; heemphasized, &quot;it's a matter of optimum resource utilization.&quot;andM;Initially, processing related to data storage might be handled on a mini andlater, as the system grows, moved to a larger unit.andM;&quot;You could envision,&quot; said Lawrence Catchpole, senior consulting systemsengineer with Management Science America (MSA) in Atlanta, &quot;having a fixedassets system with the data stored on an OS2 server to start with because thecompany does not have a lot of fixed assets.&quot;andP;  As the company grows and fixedassets increase, the data may need to move to an AS/400 or a mainframe.andM;With cooperative processing, software is expected to move among platforms.andO;As the mix of environments and platforms becomes more complex, so will thenumber, type and location of software modules in a system.andP;  That involvesboth change control and configuration management.andM;Pansophic has long been known for its mainframe library managment product,Panvalet.andP;  Along with Panvalet, Librarian from Computer AssociatesInternational, Garden City, N.Y., and Endevor from Legent, Vienna, Va., arethe leading change control packages on IBM mainframes.andM;Each of these vendors is pursuing a strategy to keep up with the changingenvironment.andM;According to Treacy, it is critically important to have the necessary toolsfor each environment.andP;  &quot;the devlopment tools,&quot; he said, &quot;and the developmentplatform are becoming very powerful--especially with the advent of OS/2, the386 chip,&quot; and powerful workstation development tools.andM;&quot;Application developers are not only able to do serious editing on the PWS,but also compiling and unit testing and, in some cases, system testing,&quot; saidTreacy.andM;While the development tools are increasingly powerful, the control andconfiguration management tools have lagged.andM;According to treacy, the variety of mainframe library control products,security packages and other tools does not exist on the LAN or in astandalone PWS environment.andP;  More tools providing audit trail information,manageability, source code integrity and configuration management are neededwithin the cooperative arena, he said.andM;&quot;MIS managers are in a dilemma.andP;  They need to go to these new platforms, butthe tools aren't there to adequately control, monitor or manage thisenvironment,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;That's where we hope a tool like PAN/LCM will help.&quot;andM;PAN/LCM is Pansophic's Life Cycle Manager.andP;  &quot;We're finding that people wantto shift as much processing from the mainframe to PWSs as possible,&quot; saidPhil Leamon, a Pansophic systems consultant in Irving, Texas.andP;  (LCM wasacquired from Seidl Computer Engineering of Ann Arbor, Mich.)andM;&quot;When you move all those applications down to the PWS, LCM will give you allthe audit trails, the controls, the impact analysis and similar typecapabilities that you would expect to have in the mainframe environment,&quot; hemaintained.andM;Legent is offering a workstation companion for Endevor called endevor/PC.andO;&quot;Endevor/PC works on a local area network,&quot; said Chuck Riegel, vicepresident, product marketing for the Business Software Technology (BST)division of Legent.andP;  &quot;A link to mainframe Endevor will be available in June.&quot;andO;A Windows version of the product will precede release of the mainframe link,he said.andM;BST, based in Westborough, Mass., was recently purchased by Legent.andP;  MarioMorino, chairman of Legent, said his firm's interest was strengthened byBST's &quot;proven&quot; working relationship with IBM, and trends toward cooperativeor &quot;enterprise-wide&quot; computing.andM;&quot;We see IS as the enterprise system integrator.andP;  We want to give ourcustomers tools to build and integrate cooperative processing into theirenvironments,&quot; Morino said.andM;BST recently announced the availability of Endevor/CSP, said to be the firstautomated software management tool for IBM's Cross System Product applicationgenerator.andM;The product will answer concerns of MIS professionals about using CSP toproduce production applications accessing DB2, according to Riegel.andM;The tool is said to provide version control and recovery of prior releases,which eliminates error-prone manual operations previously required with CSPapplications, he said.andM;&quot;People have been building CSP applications, but the inability to manage thelibraries has made them hesitant to put the applications into a productionenvironment,&quot; Riegel said.andM;Computer Associates' entry into the PC arena is Adlib.andP;  &quot;Essentially, Adlibis a PC extension of Librarian,&quot; said Michael Anthony, marketing manager withCAI.andP;  &quot;But it's not just a library management system.andP;  It also provides PCeditor services, and it works well in a local area network.&quot;andM;Many features have been added to mainframe Librarian--originally marketed byapplied Data Research--to keep up with user demand.andM;&quot;Change management and EDP auditing,&quot; said Joe DiMarcantonio, product ownerfor Librarian, &quot;have grown significantly in many installations.andP;  Auditingfirms routinely inspect clients' MIS departments to ensure that criticalbusiness software systems are sound and secure.andM;&quot;Release 3.9 of Librarian, currently in beta test,&quot; said DiMarcantonio,&quot;provides a generalized security interface for CA-Top Secret, CA-ACF2 andRACF that can replace or complement CA-Librarian's software lock facility.&quot;andM;Another new feature involves DB2 support through the CA-Librarian ChangeControl Facility (LIB/CCF), which controls the precompile and &quot;bind&quot;processes and manages the DBRM library.andM;(When DB2 programs are compiled, SQL statements are essentially convertedinto database request modules, DBRMs, which are stored in a separate library.andO;When the program is link-edited into a load module, the DBRM goes through a&quot;bind&quot; process which generates a &quot;plan.&quot;andP;  That plan is the optimized SQLexecution code path, stored internal to DB2.andP;  So the bind is the link betweenthe DBRM and the optimized execution path.)andM;&quot;We provide many of the key features of mainframe Librarian on the PC withAdlib,&quot; said Anthony.andP;  &quot;It basically provides cooperative processing betweenthe mainframe and PC.andM;&quot;The key is we let the programmer select the best environment for theirwork,&quot; said Anthony.andP;  &quot;We allow you to upload and download portions ofprograms rather than the entire program.andP;  We maintain the audit trail forpieces which have actually changed.&quot;andM;Configuration management has long been important in defense, space-related,engineering and scientific work.andP;  The Department of Defense (DOD) mandatescertain configuration management procedures.andM;SPACE PROGRAM BOOSTED TOOL USEandM;&quot;It was during the Apollo moon program that NASA set up very comprehensiveconfiguration management requirements,&quot; said Tom Miller, a configurationmanagement manager at Perkin-Elmer in Danbury, Conn.andP;  It was such a largeprogram and had so many people working on it that control was essential.andM;&quot;Many of today's Air Force and DOD configuration management requirements dateback to the Apollo program,&quot; Miller said.andM;&quot;When the number of people working on a program starts to get large, youcan't do control by saying, 'Hey, Joe, I got this file out,'&quot; said MikeBallentine, senior product marketing manager with Hewlett-Packard in PaloAlto, Calif.andP;  &quot;And when you get applications that are bigger than a fewhundred thousand lines of code, control is critical.&quot;andM;Many of these applications execute on powerful workstations and minicomputerswith DEC VMS, Unix or IBM's AIX operating systems.andP;  Unix users have severalchange control packages which are either bundled together with the Unixsystem or available for a nominal charge.andM;Source Code Control System (SCCS) is included in ATandamp;T's distribution of Unixas part of the programmer's workbench.andP;  It is also available from othervendors.andP;  Revision Control System (RCS) is available for a nominal chargefrom the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge, Mass., which has nocommitment to support the product.andP;  It is also available from HP.andP;  Both SCCSand RCS run under all variants of Unix, but are used primarily in Berkeleyversions.andM;Susan Dart, member of the technical staff of the Software EngineeringInstitute of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said that a number ofsmaller installations that cannot afford configuration management softwarebenefit from tools like SCCS and RCS.andM;Both products provide basically simple version control capabilities.andP;  Forsmaller installations these &quot;free&quot; packages may be adequate, though it cantake expensive programming resources to write the shell scripts (macro-typestructures) to support these products.andM;Installations with larger systems turn to products such as the DomainSoftware Engineering Environment (DSEE) from the Apollo Division ofHewlett-Packard, the Polytron Version Control System (PVCS) from Sage ofRockville, Md., Teamwork from Cadre in Providence, R.I., Digital's CodeManagement System (CMS), or products from Software Maintenance andDevelopment Systems Inc. in Concord, Mass., or Softool in Goleta, Calif.andM;Some companies, like Perkin-Elmer, have in-house configuration managementsystems.andP;  &quot;We established our configuration management long before adequatesoftware was available in the marketplace,&quot; explained Miller.andP;  The nature oftheir systems required that they start developing extensive configurationmanagement software back in the 1960s.andM;&quot;We just used our comprehensive configuration management program on theHubble Space Telescope project,&quot; added Miller.andM;&quot;On large scientific and engineering projects,&quot; said Ballentine, &quot;justcompiling them can be a significant problem.andP;  We've seen compiles that take aweek.andP;  Even on a 3090-class machine, some of these compiles can run 50hours.&quot;andM;DSEE (affectionately nicknamed &quot;Dizzy&quot;) uses parallel compiles on a networkto speed up the process.andP;  &quot;One node on the network says, 'OK, let's startthis build,'&quot; explained Ballentine.andP;  &quot;Then it looks around the network formachines that are available to do parallel compiles.andP;  When the process firstcame out, marketing tagged it with the slogan, 'From over night to overlunch.'&quot;andM;Cadre uses DSEE for builds which are a collection of compiles.andP;  Cadre'ssoftware, Teamwork, is used in the development life cycle before coding takesplace.andM;&quot;Teamwork is a Case product, and is typically used before you write code,&quot;said Thor Johnson, Cadre's director of marketing.andP;  &quot;The things that youproduce using our product are different from code and require their ownflavor of configuration management.andP;  Our configuration management productlives inside of Teamwork and it cooperates with other vendors' sourcemanagement systems.&quot;andM;Johnson agrees that cooperative processing will make configuration managementmore important in the business community.andM;&quot;Anytime you're dealing with complexity,&quot; added Johnson, &quot;either inbroadness, which you'll have in cooperative processing, or in time, where youhave to go back and reconstruct previous versions, you need a goodconfiguration management system.&quot;andM;Sage is active in both the Unix and the IBM mainframe markets in providingCase as well as configuration management tools.andP;  In 1984, Sage introduced theAPS Application Generator.andP;  Last year Sage acquired Polytron Corp. and nowmarkets the Polytron Version Control System.andM;(See profile in this issue for more information on Sage.)andM;&quot;Vendors have wrestled with where to put configuration management,&quot; said theSoftware Engineering Institute's Dart.andP;  &quot;They have wondered if they shouldput it in their Case tool or have their customers buy a generic one, lettingthe Case vendors perform the integration.&quot;andM;That is a timely question in view of IBM's endorsement of Case with AD/Cycle.andO;Increased Case capabilities, automatic code generators, artificialintelligence and internetworking will impact change control and configurationmanagement.andP;  IBM's support will give Case a big boost, but some vendors whochoose not to be consistent with the IBM direction risk diminishing themarketability of their products.andP;  And to the extent the IBM applicationdevelopment information model differs from that of installed applications,users' software investment may not be preserved.andM;On the other hand, IBM's endorsement of Case and new &quot;partnership&quot; softwaredevelopment agreements with many software companies have the potential toraise software development and maintenance productivity.andP;  There is alsoapplause for the open architecture that IBM seems to be developing in theapplication development area.andM;Many software vendors are already planning for the dramatic changes.andM;&quot;We've made a big commitment to redevelop our product line to be compliantwith SAA,&quot; explained MSA's Catchpole.andP;  While MSA saw the importance ofconfiguration management several years ago, it believes that recent changesspurred by SAA, Case and code generators put far more importance on thiscapability than ever before.andM;&quot;Three years ago, we performed an evaluation of configuration managementproducts,&quot; said Catchpole.andP;  &quot;Obviously, we had a choice of developing itourselves or purchasing it.andP;  However, we felt that our expertise was inapplication development, not in tool development.andM;&quot;We chose BST's Endevor,&quot; said Catchpole.andP;  &quot;We liked the direction that theproduct was going.&quot;andM;It is important to MSA that their configuration management capabilities beable to meet the challenges of the changing environment they are facing withcooperative processing and adherence to IBM's direction.andM;&quot;We are implementing Endevor in our product line,&quot; said Catchpole.andP;  &quot;Rightnow we are using it primarily as a source management tool rather than as aconfiguration management tool.andP;  But when we redevelop our products for SAAand cooperative processing, BST's Endevor will be even more important to ourdevelopment environment.&quot;andM;MSA frequently sends out tapes of software to its clients.andP;  Version controlis critical.andM;&quot;We're using Endevor today to store our source, or what you'd traditionallycall source: Cobol copy books,&quot; explained Catchpole.andP;  &quot;We're using afootprinting feature within Endevor to ensure that when we cut a tape, theobject on the tape matches the source that we have certified.&quot;andM;Footprinting is a technique used to link an executable module to the sourcecode that created it.andP;  Since Endevor controls the changes to both source andexecutable, it automatically stamps the executable with source identificationinformation.andM;&quot;We just brought in Endevor/PC for an evaluation and we like it,&quot; saidCatchpole.andP;  &quot;So as we build our SAA-based cooperative processing systems,we're going to expand our concept of what is 'source' to go beyond programsource modules.andP;  'Source' will include things like detailed designspecifications.&quot;andM;With the increasing use of code generators, this is an important point.andP;  Whencode is automatically generated from design specifications, modifications tothe end program will be specified by changing the design specificationsrather than directly altering source code programs.andP;  This means developerscan track the changes to the design specifications.andM;&quot;Source will include all deliverable-type information,&quot; Catchpole said.andP;  &quot;Thenew concept of source will involve any information that needs to be managedand kept that is pertinent to the product development life cycle.&quot;andM;SOURCE MUST BE ACCESSIBLEandM;If all these types of entities or objects are going to be considered as&quot;source,&quot; they will each have to be stored in a way that makes them easilyaccessible and controllable.andM;They could, for example, be stored--or accessible by--something very muchlike IBM's Repository or application development platform.andP;  Vendors will haveto understand IBM's direction if they want to tie their change controlsoftware to IBM.andM;To date, not all vendors are clear on IBM's strategy for handling changecontrol, version management and configuration management within theRepository.andM;According to IBM literature, &quot;AD/Cycle will support maintenance by allowingdesigners and developers to use the information in the repository to performimpact analysis, and then use the same tools used for a new application toapply changes to existing application components, typically creating newversions or modification levels.andP;  The version support in AD/Cycle will assistin this activity.&quot;andM;According to Michael Mandato, marketing support representative with IBM inCarey, N.C., IBM will offer configuration management services through therepository using its Software Configuration Library Manager (SCLM),introduced last June.andM;IBM will also permit other vendors to provide configuration managementcapabilities through tool services provided by the repository.andM;&quot;Object-oriented techniques will be involved,&quot; said Mandato.andM;In the repository, objects are collections of information and the operationsassociated with them.andP;  Object data can be collections of information such assource code files, object code files and load modules.andP;  Methods are definedas reusable functions that are performed against objects.andM;&quot;When you get into the repository world, everything will be keyed off ofobjects,&quot; explained Mandato.andP;  &quot;So there will be methods that will act uponthe objects.andM;&quot;Say I have Cobol source,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;To edit Cobol source, I need a Coboleditor.andP;  The method will be 'edit.'andP;  The object will be Cobol source.andP;  Andthe method implementation will be the specific editor that you edit with--aCobol language-sensitive editor.&quot;andM;SCLM handles objects as &quot;types&quot; in partitioned data sets.andP;  Facilities fortransitioning to repository objects are all set up in SCLM, said Mandato.andM;Other examples of methods include traditional library functions such aspromote (changing the process status of an application component) and commonobject data operations such as create, copy, delete and store.andM;All these methods will use repository services to manipulate object datastored in entity-relationship format.andP;  It is clear that a lot of thought willhave to go into revising current library service and change control softwareproducts before they can truly integrate with IBM's new direction.andM;Bochenski is a high-tech freelance writer and DP professional who lives inBellevue, Wash.andP;
