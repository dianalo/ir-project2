(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>SYBASE FROM Sybase, Incorporated, is a hot contender these days in therelational database management system (RDBMS) market.andP;  Designed specificallyto meet the needs of online transaction processing applications, Sybase hashit a nerve in the industry and caused a lot of people to sit up and takenotice.andM;We still remember our first encounter with Sybase when it was announced twoyears ago.andP;  Robert Epstein, Sybase's executive vice president, forcefullydeclared that the database was &quot;no longer just a spineless filing cabinet, awimp&quot;  meekly accepting whatever data was thrown its way.andP;  Sybase enabled thedatabase to stand up and say, &quot;No.andP;  You can't do that.&quot; The objective was toeffectively enforce an organization's business rules while providing highperformance, round-the-clock availability, and dramatic improvements indeveloper productivity.andP;  The image stuck, and we were impressed with both thedesign of the product and the appeal of the company's marketing strategy.andM;Although the competition initially downplayed Sybase's potential impact onthe market, saying that the company started too late, etc., the evidence isclear: There was pent-up demand for what Sybase had to offer.andP;  Take a look atthe financial indicators.andP;  Company revenues have grown at a phenomenal ratesince Sybase was commercially introduced.andP;  Although Sybase is privately heldand does not report financial results, estimates from a reliable source looklike this: Revenues of $6 million in fiscal year 1987,$24 million in 1988,and projections of $55 million plus in 1989.andP;  This means annual revenueincreases of 300 percent and 129 percent respectively.andP;  While this iscertainly a growing market, Sybase is still considered a relatively new kidon the block, competing with established RDBMS vendors such as Oracle,Relational Technology, and Informix Software.andM;In this issue, we take an in-depth look at the Sybase architecture andprovide some user and developer perspective as well.andP;  SOME BACKGROUND.andP;  Priorto starting Sybase in 1984 with venture capital backing, the company'sfounders had been involved in the development and marketing of severalleading relational products, including the Ingres research project at theUniversity of California at Berkeley, IBM's DB2, and Britton Lee's IDM.andP;  Theob- jective for the Sybase effort was to address the shortcomings of existingRDBMS products for handling online applications.andM;The primary issue was to design a relational database that would provide morethan just a decision support sys- tem.andP;  The underlying problems fell intothree critical areas: performance, availability, and database integrity.andM;The architecture of traditional RDBMSs simply was not adequate for onlineapplications, those mission-critical, transaction-oriented systems supportingmany concurrent users and often accessing very large databases.andP;  RDBMSs weregenerally single-threaded products that accessed the database usinginterpretive rather than compiled syntax.andP;  It was also necessary to bring theentire system down in order to backup or modify the database.andP;  All of thishampered performance.andM;In terms of integrity, the traditional RDBMS was, in fact, a spineless filingcabinet.andP;  It handled the storage and retrieval of data, but filtering orevaluation to assess data validity was left to the front-end application.andO;This can create problems in a networked environment, a characteristic of manyonline applications.andM;The company did its homework well and accurately assessed some importantindustry trends.andP;  As a result, Sybase is designed for both online anddecision-support applications.andP;  It is relational, SQL-based, and designedfrom the start as a client/ server DBMS.andP;  The server, called the SQL Server,is multithreaded and provides integrated support for both networking anddistributed databases.andP;  The server is also intelligent, enforcing integrityconstraints from within the database itself.andP;  As Bob Epstein stated recently,Networking has been around a long time.andP;  But a meaningful client/serverarchitecture requires intelligence in the server itself.andP;  This is thedifference between having a server and having a mere database on thenetwork.&quot;andM;Sybase employs over 350 people (double the number from last year) and has 18U.S.andP;  sales offices.andP;  International operations include both wholly ownedsubsidiaries (Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Australia) anddistributors.andP;  PRODUCT HISTORY.andP;  Sybase originally ran on only threeplatforms: DEC VAX/VMS, Sun/Unix workstations, and Pyramid 98x/Unix.andO;Recognizing that it could not be all things to all people, Sybase took asharply focused approach to operating platforms, particularly for the SQLServer.andM;Sybase currently runs on five server platforms and six front-end platforms, with more to come.andP;  The company has no immediate plans in the IBM MVS/DB2environ- ment other than gateways.andP;  It will continue to add Unix platformsvery carefully, ensuring that it covers a broad price/performance range aswell as platforms that are important internationally.andP;  Thus, the company iskeeping a close eye on its ports and will move ahead as business conditionsdictate.andM;The company acknowledges two things here: strong pressure from customers toport to additional systems, and the truth in Oracle's contention  thatportability across multiple platforms really does matter.andP;  We expect to seeSybase on many more platforms over the next couple of years.andM;Another initial negative for Sybase was the lack of applications developmenttools.andP;  As Epstein says, &quot;Our image has been one of a server and not a toolscompany.&quot; This, too, has been remedied with the recent introduction of APTWorkbench.andM;The next version of Sybase is in beta test and will be released shortly.andP;  Wediscuss the coming attractions more fully under &quot;Future Directions&quot; below.andO;MARKETING STRATEGY.andP;  The company markets to corporate and government endusers, OEMS, and VARs.andP;  Its two strongest target industries are financialservices and government/aerospace.andP;  Right behind aremanufacturing/distribution and telecommunications.andP;  These four marketscomprise about 80 percent of Sybase's business.andP;  Other up-and-coming segmentsinclude medical/health care, electronic publishing/information services, andtransportation.andM;Sybase has an OEM agreement with Stratus Computer and joint marketingagreements with other platform vendors.andP;  ne number of VARs working withSybase is more than 25 and growing.andM;Since controlled shipments began in October, 1986, Sybase has over 400customers and over 500 sites worldwide.andP;  The company expects to add 600 newcustomer sites this fiscal year, bringing its sites to over 1,000.andP;  SoftwarePartners.andP;  Sybase has also put much effort into developing a successfulsoftware partners program.andP;  These partners provide a wide variety ofadditional tools that can access the Sybase SQL Server.andP;  Sybase views workingwith these independent vendors as important for two reasons.andP;  Again, Sybaserecognizes that it cannot provide all things to all customers (StewartSchuster, vice president of marketing, calls this the company's &quot;religion&quot;).andO;In addition, software partners expand the Sybase environment, allowing theSybase server to run with other front-end tools as well as providingpotential links with other databases.andM;Sybase is no longer just a database engine company.andP;  It is investing as mucheffort in its tools as in its server.andP;  The company is willing to share thetools business with its partners, but is not willing to share the serverbusiness without a fight (except with IBM and DB2).andP;  OS/2.andP;  Early in 1988,Sybase jointly announced, with Microsoft and Ashton-Tate, the Sybase SQLServer on OS/2.andP;  SQL Server will be marketed by all three companies when it available shortly (network developer kits have already been distributed).andM;SQL Server will provide a database foundation in the OS/2 environment fordistributed services and data management This is essential for the trueimplementation of distributed network computing on the PC LAN platform.andO;Developers and users alike are drooling over this opportunity.andP;  NeXT.andO;Another interesting marketing approach is the agreement with Steve Jobs'sNEXT, Incorporated, to bundle the Sybase SQL Server with every NeXT computersystem.andP;  NeXT's marketing agreement with Businessland provides a potentialretail outlet for Sybase.andP;  Architecture Sybase is optimized to run on anetwork of servers and workstations.andP;  Its client/server architecture splitsthe DBMS into a front end (the SQL Toolset) and a back end (the SQL Server).andO;The server handles data management functions for all users on the system.andO;The SQL Toolset provides the user interface and a set of window-based toolsfor building and running applications.andP;  The two components can runconcurrently on a single computer or independently on different machines.andO;Moving from a single machine to a network does not require rewritingapplications or retraining users (Sybase uses network communications betweenthe server and front end even when both are on the same machine), andapplications run interchangeably on character terminals and bit-mappedworkstations.andP;  SQL SERVER.andP;  One of the unique aspects of Sybase is the factthat the SQL Server runs as a single program.andP;  Sybase is essentially a&quot;database operating system&quot; on top of, and independent of, the underlyingoperating system.andP;  Eliminating most operating system overhead accounts for alarge measure of the increased performance Sybase provides.andP;  Sybase itselfcontrols and optimizes such multiuser functions as opening and closing files,scheduling concurrent users against a database, task-switching, disk-caching,indexing, transaction processing, and locking.andP;  Sybase only uses theoperating system to physically drive the disks and manage the network.andP;  Amere 33K of memory per user is required to manage this single SQL Serverprocess (e.g., Sybase can handle 30 users with IMB of memory).andM;Sybase is also multithreaded.andP;  It can optimize and process several SQLstatements at the same time, including transaction locking and input/output.andO;BUILT-IN DATA INTEGRITY.andP;  A key feature of Sybase is the ability to defineand store all data integrity rules, including referential integrity, asprocedures in the data dictionary.andP;  Integrity is enforced centrally in theSQL Server, rather than in each application program, and no application oruser can circumvent the rules.andP;  Developers can prototype and writeapplications with less code, and changes to integrity rules only need to bemade in one place.andP;  The database administrator is no longer dependent on theapplications development staff to maintain data integrity.andM;This issue is particularly important in a networked environment.andP;  Here, it ismuch more difficult to control what version of a program runs on aworkstation, or to ensure that every developer understands the rules forprotecting the database from corruption and inconsistencies.andP;  HIGHAVAILABILITY.andP;  Unlike other relational databases, Sybase allows all backups,recovery, database design changes, and other system maintenance to beperformed while applications are running.andP;  This is a requirement for manyonline systems.andM;On some platforms, Sybase also provides software-based fault toleranceenforced through the RDBMS itself, rather than through the operating system.andO;Copies of the database and transaction log are maintained on two differentdisks.andP;  Sybase can also mirror a single database rather than the contents ofan entire disk, which most other mirroring systems require.andP;  This providesoptimum use of disk space.andP;  DISTRIBUTED DATABASES.andP;  Most RDBMS vendors aredeveloping distributed database capabilities, and have initially implementedthe ability to retrieve data from multiple databases on multiple machines ina single query.andP;  Sybase also provides the ability to update multipledatabases in a single transaction through a &quot;two-phase commit&quot; protocol.andO;This ensures that all updates at multiple locations have been completedbefore committing the entire transaction.andP;  If failures or errors occur, theeffects of partially completed transactions will  be automatically backedout, leaving the databases in a consistent state.andP;  DATABASE OBJECTS.andP;  WhileSybase is not an object-oriented database, it implements some of the conceptsof the object-oriented model.andP;  Objects in Sybase, for example, can have bothproperties and processing associated with them.andP;  Properties and processingcan be inherited in some cases.andP;  Database objects (databases, tables, views,indexes, data types, defaults, rules, triggers, and stored procedures) arephysically stored in the database as part of the data dictionary.andP;  Reportsare also stored in the database as stored procedures.andP;  However, forms arestored externally in operating system files.andP;  It would certainly make sense,from the perspective of increased consistency and control, to incorporateforms as database objects in the future.andP;  The company plans to do this.andO;Transact-SQL.andP;  Transact-SQL, the Sybase version of SQL, is the language usedto create and manipulate database objects.andP;  It includes ANSI-standard SQLstatements and extensions to SQL, such as commands to create user-defineddata types, rules, defaults, triggers, and stored procedures; control-of-flowlanguage for if/then, do while, go to, and the ability to define localvariables; and other functions not found in SQL.andP;  Stored Procedures.andP;  Theability to create a stored procedure is one of the most important andpowerful constructs in Sybase.andP;  Stored procedures are written in Transact-SQLand combine SQL statements with flow-control language.andM;Stored procedures provide many benefits and are a key to Sybase'sperformance.andP;  Stored procedures are precompiled, minimizing execution timeover SQL statements (either alone or in batches) submitted by the front-endapplication and interpreted each time by the server.andP;  The first time a storedprocedure is run, the server prepares an execution plan and stores this inthe database.andP;  Subsequently, the procedure is executed according to thestored plan.andP;  The most commonly used stored procedures are also cached inmemory in a procedure buffer, eliminating disk I/O.andM;Because stored procedures are part of the database, they reduce networktraffic, which also improves performance.andP;  A single &quot;execute storedprocedure&quot; statement can be submitted to the server from the front-endapplication, yet the stored procedure can contain multiple SQL statements.andO;In addition, a single stored procedure can be used by multiple applications.andO;This reduces application development time and eases maintenance since astored procedure is modified in one place.andM;Stored procedures also provide extensive flexibility.andP;  ne developer candefine parameters to be supplied at run-time when the stored procedure isexecuted.andP;  A stored procedure can return to the calling program bothparameters and status codes to identify the success or failure of itsexecution (and the reason for failure).andP;  Stored procedures can call otherprocedures.andP;  They can also be executed on remote SQL Servers.andP;  For example,you could write triggers on a local SQL Server that execute procedures on aremote server whenever certain events take place locally.andP;  System Procedures.andO;Sybase provides an extensive set of predefined stored procedures, calledsystem procedures, that can be used for a variety of functions (e.g., addingusers and logins, binding rules and defaults to columns, and defining userdata types).andP;  Triggers.andP;  A trigger is a special kind of stored procedureoften used to protect referential (cross-table) integrity.andP;  Triggers can beused to cascade changes through related tables in the database (e.g., makingsure primary and foreign keys are consistent), and to disallow changes thatwould violate referential integrity (e.g., deleting a customer master recordif the customer has orders outstanding).andM;Each table can have one trigger associated with each data manipulationstatement: insert, update, and delete.andP;  Triggers can also be used beyond justreferential integrity to update summary data, perform more complex fieldvalidation than that permitted in rules, and other functions.andM;Triggers can call local or remote stored procedures, can cause other triggersto execute if maintenance operations are performed on other tables (althougha trigger cannot cause itself to fire recursively), and can be nested 16deep.andM;Sybase is considering adding in the future the ability to define a triggerthat fires when a Select statement is executed.andP;  In a distributedenvironment, for example, a Select trigger could be used to retrieveup-to-date data dictionary information necessary to optimize a distributedquery.andP;  You could also use a Select trigger to generate audit trails,identifying who is accessing data or writing certain kinds of queries.andO;Rules.andP;  Rules are used to validate data entered in a field.andP;  You first createthe rule using a Transact-SQL statement, and then bind the rule to a columnin a table.andP;  Rules are applied any time data is inserted or updated in thetable.andP;  Rules are limited to defining a set of values for a field entry, andcannot reference other column values or information in other databaseobjects.andP;  Therefore, rules cannot be used to do cross-table field validation(this is done instead with triggers).andP;  A rule can be bound to multiplecolumns, but each column can only have one rule.andP;  Defaults.andP;  Defaults areused to ensure that a value is supplied for every column requiring one.andP;  Adefault is only applied on insert, and then only if the field is left blank.andO;It provides protection against a user or an application failing to enter avalue in a field defined as &quot;not null.&quot; A default can be linked to a specificfield or to a data type.andP;  When linked to a data type, any field defined withthat data type inherits the default.andP;  Defining a default is very similar todefining a rule.andP;  SQL TOOLSET.andP;  The Sybase SQL Toolset is the front-endclient software, and it includes the Data Workbench, APT Workbench, andDB-Library.andP;  For those who are wondering, APT stands for &quot;applicationproductivity tools.&quot;) The Data Workbench and APT Workbench are visuallyoriented tools for decision support and applications development.andP;  They use avisual  point and pick&quot; style of interface with overlapping windows andpull-down menus.andP;  Data Workbench.andP;  The Data Workbench is designed toaccommodate all levels of users-developer, administrator, and end user.andP;  Itincludes facilities for creating tables, queries, and reports, and for doingsome data entry.andP;  Queries can be generated using the SQL editor or apoint-and-pick Visual Query Language (VQL).andP;  VQL allows the user to composeand run SQL queries without any knowledge of SQL syntax (we like that-no enduser really wants to write SQL queries).andP;  The Data Workbench also includesdatabase administration utilities and a clipboard function to transferqueries among tools.andM;The Data Workbench is used by developers as an interface for developing,testing, and debugging Transact-SQL statements, and for creating storedprocedures, rules, triggers, etc.andP;  These can then be incorporated intoapplications designed with APT Workbench.andP;  APT Workbench.andP;  AFT Workbench is anew component that extends APT-Edit, the original Sybase module for designingforms, into a full-fledged applications development environment APT Workbenchadds a 4GL applications development language  APT-SQL) and an applicationsgenerator  APTBuild).andP;  Previously, Sybase developers could design forms withAPT-Edit, but the rest of the application had to be written in a 3GL.andP;  Thislack of a 4GL was hurting Sybase competitively.andP;  Announced in late 1988, thisproduct has just started shipping for Sun and Digital's VMS.andP;  Other platformswill follow.andM;Sybase's tools are primarily targeted at the applications developer, not theend user.andP;  According to Bob Epstein, database end-user development toolsshould and will be offered by vendors such as Microsoft and Lotus, since theuser may want to view the database in a spreadsheet or some other familiarformat.andP;  APT-SQL.andP;  Like Transact-SQL, APT-SQL also deals with objects, butthey are application objects such as forms and menus rather than databaseobjects.andP;  Both languages are similar in construction and syntax.andP;  It is notso much that they are different languages, but that they are designed aridoptimized to do different things.andP;  Another way to think about it is toassociate APT-SQL with the context around the database for a particularapplication, and Transact-SQL with the actual content of the database.andM;Like stored procedures, APT-SQL procedures are also precompiled, but they arestored on the front end.andP;  Eventually, the company plans to store APTprocedures in the data dictionary as well.andP;  This would make the managementand tracking of APT procedures much easier.andP;  DB-Library.andP;  DB-Library consistsof a host language interface for C, Cobol, Pascal, Fortran, and Ada, andnetworking support for DECnet, TCP/IP, and LAN Manager.andP;  APT-Library.andP;  LikeDB-Library, APT-Library is a call-level interface allowing 3GL programs toaccess APT-SQL procedures and forms.andP;  FUTURE DIRECTIONS.andP;  Version 4.0 of theSybase SQL Server, soon to be announced, will introduce a number of majorenhancements to the product.andP;  The bottom line is to further implement theSybase goal of an open, adaptable client/server architecture.andO;Server-To-Server Communications.andP;  Version 4.0 will extend the Sybasenetworking to communications between servers where servers can act as clientsto other servers.andP;  This server-to-server remote procedure call (RPC) willprovide more transparency for the user than the current system.andP;  Currently,the client must be logged on to a remote SQL Server in order to access dataand stored procedures there (stored procedures always reside with the datathey access), and must include the name of the remote server in the command.andO;Now the local SQL Server will take care of the communications with the remoteserver.andP;  Open Server Technology.andP;  Sybase will be providing a toolkit toenable developers to build their own servers, or gateways, to both dataservices and applications services.andP;  According to Bob Epstein, having an opensystem means &quot;supplying enough technology to your competitors so they canimplement your system.&quot; Sybase will provide both specs and library routinesfor its Open Server.andP;  The Sybase Open Server will be marketed as opensoftware, licensing both source and object code, and allowing third partiesto resell these licenses.andP;  The company also plans to offer open access toDB-Lirary, enabling users to tailor the front end as well.andM;This strategy is fundamentally different from that undertaken by competitorssuch as Relational Technology.andP;  The customer/developer will be able tointegrate Sybase with other databases and with non-SQL systems, such aselectronic mail, and not have to wait for Sybase itself to develop theintegration.andP;  The Open Server is the foundation on which Sybase will buildits own gateways in the future.andP;  New Functions and Data Types.andP;  New text andimage data types will be added, as well as many new mathematical and stringfunctions.andP;  PRESENTATION INDEPENDENCE.andP;  Sybase has been working on developingindependence at the presentation level for the past 18 months.andP;  This facilitywill debut later this year as the Adaptable Windowing Environment (AWE).andP;  ASybase application run on a particular platform will automatically emulatethe look and feel of the interface native to that platform.andP;  MULTIPROCESSORS.andO;By the end of this year, Sybase win introduce the ability to take advantageof all processors in an SM? (symmetric  multiprocessor) architecture.andP;  Thiscapability is already written and demonstrable, and it will be attractive forcustomers with very large, high-performance applications.andP;  THE END USER'SPERSPECTIVE We reviewed a beta version of Sybase Release 4.0 running on a Sun3/60 workstation under Unix.andP;  User Interface Sybase provides a consistent,menu-driven user interface, displaying on most screens a set of standardicons for scrolling, exit, tools, and  help.andM;The Tools menu provides access to the data dictionary, a history listing (thelast 20 SQL statements executed during the current session), the clipboard,and options for customizing the Data Workbench.andP;  We found the data dictionarybrowser very helpful.andP;  NAVIGATION.andP;  It is very easy to move around in Sybaseusing the mouse on the Sun workstation.andP;  Navigating with the keyboard is alittle trickier.andP;  Keyboard users move through menu options (and the &quot;tools&quot;icon) in a circular fashion with the left and right arrow keys.andP;  The Help andExit options are accessed with function keys.andM;On the keyboard, the up and down arrow keys don't work in the familiar way.andO;Instead of moving the cursor or scrolling information, they select theappropriate symbol in the group of scrolling icons, and the Return key ac- tually invokes the scrolling by screen.andP;  This is confusing and requires extrakeystrokes to accomplish what should be a very simple navigational task.andP;  InCommand mode, the arrow keys do operate as expected.andP;  However, Command modeonly applies for a few operations, requiring the user to turn it on again.andO;We would like the option to keep Command mode on.andM;Sybase does not currently support the use of standard function keys.andO;However, Sybase defines three permanent keys on the keyboard (Command mode,Help, and Exit) regardless of what window you are in, and onewindow-dependent soft key.andP;  We would like to see active function keysdisplayed on the screen (with an option to toggle off and on).andP;  We would alsolike the option to define more function keys (coming in a future release).andM;Sybase supports a wide variety of control key sequences, but they do notalways work where you might intuitively expect them to.andP;  After retrieving aset of records using query-by-example, we tried to browse through the recordsusing *N&quot; and &quot;^P&quot; for next/previous record.andP;  No such luck.andP;  We had to usethe menu for this, a two- (or more) step process.andM;Sybase was designed and developed on a bit-mapped workstation.andP;  It hasperhaps suffered from a fascination with the graphical and a lack ofattention to the needs of the many character-based terminal users out there.andO;HELP.andP;  Help is context sensitive, and related topics are highlighted inreverse video within the Help text The user can also get an index listing.andO;This is not an alpha list of help topics, unfortunately, but a hierarchicallist that follows the menu structure (Sybase calls this &quot;in functionalorder&quot;).andP;  To find a topic, you must browse the list if you don't know whereit fits in the menu structure.andP;  Other options are a list of control/functionkeys and printing the Help text.andM;You can only scroll Help text by screen, but the text does overlap by oneline when scrolling between screens.andP;  DOCUMENTATION.andP;  The Sybasedocumentation is excellent, and the new three-ring-binder format isattractively designed.andP;  The manuals are clearly written, with adequate whitespace and tons of examples and screen illustrations, making it easy to followthe text on the system.andP;  A refreshing sense of humor also comes through hereand there.andM;There are several manuals, but this is not particularly intimidating sinceall are clearly targeted.andP;  One thing missing in most of the manuals is tabsto identify sections for fast reference.andP;  Other potential enhancementsinclude more use of color, heavier stock paper so the reverse page doesn'tshow through, and higher quality printing.andP;  Creating a Database Sybaseprovides three system databases.andP;  The Master database keeps track of theentire Sybase installation, including all other databases, valid logins, andphysical devices.andP;  This information is stored in data dictionary tables.andP;  Inthe future, the Master database will also contain information on otherservers with which its SQL Server can communicate.andM;The Model database provides an initial template for a new database.andP;  TheTemporary database stores any temporary tables that a user or applicationcreates.andP;  CREATING TABLES.andP;  Tables are created using the standard SQL &quot;createtable&quot; command in the Data Workbench SQL editor.andP;  There is no menu-driven&quot;fill in the form&quot; way to define the fields in a table, which would be a nicefeature for the end user.andP;  Using SQL means remembering not only the correctsyntax, but also all of the options and parameters available for data types.andO;DATA TYPES.andP;  Sybase currently supports 11 different data types, includingthree types of integers, float, char and varchar (fixed- or variable-lengthcharacter field up to 255 characters), binary and varbinary (fixed- orvariable-length binary field up to 255 characters), bit (0 or 1, used fortrue/false or yes/no types of data), money, datetime, and timestamp.andM;Coming in the next version of Sybase are variable-length text and image datatypes, each able to hold up to 2 billion bytes.andP;  User Data Types.andP;  Sybasealso allows the creation of user-defined data types, which are defined interms of existing system data types.andP;  For example, you cannot define alatitude/ longitude data type composed of degrees and radians because Sybasedoesn't understand these concepts.andM;User-defined data types can be helpful for field definitions that are usedrepeatedly, such as a part number.andP;  Defining a new data type can save stepswhen creating a new table and provide consistency across multiple tablesusing the same field definition.andM;Sybase supports the concept of nulls, or unknown values, and any field can bedefined as accepting nulls or not.andP;  The default is &quot;not null.&quot; MODIFYINGTABLES.andP;  It is not possible to change the structure of a table after it isdefined except to add fields with the  alter table&quot; command.andP;  This isstandard for most of the RDBMSs we have reviewed, although some provideadditional options.andM;In Sybase, if you want to change a field's data type or length, delete afield, or change whether nulls are allowed, you must unload the data, dropthe table, redefine it, and load the data back in.andP;  Reasons for this are: thedata 1/2W relates to the physical storage of the data, deleting columns caninvalidate applications, and deleting data in a large database can requiresignificant overhead.andM;However, our frustration level is high here, since, as anyone who has evertried to design a database knows, you never get it right the first time.andP;  Andend users do not want to deal with loading and unloading data.andP;  Attractingend users as future application developers requires an easier way to modifytable structure.andP;  Sybase does ease the pain somewhat with a stored procedurefor renaming database objects, including tables and fields.andP;  DATA ENTRY.andP;  TheData Workbench has a  quick and dirty&quot; data entry facility, using a typicaldefault format  fields listed vertically in the order defined, with fieldnames as prompts).andP;  Nothing fancy.andP;  Just the basics.andP;  You can only enter datainto one table at a time.andP;  However, triggers and rules still enforce dataintegrity.andP;  You can also edit, find records with a query-by-example approach,and print records.andM;The data entry facility is primarily designed for use by developers andprototypers.andP;  For end users, custom forms and menus for entering and updatingdata can be defined with a wide range of functionality and flexibility usingAPT Workbench.andP;  INDEXING.andP;  Sybase supports B-tree indexing only.andP;  One specialflavor of a B-tree index, called a clustered index, physically stores thedata in sorted order to improve performance.andP;  A table can have one clusteredindex and up to 250 nonclustered indexes.andP;  Indexes can be defined as uniqueand can be dynamically created and dropped.andP;  QUERIES.andP;  Queries are generatedusing VQL (the point-and-pick approach) or the SQL editor (to write SQLstatements directly or recall stored queries).andP;  A third option is building acustom form with query-by-example option.andP;  VQL.andP;  The Visual Query Languagefacility is well implemented, menu driven, and easy to use.andP;  To query atable, the user selects the table name, and a list of the fields is thendisplayed in the top window on the screen.andP;  In the lower window, Sybaseautomatically creates the actual SQL syntax for the query and dynamicallyedits it as the user changes it with menu options.andP;  This is a nice touch fortraining users in SQL in a relatively painless fashion.andP;  Menu options existfor creating expressions, aggregates, and type conversions; and for definingjoins, field lists, sort orders, and group-by clauses.andM;VQL is used for simple Select statements queries cannot be nested).andP;  Itcannot be used to insert, update, or delete data, nor to save the results ofa query to another table.andP;  VQL is designed as an ad hoc query tool, not as away to create database objects.andM;When you select two or more tables for a query, Sybase can identify theappropriate join conditions if the names of the fields for the join areidentical in each table.andP;  Otherwise, you tell the system how to perform thejoin.andP;  Sybase supports an outer join.andM;You cannot save a query as constructed in VQL.andP;  You can only save the SQLequivalent.andP;  When recalling the query, you edit it using the SQL editor.andM;With VQL's extensive formatting options, it is easy to add or delete columns,change the order of the columns, and change the properties associated withboth the heading and the data in each column.andP;  This formatting is reflectedin the SQL equivalent as well.andP;  SQL.andP;  The SQL editor is accessed directlyfrom the operating system or from within Data Workbench.andP;  The menus allow youto create, run, and debug SQL statements interactively.andP;  REPORTS.andP;  Like VQL,the report writer uses a visual approach and is very easy to use.andP;  A queryprovides input for the report You can create a query within the reportwriter, using VQL or SQL, if necessary.andP;  One report can include multiplequeries.andP;  Capabilities include defining report properties, report and pageheaders/footers, control breaks, and extensive properties for each variableon the report.andM;You can specify embedded parameters in a report query, and the user will beprompted at run-time for parameter values.andP;  FORMS AND APPLICATIONS.andP;  APTWorkbench, the Sybase application development environment, is forms based andevent driven.andP;  Events include entering/exiting a field or form, selecting amenu item, etc.andP;  Each event can call another form, an APT-SQL routine, or a3GL program.andP;  Each APT Workbench object (a form, field, group of fields, ormenu option) has both properties and processing associated with it.andO;Processing is also broken down into pre- and post-processing.andM;The environment is similar to that of the Data Workbench, with menus to leadyou through the design process.andP;  It is quite easy to generate a defaultapplication.andP;  After you select the tables and fields you want on a form,APT-Build generates a default form and a default application complete withmenus.andP;  You then can customize the form and menus, adding presentationformatting and embedded processing logic.andP;  Here are a few samples of thethings you can do: * Design multitable forms using joins.andP;  * Group multiplefields (e.g., the detailandM;records on a master-detail form) andandM;operate on them as a group.andP;  * Create multilevel menus with pulldownandM;and slide-off submenus.andP;  Define function keys on a form and attach an APT-SQLroutine to each; forms called from a form can inherit its function keys.andO;Decide whether or not to run rules on the form, depending on whether it isimportant for the user to get immediate feedback if a rule is not met whendata is entered.andP;  Define custom field help.andP;  Create a values list from whichthe user can select a value andandM;transfer it to the field on the form.andM;Dynamically change properties on forms (e.g., prompts, displayandM;characteristics) at run-time in APT-SQL procedures.andP;  You can also use APT-SQLprocedures to further refine the application.andP;  The ability to execute a formwhile in design mode is extremely helpful for testing and debugging.andM;In the forms design process, we would like to see the form name displayed onscreen, the ability to draw boxes, and simpler notation for defining a fieldas all upper/lower case or all numeric.andM;There is no direct access to the interactive SQL editor in APT Workbench,which disappointed us.andP;  We were thrown into the Unix system editor (in ourcase, vi) instead.andP;  While Sybase has explained that the system editor is morepowerful and probably more familiar to the professional developer, we endusers would like the option to use the friendly Sybase editor with menusattached.andM;Sybase recommends that, in developing applications, you first complete thenecessary SQL work: creating all of the tables, triggers, rules, storedprocedures, and defaults.andP;  Then, when you build the application, you invokethe database objects as required.andP;  This allows one group of developers towork on SQL and others to design the application without knowing SQL at all.andO;Thus, the Sybase architecture makes it possible to extensively modularize thedevelopment effort.andP;  Applications are designed the same way for characterterminals and bit-mapped workstations.andM;APT Workbench is easy to learn and use, up to a certain point.andP;  Writingcomplex APT-SQL procedures is not for the end user.andP;  Once you start creatingmore complex applications with lots of processing attached to fields, forms,and menus, it gets confusing to keep it all straight-what procedure goes withwhat object.andP;  The extensive set of properties offered for each object can geta little overwhelming as well.andP;  However, for the professional developer, therich functionality and extensive flexibility of the product facilitate thedesign of very complex custom applications.andP;  SECURITY.andP;  Sybase has extensivesecurity options.andP;  It uses the standard &quot;grant&quot; and &quot;revoke&quot; commands toenforce data- base security at multiple levels.andP;  Permissions can be appliedto both database objects and commands.andP;  THE DEVELOPER'S PERSPECTIVE Weinterviewed four Sybase developers about their experiences with the productThree are VARs and one is a developer in an end-user organization.andP;  Length oftime working with Sybase ranges from six months to over two years.andP;  All haveexperience with other DBMSs, such as Oracle, Informix, and MDBS, and toolslike Focus.andP;  STRENGTHS.andP;  Several strong points were mentioned by all of thedevelopers: performance, integrity, flexibility, and the applications development environment.andP;  Performance.andP;  Performance is a key strength ofSybase.andP;  In fact, when the end-user organization tested its firstapplications with Sybase, the system went so fast they thought it wasn'tworking.andP;  Two developers have integrated Sybase with real-time data feeds.andO;In one case, the Sybase database has to poll a process control system asoften as every second while also processing user queries.andP;  Another developerstated that, although Sybase is not always faster, it is generally 1.5 to 2times faster than Oracle on similar applications.andP;  One developer describedSybase as up to 400 percent faster than other products in some cases.andO;Architectural Integrity.andP;  All are impressed with the robustness of thedatabase engine and the ability to build integrity into the back-enddatabase.andP;  They stressed the major importance and benefits of having bothstored procedures and triggers in the Sybase architecture.andP;  Flexibility.andO;Sybase offers the developer extensive options in structuring applications.andO;By providing rich functionality and different ways to do things, Sybaseallows the developer to optimize Sybase for a particular application'srequirements.andP;  For example, triggers often do things that a normalapplication would do anyway.andP;  Using both application logic and triggers canresult in a &quot;double hit&quot; on some integrity checks, which might adverselyaffect performance.andP;  Here, the developer has the choice to put the integritychecks in the back end or the front end, depending on the application.andO;Applications Development Environment.andP;  All of the developers mentioned theimpact of the Sybase architecture on designing applications.andP;  While designingagainst the architecture, with its separation of functionality between thefront and back ends, may at first look difficult, the Sybase architecture isa major strength of the product.andM;One benefit is the ability to create a database server, separating thephysical aspects of the database (database administration) from thefunctional aspects  applications development).andM;One developer states that he can build an entire application with storedprocedures and integrity mechanisms.andP;  The Sybase architecture allows you tobuild a very strong design methodology.andP;  You can build a functional prototypequickly and attach either the front or back end later, building bothseparately.&quot;andM;As a caution, one developer described the need to proceed carefully inlearning how to take advantage of the Sybase architecture in structuring anapplication.andP;  In most cases, the developer is faced with learning three newthings: a product, an architecture, and an application.andP;  This personrecommended that new developers use the &quot;old&quot; architecture more at firstuntil they achieve a level of confidence with the new architecture.andP;  Usingtriggers is a somewhat radical way of structuring an application, and thereis risk involved in using any new system for critical applications.andM;Developers in the end-user organization we spoke to took a similar approach.andO;They redeveloped some of the more complicated pieces of existing systems,pushing Sybase to the limits of their own experience before trying it on anew application.andP;  They were able to build these modules in much less time,with much less code, yet get more functionality with Sybase.andP;  And these werethe difficult applications that couldn't be done with products such as Oracleor Focus.andP;  APT-SQL Language.andP;  APT-SQL language is a well-structuredprogramming environment with the ability to manipulate objects at a highlevel.andP;  Commands are implemented at a high level of abstraction orexpression, yet the developer has control at a low level in terms ofmanipulating the primitives of the product.andP;  One example here is the abilityto change field properties dynamically.andP;  Oracle, for example, doesn't allowany manipula- tion of field properties at run-time.andM;One developer described APT-SQL as a &quot;small, elegant, and succinct language,with very little redundance.&quot; Another developer described it as  very clean.&quot;andO;C Interface.andP;  The developers also praised Sybase's programming interface,which provides the ability to shift effortlessly between APT-SQL and 3GLcode.andP;  In many competing products (e.g., Focus), the developer must exit the4GL environment to write a C program.andP;  Support.andP;  Two developers cited supportas a strength.andP;  The end-user organization stated that Sybase's technicalsupport is  excellent, just superb.andP;  They assign you a technical rep on yourfirst call.andP;  This person gets to know you, your company, and yourapplications.&quot; This developer also praised the Sybase documentation (it iseasy to read, with many helpful examples) and the Sybase training  courses.andO;Other.andP;  One developer stressed the importance of high availability.andP;  Twoindicated that the company's efforts to port only to selected platforms wasimpressive, resulting in a fighter product and the ability to maintain highquality standards.andM;One developer is impressed with the overall quality of the Sybase staff,particularly in engineering.andP;  The company brings a great deal of experienceto its product, boding well for continued improvements that will enable thecompany to maintain its state-of-the-art position.andP;  WEAKNESSES.andP;  Sybase hastwo primary weaknesses: the current limitations of the front-end tools forpresentation management, and the report writer.andP;  Presentation.andP;  All of thedevelopers mentioned the inflexibility of the Sybase front-end tools as anarea requiring improvement.andP;  The end-user company had assumed Sybase wouldhave more of a PC-like front end than it did.andP;  Problems include: When you tabinto a field in Sybase, you are put at the end of the field entry in Insertmode, though you expect to be at the beginning of the field in Overstrikemode; no support for color; no facility to draw boxes on the screen; menuscan only be a certain size at the top of the screen, taking up a lot ofunnecessary space, particularly on terminal screens; the scrolling icons canbe awkward; the arrow keys work differently than expected.andP;  Report Writer.andO;From the developer's perspective, Sybase has underestimated the need for asophisticated report writer.andP;  The report writer is fine for simple ad hocreports, but not for complex reports.andP;  The developer wants more of aprogramming language, with more functions and flexibility.andP;  One solution isto extend the 4GL code for reports.andP;  Two of the developers are using aproduct called SQR from Dandamp;N Systems (Burlington, Massachusetts) as analternative.andP;  Sybase indicates that we will see enhancements to the reportwriter this year.andP;  Other.andP;  One developer stated that Sybase needs to offertools for performance monitoring.andP;  Since Sybase is a single process to theoperating system, you cannot tell which application is causing a performanceproblem on the system.andP;  Sybase also needs better management tools for keepingtrack of source code (APr Workbench procedures).andP;  Conclusion Sybase has donea lot of things right.andP;  It has forged its  own path to success, choosing notto be just another RDBMS.andP;  The company clearly defined its objectives andtook a focused approach to both product architecture and marketing.andP;  As aresult, the RDBMS has moved to a higher level of functionality, with theability to meet the requirements of a new class of applications.andM;The company correctly anticipated important industry trends and emergingmarket needs: the move to distributed network computing, the need  forperformance and availability, and the benefits of database-enforcedintegrity.andP;  The Sybase RDBMS is designed to meet these needs, and its successis pushing the competition to meet the challenge.andM;The edge for Sybase is that its product is up and running, and the necessaryfunctionality is an integral part of its architecture.andP;  Some of itscompetitors, on the other hand, are faced with the issue of redesigning theirproducts.andP;  Oracle, Relational Technology, and Informix have all announced orimplemented OLTP versions of their database engines.andP;  They are also nowtalking about the need for stored procedures and referential integrity.andO;Perhaps Sybase has created some de facto standards of its own in theindustry.andM;Sybase faces some challenges in the near future.andP;  The introduction of APTWorkbench was long overdue and critical to the company's continued success.andO;While the initial reaction to it is very positive, the front-end tools needto grow and mature.andP;  It is also important that the company not rest on itslaurels, but continue to improve and enhance Sybase.andP;  The company plans todouble in size again over the next year.andP;  It must manage its own growth withthe same care and attention it has directed to its platform strategy.andM;We always like to see innovative newcomers like Sybase push the industryahead and keep it on its toes.andP;  And from what we have seen so far, thecompany has the potential for a very bright future.andM;Architecture                           Client/serverandM;Underlying rile structure              ProprietaryandM;Database paramandM;Databases/server                       32,767andM;Tables/database                        2 billionandM;Records/database                       UnlimitedandM;Fields/record                          250andM;Record size                            2KandM;User inteandM;Menu bypass                            NoandM;Contextual help                        YesandM;Tutorial                               No;
