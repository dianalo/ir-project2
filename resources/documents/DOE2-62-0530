This investigation is related tothe natural language processing and the knowledge base in the researchtheme of Human Acts Simulation Program (HASP) begun at the ComputingCenter of JAERI in 1987. By using a machine translation system, an attempthas been made to extract a deep knowledge from Japanese sentences whichare equivalent to a FORTRAN program CASTHY for nuclear data evaluation.With the knowledge extraction method used by the authors, the verificationof knowledge is more difficult than that of the prototyping method inan ordinary AI technique. In the early stage of building up a knowledgebase system, it seems effective to extract and examine knowledge fragmentsof limited objects.</TEXT></DOC>
