The company didn't give a specific figure for group netincome, but said it was above the year-ago figure. In 1990,group net was 1.80 billion marks on operating earnings of4.22 billion marks.</LP><TEXT>   The center of growth was Germany, where sales rose 22%,Daimler-Benz said, while sales elsewhere in Europe fellmarginally.   In the U.S., the year-earlier sales figure was &quot;slightlyexceeded.&quot;   Overall, two-thirds of the corporation's business wasaccounted for by its luxury car and truck division,Mercedes-Benz, while electronics unit AEG contributed 14%,Deutsche Aerospace 13% and services-oriented Debis, thenewest unit, 4%.   Mercedes division revenue totaled 66.71 billion marks, anincrease of 12%; AEG 14.05 billion marks, up 7%; DeutscheAerospace 12.38 billion marks, little changed from 12.525billion marks.   Mercedes automobile sales soared 25% and commercialvehicles sales 30% in Germany in 1991.   Abroad, however, those sales rose only 2% and 1%,respectively. Mercedes said those achievements &quot;didn't meetexpectations.&quot;   Overall output of Mercedes cars totaled 560,400 units,slightly below the year-earlier total of 574,227.   Car sales dropped 25% in the U.S. to 58,900 because of thesluggish economy and a luxury tax that had boosted 1990 salesin advance of the law's taking effect in January 1991.   In Japan, car sales fell 12% to 34,100 units. Mercedesnoted that it is still the top-selling foreign car label inJapan.   At AEG, the troubled Frankfurt-based electronicssubsidiary, rail systems and automation technology led saleslast year.   The performance of its office machines and communicationtechnology divisions wasn't so promising. The company spunoff its AEG Mobile Communication G.m.b.H. unit and sufferedfurther sales losses at AEG Olympia Office G.m.b.H., which isbeing phased out of existence.   Deutsche Aerospace orders totaled 10.45 billion marks, notquite as high as the year-earlier 10.81 billion marks.</TEXT></DOC>
