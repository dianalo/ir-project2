(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oregon's director of prisons was found stabbedto death outside his office at the state psychiatric hospital, and afriend said the victim had received death threats.   Corrections Department Director Michael Francke, who was foundearly Wednesday, died of a stab wound to the heart, state MedicalExaminer Larry Lewman said.   ``There are other injuries, the details of which will not bereleased at the request of the district attorney's office,'' astatement from Lewman's office said.   ``Our facts right now are _ we just don't have any,'' said Lt.Col. R.B. Madsen, deputy superintendent of the Oregon State Police.``We've got a lot of interviews to do. We don't have a suspect atthis time.''   Marion County District Attorney Dale Penn said a number of leadswere being pursued and that two possible motives were robbery orrevenge connected to Francke's work in Oregon or New Mexico.   Francke, 42, was killed sometime late Tuesday, Penn said.   Francke had received death threats, said a friend, former stateRep. Chuck Sides, who remembered an unsigned letter Francke showedhim last fall. Sides said he could remember no details of thatletter but said Francke shrugged it off with a joke about whichlegislator might have sent it.   ``Michael was getting death threats on a regular basis,'' Sidessaid. ``It was part of the job, almost.''   Sides said Francke kept a .38-caliber revolver in his car's glovecompartment, ``but other than that, I never saw him take that manyprecautions, look around the corner. He just charged ahead.''   ``This is a sad day for Oregon,'' Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said ashe ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. ``Michael Franckededicated his life to making Oregon a safer place to live.''   Since taking the Oregon post, Francke had been grappling with aheavily overcrowded prison system that led to many felons servinglittle time behind bars. The inmate population, in a system designedfor 2,800 inmates, recently hit 5,000.   Goldschmidt named Francke, former director of the New MexicoCorrections Department, to the Oregon post in May 1987.   Before coming to Oregon, Francke served as a state district judgein New Mexico from 1980 until he was named that state's correctionschief in 1983. He also served as an assistant and deputy attorneygeneral in New Mexico from 1975 to 1980.   ``All New Mexicans are indebted to Michael Francke and mourn histragic death,'' said Toney Anaya, who was governor when Francke wasnamed to head the New Mexico corrections system three years after 33people died in a bloody prison riot there.   Francke directed New Mexico's efforts to comply with a federalcourt decree that forced a reduction in the state's prisonpopulation.   Goldschmidt said Dick Peterson, the department's director ofinstitutional operations, would serve as interim department directoruntil a permanent replacement for Francke could be found.</TEXT></DOC>
