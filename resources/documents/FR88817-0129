These awards will be made to scholarswho wish to improve and expand their skills in historical, philosophical,ethical, normative, or social science studies of science, engineering andtechnology.The program's major purpose is to link opportunities for original researchto further training and study experiences. Two kinds of awards will bemade: postdoctoral fellowships and professional development awards. Thepostdoctoral fellowships are intended for recent Ph.D.'s in an area ofscience, technology and society studies (for instance, history and philosophy,ethics, sociology, psychology, or anthropology of science or technology).The professional development awards are intended to support establishedscholars from the field of science, technology and society studies to improvetheir understanding of science and technology <T3>or </T3>to support experienced scientists and engineers wishing todevelop or improve science or technology studies skills. These awards should:(1) Allow recipients to undertake original independent research and specialstudies while working with a senior sponsoring scholar or scholars; and,(2) depending on the recipients' background, enhance methodological andtechnical skills in science, technology and society studies or in areasof natural or physical sciences, mathematics or engineering.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility</ITAG>The research proposed for the awards may be in any field germane to Studiesin Science, Technology and Society areas of support. Projects in twentiethcentury science and technology, including science and technology policy,are especially encouraged. Specifically ineligible are studies in medicineand society which have a public health or clinical orientation.To be eligible for fellowships or professional development awards in Science,Technology and Society Studies, applicants must be nationals of the UnitedStates, that is, citizens of the United States or native residents of apossession of the United States. Citizens of other countries who have appliedfor United States citizenship or who have permanent residency status arenot eligible.Applicants for postdoctoral fellowships must have been awarded their firstdoctoral degree within five years of the deadline for application or realisticallyexpect to earn this degree by no later than one year after the deadline.Postdoctoral fellows must have earned the Ph.D. degree before tenure maybegin. Persons with pre-doctoral degrees in many of these fields may beeligible for doctoral dissertation support through the Foundation's doctoraldissertation research support programs (NSF 88-35].Normally applicants for professional development awards must have at leastfive years of advanced teaching and/or research experience in some fieldof science or engineering, history, philosophy, ethics, or the social studyof science, engineering or technology. Scholars without Ph.D.'s who wishto be considered for professional development awards must demonstrate tothe satisfaction of an external review panel that their training, professionalstatus, and experience are equivalent to the requirement for the Ph.D.,and that their credentials include at least five years of postdoctoral-levelresearch experience and a record of publications or comparable professionalaccomplishment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Project Sites</ITAG>During the tenure of their awards, recipients must work in establishedand fiscally responsible nonprofit host institutions (U.S. or foreign).The institutions should clearly offer the opportunity to enhance the trainingand methodological sophistication of the award recipients or offer exceptionaltutorial or collaborative relationships consistent with enhancement ofresearch quality. Accessibility to laboratory and other research sites,or to relevant archival materials should also be taken into considerationin selecting institutional affiliations.All arrangements for affiliations with senior scholars and institutionsare the responsibility of the applicants. Applications must include lettersfrom the host institutions, signed by authorized officials, affirming thatthe applicants will be welcome and will be provided with adequate spaceand basic services. They must provide statements from the senior scholarswith whom the applicants plan to work, indicating a commitment to consultationand assistance in the applicants' research and learning programs duringthe requested tenure periods. Applicants who need assistance in identifyingsuitable hosts are encouraged to contact the NSF Studies in Science, Technologyand Society Program to discuss the possibilities. For information, writeor call 202-357-9894.Preference will be given to applicants who move to new institutions andresearch environments with which they have not been affiliated at the graduateor postgraduate level, or with which they will have been affiliated forno more than three months prior to the start of fellowship tenure. Applicantswho wish to affiliate with institutions with which they have had priorassociations should have special justifications for these arrangementsin their proposals.Preference among professional development applicants will be given thosewho affiliate with host scholars from disciplines different from the categoryin which they have their degree or equivalent. Thus, a natural scientistwho affiliates with a philosopher would be preferred to one who affiliateswith another natural scientist. Similarly, an historian who affiliateswith an engineer would be preferred to one who affiliates with anotherhistorian. Under exceptional circumstances, with NSF concurrence, researchsites or host institutions may be changed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Tenure, Stipends, and Allowances</ITAG>Postdoctoral fellowships are generally awarded for one year of full-timeresearch though the funds may be used over a two year period. The fellowshipsprovide stipends of $24,000, payable at the rate of $2,000 per month; specialallowances of $2,000 expendable for supplies, special travel, publicationexpenses, and other research related costs; and separate institutionalallowances of $2,000 (for domestic host institutions only). Institutionalallowances will be paid directly to U.S. host institutions to partiallydefray administrative costs incurred in conjunction with the fellowships.No allowances for dependents are available.Professional development awards may be used to support full or half-timeactivities for up to two years. Plans for less than half-time or for intermittenttenures should provide special justification. Total stipends will not exceed$36,000. Applicants are encouraged to supplement this support from sabbaticalpay and other sources. Special allowances of $2,000 are available for supplies,special travel, publication expenses and other research related costs.Institutional allowances of $2,000 (for domestic host institutions only)will be paid directly to U.S. host institutions to defray costs incurredin conjunction with the awards. Up to $3,000 will be available for movingexpenses if necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation and Selection of Awardees</ITAG>Evaluation criteria include: the significance and intrinsic merit of theresearch and training/studies programs that are proposed; the degree ofenhancement of methodological skills and/or knowledge of science and technology;the perceived research competence and potential of the applicants; andthe suitability and availability of the sponsoring senior scholars at thehost institutions. The nature and degree of cross-disciplinary interchangeand interaction will be given significant weight, especially for the professionaldevelopment awards. Judicious selection of a research problem, logicalorganization of the learning program, clarity in project design and description,and lucid writing will weigh heavily in the evaluation process. Additionalfactors include: evidence of past research accomplishments (especiallythose documented through papers published in high-quality, peer-reviewedjournals); suitability of the host institutions; likely effect of the proposedproject on the future research development of the applicants; and the potentialimpact of the research on the field as a whole.Awards will be made by the National Science Foundation on the basis ofthe recommendations of a panel of experts applying the above criteria,with due consideration to the impact of the awards on studies in science,technology and society. Successful applicants will be notified by letter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conditions of Appointment</ITAG>Unless explained in the proposal and approved by the NSF, the postdoctoralfellows will be expected to devote full time to appropriate research duringthe tenure of the Fellowship; recipients of the professional developmentawards will generally be expected to devote at least half-time to appropriateresearch during the tenure of the award. All recipients of awards are expectedto pursue the program for which the award was granted. Major changes inthe research plan, in tenure, or institutional affiliation will requireprior Foundation approval.The annualized salaries of the recipients cannot be augmented by receiptof the award. Professional Development Award recipients may use sabbaticalleave pay along with this award. Alternatively or additionally, institutionsmay supplement stipends for both fellows and professional development awardrecipients without prior permission from the Foundation, provided thatsuch supplements are in accord with established institutional policies.Supplements may not be conditioned on any requirement for duties in additionto normal activities of the recipients and may involve teaching only tothe extent that the recipients conduct or participate in seminars clearlyrelated to their research programs. In the context of these guidelines,funds that the institution has obtained from external (including Federal)sources may be considered institutional funds. When appropriate, NSF projectgrants may be used for supplementation to recipients of these awards forduties which are related to their award programs.At the conclusion of the tenure of these awards, a brief final report usingNSF Form 98A must be submitted to NSF.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intellectual Property Rights</ITAG>The National Science Foundation claims no rights to any inventions or writingsthat might result from these awards.
