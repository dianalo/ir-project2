About 130,000 claimants and creditors are involved in the plan,which gives stockholders control of 8 percent of the Chicago-basedcompany's shares, while claimants and creditors receive 92 percent.   The reorganization plan was overwhelmingly approved this springby shareholders, most claimants and creditors.   But a group of nearly 50 claimants filed objections to the planwith the bankruptcy court. Judge David H. Coar dismissed theseobjections Thursday in approving the plan that would compensatevictims of asbestos-linked diseases and bar future lawsuits.   There were more than 100,000 claims against UNR, whose potentialliability could exceed $875 million.   For the first time in seven years, the company now will beoperating free of court jurisdiction.   ``We're trying to save the company, which isn't even in theasbestos business anymore,'' said attorney Mickey Gaynor, whohelped develop the reorganization plan for UNR, which nowmanufactures steel products. ``They've been making money. It's avery profitable company.''   Denver-based Manville Corp. has sought similar protection,citing overwhelming asbestos-related damage claims. But UNRIndustries' 1982 filing was the first seeking to use Chapter 11 ofthe Bankruptcy Code to deal with legal claims.   Asbestos, a fibrous flame-resistant mineral once widely used forinsulation, has been linked to lung cancer and other respiratoryailments. The company stopped using asbestos in 1962.   In 1968, insurance companies began denying compensation in suchcases. UNR has settled with several insurers for a total of $71.8million and is challenging additional companies.   UNR, formerly known as Union Asbestos andamp; Rubber Co., specializesin the manufacture of steel tubing, shopping carts and otherproducts for commercial and consumer uses.</TEXT></DOC>
