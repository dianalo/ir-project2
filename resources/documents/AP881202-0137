But both sides left open the possibility that a dispute overwithdrawing 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola will be resolved underU.S. mediation or will be shelved for later discussions, and that aninterim agreement will be signed.   The tentative accord provides for the Cuban troop withdrawal andfor independence for South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.   South African diplomat Glenn Babb told the British BroadcastingCorp. that the signing was delayed because Angola and Cuba rejecteda U.N. proposal for monitoring the withdrawal of the Cubans.   Babb, deputy director general of foreign affairs, said, however,``We can perhaps overcome the problem of not having a finalverification document but that is still to be discussed here.''   South African Foreign Minister Roelof Botha and Defense MinisterMagnus Malan flew to Brazzaville on Friday to join the talks.   Cuban delegates told reporters South Africa insisted it beallowed to join the team monitoring Cuban withdrawal. Cuba regardsthis as unnecessary, saying the United States can monitor thewithdrawal and report to Pretoria.   Chester Crocker, the U.S. diplomat leading the negotiations, hasmade no comment on the dispute. Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary ofstate for African affairs and architect of the peace plan, hassought to induce South Africa to grant independence to Namibia bypersuading the Cubans to withdraw from Marxist Angola, theterritory's northern neighbor.   Angolan rebels, meanwhile, vowed Friday to continue their 13-yearinsurgency if the peace talks fail to result in negotiations betweenthe rebels and the Angolan government and a genuine withdrawal ofCuban troops..   The pledge by the National Union for the Total Independence ofAngola came in a statement distributed in Lisbon, the capital ofPortugal.   The anti-communist guerrilla group has fought the government ofPresident Jose Eduardo dos Santos since losing a civil war afterAngola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.   The guerrilla movement is not party to the talks among Angola,Cuba and South Africa.   In a separate statement, the rebels said they killed 53 soldiersin clashes Wednesday in central Benguela province. They also claimedguerrillas penetrated a Cuban military base near Huambo, 162 milessouth of the capital, Luanda, and destroyed fuel stored there.   The Angolan newsagency ANGOP said troops killed 34 guerrillas infighting in Uige, Moxico and Huila provinces from Nov. 23-29 andthat the guerrillas group killed eight soldiers and 15 civiliansduring the same period. It sdaid soldiers freed 52 people held bythe rebels.   There was no independent confirmation of the reports.</TEXT></DOC>
