The Soviet reforms, however, and the increasingly obviousfailures of state-controlled economies to match Western technologyand consumer plenty have encouraged people under Communist rule todemand change.   The responses of their governments range from tinkering with theeconomy while leaving political reform alone to outright repression.Huge security networks still are deployed to crush or at least curbfree speech as aging leaders from Havana to East Berlin, Prague,Sofia and Bucharest cling to power.   The most vivid display of old-style Communist determination tostay in power at any cost has come in China.   Before the eyes of a world, hundreds, perhaps thousands, ofpro-democracy demonstrators were felled by military tanks andgunfire early in June.   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, more people have been arrested anddozens executed since.   Romania and Cuba are other examples where little has changedsince Gorbachev emerged on the world scene. In fact, conditions mayactually have deteriorated.   ``While in other Socialist countries, they are taking stepstoward a more open society, in Romania it's going exactlybackwards,'' said Paula Tscherne, who monitors human rights for theVienna-based International Helsinki Federation.   Food in shops is scarcer and rationing of bread and other staplesmore widespread the longer Nicolae Ceausescu presides over the landonce known as the breadbasket of southeastern Europe.   Senior Communists and well-known writers demanding change facehouse arrest, jail or mental hospitals; less prominent dissentersdisappear without a trace.   In Cuba, Fidel Castro, like Ceausescu, harangues Soviet-stylereform as a return to capitalism.   In an unexplained move attributed by some analysts to internalpower struggles, the nation's top general was recently executedafter being convicted of drug trafficking; three dissidents face upto four years in jail after reportedly telling foreigners thatconfessions at the trial were extracted by torture.   In rigid East Germany, desperation over the lack of political andeconomic reform is driving hundreds of thousands to apply toemigrate West.   Thousands more who can't stand the years of waiting for legalpermission to go are escaping in the biggest human flow westwardsince the Communists built the Berlin Wall in 1961.   ``We're just second-class citizens here, or worse,'' one EastGerman told Western reporters.   ``My parents said, `go, we'd go too if we were younger,''' saidan East Berlin woman in her early 20s, one of hundreds fleeingacross Hungary's newly porous border with Austria. Pointing to otheryouths who did the same, she added, ``We all work in professionswhere you actually make money in East Germany. But there's nothingto spend it on.''   Other Communist governments that have rejected genuine reformsvacillate between concessions and repression.   Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, whose Communists traditionally havepaid much heed to Moscow, have lent strong verbal support toGorbachev's perestroika, or restructuring, and claimed to beimplementing their own versions.   In both countries, however, reform seems skin-deep, limited tosome new freedom in the state-controlled arts and changes billed asimprovements in running stagnating state economies.   ``Certain surface, let's say, official improvements have beenmade,'' said Jana Starek of the International Helsinki Federation.``Unfortunately, nothing has changed as far as strictly politicalcases, cases of religious belief and independent civil organizationsare concerned.''   In Czechoslovakia, which has perhaps the strongest democratictraditions of any Soviet bloc nation, sporadic anti-governmentprotests and petitions for reform have yielded nothing but moreharassment and jail for dissidents and their supporters.   In Bulgaria, organized dissident groups have emerged forvirtually the first time under Communist rule. But activists havequickly found the limits of glasnost, Bulgarian-style, sufferingpolice harassment, imprisonment or forced emigration.   Bulgaria's ethnic Turks are fleeing by the hundreds of thousandsto Turkey after at least nine people died in May protests against anassimilation campaign and authorities began deporting dozens ofethnic Turkish activists.   In Yugoslavia, still freer in spirit than the Soviet bloc withwhich it broke in 1948, ethnic tension is also mounting, fueled byeconomic chaos resulting from a decentralized political system andstate mismanagement of agriculture and industry.   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been jailed since theyprotested last spring against constitutional changes they say curbedtheir autonomy in Yugoslavia.   While Europe's Communist nations are embroiled in upheaval,Vietnam, a nation ravaged by turmoil for decades, seems calmly to beimplementing its version of perestroika, known as ``doi moi.''   According to a recent report in the authoritative British weeklyThe Economist, ``doi moi'' has not halted the flow of boat peoplerisking their lives to escape Communist Vietnam. But it has raisedeconomic production _ and hopes _ without yet firing politicalunrest.   In Europe, steeped in traditions of individual liberty, thelifting of the rigid clamp of totalitarianism seems fraught withmore danger.   The restructuring of a vast, diverse country such as the SovietUnion seems unable to proceed without the upheaval seen in theBaltic republics, the Caucasus and in Siberian and Ukrainian miners'strikes.   Fear of such turbulence bolsters Communist governments that haveso far rejected change. In Czechoslovakia, for example, livingstandards are still relatively high and workers living for fourdecades by the East bloc motto ``we pretend to work, and theypretend to pay us'' are afraid reform will send artificially lowprices soaring and put them out of their cozy jobs.   Popular pressure for change could mount if Poland or Hungaryproves that smaller, more developed and more ethnically homogenousnations than the Soviet Union can achieve democratic reform withoutmajor upheaval.   Younger Communists also may prove more willing to countenancechange than the older leaders in power now: East Germany's ErichHonecker, 76; Czechoslovakia's Gustav Husak, 75; Bulgaria's TodorZhivkov, 77; Ceausescu, 71; and Castro, younger at 62 but at the topsince 1959.   When it does come, however, change may not be as sudden as it hasbeen in the past breathtaking months in the Soviet Union, Poland andHungary.   Interim Communist leaders may preside over a period of moregradual reform before relinquishing or sharing power, argues oneWestern analyst speaking on condition of anonymity.   ``It's not like a trigger that will suddenly produce Poszgays(Imre Poszgay is Hungary's most reform-minded Communist) orGorbachevs in East Germany,'' he added.   ``Precisely because they have held out for such a long time andtheir people see that change can be painful, these nations mightneed another tinkering period before they start on their own.''</TEXT></DOC>
