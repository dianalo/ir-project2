(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker was committed to a mentalinstitution in handcuffs and leg shackles Thursday after apsychiatrist reported the TV evangelist was hallucinating andcowering in a fetal position in his lawyer's office.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter suspended Bakker's fraud trialand ordered him to the Federal Correctional Institute in Butner forup to 60 days for psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he iscompetent to stand trial.   ``Please don't do this to me,'' a sobbing, disheveled Bakker saidas he was led from his lawyer's office by U.S. marshals to thecourthouse for processing of the commitment order. He curled up in afetal position in the back seat.   ``Mr. Bakker, I'm going to have to ask you to sit up, please,'' adeputy marshal said.   After the paperwork was completed, Bakker, bound hand and foot,was taken to Butner to spend his first night behind bars since thePTL scandal broke. The evangelist is accused of fleecing followersof his evangelical empire.   He was lying in the back seat of a marshal's car when he arrived,and a marshal held him on each side as he walked in a slow, stoopedshuffle into the prison.   Dr. Basil Jackson, a psychiatrist who has been treating Bakkerfor nine months, told the judge that Bakker began hallucinatingWednesday after a former PTL executive testifying against himcollapsed on the stand. The witness was revived within seconds andsaid he was laid low by illness.   ``Mr. Bakker reported that when he left the courthouse Wednesday,suddenly people outside took on the form of frightening animalswhich he felt were intent on destroying him, attacking him andhurting him,'' Jackson said.   Jackson said Bakker's condition worsened overnight, even after hewas given Xanax, an anti-depressant sedative. Bakker was not incourt for the hearing.   On Thursday morning, Bakker ``was lying in the corner of hisattorney's office with his head under a couch, hiding,'' Jacksonsaid. ``He was expressing thoughts that someone was going to hurthim.''   ``To put it in lay language, the man is stressed out,'' Jacksonsaid later.   Prosecution and defense lawyers are under court order not todiscuss the trial outside of the courtroom. But during the hearing,Assistant U.S. attorney Jerry Miller described the psychiatrist as a``hired gun.''   Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Scofield said most pretrialpsychiatric evaluations take about 45 days. But the judge toldjurors _ who were not told the reason for the suspension in thetrial _ to report back to court in a week.   Bakker and other PTL executives are accused of diverting fortheir own use more than $4 million of $158 million raised fromfollowers who gave $1,000 for three nights' free lodging each yearfor life at the ministry's hotels.   If convicted on all 24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120years in prison and fined $5 million.   Bakker's wife, Tammy, told reporters her husband was verydistressed by the collapse in the courtroom Wednesday of former PTLexecutive Steve Nelson, a prosecution witness.   ``I knew when I talked to Jim last night that he was in aterrible emotional trauma and I prayed with him and we agreed thatwe would trust the Lord,'' she said outside her home in Orlando, Fla.   ``I would like to tell the people, you be in our shoes and see ifyou can hold steady for 2{ years,'' she added.   Defense attorney George T. Davis told Potter that Bakker, 49,kept saying he wanted the trial to continue but was ``on the floorin a fetal position.''   ``If Mr. Bakker is handled gently and carefully he may be able toproceed with this trial,'' Davis said. The defense had tried topersuade the judge to allow Bakker to stay in a private institution.   Last year, Mrs. Bakker described a similar scene, saying in afund-raising letter to supporters that her husband had stayed in afetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the ministryin 1987.   And Jessica Hahn, the woman whose 1980 sexual encounter withBakker led to Bakker's downfall, said in a 1987 Playboy interviewthat just after the tryst, a fellow evangelist who had just comefrom Bakker's hotel room said he was ``lying in a fetal position inhis room, saying he's happy.''   ``Jim Bakker's biggest power play was and still is manipulationthrough sympathy,'' Miss Hahn said through her publicist, KariLundin, after hearing of Thursday's incident.   Jackson said his initial diagnosis was that Bakker was ``activelyhallucinating,'' suffers from ``acute depression'' and has episodeswhere he is unable ``to adequately judge and relate to reality.''   Nelson's collapse came the same day that lawyers confirmed thatanother key witness in the trial, former PTL second-in-commandRichard Dortch, was being treated at a Clearwater, Fla., hospitalfor an undisclosed ailment.   The Butner facility has been used for psychiatric evaluations ofJohn Hinckley, who shot President Reagan, and Hustler magazinepublisher Larry Flynt. It houses about 320 inmates, including about150 in the mental health unit.   Marshals said the shackles that bound Bakker are standardprocedure for moving prisoners.   A few supporters were on hand to offer encouragement.   ``He will come back,'' said Loretta Mays of Jacksonville, Fla.``Jim's a fighter. He's not a quitter ... but it will take time.''</TEXT></DOC>
