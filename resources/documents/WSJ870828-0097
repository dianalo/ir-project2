The two agencies, which are running the project jointly, decided to weed out General Electric Co. from the competition to design engines for the so-called hypersonic aircraft. Last year, the administration awarded initial contracts to GE and United Technologies to provide conceptual designs for the engine. Rockwell, which entered the project after those contracts were awarded, had funded its own early design work, a NASA official said.    The new contracts involve fabricating engine parts and testing them. In October, the administration expects to narrow the field of airframe makers to two or three contractors. It brought in five last year to conduct early design work.    The aerospace plane, sometimes called the &quot;Orient Express,&quot; would be able to travel around the world in a matter of hours. Scientists in the Defense Department and NASA are working on various aspects of the project, such as testing new materials that could withstand the intense heat of the hypersonic engine.    In other contracts awarded yesterday, the Defense Logistics Agency gave jet fuel contracts of $19.9 million and $12 million, respectively, to Mobil Oil Corp., a unit of Mobil Corp., and Laketon Refining Corp.    General Electric received a $13.6 million Air Force contract for a radar software-maintenance facility. </TEXT></DOC>
