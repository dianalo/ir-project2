Wade, chief of Telecommunications Services.andM;For the Lockerbie case, the FBI eventually set up land lines to the U.S.andO;Embassy in London, from which the State Department provided overseas linksback to Washington.andP;  The State Department is responsible fortelecommunications links between the FBI's 17 legal attaches at overseasembassies and the United States.andM;Satellite links are temporary until a command center can be set up andpermanent land links established.andP;  But sometimes satellite links turn out tobe the only way to communicate.andM;When Hurricane Hugo devastated St. Croix last year, all communications on theisland were wiped out.andP;  The FBI got involved because a prison was &quot;basicallyblown apart by the hurricane and everybody got out,&quot; Wade said.andM;With a portable satellite terminal and a portable Honda generator, Wade said,&quot;Our people had the only communications on St. Croix.&quot;andM;Likewise, during riots in 1987 at an alien detention center in Oakdale, La.,andO;satellite terminals proved invaluable for access to FBI computer facilities.andO;&quot;Most of the law enforcement in the area showed up and everybody needed atelephone,&quot; Wade said.andM;The bureau transmitted slow-speed video from Lockerbie and St. Croix.andP;  &quot;In amatter of minutes, we had pictures of the situation,&quot; Wade said.andP;  &quot;We're notCBS or ABC, but we need to be able to see an image of what it's like atground zero.&quot;andM;The most-publicized FBI telecommunications facility supports the NationalCrime Information Center (NCIC) with an unclassified network linking stateand local law enforcement agencies to FBI mainframes in Washington.andM;NCIC now uses a DataPhone II network leased from ATandamp;T Co.andP;  Under FTS 2000,the bureau will move NCIC over to US Sprint Communications Co. fiber-opticfacilities by the end of fiscal 1991.andM;Initially, the bureau plans on relatively slow transmission at 9,600bits/sec.andP;  Improved NCIC 2000 services will call for transmission of mugshots, fingerprints and other images, requiring eventual network upgrades tohandle the increased data flow.andM;&quot;From a networking standpoint, we're quite happy being on the fiber network,&quot;Wade said.andP;  &quot;Bandwidth really is not a question.andP;  It is a matter of what youorder, not physical installation.andP;  As the state need more bandwidth, we'lljust upgrade that portion of the network.&quot;andM;Wade said fiber has other advantages besides easy upgrades.andP;  &quot;Because of thecapacity it carries, when a fiber gets cut, [the vendor] goes all out to getit fixed.andM;&quot;Our experience in major cuts of fiber is four hours to recovery, and thegovernment doesn't have to pay for it.andP;  We could never get that kind ofrecovery operating on copper, which usually takes overnight,&quot; he said.andM;The FBI also runs several classified networks.andP;  Nearly all internalapplications and data communications move over the bureau's ComputerApplications Communications Network (CACN), a worldwide, secure, end-to-endnetwork with 15 1.544-megabit/sec T1 links.andM;CACN is fully redundant.andP;  &quot;There is no single point of failure that cannot bebypassed with immediate rerouting of the traffic,&quot; said FBI IRM chief WilliamA. Bayse.andM;The network has three control centers, another feature that protects againstbreakdown.andP;  The T1 portion of CACN connects three regional data centers,including one at Washington headquarters, with the top 12 field offices.andO;Each of the smaller field offices has at least one 56-kilobit/sec line andone 9,600-bit/sec line as primary and secondary links.andM;Network service to the bureau's 400 resident agencies, with one to 40 agentseach, depends on their activity.andP;  A one-agent office works on a dial-upbasis.andP;  A larger agency operates with either a multidrop configuration or adedicated full-time line.andM;With few exceptions, the field offices have IBM Corp. 3720 or 3725communications controllers that act as minor network nodes.andP;  each has twolinks to mainframe facilities: a direct link and a backup through anotherfield office.andM;CACN contains two classified subnets.andP;  The Secure Automated Message Networkis a &quot;Defense Data Network clone scaled and configured to our needs,&quot; Baysesaid.andP;  The other is the Intelligence Information System, which carriescompartmentalized intelligence and terrorist information.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
