Although the conditions are better than in many other Swissjails, they are far being from the plush surroundings to which heis accustomed.   Khashoggi, once reputed to be among the world's richest men,does not have to wear prison clothes and can order out for meals,some of which he has had delivered from the Schweizerhof hotel.   He was staying at the hotel in Bern, the Swiss capital, when hewas arrested Tuesday on a U.S. warrant charging he helped oustedPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda hideriches stolen from their country.   The 54-year-old Khashoggi was allegedly the main middleman andfinancier in the Iran-Contra affair and has been involved inseveral kickback scandals. But this is the first time he's beenarrested.   He has been held in a downtown Bern jail reserved for people inpretrial protective custody.   Like most prisoners there, he has a room to himself. It measuresabout 30 square feet and is furnished with a bed, table, chair,sink and toilet.   ``All the furniture is bolted down,'' said Bern investigatingmagistrate Alexander Tschappat.   A radio is in the room and Khashoggi can rent a television forone franc (about 60 cents) a day.   ``He can also read and write and buy newspapers. But he can'thave technical things like a telephone,'' Tschappat said.   Khashoggi is not receiving special treatment, Tschappat said ina telephone interview.   He said all prisoners could keep their watches and otherpersonal belongings with them, such as family photos _ ``but youusually deposit all your valuables so there is no danger ofsomething being stolen.''   Inmates can receive visitors three days a week for two hours inthe afternoon, Tschappat said.   He said prisoners can exercise regularly, though the prison ``isnot a big place. You can't play tennis or anything.''   The prison holds about 110 inmates, and is ``usually fullybooked,'' he said.   Swiss legal sources said Wednesday that Khashoggi likely willhave to stay in jail until the Justice Ministry rules on anextradition request that United States has said it would filewithin 60 days.   If the Swiss approve the demand, Khashoggi can appeal to theFederal Tribunal, Switzerland's supreme court, a process that couldtake months.   Swiss law also allows him to turn himself over to U.S.authorities before the extradition request arrives. He could thenseek release on bail in the United States.   But even then, the United States would have to submit theextradition request for a ruling by Swiss authorities. It will beneeded because Switzerland does not allow extradited suspects to betried abroad on charges not considered criminal under Swiss law.   Khashoggi is charged in a U.S. indictment with racketeering,conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud by posing as theowner of some of the allegedly stolen Philippine assets to protectthem against possible seizure.   If convicted, he could draw up to 65 years in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
