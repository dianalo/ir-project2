(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When the exclusive Inn at LittleWashington opened in an abandoned garage in 1978, some of the 250residents of this northwestern Virginia hamlet considered itsnameplate, well, belittling.   The sign, and the residents' fury, eventually faded.   But now the award-winning inn, some of whose celebrity gueststravel the 67 miles from Washington, D.C., by helicopter, is againprovoking the wrath of neighbors who fear for the town's seclusionand its 200-year-old heritage.   The Mobil Travel guide ranks it as the only five-star inn in thecountry. Craig Claiborne, former food columnist of The New YorkTimes, called it ``one of the most exciting retreats in all ofAmerica.'' Paul Newman, who celebrated a birthday there, called it``a most satisfying slice of comfort and royalty.''   Rooms cost $210 to $490 a night, dinner will set you back $68 onweeknights and $88 on Saturdays, and the waiting list islengthening, said innkeepers Patrick O'Connell and Reinhardt Lynch.They want to triple the capacity of the 10-room inn by adding 22rooms and a pool.   ``We thought the town would be absolutely thrilled to havesomething magnificent,'' O'Connell said. ``What is so astonishingis people drive in, stay overnight and leave. This doesn't impactthe schools or police. It's clean tourism dollars.''   But opponents cannot stomach an expansion, even if it isdesigned to fit in with its homely surroundings.   The Town Council on Wednesday considers the necessary zoningchange. It has a year to make a decision.   ``I think it's a little too great for this small town,'' saidKermit Weakley, a 20-year resident.   The inn became the key point in recent local elections. Bothformer Councilman William Wickens, who once proposed a ban on thehelicopter landings, and Lynch lost a bid for the council.   Others cannot understand the fuss.   ``You'd think we were talking about a high-rise Holiday Inn,''said Charles Eldred, who owns a shop and a house across from theinn. ``They're wonderful neighbors.''   Mayor Dean Morehouse favors a middle course _ a limitedexpansion.   ``One thing we don't want to end up with is a huge whiteelephant in the middle of our small town,'' he said. The inngenerates $65,000 of the town's $130,000 budget, he said.   The four-block town has a restaurant, beauty salon and bank butno traffic lights. Its theater has a volunteer staff and is openonly on Friday and Saturday nights.   Official letterheads describe the town as ``The First Washingtonof All,'' and residents proudly say George Washington surveyed ithimself.   When they decided to start the inn, Lynch and O'Connell wererunning a catering business from their nearby farm.   Their creation produced instant hostility when they hung out thesign. Some residents said the ``Little'' was negative, butO'Connell said they used the name affectionately. Besides, the signcost $1,000, or about a fifth of their net worth in 1978, he said.   Today, their worth is more than $3 million, and the inn has astaff of 55.   The inn has 24-hour room service. Each of the European-stylerooms is lavishly furnished with English antiques. The canopiedbeds are draped with imported fabrics. The bathrooms, some withJacuzzis, are done in brass and marble.   ``We want to offer personal service, much like being insomeone's grand country house, but also offer the discerningtraveler anything they can find in a luxury hotel with morecharm,'' O'Connell said.</TEXT></DOC>
