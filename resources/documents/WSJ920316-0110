Besides earning credits by purchasing old cars fromconsumers, companies in polluted cities might be encouragedto help pay for auto tune-ups or allow employees to workflexible hours to reduce commuting time, for instance. Theyalso might be able to get credits against theirpollution-reduction requirements for taking such steps asgetting more employees to ride in car pools or on publictransit.</LP><TEXT>   Companies that earn credits by meeting theirpollution-reduction obligations could sell them to otherpolluters, who otherwise might face more formidablesmog-reduction costs. Creating local markets in pollutioncredits, the theory goes, would let companies find thecheapest ways of meeting their obligations.   Cities could get credits, too -- for instance, byimproving traffic flow. They could then use such credits toease other pollution controls. Details of the plan are stillbeing worked out, but parts of it are likely to be unveiledthis week.   Robert Hahn, an economist at the American EnterpriseInstitute who has been advising the administration on theprogram, said the plan &quot;opens the door to change the waywe've been regulating&quot; the environment.   Environmental groups, which have been harshly critical ofthe administration's efforts on air pollution, weresupportive of the concept but wary of the details. &quot;We wantto look under the hood to see if it's a good program or alemon,&quot; said David Doniger, senior attorney at the NaturalResources Defense Council.   The centerpiece of the program is the cash-for-clunkerdeal. Consumers in participating cities would be paid roughly$700 to $1,000 for cars built before 1980; the focus would beon older cars because they cause far more pollution thannewer models. The program would be most attractive to suchcities as Los Angeles, New York and Houston, which have theworst pollution problems and large numbers of old cars. Anadministration planning document, for example, says it couldcost a factory in Los Angeles $25,000 to reduce smog by oneton, while buying and junking cars would cost no more than$3,000 a ton.   How much pollution credit a company gets for scrapping oldcars would depend on the city, how much salt is used to clearstreets and the mix of cars remaining on the road, amongother factors. The size of the credits, in turn, woulddetermine how much a company could offer for a car. A 1979car in heavily polluted Los Angeles, where cars last a longtime, for example, would likely bring higher offers than onein Tulsa, Okla., where the air is cleaner, or in Denver,where cars don't last as long.   The city or company running the clunker program woulddecide what model years it would accept and how much it wouldpay. To make sure that autos are being taken off the roadrather than out of somebody's back yard or from some otherplace, a vehicle would qualify only if it was registered inthe same area for the previous year. And for a company to getcredit, it would have to prove that the car had beendestroyed.   The administration estimates that if 200,000, pre-1971cars were scrapped, that would reduce pollution fromhydrocarbons by 31,800 tons, nitrogen oxide by 8,400 tons,carbon monoxide by 235,000 tons and carbon dioxide by 981,000tons over three years. This assumes that all the people whoturn in cars start driving newer ones.   Most owners of the scrapped cars presumably would buyother used cars. The administration estimates that under itsscenario, only about 2,200 brand new cars a year would bebought. Auto makers have been urging the administration toauthorize the destruction of newer cars to give sales abigger boost.   Separately, President Bush announced in Detroit that theadministration won't issue a rule requiring auto makers toinstall special canisters to catch gasoline vapors that leakout during refueling. The decision, which was expected, wasvigorously sought by the auto industry and was disclosed daysbefore the Michigan primary.   Environmental Protection Agency administrator WilliamReilly said he decided against requiring canisters because ofsafety concerns. Instead, gasoline stations in 55 pollutedmetropolitan areas in 28 states will have to have specialnozzles on their pumps to catch the fumes. The cost of thisrequirement, which is opposed by the oil industry, isestimated at $20,000 for a typical gasoline station.   The canister announcement drew criticism fromenvironmentalists and some lawmakers, who accused thepresident of selectively announcing actions that pleaseindustry while delaying rules that industry opposes. Forinstance, the administration has delayed a Clean Air Act ruleunder which a wide range of companies would have to getpermits specifying that their emissions don't exceed legallimits. &quot;Rules that implement the pollution-controlrequirements in the act are being stalled, weakened andquashed, while rules that provide exemptions, waivers orbailouts move quickly,&quot; said Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.).</TEXT></DOC>
