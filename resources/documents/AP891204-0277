Zdenek Jung, deputy director at the Czechoslovak FederalMinistry of Foreign Trade, said the process of decentralization andelimination of state central planning was not a short-term measurebut a ``serious process of reshaping our economy and society.''   Speaking on the opening day of the annual meeting of the97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Jung saidexisting and planned reforms were designed to create the political,legal and economic basis for Czechoslovakia's increased involvementin the world economy.   Jung called on other countries to help economic liberalizationin Czechoslovakia by easing trade restrictions, citing the exampleof European Community limits on certain Czech exports.   Poland's deputy minister for foreign economic relations, Dr.Janusz Kaczurba, said Warsaw planned to renegotiate its terms ofmembership of GATT as part of the Solidarity-led government'sefforts to ``build a liberal, efficient and open economy.''   He said Poland wanted to normalize its status in theinternational body and adopt the ``normal commitments based ontariff concessions,'' and other trade liberalizing agreements.   Poland became a member of GATT in the late 1960s after giving apromise to increase its imports from other member countries by 7percent per year. But it did not commit itself to other GATT rules,such as those on import duties, quotas and subsidies.   Kaczurba told the meeting that Poland had a new tariff scheduleto conform with GATT rules, and was in the final stages of talkswith the International Monetary Fund on convertibility of foreignexchange, liberalization of imports and the dismantling of domesticsubsidies.   The meeting also heard thinly-veiled criticism of the UnitedStates for its threats to use a new section of its trade act toretaliate against countries accused of unfair restrictions againstU.S. exports if its grievances were not settled in bilateral talks.   EC official Roderick Abbot said the tendency toward bilateralismand unilateral solutions to trade difficulties were a ``danger'' toGATT's multilateral system.   India's ambassador to GATT, Balkrishan Zutshin, appealed against``this approach of contention and confrontation,'' although he didnot refer to the United States directly.   India was one of three countries singled out for potentialretaliation under Section 301 of the U.S. trade act because of itsrestrictions on foreign investment.   Texts of speeches to the closed meeting were made available toreporters.   In addition to hearing general observations on the world tradingsystem, the meeting adopted by consensus a report by a GATTarbitration panel that ruled against Canadian restrictions oncertain dairy imports, a GATT official said on condition ofanonymity.   Canada's ambassador to GATT, John Weekes, said he would notblock adoption of the report, though Canada would continuerestricting imports of yogurt and ice cream pending new rules onagriculture drawn up as part of the ambitious Uruguay Round ofTrade liberalizing negotiations. The four-year round is scheduledto end next December.   In the Canadian case, raised by the United States, Canada arguedits restrictions were a necessary part of its program to manage thedomestic supply of dairy products.   The GATT official also said that the United States had agreed tothe establishment of a GATT panel to look into a complaint byCandada against U.S. duties on Canadian pork exports.   Members of GATT, which draws up world trade agreements and actsas a mediator in trade disputes, account for more than four-fifthsof the world's international trade.</TEXT></DOC>
