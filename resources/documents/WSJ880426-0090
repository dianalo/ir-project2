Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FGRP BTI </CO><IN> TNM INS </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Farmers Group Inc., the object of a $4.5 billion hostile tender offer from B.A.T Industries PLC, said it ended talks with a third party, which it didn't identify, concerning a possible leveraged buy-out.    The insurance holding company reaffirmed its opposition to B.A.T's $63-a-share tender offer, saying it wants to remain independent. It added that it is &quot;continuing to explore possible alternatives.&quot;    The company didn't specify the alternatives it is exploring, but it has said in previous Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it is considering a recapitalization or restructuring, the creation of a leveraged employee stock ownership plan, the sale of stock to a third party, a stock buy-back or an extraordinary dividend to shareholders.    Stock traders reacted negatively to Farmers' announcement, sending its shares down $1.375, to close at $$61.75 a share in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.    Two weeks ago, Farmers' stock price was buoyed by the company's announcement that it was willing to open talks with B.A.T, a London-based retailing, tobacco and financial services concern. But B.A.T subsequently refused to sign a confidentiality agreement that Farmers had demanded as a condition for providing nonpublic information about its finances, and no talks have resulted.    In London, a B.A.T spokesman said the company, one of Britain's largest, &quot;never seriously believed&quot; that Farmers would mount a leveraged buy-out. The Farmers announcement &quot;merely confirms what we thought all along,&quot; he said.    After B.A.T declined to sign Farmers' confidentiality agreement, B.A.T Chairman Patrick Sheehy contended in a letter to Farmers directors that they would violate their fiduciary duties to Farmers shareholders if they approved a leveraged buy-out.    In addition, leveraged buy-outs haven't become as popular in the insurance business as in other industries, largely because insurance companies have an inherently leveraged capital structure already, and state insurance regulators view the assumption of a big debt load with suspicion.    In a leveraged buy-out, the purchase of a company is financed almost entirely with borrowed funds. The debt is paid with funds generated by operating profit or the sale of assets. In the case of Farmers, borrowings of several billion dollars would be required.    Speculation about the identity of Farmers' partner in the leveraged buy-out talks centered on the New York-based firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which is one of the few buy-out specialists with enough capital to handle a deal for Farmers. The firm declined to comment.    The focus of the Farmers battle is likely to return to B.A.T's applications for approval from nine state insurance regulators to buy a controlling interest in Farmers. Farmers is contesting the applications, and hearings in some states are scheduled over the next few weeks.    ---   Barbara Toman in London contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
