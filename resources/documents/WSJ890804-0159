Like a schoolboy, he was led back to his seat.    There's no sign of relief ahead for smokers like that man, and he may even find it getting worse. The most powerful group on his side -- the Tobacco Institute -- has caved in, at least partly: On Wednesday, a spokeswoman confirmed that the tobacco-industry organization is telling lawmakers that it won't oppose legislation that would permanently extend the smoking ban on domestic flights of two hours or less.    The Tobacco Institute spokeswoman declined to comment on why the industry won't fight the short-flight ban. But observers see the move as an effort to head off demands by anti-smoking groups and many lawmakers to expand the ban to include flights of any and all lengths.    The Tobacco Institute is &quot;in the business of making political compromises to save cigarette sales,&quot; asserts Ahron Leichtman, president of Citizens Against Tobacco Smoke, which is shooting for a total smoking ban on all flights.    Congress currently is considering renewal of the two-hour flight law, which is due to expire next April. The House, in fact, voted Wednesday to permanently extend it. The Senate subcommittee on transportation, meanwhile, has proposed a wider bill that would prohibit smoking on all domestic and international flights. This battle to expand the no-smoking ban to all flights will continue when the Senate takes up the issue after its vacation.    The current smoking ban covers 80% of all domestic flights and 63% of all airline passengers.    The 1986 Surgeon General's report on the effects of involuntary smoking is the capstone for the argument to not only continue, but broaden the current ban. The report concluded that passive smoking does lead to disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers.    &quot;We have taken a major step to protect our nation's health by restricting tobacco use in . . . the airline cabin,&quot; says Rep. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), a co-author of the current smoking ban. &quot;It would be foolish to retreat from that historic decision.&quot;    The tobacco industry, while ready to compromise on short flights, continues to oppose a smoking ban on all flights. &quot;Legislating a smoking ban aboard commercial airliners would provide little more than an illusionary quick fix for complex airline cabin environmental concerns,&quot; says Charles Whitley, a Tobacco Institute spokesman.    The institute argues that poor ventilation in aircrafts is the real issue. It says that eliminating tobacco smoke would still leave a host of other harmful chemicals in the air, including cyanide, arsenic, formaldehyde, methane and ammonia.    The industry group, which was taken by surprise when the ban was imposed last year, this time has initiated a grass-roots campaign to unite smokers on the issue. It also has increased Capitol Hill lobbying efforts. Additional leverage is the $123,400 that the institute spent last year for honoraria, ranking them as the top giver of any interest group. The institute paid speaking fees to 85 House members and eight senators, according to Common Cause, the self-styled citizens lobby.    Advocates for the smoking ban contend that most of the flying public wants the ban. The American Association for Respiratory Care surveyed 27,677 people in 66 domestic airports and found the following: 84% approve of the current ban; 58% of smokers and 93% of nonsmokers approve of the ban; 52% of smokers and 91% of nonsmokers favor a permanent ban. Smokers made up 25% of those polled.    Still pending is a Transportation Department study of the health effects of cigarette smoke in airplane cabins. The department isn't taking a stance on legislation until the study is finished, expected early next year. </TEXT></DOC>
