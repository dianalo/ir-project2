Amid warnings of coastal tides five to seven feet above normal,St. Bernard Parish officials evacuated the fishing villages ofHopedale, Yscloskey and Shell Beach east of New Orleans late Mondaynight.   Beryl was upgraded Monday from a tropical depression after itswinds strengthened, reaching a sustained speed of 50 mph withhigher gusts in squalls up to 75 miles from the center.   The storm formed inland over Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleansand strengthened as it drifted closer to the warm Gulf of Mexico.   The storm didn't deter Vice President George Bush from visitingNew Orleans on Monday where he addressed the 1988 RepublicanPlatform Committee. The Republican National Convention will be nextweek Louisiana Superdome.   ``Better this week than next week,'' said Bill Phillips,convention manager.   At midnight EDT, the storm's center was near latitude 29.5 northand longitude 89.0 west, or about 65 miles southeast of NewOrleans. It had remained stationary for about six hours, afterearlier drifting slowly southeastward.   Forecasters said Beryl was expected to begin a slow southerly orsouthwesterly drift Tuesday with some strengthening possible andpossible flooding especially in coastal communities east of theMississippi River.   ``It's highly unusual for depressions to form over land. Most ofthe time they get their start way out in the middle of the ocean,''said Jim Gross, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center inMiami. ``We don't have a lot of experience with systems that formthis way.''   A tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its windshit 39 mph, and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph.   Residents of south Louisiana, especially in coastal communities,were warned to prepare for flooding from high tides.   ``Right now we're advising people to listen to their radios andwatch television,'' said Andy Valence, mayor of Grand Isle, La.,about 40 miles south of New Orleans in the Gulf of Mexico.   Tropical storm warnings were posted from Morgan City, La., toPensacola in the Florida Panhandle; a small vessels warning was ineffect from Port O'Connor, Texas, to Pensacola.   Chevron spokesman Jonathan Lifa said about 2,000 company workerswere removed Monday by boat and helicopter from facilities atVenice and Leeville deep in Plaquemines Parish and at Morgan City.   ``The concern is that the more it gets into the Gulf, the morewinds pick up. It is something we are very concerned about,'' Lifasaid.   Jim Shugart, area manager for Petroleum Helicopters Inc.,expected to spend the day getting workers out of danger.   ``It looks like we're in for a full day of flying,'' he said.``We'll just keep flying for as long as we can or until most of itis over.''   Beryl is the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricaneseason. The season's first tropical storm, Alberto, fizzled outMonday near the Canadian coast. Shortly after noon Sunday, theforecasters had issued a tropical storm warning for Maine's coastfrom Bar Harbor to Eastport, but canceled it in less than six hours.   Rain from Beryl battered coastal areas Monday in Louisiana,Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, and some tourists cut theirvacations short.   ``We've had a lot of checkouts,'' said JoAn Burt, generalmanager at the 102-room Econo-Lodge in Gulf Shores, Ala.   Carrie Thomas, who manages the Alabama Gulf Coast ConventionCenter, said guests who checked out early Monday complained aboutthe weather. ``They don't want to get stuck in the event of a bigstorm,'' she said.   Meteorologist Tom Kriehn in Mobile, Ala., said residents therecould expect 5 or 6 inches of rain in the next day or two. But hesaid Beryl could sit in the Gulf two or three days until it gainsstrength or dies.   Typically, there are 10 named storms during the six-monthhurricane season, which begins June 1. Last year, there were onlythree hurricanes and four tropical storms in the Atlantic.   The last major Gulf Coast hurricane was Camille in 1969, with218 mph winds. It killed 320 people and did millions in damage.</TEXT></DOC>
