Federal prosecutors tried to prove that tapes such as ``Prisonerof Pleasure'' and ``Kneel Before Me'' could by judged by LosAngeles standards as patently offensive.   The judge said that in a small community, perhaps, the videoscould be deemed obscene. But he added that ``the court can't say itin Los Angeles in this day and age.''   Attorneys on both sides said the ruling may change thegovernment's courtroom tactics, allowing films to stand on theirown as evidence rather than calling in expert witnesses to testifyabout community standards.   ``It's an important case and in any future case tried in federalcourt, it will be cited,'' said defense attorney Stanley Fleishman.   The case centered on interpretations of the U.S. Supreme Court's1973 decision that found that to be obscene, material must appealto the prurient interest, depict sexual conduct in a manner thatwould be patently offensive judged by the community's standards,and lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.   Rubin Gottesman, 56, owner of X-Citement Video Inc. and R.G.Sales Co., still faces two charges of interstate transportation ofchild pornography and one charge of conspiracy for selling filmsstarring porn star Traci Lords.   Gottesman testified that he did not know Miss Lords was under 18years old when she made most of her films.</TEXT></DOC>
