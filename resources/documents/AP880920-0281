Kohlberg Kravis _ which earlier this year outbid Dart for Stop andamp;Shop Cos. _offered to pay $58.50 per share for each of Kroger's78.6 million outstanding shares, or a total of $4.6 billion.   The New York-based Kohlberg Kravis said in a letter to Kroger itproposed to buy the retailer for a combination of cash, debt andequity in the company that would formed after a buyout.   On Monday, the Haft family that controls Dart offered $55 pershare, or a total of $4.32 billion, to buy Kroger. A Dartspokesman, Stanley Rubenstein, said the Landover, Md.-based companyhad no comment on the competing Kohlberg Kravis offer.   Kroger stock soared after the Kohlberg Kravis announcement,closing at $56.25 a share, up $3.50 from Monday in New York StockExchange composite trading.   Kroger reacted to the latest offer as it did to the Dart bid,saying it was reviewing the proposal but would continue to explorethe possibility of a restructuring.   Last week, Kroger said it was considering a $3.8 billionrestructuring that could make the company less attractive for abuyout. The Cincinnati-based retailer's board of directors was toreview the proposal by the end of this month, the company said.   In its letter Tuesday, Kohlberg Kravis noted the restructuringproposal and the Dart offer, and said its own bid ``will betterserve the interests of the company and its shareholders.''   The investment firm said it would pay $50 in cash, plus $8.50 insecurities for each Kroger share.   Dart Chairman Herbert Haft also told Kroger in a letter madepublic Monday his company was offering shareholders a better dealthan the restructuring plan. Haft offered $43 cash per share andsecurities with a trading value of about $12 per share.   Kroger said its restructuring would involve a special dividendof $40 a share in addition to a junior subordinated debenture witha trading value of about $8 per share. The company has declinedfurther comment on what the restructuring would involve.   Analyst Elizabeth M. Shiels of the investment firm HilliardLyons Inc., Louisville, Ky., said Tuesday the added pressure onKroger made it likely the company would sell off some of its assets_ either as part of the proposed restructuring or under newownership.   Kroger would most likely keep its core supermarket business butwould consider selling its food production or convenience storeoperations, she said.   ``I think no matter who acquires the company, those are likelycandidates,'' said Ms. Shiels.   ``It'll become a smaller company, it'll become a leanercompany,'' she said.   Kroger operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 conveniencestores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. It also processesa variety of food products for sale in its retail stores and tooutside customers.   Dart owns the Crown Books bookstore chain and the auto partsretailer Trak Auto Stores.   The Kroger bid was the first takeover offer Dart has made sinceit lost a battle for Stop andamp; Shop to Kohlberg Kravis in February.Dart made a hostile $1.03 billion offer for Stop andamp; Shop, but theHafts' target agreed to a $1.2 billion leveraged buyout by KohlbergKravis.   Herbert Haft and his son Robert have earned reputations ascorporate raiders because they have bought up big stakes inretailers, made unsuccessful takeover bids and then profited fromthe sale of their stock when the companies bought back the sharesor went private in buyouts by other companies.   Their targets in the past have included Supermarkets GeneralCorp., Safeway Stores Inc. _ both supermarket companies _ and theDayton Hudson Corp. retailer.   The Hafts maintain they are interested in buying and operating aretail company.</TEXT></DOC>
