Holdings Inc. said it reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over charges that the troubled homebuilder improperly recorded real-estate swaps as profitable sales.    In its administrative order, the SEC charged that M.D.C. didn't properly record or account for eight real-estate transactions between 1985 and 1987. In one instance, the SEC said M.D.C. sold three properties in California in August 1987 to a buyer financed by a California thrift, and on the same day purchased residential property in Phoenix, Ariz., from a land developer affiliated with the same thrift.    M.D.C. booked a $2.2 million gain from the California property sales. But an M.D.C. internal review and the SEC's review concluded that the transactions were actually an exchange of properties and the gain shouldn't have been recorded.    In other transactions, the SEC said M.D.C. booked gains or losses on properties that the company sold in 1986 and then repurchased several months later.    In two other instances, former M.D.C. employees, using money borrowed from the company, bought commercial properties from two sellers who agreed to buy homes from M.D.C. as part of the transaction. M.D.C. initially booked profits on those home sales; the SEC concluded that the transactions were related.    In agreeing to the administrative order, M.D.C. neither admitted to nor denied the charges. However, M.D.C. agreed to amend a footnote in its 1988 annual report to change the way it presented its quarterly 1987 results, showing that it overstated third-quarter results by $1.2 million and understated fourth-quarter results by almost $1 million.    M.D.C. also agreed to hire an independent auditor to study its internal accounting controls and make recommendations for improvements. It must follow those recommendations and disclose them.    The homebuilder said it took a $4.2 million charge in 1988 to reflect the cumulative effect of changing the accounting for those real-estate deals. </TEXT></DOC>
