British soccer has long been plagued by fan violence and crowdcontrol problems. Last year, a crowd crush at Hillsborough Stadiumin Sheffield left 95 dead.   The worst violence was in the south coast resort town ofBournemouth, where hometown fans clashed Friday night and Saturdaywith police and visiting fans from Leeds.   At least 50 people were arrested and charged with assault,criminal damage or public order offenses, police said early Sunday.At least 20 people, including six police officers, were hurt,police said.   In the hours before Saturday's game, 2,000 fans _ many withouttickets or with forged tickets _ began showering police with rocks,bricks and bottles and threatening Bournemouth players. Policebrought in reinforcements from as far away as London, 95 miles away.   The trouble began the night before the match, when about 100soccer fans set fire to Bournemouth's famous pier and smashedwindows at a posh shopping arcade. About 300 others attackedworkers and customers at a seaside pub and tore apart furniture,authorities said.   ``I have been in Bournemouth for 33 years and I have never seenscenes like that before, and that includes the mods and rockers inthe '60s,'' said assistant chief police constable Alan Rose.   At Chesterfield, just south of Sheffield, 12 people were takento the hospital and others were treated at the stadium afterclashes between rival fans and police. None of the injuries wassaid to be serious, but there were 30 arrests.   Trouble was also reported in Shrewsbury, in central England,where visiting fans from Preston battled with hometown supporters.A match in Birmingham had to be halted twice by the referee whenfans ran onto the field, and several people were arrested, butpolice said no exact figure was available.</TEXT></DOC>
