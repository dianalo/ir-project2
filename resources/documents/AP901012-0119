The Palestine Liberation Organization requested the meeting inthe hope Arab countries will issue a joint protest against Monday'sslayings, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The sources said a quorum of 11 members of the 21-member leaguehad agreed to attend the meeting Wednesday, but refused to identifythem.   Arab diplomatic sources named nine members who agreed to themeeting, including the PLO, Iraq, Jordan, Sudan, Yemen, Algeria,Tunisia, Mauritania and Morocco.   It was not known whether the members will be represented bytheir foreign ministers or their permanent delegates to the leagueheadquarters in Tunis.   The diplomatic sources noted most of the Arab countries alignedagainst Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis - including Egypt, Syriaand Saudi Arabia - have not yet responded to the PLO's request fora meeting.   The gulf crisis has caused a deep split within the league'sranks. The PLO has sided with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whoseforces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat urged Arab countries on Wednesday to``make a common front against the butchery against Palestinians bythe forces of Zionist occupation,'' referring to Israel.   The PLO's 90-member central committee ended three days of talksThursday with a demand that the United Nations take measures toguarantee the protection of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip, PLO spokesman Yasser Abd Rabbo said.   The PLO and the United States have been at odds over thecontents of a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israelfor the Temple Mount slayings. The United States has tried to limitthe mandate of any U.N. team sent to investigate the incident.</TEXT></DOC>
