The Delaware Supreme Court agreed to hear British publisherRobert Maxwell's appeal of a lower court ruling relating toMacmillan's merger agreement with a rival suitor and set oralarguments for Nov. 2.   The publishing giant has agreed to be acquired in a leveragedbuyout for $2.5 billion by a group led by the investment firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and including Macmillan seniormanagement.   Maxwell has offered $2.51 billion for Macmillan under certainconditions through his Maxwell Communication Corp.   Earlier in the day, the Delaware Chancery Court issued apreliminary injunction preventing the Kohlberg group fromcompleting its tender offer for Macmillan's stock until Maxwellcould appeal. That order will apparently remain in effect untilafter the Supreme Court issues a decision in the case.   ``Nothing can happen until November. Neither side can changetheir offer. The status quo is maintained,'' said Macmillanspokesman David Jackson.   ``It doesn't come as a surprise,'' said a top Maxwell financialadviser, Robert S. Pirie. ``This is a major case under Delaware lawand I would have been surprised if the Supreme Court hadn't agreedto hear it.''   The court action in Wilmington, Del., came a day after JudgeJack Jacobs refused to grant a preliminary injunction requested byMaxwell against a ``lock-up'' provision that Macmillan grantedKohlberg.   The provision would give Kohlberg the right to buy four ofMacmillan's businesses for about $865 million if its mergeragreement fell through.   Under the merger pact, Kohlberg agreed to pay $90.05 a share incash and securities for Macmillan's stock.   Maxwell, who is determined to make his company one of theworld's biggest communications concerns, has offered $90.25 in cashfor each of Macmillan's 27.8 million shares provided that, amongother things, the lock-up provision is eliminated.   Maxwell contends the lock-up provision is unfair and would leavethe company with a $250 million tax liability.   He has said he would drop his tender offer if he were allowed tobuy the same four businesses for $900 million. They include theBerlitz language centers, the directory division, the directmarketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes.   The fight for Macmillan has been underway since mid-May when agroup led by the wealthy Texan Robert M. Bass proposed acquiringthe company for $64 a share. The Bass group has since dropped outof the bidding.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan fell 50cents a share to $88.25.</TEXT></DOC>
