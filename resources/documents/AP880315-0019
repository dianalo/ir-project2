(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two hundred arrests were reported Monday asanti-nuclear protesters tried to block buses carrying thousands ofworkers to the nation's nuclear testing grounds.   The protesters slowed traffic into the Nevada Test Site, 65miles northwest of Las Vegas, but failed to halt work, said EnergyDepartment spokesman Chris West.   The majority of those arrested were carried away by officersafter lying down on the main road leading into the sprawling desertsite.   Later, many of those arrested had to be dragged by police offbuses in Tonopah, Nev., about 135 miles away, where they were takento be booked before being released.   ``They weren't going to stand for being driven 135 miles awayand being let loose,'' said protest spokeswoman Trudy Mason.   The Nye County Sheriff's Department said officers decided toremove the protesters from three buses and from the Tonopahconvention center, which was serving as a booking facility, afterthey refused for several hours to be released.   ``They just sat down and went limp and we dragged them out ofthere,'' said Capt. George Gumbmann. Mason claimed some of theprotesters were injured, but Gumbmann said he knew of no injuries.   Monday's arrests followed a demonstration Saturday by up to5,000 people, the largest in more than seven years of protests atthe site. Police arrested 1,240 people that day, mostly onmisdemeanor trespass citations.   A spokesman for the American Peace Test, which is sponsoring thedemonstrations, said 50 protesters had infiltrated the1,350-square-mile site, which is the size of Rhode Island.   West said he was unaware of any such incidents, but said anyinfiltrators would not be able to reach sensitive areas.   American Peace Test estimated there were 200 protesters at thesite Monday, but West said the number was closer to 400.   He said 300 personnel from the Nye County Sheriff's Office, theNevada Highway Patrol and Wackenhut Security remained on duty or onstandby.   The protests are scheduled to continue through Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
