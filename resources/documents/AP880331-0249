Ritalin is commonly prescribed for hyperactive children withattention deficit disorder, but too often they are diagnosedwithout proper testing and evaluation, they say.   And if a treatment does not include counseling and educationaltherapies, it probably is faulty, the experts add.   ``I think there are children given the drug who do not haveADD,'' said Dr. Jerry Wiener, president of the American Academy ofChild and Adolescent Psychiatry. ``And if they do, drugs alone arenot going to resolve that. Very often mistakes are made of makingthe diagnosis and then only prescribing the drug.''   Parents, Wiener said, should expect five things of theirphysician:   _ A complete and thorough diagnosis.   _ Information about possible side effects.   _ Close monitoring of the effects of medication through regularvisits.   _ Information about alternative treatments.   _ An explanation of the consequences if medication is not used.   ``If the physician does not do these things, parents have everyreason ... to seek medical help elsewhere,'' Wiener said.   The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders says an ADD diagnosis mustinclude signs of inattention and impulsivity, as well as onsetbefore age 7 and duration of at least six months. Other disordersmust be ruled out.   An ADD study group appointed by the Georgia Department ofEducation called ADD ``one of the most time-consuming of thedisorders of childhood to evaluate.''   Dr. Michael Levine, a San Antonio, Texas, child hyperactivityexpert, said he spends two hours taking history and 10 hourstesting before making an ADD diagnosis.   ``When you see Johnny staring out the window or bouncing off thewalls, you don't know if he's off-task because of a brain filterproblem (treatable with Ritalin), a learning disability or abehavioral problem,'' Levine said.   Once an ADD diagnosis is made, experts say, too often the childis treated only with medications such as Ritalin _ the prescribedway to go until as recently as 1970. The latest research shows thata more effective treatment combines medication with therapy andcounseling.   ``Everyone agrees that you have to do something more than give apill,'' said Dr. James Satterfield of Encino, Calif., who pioneeredsome ADD research. ``In the real world, most of the children getone treatment, seldom two, never three _ and the most common wouldbe medication.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, April 5</NOTE></DOC>
