And he's not talking moonshine.His barrels are filled with some of the world's finest crudeoil, though there is precious little of it. Following Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait, the lukewarm commodity has turned redhot, with local refineries paying $23 for a 42-gallon barrel,compared with $16.50 in June. Although no one expects a gushof new drilling, already locals talk of bringing back wellsidled since the last oil crisis of the late 1970s.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If it gets up to $25 a barrel, then I guess I'll let itgo,&quot; says the fourth-generation driller of his 80 gallons onhand. &quot;This is the first time I've ever been able to controlmy destiny.&quot;   Nearby, another driller, Thomas Breene, is sitting on1,500 gallons. &quot;I'm not in any hurry to sell it.&quot;   Mr. Breene is just one of dozens of Pennsylvanians tryingto make a living drilling oil. In an industry dominated byExxons and Mobils, the midget oil producers here arestruggling anachronisms. They are often one-person operationsthat own a handful of wells and sell to local refineries.Their owners frequently supplement their incomes withconstruction jobs, contracting oil-field work for out-of-towninvestors or even raising capons. For them, the rise in oilprices means the difference between a tiny profit and a loss,or between operating and abandoning a well.   It's only fitting that a global oil crisis should be soprofoundly felt by independent oil men in northwesternPennsylvania. For it was in this valley that the oil industrywas born in 1859.   That year, Col. Edwin Drake drilled the world's firstcommercial well just outside of Oil City and down the OilCreek in a town called Titusville. Within five years, 900wells dotted the Oil Creek valley. Boom towns with names likePetroleum Centre and Red Hot sprung up and lasted until thewell ran dry -- which in the case of Pit Hole, population15,000, was 500 days. Oil City became the transportation andindustry hub.   Many aspects of the modern oil industry, from pipelines todiamond drills, have their roots here. Local petroleumgeologist Samuel T. Pees argues that a well drilled in themiddle of rocky Oil Creek qualifies as the first offshoredrilling. He points to the &quot;precursor to the ocean-goingtanker&quot;: four-foot-square boats that carried 400 barrels upOil Creek to the Allegheny River and onto Pittsburgh. The OilCreek andamp; Titusville Railroad beckons tourists to take a tripthrough the &quot;Valley that Changed the World.&quot;   But residents lament that most Americans now associate oilwith Texas and J.R. Ewing and northwest Pennsylvania withdeer. Even Oil City natives like Pennzoil Co. movedheadquarters to Texas, where the wells are deeper and the oilcan be sucked up with a straw. The population here is halfits peak of 30,000. A local realtor's &quot;Buy Me&quot; signs are asplentiful as mailboxes, and City Manager Thomas Rockovich issearching for some non-oil related industry to fill an emptysteel plant that made oil pipelines.   The problem with Oil City wells is that they're shallowand old. They don't gush, they dribble, pumping just enoughto fill a Texan's 10-gallon hat. So-called peach-can wellsproduce a tin can's worth -- enough for a lawnmower. Therewas so little money to make that Quaker State Oil Co., whichhas its headquarters here, sold its shallow oil-well businessin 1988.   Local drillers figure they need eight wells to produce abarrel a day, and unless crude oil prices exceed $20, they'repumping red ink -- not black gold. Only when refiners pay $30a barrel does septuagenarian Mr. Preston figure he can builda nest egg and possibly hang up his oil-stained blue workclothes.   So while the rest of the world is cursing the risingcrude-oil price and its impact at the gasoline pump, theindustry's little squirts are quietly counting theirblessings.   &quot;We've had a long dry spell for four years,&quot; says CharlesBaker, sitting outside the Log Cabin restaurant on the hoodof a Buick Riviera and chewing a toothpick. &quot;I hope I'mwrong, but I don't think it will go over $28. I hope it goesto $50. Hell, I hope it goes to $100.&quot;   Although it's not clear exactly what impact rising oilprices will have on the area, few believe Oil City willreturn to its boomtown size. There are new environmentalexpenses on top of production costs that are already amongthe highest in the world because of the shallow, low-yieldwells. Moreover, it costs $25,000 to $30,000 to drill a newwell, and banks are reluctant to loan money in such aboom-bust business, local drillers say.   &quot;The cream is gone. It's so much easier to get itelsewhere,&quot; says Mr. Preston. A tough man who cleans hishands by wiping them on the nearest tree, Mr. Preston stillsqueezes about half a barrel of oil a day out of a900-foot-deep well drilled in the late 1800s. The well runson a 1905 mechanical pump with locomotive-size wheels that hehas to crank to get moving. It's one of only 40 of his 100wells that are operating; he can't afford a crew for the restand budgets based on what he has in his wallet thatafternoon. &quot;People would say we're insane, if you look at theeconomics of it,&quot; he says.   Rising oil prices could make him appear less crazy.Geologist Mr. Pees says the area is still oil-rich and thateach dollar-a-barrel boost may make it feasible to putanother abandoned oil field back into production.   &quot;At $20 a barrel some fields can begin to produce to makea slight profit, and at $23 another field may come on line,and at $25 still more,&quot; he says. City Manager Mr. Rockovichsays that during the last oil crisis, Oil City's VenagoCounty was second in the U.S. in terms of new wells beingdrilled.   That, however, was before strict state environmentallegislation was passed. Driller Mike Perrett thinks the daysof new wells are over, because drillers can't afford the$25,000 bond to drill wells under a state law enacted in themid-1980s. He has a new name for the state's Department ofEnvironmental Regulation: Department of Employment Reduction.   Driller Don Taylor, who raises cattle and capons to makeends meet, says that at the very least, rising prices shouldhelp him repair broken wells that have been too costly tofix. Indeed, Mr. Breene says replacing a stretch of brokenpipe costs $1,000, which could take several years to recoup.&quot;At $12 a barrel, it's not feasible to repair wells. At $25 abarrel, it's something you look at,&quot; he says.   More than anything else, these drillers are looking forstability. Many long-timers have already riddenroller-coaster crude oil prices and fear such acrisis-generated price boost won't last.   &quot;It can go up as fast as go down,&quot; says Wilma Weaver, whoalong with her husband has been in the business for 30 years.&quot;This little bit helps, but who knows how long it will last.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
