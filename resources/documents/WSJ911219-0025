Separately, Dubai's national airline, Emirates, said itsigned a letter of intent to buy as many as 14 Boeing 777jetliners for as much as $2 billion, favoring the newtwo-engine aircraft over offerings from Airbus Industrie andMcDonnell Douglas Corp. And Malaysia Airlines ordered 10Boeing jets in a deal valued at $480 million.</LP><TEXT>   Many of the firm orders in the $3 billion announcementactually were placed earlier but weren't publicly discloseduntil now. The orders weren't added to Boeing's officialbacklog because the carriers had asked that the orders bekept off Boeing's books for a number of reasons.   Analysts are aware that there's always a phantom portionof Boeing's backlog. And the Seattle company often goes backto the airlines and presses them to put their orders on therecord, which some agree to do toward the end of the year.   But the latest effort to package the purchases in asingle, multibillion-dollar announcement -- a step Boeinghasn't taken for at least several years -- underscores justhow much the company wants to get out the message that itsproduction base is solid and that the industry downturn isn'tas severe as some believe.   That's been a tough argument to make, even when put in theperspective that 1990's orders set a record that would betough to match even in a stable economy. Indeed, with theairline industry in the midst of a shakeout and the overalleconomy still sour, many observers are wondering whether jetmakers, who have already disclosed some plans to scale backproduction, eventually will have to curb output even further.   Boeing executives said today's expected announcement is anattempt to reflect accurately just how much business thecompany has. &quot;The real objective here is to tidy things up,to put out numbers that are a realistic appraisal of what theyear was all about,&quot; said Chris Longridge, vice president forsales at Boeing's commercial airplane unit.   Yet Mr. Longridge acknowledged, &quot;If the market takes thisas a positive sign, that's a real benefit.&quot;   As of yesterday, Boeing's firm bookings for the year stoodat 218 airplanes valued at $17.1 billion, compared with 502planes valued at $44.4 billion at the same point in 1990.Today's announcement, Mr. Longridge noted, &quot;will to take usto 250 firm aircraft orders this year, which will put us inexcess of $20 billion.&quot; Boeing, he said, is &quot;pleased to havedone this well in a very, very difficult environment.&quot;   Boeing, with about a $90 billion overall firm backlogthat's equal to more than three years of production, hastried to impress upon Wall Street the need to keep focused onthe long term. That has proven difficult, however. WhenChairman Frank Shrontz earlier this month suggested thatBoeing &quot;could end up with a significant problem&quot; if theeconomy doesn't improve soon, its shares sank more than $3.The next day the executive took the unusual step ofclarifying his remarks in a statement, reiterating that thecompany's production rates are firm for 1992.   Yesterday in late New York Stock Exchange trading, Boeingwas quoted at $42, off 37.5 cents.   Besides the disclosure of previously unannounced orders,some of the bookings to be unveiled today are new orders andothers represent options recently converted to firm status.Specifically, British Airways has bought eight 747-400s andthree 767-300 extended-range models valued at a total of$1.35 billion. Aer Lingus has ordered four 737s valued at$140 million. UAL Corp.'s United Airlines is adding 10767-300ERs valued at about $800 million. Delta Air Lines hasbought four 757s valued at about $200 million. And Qantas haspurchased four 747-400s and one 767-300ER valued at a totalof $600 million.   Meanwhile in Dubai, officials said the letter of intentwas for seven firm orders for delivery in 1996 and 1997, andseven options. A Boeing official said the company hopes tosign a formal contract soon.   The order from Malaysia Airlines, its second of the year,was for eight 737-400s, one 737-300 to be modified as afreighter after delivery, and one 747-400 jumbo jet. The 737swere converted from previously announced options. With thislatest order, the airline added seven 737 options and onemore 747 option.   Separately, Boeing said it notified 562 employees thatthey could be laid off in the next 60 days. Nearly all ofthem work in the Puget Sound area.   A spokesman said the reduction was the result ofdefense-budget cuts. He also cited recently disclosed plansto scale back production on the 737 commercial aircraft line.   The latest announcement, the spokesman said, means thatBoeing has notifed a total of about 1,000 employees that theycould be laid off early next year. He said the jet maker hasa work force of about 158,000.</TEXT></DOC>
