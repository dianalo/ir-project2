OMB set a deadline for commentof February 17, 1989.OMB received 99 letters of comment on the December 1988 notice. 22 percentwere from Members of Congress; 5 percent from Federal agencies; 23 percentfrom State and local governments; 50 percent from the private sector. Thecomplete set of comments is available to the public in OMB's public docketroom: Room 3201, New Executive Office Building, 725 17th St., NW., Washington,DC 20503 (Telephone (202) 395-6880).OMB intends to announce the final MSA standards for the 1990's before April1, 1990.Background: OMB defines metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) as part ofits statistical policy responsibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act(5 USC 1320). The concept of an MSA is an area consisting of a large populationnucleus together with adjacent communities having a high degree of economicand social integration with that nucleus. MSAs are composed of whole counties,except in New England where they are defined by city and town. The currentstandards also specify that an MSA of more than one million populationthat meets certain other specified requirements will be termed a ``ConsolidatedMetropolitan Statistical Area'' (CMSA), consisting of major componentsrecognized as ``Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas'' (PMSAs). In addition,OMB defines New England county metropolitan areas (NECMAs).The MSA standards were first used for the 1950 census and have been reviewedat the time of each decennial census since then. The 1980 MSA standardspublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 956, January 3, 1980) are being reviewednow. OMB intends the 1990 MSA standards to be similar to the 1980 MSA standards,except where we have specifically noted a possible change in the sectionthat follows called ``Summary of Comments.'' After the June 1992 announcementdefining MSAs for the 1990's, based on the 1990 MSA standards and the 1990census results, the determinations will not be reviewed again until afterthe 2000 census, except for selected changes as specified in the sectionon intercensal updating.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments</ITAG>General Comments1. <T3>Issue:</T3> The present terminology is confusing and should be clarified.The term MSA can mean either the whole set of areas defined under the standard,or just those whose label is ``MSA''_those metropolitan areas that arefree-standing and not included in any CMSA.<T3>Response:</T3> OMB is considering using the term ``Metropolitan Areas(MAs)'' as the generic descriptor for the overall system, and using CMSAs,PMSAs, and MSAs to identify different kinds of individual areas.2. <T3>Issue:</T3> A concise statement of the metropolitan area concept isneeded.<T3>Response</T3>: The general concept of a metropolitan area is that ofa geographic area consisting of a large population nucleus together withadjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integrationwith that nucleus. Some areas are defined around two or more nuclei.A standard set of metropolitan areas in the United States is defined bythe Office of Management and Budget as part of its statistical policy responsibilitiesunder the Paperwork Reduction Act.3. <T3>Issue</T3>: State whether the basic concept of an MSA has remainedthe same since 1950.<T3>Response</T3>: The basic concept of an MSA (see Issue 2) has remainedthe same since these areas were first defined for the 1950 census. However,the specific criteria used to define the area's nucleus and to implementother aspects of the basic concept have been adjusted from time to timeto reflect changes that have occurred in national settlement and commutingpatterns, and to maintain definitions that are relatively consistent. Afterthe post-1990 redefinition we intend to address the issue of whether moreextensive changes are needed in the procedures for defining metropolitanareas.4. <T3>Issue</T3>: Provide the official OMB definition, if any, of nonmetropolitanareas.<T3>Response</T3>: OMB is responsible for defining metropolitan areas forFederal statistics. Any territory not included in a metropolitan area isreferred to as nonmetropolitan. Other Federal agencies may classify theterritory outside of metropolitan areas for their own statistical or programpurposes; for example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Departmentof Labor classifies areas outside of MSAs into individual small labor marketareas for purposes of estimating labor force and unemployment.5. <T3>Issue</T3>: Consider returning to a simplier metropolitan classificationsystem.<T3>Response</T3>: A system of CMSA/PMSA/MSA classification will continuefor 1990. The current system was adopted in 1980, following a review ofchanges in the distribution patterns of the population since the inceptionof the formal definitions in 1950, and in response to the data requirementsof an increasingly sophisticated data-using public.6. <T3>Issue</T3>: The MSA standards should emphasize consistency.<T3>Response</T3>: OMB assigns a high priority to maintaining the consistencyof the metropolitan area concept as presented in the standards over thepast 40 years. However, definitional consistency cannot equate to geographicstability. Metropolitan areas are expanded (or contracted, or combined)to reflect growth or change over time.7. <T3>Issue</T3>: Consider alternative methods for determining when MSAs,central cities, or outlying counties should be disqualified, such as:A. Disqualifying areas only after two successive censuses show them failingto meet the required thresholds.B. Adopting lower thresholds for retention than those applicable for initialqualification.C. Eliminate all ``grandfathering'' criteria that retain previously qualifyingareas; delete any area that does not meet the current standards as soonas a decennial census shows that to be the case.<T3>Response</T3>: We will consider this issue before finalizing the standardsfor the 1990's. We welcome comments on these or other alternative approaches.8. <T3>Issue</T3>: OMB should not create new MSAs in one year and then combinethem with others two years later, as occurred in 1981-1983.<T3>Response</T3>: OMB has two options with regard to the announcementof metropolitan areas after the 1990 census data become available:A. OMB can announce certain newly qualifying areas in June 1991 based onthe Census Bureau's 1990 census population counts and using the 1980 censuscommuting data, since 1990 commuting data will not yet be available. Whenmetropolitan area configurations using the 1990 census commuting data areannounced (scheduled for June 1992) the areas announced in 1991 may bemodified. This approach is consistent with the procedure followed afterthe 1980 census and with OMB's established practice of announcing new areasbetween decennial censuses when they reach the prerequisite thresholds.In addition, it will allow for the earlier publication of the decennialcensus data for an expanded set of metropolitan areas. However, it willprobably result in the announcement of a few areas that will lose separaterecognition and become parts of other areas when the 1990 commuting databecome available, as was the case after the 1980 census.B. OMB can wait to announce all redefinitons of metropolitan areas in theUnited States until the complete set of 1990 census data becomes available,scheduled for June 1992. This option provides consistency and avoids announcingsome areas that will probably have only short-term separate recognition.However, it delays the announcement of any areas that have met the requiredthresholds in 1991. It will also limit the number of metropolitan areasfor which statistics appear in the 1990 census publications.We invite comments on which redefinition option OMB should adopt in announcingmetropolitan areas after the 1990 census.9. <T3>Issue</T3>: MSAs should be defined by county in New England as in therest of the country. Alternatively, the New England approach_defining MSAsin terms of subcounty geographic areas_should be adopted nationwide.<T3>Response</T3>: New England MSAs are defined by town (township) andcity rather than by whole county due to significant differences from therest of the country in both administrative functions and settlement patterns.Also, except for New England a wide range of statistics was generally notavailable below the county level when standard metropolitan areas werefirst established at the time of the 1950 census, and this is still thecase. However, OMB does issue a set of metropolitan definitions in termsof whole counties for New England_the New England County Metropolitan Areas(NECMAs)_for data users who wish to use county units.Given the continued need for a county-based system, and the existence ofthe supplemental NECMA classification, OMB intends to maintain the presentstructure.10. <T3>Issue: </T3>There is confusion among the terms ``merged'', ``consolidated'',and ``combined'' as used in defining metropolitan areas under the standards.<T3>Response: </T3>OMB will clarify the meaning of these different termsin the MSA standards. OMB intends to continue using the term ``consolidated''for Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (CMSAs). 11. <T3>Issue: </T3>The percent of population that is urban is an indicatorused to qualify outlying counties of an MSA. If a county is included inan MSA, will it be called ``urban''? <T3>Response: </T3>OMB does not designate counties as ``urban'' or ``rural,''and the Census Bureau definitions of ``urban'' and ``rural'' are not madein terms of counties. Some other Federal agencies have designated countiesas ``urban'' for the purposes of certain specific programs. 12. <T3>Issue: </T3>State (1) the mathematical approach to rounding and precisionof percentages, densities, and ratios in determining qualification, and(2) the sources of the data. <T3>Response: </T3>Percentages, densities, and ratios are expressed tothe nearest tenth (one decimal place) and comparisons between them aremade on that basis. For example, if a commuting interchange is computedat 19.949 percent, it is to be rounded to 19.9 percent; if the percentageis computed as 19.950, it is to be rounded to 20.0 percent. The proposeduse of one decimal place in the 1990 standards replaces the use of twodecimal places in the 1980 standards. The source of the data used in these calculations is the most recent decennialcensus, except in cases of intercensal updating (see Issue 17). 13. <T3>Issue: </T3>Define what is meant by a ``statistical program.'' <T3>Response: </T3>``Statistical program'' means the use in the Federalstatistical system of all resources required to collect, process, and disseminatequantitative information on the economic and social practices and experiencesof the people, businesses, and institutions of the United States. 14. <T3>Issue: </T3>There is no distinction in the standards between statisticaland programmatic uses of MSA data. <T3>Response: </T3>MSAs are defined by OMB as part of its statistical policyresponsibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. OMB BulletinNo. 89-11 states that: ``All agencies that conduct statistical activities to collect and publishdata for MSAs should use the most recent definitions of MSAs establishedby OMB. ``OMB establishes and maintains the definitions of MSAs solely for statisticalpurposes. In periodically reviewing and revising the MSA definitions, OMBdoes not take into account or attempt to anticipate any nonstatisticaluses that may be made of the definitions, nor will OMB modify the definitionsto meet the requirements of any nonstatistical program.'' 15. <T3>Issue: </T3>Indicate how OMB obtains comments from the public. <T3>Response: </T3>OMB solicits comments from the public on the MSA standardsthrough notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. OMB also solicits comments from selected organizationsand persons interested in this subject. Local Opinion 16. <T3>Issue: </T3>Define local opinion and its appropriate sources, and stateits role in the MSA designation process. Expand local opinion to includeviews of the business community as expressed by chambers of commerce, planningcommissions, etc., directly to OMB rather than through the Congressionaldelegation. <T3>Response: </T3>Local opinion is the reflection of the views of thepublic on selected matters related to the application of the standardsfor defining MSAs. In the current MSA standards, local opinion is a factorin: <ITAG tagnum="15">A. Combining two adjacent MSAs whose central cities are within 25miles of each other. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">B. Identification of PMSAs within CMSAs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">C. Titling PMSAs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">D. Titling CMSAs after identification of the largest city. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">E. Assignment of an area that, based on commuting, is eligible forinclusion in more than one area. </ITAG>We believe the appropriate focal point for local opinion is the Congressionaldelegation, consisting of the Senators of the State(s) involved and theUnited States Representatives of the area in question. As part of the 1990area redefinition process, members of the Congressional delegations willbe urged to contact a wide range of groups in their communities, includingbusiness or other leaders, chambers of commerce, planning commissions,and local officials to solicit comments on specified issues. After thethresholds in the statistical standards have been met, all pertinent localopinion material received by OMB on these matters will be considered indetermining the final definition and title of the area. OMB also will considerany pertinent information that it may receive from other sources on thelocal opinion issue being considered. Intercensal Updating 17. <T3>Issue: </T3>Clarify the procedures for intercensal updating of MSAdefinitions, and discuss the possibility of adding outlying counties betweendecennial censuses. Other comments stated that frequent redefinitions arean inconvenience. <T3>Response: </T3>Procedures to update MSA definitions between censuseswill be added to the standards. The scope of intercensal MSA updating isdetermined primarily by data availability. For example, Bureau of the Censuscommuting data have not been available between censuses; therefore, definitionsbased on sections of the standards that rely on commuting data, such asthose qualifying outlying counties and those defining CMSAs and PMSAs,have not been updated between censuses. The following draft for a new section of the MSA standards is publishedfor comment. Section XX. MSA Changes in Definitions Between Censuses <T3>Definitions: </T3>A <T3>Census Count</T3> is a special census conducted by the U.S. Bureauof the Census or a decennial census count updated to reflect annexationsand boundary changes since the census. An <T3>Official Estimate: </T3>is a population estimate issued by the U.S.Bureau of the Census for an intercensal year. A. <T3>Qualification as an MSA. </T3>A potential MSA qualifies for recognitionif:  (1) A city reaches 50,000 population according to a Census Count or OfficialEstimate.  (2) A nonmetropolitan county containing an urbanized area (UA) definedby the Bureau of the Census at the most recent decennial census reaches100,000 population according to a Census Count or Official Estimate. Ifthe potential MSA centered on the UA consists of two or more counties,their total population must reach 100,000. In New England, the cities andtowns qualifying for the potential MSA must reach a total population of75,000.  (3) The Census Bureau defines a new UA based on a Census Count after thedecennial census, and the potential MSA containing the UA meets the populationrequirements of Section XX. A(2).  If an MSA is qualified intercensally, the qualification of the MSA mustbe confirmed by the next decennial census, or the area is disqualified. B. <T3>Addition of counties. </T3>As a general rule, counties are not addedto MSAs between censuses. The only exceptions are:  (1) If a qualified central city extends into a county not included in theMSA and the population of the portion of the city in the county reaches2,500 according to a Census Count, then the county qualifies as a centralcounty and is added to the MSA.  (2) If an MSA qualified intercensally under Section XX. A meets the requirementsof section 6 of the standards for combination with an MSA already recognized,that combination may take place and thereby alter the definition of theexisting MSA.  C. <T3>Qualification as a central city. </T3>A Census Count serves to qualifya central city (Section 4) which has failed to qualify solely because itspopulation was smaller than required_for example, it did <T3>not </T3>qualify as the largest city in the MSA (Section 4A), or wasbelow 250,000 (4B), below 25,000 (4C), or below 15,000 (4D). If qualificationrequires comparison with the population of another city, comparison ismade with the latest available Official Estimate or Census Count of thepopulation of the other city.  D. <T3>Area titles. </T3>The title of an MSA, PMSA, or CMSA may be alteredto include the name of a place that has newly qualified as a central cityon the basis described in Section XX. C, and that also meets the requirementsof Section 8. Such a change is made by adding the new name at the end ofthe existing title, but cannot be made if the title already contains threenames. Names in area titles are not resequenced except on the basis ofa decennial census.  E. Other aspects of the MSA standard are not subject to change betweendecennial censuses.''  MSA Qualification and Outlying County Qualification  18. <T3>Issue: </T3>Revise the minimum population size for MSA qualification. A. Raise the minimum qualifying population size from 50,000 to 100,000for all MSAs.  B. Waive the 100,000 minimum qualifying population size if two or morecontiguous cities equal or exceed 50,000 population.  <T3>Response: </T3>The current criterion qualifies a metropolitan areaif it contains an incorporated city of 50,000 or more, regardless of thearea's total population. This criterion has been used since the metropolitanarea system was first adopted for the 1950 census. when additional areaswere recognized after 1980 on the basis of urbanized areas populationsof 50,000 or more, regardless of the size of the largest city, a criterionwas added to require at least 100,000 total area population in such cases.This population may be the total of one or more counties. We proposed tomaintain these criteria for 1990.  The proposal to accept two contiguous cities that exceed 50,000 parallelsa provision that was part of the metropolitan area criteria from 1958 to1971. A somewhat similar provision was in effect from 1971 to 1980. Allsuch provisions in the standards represent attempts to identify the populationnucleus around which a metropolitan area is to be defined (see Issues 2and 3). Over time, the standards have moved away from making this identificationin terms of corporate city areas and towards a definition in terms of theextent of urban development. This is because the pre-1980 criteria basedon two or more contiguous cities or places often produced inconsistentresults, since cities in some States have annexed extensively and are contiguousto others some distance away, while in other States city areas are small.The current criteria provide a much more standard treatment based on urbanizedareas, whose boundaries to a large extent do not observe corporate limits.Therefore, the current criteria will not be changed for 1990.  19. <T3>Issue: </T3>A county that meets the existing commuting standards througha combined commuting rate to two or more MSAs should be qualified as anoutlying country, even if it does not have qualifying commuting to anyMSA individually.      <T3>Response: </T3>The general concept of an MSA reflected in the standardsis that of a geographic area consisting of a large population nucleus togetherwith adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration,as measured by commuting to the nucleus of the MSA. It would not be consistentwith this concept to accept commuting to two or more separate MSAs.20. <T3>Issue: </T3>Change the qualification requirements for including outlyingcountries in MSAs.A. Tighten the requires_for example:(1) Require counties with 15 to 25 percent of their workers commuting toqualify on all four measures of metropolitan character in Sec. 3A(4), insteadof two, and increase the 60 persons per square mile density requirementto 100 per square mile.(2) Require outlying counties to be at least 50 percent urban, have atleast 30 percent commuting, have some urbanized area, and have a minimumpopulation density of 150 persons per square mile.B. Loosen the requirements_for example:(1) For an MSA with a central city more than 100 miles from any other centralcity, allow a county to qualify if it has at least 10 percent commuting,provided there is at least 15 percent commuting from its largest city,population density is at least 60 per square mile, the urban percentageis at least 50, and population grew by at least 20 percent in the pastintercensal period or 40 percent over the past two intercensal periods.This change is called for because the unusually large size of many countiesin the West makes population density an inappropriate measure.(2) Include counties in an MSA based on media penetration, for examplenewspaper circulation.<T3>Response: </T3>The current standards for qualifying outlying countiesestablish specific criteria of metropolitan character, and require countiesto meet specified combinations of these, with less restrictive requirementsfor countries with relatively high rates of commuting. Counties may qualifyon the basis of alternative combinations of the criteria (for example,by meeting two out of four specified requirements) because this appearsto produce metropolitan definitions that are more consistent from regionto region. Requiring outlying counties to meet all these indicators woulddisqualify a large share of those now qualified and would present a sharpbreak with past practice.OMB must consider the appropriateness of any proposed criterion for a nationallyapplicable standard. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to adopt individualizedrules lacking national applicability. A rule based on distance from otherMSA central cities would be hard to maintain as additional cities reachmetropolitan size. Newspaper circulation data are unsatisfactory for definingmetropolitan areas because many metropolitan newspapers also circulateextensively to rural counties and small cities that lie beyond the actualmetropolitan area.<T3>Issue: </T3>Base commuting interchange rates on full-time employeesonly. The increase of part-time workers in the labor force may alter previouscommuting patterns.<T3>Response: </T3>The number of part-time workers has increased both inthe 1970's and the 1980's. However, the effect of this increase on commutingrates needs further study, which we plan to undertake after 1990 censusdata are available. (See also Issue 3)22. <T3>Issue: </T3>Exclude military base personnel from the computation ofjob commuting rates.<T3>Response: </T3>Resident military personnel are considered a part ofthe area's population and labor force and should not be treated separatelyin the calculations.23. <T3>Issue: </T3>Exclude from the population density calculations areasunsuitable for habitation, such as national forests, reservoirs, wetlands,military test sites, and the like.<T3>Response: </T3>Such areas are part of the county. In many instancessuch landholdings surround or border settlements of people who depend onthem for employment and who might otherwise not live in the area.Central Cities24. <T3>Issue: </T3>Central cities are not adequately identified by commutingand minimum population standards. These standards should be waived or modified,particularly for previously qualified central cities.<T3>Response: </T3>In the 1980 MSA standards, OMB specified two commutingrequirements as a means of more clearly identifying which cities were functioningas centers of metropolitan areas. OMB believes population size, combinedwith the commuting standards, can continue to provide a valid basis fordetermining which cities are functioning as central cities. (See Issue7)25. <T3>Issue: </T3>Do not delete central cities with urban stress conditionsor with high minority populations. Consider cultural and social dominanceas well as (or in lieu of) other factors. Add tests on population densityor percent minority population to the criteria to determine central cities.<T3>Response: </T3>Central cities are defined in terms of population sizeand commuting standards. Urban stress or high minority populations arenot unique to central cities of metropolitan areas. The revision of the1990 standards will not modify the qualification requirements with respectto these issues. (Also see Issue 3) 26. <T3>Issue: </T3>Retain all previously qualified central cities when MSAsmerge. <T3>Response: </T3>When MSAs meet the criteria for merger, a city thatwas large enough for central city status in the previous MSA may not meetthe required 25,000 or one-third population size to be a central city inthe larger area, even though it may continue to meet the commuting requirements.The purpose of the standards is to provide a current depiction of eachmetropolitan area and the most prominent cities in the enlarged area. Itis not appropriate to retain central cities simply because they were previouslyqualified. However, we will review whether it might be appropriate to establishdifferent thresholds for qualification and for disqualification (also seeIssue 7). 27. <T3>Issue: </T3>Consider qualifying as MSAs areas that meet the standardsalthough lacking an incorporated central city. <T3>Response: </T3>The Census Bureau is proposing to change its 1990 urbanizedarea (UA) criteria to permit delineation of UAs without incorporated places;the main population cluster would then be called the ``central place''of the UA rather than ``central city''. Towns in New England (and townsand townships in other States where such units may have municipal-typefunctions) are eligible under the existing MSA standards for central citystatus under Section 4 if their population is essentially all urban. Assumingthis change in the UA criteria becomes effective, OMB may designate oneor more MSAs with no incorporated city, but with a central community ofthis type. We welcome comments as to whether the ``central city'' in suchan area should be the entire town or township, or only the core community.In the unlikely event of a UA qualifying in a State where there are nogovernmentally functioning county subdivisions (towns or townships), the``central place'' would be only the core unincorporated community. 28. <T3>Issue: </T3>Central cities should be classified into ``principal''and ``outlying.'' <T3>Response: </T3>OMB does not plan to make this change. Central citieswill remain a single category for the MSA standards of the 1990's. (Alsosee Issue 3) 29. <T3>Issue: </T3>A PMSA should have a single central city if there is avery large population difference (for example, two million or more) betweenthe largest and second largest qualifying cities. <T3>Response: </T3>If a minimum population criterion has been met (in thestandards, generally 25,000), a city may have strong enough centralityas measured by the requirements of Section 4C of the MSA standards to bedesignated as central. (Also see Issue 3) Titles 30. <T3>Issue: </T3>State how area titles are determined under the currentstandards, and whether city and county names can be reflected in the sametitle. <T3>Response: </T3>Area titles should be indicative of the major communitiesof the area, preferably the central city(ies), and be recognizable to theuser. To be included in a title, a city must qualify as a central cityunder the MSA standards. There may be up to three names in a title. MSAtitles use only city names. PMSA titles may use city names or county names since some PMSAs do notinclude a qualifying central city. However, in order to avoid ambiguity,OMB will not combine the names of both cities and counties in a singlePMSA title. Local opinion is a factor in determining PMSA titles. Under the current standards, CMSA titles begin with the name of the CMSA'slargest central city. This is generally followed by the first city nameappearing in the title of each of the next two largest PMSAs. A regionaldesignation may be substituted for the second and/or third name in a titleif there is strong local support and the proposed designation is suitableand unambiguous. Local opinion is a factor in determining CMSA titles.31. <T3>Issue: </T3>State whether a city must be a CMSA central city in orderto be in a PMSA title. <T3>Response: </T3>The central city concept is integral to the MSA concept;a city must qualify under the standards as central if its name is to appearin any area title. 32. <T3>Issue: </T3>Specify proposed changes in the titling of MSAs. <T3>Response: </T3>OMB is considering changing section 8A(1) of the existingstandards to base secondary central cities in titles on population only(deleting the reference to work force); and also is considering replacingsection 8A(3) with a provision that would allow local opinion to add asecond or third central city to the title, even if that city does not meetthe one-third population requirement. Section 8 on Titles of Metropolitan Statistical Areas would read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">A. The title of a metropolitan statistical area assigned to LevelB, C, and D includes the name of the largest central city, and up to twoadditional names:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The name of each additional city with a population of at least250,000;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The names of additional cities qualified as central cities bySection 4, provided each is at least one-third as large as the largestcentral city;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The names of other central cities (up to the maximum of two additionalnames) if local opinion supports the resulting title.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. An area title that includes the names of more than one city beginswith the name of the largest city and lists the other cities in order oftheir population according to the most recent national census.*<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>* If a city qualifies as a central city under Section 4, andis included in an existing metropolitan statistical area title, it willnot be resequenced in or displaced from that title until both its populationand the number of persons working within its limits are exceeded by thoseof another city qualifying for the area title.<ITAG tagnum="21">C. In addition to city names, the title contains the name of eachState in which the metropolitan statistical area is located.</ITAG>OMB welcomes comments on this proposal.33. <T3>Issue:</T3> Changes in titles and Federal Information Processing Standards(FIPS) codes cause problems for users, especially for those making historicaldata comparisons.<T3>Response:</T3> Changes in the initial name in MSA titles are infrequent.Under the present standards, if a city qualifies as a central city andis included in an existing metropolitan statistical area title, it willnot be resequenced in or displaced from that title until both its population<T3>and</T3> the number of persons working within its limits are exceededby those of another city qualifying for the area title.However, title changes may occur from time to time. If the initial namein a title changes, the FIPS code will be changed to reflect the positionof the new title in the alphabet.CMSA/PMSA34. <T3>Issue:</T3> Change the required level of commuting interchange betweenadjacent MSAs for consolidation of the areas.A. Tighten requirements_for example:(1) Require evidence of a higher order of economic relationships beforequalifying areas as consolidated.(2) Do not allow consolidation unless there is at least 15 percent interchange;allowing 10 percent interchange to qualify if urbanized areas are contiguousis unsatisfactory in more densely populated areas.B. Loosen requirements_for example:(1) Allow a specified amount of interchange, such as 100,000, to qualifyinstead of requiring a specified percentage; consider requiring differentbase amounts depending on the population of the areas.(2) Allow consolidation if there is an interchange of at least 10 percent.<T3>Response:</T3> The current standards for consolidation require a commutinginterchange (the total of workers who live in either of the areas but workin the other) of at least 15 percent of the number of workers living inthe smaller of the two areas. If the central cities are located in thesame urbanized area, or if the urbanized areas are contiguous, a commutinginterchange of 10 percent is sufficient for consolidation. These standardshave worked satisfactorily and will be continued.OMB will continue to use percentages rather than absolute amounts of commutingfor qualification because they provide comparability for areas of varyingpopulation size.35. <T3>Issue:</T3> State what limits exist, if any, on the number and geographicextent of MSA mergers and consolidations into ``super areas.''<T3>Response:</T3> The procedures used for the consolidation of MSAs generallypreclude the designation of ``chains'' of areas as CMSAs (for example,from Boston to Washington). Further, any case in which such a chain mightemerge would be subject to special review. All current CMSAs are focusedeither on a single dominant nucleus or on a pair of nuclei.36. <T3>Issue:</T3> Define central counties on the basis of a single urbanizedarea and do not reflect other urbanized areas that may be nearby.<T3>Response:</T3> Central counties are defined in the standards as thebasis for determining the area to which commuting from outlying countiesis measured. Any separate urbanized area may give rise to a separate MSA,but once the county containing such an urbanized area has commuting tieswith the central county of another area sufficient for it to qualify underthe outlying county requirements, the two become merged as a single MSAwith two central counties. This ensures that any outlying county with qualifyingcommuting to either of the central counties or to the two central countiescombined will qualify for the enlarged MSA.37. <T3>Issue: </T3>Raise from 60 to 75 the percent urban requirement for acounty to be considered for forming a new PMSA.<T3>Response:</T3> The percent urban requirement for designating PMSAsis the same as for consolidating adjacent MSAs. When consolidated statisticalareas were established in 1975, a 75 percent urban population was a prerequisite.This figure was lowered to 60 percent in the 1980 standards after a detailedinspection indicated that this would be a more realistic figure. The 60percent criterion standard will be retained for 1990.38. <T3>Issue: </T3>In the criteria for qualifying as a core county of a PMSA(Sec. 9 of the standards), requiring less than 35 percent of a county'sworkers to work outside the county is too low; this cutoff should be raisedto 50 percent.<T3>Response:</T3> The cutoff in the present PMSA standards will be maintainedin the 1990 MSA standards.39. <T3>Issue: </T3>When an interim MSA adjoins more than one potential CMSA,give preference to including it with an area in its own State.<T3>Response:</T3> The MSA standards for determining when adjacent areasshould be consolidated (Section 5) are designed to treat such situationsconsistently and give chief emphasis to the relative commuting ties betweenthe areas.40. <T3>Issue: </T3>State whether the presence of a small part of a centralcity in a county precludes that county from separate PMSA status.<T3>Response:</T3> For PMSAs other than the one containing the largestcentral city, the 1980 MSA standards include a criterion that a countymay not contain any part of the largest central city of the Level A MSA.We propose to maintain this criterion in the 1990 standards.41. <T3>Issue: </T3>Change the rules for sequencing central city names in aCMSA title so that the largest central city of the largest PMSA is thefirst name.<T3>Response:</T3> The current standards require the designation of thecity with the largest population in the CMSA as the first city in the CMSAtitle and we propose to maintain this criterion in the 1990 MSA standards.42. <T3>Issue: </T3>Indicate whether the identification and definition of PMSAsare reviewed every decade by OMB, and whether CMSA/PMSA configurationswill be reviewed by the appropriate Congresional delegation before announcingredefinitions after the 1990 census.<T3>Response:</T3> All MSAs with a population of at least one million (LevelA MSAs) will be reviewed by OMB to determine whether two or more PMSAscan be identified according to the standards. This review will includeexisting as well as potential new areas. In areas where PMSAs could qualify,OMB will write to the appropriate Congressional delegation to obtain localopinion as part of the review of possible PMSA configurations. After OMBhas considered local opinion and made a decision on a particular matter,local opinion on the same question will not be considered again until afterthe next decennial census.43. <T3>Issue: </T3>Do not break up CMSAs into PMSAs unless the expressed localopinion to do so is broadly based.<T3>Response:</T3> After MSAs are defined, they are classified based ontotal population. MSAs of one million or more are categorized as LevelA and are reviewed to see if they contain any areas that could qualifyas PMSAs. Local opinion is sought before any PMSAs are qualified; thislocal opinion should be broadly based and is obtained through the Congressionaldelegation. If no PMSAs are designated, the area remains an MSA.Availability of Revised MSA Standards44. <T3>Issue: </T3>Send copies of the revised MSA standards, when available,to the parties that provided comments based on the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.<T3>Response:</T3> OMB will publish the revised MSA standards in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> by April 1, 1990, and will make copies availableto individual parties that request them. OMB will send copies of the presentNotice to persons that commented.<ITAG tagnum="6">James B.
