The probe is based on a body having a central chamber passing from a first      end of the body to a second end. One end of the central chamber is      connected to a sampling tube to be inserted into a stack and the opposite      end of the body has a port which is adapted to be selectively connected to      a source of calibration gas or blowback gas. A filter divides the central      chamber into an inlet portion and an outlet portion, with the sampling      tube and port connected to the inlet portion. The probe further comprises      a dilution eductor joined to the body, for mixing filtered stack gas with      dilution gas and comprising an inlet for dilution gas, an outlet for      diluted gas and a vacuum cavity therebetween. A sample passage within the      body connects the outlet portion of the chamber to the vacuum cavity and a      heating means encloses the body and eductor. The probe allows more      accurate calibration of the gas analysis, since the calibration gas      follows in the same path as the stack gas. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to an apparatus for measuring the gaseous content of      industrial process gas streams, in a process in which a portion of the gas      stream is extracted, conditioned for analysis and transported to a gas      analysis device. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Due to more stringent Government regulations requiring that continuous      emission monitoring systems demonstrate up-times approaching 100% in some      cases, and the trend to require ever smaller operations to continuously      monitor their gaseous emissions, a clear need exists for a highly reliable      sampling and analysis system that will not cause an unreasonable financial      burden on the smaller regulated operations. </PAR><PAR>  Many gas analysis systems are not specific to one gas, so that gases other      than the gas or gases of interest may cause an erroneous response in the      analysis system. Dilution of the process gas stream with air to achieve      lower concentrations of the interfering gas has been demonstrated as a      reliable way to eliminate many interference problems. </PAR><PAR>  One of the difficulties encountered in the certification process for      continuous emissions monitoring systems is to obtain agreement between the      system being certified and an independent reference monitoring system.      Reference methods suggest frequent installation of clean gas filters,      i.e., between 3 hour sample runs, to insure accurate results. However, it      has been required by regulation that a continuous emission monitoring      system operate for an extended period of time of at least 168 hours      without unscheduled maintenance and provide accurate readings throughout      the extended period. A continuous emission monitoring system can overcome      this handicap by frequent calibration, injecting a known calibration gas      through the same sample flow path as the process gas being measured, and      correcting, either automatically or manually, for any gas loss across the      sample filters and other sampling system components. However, no dilution      probe currently used in the art allows for calibration through all of the      filters in the sample flow path, and thus cannot account for the condition      of the filters. The existing systems utilize a coarse or primary stack gas      filter and a second or fine filter, and while these systems calibrate      through the second filter, they do not calibrate through the coarse or      primary filter. </PAR><PAR>  A typical dilution probe 10 is shown in FIG. 1. All of the system      components are contained inside a stainless steel pipe 12 which is      inserted through stack wall 14 into the process environment. The dilution      probe includes a coarse filter 16, a restrictor plate 18, a fine filter      20, a glass orifice 22, and an eductor assembly 24, all subject to process      temperature extremes between 35.degree. and 580.degree. F. The apparatus      operates with dilution air entering through port 26 producing a diluted      gas stream 28 exiting the apparatus through port 30. Calibration gas      enters the apparatus through port 32. </PAR><PAR>  The flow stability of the critical components and the ultimate dilution      ratio stability are extremely difficult to control under widely changing      process conditions. Attempts have been made to control the temperature of      the probe body to reduce the effects of changing process temperatures, but      have met with limited success due to the wide range of possible      temperatures in the highly corrosive environments of the process streams. </PAR><PAR>  A further problem with the existing technology is the inability to      calibrate through the first or coarse filter 16. Although this filter      consists only of a stainless steel screen, in most cases substantial loss      may be caused by this filter if the filter is allowed to become wet or      partially plugged with a reactive particulate from the process. </PAR><PAR>  This dilution probe is calibrated with calibration gas entering through      port 32, and being pulled through the fine filter 20 into glass orifice      22, and then through dilution eductor 24. Restriction plate 18 is required      to prevent the calibration gas from simply passing into the process      stream; instead, the process gas flow is blocked and 100% calibration gas      is provided to the inlet of the fine filter during calibration. However,      any losses associated with filter screen 9 are not compensated during      calibration, and while adequate for some of the cleaner processes, this      technique is not acceptable for applications that have lower process      temperatures or high moisture conditions usually associated with wet      scrubbing pollution control systems. </PAR><PAR>  Due to the configuration utilized in the existing dilution probe systems,      blowback of the coarse filter element is also a problem. To clean the      filter screen requires a rather explosive air burst, and given the      restriction inherent in the present design, attempts to blowback the      coarse filter have been difficult to accomplish. </PAR><PAR>  Placement of the dilution eductor filtering system inside the stack is      highly undesirable, since most processes attempt to operate above the acid      dew point, i.e., above 300.degree. F., and many processes operate at      temperatures between 280.degree. F. and 1200.degree. F. The prior art      dilution probe shown in FIG. 1 cannot be used at temperatures above      580.degree. F. Extracting a four to eight foot stainless steel tube that      weighs as much as 25 pounds from a process duct at a temperature of      580.degree. F. is not an east or safe maintenance procedure. Maintenance      cannot be performed on the sampling system until the assembly nears      ambient temperature and this may take several hours. Continuous emission      monitoring systems that are required to obtain greater than 95% up-time      could exceed the allowable down time requirements if any maintenance to      the sampling system is required. </PAR><PAR>  A dilution probe to be located primarily outside the stack is disclosed in      U.S. Pat. No. 4,974,455. This probe includes a filter and associated      heater located adjacent to the gas entrance port and an eductor and      associated heater located adjacent to the sample exit port. The heaters      are necessary to maintain the gas above its dew point as it passes through      the apparatus. However, calibration of this apparatus is accomplished much      in the same manner as in the previous apparatus, with a calibration gas      introduced under pressure into the housing, forcing gas out through the      coarse filter and back into the stack. In this process, the entire housing      is purged of sample gas. Like the previous apparatus, this apparatus does      not allow calibration through the coarse filter so that any gas lost      through the coarse filter would not be measured. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a dilution probe to      be located primarily outside the gas stack. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the invention to provide a dilution probe in which      calibration gas follows the same flow path as stack gas in order to more      accurately calibrate the analysis system. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the invention to provide a dilution probe in which      the coarse filter may be easily and properly cleaned by blowback into the      stack. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the invention to provide a gas sampling and      analysis system that allows accurate and interference free measurement of      process gas streams while satisfying all requirements of the Environmental      Protection Agency. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of the invention to provide a process gas sampling      and analysis system which provides a diluted gas sample to a gas analysis      device and greatly simplifies the sampling system maintenance procedures      while achieving a higher level of system performance with regard to      dilution ratio precision and long term system drift. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects of the invention may be achieved through a inertial      filtration dilution probe comprising a body having a central chamber      passing from a first end of the body to a second end and a sampling tube      having one end connected to the central chamber through its first end and      having an opposite end adapted to be inserted into a process stack. The      second end of the body has a port which is adapted to be selectively      connected to a source of calibration gas or blowback gas. </PAR><PAR>  A filter is located in the central chamber and divides the central chamber      into an inlet portion and an outlet portion, with the sampling tube and      the port for gas connected to the inlet portion. </PAR><PAR>  The probe also includes a dilution eductor for mixing filtered stack gas      with dilution gas and which comprises an inlet for the dilution gas, an      outlet for diluted gas and a vacuum cavity therebetween. A sample passage      connects the outlet portion of the central chamber to the vacuum cavity      and includes a restriction orifice. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, the probe comprises heating means enclosing both the body and the      eductor. </PAR><PAR>  By placing the critical components of the probe outside the stack      environment, a wider range of process temperatures mat be tolerated, and      the body, filter, and eductor mat be fabricated of lower temperature and      highly inert materials such as fluoropolymers, polysulfones and      polyamide-imides. Using these materials greatly reduces the possibility of      unwanted gas reactions with sampling system components and provides much      greater accuracy and stability in difficult or extremely corrosive      applications. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, the filter element, critical orifice and eductor may be serviced      without removing the probe from the stack, and probe maintenance may      therefore be accomplished in minutes instead of hours. In fact, the probe      may be cleaned in place, if necessary, by passing a rod of suitable size      through the probe into the process stack. </PAR><PAR>  Utilization of the probe therefore allows a process for extracting a gas      sample for analysis from a process stream including the steps of      extracting a gas sample from the stream without a primary filter at the      probe tip, filtering the gas sample through a heated filter, drawing a      predetermined quantity of filtered gas using a precision non-metallic      dilution eductor that provides sample transport and dilution within a      close coupled assembly and precisely controlled temperature, and passing      the diluted sample to an analysis device. </PAR><PAR>  The dilution probe of the invention has been developed to provide a lower      cost, highly reliable alternative to existing sampling systems. The probe      extracts a very small sample of the process stream, with a flow rate less      than 1 liter per minute, and preferably 50 to 300 ml per minute. Due to      the low flow rate, no filters are required in the sampling probe, with a      large fraction of the particulate matter in the process gas settling out      on the probe walls and being easily removed by blowback with air or steam.      The sampling probe is typically a section of pipe approximately 0.670      inches outer diameter and 0.50 inches inner diameter, and formed of a      material selected for compatibility with a process stream. Suggested      materials for the probe include 316 stainless steel, Hastelloy C-276,      Hastelloy C-276 with a Teflon liner, ceramic or rigid Teflon pipe.      However, any material that is found compatible and non-reactive with the      process stream may be used. </PAR><PAR>  Response time requirements have been met with the probe of the invention by      diluting the extracted gas from the probe immediately after passing      through the heated filter. The low flow rate from the probe can be diluted      with a wide range of air flows to meet response time and sensitivity      requirements of a remote or local analysis system. Typical flow rates to      an external analysis system are in the range of 5 to 15 liters per minute      and give analytical instrument response time of 5 seconds to 3 minutes,      depending upon the application. This response is adequate for most process      control and environmental monitoring requirements. </PAR><PAR>  Dilution of the process stream immediately at the sample source, with dry      instrument air (-40.degree. F. dew point), allows a further simplification      of the gas conditioning system. Permeation dryers, heated sample lines,      gas heat exchangers and mechanical sample pumps are not required.      Moreover, the dew point of the gas stream leaving the probe is largely a      function of the dew point of the dilution air, due to the high dilution      ratio of process gas to dilution air. Dilution ratios of 16:1 to 300:1 are      easily achieved, and yield exit sample dew points at 0.degree. to      -35.degree. F., allowing use of unheated sample lines in all but the most      extreme of environments. Dilution ratios of 10,000:1 or greater may also      be accomplished with additional eductor stages. </PAR><PAR>  The stack sample is pulled from the process stack using a precision low      flow eductor. This eductor is driven by instrument quality air, and the      same air that drives the eductor also dilutes the stack gas that is pulled      in. The eductor assembly is incorporated into the body of the probe, with      a precision orifice positioned at the inlet port to the eductor. An      orifice protection filter may also be incorporated into the sample line      between the filter and the eductor to protect the orifice during      maintenance operations. </PAR><PAR>  The diluted stack sample gas at the exhaust port of the eductor is allowed      to pass through a sample manifold to a vent. A sample transport system,      either local or remote, may then be used to extract diluted sample gas      from the sample manifold for transport to the gas analysis system. </PAR><PAR>  The probe of the invention may be utilized in connection with a local gas      analysis system, in which case the probe and the gas analyzer would be      located in a single enclosure, possibly 30 inches high by 24 inches wide      by 8 inches deep. </PAR><PAR>  The probe may also be used in conjunction with a remote analyzer, in which      case the probe enclosure will be smaller, such as 20 inches high by 16      inches wide by 8 inches deep. In either case, a fiberglass or stainless      steel enclosure is usually used but any construction found to be suitable      for the ambient conditions at the sampling point is acceptable. </PAR><PAR>  The probe generally uses at least a 2.5 inch standard pipe flange for      sampling, but the enclosure may also be fitted with a 4 inch or 6 inch      flange to suit existing sampling ports. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a longitudinal cross-section of a prior art dilution probe; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a longitudinal cross-section of a dilution probe according to the      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a sampling and analysis system with remote      analyzer; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of a sampling and analysis system with local      analyzer. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Shown in FIG. 2 is a probe 40 according to the invention inserted through a      stack wall 38 to which it is secured by mounting flange 43. The probe      includes a probe tip 41 inserted through the stack wall, the probe tip      providing a path for the gas to a chamber 44 in probe body 42. Located in      chamber 44 is a cylindrical filter 46, filter element 46 selected for its      inertness to the process gas. This is usually a glass fiber element with      Teflon binder having a filter rating of 0.1 .mu.m. The opposite end of the      body includes a filter cap 48 sealed with an O-ring 49. The filter element      may be removed and replaced by removing filter cap 48. </PAR><PAR>  Filter cap 48 includes a port 50 therein for introducing calibration and      blowback gas. The body 42 is generally fabricated from Teflon to minimize      sample loss due to unwarranted reactions of the process gas with the body. </PAR><PAR>  On the opposite, downstream side of the filter there is a machined passage      52 having a filter 54 and critical orifice 56 located within. Filter 54 is      a glass wool filter provided to protect the critical orifice assembly      during maintenance to filter 46. While filter 54 normally does not require      maintenance, the filter may be removed and replaced by removing screw      closure 57 from machined passage 52. </PAR><PAR>  The critical orifice assembly 56 may be fabricated from glass, sapphire or      stainless steel. The current design uses a Lee Visco Jet orifice of      stainless steel construction, consisting of a number of series/parallel      jets that are contained in a housing 0.187 inches in diameter and between      0.66 and 0.72 inches of length, depending upon the desired restriction.      The Lee Visco Jet allows for restriction with an orifice diameter as much      as 25 times larger than a single hole orifice. </PAR><PAR>  On the downstream side of the critical orifice there is a machined passage      58 passing into vacuum chamber 62 of eductor 60. The dilution eductor 60      is fabricated from Torlon 4203, a polyamide-imide high temperature resin      with excellent resistance to chemical attack and excellent structural      characteristics at elevated temperatures. Torlon thus offers the inertness      of Teflon with the mechanical stability of metals. </PAR><PAR>  The eductor 60 includes a jet 64 and body 66, all formed of Torlon. The      vacuum generated by the eductor must be greater than 15 inches of mercury      to assure a stable and accurate flow rate through vacuum chamber 62. The      eductor also includes an input 68 for a source of dilution gas and an      output 70 for diluted process gas. </PAR><PAR>  The probe body including the eductor is inserted within an aluminum heater      body 72 with extension 74 to enclose the eductor. The Teflon filter body      42 is pressed into the aluminum heater body 72, which regulates the      temperature of the probe body to approximately 300.degree. F. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows the application of dilution probe 40 in conjunction with a gas      analysis system with remote analyzer. The probe 40 is located in a heated      enclosure 80, with enclosure temperature only roughly controlled to      prevent freezing of enclosure components and provide increased stability.      Process gas enters at the tip of probe 41, moving down the probe at a low      flow rate of 10-300 ml per minute. Much of the large particulate drops out      on the probe walls due to the low sample velocity. From probe 41, gas      enters the analysis enclosure 80 and passes through the heated filter 46. </PAR><PAR>  A regulated source of instrument air 82 is connected to the      dilution/eductor jet 60 through an air pressure regulator 84 and a      pressure gauge 86. The pressure regulator is a precision regulator that      regulates the air pressure to within 0.03 PSI for a 10 PSIG change in      input pressure. The air supply quality and pressure are important and the      flow through eductor 60 not only creates the vacuum that moves the process      gas through the probe system, but also is the dilution air used to dilute      the process gas to lower concentrations. The process gas air flow rate is      set and controlled by the critical orifice 56, while the air flow rate      through eductor 60 may be set by varying the jet which is part of the      eductor. Flow rates between 5 and 15 liters per minute may be selected in      combination with different critical orifices 56, having flow rates between      50 and 300 ml per minute, to yield dilution ratios between 16:1 and 300:1.      Dilution air, passing through line 88, and process gas meet in vacuum      chamber 62 and the diluted process gas exits the eductor assembly through      port 70. From the dilution eductor exhaust port, the diluted process gas      passes through line 90 to a vent bulkhead 92 on the probe enclosure. A      portion of the diluted sample is pulled through another line 93 and port      94 by sample transport pumps 98 and 102, through an unheated Teflon sample      line 95, orifice protection filter 96 and orifice 97. A bypass vent 99 is      provided after sample transport pump 98 in order to establish a reasonable      transport time (usually less than 20 seconds) and may also be connected to      a further analyzer. A portion of the flow is also passed through an      orifice protection filter 100 and a flow control orifice 101 and is pumped      to analyzer 103. Flow control orifice 101 is selected to obtain a desired      flow rate to the remote analyzer 103. From the remote analyzer, diluted      process gas flows to a vent manifold 104. </PAR><PAR>  The probe is cleaned periodically by introducing high pressure blowback air      from port 82 through blowback solenoid valve 106 and port 108 into the      filter body and exiting into the process through probe 40. Solenoid valve      106 mat be operated either automatically or manually. The preferred method      is to automatically energize solenoid valve 106 with either a local timer      or remote controller. Blowback times may vary between 15 minutes for the      most extreme applications and several hours for cleaner applications. </PAR><PAR>  The probe assembly is calibrated by passing a gas of known concentration      through all of the components in the sample analysis system that the      process gas would flow through, and adjusting the response of the gas      analysis system to equal the value of the known calibration gas.      Calibrating in this manner allows for compensation of the total system for      losses in filter elements and other pneumatic components, for changes in      dilution air flow rates, and for changes in process gas flow rates. </PAR><PAR>  A cylinder of calibration gas 110 is connected through line 111 to a      bulkhead 112, which is connected to an orifice protection filter 114 and      orifice 116 to a solenoid valve 118. Solenoid valve 118 allows the flow of      calibration gas to be initiated either locally or remotely by a remote      controller. The calibration valve is located as close to the filter port      as possible to prevent condensation from forming in the calibration lines      between calibrations. From solenoid valve 118, the calibration gas passes      through calibration line 120 and line 108 into the filter cavity of the      probe and passes through all system components at the same flow rates and      conditions as the process gas. </PAR><PAR>  Concerning the analysis device 103, the analyzer may be any one of several      types normally used in the art including infrared, electrochemical, solid      membrane or ion mobility. Among the gases which may be measured are one or      more of SO.sub.2, Cl.sub.2, ClO.sub.2, NH.sub.3, HF, CO, CO.sub.2,      O.sub.2, HCl, TRS, total sulfur, NO and NO.sub.2. </PAR><PAR>  Due to the compact size of the probe assembly, it is also possible to      enclose the entire analysis unit in a single housing, and this embodiment      is shown in FIG. 4. Housing 130 encloses all gas analysis elements,      including an analyzer 140 of the type previously described. In addition,      the gas analyzer used must be capable of withstanding temperatures of      120.degree. to 150.degree. F. and moderate vibration. </PAR><PAR>  The analyzer elements shown in FIG. 4 generally correspond to those shown      in FIG. 3, with the exception that a sample analysis line 132 is taken off      diluted sample line 90. Gas analysis line 132 includes an orifice 134 and      a pump includes a sample vent 142 Pump 136 may be replaced by an air      aspirated eductor located between analyzer 140 and vent 142. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, FIG. 4 shows a method of producing dry and conditioned air by      utilizing an air clean-up unit 150 comprising, in series, a pair of      filters 152 and 154 connected to a common drain 155, a regenerative air      dryer 156, a pressure regulator 158, a gauge 160 and a final filter 162.
