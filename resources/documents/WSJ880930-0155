In a statement, MasterCard said it is &quot;researching a cost-based multiple-rate structure.&quot; MasterCard's executive committee is expected to review the research results in coming months.    Credit-card industry analysts are interpreting the statement as a sign that MasterCard may expand its fee structure to three rates from two. The new rate might lessen the sting for merchants of the previously announced rate increase.    Despite the review, MasterCard said it is committed to increasing the so-called interchange rates, effective Jan. 1.    Interchange fees vary according to how sophisticated a merchant's equipment is for getting a credit-card purchase approved. For the average sale of $70, MasterCard is increasing its fee 29% for electronically approved transactions to $1.09 from 84 cents. For standard transactions, such as mail orders, the fee for a $61 purchase would jump 6.8%, to $1.25.    The interchange fee is paid to the banks that issue the MasterCards to consumers to offset losses on credit cards. H. Spencer Nilson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a trade newsletter, has estimated that MasterCard's new fees will generate an additional $212 million for banks, for a total of $1.3 billion.    Russell E. Hogg, MasterCard's president and chief executive officer, said in a speech earlier this week to credit-card executives in San Francisco, &quot;We remain committed to the principle that interchange rates must be cost-based, . . . but we also recognize the need to remain competitive.&quot;    At that same conference, Visa International's president, Charles Russell, said that bank card association would rescind an April 1, 1989, increase in its interchange fee if MasterCard would do likewise.    The Visa increase hasn't incurred the wrath that MasterCard has, because San Francisco-based Visa is leaving the rates the same but raising the standards that merchants must meet to qualify for its lower, electronic fee. Consequently, merchants and processors have had a tougher time assessing it.    Mr. Nilson, the newsletter publisher, has estimated that the Visa change would knock about 30% of Visa's 1.5 billion transactions a year into the higher rate bracket, generating an added $118 million for banks.    Asked about those estimates, a Visa spokesman said: &quot;In the extreme case, he's right, but we think more merchants will increase their electronic data capture and qualify for the lower rate. This change has been mapped out for years.&quot;    He said one purpose of the change is to cut the amount of &quot;float,&quot; or time lag, in the credit-card payment system. Currently, the float costs Visa member banks an estimated $250 million a year, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
