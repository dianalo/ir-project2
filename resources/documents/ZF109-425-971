confirmed his involvement to Newsbytes sayingthat reports of heavy handedness by Secret Service agents and questionableallegations have made him extremely concerned about this issue.andM;&quot;There have been reports on the Well (a California based online service) ofSecret Service agents accosting 14 year-olds at gunpoint as though theyexpected armed resistance.andP;  The reports are pretty outrageous.andP;  Additionally,there have been only a few indictments to show for the mass confiscation ofequipment that went on.andP;  These actions have a chilling effect on bulletinboard operators throughout the country.andP;  If the allegations of the use ofterrorist search tactics are accurate, it's certainly disproportionate to theacts under investigation.&quot;andM;Kapor told Newsbytes he is attempting to collect information on the specificsof the early May Sun Devil execution of 27 search warrants at suspectedhacker's homes.andP;  These searches, which resulted in the seizure ofapproximately 40 computer systems, are the subject of many of the complaintsthat have reached Kapor.andP;  He says it's difficult to collect the data to get acomplete picture of the case.andP;  There has been very little specificinformation released by government, he added.andM;He added that he is working with the two law firms, Silverglate andamp; Good ofBoston and New York's Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman toobtain as much information as possible concerning these cases.andP;  &quot;When we haveenough information to get a better picture of what's happened here, we'lldecide what steps we may take,&quot; said Kapor, referring to a publishedstatement that he was about to launch a $200,000 defense fund.andM;Secret Service spokesperson Richard Adams, speaking to Newsbytes about thequotes attributed to Kapor, said, &quot;I can't believe that Mr. Kapor is familiarwith the facts of these cases.andP;  We're not talking about kids' pranks here.andO;We're talking about people tampering with 911 emergency codes and criticalhospital records.andP;  I'm sure the public will agree that these activities arebeyond what we might see as kids exploring computer use.&quot;andM;Robert Corbin, Attorney General of the State of Arizona and a participant inthe May 9th press conference which made the Sun Devil operation public, toldNewsbytes that, while he had not seen the Kapor quotes, &quot;We are very capableand knowledgeable in the law and are not going to violate anyone's civilliberties.andP;  For us to prosecute anyone, there must be probable cause of acrime.andP;  If he (Kapor) is concerned about this case, let him follow it throughthe jury process.&quot; It is in Corbin's jurisdiction that the alleged attempt toelectronically break into and alter a medical database at Barrow NeurologicalInstitute occurred.andM;Stephen McNamee, U.S.andP;  Attorney for the District of Arizona and anotherparticipant in the May 9th news conference, told Newsbytes that he could notcomment on Kapor's statements other than to say that &quot;We only prosecute casesin which there is probability that a crime was committed.&quot;andM;Tim Holtzen, Assistant U.S.andP;  Attorney for the Arizona District and directlyinvolved in the investigation, commented further to Newsbytes, &quot;One ofKapor's concerns seems to be that over-zealous Secret Service agents may begoing too far in their investigations of this case.andP;  One of the beauties ofour legal system is that judges must review search warrants before they canbe executed as a safety protection against such over-zealousness.andP;  In thecarrying out of the Sun Devil investigation, judges all across the countrysigned these warrants.&quot;andM;Industry pioneer Dan Bricklin, codeveloper of the landmark VisiCalc program,told Newsbytes that, while he was not familiar with the Sun Devil details, hehad discussed the issue briefly with Kapor and feels that the concern ishealthy, &quot;We cannot lump criminals and those simply exploring the uses ofcomputers together under the term hacker.andP;  Some people, while exploringcomputer communications, may perform inappropriate actions but, if they arewithout malice, they may not be criminal activities.andP;  There are certainlycriminals using computers but we must be able to distinguish the difference.andM;&quot;Additionally, we are entering into new fields of first amendment protectionconcerns.andP;  Most computer bulletin board operators set them up because theybelieve deeply in opening lines of communications to the public.andP;  Shouldtheir equipment be seized because someone else puts illegal information ontothe system? If we extend the logic of such seizures, what happens if I call amajor corporation and leave an illegal item on its voice mail system? Willthe government seize the corporation's telephone system? There are manytroubling issues here and I applaud Mitch's involvement.&quot;andM;(Barbara E. McMullen andamp; John F. McMullen/19900602)</TEXT></DOC>
