The army denied Arab accounts that the woman suffocated from thegas and said she died of natural causes.   Two Palestinians were reported wounded by gunfire and 51 injuredby rubber bullets, tear gas and beatings in a battle betweenPalestinians and Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip.   At least 144 Palestinians have died in the rebellion that beganDec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N.figures. An Israeli soldier and a 15-year-old Jewish settler alsohave been killed.   Arabs attacked Arab merchants who defied Palestine LiberationOrganization orders to close, firebombing the shop of a Jerusalemmoneychanger and setting stalls ablaze in the Bethlehem producemarket, police and witnesses reported. An Arab passerby wasreported injured by the firebomb.   Soldiers clashed for a second day in Gaza with Arabs protestingthe deportation of eight Palestinians to Lebanon on Monday.   Five were from the 28-mile-long coastal strip captured fromEgypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel accused the deportees ofinciting much of the four months of violence Palestinians call``the uprising.''   Soldiers also raided the West Bank village of Salfit, 21 milesnorth of Jerusalem. The army said several dozen Arabs were arrestedin the village which has declared itself ``liberated'' from Israelioccupation. Israeli media said 70 were arrested.   At the United Nations, the PLO asked for a Security Councilmeeting on the deportations. It was tentatively set for Thursday.   The first letter from an Israeli Jew known to have beenpublished by an Arab nationalist newspaper urged Arabs to end theviolence. The author, 13-year-old Lior Kay of Tel Aviv, said hewanted to start a dialogue with Palestinian children.   Soldiers on patrol in south Lebanon, where Israel maintains a``security zone'' just north of the frontier, surprised threeguerrillas before dawn in bushes about 100 yards from the borderfence near the Kfar Yuval collective farm, the army said.   ``We surrounded the terrorists from all sides,'' the Israelinews agency Itim quoted one soldier as saying. ``They tried to fleeand we fired on them. They were killed on the spot.''   An army statement said the Arabs were on a hostage-takingmission, armed with M-16 rifles, hand grenades and four rockets. Itwas the second attempt to infiltrate that area in nine days and the10th cross-border guerrilla operation since November.   Israeli officials have linked guerrilla raids to the rebellionamong the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied territories,which Israel has governed since seizing them from Jordan and Egypt21 years ago.   ``What is happening today with the riots in the territoriespropels guerrilla organizations to try to show more participationin the events,'' said the army's northern commander, Maj. Gen.Yossi Peled.   In Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, soldiers fired on protestersoutside a school, hitting two teen-agers in the legs, U.N. workersand hospital officials said.   Officials at the U.N. clinic and Dr. Ahmed Yassih of ShifaHospital, where some were treated, said 51 other people in the campwere injured by rubber bullets, tear gas and beatings.   Army spokesmen confirmed the violence at Jabaliya and said thecasualty reports were being checked. They said the army closed theJabaliya, Nusseirat and Khan Yunis camps to outsiders and orderedresidents of the Shati camp to stay indoors.   Soldiers hurled a tear gas canister into the home of WadfahFarraj Allah, 70, and she was dead on arrival at the U.N. clinic inJabaliya, said Christine Debaigh, spokeswoman for the U.N. Reliefand Works Agency, which cares for Palestinian refugees.   Shifa Hospital officials said Mrs. Allah suffocated afterinhaling the gas. Warnings on canisters say the contents can belethal if inhaled in a small, enclosed space.   An army spokesman rejected the account, saying that ``results ofan autopsy carried out by the (government-run) PathologicalInstitute in Abu Kabir showed the woman died of natural causes.''   He said the institute also determined that a 21-year-old Arabman from Khan Yunis who was reported dead Tuesday perished ofnatural causes. Arab sources had said he died as a result of teargas inhalation.</TEXT></DOC>
