Yet even the comparatively modest claims the two WesternEuropean nations can make in this regard represent an awesome militarycapability that the USSR (and, to a lesser extent, the US) cannot affordto ignore. Indeed, the recent proposals both superpowers have made todismantle all their European-based intermediate-range missiles differsharply in particulars but raise the same fundamental question: Whatrole will the other nuclear forces in Europe have in the future militarybalance? The Europeans are unlikely to place their limited strategicforces on the bargaining table along with those of the USSR and the USunless the superpowers impose severe constraints on their own strategic-weaponprograms, and in particular on their strategic-defense programs. Thedeployment of such defense systems poses a worrisome dilemma for theEuropeans: while in the near term a Soviet anti-ballistic-missile (ABM)system might have only marginal military impact, over the longer terma novel, exotic defense could conceivably nullify the dependent deterrentBritain and France have so arduously sought. At the same time and Americansystem such as the Strategic Defense Initiative could, by decouplingthe defense of Europe from that of the US, increase the need for preciselysuch an independent deterrent in the minds of the British and the French.</TEXT></DOC>
