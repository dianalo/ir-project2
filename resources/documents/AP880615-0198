Asked if Syria could do more to bring about the release of thehostages, Abdallah Bouhabib said: ``Physically, the answer is yes;politically, I don't know.''   Pro-Iranian Shiites believed to hold nine American hostages inLebanon might take reprisals against their captives if pressed toohard by the Syrians, Bouhabib said at a briefing for reporters.   Late last month, Syrian troops ringed the area of south Beirutwhere the hostages are thought to be held, but did not try to gaintheir release.   Bouhabib said his only information about the hostages was thatthey were alive in Beirut's southern suburbs under the control ofthe Hezbollah faction and Iranian guards.   The ambassador said he disapproved of negotiating with thecaptors because that course spawned additional seizures. He blamedIran for the hostage-taking. ``That is Iran's brand of diplomacy,''he said.   Bouhabib said he had no knowledge of a report that the UnitedStates had sent an envoy to Beirut to seek the hostages' release.State Department spokesman Charles Redman said he would have nocomment on the report that appeared in The Guardian newspaper inLondon.   ``I just stay with our position that we don't talk aboutoperational questions,'' Redman said.   The Guardian, quoting Shiites sources in Beirut it did notidentify, said the envoy returned to Lebanon last Sunday for asecond round of secret talks with Hezbollah. The article did notname the envoy.   Terry Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent, is thelongest-held American hostage in Lebanon. He was captured in March1985.   The only concrete solution to ending hostage-taking, Bouhabibsaid, is to restore order to strife-torn Lebanon where both theSyrians and the Israelis have a military presence.   The Lebanese are committed to the removal of all foreign forcesfrom their country, but they recognize that Syria will always playa role in their future.   Lebanese President Amin Gemayel, who has been working forconstitutional reform that would reconcile various factions inLebanon, does not intend to seek re-election when his term expiresin September.   Constitutional reform has been put on the back burner untilafter Lebanon's Parliament elects a new president sometime betweenJuly 23 and Sept. 23, Bouhabib said.   At least 12 people are seeking to succeed Gemayal.</TEXT></DOC>
