The board invited both parties to meet with a federal mediator in New York next Wednesday for intensive mediation. Pan Am said it was willing to do so. A union official declined to say whether the union would.    As reported, the board released the company and the union from their long-stalled contract negotiations after Pan Am declined to submit to federal arbitration. The Teamsters are legally free to strike the carrier after a 30-day cooling-off period ending Feb. 21.    William F. Genoese, head of the airline division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said &quot;They (the mediation board) have already released us from our formal negotiations with Pan Am. We're proceeding with our strike plans,&quot; he said.    Pan Am said it has begun to recruit employees to replace striking workers. The union represents about 4,300 Pan Am ticket and reservations agents and other employees. They have been working under a contract that was negotiated in 1978 and was scheduled to be renegotiated in 1981.    Pan Am has tried to reach a pact with its major unions on $180 million annually in cost savings in the three-year period that began Jan. 1. So far, it has won more than $110 million a year in savings from its pilots', flight engineers' and attendants' unions. But the Teamsters and Pan Am's transport workers' unions have resisted concessions. </TEXT></DOC>
