The health effects presented in the article (74 premature deaths per year per gigawatt of coal-fired power) were derived from statistical studies of public mortality rates and pollutant concentrations which were (and still are) subject to considerable uncertainty. They were also calculated assuming that mid-1970s emissions of sulfur oxides and particulates would remain essentially unchanged. Coal power-plant emissions have been markedly reduced over the past decade, and calculated public mortality rates would -- just on those grounds -- be substantially lower.    In any event, I have some difficulty supporting his thesis that, in 27 months of operation, Chernobyl-4 &quot;saved more lives from coal's ill-effects . . . than it took by radiation or will take in the future.&quot; Using his arithmetic, two and a quarter years of a coal-equivalent Chernobyl-4 (2.25 gigawatts) would yield less than 170 fatalities; deaths among Soviet plant workers and fire-rescue personnel at Chernobyl exceeded 200. Using the same caliber of questionable extrapolation, several thousand long-term fatalities from radiation-induced cancer among the public are projected for the Soviet Union and Europe.    This isn't to diminish the bottom-line validity of Prof. Beckmann's comparison of coal and nuclear impacts on public health. A health impact he didn't include was the toll of occupational deaths, illness and injuries that have traditionally accompanied the extraction, processing, transportation and disposal of power-plant fuels which is many times greater for coal than for the nuclear fuel cycle.    A final point of comparison between uranium and all other fuels is the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; -- the &quot;tropicalization&quot; of the industrialized temperate zone by the increasing carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. There is uncertainty about when this impact will be felt, but nuclear power contributes nothing to this eventual catastrophe.    The case for nuclear power must be made on factual bases -- on economic, health, safety and environmental grounds. Nuclear power can (and must) make its case without resort to excessive and insupportable rhetoric. Now, if we could only get the &quot;anti-nukes&quot; to follow suit.    Morton I.
