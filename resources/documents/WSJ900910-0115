The path is not easy, but President Turgut Ozal has shownno fear of retaliation by his Iraqi neighbors or qualms aboutriding roughshod over protests from across Turkey's politicalspectrum that he is leading the nation into a treacherousmilitary adventure.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Ozal strengthened his hand when the Turkish parliamentvoted to transfer to the government its powers to allow thenation to host foreign troops and to deploy its 800,000-manarmed forces abroad. Turkey has the second-largest armedforce in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after theU.S.   &quot;This gives them the power to do whatever they want to do,or maybe nothing at all,&quot; said a senior Western diplomat inAnkara. &quot;But it is a strong political signal of determinationto be with the West, pushing for Iraq's total withdrawal fromKuwait.&quot;   Washington might like to see Turkey's Moslem troops on theground in Saudi Arabia, but Prime Minister Yildirim Akbuluthas said troop movements would be a last resort. However, aTurkish ship might be sent to join the Gulf naval blockade,he said.   The new powers might be used to allow increased U.S. useof air bases near the Iraqi border or even troops to putpressure on Iraq from a second front. But the Westerndiplomat, who declined to be identified, said there had beenno such request for troop deployments and nor was onepending.   Mr. Akbulut said he needed the extra war powers fromparliament to &quot;protect Turkey's higher interests during andafter the crisis . . . and help a speedy and active policy,&quot;adding later that &quot;this is not permission to declare war.&quot;   Others saw different motives for what right-wing True PathParty leader Suleyman Demirel said was Mr. Ozal being &quot;moreroyalist than a king&quot; in his support for U.S. policies in theGulf.   The question of how Turkey is to be compensated for atleast $3 billion of economic damage from the embargo on Iraqis likely to top the agenda when Mr. Ozal meets PresidentBush Sept. 24 in Washington.   In addition to a fall in trade and transit revenue,Turkey's tourism industry is beginning to suffer badlybecause of the proximity to the Gulf crisis, said BehaettinYucel, head of the Turkish Travel Agents Association. Thisblow defies an air of normality in Turkey, where even thetransit of 20,000 refugees from Iraq has passed almostunnoticed.   Mr. Yucel estimated that 100,000 expected visitors hadcanceled their trips as of last Monday and said that charterflights from Spain have been canceled completely even for thewinter season.   &quot;We estimate losses of $250 million so far, not countingtransport and shopping,&quot; Mr. Yucel said.   To help out, the U.S. is going ahead with a loan forseveral hundred million dollars from the U.S. Export-Importbank for co-production of military helicopters, possiblySikorsky Black Hawks, diplomats say. The U.S. also is likelyto increase quotas for Turkish textile imports and pressurefor the approval of held-up International Monetary Fund loanstotaling $1.4 billion.   But economic questions alone do not explain the way Turkeyhas gone out on a limb.   &quot;After the crisis, the map of the Middle East will changecompletely . . . if there is a better place for us in theworld, we must take it,&quot; President Ozal told Sabah newspaperthis week.   Right-wing Turkish newspapers have raised the question ofrecovering &quot;our land&quot; in the oil-rich provinces of Mosul andKerkuk just south of Turkey whose loss in the 1920s toBritish-mandated Iraq is still regretted by many Turks.   &quot;Mr. Ozal is a statesman who has never mentioned this. Butmy personal opinion is that we have a rightful claim to Mosuland Kirkuk,&quot; said Altemur Kilic, editor of the right-wingTercuman newspaper. &quot;This would need to be taken intoconsideration (at any peace conference).&quot;   Mr. Kilic said it also was important that any conferencerule out the idea of an independent state in the north ofIraq for the Kurds, a large minority in Turkey where they aredenied any ethnic rights.   Such arguments carry little weight with the manycommentators who are calling for Turkey to be kept away fromthe quicksands of the gulf, remembering the bloody campaignsduring World War I when the Ottoman Turkish Empire lostcontrol of the Arabian peninsula.   &quot;I see the wish for war in Prime Minister Akbulut and theman who gives him instructions, Ozal,&quot; said Erdal Inonu,leader of the main Social Democrat opposition party. &quot;Whateveryone will understand from this is that we want to go towar to increase our territory. It's a dream to think we willtake a share of the Middle East. This is gambling.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
