He and I have been having at each other in these Saturdaybroadcasts on and off for eight hears now. They have been fairfights from first to last, and well, Mr. President, I'm going tomiss them. Come to think, our first go-around had to do with SocialSecurity, which is what I'd like to talk about today.   Back in the beginning of the 1980s, many people thought SocialSecurity was finished. The new budget director said it would soon bebankrupt. A lot of people new to government simply panicked, and inApril 1981, huge benefit reductions were proposed.   Well, there is no need for that, and the Senate put a stop to it.The system did need some changes, and two years later, we agreed tothem. Let me be clear, Mr. President, you share the credit for thosechanges. They've been in place now long enough to measure theresults. Let me give you then a year-end report on your SocialSecurity finances.   I can report that the trust funds are in fine shape, in greatshape. They are rising by $109,440,000 the day. The actuaries tellus they will continue building up for the next 40 years. And that'sthe good news, so much that of a sudden we are hearing there is toomuch money in Social Security and that much of it goes to people whodon't need it.   Happily, this week, a revolutionary new study by the Bureau ofthe Census put an end to this proposition. The Census counted everypenny of personal income and government benefits for the wholepopulation, enabling us to judge just how well off people are withSocial Security and how badly off they would be without it. Prettybad is the answer. Without Social Security, almost half of theelderly would be poor today. With Social Security, Medicare andother government programs, the number of elderly poor has all butdisappeared.   Let us then hear no more about ``middle-class entitlements.''Social Security is the most successful program for fighting povertyever devised in our land.   I wish I could report that the new census study concluded thesame for children. It did not. Save for those who receive survivorsinsurance, government benefit programs hardly touch child poverty.The new Census report tells us what we have suspected for a longtime, but never seen actually computed. This is that there are twokinds of children in America, and they live in two kinds offamilies. Children in two-parent families, as near as makes nomatter, will never be poor. By contrast, children who live insingle-parent families will almost always be poor sooner or later.And their numbers are staggering. As many as one-third of ourchildren live this way today.   We've become the first industrial nation on Earth in whichchildren are the worst off group. This has become a fact whichdistinguishes America from other democracies. In some of thosecountries they would no more allow a child to remain poor than theywould allow one to remain sick when there was a cure for theillness. That is why leaders such as Governor Mario Cuomo havedeclared a ``Decade of the Child.'' It is the great challenge beforeus. If we get to work, it will really be a happy New Year.   This is Senator Pat Moynihan, and thank you for listening.</TEXT></DOC>
