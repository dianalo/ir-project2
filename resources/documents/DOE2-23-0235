The installation is usedto investigate the low-temperature plasma of thermo-emission transducers.Synchronization of a pulsed beam with the processes studied is used toinvestigate the nonstationary plasma for obtaining field distributioncurves resolved in time in the interelectron gap. It is provided by applicationof the two-channel 65-30 A generator, one signal of which gives the processstart in the palsma, and another, synchronized with the first one, controlsthe electron beam.</TEXT></DOC>
