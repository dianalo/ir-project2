Major, whose candidacy was endorsed by Mrs. Thatcher, fell twovotes short of the needed majority, but his opponents concededdefeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected.   Aides said Mrs. Thatcher was ``thrilled.'' Major, 47, herTreasury chief, is the youngest person to be elected prime ministersince the 19th century.   ``It is a very exciting thing to become leader of theConservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to followone of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has everhad,'' Major said.   He called Mrs. Thatcher ``a very great prime minister indeed.''   ``Our job now I think is quite clear. We are going to unitetotally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next generalelection,'' said Major, who emerged smiling from his residence at11 Downing St.   Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltinehad 131 votes, and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in asecret ballot election among Tory members of Parliament.   ``I congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-classcampaign, fought without rancor or bitterness, which I believe laysthe basis for the unity of our party,'' Heseltine said momentsafter the vote was announced.   Hurd also quickly conceded. He said the party needed to unite,and ``John Major is the right leader for this task.''   Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the ConservativeParty committee that supervised the election, announced that athird ballot was not required and Major was elected.   Mrs. Thatcher left her residence at 10 Downing St. tocongratulate Major, who as chancellor of the exchequer is hernext-door neighbor at No. 11.   Mrs. Thatcher intended to submit her resignation to QueenElizabeth II at Buckingham Palace once a new leader was elected.Major would then be called to be confirmed as prime minister andfirst lord of the treasury.   Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreignsecretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year.   He moved up quickly in a five-day campaign for the leadershipafter Mrs. Thatcher announced Thursday that she would resign ratherthan continue a leadership fight against Heseltine.   By the weekend, opinion polls showed that Major was nearly ashighly regarded by the public as was Heseltine, who has beenprominent for a decade.   Major attracted support from prominent figures on the right wingof the Conservative Party, although his friends insisted Major'sown views were more liberal than many supposed.   He described himself as conservative on economic issues butliberal on social issues.   Major epitomized the self-reliant, hard-working achiever whoMrs. Thatcher encouraged. Born March 29, 1943, he was the son of acircus performer, left school at 16 and was a laborer and at onetime a welfare recipient.   Major became a banker and Conservative Party activist, and waselected to Parliament in the first Thatcher victory of 1979. He wasappointed to a junior ministerial post in 1985, then to the No. 2position in the Treasury in 1987.   He emerged as a possible heir-apparent when Mrs. Thatcherappointed him foreign secretary in July 1989, and then chancellorof the exchequer three months later.   He inherits a party and a government that have been torn bycontroversy over European policy and local taxes, and depressedafter months lagging behind the opposition Labor Party in opinionpolls.   The government has until mid-1992 to call an election. Recentopinion polls, however, suggested that any new leader would greatlyenhance Tory popularity, and Major was rated as favorably asHeseltine.   Major has indicated he would review the widely hated ``polltax,'' which replaced the property tax with a flat charge againstall adults, no matter how wealthy.   He entered the leadership race jointly with Hurd, whose positionas foreign secretary appears secure.   Tall and deliberate, Major has neat gray hair, clean-cutfeatures and a quiet manner of speech nearly free of theinflections of class and geography that still pigeonhole so manyBritons.   He sees increased social mobility as ``one of the greatestachievements of the last 10 years,'' and says his goal is ``agenuinely classless society in which people can rise to whateverlevel that their own abilities and their own good fortune may takethem.''   Once asked if regretted not having gone to university, he said``not a bit.''   ``It has been of immense value to me to have been on the otherside of the fence and to know what it was like to face a fewdifficulties, and I don't regret any of that.''   Major and his wife Norma have a daughter, Elizabeth, 19, and ason, James, 15.</TEXT></DOC>
