The amount of deposition and thebehaviours of activity of catalyst and deposition depend upon the typeand treating conditions of metal chloride. Carbon tetrachloride entersthe pores of zeolite at room temperature and reacts with acidic sitein the passage. Although parts of germanium tetrachloride and titaniumtetrachloride get into the pores of zeolite, the deposition is limitedto the entrance of passage, while tin tetrachloride deposits on the outsidesurface of pore whether the pore is open or not. The catalytic activityof mordenite modified by the chemical vapour deposition of those compoundsis different from that of parent material, mordenite, in the methanolconversion on that modified mordenite. The increase of the selectivityto C{sub 1} to C{sub 3} hydrocarbons and decrease of polymethylbenzenein aromatic compounds depend upon the structure of core rather than theacidity.
