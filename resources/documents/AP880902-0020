The five astronauts were preparing to end their 56-hour missionThursday afternoon by simulating a shuttle landing with a flat tirewhen the computer shutdown cut the rehearsal short.   ``I'm sure they'll be looking at it to see why it went down, butnobody here considers it to be a big problem that the simulationended early,'' said NASA Johnson Space Center spokesman JamesHartsfield.   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials stressedthat there was no problem with any kind of computer used in actualflight control.   In Huntsville, Ala., meanwhile, engineers at Marshall SpaceFlight Center said Thursday's fifth and final test of seals andjoints on the space shuttle booster rocket lifted their confidencein parts redesigned after the Challenger disaster.   ``Based on all appearances the test was a complete success,''said Jim Thomas, technical assistant to the manager of the solidrocket motor project.   The two-minute static test firing, with the booster segmentanchored in a $25 million test stand, put launch-style pressure onthe redesigned joints.   The seals are designed to keep internal hot gases inside thetwin rockets that help kick shuttles into earth orbit. The failureof a joint in one of Challenger's two boosters was blamed for theJanuary 1986 explosion that killed all seven crew members.   Before the computer crash at Johnson Space Center, officialssaid, the Discovery crew handled all the simulated problems posedto them during a dress rehearsal for their flight, which is slatedfor late September or early October.   The 56-hour mock mission began about an hour late Tuesdaymorning because of an earlier problem with the shuttle simulator.   But other glitches faced by the Discovery crew were intentional,as commander Rick Hauck, pilot Richard Covey and missionspecialists David Hilmers, Mike Lounge and George Nelson wereplaced in situations designed to test their ability to solve amultitude of problems that could encounter on an actual mission.   Shortly after launch Tuesday, the astronauts were forced toalter their course and enter a low orbit after NASA trainers stageda main engine failure.   On Wednesday, Nelson and Lounge had to go outside the orbiter tofix a stuck tilt-table needed to deploy a $100 millioncommunications satellite. That simulation was done in a water tank,spokeswoman Barbara Selby said.</TEXT></DOC>
