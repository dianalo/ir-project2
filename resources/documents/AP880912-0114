(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Processors handling the alligators killedin Florida's first gator season in two decades say they are workingovertime to keep up with successful hunters.   ``We've been working until 2 or 3 in the morning every night,''said Kenneth Geiger, who runs one of 29 facilities in Florida thatskin and butcher alligators. ``They're stacking up like cordwood.''   Less than halfway through the monthlong hunt, which began Sept.1 and was authorized because of the proliferation of thealligators, several hunters are near the quota of 15 each. The huntis monitored by the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,but the 238 licensed hunters are not required to file records untiltwo weeks after the hunt ends.   ``We won't know anything about numbers until after theharvest,'' said Scott Ball, public information specialist with thecommission. ``We kept a tally the first day, and we counted atleast 131 gators.''   If each hunter bags the quota, 3,450 alligators will be killed.The commission has estimated about 2,600 alligators would be killed.   ``We've been going literally 24 hours a day,'' said G.O. Parrot,a processor near Bushnell. ``We've probably done about 50 or 60since the season started.''   ``It takes us about an hour a foot and we've done 200 feet ofgator and boxed 750 pounds of meat,'' said Barry Holdridge, thechief processor at Hooks Alligator Product in Davie. ``If everyhunter gets their quota, we will be up to our eyes in gator.''   A licensed processor will sometimes buy the whole alligator for$30 to $50 a foot. Other hunters pay a processing fee and get backthe meat and hide.</TEXT></DOC>
