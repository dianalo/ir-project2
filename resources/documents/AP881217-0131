WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Saturday hewould do his best to prevent Palestinian terrorist attacks but couldnot guarantee that some militants wouldn't step out of line.   Palestinian leaders said the PLO used its first official meetingwith the United States Friday to assure Washington it will pressureits followers to refrain from terrorism.   ``We will do all our best to stop all this (terrorism),'' Arafattold reporters after returning to his headquarters in Tunis.   In an apparent reference to some radical Palestinian factionsthat oppose his strategies, the PLO chief said he could notguarantee that ``one person here or one individual there'' might notresort to terrorism.   ``Give me one example of any ruler who can have complete controlwith all the groups,'' he said.   The PLO serves as an umbrella organization for eight differentguerrilla factions which constitute the Palestinians' military arm.The main group is Arafat's Fatah, but other PLO factions backed bySyria mount operations against Israel and its embassies abroad. Thefactions sometimes fight each other.   The PLO, bankrolled by the 21 member states of the Arab League,has representatives in about 100 countries.   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman added: ``We will use all ourefforts and all our influence on our people all over the world notto involve or engage in any operation against civilians, innocentpeople or Americans.''   Arafat's renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel'sright to exist led the U.S. government on Wednesday to drop its banon contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization and to open``a substantive dialogue'' with the group.   In another boost for the PLO, Algeria accepted the credentials ofthe first ambassador of the newly declared state of Palestine, theAlgerian government news agency said. In Friday's report based on aForeign Ministry statement, the ambassador was identified as MoudherDadjani.   Arafat described Friday's 90-minute meeting between the U.S.ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., and a four-memberPLO delegation as a ``step in the right direction'' toward a ``justand comprehensive settlement.''   ``No peace can be settled without their (U.S.) participation andtheir efforts,'' he said at a brief news conference.   Arafat said the PLO's main priority in the talks is to push foran early convening of an international peace conference on theMiddle East. U.S. officials say an international conference is nosubstitute for direct Arab-Israeli talks.   Abdul-Rahman charged Israel was trying to undermine the U.S.-PLOcontacts by using deadly force against Palestinians. ``The Israeligovernment is trying to sabotage this dialogue, to stop it,'' hesaid.   He said PLO officials had raised this issue in the talks Fridayand urged the U.S. government to pressure Israel to halt the use ofdeadly force against the yearlong Palestinian uprising in the WestBank and Gaza Strip, in which more than 320 Palestinians and 13Israelis have been killed.   Arafat also condemned killings in the occupied territories,terming them a ``continuation of state terrorism.''   Abdel-Rahman said the PLO has tightened security measures inrecent days for fear of possible attacks by the Israeli secretservices.   He said the next round of talks would be held afterPresident-elect George Bush takes office Jan. 20.   He said that at the next sessions, the PLO will seek a ``commonunderstanding'' with the Americans on the issue of an internationalconference, Palestinian statehood and withdrawal of Israeli forcesfrom the occupied territories.   ``We will not have results or solutions in one day,''Abdul-Rahman said. ``It's not like a knockout in boxing. We must gopoint-by-point.'   Last month in Algeria, the PLO proclaimed an independent state,without specifying its borders. U.S. officials have said the openingof a dialogue with the PLO does not represent recognition of thestate.   The PLO spokesman, giving a detailed account of Friday's talks,said the Americans outlined their attitude toward terrorism andemphasized that any PLO terrorism would derail the dialogue.   U.S. Embassy officials on Saturday declined comment on the talks,saying any further comment would come from the State Department inWashington.   Abdul-Rahman said the Palestinian delegates emphasized theiropposition to individual, group and state terrorism.   ``We will urge all Palestinians individuals and all Palestinianorganizations to adopt this strategy for peace,'' he said. ``No onehas the right to violate this Palestinian strategy. Any mistake fromour side will deteriorate the whole dialogue with the Americans.''</TEXT></DOC>
