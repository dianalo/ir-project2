The wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis was feeling ``very poorly''and wanted little else revealed to the public, said Dr. Gerald R.Plotkin, the governor's personal physician.   ``Kitty doesn't want to discuss any more about her condition,''Plotkin said at a Tuesday night news conference. ``We don't want tosay any more.''   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, underwent four weeks of treatment foralcoholism earlier this year at a Rhode Island facility and haspreviously admitted she spent years addicted to diet pills.   Plotkin refused to answer questions on whether Mrs. Dukakis'illness was related to her previous alcohol and drug problems.   ``Although her condition has improved somewhat during the pastfew hours, until she feels better and has an opportunity to discussher condition with her doctors and to fully evaluate the results ofthe tests ... she has asked that no further statements be made,''Plotkin said.   Mrs. Dukakis was taken by ambulance on Monday night to Brighamand Women's Hospital. She underwent tests Tuesday, one year afterthe governor was defeated in his presidential bid.   Dukakis spokeswoman Mindy Lubber had said Mrs. Dukakis wassuffering flu-like symptoms. But Plotkin refused to say whether shewas suffering influenza or whether her life had at any time been indanger.   A hospital spokeswoman refused to disclose Mrs. Dukakis'condition Tuesday night. Mindy Lubber, a spokeswoman for thegovernor, said she would be unable to update Mrs. Dukakis' status.   The governor, who spent all Tuesday at his wife's side, cancelledall appointments scheduled today.   Lubber said Plotkin went to the Dukakis's Brookline home Mondaynight after Mrs. Dukakis awoke ``feeling particularly ill'' andrecommended she be taken to the hospital.   ``After five days at home during which Mrs. Dukakis experienceddizziness, headaches and severe nausea, she was admitted to thehospital ... she is continuing to experience those same symptoms''Tuesday, Plotkin said.   A year ago, Mrs. Dukakis was admitted to a Minneapolis hospitalfor observation after she suffered a fever and chills one weekbefore her husband lost his presidential bid.   The Dukakises were married June 20, 1963, and have threechildren, one of them from Mrs. Dukakis' first marriage. They livein Brookline, a short distance from the hospital.   Dukakis' 86-year-old mother, Euterpe Dukakis, meanwhile, was insatisfactory condition at Beth Israel Hospital, where she wasadmitted Monday after experiencing repeated fainting spells, saidspokeswoman Laurie Veno.   Plotkin said the governor's mother was doing well and wouldlikely be released from the hospital by week's end.</TEXT></DOC>
