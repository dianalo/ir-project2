Kaiser began acquiring in 1942 to fuel his steel mill.    But selling coal assets isn't easy, as the plan's critics argued when Kaiser last month began shopping the properties in an effort to restructure the company. When they sell, coal properties are bringing bargain-basement prices in the midst of a world-wide glut.    And Kaiser's filing last Wednesday under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code -- a move it said it took to avoid an involuntary filing -- brings additional complications. While it gives the coal and steel-fabrication concern some protection from its creditors, it also puts any sale of assets under the scrutiny of the creditors and the bankruptcy court. In the past, some groups with potential claims against Kaiser have opposed the sale of the coal properties.    Bruce Hendry, Kaiser chairman and chief executive officer, has said that he would like to get Kaiser out of the steel and coal business and to concentrate on developing the company's Fontana, Calif., real estate as a high-technology industrial park. The strategy includes upgrading an existing facility at the site for the treatment of hazardous waste from high-technology industries.    Even if the Chapter 11 strategy succeeds, Colorado Springs, Colo.-based Kaiser's creditors aren't likely to get more than a fraction of the value of their claims, Mr. Hendry said. &quot;We're talking really big discounts,&quot; he said. &quot;There isn't anyone who expects to get all his money back.&quot;    Mr. Hendry is optimistic that he can find willing buyers for the coal operations. He points to the size of the reserves -- 1.3 billion tons in Colorado, Utah and New Mexico of the low-sulfur coal preferred by coal users in anticipation of potential acid-rain legislation.    In addition, the company's three operating mines generated about $9.8 million in pre-tax profit for the first nine months of 1986. Mr. Hendry said he expects to raise between $150 million and $225 million from the coal properties' sale.    What makes the prospects of the sale uncertain is that coal prices have plunged. As recently as three years ago, analysts were valuing coal in the ground at as much as $1 a ton; they now say buyers base their purchase price on the property's potential earnings. The analysts declined to put a value on Kaiser's coal properties. At the end of the third quarter, Kaiser had total assets of about $692 million and liabilities of about $633 million.    If the reserves are undervalued and Kaiser can't get the price it wants, Mr. Hendry said, he will sell only the income-producing properties and hold on to the reserves or spin them off to a group of the company's more than 6,000 retirees and their dependents. The group is Kaiser's largest unsecured creditor.    &quot;There are various ways we can sell the coal properties to satisfy some of our obligations,&quot; Mr. Hendry said.    Kaiser's own Chapter 11 filing, while keeping the company's creditors from seizing assets and forcing it into bankruptcy, may prove to be another obstacle. In addition to the resistance the sale could draw from creditors and holders, including former Chairman Monty H. Rial and officers who control its common, the filing and that of its coal unit on Friday blur the picture for potential buyers.    &quot;Who are you going to be negotiating with?&quot; asked a spokeswoman for Cyprus Minerals Co., a coal producer that said it isn't interested in buying Kaiser's coal properties. &quot;Are you going to be negotiating with the trustee, or are you going to be negotiating with Kaiser?&quot;    Mr. Hendry said there are other, if less desirable, ways to raise cash to pursue its goals. Kaiser could sell its steel-fabricating facilities; Mr. Hendry already has said he would sell the plants if an interested buyer were found. But the fabricating division also has been battered by the fall of energy prices and also would probably bring only a fraction of its value.    In addition, Mr. Hendry said, Kaiser could mortgage its Fontana, Calif., real estate holdings. But he is both reluctant and unlikely to do it as long as he has other options. &quot;I never felt very comfortable about doing it, as leveraged as we are,&quot; said Mr. Hendry. </TEXT></DOC>
