<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-1022 </DOCNO><TEXT>For the first time, continuous, moderate power operation of a Nd/sup 3+/:glass fiber bundle laser is reported. The disordered fiber bundle laserconsisted of 1450 fibers, each 100 {mu}m in diameter, with 75 {mu}m core,phosphate laser glass doped at 8 wt. % Nd/sub 2/O/sub 3/. The laser fiberbundle was energized by a xenon flashlamp or, a cw argon arc lamp. Amaximum energy of 0.8 J at 4.9 kW peak power was obtained in the pulsedflashlamp experiments while the maximum cw power of 25 W was obtainedwith the arc lamp. The loss coefficient of 0.0266 cm/sup -1/ was inferredfrom the data. Neither the pulsed nor the cw systems were optimized.The beam profile was imaged with low spatial resolution and found tobe lobed. Beam structure is indicative of coherence. Calculations fora would be ordered fiber array laser show that the beam far field approximatesa Fraunhoffer diffraction pattern for the total aperture as the beamletsfill the apperture area.</TEXT></DOC>
