Nixon tried to organize a mission to rescue 52 Americanhostages in Iran in 1980 shortly after President Jimmy Carter'sattempt failed.   However, the Sunday Telegraph's report said it was not clear ifNixon intended to launch an independent mission or an official onethat would be carried out under the presidency of Ronald Reagan.   In any event, the newspaper said the idea was dropped in October1980 when Iran announced that the hostages at the U.S. Embassy inTehran would be released after the inauguration of a new president.   The weekly newspaper said Nixon held secret talks with Britishhelicopter pilots and ex-servicemen only three months after thefirst attempted rescue in april 1980.   He met the chairman of Bristow Helicopters, Alan Bristow, andseveral former members of the Special Air Service, according to thenewspaper. The SAS is Britain's elite military assault force.   ``Nixon was absolutely serious,'' the newspaper quoted Bristow assaying. ``We had a long and detailed discussion about the chances ofsuccess of a second strike. I told him it could be done, but thestrike force would suffer at least 30 percent casualties.''   A rescue attempt authorized by Carter ended in disaster April 25,1980, when a helicopter collided with a tanker aircraft in anIranian desert, killing eight servicemen.   The Sunday Telegraph quoted unidentified security sources assaying the second mission was conceived by the Republican Partybecause it feared its presidential candidate, Reagan, might inheritthe hostage crisis if he won the election.   The American hostages where freed in January 1981 after 444 daysin captivity.   The British account reported a Nixon aide said, ``We will neitherconfirm nor deny this story. We have nothing to say.'' It did notidentify the aide.   The newspaper said Nixon's plan was inspired by the SAS assaulton gunmen holding hostages at the Iranian Embassy in London on May5, 1980. Four of the five gunmen were killed in the operation, whichsucceeded in freeing the hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
