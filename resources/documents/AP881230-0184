Col. Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair.   ``We did receive it,'' Justice Department spokesman Loye Millersaid. ``There's one for the president and one for the vicepresident. We received it at mid-afternoon.'' The subpoenas werereceived by Robert Ross, the executive assistant to Attorney GeneralDick Thornburgh, Miller said.   A statement released by the White House press office in PalmSprings, Calif., where Reagan is on vacation, said, ``The JusticeDepartment has received a subpoena seeking the president's testimonyat the criminal trial of Oliver North. The subpoena also seeks thediscovery of certain personal records of the president. The subpoenawas not an unanticipated development.   ``It raises significant legal and constitutional questions whichare currently being reviewed by the Department of Justice andcounsel to the president,'' the statement said. ``It would beunprecedented for a president to appear as a witness at a criminaltrial and it's premature to speculate on the final decision thatwill ultimately be taken, but historical precedent suggests anyrelevant information could be provided through written questions andanswers.''   The Washington Post reported in Saturday editions thatunidentified White House and Justice Department officials said theywill fight the subpoenas.   The newspaper also cited an unidentified White House official assaying Reagan viewed the subpoena effort as an attempt to pressurehim into granting a pardon to North before he leaves office. Theofficial said Reagan had not changed his view that the legal processshould run its course.   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said Reagan had knownsince Wednesday that it was likely he would be subpoenaed. WhiteHouse chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein told Reagan on Fridaymorning that the subpoena would be delivered during the afternoon,Popadiuk said.   Bush aides confirmed that the president-elect had received asubpoena Friday.   Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said Bush legal counsel BoydenGray informed the vice president Friday morning that the subpoenawould be delivered that afternoon, and she did not know Bush'sreaction.   She said he was going ahead with his weekend of relaxation atCamp David, Md., and planned no meetings to discuss the trialmatter. Gray, she said, did have conferences on the matter Friday,but she said she could give no further details.   ``The receipt of this is not an unanticipated development, but itis unprecedented,'' said Bush press aide Kristin Taylor.   Bush will take office Jan. 20 and thus will be president when theNorth trial begins Jan. 31.   North, a former White House aide, is facing conspiracy and theftcharges in the Iran-Contra affair.   He is charged with conspiring with former national securityadviser John Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retiredAir Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to illegally divert more than $12million in U.S.-Iran arms-sales profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   National security concerns have placed in jeopardy North's trialon the major conspiracy and theft charges, which involve extensiveuse of classified material.   North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, appearing on ABC News, didnot go into any detail on why Reagan and Bush were subpoenaed.   ``What I do say is this: As you know, a defense lawyer has anobligation to issue a subpoena for every person who has relevantinformation about a matter in court,'' Sullivan said. ``Thepresident himself has indicated he has relevant information.''   Attorneys for the vice president, the White House and the JusticeDepartment were looking into the ``constitutional legal issues''raised by the subpoenas, Taylor said.   In 1973, President Nixon received a subpoena to turn over WhiteHouse tape recordings of conversations with top aides in connectionwith the Watergate scandal. Although Nixon was not required totestify, the Supreme Court ruled that Nixon had to release the tapes.   Tate said she could not say whether Bush's attorneys would fightthe subpoena.   ``What they're saying is that it's unprecedented to do that,''she said in reference to potential Bush testimony.   The issue of how much he knew about North's activities with theContras and the diversion of funds from Iran was the subject ofcontradictory testimony during congressional hearings into theIran-Contra matter.   The subpoena could force Bush to disclose information that hepreviously has refused to divulge.   Bush repeatedly has refused to say what he discussed with Reaganregarding matters involved in the Iran-Contra affair, other thanthat he had reservations about U.S. sales of arms to Iran.   The congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees concludedlast year that there was no evidence Bush knew of the diversion plan.   Bush also said he did not know of North's secret operation tosupply the Contras during the congressional ban on aid, although hisnational security adviser Donald Gregg was well informed on thematter, and Bush met three times with Felix Rodriguez, one of thekey figures helping North in the operation.   Questions also were raised about Bush's statement that he did notknow of the arms-for-hostages nature of the dealings with Iran untillate 1986, when his chief of staff indicated that Israeli operativeAmiram Nir briefed Bush on this aspect in May of 1986.   Bush has said he was told about the Israeli side of theoperation, not the American activity in the same vein.</TEXT></DOC>
