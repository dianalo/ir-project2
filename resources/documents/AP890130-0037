Several troopers were set on fire in Sunday's protest as thebombs exploded in balls of orange flame. Armored vans sprayed teargas at the protesters and police had to charge three times to blockthem from marching through the city.   Police officials had no immediate word on arrests or injuries.They said 10,000 police were deployed across Seoul to block theprotest.   The violence Sunday began when about 6,000 labor union activistsand radical students tried to march to the city center followingseparate rallies.   Workers and students, marching to the beat of brass gongs anddrums, called for the fall of President Roh Tae-woo's administrationand the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan on corruptioncharges.   Police halted the marchers after several hundred yards. Shovingand pushing occurred, but the marchers could not get through.   Students then attacked police. Fighting lasted more than onehour. The labor activists, who were protesting against thegovernment's alleged exploitation of workers to produce cheapexports, did not take part.   Earlier Sunday, several youths hurled firebombs at a courtbuilding and yelled radical slogans before fleeing, police said. Thebombs caused slight damage but there were no reports of injuries,they said.   Dissident leaders who addressed the student rally, whichattracted fewer than 2,000 people, demanded the removal of the42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual defensetreaty.   They also demanded an immediate end to annual U.S.-South Koreanmilitary exercises. The drills practice bringing in U.S.reinforcements in the event North Korea invades again. The communistNorth's 1950 invasion started a three-year war.   The radicals, who lack broad public support, contend the UnitedStates supports military rule in South Korea and keeps troops in thenation to block reunification with the North.   Roh, a former general, took office in February 1988 after winningpresidential elections. He succeeded Chun, another former general,who took power with military backing in 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
