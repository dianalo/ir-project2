GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FRESTEXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A private but fervent debate is under way among American Jewish leaders over whether the carrot, rather than the stick, should be used to encourage Mikhail Gorbachev to open the spigot of Soviet Jewish emigration. The White House and Congress are watching closely.    The 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment denies Moscow certain U.S. trade benefits and U.S. credits until the president certifies that Soviet citizens can emigrate freely. Prodding with this stick yielded initial success. Jewish emigration surged in the 1970s, peaking at 51,320 in 1979. But the Soviets weren't rewarded with a waiver of the trade restrictions. Then, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, ending the detente era. Relations soured and Jewish emigration dwindled to a trickle.    Now, Mr. Gorbachev's promises of glasnost, or openness, have rekindled the issue, and raised basic questions about whether the Soviet leader's words can be trusted and should be rewarded. Moreover, the emigration issue could set a broader pattern of trust-or lack of it-that could spill over into other super-power arenas, including arms control negotiations and the Mideast peace process.    Last month, two prominent Jewish leaders returned from Moscow with assurances that many of the 11,000 long-term &quot;refuseniks,&quot; whose applications to emigrate were rejected, would be released within a year. With Mr. Gorbachev's nonstop diplomacy producing at least the appearance of new opportunities, early signs of change are in the air.    &quot;I felt in 1979 that it was time to consider a waiver of the amendment, but I wasn't getting any supportive signals from the Jewish community,&quot; says Charles Vanik, co-author of the measure. &quot;But now, people are moving from opposing the waiver, to where it becomes a possibility. They could consider it if the (emigration) levels are right,&quot; explains the former Democrat congressman from Ohio, who now practices law here.    The administration has decided that it won't act without a broad consensus from U.S. Jews, for whom the issue is of paramount importance. In 1979, President Carter considered a one-year waiver, but backed away when he didn't receive support from American Jews. Now, the debate is over the timing of when the Soviets should be granted relief from the trade restrictions, which have more symbolic than economic meaning.    Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) says that with U.S.-Soviet relations improving, U.S. officials should be told &quot;we will support them if they will raise the emigration issue with the Soviet Union at the highest levels, if they personally reach the conclusion that substantial emigration will be sustained, and if they seek a one-year waiver of Jackson-Vanik.&quot;    But hardliners, such as Natan Sharansky, a prominent Soviet Jewish emigre, argue that a waiver shouldn't be considered &quot;until at least 50,000 of our brothers every year will be able to leave the Soviet Union.&quot; Israeli officials estimate that about 380,000 Soviet Jews have applied for visas to Israel.    Meanwhile, Moscow may be at a crossroads concerning the future course of emigration. Although Mr. Gorbachev talks about releasing the long-term refuseniks, a new Soviet law promulgated last year could make it tougher for others to exit. The statute says that only those with close relatives abroad will be eligible to emigrate; in the 1970s, many applicants were permitted to leave simply because they were Jewish. On the other hand, Mr. Gorbachev is keenly aware that if he wants to regain Soviet diplomatic influence in the Middle East one price being demanded by Israel is progress on the emigration issue.    Even though action isn't imminent, U.S. business groups that have always opposed Jackson-Vanik restrictions on trade now are adding their voice to the calls for a temporary lifting of the amendment. Margaret Chapman, director of trade programs for the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations, a private group, advocates a one-year or two-year suspension of Jackson-Vanik that would automatically end if emigration doesn't improve dramatically. Some U.S. Jewish leaders also are privately considering a similar form of automatic trigger mechanism.    &quot;Chances are that when overall relations improve, emigration improves,&quot; says Ms. Chapman. &quot;At a time like this, the less we make it coercive, the better off we'll be.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
