Mercer-MeidingerHansen Inc.andP;  (The DATAMATION salary survey covers only those IS professionalsworking within corporations and not those working for outside IS professionalservice companies.)andP;  The salaries of lead OS programmers in the outsidecontractor firms will grow only 1.5% this year, Mercer predicts.andP;  Averagesalaries for entry level OS programmers at these firms are expected to drop22% to $23,700.andP;  &quot;Their skill is simply not in demand,&quot; says Joyce Cain,manager of Mercer's National Survey Group.andP;  Mercer is predicting an average5.8% increase in salaries for professionals in the computer services industryas a whole this year.andM;Manufacturing, Transportation UpandM;A rejuvenation of the nation's manufacturing sector is also revealed by theDATAMATON survey.andP;  Consumer manufacturing, in particular, is now roaring backwith hefty pay increases for IS workers in virtually all categories, butespecially for those with networking know-how.andP;  The task of tying togetherthe various systems serving the shop floor, inventory control and managementfunctions is growing ever more complex, hence the need for people withinter-operability skills.andM;Another big boomer this year is the transportation/utility sector.andP;  And eventhat least automated of industries, construction, is stirring, proving to bea competitive payer in such categories as systems analysis and datamanagement, although not yet in telecommunications.andP;  The financial servicessector (apart from banking) continues to be a sluggish performer and has notyet worked the October 1987 Wall Street crash out of its system.andP;  Expertsthink it will improve in 1990, however.andP;  The medical and legal industriessector has proved to be an erratic performer in past surveys, punishing itsIS pros one year and rewarding them the next.andP;  This year it is expected toturn on them once more.andP;  Other major findings from the survey:andM;* Demand far exceeds supply at both the top and the entry level of the IScareer ladder.andP;  Those in the upper middle section--first- and second-level ISmanagers and senior technicians--can expect a poor return for their skills inthe coming decade, as their areas of expertise become overcrowded.andM;* Systems analysts are outpacing programmer/analysts ana programmers in thequest for big bucks, adding weight to government predictions that systemsanalysis will be one of the nation's top 20 fastest growing occupations inthe 1990s.andM;* Education and retraining have become a top priority for IS organizations.andM;* Corporations are shifting their applications development workload fromin-house to outside contractors, the so-called outsourcing trend.andM;What could be termed a two-tier salary and compensation structure seems to bethe new order at IS shops.andP;  Top IS executives are suddenly in short supplyand so is entry level talent.andP;  Perlin Associates reckons that computerscience graduates from the Class of '89 who are now entering the work forcewill average $26,700 per job, an increase of 10% over last year's startingsalary.andP;  The DATAMATION survey shows that other (noncomputer science) collegegraduates now taking entry level positions at IS organizations should commanda salary in the $25,000 range, whether as junior applications programmers orjunior systems analyst/programmers, up 9% from last year.andM;Competition for entry level talent has grown fierce, as both vendors and ISorganizations compete for a diminishing number of candidates.andM;Senior IS executives are benefiting from being a scarce commodity at present.andO;&quot;Those earning more than $100,000 a year are being offered 25% pay hikes todecamp to other companies right now,&quot; says John J. Davis, principal at JohnJ. Davis andamp; Associates Inc., a New York City consulting firm that searches forhigh-priced IS talent for its corporate clients.andP;  Average salary increases atthe vice president of IS level will be in the 12% range this year, accordingto both the DATAMATION and Perlin surveys.andM;&quot;While everbody is looking for top VP [of IS] executive talent and brightyoungsters at the entry level, there's less demand for what's in the middle,&quot;says Dave Flansbaum, a veteran recruiter of IS professionals.andP;  AddsFlansbaum, who is managing director for the northern California region atnationwide IS recruiter Source EDP in San Francisco, &quot;The middle is beingsqueezed.&quot;andM;Flansbaum calls the people suffering this indignity the &quot;historians&quot; of theprofession.andP;  They are the members of the baby boom generation, men and womenin their 30s and early 40s that manage, modify and maintain existingmainframe- and minicomputer-based systems.andP;  Their careers flourished in the1970s when their companies were getting the first of these machines.andP;  Butover the years, they have become identified with these now-aging code museumsand not with the businesses that employ them.andP;  That has diminished theirmarketability outside their companies.andM;They are the growing residue that didn't make it to the top of the IS careerladder.andP;  Over the years, they have settled into first- and second-levelmanagement positions or became senior technicians.andM;A Psychological BarrierandM;Over the past decade of DATAMATION surveys, the salary of IS vice presidentshas doubled.andP;  The historians have also prospered, with gains in the 60 to 70%range, depending on specialty.andP;  But, over the past three surveys, it's been adifferent story.andP;  Salaries of IS VPs have climbed 20%, and entry levelsalaries have risen 25% over the period.andP;  But managers of such areas asapplications programming and systems analysis--even directors of DP/MIS--haveonly scored 11 to 12% gains over that same period.andM;The new hot position of manager telecom/datacom realized a 16.4% salaryincrease over the same three-year period.andP;  And even the manager of databaseadministration made more than his peers in programming and systems analysison this year's survey.andP;  Senior and lead technicians in the historian groupface an additional challenge, especially in small or midsized companies.andO;&quot;There's a psychological barrier,&quot; says Flansbaum.andP;  &quot;These smaller concernsare reluctant to pay $50,000 and up to anyone that doesn't have the title'manager.'&quot;andM;These historians, especially those with an OS programming oranalyst/programmer speciality, whether managers or technicians, are the biglosers--the only losers--in an otherwise very positive salary survey.andP;  Factorthem out, and the overall average salary increase would climb to around 8%.andM;Systems analysts in demandandM;One group doing well is systems analysts.andP;  &quot;That's because the career pathwe're emphasizing is systems analyst to business analyst,&quot; says MarilynSmith, second vice president and section information officer for the retailinformation services unit of The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.,andO;based in Boston.andP;  Smith says that programmers working in COBOL and otherthird-generation languages will still be around for a long time, but the moveto fourth-generation languages (4GLs) and computer-aided software engineering(CASE) tools is accelerating.andM;&quot;We no longer have any jobs with [the word] programmer in the title,&quot; saysRobert Berger, director of IS at Central Hudson Gas andamp; Electric Corp. inPoughkeepsie, N.Y.andP;  He adds that 95% of all his programming is currently donein 4GLs and that the shift in the industry is to rules-based languages and4GLs made more palatable to nontechnical programmers by an infusion of expertsystem or CASE technology into their structures.andM;The historians are not just the victims of a two-tier salary focus; they, andmaybe the whole classical IS organization, are threatened by another emergingtrend--outsourcing.andP;  IS executives compelled to deliver end solutions, notonly at the right price but with more business know-how than they may haveneeded before, are turning to outsiders.andM;Five years ago, the average number of contract and part-time staff members onthe payroll of the average company was 4.8 persons.andP;  This year, that numberhas grown to 14.1.andP;  Bear in mind that the average number of full-timeemployees per site will this year be around 50, less than it was five yearsago, and you begin to get the picture.andM;As outsourcing accelerates, job turnover is declining at IS organizations,meaning, perhaps, that many of these IS workers will get stuck in humdrumjobs.andP;  To combat this, IS shops are turning with a vengeance to education andretraining.andP;  Last year, the average IS employee was given 107 hours oftraining at an estimated cost of $3,092.andP;  That's a big increase over theprevious mark of 64 hours and $2,800.andM;This year's DATAMATION salary survey also reveals that perks remain animportant method of boosting morale and improving the IS worker's lot.andP;  Butthere has been little change in the types of benefits offered over the years.andO;Perhaps the biggest change over last year is an increase in stock options.andO;These are now available in 23.5%, as opposed to 20%, of cases.andP;  Equity isoften a lure to IS talent joining software companies or new technologyventures.andM;I'll Take ManhattaanandM;Corporations will continue to offer exotic locations to the talent they mostprize.andP;  But Source EDP's Flansbaum warns that regional differences insalaries aren't as sharp as they once were.andP;  &quot;You should move to the SanFrancisco Bay area because you want to live there, not because teh salariesseem higher.andP;  Factor in the cost of living, and you're no better off than ifyou were in Houston or Detroit,&quot; he says.andP;  A glance at salaries by regionreveals that, as expected, Los Angeles and Manhattan are the big payers.andP;  TheEast Coast offers higher salaries to high-level corporate staffers.andP;  The WestCoast is better for most other categories.andM;In any event, IS professionals in search of top salaries must always choosetheir indutries with great care.andP;  Across the board, ISers in the field ofeducation earn considerably less than average; those intransportation/utilities, manufacturing, electronic data processing servicesand financial services, considerably more.andM;The odds are, however, that in whichever industry or region IS workers findthemselves this year, they'll be better paid than the typical U.S.andP;  worker.andO;Nonagricultural workers employed by private industry in the United Statesearn less than $18,000 a year on average.andP;  Only one of the 49 job categoriesin the DATAMATION survey--data entry operator ($17,431)--reported a meansalary of less than $18,000.andP;  While it's true that IS workers are threatenedby outsourcing and other perils, for this year, at least, they're stillaboard the gravy train.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
