Since this gas release is greater thanthat caused by thermal desorption, the design and performance of thevacuum system of an electron storage ring is largely different from thoseof other accelerators. Gas release in most cases is expressed in termsof photodesorption yield eta (molecules-photon), which is independentof the evacuation rate or the number of photons (beam current). In thisreport, the quantity eta is discussed in relation to measurements ofpressure changes in an electron storage ring and the 'weathering' ofan electron storage ring is investigated. Results are used to examinethe 'cold bore system under strong synchrotron radiation' which is plannedto be installed with the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in theU.S. The 'weathering' is shown to increase at a rate proportional tothe evacuation rate, or the rate of removing gaseous molecules out ofthe system. These analyses and considerations lead to the conclusionthat it is indispensable to use a rake-out type pump in combination witha cryopump. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
