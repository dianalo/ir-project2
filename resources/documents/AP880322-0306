Platinum broke through a barrier at $510 a troy ounce, climbing$7.70 to $8.30 higher with the contract for March delivery settlingat $510.40.   On other markets, petroleum futures prices finished mostlyhigher in volatile trading; wheat and soybean futures prices werehigher, but corn slipped slightly; and livestock and meat futuresprices were higher across the board.   ``Platinum is a good indicator of inflationary sentiment,because it's a precious metal and an industrial metal,'' said JackBarbanel, analyst with Gruntal andamp; Co., New York. ``It's a hedge, butit's also affected by fundamentals.   ``Some of (Tuesday's) rise is the whiff of inflation sometraders are picking up on. But you can discount $3 or $4 of the $7(advance) to South Africa,'' he added. ``We're beginning to seemsome political unrest and that makes people nervous.''   South Africa provides nearly all of the West's platinum, whichhas industrial applications as varied as X-ray scanning equipmentand catalytic converters for autos.   A nationwide strike Monday marking the 28th anniversary of theSharpeville Massacre was honored by as many as 90 percent of theworkers in the Indian Ocean city of Port Elizabeth.

Gold did not join the runup, finishing 50 cents to $1.60 centslower with March at $448.70 a troy ounce on the New York CommodityExchange; silver was 1.5 cents to 1.8 cents higher, with March at646.5 cents a troy ounce.   Petroleum futures finished mixed after another volatile day NewYork Mercantile Exchange.   Reports that OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman would _ and thenwould not _ hold a news conference to unveil price-stabilizingmeasures brought wild swings Monday. The same reports pressuredTuesday's opening and may have sparked a surge at the close.   ``The same things that played havoc yesterday was responsiblefor today's games as well,'' said Nauman Barakat, energy futuresanalyst with Smith Barney Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York.

After Tuesday's close of business, the American PetroleumInstitute's weekly distillate report was generally construed asslightly bearish for crude.   Support for wheat and soybeans at the Chicago Board of Tradecame soon after the open when Monday's big player, Candamp;D Commodities,began buying again.   Candamp;D's buying didn't match Monday's levels _ the Chicago-basedhouse bought 20 million bushels of beans the previous day, comparedto just 4 million Tuesday.
