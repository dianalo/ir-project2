(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson told striking workers onSunday he will push hard to get his ``workers' bill of rights''included in the Democratic Party platform. And he criticized rivalMichael Dukakis on economics and the fight against drugs.   Neither Dukakis nor George Bush, the certain GOP nominee,campaigned on Sunday.   Jackson, campaigning for California's June 7 primary, toldstriking workers they were victims of ``economic violence,'' saidthe party must adopt his 10-point plan for ``democracy in theworkplace.''   That plan, which Jackson has presented at previous laborrallies, addresses matters such as a woman's right to pregnancyleave and guarantees of a safe workplace.   ``You deserve a living wage. You deserve job security. Youdeserve respect,'' Jackson told about 1,000 members and supportersof Teamsters Joint Council 8.   The workers have been on strike against United Foods Inc., afrozen foods firm, for 11 months.   The Democratic Party ``must stand with the working people. It'sthe legacy of (President Franklin) Roosevelt. It's the unfinishedbusiness of Dr. (Martin Luther) King,'' Jackson said.   ``Today I'm fighting for a working people's platform,'' Jacksonsaid. ``I want a mandate from you as I take your case to Atlantaand to the White House.''   Jackson was referring to the Democratic National Convention inAtlanta, which begins July 18. As his prospects for winning thenomination become increasingly remote, Jackson has been stressinghis expected impact on the party platform.   ``When I win, workers win,'' Jackson told the crowd.   He also renewed his criticism of Dukakis, who is heavily favoredto win the California contest, garnering enough delegates to assurehim the nomination.   Dukakis' economic plans, Jackson said, are ``very conservative,very cautious, very inadequate.''   Jackson also sought to contrast his own policies with those ofDukakis.   ``I've made the fight against drugs the No. 1 issue of thecampaign. Dukakis is against drugs now, but he has no plan. I havea commitment to fight a war against drugs.''   Later, in the coastal resort and college community of SantaCruz, Jackson performed the marriage vows for Jim Monday andRebecca Steen, daughter of hostage Alann Steen, and then introducedthe newlyweds at a campaign rally where he pledged to work forSteen's release.   ``We will not rest until all the hostages are set free. We willnot rest until the whole Middle East is set free, because the wholeMiddle East is held hostage,'' Jackson said.   Steen was taken hostage in Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987.   Dukakis, meanwhile, was home in Massachusetts, where hededicated a memorial to a local politican and friend, Allan Sidd,who died 11 years ago.   ``He loved politics. He loved being involved,'' Dukakis said ofSidd as he dedicated a sundial in a hilltop park in Brookline,where the governor lives.   The governor reminisced about Sidd's help in his first forayinto elective politics, on Brookline's Democratic town committee,back in the 1960s.   Dukakis returned home from California on Saturday night. Heplanned to spend Monday at the statehouse and campaign Monday nightin New Jersey, which like California holds its primary June 7.   Dukakis was scheduled to campaign in California later this week.   Later, in the coastal resort and college community of SantaCruz, Jackson performed the marriage vows for Jim Monday andRebecca Steen, daughter of hostage Alann Steen, and then introducedthe newlyweds at a campaign rally where he pledged to work forSteen's release.   ``We will not rest until all the hostages are set free. We willnot rest until the whole Middle East is set free, because the wholeMiddle East is held hostage,'' Jackson said.   Steen was taken hostage in Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
