(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fire feeding on thousands of gallons ofoil at a suburban Milwaukee oil-packing company destroyed the plantTuesday and raged out of control for seven hours until a foam spraycut the flames.   The fire broke out shortly after 4 a.m. at Harrison Oil Corp. Noworkers were inside at the time, and no injuries were reported. Onefirefighter was overcome by fumes and heat, and another gashed hisface when he fell.   Plant Manager Gil Dombek said nearly all of the 50,000 to100,000 gallons of outboard motor oil and 2,000 to 3,000 gallons ofkerosene were engulfed in the blaze. He also said 150 gallons of acattle insecticide were believed to have burned and could haveproduced toxic fumes earlier in the morning.   ``But beyond that, really, there shouldn't be that much toxic inthere,'' Dombek said.   Firefighters were unable to control the fire until a specializedtruck from Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport wasdispatched and sprayed thousands of gallons of foam on the flames,said Glendale Fire Chief Norman Wichman.   ``The foam did a fabulous job. It really cut the fire,'' Wichmansaid.   A huge plume of smoke that billowed from the plant closed amanufacturer, two schools and a portion of Interstate 43.   State Department of Natural Resources officials said an unknownquantity of oil, anti-flame foam and insecticides seeped into theMilwaukee River, and might kill fish and waterfowl there.</TEXT></DOC>
