Gets NASA Contract </HL><SO> </SO><CO> ML GOVMT </CO><IN> ARO </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it awarded a $496.1 million contract to Martin Marietta Corp. to perform preparatory work on 60 new space-shuttle external fuel tanks.    NASA said the contract covered the material, subcontracts and labor -- including work dating back to 1984 -- required prior to manufacturing the tanks themselves. The space agency said it would award a separate contract in December 1988 to make the tanks. Martin Marietta is the incumbent contractor for both the pre-production and manufacturing contracts.    NASA said it has about two dozen external tanks on hand and expects to receive another dozen under its current contract. The space agency said it expects to receive the first external tanks under the new contract in 1991. The 154-foot-long fuel tank holds 528,000 gallons of liquid propellants that fuel the shuttle orbiter's three main engines.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Martin Marietta closed at $41.25 a share, down 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
