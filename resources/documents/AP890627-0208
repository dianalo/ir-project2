In a statement, he branded as intolerable their purportedinvolvement in the May 30, 1984, death of columnist Manuel Buendia.   He said the order to disband the Intelligence Division of MexicoCity Police because of the Buendia case and ``other crimes'' waseffective at once.   The brief statement gave no details.   Commanders Juventino Prado Hurtado, Sofia Naya Suarez and RaulPerez Carmona were charged over the weekend with Buendia's murder.All three said they were tortured into confessing.   Authorities say the men acted on orders of Jose Antonio ZorrillaPerez, then head of the Federal Security Administration. All threeserved as officers under Zorrilla in the agency, which was theMexican equivalent of the FBI but was disbanded for corruption in1985.   Zorrilla, 47, is under indictment as having mastermindedBuendia's murder. He faces other charges, including obstructingjustice and abuse of authority.   Authorities say Zorrilla feared that Buendia would expose hislucrative links with Mexican narcotics kingpins.   Zorrilla denies ordering Buendia's death.   The intelligence police have been under fire by human rightsactivists, public officials and the press since the unit was createdlate last year as part of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari'scrime-fighting program.   The first commander, Miguel Nazar Haro, is wanted in San Diego ona 1982 U.S. indictment alleging he was part of an auto theft andauto smuggling ring.   The unit also was assailed for its role in quelling a prison riotin Tepic, 500 miles from Mexico City. A videotape viewed by TheAssociated Press indicated that six prisoners who surrendered werelater shot.   Repeated demands were made in the Federal District Assembly, thecapital's equivalent of a city council, for disbanding the unit,which was accused of illegal detentions, torture and extortion.   In March, intelligence agents were accused of detaining ninewomen coming home from an illegal abortion clinic. The women saidthey were beaten and their elderly doctor was tortured before theywere released without charge 14 hours later.   Police and city officials refused to discuss the incident butthey closed down the intelligence police's notorious detentioncenter, Tlaxcoaque, in April.   Reps. Victor Orduna, chairman of the Justice AdministrationCommittee of the Federal District Assembly, and Ramon Sosamontes,chairman of the Public Safety Committee, and human rights groupstold the AP the intelligence police have been using four otherlocations as clandestine jails since then.</TEXT></DOC>
