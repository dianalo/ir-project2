Berkman, a physician who already is serving 12 years for illegalpossession of explosives and weapons, then referred to the wall ofbulletproof plastic that separated the court from spectators andsaid, ``There is no legitimate security concern to account for thatPlexiglas screen in the courtoom.''   Lead defense counsel Susan Tipograph complained that thedefendants had been unable to meet privately with lawyers to conferabout the case. She also said that the defendants were forced towear handcuffs and leg irons while meeting with lawyers.   She refused to discuss a schedule for pretrial motions until thedefendants had a chance to meet and discuss hiring permanentlawyers for the case.   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene said that he would makesure the defendants were allowed to meet together and conferwithout being overheard by jail guards.   But Greene said he would not interfere with other securityprecautions taken against the defendants, who were already incustody on other charges before the indictment was unsealed on May11.   The judge, who gave the defendants 30 days to hire lawyers,expressed frustration with the lengthy speeches.   ``We're not going to have a mass meeting,'' Greene said. ``Ifyou want to give vent to your exasperation, I can't help that.''   At one point, Greene said: ``I'm getting sick of this.''   Each of the six defendants pleaded innocent to the charges,identifying themselves as ``anti-imperialist'' political prisoners.   Marilyn Buck, Linda Sue Evans and Laura Whitehorn are chargedwith conspiring to set off bombs in the Capitol and seven otherlocations in New York City and Washington as part of a campaign of``armed propaganda'' against U.S. foreign policy.   They are charged along with Berkman, Timothy Blunk, SusanRosenberg and Elizabeth Duke, a fugitive, with maliciousdestruction of property in connection with the bombings at theCapitol and three military buildings in Washington in 1983 and 1984.   None of the blasts caused any injuries.   The Nov. 7, 1983, explosion outside the Senate chamber blew thedoors off hinges outside the offices of Senate Democratic LeaderRobert Byrd of West Virginia, damaged five paintings and knockeddown a wall.   ``I am a political prisoner, not a terrorist,'' said Buck, 40,who faces a life sentence following her conviction in New Yorkearlier this month of participating in two 1981 Brink's armored carrobberies that left four people dead.   The indictment charges that the defendants are members of asecret communist organization that plotted ``to oppose, obstruct orchange the foreign and domestic policies of the U.S. governmentthrough violent and illegal means.''   Five of the six defendants in court Wednesday already areserving sentences for various federal weapons charges. Whitehornrecently completed a two-year term for making a false statement ona passport application. She is in custody awaiting trial inBaltimore on federal weapons charges.   Greene ordered her held without bail after Assistant U.S.Attorney Margaret Ellen described how Whitehorn hit an FBI agentwhile resisting arrest in Baltimore in 1985.   Outside the U.S. Courthouse, relatives of the defendants issueda statement accusing the goverment of trying to silence dissent.``The Justice Department and the FBI are making a spectacle of thiscase to show what the government will do if you dare to opposeit,'' the group said in a statement.   Dr. Barbara Zeller, Berkman's wife, said the courtroom securitywas ``an enormous show of power of the U.S. government. They aretrying to intimidate serious dissent. They are trying to intimidatethe defendants.''   Bella Rosenberg said that she was shocked to learn that herdaughter was being held in a psychiatric observation unit at theDistrict of Columbia Jail.   ``There has never been any question about her mental oremotional stability,'' Mrs. Rosenberg said. ``She has always been amodel prisoner.''   Susan Rosenberg, 32, and Blunk, 30, are serving 58-yearsentences for possession of 600 pounds of explosives found whenthey were arrested in Cherry Hill, N.J., nearly three years ago.   The indictment charged that after each bombing, the defendantsclaimed credit for the blasts under the names of various groupssuch as the Armed Resistance Unit, the Revolutionary Fighting Groupand the Red Guerrilla Resistance.   The groups also claimed responsibility for bombs set off at fourlocations in New York City between 1983 and 1985, the indictmentcharged.   The blasts were set to protest various U.S. foreign policiestoward the Middle East and Central America.</TEXT></DOC>
