Naturally the alternativeenergy industry was abuzz with concern and worries about its future.Nervous bankers, customers and developers stuck their fingers into thewind to assess the situation. With this backdrop, the title of this paperwould be quite appropriate. But, the title of this paper was not selectedbecause of a presumption of a positive answer to the question posed,but rather to highlight the extremes of conjecture which seem to runrampant in an industry which the author believes is here to stay. Inperspective, the author must remember that the alternative energy industry,which includes such non-traditional sources of energy as cogeneration,biomass, geothermal, hydropower, wind, and solar, was born out of theenergy crisis of the 1970's. The National Energy Act of 1978 establisheda new class of independent power producers which were exempt from regulationas electric utilities provided they employed non-traditional methodsof producing electricity either by cogeneration or from renewable resources.From the beginning there were numerous challenges to this new law, PURPA,the most notable being finally reviewed by the Supreme Court in 1983.While PURPA was declared lawful, the process delayed many early developments,as well as state commission implementing actions, because of the uncertainlycreated by the challenges. The 2nd round of sharp oil increases of theearly 80's also caused a crisis of concern in the alternative energyindustry, as did the ALCON decision in the fall of 1986, tax reform thisfall and other actions having impact on the business.</TEXT></DOC>
