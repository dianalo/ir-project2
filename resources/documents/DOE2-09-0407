Unknown substances in the wastewater reduced the flotationefficiency of the metal sulfides. The tests indicated that aeration ortreatment with activated carbon significantly improved the water quality.The improvements in molybdenum recovery averaged 8 pct for aeration,11 pct for activated carbon, and 16 pct for combined aeration and activatedcarbon. The combination of the two processes produced water quality asgood as or better than that of normal feed water.</TEXT></DOC>
