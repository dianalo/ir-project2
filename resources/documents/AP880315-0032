KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State George P. Shultz says thatseven weeks of Senate testimony have produced nothing to bar thespeedy ratification of the new arms reduction treaty with theSoviet Union.   Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee onMonday, Shultz angrily dismissed an allegation by Sen. Jesse Helms,R-N.C., that the administration's public defense of the pact isbased on ``misrepresentation'' and is at odds with facts presentedin closed-door secret sessions.   Shultz also said the Senate should firmly discard all proposedamendments or reservations to the treaty, including one that wouldtie its implementation to reversing Soviet superiority inconventional arms in Europe.   He ticked off objections that have been mounted to the terms ofthe pact, which bans medium-range nuclear missiles, and assertedthat all those objections have been refuted.   The secretary of state, whose testimony opened the committee'sexamination of the treaty in January, commented as he made a returnappearance to offer a summing up.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Senate's deputy majorityleader and a respected vote counter, predicted that the pact willbe ratified by the full Senate by a margin far greater than therequired two-thirds majority.   Cranston said the Senate will act well in advance of a plannedMoscow summit meeting this spring between President Reagan andSoviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``We believe the treaty stands on its merits,'' Shultz said.``It is self-contained and should not be made a vehicle forstatements on other issues,'' including the Soviet militaryoccupation of Afghanistan.   But he bristled after hearing Helms declare that there is ``awide gap between the administration's public representations aboutthe treaty and the information which we have received in closedsession.''   ``Indeed,'' Helms said, ``after many hours of listening totestimony both private and public, the administration's publicpresentation of the treaty has been a tissue of confusion,misstatements and _ and I use the word advisedly _ evenmisrepresentations.''   Shultz told Helms: ``In a sense I don't know what I'm doinghere. Are you sitting here accusing me of deliberatelymisrepresenting? ... I can handle it fine when people say theydon't agree with me, but when they say I have misrepresented, Ihave trouble with that.''   Helms said he was not accusing Shultz of ``deliberately''misrepresenting, but he added that ``the contradictions areself-apparent.''   Replying to questions, Shultz told Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D.,that Senate passage of an amendment delaying implementation of thetreaty until the West achieved a balance with the Soviet Union inconventional arms would kill the pact.   The pact, formally termed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forcesor INF treaty, calls for the destruction of all nuclear missileswith a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.   Shultz said he does not believe the treaty will cause WestGermany to demand the removal of all nuclear weapons from its soil_ a step that some fear could open Europe to intimidation by theSoviet Union, which is said to have superiority in conventional,non-nuclear forces.</TEXT></DOC>
