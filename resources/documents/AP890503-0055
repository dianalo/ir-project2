ROWE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Ah, it's spring again, and college students' fancies are turningto protests even as final exams loom.   In at least four states, echoes of the '60s could be heard asstudents took aim at proposed budget cuts, tuition increases andunion recognition.   And at a prestigious college, student protests culminated ingetting Coca-Cola products banned.   Thousands of protesting City University of New York studentsskipped classes Tuesday and marched through lower Manhattan as adeadline approached on a state spending bill that would reducemoney for higher education and force a tuition increase. Hourslater, Gov. Mario Cuomo vetoed the bill.   At the University of California, Berkeley, teaching and researchassistants planned to begin a two-day walkout today and picketcampus entrances to protest the school's refusal to recognize theirunion.   Mount Holyoke College administrators in South Hadley, Mass.,under pressure from students to boycott Coca-Cola products becauseof the company's ties to South Africa, announced a monthlong ban ofthe company's soft drinks.   In New York, about 4,000 students stepped up protests that beganlast week.   Placard-carrying, chanting students from the university systemassembled in front of the World Trade Center, where Cuomo's NewYork office is located. They blocked traffic for several hours,then paraded past City Hall and to the Wall Street financialdistrict.   ``It's not just a matter of this tuition hike. If we let themgo, it will be more,'' said Armando Howard, a 29-year-old physicsstudent. ``It will cut out the opportunity for people to rise.''   Cuomo had given no indication what his decision would be. Butone hour before the midnight deadline, he vetoed it, sayinguniversity officials had failed to prove the need for the extramoney.   At Berkeley, neither the 3,200-member Association of GraduateStudent Employees nor university officials would predict how manyassistants would join today's walkout.   ``So far, our indications are that this could be more symbolicthan a significant disruption,'' said university spokesman TomDebley.   The dispute is over the university's view that the assistants'work cannot be considered employment because it is so intertwinedwith educational experience, said Debley. Assistants receive annualstipends from the university or research institutions averagingabout $10,000.   The association has been seeking recognition since 1983 as aunion so it can negotiate better pay and benefits and improvedworking conditions. But the Public Employment Relations Boardrecently ruled students do not have to be considered employees forthe purposes of collective bargaining.   The association is appealing the decision.   In Ohio, a two-day commemoration was to begin tonight at KentState University to mark the May 4, 1970, shooting deaths of fourstudents by National Guardsmen during an anti-Vietnam Wardemonstration.   At Mount Holyoke, a memo to students today outlined immediatesteps to replace Coca-Cola products with beverages from companieswith little or no business interests in South Africa.   The decision came Tuesday after 60 protesters shouted anti-Cokeslogans outside school President Elizabeth Kennan's office andchased a Coke delivery truck down the street.   Students have pressed administrators for two months to removeCoca-Cola products because, they say, the company is reapingprofits that benefit white-ruled South Africa.   ``I think it's a monumental step. I think it shows someresponsibility on the part of the administration in terms oflistening to students,'' said Kuhusu Wanzu of the the AmericanFriends Service Committee in Atlanta, the Quaker group that hastried to organize boycotts at several campuses.   A Coca-Cola spokesman in Atlanta called the students misguidedand quoted from a letter by South Africa's Anglican ArchbishopDesmond Tutu, an anti-apartheid leader.   ``I am sorry to hear that Coca-Cola is ... being accused ofaiding and abetting the apartheid regime,'' Tutu said in the April10 letter, according to Coca-Cola spokesman Mark Preisinger.``Nothing could be further from the truth.''   Tutu continued: ``It is easy to sound more radical from the safeand comfortable distance of 10,000 miles than those who bear thebrunt of the viciousness of the apartheid machinery close at hand.''</TEXT></DOC>
