Union leaders and the company agreed last month on contract termsto end a weeklong strike that began May 15. Balloting by localmembers completed Sunday night assured ratification, said unionspokesman Curt Brown.   Ninety-five percent of the members of Local 7 in Akron and 90percent of the members of Local 138 in Noblesville, Ind., votedSunday in favor of the contract, Brown said. The locals were thelast to vote on the pact, and the results assured the contract'sratification, he said.   In other balloting over the past 10 days, workers at Des Moines,Iowa; Decatur, Ill., and Russellville, Ark., approved the pact. Theonly rejection vote came from workers in Oklahoma City.   A URW contract must win approval both by a majority of the localsand by a majority of the members it covers, Brown said. TheFirestone contract covers 4,700 members, he said.   ``I feel the agreement will afford protection for these membersduring the next three years and does offer the possibility of a wagereopener in the third year,'' said Milan ``Mike'' Stone, URWinternational president, in a statement after the Akron andNoblesville votes.   Brown said the contract's strengths include good health andretirement benefits and protection against inflation.   An average Firestone worker at the six plants earns $12.50 anhour, according to the union. The proposed contract with Firestonewould provide a 25-cent-an-hour increase, but it would be consideredan advance to be deducted from future cost-of-living raises inincrements of no more than 10 cents a year. The cost-of-livingallowances were retroactive to May 23, Brown said.   He said increases in both salary and benefits over the life ofthe contract could amount to as much as $4 an hour.   ``Right now, our average is just a little below what is theaverage for the industry and this should help that,'' Brown said.   Firestone workers' average earnings were lower, he said, becauseof concessions made by workers at the Oklahoma City and Des Moinesplants.</TEXT></DOC>
