Such maneuvers could produce a bonanza for junk-bondholders, and they may even leave many shareholders feelingpleased, after an initial jolt.</LP><TEXT>   A popular game among junk-bond investors now is to betwhich companies will swap new stock for old high-cost debt,making themselves financially healthier. The goal is to findthe next McCaw Cellular Communications, a company whose bondssoared after it divulged plans to offer new stock in exchangefor as much as $600 million face amount of junk.   In the short run, of course, such swaps tend to be betterfor bondholders than for current shareholders, whose stake ina company shrinks when extra shares are issued. But stockinvestors lately have seemed willing to overlook the dilutionin some cases where a big reduction in debt can be achieved.McCaw's shares initially fell when the company recentlyannounced plans to swap stock for its 12.95% junk bonds,representing about 17% of total debt. But the stock soonrebounded.   &quot;When you've got bonds trading at a discount and a strongstock, like McCaw, it's a real good play&quot; for all investors,says money manager Gerald Unterman, who runs Cypress CapitalManagement in New York. Recently, he has been buying bonds ofcompanies &quot;that have the flexibility&quot; to do swaps or stocksales.   Such companies have plenty of incentive. With the stockmarket booming, companies that piled up debt and slashedtheir equity in the 1980s now can partly reverse pastexcesses. They can retire securities having high interestrates or short maturities -- often at discounts to facevalue. And instead of paying cash for their bonds, they canoffer bondholders common shares that don't have to beredeemed and needn't pay any dividends. In the long run,everybody gains, because companies with less debt can copebetter with any setbacks.   &quot;During the 1980s, people made money buying stocks beforecompanies levered up. In the 1990s, they're making superbreturns by buying debt of companies before they de-lever,&quot;says Robert Long, who runs First Boston's junk bond research.   Speculators are bidding up bond prices among seemingcandidates for swaps, bond buy-backs or stock offerings,including Dr Pepper, Duracell Holdings, StorerCommunications, Stone Container and Time Warner (which has alot of high-cost preferred shares.) Currently, Kroger Co. issoliciting investors in the private placement market for someconvertible securities. Duracell recently said it expects toget permission from its bankers to buy back junk; someinvestors expect that company to go public in a year or so.   RJR Nabisco's recent swap offer for $1.18 billion ofcostly 17% bonds has sent some of the company's junkrocketing 50% since December. The swap offer was heavilyoversubscribed; the company accepted 43% of the bondstendered in the offer, which expired Friday. Meanwhile RJR'snewly issued stock, trading in recent weeks on a &quot;whenissued&quot; basis, has climbed to 9 3/4 from 5 1/2.   &quot;RJR is the classic `everybody's a winner' situation,&quot;says New York money manager John Gordon of Deltec Securities.He owns some RJR bonds that aren't involved in the swap, andeven those have climbed about 35%.   So far this year, junk bonds have already racked upreturns of around 12%, according to First Boston's High YieldIndex. Much of the profit has come from RJR's bonds, a largepart of the index, and from announced or rumored bond swapsor purchases involving other debt-ridden companies, saysFirst Boston's Mr. Long.   Some swap candidates already have shares trading in thepublic market. Others, including Container Corp. of Americaand Duracell, are wholly owned by leveraged-buyout firms andprivate investors who might want to cash in some sharesthrough a public stock sale. The likeliest candidates for aswap or stock sale are companies that badly want or need tocut debt. But a company also should have enough pizzazz totempt people to take the shares. Bulls envision dizzyinggrowth for McCaw's cellular-telephone service. And thecompany's operations should be improving; Duracell'sbatteries are doing well.   Although the rising stock market has certainly smoothedthe way for stock-for-debt swaps, it has at the same timerestrained the bondholders' potential profit. The higher acompany's stock soars, the fewer shares it must issue toretire each bond. (Many companies are trying to do swaps inbankruptcy court; investors' profits there can be veryelusive.)   Debt-for-stock swaps may prove more popular with investorsthan outright stock sales, especially if a company is partlyowned by an LBO firm. Says Deltec's Mr. Gordon: &quot;There'salways been a slight suspicion that a {stock sale} for an LBOwas bailing out the LBO group at a high price and foistingthe securities on the public.&quot;   He thinks RJR's swap was &quot;ingenious&quot; because the company'sbig shareholders at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &quot;are notexplicitly asking people to pony up any money to buy shares.&quot;Mr. Gordon says he &quot;would just as soon not make Henry Kravisany richer&quot; by paying high cash prices for RJR shares.   Some swap candidates could disappoint investors. Topexecutives who own big stakes in Stone Container, GoldenNuggett and Viacom Inc. might resist having their ownershipdiluted if they can find another way to cut debt, tradersspeculate.   Moreover, many companies that badly need to cut debtaren't faring well, and might find takers for their stockonly by twisting people's arms, in or out of bankruptcycourt. In this class, investors put Itel Corp., which hasbeen buying back some of its own shares; Federated DepartmentStores, and Grand Union.   &quot;For some companies, it would be a stretch&quot; to do a swap,says Mr. Long. &quot;But bull markets do amazing things.&quot;   ---                    More Stock Coming?
