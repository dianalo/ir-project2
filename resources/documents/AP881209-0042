They said at least one Israeli soldier was killed and two otherswounded in a clash between the Israeli landing party and guerrillasof a pro-Syrian Palestinian faction and a leftist Lebanese group.   ``Other Israeli troops have been captured, but we do not knowtheir number yet. It seems the Israelis are surrounded,'' said apolice officer in Naameh. He cannot be named under standing rules.   There was no immediate confirmation from Israel's militarycommand, which usually issues its communiques only after itsoperation has been completed.   Gunboats cruised off Naameh as five helicopter gunships hoveredoverhead, apparently waiting to evacuate the Israeli commandos wholanded on Naameh's bluffs at 2:10 a.m., the spokesman said.   Eight fighter-bombers thundered in from the clear Mediterraneansky at dayrteak to blast hilltop targets east of Naameh in 15bombing sorties, police said.   ``They are attacking roughly at 15-minute intervals, obviouslytrying to help break the noose around their trapped paratroopers inthe Naameh hills,'' the spokesman said.   The assault began at 6:40 a.m. Black smoke billowed from strickentargets perched in olive groves above Naameh, police said.   Naameh is nine miles south of Beirut and 16 miles north of Sidon,provincial capital of south Lebanon. Ambulances were dispatched fromboth cities after the attack.   The area is controlled by the Syrian-backed Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine-General Command and leftist militiamen ofDruse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party.   Many cars were seen speeding out with honking horns from thestricken bluffs to the coastal highway linking Beirut and Sidon.They were believed rushing casualties to hospitals in both cities.   Distant thuds of explosions could be heard in Beirut as theplanes staged Israel's 24th air raid on Lebanon this year.   Fighters of the Popular Front and their Druse allies unleashed ascreen of shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles, known as Strellas, againstthe raiding jets, but no hits were scored, police said.   They said Israeli pilots released hot air balloons to deflect theheat-seeking missiles.   The Popular Front, headed by former Syrian Army Capt. AhmedJibril, is armed by Syria and funded by Libya. It is at odds withYasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine Liberation Organiztion.   Dozens of guerrillas and militiamen, all toting shoulder-firedrocket- propelled grenades were seen running to positions alongNaameh's beach as five Israeli helicopter gunships hovered oppositethe coastal town at 8:15 a.m.   ``They're going to land troops,'' one guerrilla was heardshouting as he raced to the beachstrip.   Panicky shopkeepers hurriedly lowered their shutters as hundredsof Naameh residents scurried to take shelter in basements.   At least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in Israel's 23previous air raids on Lebanon since Jan. 3.</TEXT></DOC>
