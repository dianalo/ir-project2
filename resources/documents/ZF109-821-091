 These applications tend to be highlycustomized and are frequently aimed at particular vertical industries.andP;  Theyalso tend to be very complex, with multimedia being only one of the elements,which may also include databases, expert systems, imaging, and groupconferencing.andM;These applications can range from personal productivity for financialtraders, multimedia conferencing among doctors, and assistance in finding aproperty for real estate buyers.andM;TRADER'S WORKSTATION.andP;  Key early adopters of advanced technologies are thefinancial or commodities traders.andP;  Because of the highly leveraged work theydo, where a single decision could affect millions of dollars, they arelargely receptive of technology that assists in information-gathering anddecision-making.andP;  Thus, this market segment has been among the first to adoptworkstations, which have multiwindowing capabilities to simplify what thetrader sees and can integrate the various data sources with powerfulworkstation analysis tools.andM;The story is similar with the introduction of multimedia technologies.andP;  Someof the multiple windows are now being used for live video feeds from CNN,FNN, and other information sources.andP;  In addition, voice annotation is usedboth for increased personal productivity--as personal reminders--and to passinformation to colleagues.andP;  The latter is particularly necessary with24-hour-per-day trading.andP;  At the end of each trader's shift, he or she must&quot;pass the book&quot; to the person responsible for the accounts during thetrader's off hours.andM;NYNEX PROMOTES WORKGROUP MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS.andP;  NYNEX has embarked on anaggressive program to develop and demonstrate the possibilities of using thephone network to create advanced multimedia, imaging, workgroup applicationswithin metropolitan and wide area networks.andP;  The first result is adevelopment agreement among NYNEX, Sun Microsystems, and four Boston-basedhospitals to develop a system that connects health care professionals atvarious locations.andP;  This allows them to work together while simultaneouslyviewing the same medical data--including still medical images (such asx-rays) and moving images such as sonograms and MRI (Magnetic ResonanceImaging).andM;This is part of a three-year trial of what NYNEX is terming the world's firstmultimedia conferencing service known as Media Broadband Service (MBS).andP;  Theother participants in the trial are Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children'sHospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and New England Medical Center.andM;Applications being developed include the following:andM;* At Brigham and Women's Hospital, hospital personnel treating an emergencypatient will be able to send information to a doctor at home--includingx-rays and patient history--so that the doctor can specify treatment beforeleaving for the hospital.andM;* At Children's Hospital, medical personnel will create and share multimediapackages of images, data, text, and voice annotations to be used as patientreports.andP;  These reports will be able to be viewed simultaneously andannotated by imaging specialists, referring physicians, and hospital staff.andO;If the appropriate people are not available on site, the reports will beelectronically mailed to the appropriate experts.andM;* At Mass General, Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), whichenables the transmission, archiving, and manipulation of radiological imageswithin the hospital's main campus, has been in use for the past five years.andO;With the new service, it will be possible for personnel located in hospitalbuildings in Boston and the neighboring cities of Charlestown and Somervilleto view images simultaneously.andM;* At New England Medical Center, a cardiologist at the hospital and areferring physician at a suburban hospital will simultaneously view movingimages of a patient's heart catheterization and decide together on anappropriate course of action.andM;In addition to these medical applications, NYNEX is working with theChristian Science Publishing Society--publisher of the Christian ScienceMonitor and the Christian Science television and radio broadcast networks--toenable remote layout and editing of the print publications, and to movepictures between the print and broadcast media easily.andM;The front ends of many of these applications will be built on Sunworkstations.andP;  In addition, Unix servers are used on the network to handlethe routing, session management, and security on the network.andP;  The networkconsists of broadband switches and dedicated fiber lines running among thehospitals and publisher and the New England Telephone central offices.andP;  Thistraffic will use the new Switched Multimegabit Data Services (SMDS) when itbecomes available.andP;  Within the local networks, both Ethernet and FDDI are inuse.andM;For NYNEX, these trials will help establish SMDS as the method for businessesto easily send and receive voice, data, images, and video, individually or incombination.andP;  Ultimately, however, NYNEX and all of the regional operatingcompanies are looking at the vast consumer/entertainment market.andP;  In the verypress release announcing the MBS trial, it is noted that SMDS &quot;could allowresidents to choose any video entertainment they want to view and when theywant to view it.&quot;andM;INFORMIX SHOWS POINT-OF-INFORMATION APPLICATION.andP;  Informix is demonstratinghow multi-media and database technology can be used together to create apoint-of-information application, in this case in the real estate business.andO;The application runs as follows:andM;A customer (more likely, a couple) comes into a real estate office with someidea of the type of house desired.andP;  The significant details--price, style,number of bedrooms, school district, etc.--are entered into a form thatcreates a query on a relational database.andP;  The query returns a number ofhouses that meet the criteria, with a picture of each house appearing on theworkstation screen.andM;The user can then look at the pictures and choose which ones to get morespecific information about, or the user can click on a video button and get avideo walk-though tour of the house.andM;In this particular application, the video is stored on a laser disk connectedto the workstation.andP;  With compression such as Digital Video Interactive(DVI), the video could be stored on CD-ROM or transmitted across a network.andO;As compression technology gets better, the video itself will be stored in thedatabase.andM;Point-of-information applications are one of the hot prospects formultimedia, with travel services being one of the chief targets.andP;  Technologysimilar to the Informix real estate application will enable prospectivetravelers to &quot;walk though&quot; cruise ships (including the pools, lounges, andcasinos), view a hotel's rooms and its location in a city, and compare thewhiteness of resort beaches.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
