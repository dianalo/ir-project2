Speaking nine days before his retirement to California, Reagansaid, ``the fact is parting is such sweet sorrow.'' He reflected onthe modern presidency, ``You're always somewhat apart. You spendalot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving.''   In an Oval Office speech delivered to a prime-time broadcastaudience, he said his chief regret was the mammoth budget deficitthat accumulated after he pushed through the biggest tax cut inAmerican history.   Reagan addressed the nation from his Oval Office desk, his lefthand in a splint and swathed in bandages. The president had surgeryover the weekend to straighten a curvature of his left ring fingerthat had been caused by an ailment known as Dupuytren's Contracture.   Reagan said his chief triumphs were the nation's economicrecovery and ``the recovery of our morale'' and America's positionas a world leader. He said his tenure had stood for freedom andproved that ``democracy, the profoundly good, is also profoundlyproductive.''   He said ``nothing is less free than pure communism, and yet wehave, over the past few years, forged a satisfying new closenesswith the Soviet Union.'' His relationship with Mikhail Gorbachevblossomed in the course of over five meetings during Reagan's secondterm.   ``My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previousSoviet leaders,'' Reagan said. ``I think he knows some of the thingswrong with his society and is trying to fix them.''   His recommendation for the future was simple. ``What it all boilsdown to is this: I want the new closeness to continue.'' He followedup with his traditional warnings, ``Trust but verify ... Watchclosely _ and don't be afraid to see what you see.''   The national debt almost tripled in Reagan's term and he ran upthe biggest budget deficits in history. His final budget proposal,released earlier this week for the 1990 fiscal year starting Oct. 1,projects a deficit of $92.5 billion.   ``Action is still needed,'' he said. ``If we're to finish thejob, Reagan's Regiments will have to become Bush's Brigade.''   He called himself a ``citizen politician'' who sought office ``inpart to put up my hand an say, `Stop!' to big government, and added,``I think we have stopped alot of what needed stopping.''   He said he had changed American through the tax cuts, which, hesaid, gave people greater incentive to work.   He said his tenure had changed the world with a treaty to reducesuperpower nuclear stockpiles. Moreover, he said, his term had seen``the regional conficts that rock the globe'' begin to recede. Hecited Afghanistan, the Middle East and Angola.   He also said, ``Countries across the globe are turning to freemarkets and free speech.''   Of the disappointments during his tenure, Reagan said little.Nothing of the barracks bombing that took several hundred Marinelives in Beirut, nothing of the Americans taken hostage and stillheld captive, nothing of the trade deficits or the scandals thattarnished his administration.   Nothing of the decision to sell arms to Iran and use the proceedsto fund the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The Contras, subject of somany Reagan speeches, were not mentioned.   Citing ``a great tradition of warnings in presidentialfarewells,'' Reagan offered ``one that's been on my mind for sometime.''   He said an ``eradication of the American memory'' of the nation'shistory, ``could result, ultimately, in an erosion of the Americanspirit.''   ``We've got to do a better job of getting across that America isfreedom _ freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom ofenterprise _ and freedom is special and rare. It's fragile; it needsprotection.''   Reagan said even other countries had to acknowledge his successin bringing America out of an economic and morale slump.   ``Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and freespeech _ and turning away from the ideologies of the past. For them,the Great Rediscovery of the 1980s has been that, lo and behold, themoral way of government is the practical way of government.''   Reagan summarized what he said his presidency had proven: ``Onceyou begin a great movement, there's no telling where it will end. Wemeant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world.''   He said in the 1970s the United States entered into detente basedon Soviet promises, not actions. ``But this time, so far, it'sdifferent,'' he said, citing Gorbachev's push toward economic andpolitical reform within the Soviet Union and his promised withdrawalfrom Afghanistan.   The roughly 20-minute speech was Reagan's 34th from the OvalOffice.   In using television for the address, Reagan chose his favoritemedium, and also borrowed a page from the presidential books ofDemocrat Jimmy Carter in 1981 and Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in1961.   The speech was heavily studded with Reagan's reflections on hispresidency, on a fast-track existence that often had him ``going bytoo fast in a car someone else was driving, and seeing the peoplethrough tinted glass.''   ``And so many times I wanted to stop and reach out from behindthe glass, and connect,'' Reagan said.   Reagan said he likes to stand at a window looking toward Virginiaand providing a rich view of the Washington Monument and Mall, andsaid that ``I have been thinking a bit at that window.''   ``The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two thingsthat I'm proudest of. One is the economic recovery. ... The other isthe recovery of our morale; America is respected again in the world,and looked to for leadership.''   ``I've been asked if I have any regrets. I do. The deficit isone,'' he said. ``I've been talking a great deal about that lately,but tonight isn't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue.''   Reagan will continue being visible, with an appearance at amilitary ceremony in his honor at Andrews Air Force, Md. on Thursdayand his visit Friday night to a meeting of the Knights of Malta, aRoman Catholic civic organization, in New York.   The White House has not divulged Reagan's inauguration-weekschedule, although the president and his wife, Nancy, evidently willleave the capital immediately after President-elect Bush is sworn inon Jan. 20.   The speech came during a week in which the president was windingup his official business, including the submission of a proposedfiscal 1990 budget to Congress, and taking part in sentimentalgoing-away ceremonies.   After he posed with his Cabinet for the official class picture,Reagan was given the chair that he used for eight years in theCabinet Room. The presentation was made by Samuel Pierce, the onlyremaining member of the original Reagan Cabinet formed in 1981.   .</TEXT></DOC>
