(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two Harvard University computer expertsappeared Wednesday before a federal grand jury that is investigatingthe origin of a computer virus that jammed a nationwide network ofcomputers.   The investigation is focused on Cornell University graduatestudent Robert Morris Jr., 23, of Washington, D.C., who authoritiesbelieve created the virus.   The virus program transmitted copies of itself from computer tocomputer, cramming an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide. Itcaused at least $97 million in damage, because of interrupted workon computers that had to be shut down, and in the work needed toresuscitate the computers, according to the Computer Virus IndustryAssociation.   FBI agents in Massachusetts last week subpoenaed three people atHarvard, where Morris was a computer science undergraduate untilJune.   Two of them, graduate student Paul Graham and computer programmerAndrew H. Suddeth, appeared Wednesday afternoon before the grandjury.   Suddeth has said that Morris called him in a panic to get help ingetting out a message to other computer operators after he realizedwhat the virus was doing.   Suddeth on Tuesday said he wanted to stop commenting publiclyuntil he had appeared before the grand jury.   The third person subpoenaed, Mark Friedell, an associateprofessor of computer science at Harvard, was excused fromtestifying. He said he told prosecutors he knew nothing of Morris'alleged involvement with the virus.   Friedell was an adviser to Morris when Morris researched andwrote an undergraduate thesis about computers.   A week ago, federal agents seized computer tapes from filesMorris had at Harvard. The files, which are accessible to computerslocated off the Harvard campus, were created and edited a weekbefore the virus clogged the network.   On Nov. 10, FBI agents in Ithaca executed two other searchwarrants at Cornell, seizing computer tapes and notes that agentsbelieve are linked to the creation of the virus.   Morris' lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni of Washington, told thenewspaper that Morris has not been subpoenaed to appear before thegrand jury in Syracuse.   Guidoboni so far has advised Morris not to talk with anyone aboutthe virus, including FBI agents. However, the lawyer said anagreement may soon be reached in which an interview with agentswould be arranged.   Guidoboni said he was uncertain where Morris would be interviewed.   ``I think the FBI would like to talk with him,'' Guidoboni said.``But I'm not aware specifically what they'd like to talk to himabout.''</TEXT></DOC>
