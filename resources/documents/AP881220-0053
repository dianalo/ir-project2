They called Monday for suspension of aid shipments to Armeniauntil further notice. There have been about 140 foreign reliefflights.   Two-thirds of 27,000 rail cars that carried relief material tothe earthquake-stricken region have yet to be unloaded, said PerStenbaeck, secretary-general of the League of Red Cross and RedCrescent societies.   Another league official, Andrei Kisselev, said that due to a lackof international coordination the donor response has been ``far toogenerous.''   ``I think there are more kidney dialysis machines per capita inArmenia than anywhere in the world,'' Kisselev said, citing newsreports that said up to 75 machines were sent to the Soviet Unionwhile only 20 were requested.   They briefed reporters after returning from a two-day trip toYerevan to check on the relief operations for victims from the Dec.7 earthquake.   ``We shouldn't send more supplies,'' Stenbaeck said. ``And when Ihear that dog teams were sent on Saturday or Sunday, I mustprotest.'' He said the Soviets will have to return some of thedonations.   International donations should focus on money for rehabilitation,particularly workshops to manufacture artificial limbs, Stenbaecksaid. Orthopedic centers are needed for 4,000 people who lost limbs,according to Stenbaeck.   Officials in Armenia, however, are evaluating whether wintertents and additional transportation are still needed, he said. About53,000 tents are in the area, according to Soviet figures quoted bythe league.   Stenbaeck said he met with Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I.Ryzhkov, and they agreed that stronger coordination betweengovernments and private organizations is needed to ensure anefficient emergency program.   Ryzhkov also ``realized there is a need for rather thoroughchanges in the disaster response system in the Soviet Union,''Stenbaeck said.   ``Nobody has overall view of what has been sent off,'' Stenbaecksaid of the global effort. ``It took a week to find out what hasbeen stored in warehouses.''   The league, an arm of the International Red Cross, combines 147national societies and musters worldwide relief in case of disasters.   In Ankara, Turkey, the Soviet Embassy issued a list ofconstruction material needed for rebuilding. The list includedceramic tiles, washstands and tubs for kitchens and bathrooms.</TEXT></DOC>
