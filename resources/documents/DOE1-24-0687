<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-24-0687 </DOCNO><TEXT>Papers are presented on a failure analysis of a large centrifugal blower,field fractures in heavy equipment, a failure analysis of a liquid propanegas cylinder, an analysis of helicopter blade fatigue fracture by digitalfractographic imaging analysis, and the influence of failure analyseson materials technology and design. Also considered are an analysis ofaircraft component failures, the growth of short cracks in IN718, theimproper fabrication of rotating blades (resulting in premature failure),and low cycle thermal fatigue and fracture of reinforced piping. Othertopics include a nonlinear finite element analysis of stress concentrationat high temperature, the inelastic analysis of a hot spot on a heavyvessel wall, the accuracy and precision of mechanical test data generatedusing computerized testing systems, and maintenance related failures.</TEXT></DOC>
