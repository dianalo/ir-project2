Silverlake is the code name for International Business Machines' most important new product of the year, a long-awaited computer aimed at small businesses and corporate departments. IBM is widely expected to unveil the machine June 21 at a daylong extravaganza in New York.    The fanfare will be big because Silverlake's market is potentially huge. The machine will be a new model in IBM's unglamorous but sturdy 3X line, with 275,000 current customers making the line one of the best-selling computer families ever outside the PC world.    Beyond Big Blue, the debut will send ripples to hundreds of smaller software makers and distributors who feed on the 3X marketplace. Of these, Wall Street is already starting to finger two as Silverlake pure plays: XL/Datacomp, which distributes 3X computers, and System Software Associates, which sells 3X programs.    Both of these companies have seen their stock begin to climb in anticipation of the Silverlake announcement. And some analysts think the shares will climb more, once Silverlake starts shipping in late 1988.    It can be dangerous betting on the repercussions of an unknown new computer -- even one from IBM. For example, the noisy October 1986 announcement of IBM's 9370 midrange machine hoisted the stock of VM Software, a maker of programs for that class of computer. Over the next year, the 9370 started shaping up as a disappointment, and VM Software stock took a long tumble.    Silverlake fans insist things will be different this time around. They say IBM is avoiding a painful mistake that hobbled the 9370: bringing out the machine without assuring a good supply of software for it.    &quot;Silverlake customers will not only have a great new machine but have software to run on it day one,&quot; says Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette analyst Scott Smith.    Based in Hinsdale, Ill., XL/Datacomp has only one business: reselling 3X machines, along with software, accessories and service. That niche gave it net income of $4.7 million, or 67 cents a share, on revenue of $154.4 million in the fiscal year that ended last September.    Early rumblings about Silverlake have lifted XL/Datacomp's stock from the range of $13 to $15 at the start of the year. The shares closed Friday at 27. The few analysts who follow the company think the stock is worth more like $30, in large part because of the way Silverlake will energize the 3X market.    IBM won't say when Silverlake will emerge, beyond confirming that &quot;general availability will be in the second half.&quot; XL/Datacomp's president, Robert Passaneau, says the first machines will move in August, with big volumes shipping by the end of the year.    For XL/Datacomp, that will help per-share earnings more than double to about $1.50 in the fiscal year ending in September and hit $2 the year after that, says Stephen Cohen of Gartner Securities. Mr. Passaneau calls those numbers &quot;reasonable.&quot;    Timothy Summers, a Smith Barney, Harris Upham analyst, says the June 21 announcement also could boost XL/Datacomp by firing up the used-3X market, where uncertainty about Silverlake has deterred orders. Used computers account for about half of the company's revenue.    &quot;Silverlake will probably affect XL/ Datacomp as much as any company I'm aware of,&quot; Mr. Summers says.    System Software's stock has been creeping up for several weeks, closing Friday at 17 1/2. The six-year-old Chicago company has quietly built an impressive stronghold in the 3X software market, racking up net income of $3.3 million, or 68 cents a share, on sales of $30.9 million in the fiscal year ended last October.    Its vice president of sales, Richard Halperin, says that in this fiscal year, System Software expects to earn about $1.05 a share on sales of $55 million to $60 million. He also says the company will have Silverlake software ready the day of IBM's announcement.    The Silverlake outlook recently spurred Alex. Brown andamp; Sons analyst Chris Mortenson to raise his fiscal 1989 estimates for System Software to $1.50 a share from $1.37. But he also lowered his estimates for the quarter ending in July, when he expects to see business flatten before Silverlake shipments kick in.    Mr. Halperin acknowledges the company will probably see a sales lag of one or two months, while software customers make the transition to Silverlake.    Still, Donaldson Lufkin's Mr. Smith thinks System Software should eventually trade at a multiple of 20 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1989. That multiple would be more in line with the other software companies he describes as &quot;highgrowth, clear market leaders,&quot; such as Oracle Systems and Microsoft. &quot;Twenty times $1.50 is a big number,&quot; he says.    A few other companies could get a splash from Silverlake. LDI Corp., a small player in the computer leasing business, does a big chunk of business in the 3X market. Among software vendors, Pansophic Systems and Computer Associates both have major products that could get a lift when the curtain goes up on June 21. </TEXT></DOC>
