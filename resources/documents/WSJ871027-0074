GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration, angered by what it called Iran's &quot;increasingly bellicose behavior&quot; and prodded by Congress, imposed an embargo on trade between the U.S. and Iran.    The trade ban, which goes into effect almost immediately, covers all imports from Iran and nearly all exports to Tehran. A White House official said medical supplies to Iran aren't included on the list of barred shipments.    In the first seven months of 1987, Iranian exports to the U.S. climbed to about $937 million from $418 million for the same period in 1986, according to the Commerce Department. Oil made up about 86% of the total. During the same period, U.S. exports to Iran totaled $18 million, down from about $21 million, the Commerce Department said.    Congress overwhelmingly approved a trade embargo earlier this month after a U.S. government report showed a jump in Iranian imports. The report shows imports increasing at a time when Tehran is defying the U.S. and assaulting commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf.    The administration, which had been considering such a ban for several months, accelerated its deliberations after Congress acted. An administration official said the White House had consulted with congressional leaders about yesterday's action.    The White House said in a statement that it is taking these measures &quot;only after repeated but unsuccessful attempts to reduce tensions with Iran and in response to the continued and increasingly bellicose behavior of the Iranian government.&quot;    Tensions between Tehran and Washington heightened recently, as Iran stepped up its attacks. Last week, Iran fired a Silkworm missile, striking an oil tanker flying the U.S. flag for the first time. A day earlier, another Silkworm hit a U.S.-owned tanker in Kuwaiti waters.    The United Nations, with strong U.S. backing, has been attempting to persuade Iran and Iraq to end their seven-year war and agree to a cease-fire approved in July by the U.N. Security Council. Iraq has agreed to abide by the cease-fire if Iran does, but Tehran insists that the U.N. simultaneously appoint a commission to determine who started the war.    The State Department said yesterday that the U.N. Secretary General plans to complete his latest diplomatic round by the end of this month. The U.S. is pushing for a U.N. arms embargo on Iran if diplomatic efforts don't succeed.    The White House said that, in addition to oil, Iran currently exports to the U.S. caviar, pistachio nuts and some textile products.    The White House said it is banning 14 categories of U.S. exports to Iran. These include mobile communications equipment, boats, off-highway wheel tractors, large diesel engines, nonstrategic aircraft parts, portable electric generators and all marine engines.    Also included on the list: certain naval equipment, underwater photographic equipment, submersible systems, pressured aircraft breathing equipment, sonar navigation equipment, electronic test equipment and cryptographic equipment. The U.S. has already banned militarily sensitive exports such as aircraft.    The president acted under authority granted to him in the International Security and Cooperation Development Act.    The White House said the Treasury will publish rules implementing the trade ban. The ban on imports from Iran will take effect as soon as possible, the administration said. The controls on exports will go into effect within 10 days. </TEXT></DOC>
