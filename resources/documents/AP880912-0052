No pickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A letter attributed to a West Germanhostage by a Beirut newspaper says the man expects to be freedMonday by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors.   ``To the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, I shouldbe freed on Monday,'' said the nine-line letter attributed toRudolf Cordes and published Monday on the front page of theindependent newspaper An-Nahar.   There was no way to authenticate either that the handwriting wasthat of Cordes, who has been held for 20 months, or that thestatement was indeed from his captors.   The quote about his release was the only one that could be fullyunderstood from the handwritten letter. Other phrases, many wordsof which were illegible, said: ``Please inform my family'' andurged ``Please help the hostages.''   It was not clear if he was indicating he is being held withother hostages.   It also was unclear whether the letter was an attempt toinfluence the ongoing trial in West Germany of a Lebanese ShiiteMoslem, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who is charged with murder and airpiracy in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987 afterexplosives were found in his luggage. His older brother, Abbas, wasconvicted by a West German court in April of complicity in thekidnappings of Cordes and West German businessman Alfred Schmidt ina bid to free Mohammed.   Abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Schmidt, kidnappedseven days before Cordes' Jan. 17, 1987 abduction, was released inSeptember 1987.   Another Hamadi brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is believed to headthe Holy Warriors for Freedom, which claimed responsibility for thekidapping of Cordes, 55, Beirut manager for Hoechst AG, one of WestGermany's largest chemical companies.   Abdul-Hadi is also chief of the security apparatus of theIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.   Other pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist groups, all believedto be linked to one another, claim they are holding 17 otherforeigners, including nine Americans.   The hostage held the longest is American Terry Anderson, who wasabducted March 16, 1985.   An-Nahar said the letter was delivered to its West Beirutoffices at dawn Monday along with an Arabic statement, signed bythe Holy Warriors for Freedom.   The Arabic-language statement said the German-language letterwas written by Cordes.   The seven-line Arabic statement said:   ``We would like to inform those concerned that new developmentstoward the release of the West German Cordes will be announcedwithin the coming 48 hours. ``Therefore, a representative of(Syrian) President Hafez Assad and the West German ambassador arerequested to come to the Beaurivage Hotel within this period.''   The Beaurivage Hotel in the seaside Ramlet al-Baida district isclose to the command headquarters of Syrian troops in charge ofwest Beirut's security.   There was no explanation for the discrepancy for the Mondayrelease mentioned in the German letter and the 48-hour period inthe Arabic release.</TEXT></DOC>
