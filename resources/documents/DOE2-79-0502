According to theinvestigated sample are discussed spectra under continuous argon-ionlaser excitation together with (case of Eu-EDTA solutions) time-resolvedselectively-excited spectra recorded at 77 K. In this last case opticalmeasurements allowed the recognition of two species in the solution.</TEXT></DOC>
