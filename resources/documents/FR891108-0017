The rule addsa new section that provides for only one level of appeal with no discretionaryreview, and if a stay is granted, 45 days for the Regional Forester toissue a decision. Additionally, if a stay is granted, 15 days for interventionshall be allowed from the date a stay is granted. If a court challengeoccurs before an appeal decision is issued, the appeal record will be closedand the appeal dismissed without a decision on the merits. These specialprocedures will apply only to timber sale decisions made after October23, 1989 and prior to September 30, 1990, and awarded prior to September30, 1990, on 13 national forests in Oregon and Washington. The intendedeffect is to conform the present appeal procedures with the provisionsof section 318 of the 1990 Appropriations Act for the Department of theInterior and Related Agencies (Publ. L. 101-121).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective November 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Kathryn Hauser, Office of theDeputy Chief, National Forest System, Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090,Washington, DC 20090-6090, (202)382-9346.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On October 23, 1989, the Presidentsigned the Fiscal Year 1990 Appropriations Act for the Department of theInterior and Related Agencies (Pub. L. 101-121), which appropriates fundsfor most Forest Service programs. Section 318 of the Act establishes timbersale levels for national forests in Oregon and Washington and establishesspecial procedures applicable to the offering of timber for sale on 13national forests primarily on the westside of the Cascade Range betweenOctober 24, 1989 and September 30, 1990. Section 318 also establishes specialprocedures for administrative appeals of decisions to offer timber on theseforests. Specifically, only one level of appeal shall be available forany timber sales affected by the legislation; if a stay is granted, theappeal decision must be issued within 45 days by the Regional Forester;and administrative remedies need not be exhausted prior to challenginga decision in court.These special procedures conflict with the agency's rules governing appealand review of decisions of National Forest System plans and projects setforth at 36 CFR part 217. As a result, the agency must amend those rulesto account for the provisions of section 318 of the Act. Accordingly, theagency is establishing a new section at andSection; 217.20 to clarify whichdecisions are subject to the provisions of section 318 and how appealsof these decisions shall be handled.Paragraph (a) states that the procedures of andSection; 217.20 apply to decisionsto offer timber for sale made between October 24, 1989, and September 30,1990.Paragraph (b) lists the 13 national forests in Oregon and Washington thatare covered by the special appeal procedures.Paragraph (c) sets forth the special procedures that apply to appeals oftimber sale decisions under this section. As provided by the Act, onlyone level of administrative appeal is allowed, and if a stay is granted,the Regional Forester has 45 days to issue a decision. Consistent withthe Congress' aim of streamlining and expediting appeals of these decisions,paragraph (c)(2) provides that there shall be no discretionary review ofappeal decisions rendered. Because the law establishes a different timeframe for rendering an appeal decision when a stay is granted, it is necessaryto establish special procedures for intervention in such cases. This ruleallows 15 days for intervention from the date a stay is granted; otherwise,the normal time frames apply. Given that the Reviewing Officer has only45 days to review the record and render a decision, 15 days is the maximumtime that can be allowed for intervention without jeopardizing the 45-daydecision deadline and is a reasonable period for intervenors to prepareand present their comments on the issues raised in the notice of appeal.Finally, section 318 of the Act anticipates that lawsuits challenging thesedecisions may be filed in Federal court prior to rendering of an appealdecision by the Forest Service. The Act specifically provides that administrativeremedies need not be exhausted prior to challenging a sale decision incourt. Because andSection; 217.18 states that the Department of Agriculturewill normally argue that a legal challenge is premature prior to exhaustionof administrative remedies, it is necessary to make clear that, in casesinvolving decisions affected by section 318, the Department will not invokethis argument in any legal challenges of decisions covered by this rule.Paragraph (d) provides that all other procedures of part 217 apply to appealssubject to the special procedures of this section.Finally, the rule makes clear that the special procedures of the new sectionapply to decisions made after October 23, 1989, the date the act was signed,and September 30, 1990. Appeals of similar decisions filed between October1 and October 24, 1989, will continue under the normal procedures of part217.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for Final Rule</ITAG>Because the Appropriations Act is immediately effective upon signing andthe provisions of section 318 of the Act conflict with the agency's appealrules at 36 CFR part 217, it is imperative that the Department reconcileits rules to meet the requirements of the law immediately. Failure to doso would give rise to confusion among appellants and Forest Service employeesand lead to inconsistent processing of appeals. Notice and public commentprior to implementation would be impracticable and contrary to the intentof Public Law 101-121. Moreover, this rule is of limited duration and scopesince it applies to decisions on only 13 national forests. Therefore, thereis good cause to issue this rule as a final rule effective upon publication.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>This final rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order12291 on Federal Regulations. It has been determined that this is not amajor rule. The rule will not have an effect of $100 million or more onthe economy, substantially increase prices or costs for consumers, industry,or State or local governments, nor adversely affect competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete in foreign markets.Moreover, this final rule has been considered in light of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), and it has been determined that this action will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>Based on both experience and environmental analysis, this final rule willhave no significant effect on the human environment, individually or cumulatively.Therefore, it is categorically excluded from documentation in an environmentalassessment or an environmental impact statement (40 CFR 1508.4).<ITAG tagnum="84">Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public</ITAG>This rule does not contain any recordkeeping or reporting requirementsor other information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320and therefore imposes no paperwork burden on the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 217</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, National forests.Therefore, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, chapter II of title36 of the Code of Federal Regulations is hereby amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 217_REQUESTING REVIEW OF NATIONAL FOREST PLANS AND PROJECT DECISIONS</ITAG>1.
