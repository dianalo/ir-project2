The report painted a picture of a global civilization heatingits atmosphere in a myriad of ways, from burning fossil fuel todestroying tropical forests.   Those actions could force the average temperature up by 2degrees Fahrenheit in the next three decades, the report says. Thatmight not sound like much, but the scientists say it would beenough to wreak havoc.   Such a temperature increase, for example, would cause the sealevel to rise by 10 inches, bringing seawater an average of 83 feetinland, according to Oppenheimer.   ``The potential for economic, political and social destructionis extraordinary,'' said biologist George Woodwell.   To illustrate the warming trend, he noted that four of thehottest years in the last century have been recorded in the 1980s.   The organization held four news conferences around the world,including one in Washington, to talk about the report.   Oppenheimer said even if mankind abruptly stopped addingexcessive gases to the atmosphere, the delayed impact of alreadyreleased gases would eventually raise the average temperature 1 to2 degrees.   The scientists' estimates are tied to an assumption that theEarth's population, industrialization and emissions will continueto grow along the upward curve that has been followed for the last130 years.   The report also gives a scenario tied to an assumption thatworldwide growth and development could load the atmosphere withvastly increasing amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide,methane and chlorofluorocarbons.   In this case, the figures get two to three times worse: insteadof a 10-inch increase in the sea level, the report estimates a2-foot increase. Instead of a 2-degree increase in the averagetemperature, a 6-degree surge is called for. Oppenheimer says thattemperature level last occurred 2 million years ago.   Whatever the increases, the report paints a dismal picture forcoastal areas: erosion of beaches, loss of wetlands, more frequentand more severe flooding, damage to port facilities.   In its only cost estimate, the report said global expendituresof tens of billions of dollars will be needed over the next 50years for dikes, walls and drainage systems to counter rising seascaused by already released gases.   It forecasts destruction of forests and agricultural lands forthe mid-latitudes, the heavily populated band that encompasses theUnited States, China, Europe and the southern half of the SovietUnion.   Forest loss is a critical element, because this releases stillmore carbon into the atmosphere. The report says the mid-latitudenations probably will be able to maintain food production but indifferent growing areas.   Semi-arid tropical regions like northern Africa, Central Americaand India would lose already marginal agricultural areas and facescarcities of fresh water and wood for fuel. Humid tropics would bewetter and warmer.   In the high-latitudes like the northern Soviet Union,Scandinavia, Canada, the Arctic and the Antarctic, the scientistssee melting ice packs and glaciers, more clouds and precipitation,the slow disappearance of permafrost and the possibility of largecarbon releases from the soil.   The report says that limiting the amount of global warming``could be accomplished only with significant reductions'' in theuse of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum.   ``If reasonable economic growth rates are to be maintained,these reductions can be achieved only with two major changes: large(energy) efficiency increases of the order of one-half inindustrial nations and rapid deployment of alternative energysources,'' it said.   The report also calls for reduced deforestation and increasedforestation and implementation of last year's agreement amongindustrialized nations to decrease the production and use ofchlorofluorocarbons.   It cited the need for an international agreement ``on a law ofthe atmosphere'' to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, possiblysetting long-term environmental targets to control the rate oftemperature and sea level increases.   The report warned against world leaders attempting to dividecountries or regions into winners and losers in setting suchtargets.   ``This is not a `zero-sum' game,'' it said. ``Unless action istaken, it could be a negative-sum game of highly uncertainproportions.''</TEXT></DOC>
