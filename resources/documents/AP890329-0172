WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal authorities have smashed abillion-dollar international operation laundering drug money andforced Colombia's Medellin cartel to alter the way it handles drugprofits, the Justice Department said Wednesday.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, FBI Director William Sessionsand other top law enforcement officials said their ``OperationPolar Cap'' has ended with charges against 127 people and two LatinAmerican banks. Most of the charges related to cocaine possessionand distribution and money laund ering.   But Justice officials said one of the defendants, EduardoMartinez, eluded capture in Panama by the Panamanian Defense Forcesafter he holed up in a bank there Wednesday. U.S. authorities hadrelied on the defense forces for assistance, despite the fact it isheaded by Panamianian Gen. Manuel Noriega, who is himself under afederal indictment for drug trafficking.   Charles Saphos, chief of the Justice Department's narcotics anddangerous drug section, said the Panamanian Defense Forces haddetained Martinez's private plane that he had flown to Panama Cityas well as his pilots are are ``hoping he'll come back'' so theycan arrest him.   Thornburgh called the investigation ``the largestmoney-laundering crackdown ever carried out by the federalgovernment.''   Agents seized a half ton of cocaine and $45 million in cash,jewels and real estate, and filed civil actions in an effort toseize as much as $412 million more in assets of the banks, Banco deOccidente of Panama and Banco de Occidente of Colombia, that aredeposited in U.S. bank accounts.   The operation, reaching across the United States into SouthAmerica and to England, had direct ties to the Medellin drug cartelof Colombia and laundered $1.2 billion over two years, JusticeDepartment officials said.   The cartel is responsible for as much as 80 percent of thecocaine flowing into the United States, according to federal drugofficials.   ``There is no more effective way to deal with the business ofdrug traffickig than to take the profit out of it. That's what hashappened with Operation Polar Cap,'' Thornburgh said at a newsconference.   ``I think it's fair to describe this operation as a very hostiletakeover of a major money laundering operation,'' he said.   U.S. officials said the laundering operation played asignificant role in the handling of the cartel's illegal drugproceeds and was known within the drug world as ``La Mina,'' or``The Mine.''   Agents learned of the ring while operating an undercovermoney-laundering operation of their own in Atlanta as part of ajoint investigation by federal agencies, including the InternalRevenue Service and Drug Enforcement Agency.   Authorities said that undercover agents received complaints fromalleged drug-world figures that they were moving too slowly intheir laundering, or processing the money into seemingly legitimateaccounts.   The agents were told La Mina could get the money by wire fromLos Angeles to Panama within 48 hours, according to court documentsreleased with the indictments.   Federal agents then expanded their investigation into thatoperation, using electronic intercepts, surveillance and pursuit offinancial paper trails.   Thornburgh said that while it is difficult to determine how muchimpact the federal action will have on the Medellin cartel,``common sense tells me when you disrupt an operation that haslaundered over a billion dollars in two years, you're going toforce some adjustment in their operation.''   DEA administrator John Lawn said that one indication of theeffect was seen immediately by drug agents. When La Mina was forcedout of business, he said, ``the phone was ringing off the hook'' atthe undercover money-laundering operation that was continuing inAtlanta, with requests for use of their services.   The Atlanta agents were so busy they laundered $4 million inthree days, he said.   ``If there were other facilities within the United States forthe laundering of money, they would not have come back to a minormoney-laundering operation that was causing them trouble withgetting their money moved quickly,'' Lawn said.   Arrests began in Los Angeles in February, where federal agentscharged that large amounts of money was being laundered throughjewelry dealers who allegedly used phony gold shipments to coverthe transactions.   Thornburgh told reporters during a luncheon meeting in hisprivate dining room that Martinez, of Medellin, Colombia, was holedup in a bank in Panama that was surrounded by Panamanian DefenseForces. He had been scheduled to meet with undercover agents inPanama on Wednesday.   However, later in the afternoon Martinez somehow managed toescape from the bank, said Bruce Pagel, a trial attorney with theJustice Department's narcotics section.   ``I don't know what the logistics were,'' Pagel said. ``The lastinformation I had was he was not in custody and ... they are notexpecting to take him into custody at the moment.''   Lawn said the Panamanian forces had continued to cooperate withDEA despite Noriega's indictment.   ``Obviously, they are circumspect in dealing with them,''Thornburgh said of DEA. ``These are not naive individuals. On theother hand, they're faced with the necessity of having to deal withlaw enforcement in Central and South America, and I assume they'redoing the best they can.''   Martinez is described in the indictment as an associate andagent of Geraldo Moncada, whom the government accused oforganizing, supervising and managing for the Medellin cartel theimportation, sale and distribution of cocaine in the United States,and in particular, in New York.   The Justice Department said that among the indictments resultingfrom the investigation were charges against 29 people unsealed inAtlanta and eight people arrested Tuesday evening in New York.   Federal agents were seizing accounts at banks in Atlanta, Miami,New York and the San Francisco-San Jose area, the department said.   An indictment charges that the general manager of Banco deOccidente of Panama, William Guarin, and other bank officersauthorized the use of the bank to accept wire transfers on behalfof the cartel. Thornburgh said there was no evidence of illegalactivity by U.S. banks, and that the banks cooperated in theinvestigation.</TEXT></DOC>
