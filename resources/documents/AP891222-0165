Brennan Jr. cleared the wayFriday for a Jewish group to erect a menorah on the steps of theCity-County Building in Pittsburgh for the start of Hanukkah.   Brennan vacated a ruling made just hours before by a panel ofthe 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that would have prevented thedisplay, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said.   The eight-day Jewish festival of lights began at sundown Friday.   Brennan's action reinstated a preliminary injunction issuedWednesday against the city by a U.S. district court judge, Arbergsaid.   City officials had refused to allow the Jewish group Chabad toset up an 18-foot menorah next to a Christman tree. City officialssaid they had not authorized the area outside the building to beused as a public forum.   A federal judge Thursday denied a request from the city to delaythe lower court's decision. The city immediately appealed, andJudge Joseph Weis of the 3rd Circuit Court temporarily stopped thefederal judge's order until three members of his court could reviewit.   Chabad and three Jewish residents sued the city a week ago,alleging their civil rights were violated by the exclusion of themenorah from the holiday display. The menorah was part of thedisplay for most of the 1980s.   In a hearing before Senior U.S. District Judge Barron McCune,Chabad lawyer Nathan Lewin argued that the area in front of thebuilding is a public forum where free speech, including display ofreligious symbols, cannot be denied.   McCune agreed, ordering the city to allow Chabad to erect themenorah in the same place it had been in 1986. That was the yearthe city was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union over themenorah and a Nativity scene at the City-County Building.   The Supreme Court ruled in July that the menorah, placed next tothe Christmas tree, was constitutional, but that the Nativity scenewas unconstitutional because it was not part of a general holidaydisplay.   Pittsburgh Deputy Solicitor George Specter told Weis the area infront of the building was not a public forum simply because cityofficials did not stop demonstrations from taking place.   ``There is no evidence in this area at all that the city ofPittsburgh even openly and intentionally authorized the use of thebuilding as a public forum,'' Specter said.   Another Chabad lawyer, Elliot Katz, argued the city created thepublic forum by allowing the menorah to be displayed in past years.</TEXT></DOC>
