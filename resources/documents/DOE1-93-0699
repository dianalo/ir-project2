Many imaging modalities have been appliedto breast cancer, including mammography, ultrasonography, computerizedtomography, and thermography. More recently interest has turned to NMRor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (as it is termed in more current usage)for the detection of breast disease and particularly carcinoma of thebreast. This review discusses the present role of MR imaging in the diagnosisof breast lesions based on work from several institutions. Possible areasfor future development to increase the usefulness of MR as a diagnosticmodality are discussed. For those not familiar with terminology usedin the field of MR, a short glossary of terms is supplied at the endof the chapter. Some general references on MR imaging are give at theend of the references for those wishing to review the subject in general.</TEXT></DOC>
