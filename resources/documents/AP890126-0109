(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Navy successfully launched theTrident 2 submarine missile on its 19th and final test flight from aland-based pad Thursday and said it is now ready to begin criticalunderwater firings.   The three-stage, 44-foot missile thundered away from its seasidelaunch pad at 4:07 a.m. EST and left a fiery wake as it propelled adummy warhead to an undisclosed Atlantic Ocean target.   A Navy statement said the test was successful, ending a series ofTrident 2 land-launch tests that began Jan. 15, 1987. Officials hadplanned 20 such tests, but decided to stop at 19 because of recentsuccesses.   Of the 19 tests, the Navy rated 15 successful and one a ``notest,'' which occurred when an Air Force safety officer destroyedthe missile by triggering on-board explosives after radar indicatedit was off course.   The missile was deliberately sent off course to test the guidancesystem's ability to correct its path, but the safety officer was notnotified.   The USS Tennessee, the first of nine nuclear submarines beingbuilt to carry Trident 2 missiles, is scheduled to conduct the firstunderwater firing of the weapon in the next several weeks inAtlantic waters off Cape Canaveral.   Several undersea tests are planned and the missile is to becomeoperational later this year.   The Tennessee, commissioned Dec. 17 in New London, Conn., isscheduled to be fitted with 24 of the missiles, each capable ofpropelling 10 nuclear warheads to different targets more than 5,000miles away.</TEXT></DOC>
