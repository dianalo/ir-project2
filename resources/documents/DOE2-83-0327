Themost-generaltheoretical explanation contrasts recent realist theories, like thoseof Waltz and Gilpin, with Keohane's functional theory of regimes. Secondly,the study looks at theories of information flow and processing (an elementof consultation) within the alliance, like those of Deutsch and Steinbruner.Such theories explain governmental behavior using concepts like equilibriumof systems and feedback loop. Third, the study considers hypotheses thatdeal specifically with NATO and military alliances. The hypotheses relatealliance consultation processes to the cooperativeness of the cases'outcomes. Evidence is drawn from case studies of NATO decision-making.The cases include politically sensitive deployment issues, like the enhancedradiation warhead controversy in 1977-78 and the intermediate-range nuclearforce deployment decision in 1979, and important, but less politicallyvolatile arms-control decisions, including the 1975 option three proposal,the French plan for a conference on disarmament in Europe, approved in1980, and the 1987 American zero-zero proposal on short- and intermediate-rangenuclear forces in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
