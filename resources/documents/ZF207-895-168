 But it will be a while yet before anyone besidestelephone operators sees benefits.andM;&quot;The network as a whole is becoming very heavily fibred these days,&quot; reportsDavid Kahn, a Bell-Northern Research specialist in cost-effective systemsdesign.andP;  &quot;We have large capacities around central offices but lack affordablesolutions for transmitting those capacities to the ordinary resident.andM;&quot;I'm fed up with the thought that after 100 years of telecommunicationsservice we're still restricted to a monophonic channel with a three kilohertzbandwidth,&quot; he told participants at a recent Ottawa seminar on photoniccommunications and networking.andP;  Co-hosting the event were theTelecommunications Research Institute of Ontario (TRIO) and the OttawaCarleton Research Institute (OCRI).andM;Kahn partly blamed the absence of residential fibers on traditional networkdistribution architectures favouring copper transmission.andP;  Residentscurrently receive telephone service over dedicated physical channels -- acostly proposition if fibre is the means of transmission.andM;Individual fibers offer so much bandwidth it makes more sense to share them,he argued.andP;  &quot;Why not bring fibre to the kerb rather than the residence?&quot;andM;Another problem, until recently, was subscriber rate structures whichsubsidized basic telephone services at the expense of long distance use.andP;  Nowthat every one pays a fair share and the price of optical components isdropping, said Kahn, the economics justify laying down more fibre.andM;If telephone companies don't act soon, he said, others will.andP;  &quot;A lot ofpeople, including cable companies and electric utilities, are anxious toenter the game.&quot;andM;&quot;Suppliers and users are tired of waiting for new services to pay for fibreinstallation,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;The consensus today is that interesting broadbandapplications won't appear until the fibre infrastructure is in place.andM;&quot;Once it's in the ground you can always upgrade the ends with fancyelectronics and offer more services.&quot;andM;Kahn cited studio-quality audio, viewphones and dial-up video as a fewexamples of what the future holds in store.andM;&quot;We'll see on-demand TV bringing local feeds from council meetings, schoolplays and sports events.andP;  And the frustrations of working at home willcertainly disappear,&quot; he predicted.andP;  &quot;Home computer users will be able tocommunicate cheaply with computer networks -- sending and receiving datafiles, high quality graphics, drawings and transparencies.andM;However, another speaker warned seminar participants not to hold their breathin anticipation.andP;  Dr. Martin Pollack, head of photonic devices research atATandamp;T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, said progress is slower thanexpected in developing optoelectronic and photonic integrated circuits thatwill ultimately connect fibers to home terminals, as well as interconnectboards, chips and computers.andP;  Theoretically, they will increase systemsreliability, decrease circuit sizes and reduce packaging costs.andM;Scientists have so far learned how to put waveguides and tunable lasers on achip, he noted.andP;  And they can couple waveguides to photodetectors andphotodetectors to electronics.andP;  But questions like what is the best materialto use -- gallium arsenide or gallium indium arsenide phosphide -- remainunresolved.andM;&quot;And we haven't yet been able to optimize individual circuits,&quot; said Pollack.andO;&quot;The challenge involves combining devices, such as photodiodes andtransistors, which have incompatible requirements.&quot;andM;&quot;The bottom line is that only a few simple optoelectronic and photonicintegrated circuits have been demonstrated.andP;  But none with any cost orperformance advantage.andM;&quot;Research institutes could be kept busy for years to come solving theproblems of both OEICs and PICs, he speculated.andM;Peter Leach, president of TRIO, said the academic world isn't doing enough todrive photonics research forward.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
