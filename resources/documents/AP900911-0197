Bush, in comments prompted by the Persian Gulf crisis, called onCongress to enact his proposals by the end of the month.   In his televised address to a joint session of Congress, thepresident noted that the country's foreign oil imports haveincreased since the oil embargo of 1973.   Imports were 6 million barrels a day before that, and, he said,``This year, before the Iraqi invasion (of Kuwait), U.S. importshad risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day. We had moved in thewrong direction. Nowe we must act to correct that trend.''   Bush put Congress on notice that he will be reviving the Alaskadrilling proposal, a proposal that has been dormant since lastyear's Alaska tanker spill off Valdez.   The issue is sensitive for environmentalists, who say the oilcompanies should be forced to keep their hands off the pristinerefuge on the north coast of Alaska.   Bush said Congress should enact his proposals for: increasingincentives for domestic oil and gas exploration; encouragingconversion from oil to natural gas and accelerating the developmentof Alaskan energy resources, ``without damage to wildlife.''   Bush has long supported oil exploration in the wildlife reserve,but Congress must approve.   His proposals on so-called fuel switching are embodied in CleanAir Act revisions, currently being worked over in a conference ofthe House and Senate.   On incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration, Bush's 1991budget contains several proposals, including temporary tax creditsfor exploratory drilling expenditures and for new oil recoveryprojects; and more favorable deductions for drilling costs ofindependent producers.   Bush did not mention that he has blocked new exploration inpromising areas off the California coast, and administrationofficials have said he has no intention of changing his mind onthat issue.</TEXT></DOC>
