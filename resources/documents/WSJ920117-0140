The newspaper quoted the report as saying that recordedattacks on foreigners rose from an annual average of 200-250to 2,368 in 1991, the first full year of German unification.   The report said federal criminal investigation authoritiesrecorded hundreds of fire bombings of hostels housingasylum-seekers as well as physical assaults on individuals.The problem has prompted a police crackdown on neo-Nazi gangsand a greater effort to protect foreigners in the country.   Most of the culprits were neo-Nazi skinheads andright-wing high school students, vocational apprentices orunemployed young people, the report said.                                                                                                          INDIA DECONTROLS STEEL PRICES                                                                                                          India deregulated steel prices, opening a vital sector tofree-market forces and moving boldly despite mountingpolitical opposition to radical economic reform. Steelprices, which the government has controlled sinceindependence in 1947, were to be deregulated as of midnightThursday. The government will retain partial control of steeldistribution for &quot;sensitive sectors,&quot; and help major steelconsumers such as defense, railways and other key governmententerprises get priority in procuring the metal. A 20% cut inimport tariffs on steel products was also announced.                                                                                                          FRANCE TARGETS PORNO SERVICES                                                                                                          The French government has imposed a 50% income tax on the&quot;message services&quot; that enable users to talk dirty oncomputer screens. The 28 services subject to the decree,bearing such names as &quot;Confess&quot; and &quot;Envy,&quot; are availablethrough Minitel, the state home computer network that ishooked into about one-fifth of France's phone lines. The tax,a substantial increase over the usual 34% commercial incometax, represents a rare assault on pornography, which iswidespread in France. In a separate move, Paris policeannounced the nightly closure beginning Monday of four mainroads crossing the Bois de Boulogne, a suburban park that hasbecome synonymous with prostitution in the French capital.Roads leading to popular sports grounds and restaurants willremain open.                                                                                                          IRAQI AIRLINE RESUMES SERVICE                                                                                                          Iraq's national carrier resumed domestic services after ayear-long suspension caused by the Gulf War. Iraqi Airwaysflew 33 passengers from Baghdad to Basra to mark theresumption of commercial flights, the official Iraqi NewsAgency said. No flight schedule was given, nor did the agencysay if service would be resumed to other cities in Iraq.World airports remain closed to the Iraqi flag carrier undertight United Nations trade sanctions imposed after SaddamHussein's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.   KUWAIT ASKS JAPAN FOR HELP                                                                                                          Kuwait asked Japan for more cooperation from its privatesector in its post-war reconstruction efforts. Kuwait's oilminister, Hamoud al-Rquba, told visiting Japanese Minister ofInternational Trade and Industry Kozo Watanabe that Kuwaitwould welcome Japanese participation in various fields, suchas construction of power plants and desalinizationfacilities.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIA TO ACCEPT GATT CODE                                                                                                          Australia said it will accept the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade product testing standards code as soon asis practical. Trade Minister John Kerin said acceptance ofthe Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, known as thestandards code, would improve Australia's access to worldmarkets. Australia's acceptance of the code will go intoeffect 30 days after it notifies GATT.                                                                                                          EC DELAYS VOTE ON TOBACCO ADS                                                                                                          The European Parliament delayed its vote on controversialproposals to ban almost all tobacco advertising throughoutthe European Community, a move that marked a minor victoryfor the tobacco industry lobby.   Opponents of the proposed measure succeeded in getting itreferred to the legal affairs committee, which will be askedto rule on whether the EC Commission has chosen the correctlegal basis for the legislation. The ban was proposed assinglemarket legislation, which is subject to weightedmajority voting by EC ministers. But some members of theParliament argued that it is health legislation, which needsunanimous approval.   The decision, which is likely to postpone the Parliament'sfirst reading by one month, was attacked by supporters of theban as a delaying tactic.   During ministerial talks, Britain, Germany and theNetherlands staunchly opposed the ban, and the threecountries have enough votes to block the move. Denmark thisweek dropped its opposition to the measure.

Contracts won by British firms in the reconstruction ofKuwait covered the net cost of Britain's militarycontribution to the Gulf War. British companies won a totalof more than 100 contracts, valued at nearly #500 million($876 million), to help rebuild Kuwait. The campaign costBritain #2.5 billion, but some #2 billion of this wasrecouped from foreign governments, leaving a net cost roughlyequivalent to the contracts. . . . Taiwan's total trade withEastern Europe jumped 56.1% in 1991 to $707.6 million.</TEXT></DOC>
