The court said it will review a ruling that police violated theman's rights when they arrested him without a warrant at the housea where he was staying.   Robert Olson was convicted of murder, armed robbery and assaultin the July 18, 1987, holdup of a Minneapolis gas station. Thestation's manager was shot to death. Olson was sentenced to life inprison plus six years.   The Minnesota Supreme Court overturned Olson's conviction lastFebruary and granted him a new trial, ruling that he had been thevictim of an unlawful arrest.   Police, acting on an informant's tip, did not obtain a courtwarrant or permission to enter the house where Olson was stayingbefore they went in and arrested him.   The fact that Olson was a guest at the home did not deprive himof privacy rights, the state court said.   Noting that police said they failed to get a warrant because itwas a Sunday, the state court said that is ``surely a curiousreason for not observing the constitutional safeguards ofcitizens.'' The state court also rejected arguments that policewere faced with an emergency.   Ordering a retrial, the state Supreme Court said prosecutors maynot use a statement Olson made shortly after the arrest in which headmitted driving the getaway car. Prosecutors said discrepancies inthe statement undermine Olson's claim that he was an innocent dupeof the man who held up the gas station and shot the manager.   Minnesota's appeal to the nation's highest court was supportedby the National District Attorneys Association and officials from10 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan,Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, South Carolina and Vermont.   The justices were urged to clarify whether house guests have thesame right against unreasonable police searches and seizures aspeople in their own homes.   The case is Minnesota vs. Olson, 88-1916.</TEXT></DOC>
