Hesaid colleges wrongly had put ``intellectual education'' beforeideological and moral teaching.   Since crushing student-led protests for a freer society six weeksago, Chinese leaders have expressed determination not only to roundup those involved in the protests but to root out what they see asthe causes _ especially Western ideas.   They have jammed radio signals from the U.S. government-run Voiceof America, turned off local hotels' reception of foreign televisionbroadcasts, and banned sales of foreign newspapers and magazines inBeijing.   But their greatest efforts have been directed at reeducating thetens of thousands of students who marched nationwide under bannersdemanding freedom and democracy, and who the leaders say were misledby professors with anti-socialist ideas.   ``We must be full of warmth toward the broad masses of studentsbut also make strict demands,'' Communist Party General SecretaryJiang Zemin told party Youth League officials from around thecountry.   ``We must strengthen patriotic and socialist ideologicaleducation and strengthen education in national pride, nationalmorality and (the correct) world view,'' television quoted Jiang assaying at the meeting Sunday.   In a separate forum, party secretaries from major universitiesmet with the editorial board of the Guangming Daily, a newspaper forintellectuals, and puzzled over why so many products of a socialisteducation system were dissatisfied with socialism.   Several blamed Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted as party chief June 24for allegedly supporting the protests.   ``We must save those students who suffered spiritual damage dueto the ... 50 days of counterrevolutionary propaganda, rumors andincitement,'' the paper quoted the deputy party secretary of QinghuaUniversity, He Meiying, as saying. Graduating seniors in Beijingalready have undergone several weeks of special political classes,and underclassmen face a month of concentrated political educationin August and September.   The impact of the classes remains to be seen. Even after thegovernment condemned the student protests as counterrevolutionaryand sent the army to crush them June 3-4, many students saidprivately they had not dropped their goal of reforming China'sclosed, one-party system.   In other developments, a Shanghai worker was sentenced to 12years in prison for attacking two drivers of a train that plowedinto a crowd of protesters June 6, killing six people.   An angry crowd set the train on fire, and three men later wereconvicted of arson and executed.   The Shanghai-based Liberation Daily said Jiang Xidi, a factoryworker, was sentenced Friday by a city district court. The samecourt sentenced a private tradesman to 3{ years in prison and apeasant to four years for shouting reactionary slogans and lettingthe air out of bus tires to barricade city roads.   An unemployed man was sentenced to 11 years for shoutingreactionary slogans, incitement and spreading rumors.</TEXT></DOC>
