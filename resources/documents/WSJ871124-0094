But it is hard to find a Pole who is about to be taken.    &quot;Where's the justice?&quot; demands a leathery farmer encountered on this mill town's main street. He ignores a stranger's request for directions to the nearest registration office for Sunday's referendum on economic reform. Instead, he volunteers a tirade.    &quot;What the hell do we need this reform for?&quot; he asks. &quot;Nothing will change. They should all be put up against a wall and shot. Goodbye.&quot;    And with a disgusted wave of the hand, he storms off.    On Zyrardow's sooty red-brick walls, the state has pasted up the propositions of Poland's first referendum in 41 years. The Polish people are being asked to determine the &quot;degree and rate&quot; of a program of market-oriented economic reforms that the government unveiled last month. The overhaul would include an average 40% increase in prices. Solidarity, the banned independent trade union movement, has urged a boycott of the vote. And yesterday, government-authorized unions took an unprecedented tough stand by demanding 100% pay raises to help workers deal with the impending cost-of-living surge.    In the most-recent referendum, in 1946, the people were asked to show their support of communism. This time, the communists have asked them to vote for a &quot;radical cure&quot; of the economy and for a &quot;Polish model&quot; of democracy. Last time, as usual, communism won. This time, the communists might not get the approval they are seeking.    In its early soundings, the state has found that only half of those eligible intend to vote; another 30% aren't sure. And of those sure to vote, only about half say they favor a cure that will begin with a doubling of food prices and a tripling of rents and energy costs.    If it loses, the state says it will pursue reform anyway, only more slowly. Yet many a Pole seems to think the &quot;second stage&quot; of reform, like the one that preceded it, will begin with price increases and go little further. If a stay in this town of 36,000 is any indication, the doubters have turned Poland's latest referendum into a horse race.    &quot;We are waiting for some delivery, nobody knows what,&quot; says a woman jammed with a dozen others into the foyer of the town's small department store, which is stocked mainly with baby carriages.    &quot;Whatever it is, it will cost more in January,&quot; says another. &quot;Washing machines, we hope.&quot;    Does anyone here plan to vote on Sunday?    &quot;No!&quot; several shout, venting their opinions as few people in other Soviet bloc countries would dare.    &quot;Whether I vote or not, it will be the same devil,&quot; says a woman with a silver front tooth. A man pushes through to add his two zlotys: &quot;In the '50s they told me I'd be really well off when I got old. Well, look at me!&quot;    &quot;They lie to us on television!&quot; someone yells, and someone else: &quot;Work, work until you're hunchbacked!&quot;    Then a young man appears in the doorway. &quot;No delivery today,&quot; he says. &quot;I talked to the manager.&quot; The women shrug and go home.    At one end of Zyrardow's central square, opposite the red-brick Roman Catholic church, stands the linen mill that a Frenchman founded 150 years ago. The town, 40 miles from Warsaw, was part of Russia then. The Germans came next, and built more mills. In 1883, their workers rose in a communist-led strike; a rusty monument to it stands in the square. Nearly a century later, the mill workers rose again, this time goaded by price increases and led by Solidarity.    Since then, the only new presence in Zyrardow's square has been the PRON office. The Patriotic Movement for National Renewal, as the acronym translates, appeared after martial law and the banning of Solidarity to try putting Poland together again. On the state's behalf, it is running the campaign to win the referendum.    &quot;We are putting up small notices,&quot; says PRON's local chairman, Marian Glowacki, who sits behind a table in a houndstooth jacket. He also runs a clothing factory in town. &quot;We don't say, 'vote yes.' We want people to feel right inside. So we present objective reality: There is only one way out.&quot;    Mr. Glowacki seems unaware that some citizens of Zyrardow don't feel at all right inside. &quot;Yes, there is confusion,&quot; he admits. &quot;But enlightened people know economic laws must be applied. I'm sure they don't believe their standard of living will go down.&quot;    In a food shop around the corner, two of the enlightened ones are furiously stocking shelves with four-pound bags of sugar, which a mob of the less-enlightened instantly snaps up. Even if wages go up along with prices, some customers here behave as if they do expect to get a lot poorer.    &quot;Everything sold,&quot; says Wanda Szlaga, a clerk in a polka-dot smock with a big name tag. &quot;Salt. Flour. Everything.&quot;    &quot;Panic,&quot; says her colleague, Hanna Sawicka, &quot;always makes things seem worse.&quot;    Neither likes the idea of price leaps; both agree Poland needs them. &quot;We will vote 'yes,'&quot; says Mrs. Sawicka. Mrs. Szlaga stops stacking and looks serious. &quot;We understand the need,&quot; she says. &quot;You must believe in something. If you don't, how can you live?&quot;    Around Zyrardow, though, many more non-believers are wondering how you can live with radical reform if you don't eat.    A farmer at the bus station: &quot;The shops will be full and nobody will be able to buy anything.&quot; A drinker in a bar: &quot;There will never be any money here. Never.&quot; A man in church, waiting to see the priest: &quot;How can I vote for something that will make me worse off? I won't be taken in.&quot; And the priest himself: &quot;This referendum is like asking a carp, 'Would you rather be fried or poached?'&quot;    To clear up such confusion, PRON convenes public meetings, the focus of Campaign Poland '87. In the teachers' club on a dark afternoon, Mr. Glowacki is on hand with Zyrardow's party boss to boost reform. The audience includes housing-project residents and a class of teen-agers dragooned from the technical college.    First an economist reads out the reform's 129 points. Teen-agers fidget. Then a woman explains the vote. &quot;It is an opportunity for civic-minded reflection,&quot; she says. When she sits, Mr. Glowacki calls for questions, which come thick and fast.    A man in a blue sweater: &quot;Who will get goods in short supply? Those who are powerful?&quot; A man in a brown suit: &quot;Why do the same people who failed before think they can create paradise?&quot; A white-haired man: &quot;What guarantee is there that we will reach the aim of this reform -- in two or three words?&quot;    The party boss gets up. &quot;Ministers don't guarantee anything,&quot; he says. &quot;We should just give them a chance.&quot;    Older people begin a debate about rennovation of their apartment houses. And they demand to know why a shop in their area has been closed. An hour goes by before a bored teen-ager raises his hand.    &quot;How come,&quot; he says, &quot;we want a second stage of reform if we haven't carried out the first?&quot; Snickering, another asks, &quot;Will there be a third stage of reform?&quot;    Mr. Glowacki checks his watch. People begin to leave. &quot;I encourage you to change your attitude,&quot; he tells the teen-agers as they file out, &quot;beginning on Nov. 29.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
