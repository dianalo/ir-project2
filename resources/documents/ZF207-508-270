Petrillo.andM;The OAO motion accuses a former company senior vice president of workingillegally for Vanguard either as an employee or a consultant and giving thecompany proprietary pricing information.andP;  The former OAO employee, RustinBehl, signed a two-year non-compete agreement before leaving the company, OAOsaid.andM;&quot;We certainly vehemently deny the allegations,&quot; said Vanguard's presidentDean Crawford.andP;  Because the protest is in litigation, Crawford said he couldmake no further comment and would neither confirm nor deny Behl's associationwith the company.andM;This is a corporate dispute between competing companies and has nothing to dowith the settlement, Petrillo said.andP;  &quot;It clearly doesn't belong in theprotest,&quot; he said.andM;OAO also questioned whether Vanguard should be allowed to submit a BAFObecause the company has had access to OAO's price proposals through theprotest process.andP;  &quot;In preparing its best-and-final offer, Vanguard will notonly have OAO's total price, but also a source of detailed informationconcerning the components of that price,&quot; the motion said.andM;In its protest, Vanguard claimed the IRS unfairly dropped the company fromthe competition before the best-and-final offer round.andM;Vanguard also alleged the IRS evaluated its pricing incorrectly and ignoredthe evaluation criteria.andM;Only OAO, Vanguard and EDS vied for the six-year contract to providetechnical support for IRS mainframe, minicomputer and microcomputeroperations and to develop application and systems software.andP;  Vanguard is thefour-year incumbent.andM;The IRS dropped Vanguard and EDS from the procurement in April, saying theirproposals were not in the competitive range.andM;In almost identical letters to the two companies, the IRS said the proposed&quot;price for the entire contract life cycle is significantly high&quot; and theproposals received a &quot;low aggregate technical score.&quot;andM;The RFP defined technical aspects as more crucial than price.andP;  Yet, Vanguardsaid in its protest, the IRS listed the proposal's price as the main reasonfor the company's elimination from the procurement.andM;Vanguard supplied hourly wage cost figures and, by using these as flat fees,the IRS did not consider &quot;the relative efficiency of offerers,&quot; the protestsaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
