Dressed in black, stocky with dark,glowering eyebrows, he rumbles into the microphone as 300rapt students hang on his words. &quot;No, Luke. I am your . . .{wheeze} . . . father.&quot;   It's the climax of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back,&quot; and asscript-writing guru Mr. McKee enacts it, Luke Skywalker hasjust learned the true identity of the dread enemy he has beenstalking through two feature-length movies.</LP><TEXT>   Socko endings like this -- where the hero comes face toface with the powerful antagonistic forces arrayed againsthim and the plot twists still another time -- well, suchmoments are the apex of the screenwriter's art, according toMr. McKee.   &quot;If you can create this most sublime ending of all,&quot; hesays, &quot;you too can have a Mercedes and a home in BeverlyHills.&quot;   It hooks them every time -- in Los Angeles, New York,Toronto, London and the more than two dozen other cities hereand abroad where Mr. McKee has taken his script-writingroadshow. For $350 a head, studio executives, performers andwriters (as well as hopefuls) give up a weekend to learn thelost art of storytelling -- and, by tantalizing implication,the mysteries of box-office success.   In his seamless, 30-hour near-monologue, Mr. McKee heapsdisdain upon film-school &quot;auteurs&quot; with their dazzling butempty camera work. Audiences, he says, hunger for well-told,classically structured tales, and Hollywood isn't delivering.As he sniffs the scene: &quot;That's not smog in LA. It's thestench of all the rotten scripts.&quot;   Movies, he says, are propelled by an &quot;inciting incident&quot;that pitches the hero's life out of balance and sends him ona quest to restore that balance. In &quot;Jaws,&quot; it was when theshark ate the swimmer. In &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer,&quot; it was Mrs.Kramer's decision to leave her child with her husband. Theeffect on the audience, he suggests, is to provoke thequestion &quot;how will this turn out?&quot; and to foreshadow in theirminds the final crisis: when, for example, the sheriff fightsthe shark. &quot;Nothing moves forward except through conflict,&quot;Mr. McKee says. &quot;Conflict is to story as sound is to music.&quot;   By what right does Robert McKee preach story structure toKirk Douglas, Diane Keaton and John Cleese? These are somealums of the course he began as a lark at a Hollywoodexperimental school eight years ago and now delivers to 3,000people annually in North America alone.   A 50-year-old theatrical actor and director who turnedscreenwriter and story analyst in Hollywood, Mr. McKee hasyet to see one of his own scripts on the screen. (Mr. McKee,whose father made him analyze Aesop's Fables as a childhoodpunishment, has written televised episodes of &quot;Quincy&quot; and&quot;Columbo,&quot; and has sold 10 film scripts over the past 10years, two of which are now in development.)   Mr. McKee makes no secret of his lack of screen credits;indeed, he makes use of it in the course. In 1990, he says,50,000 screenplays were registered with the Writers Guild; heestimates 250,000 were actually written. Hollywood, afterspending some $500 million annually to option ideas andscripts, produces 400 to 500 movies -- about one for every 20optioned.   To writers who whine that their gems go unbought andunrecognized, he flings unprintable expletives. &quot;Write abrilliant original screenplay and Hollywood's doors flyopen,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a seller's market.&quot; But quality merelygets you into the race, he warns. If Julia Roberts pulls out,or if financing falls through -- well, such are the vagariesof the business.   Screen credits or no, Mr. McKee has something of a cultfollowing. Hollywood brass once registered for the courseunder pseudonyms, but today it is more often worn as a badge.Freddie Fields, who produced &quot;Glory,&quot; says the courseinspired him to start his first screenplay. Quincy Jonesattended, then bought tickets for people at his productioncompany. So did Corbin Bernsen of &quot;LA Law.&quot; One result, Mr.Bernsen says, is that writers at his company, Team CherokeeEntertainment, are now taking more time to craft TV scripts.And rather than merely pitching ideas around Hollywood, they&quot;put them in writing,&quot; a McKee maxim.   On a recent weekend, a capacity crowd shuffles into awindowless auditorium at Hunter College, Mr. McKee's New Yorkvenue. Stand-bys mill around during registration, includingone woman who has driven from Rhode Island in hopes offilling the seat of a no-show.   The audience crackles with anticipation; we have heard theadvance word-of-mouth. And Robert McKee has a compellingstory to tell. It's a riveting -- if exhausting -- journeyinto the dark night of the human soul and back again --transcendentally -- at the climax. It's Schopenhauer andSophocles as well as Schwarzenegger; metaphysics as much asmechanics.   Dogmatic, profane and inspiring by turns, he paces theweekend like a wellcrafted script: punching up material withcomic subplots, skewering pretention and dropping nuggets ofmovie lore (how in &quot;Casablanca,&quot; Bogart wore four-inchplatform shoes to dance with Bergman, and how &quot;Here's lookingat you, kid&quot; is dubbed &quot;To your health&quot; in Italian).   We learn how movie mores evolve with the times, a factthat scriptwriters ignore at their peril. In &quot;Falling inLove,&quot; the relationship between Robert De Niro and MerylStreep was thwarted because they were each married to someoneelse. (Mr. McKee yawns pointedly, saying, &quot;The audiencescreamed inside: `What is their PROBLEM? Dump the stiffs]'&quot;)   He explains that the female audience's empathy with thepsychopath played by Glenn Close in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;surprised the movie's creators, and that she lost thatempathy only after boiling the pet rabbit. &quot;Do anything youwant to a human being,&quot; he says, &quot;but {torture} a bunny andwe drop you like a hot rock.&quot;   We are advised to fall in love with our characters --especially our villains. When the Terminator cuts out his eyewith an X-acto knife and then checks his reflection in themirror and smoothes his hair, the terrifying contradictiongrows out of the writer's &quot;love for her Terminator,&quot; Mr.McKee says.   As we wend our way through text and subtext, the arc ofthe scene, conflict, controlling ideas and plot turns, somebristle at Mr. McKee's curt dismissal of audienceinterruptions. &quot;It's Seven Stages of Enlightenment -- NoQuestions,&quot; mutters one television writer during a break.   Though a few people creep out during the six-hour,frame-by-frame structural analysis of &quot;Casablanca&quot; that windsup the weekend, attrition is otherwise almost nil. And at theclose, after Mr. McKee sings his rendition of &quot;As Time GoesBy,&quot; there's a standing ovation.   &quot;Amazing,&quot; says Mike Shatzkin, a writer and bookpublishing consultant. &quot;My first reaction when it was overwas, `Well, what else would you like to talk to me about forthree days?'&quot;   Mr. McKee, whose company, Two Arts Inc., is based in LosAngeles, does this about two dozen times a year, reapingenough income from the course and his $2,000 private scriptconsultations to qualify as a millionaire. But do hisstudents benefit tangibly as well?   &quot;There's a tendency to see this in the most cynical light-- of the sheep coming to be sheared,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm no fool-- I know that of the 300 people here in New York, if one ortwo screenplays of excellence grew out of this, it would be avery successful course. But that's the nature of art -- theodds are thousands to one against achieving great success.&quot;   In the end, we return to a point he drives home in thelecture with a scene from &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot; In it,Toulouse-Lautrec is showing someone the Venus de Milo. It wasdug up by a farmer, and &quot;no one knows who made it,&quot; theartist says. &quot;But it doesn't matter. For he had the pleasureof doing it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
