Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe was dead on arrival at a suburbanPhilippine military hospital moments after at least two gunmen in astolen car sprayed his vehicle with gunfire as he headed for work,officials said.   Rowe, 51, a native of McAllen, Texas, was a decorated VietnamWar hero who was held in a cage for five years by the Viet Cong asa prisoner of war until he escaped in 1968.   Rowe was chief of the army division at the Joint U.S. MilitaryAdvisory Group headquarters in the Manila suburb of Quezon City.The unit provides training and logistical support to the Philippinemilitary, which is fighting a 20-year communist insurgency.   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but DefenseSecretary Fidel Ramos said Filipino officials believe the killerswere communist rebels. He noted the rebels had threatened to attackU.S. targets unless the United States closed its bases here andstopped aiding Mrs. Aquino's government.   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said in a statement he wasuncertain about the rebels' involvement.   ``But should anyone think that killing this brave officer willalter in any way U.S. policy of support for Philippine democracy,they are wrong,'' he said. ``...This act will only strengthenAmerican resolve to stand with the government and people of thePhilippines led by President Aquino. We will not be deterred byterrorists.''   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater called thekilling ``a cowardly and heinous act.   ``Col. Rowe was in the Philippines to help the Filipino peoplein their efforts to defend democracy,'' Fitzwater said. ``We willwork closely with the Philippine government in their efforts totrack down and bring to justice those responsible for thisassassination.''   Rowe's body, accompanied by his wife, Suzanne, and two children,was flown by helicopter from the hospital to Clark Air Base, 50miles north of Manila. Funeral plans were incomplete.   Rowe's Filipino driver was wounded in the 7 a.m. attack threeblocks from Rowe's office.   Police said up to three cars may have been used in the ambush,but witnesses said they saw only one with at least three men, adriver and two gunmen. One gunman had an M-16 rifle and the other a.45-caliber pistol, they said.   The attack came five days after the communist NationalDemocratic Front warned the rebels were ``determined to make U.S.imperialism pay dearly for the continuing stay of its bases and itsescalating intervention in our people's affairs.''   The statement was issued to claim reponsibility for the bombingof a U.S. communications station in the northern province ofBenguet. No one was hurt in the April 9 bombing.   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipinooutside Clark. The killings caused authorities to increase securityat six U.S. military installations and civilian offices here.   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said futureattacks probably would be against officers assigned to the advisorygroup for which Rowe worked. Soldiers were warned to vary theirroutes to and from work and to tint their car windows to avoiddetection.   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher was asked byreporters in Washington about the safety of Americans in thePhilippines. He noted a U.S. travel advisory issued March 15``indicates areas of the country where, because of criminalactivity or terrorist activity, people should try to avoid.'' Theadvisory states most urban areas in the Philippines includingManila are safe for travelers.   Boucher then was asked if that advisory might be revised. ``I'msure that will be looked at,'' he said. ``I would note that thethreats that I have heard about were against official Americans,and weren't general threats to travelers.''   Rowe was imprisoned in the jungles of Vietnam by the Viet Congfrom October 1963 until he escaped on New Year's Eve 1968. He laterwrote a book about the ordeal titled ``Five Years To Freedom.''   After returning to the United States, he was made chief of theArmy's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape Training unit atFort Bragg, N.C., which included anti-terrorism techniques. Helater served as commander of the 1st Special Warfare TrainingBattalion at Fort Bragg.   Rowe's decorations included the Silver Star, Legion of Merit,two Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts, the Meritorious Service Medal,a National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, anArmy Service Ribbon and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry CrossUnit Citation.</TEXT></DOC>
