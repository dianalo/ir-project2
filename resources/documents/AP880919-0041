Gen. Henry Namphy, who ran the countryfor more than two years.   Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, the army's chief administrativeofficer, went on national television Sunday and declared himselfpresident of the Western hemisphere's most impoverished nation.   He said Namphy was ousted by the 1,000-man Presidential GuardSaturday night because it was ``sickened'' by his rule, which wasmarked by a tolerance for the murder of government opponents.   Avril was a military adviser to Jean-Claude Duvalier before thedictator's February 1986 flight into exile and has since managed toally himself with the prevailing forces in the 7,000-man military.   The government said an unspecified number of soldiers werereported killed in the coup, and Namphy was sent to the DominicanRepublic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.   Port-au-Prince appeared calm Sunday night, though the U.S. andCanadian embassies advised their citizens to stay off the streets.Small groups of people milled in the streets and traffic was light.Television and radio stations resumed their normal programming.   The airport, which was closed Sunday, was expected to reopentoday.   But for the four-month civilian presidency of Leslie Manigat,which ended in June with a bloodless coup, Namphy had run Haitisince Duvalier's departure, heading a military-led junta untilManigat was elected in January in junta-run balloting that waswidely boycotted.   On Nov. 29, independently run elections were thwarted by armedthugs supported by the army who killed 34 people at the polls.   And a week before the coup, about 20 men armed with machetes,handguns and steel pikes attacked a Roman Catholic Church during aMass being celebrated by the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, a vocalcritic of the Namphy government. Thirteen people were killed and 77wounded.   Opposition leaders blamed the government for the attack andanother church burning two days later.   Heavy gunfire was heard in the capital Saturday night shortlybefore the coup, but Susan Clyde, spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassyhere, said ``it appeared to be mainly celebratory shooting in theair, nobody shooting at anyone or anything.''   Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, said anunspecified number of soldiers were killed.   Radio stations reported that at least six people were killed inthe capital in coup-related clashes and that mobs pillaged twohomes owned by Namphy and the home of Port-au-Prince Mayor FranckRomain.   Although motives for the coup were unclear, it appeared thesoldiers and non-commissioned officers of the elite PresidentialGuard were disenchanted with Namphy's authoritarian rule.   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe Presidential Guard had given the army's High Command a list of19 demands for forming a new government, including democraticreform and better living conditions for soldiers.   All the demands were accepted, the diplomat said, except thenomination of Col. Jean-Claude Paul as military commander-in-chief.Paul has been indicted on federal drug-trafficking charges inFlorida.   Paul, commander of the dreaded 700-man Dessaline unit, had beenregarded as the most powerful figure in Haiti after Namphy. It wasnot known if Paul played a part in the coup, but sources said heand Namphy were at odds.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman saidthe United States still wanted Paul extradited to face the drugcharges.   Initial reaction to the coup from advocates of democratic reformwas positive, but cautious.   ``I will support the military government if they say as soon aspossible when they will call elections,'' said Louis Dejoie II,leader of the national Agricultural Industrial Party. ``We areready to speak with any government that respects human rights.''   In his statement to the nation early Sunday, Avril said Haitiwill respect all international treaties, liberties and human rightsand that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake of nationalreconciliation.''   The statement was considered significant because it echoed arecent offer for dialogue from opposition leader Marc Bazin, aconservative leader of the Committee for Democratic Understanding.   Bazin and Dejoie were among four leading candidates forpresident in the Nov. 29 elections and boycotted the elections wonby Manigat.   Dejoie said he expected the military to announce when electionswould be held in the next week or so.   ``They must do it or they won't have any support,'' Dejoie said.``The army right now has to regain its credibility. We want to givethem a chance with this new change of guard.''   Avril has been a key behind-the-scenes figure in a succession ofgovernments since nationwide riots forced Duvalier to flee toFrance. Duvalier had been president since the 1971 death of hisfather, Francois Duvalier, who ruled since 1957.</TEXT></DOC>
