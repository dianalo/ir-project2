Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York City-based companyknown for corporate takeovers, improved its offer Tuesday to $64 ashare for the Cincinnati-based supermarket giant.   The new offer may outweigh Kroger's proposed corporaterestructuring plan and force Kroger's management to give way sothat stockholders can get a better deal, analysts said.   Kroger's management declined Wednesday to make a publicstatement on the newest offer. ``All we've said is, we're reviewingtheir proposal,'' Kroger spokesman Paul Bernish said.   Kohlberg Kravis' offer is its second since it entered the Krogerbidding war two weeks ago with a $4.6 billion bid, offering $58.50per share.   ``I think the purpose of this is a preemptive strike to keepKroger from wasting more time,'' said security analyst Gary Giblenof the Houston investment company Rotan Mosle Inc. ``They're tryingto give Kroger an offer that is so demonstrably superior toanything they (Kroger) can offer that they'll be forced tocapitulate.''   The Haft family of Landover, Md., which controls Dart GroupInc., opened the bidding Sept. 19 with an unsolicited offer of $55per share, or $4.32 billion.   Ryan Mathews, senior editor of the trade publication GroceryMarketing, said Kohlberg's new bid intensifies pressure on Kroger'smanagement because of management's fiduciary duty to stockholders.   ``They can't reject it out of hand,'' Mathews said.   Analyst Elizabeth Shiels of Hilliard Lyons Inc. in Louisville,Ky., said a better offer still could be made.   ``I don't find it as compelling as I would have expected fromKKR,'' she said of Kohlberg's new offer. ``I think Kroger has doneenough public education on the value of the company that this isn'ta hands-down winner.''   The new offer proposes paying $50 in cash, $11 in debentures anda continuing equity interest in the company valued at $3 for eachof Kroger's 78.6 million shares.   The offer tops by $7 a share Kroger's own offer to shareholdersin its board-approved restructuring plan, which would force Krogerto lay off an undetermined number of employees at its headquarters.The company also would sell some supermarkets, convenience stores,mass-merchandising stores and real estate.   The restructuring plan offers shareholders a $40 cash dividend,a debenture with an $8 trading value and equity, or stub stock,estimated at $9 per share, for a total value of $57.   Kohlberg Kravis also presented an alternative offer, in theevent Kroger proceeds with its restructuring, to buy all ofKroger's stub shares for $13.50 each _ $10 in cash and $3.50 indebentures.   Kohlberg Kravis said that would give the shareholders $61.50 pershare _ the $40 cash dividend from Kroger, $10 from Kohlberg and$11.50 in debentures.   The $2.50-per-share difference in Kohlberg's two proposalsrepresents the estimated cost of additional financing fees Krogerwould have to pay if it proceeds with restructuring, plusKohlberg's costs in refinancing the added debt Kroger would incur.   ``We trust you will agree that this extra $2.50 per share invalue should be paid to your shareholders and not to yourlenders,'' Kohlberg Kravis partner George R. Roberts wrote in aletter to Kroger chairman Lyle Everingham.   Kohlberg Kravis said in its first offer that it would keepKroger's headquarters in Cincinnati if it buys the 105-year-oldcompany. The privately held Kohlberg Kravis has controllinginterests in about 30 companies, including Beatrice Cos.,Owens-Illinois, Safeway Stores, Duracell Holdings and Stop andamp; ShopCos.   Fortune magazine estimated the combined 1987 revenues ofKohlberg's companies at $38 billion.   Dart Group has not said whether it would keep Kroger'sheadquarters in Cincinnati.   In response to Kohlberg's newest offer, Dart executive RobertHaft said, ``We would be interested in working with Krogermanagement to enhance their restructuring program by providingadditional equity.'' He did not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
