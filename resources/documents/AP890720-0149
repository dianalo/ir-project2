Chief Visits Namibia</HEAD><BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Territorial officials Thursday freed 24guerrillas described as the last political prisoners in Namibia,and the U.N. secretary-general said the plan for the territory'sindependence is on schedule.   The freed guerrillas of the South-West African People'sOrganization sang a tribal ballad as they emerged from the prisonin Windhoek and were escorted home by nearly 200 supporters, whocheered and jogged with them nearly two miles in a freezing wind.   Eight jailed SWAPO members, including some responsible forbombings that killed more than 30 people, have not been designatedpolitical prisoners and remain jailed.   The U.N. leader, Javier Perez de Cuellar, visited northernNamibia's Ongwediva refugee camp, home to hundreds of people whohave been repatriated by the United Nations. About 1,200 peoplelive in tents in the dry, dusty camp.   Perez de Cuellar also visited a voter registration station andmet with U.N. officials and human rights workers. More than 5,000U.N. military and civilian personnel are in Namibia to monitor ayearlong transition to independence after 74 years of South Africanrule.   Several thousand people, many dressed in the red, green and bluecolors of SWAPO, circled Perez de Cuellar when he arrived at thecamp, a U.N. flag fluttering on the hood of his Mercedes-Benz.   Some held placards claiming harassment by Namibian policemen whoserved on a disbanded paramilitary unit known as Koevoet.   Perez de Cuellar indicated he was pleased with the progress ofthe independence plan, which took effect April 1 and includeselections in November.   But when asked if he was satisfied with the security situationin northern Namibia, he said, ``No, I'm not... We have to fightagainst intimidation and partiality.''   After 23 years of war between SWAPO and South Africanauthorities, local residents are deeply suspicious of Namibianpolice, who remain responsible for law enforcement during thetransition to independence.   Most people in northern Namibia support SWAPO.   No fighting has been reported in northern Namibia since April,but territorial officials claim 1,900 SWAPO guerrillas are insouthernmost Angola, near the Namibian border, in violation of aregional peace accord.   Police in northern Namibia said Thursday that officers uncoveredan arms cache that included a Soviet-made ground-to-air missile,grenades, and assault rifles.   SWAPO denies its fighters are near the border but has not saidwhy thousands of guerrillas remain in Angola when they are allowedto return to Namibia as civilians.   SWAPO also has said it released all 201 detainees that it held.But relatives, and the freed detainees, have said there were nearly2,000 prisoners in SWAPO camps.   In Washington, the assistant secretary of state for African,Herman J. Cohen, suggested Thursday that former President JimmyCarter might go privately to Namibia to observe the Novemberelection.   Cohen noted that Carter observed the election last May inPanama. He was testifying before the subcommittee on Africa of theForeign Affairs Committee in the House of Representatives.Afterward, he told reporters he had not asked Carter about going toNamibia.</TEXT></DOC>
