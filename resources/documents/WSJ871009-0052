The agency said the modified rules affect people who have re-entered the U.S. legally with valid visas after leaving the country for brief periods. The change could benefit an estimated 100,000 illegal immigrants, particularly those from Asia, Europe, Africa and other countries that don't share a border with the U.S. To become eligible for legalization, applicants will have to file for a waiver that will cost $35.    The Immigration Reform and Control Act, which took effect Nov. 6, 1986, requires applicants for legalization to prove they had been residing illegally in the U.S. before Jan. 1, 1982. Applicants are allowed to have left the country for 45 days at a time, not exceeding a total of 180 days.    But so far, the law also has had the effect of making many of those immigrants ineligible for amnesty. The reason is that their return with valid visas made their re-entry legal, so immigration officials considered them no longer illegal immigrants.    The immigration service said the change in regulations came after reviewing &quot;public comments generated by the issue.&quot; But it denied that a pending lawsuit in California had any bearing on the decision.    Immigrant-rights groups have argued that the amnesty program was unfair because it didn't treat all foreigners equally. Unlike Mexicans, for example, who often cross the U.S. border without detection, other illegal immigrants from distant countries must obtain temporary permits at overseas consulates to re-enter the U.S. In many cases, people returning would overstay their visas and fall out of status, making them illegal.    In August, the National Center for Immigrants Rights Inc. and the Asian Law Caucus, both California-based groups of immigrants' rights lawyers, sued the federal agency over the policy. A hearing in federal court in Los Angeles was originally scheduled for Oct. 19 but was delayed to Oct. 26 at the government's request.    Some immigration attorneys praised the change but questioned why it took the agency five months since the amnesty program was started to decide. &quot;The only sad part is that many people who might have been helped by this have given up hope and left the country,&quot; said William Tamayo, a lawyer with the Asian Law Caucus, a public interest law group based in the San Francisco area.    Peter Schey, executive director of the Los Angeles-based National Center for Immigrants Rights Inc. challenged the INS's requirement of the $35 waiver. &quot;We're concerned that the INS will now deny the cases on a one-by-one basis,&quot; he said. &quot;We're not convinced that the waivers are necessary.&quot;    The new change should increase the number of people who have applied for amnesty, particularly along the East Coast, where numbers have been far fewer than expected. An INS spokesman said in New York City, for example, only 21,000 people had applied as of last month, far fewer than the 100,000 that the agency had projected.    Warren R. Leiden, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said his group can now &quot;move forward&quot; with many cases that involve candidates on the East Coast.    As of Tuesday, the agency said 813,000 people had applied for legalization nationwide, and approvals are being granted at a rate in excess of 90%. Verne Jervis, the agency's spokesman, said the INS believes it will reach its projection of two million applicants by May 5, 1988. If those numbers are achieved, he said revenues from application fees will cover the estimated $269 million cost of the program. </TEXT></DOC>
