The recent shutdown of two nuclear energy plantsexacerbates what had already been a tight squeeze. Tokyo madeit through last year's record heat wave with barely akilowatt to spare -- and then only after 400 major steel,auto and other companies agreed to accept electricity cutoffson as little as three hours' notice. Employees of Japan'slargest utility, trying to set an example, kept their airconditioning off despite temperatures in the 90s.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This year,&quot; predicts Teruaki Masumoto of the Federationof Electric Power Companies, &quot;Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka&quot; --the main industrial centers&quot; -- will have a severesituation.&quot;   Government officials and utilities are scrambling tocomplete an emergency blueprint this month that they hopewill avert any power failures come June. The plan includesrestarting mothballed oil-burning generating plants (areversal of the country's energy conservation andenvironmental policies), encouraging major industrialcompanies to generate their own electricity and putting offnuclear plant inspections scheduled during periods of heavydemand.   Most officials insist they'll make it. &quot;We cannotanticipate a hot summer,&quot; says a spokesman for Tokyo ElectricPower Co., the world's largest private utility. &quot;But even inthat case we can supply electricity without blackouts andbrownouts.&quot;   But he and others admit their success depends on a longlist of things they can't control: whether this summer iscooler than the last; whether the economy's rapid growthslows; whether the recent surprising string of nuclear powerplant glitches ends.   &quot;The question is whether there will be another shutdown ofa nuclear power plant,&quot; the Tokyo Electric Power spokesmanadds. &quot;In that case, we will be very scared.&quot;   Indeed, early Thursday morning in Shizuoka Prefecture, apump malfunction forced yet another nuclear reactor shutdown.Officials of Chubu Electric Power Co. said, however, thatthey didn't think it would have any long-term impact, as theclosing came just a week before a previously plannedthree-month shutdown for inspection. A spokesman said itappeared the problem could be fixed during that period.   If Japan gets any bad breaks, the country could faceshortage-induced blackouts and brownouts for the first timesince the energy crises of the 1970s. It is difficult tomeasure the economic burden of any such event, but forcompanies already straining to crank out every car ortelevision set possible, even an unplanned one-hour shutdowncould cost more than $1 million in revenue.   Blackouts and brownouts occur more frequently elsewhere --last summer in the U.S., Washington and Chicago sufferedblackouts and brownouts. But the Japanese government andindustry's &quot;credibility for having a stable supply ofelectricity . . . may deteriorate,&quot; says Tatsuya Terazawa, adeputy director at the natural resources and energy agency ofthe Ministry of International Trade and Industry.   There's a certain irony to the concern about energy.Japan, more than any other nation, responded to the oilshocks of the 1970s by overhauling industrial practices andis often cited as a model of energy efficiency. The end ofthe Persian Gulf crisis, meanwhile, ended any immediatethreat to Japan's major source of energy.   Despite all that, the electricity crunch is just anotherexample of Japan's overburdened infrastructure failing tokeep pace with its breathtaking growth. The major utilities,criticized for keeping excess capacity, scaled backinvestment at the same time electricity demand was racingahead at nearly 7% a year.   Concurrent with the nation's industrial expansion, theJapanese citizenry was improving its standard of living. Forexample, Japan now averages nearly one air conditioner --  amajor drain on summer electricity -- for each home, up fromabout one for every two households in 1980.   Spooked by the unusual heat and electricity demand lastsummer, MITI and 10 major utilities huddled last fall toprepare for this year. They were confident their plans forstretching supplies while easing demand were enough -- untilFeb. 9.   That Saturday afternoon, a broken tube and a failed valvetriggered a release on an emergency cooling system at anuclear power plant in Mihama, near Kyoto, and forced anindefinite shutdown of the reactor. Similar defects werefound in a nearby plant in Takahama, forcing that plant toclose March 21.   The Mihama incident released little if any radiation andwas similar to a handful of little-publicized incidents inthe U.S. in recent years. But it was viewed as a disaster inJapan, which has a much better safety record than the U.S.and Europe. The Mihama plant may be closed for more thanthree years for repairs. The Takahama plant will probably beshut through the summer. Those are only the most serious of ahalf-dozen nuclear incidents reported in Japan in the pasttwo months.   The two shuttered plants feed the Kansai region, Japan'ssecond largest industrial area and its mostnuclear-dependent. The region is bracing for a crunch thatcould also affect other areas. Last summer, Tokyo coped withthe unusual demand by importing electricity from areasblessed with small surpluses, a move that included KansaiElectric Power Co. This year, Kansai isn't expected to shareanything and could even compete with Tokyo for any excesssupply.   On the positive side, new plants in Tokyo and Kansai arecoming on stream this year. And the National Weather Agencyis forecasting an &quot;average&quot; summer -- but it said that lastyear as well.   While the tight electricity supply became apparent lastyear, it will take about five years to build enough plants tocreate a cushion. And building that base will be difficultprecisely because of the nuclear shutdowns that helped createthe pinch.   Opposition to nuclear energy has been growing in Japan.Government officials, who want to double the number ofnuclear plants by the year 2010, haven't gained localapproval for a new site in years. The current spate ofincidents has shaken public confidence further. Yesterday,five activists filed suit in Tokyo District Court demandingthat Tokyo Electric Power stop its No. 3 reactor at theFukushima plant in northern Japan to protect residents. Thereactor was shut temporarily in January 1989 after a coolingpump malfunctioned and a broken part was found. TokyoElectric said it was satisfied it had done its best to ensuresafety at the plant.   For the short term, Japanese officials are looking foralternatives to nuclear energy. But vows to stabilizecarbon-dioxide emissions by the year 2000, as well asdetermination to boost energy independence, make a nuclearbuildup necessary, officials say.   &quot;We believe strongly that nuclear energy is a reliablesource of energy,&quot; says MITI's Mr. Terazawa. &quot;We really seeno alternatives.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
