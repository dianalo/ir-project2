ShedsNearly Half of StoresIn Bid to Turn Profit</HL><DD> 12/29/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DNNR CNS </IN><DATELINE> INDIANAPOLIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Danners Inc. said it shed nearly half of its 35 remaining discount stores in a move that should permit it to turn profitable next year.    The retailer said Consolidated Stores International Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, plans to operate 17 of the 3D discount stores in Indiana and Illinois after it liquidates the Danners inventory in them and assumes or renegotiates the leases. The 18 other stores, located in Indiana and Michigan, will continue under Danners's management, the company said.    Danners said the deal should permit it to be profitable next year &quot;provided a satisfactory arrangement with creditors can be developed.&quot; The company has been in default on terms of about $20 million in bank loans, but Robert Bolsinger, vice president for finance, said liquidation of the 17 stores is part of a debt restructuring plan approved by lenders.    In fiscal 1986, ended Feb. 1, the company had a loss of $529,000, compared with profit of $238,000, or 49 cents a share, the year before. Sales fell to $171.3 million from $189 million in fiscal 1985. The company reported a loss of about $7.7 million for the 39-week period ended Nov. 1, with the bulk of the red ink coming in write-downs for a discontinued restaurant operation and because of a switch in October to an &quot;everyday low pricing&quot; policy in the discount stores.    Mr. Bolsinger wouldn't predict whether Danners will be profitable in the fiscal fourth quarter. &quot;Christmas sales have been reasonably good, and we feel December will be a profitable month,&quot; he said, but it's impossible to determine if store-liquidation costs will offset those gains. </TEXT></DOC>
