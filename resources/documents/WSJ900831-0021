Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein put new bureaucratic obstaclesin the path of the Western women and children he had promisedcould leave Iraq and Kuwait earlier this week. StateDepartment spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the newrestrictions &quot;inhumane and disgraceful.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   As the standoff between the U.S. and Iraq continued,President Bush said at a White House press conference, &quot;It isimportant that the considerable burden of the effort beshared by those being defended and those who benefit from thefree flow of oil.&quot;   He said that the administration is calling on Japan, SouthKorea, West Germany, Saudi Arabia and the oil-rich Gulfstates to provide financial and energy resources to help meetthe cost of deploying troops and to assist nations such asTurkey, Egypt and Jordan, which are suffering economically asa result of the sanctions. Mr. Bush plans to dispatchSecretary of State James Baker to Europe and the Gulf andTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to Asia to spearhead the&quot;consulting and coordinating effort.&quot;   President Bush added, &quot;There's no total price tag I havein mind&quot; for the effort.   But the president also said, &quot;U.S. forces should neverappear to be mercenary forces, and that will not be theoutcome of this, I can guarantee you.&quot;   Japan announced a wide-ranging assistance package earlierthis week that it said had a value of $1 billion, but Mr.Bush indicated at his news conference that he would bepushing Tokyo for more.   Responding to the president's call, Sulaiman Mutawa, theexiled Kuwaiti minister of planning, said his country has&quot;made a straightforward commitment&quot; to pick up part of thecost of the military efforts under way in the Middle East.&quot;The precise numbers haven't been thrashed out,&quot; he said.&quot;But our government stands ready to provide economicsupport.&quot;   Ms. Tutwiler said Iraq now is demanding that foreign womenand children write letters stating that they want to departand that the letters must be translated into Arabic. Inaddition, she said, the Iraqis are demanding that the lettersbear a stamp from unspecified &quot;appropriate fiscalauthorities&quot; showing that all Iraqi taxes have been paid.   Iraqi officials earlier had asked for a list of those whowish to depart. Such a list hasn't yet been provided by U.S.embassy personnel in Baghdad.   Privately, a State Department official said that someAmericans being held hostage by Iraq may be reluctant tocomply with the procedures. The official said that some ofthe women hostages are worried that providing the informationcould inadvertently reveal the whereabouts of their husbands,who haven't been told they can leave.   At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Bush said, &quot;I feelvery concerned about Americans that are held against theirwill.&quot; But he added: &quot;We cannot permit hostage-taking toshape the foreign policy of this country, and I won't permitit to do that.&quot;   The president also said he doesn't anticipate &quot;majorimbalances in the oil market,&quot; adding that the U.S. StrategicPetroleum Reserve was &quot;available if it is truly needed.&quot; Hevowed that U.S. efforts would &quot;go on as long as it takes&quot; toforce Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and release its foreignhostages. He dismissed suggestions that U.S. costs beunderwritten by a war tax.   Mr. Bush praised the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries for being willing to increase output to offset theloss of oil supplies created by the isolation of Iraq.   During his press conference, Mr. Bush stated several timesthat &quot;we have no argument with the people of Iraq.&quot; AlthoughMr. Bush doesn't list toppling Saddam Hussein as one hisgoals, U.S. officials are hoping that the UnitedNations-backed economic sanctions and military show of forcewill create sufficient domestic pressures to lead to theIraqi dictator's downfall. Mr. Bush said &quot;it wouldn'tdisappoint me&quot; if the Iraqi people conclude that SaddamHussein was the cause of their problems. The president'sremarks came as U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez deCuellar arrived in Jordan for talks today with Iraq's foreignminister, Tariq Aziz.   President Bush also expressed support for the Kuwaitiresistance and &quot;anybody that can have a hand in restoringlegitimacy there to Kuwait.&quot;   He acknowledged that economic measures against Iraq may behurting civilians in that country more than the government,but he said: &quot;There's nothing that's painless.&quot; He dismissedSaddam Hussein's suggestions that he, Mr. Bush and BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher have a debate. &quot;You can putan empty chair there {for me},&quot; the president said.</TEXT></DOC>
