 Thatgroup is looking at partnerships and other things to make sure we're fullycompliant over the long term with government expectations.andP;  If we're notahead of the game, we're at least in parallel with it.andM;GCN: How do you get around the perception that NetWare is more proprietarythan Microsoft Corp.andP;  Lan Manager because it is not as widely licensed toother vendors?andM;NOORDA: I think it's a perception that's been encouraged by Microsoft becauseof its relationship with IBM.andP;  Actually, if you look at the number oforiginal equipment manufacturers [OEMs] we have, it's larger thanMicrosoft's.andP;  The perception is that LAN Manager is widely licensable, butthe fact is that it's not very shippable.andM;Because LAN Manager hasn't become very popular and because there's stronginterest by government and major corporations in NetWare, many of the OEMsalso are working with us through a Portable NetWare environment or a nativeenvironment.andM;We work with them to provide a port, and they can sell it.andP;  But they don'thave to prepay anything.andP;  Part of the hook with LAN Manager is that you haveto prepay.andM;GCN: Is Novel committed to complete protocol independence?andM;NOORDA: Yes, absolutely.andP;  It's only a question of time and priorities.andO;Interfacing with LAN Manager hasn't been a top priority [for Novell] becauseLAN Manager isn't that well-established yet.andM;GCN: It hasn't been a desire to shut Microsoft out?andM;NOORDA: Not at all.andP;  Our intent is to grow this segment of the business, togrow it ahead of our own business.andP;  Our mission from the beginning has beenthat growing the industry is more important than anything else.andM;GCN: You can pull Mac compatibility, GOSIP protocols, OS/2 into NetWare 386.andO;But do people think native code still performs better and than maybe anoperating system tightly integrating GOSIP protocols would have apsychological advantage over non-native or add-on software?andM;NOORDA: Going back to portable vs.andP;  native, it depends on how well the portis done.andP;  You may have to leave out some of the functions in a portableenvironment, but I think the overall portability issue is making sure thelocal area networks are connected.andM;Portable NetWare provides the connectivity, many of the same functions itwould have under a native environment, and in many cases even theperformance.andP;  It depends on how much they put in it to tune it.andM;In general, you would expect performance to be less than under a nativeenvironment.andP;  With NetWare 386, almost anything you call a NetWare loadablemodule [NLM] is going to get a level of performance you would expect out ofthe 386.andP;  It is a shared-processor environment.andM;GCN: Some companies, Apple being a prime example, try to say to thegovernment that specifying nativeness is not reasonable, that you should specfunctionality and the performance you want.andP;  Specifying native is maybe anold-fashioned idea from when non-native automatically meant lowerperformance.andM;NOORDA: We're working with Mips Computer Systems on port environment.andP;  To getmaximum value out of their reduced-instruction-set-computing chip set, a moreeffective way is to put NetWare into a native environment, so they'reconsidering doing that as well.andM;There you would see a reverse, where NetWare is the native and Unix becomesan NLM environment.andP;  It's a question of what you want.andM;GCN: What did you hope to achieve with the proposed merger of Novell andLotus Development Corp.?andP;  To what extent was it a proposal to provide systemsintegration to ease interoperability problems?andM;NOORDA: In many cases the customer calls us, believing their problem is anetworking problem.andP;  In fact, we discover theu really didn't understand theapplication, or maybe the application wasn't ported as well as they wouldlike.andP;  So we send them back to the applications people.andP;  Pretty soon we getcalled back again.andM;The minicomputer people, or anybody with a proprietary set of hardware andsoftware, have an easier time taking the call.andP;  With the diffision ofresponsibility that's going on, it's more complicated.andM;So we said, we'll take a lead in that.andP;  We're working with several others,Word-Perfect and Lotus, and we will continue.andP;  That's not going to change.andM;We've had a number of marketing discussions with Lotus about Notes and otherproducts.andP;  It was suggested that it would make some sense to merge otheractivities on a more formal basis.andP;  I still think it was a good idea, and I'mdisappointed it didn't take place.andM;GCN: Do you see the joint-service agreement idea as continuing in some form?andO;It was announced that Word-Perfect, Lotus and Novell were trying to gettogether on service calls.andM;NOORDA: That will continue.andP;  We've started a program where we can take a calland rather than send it to the applications people, we tie in to theapplications people and keep the customer on the line until we all decidewhat the problem is and get it solved.andM;The mahor end users would like to deal with as few people as possible.andP;  Butthere aren't whole lot of one-stop shops in the software business.andP;  So we'vesaid, leths try to do some joint marketing programs, some announcements aboutdirections.andM;GCN: Are the support problems that led to the attempted merger fewer in thefederal than the commercial market?andM;NOORDA: In the federal environment, the systems integrators are verycompetent.andP;  They have to be.andP;  They have to work against huge masses of date.andO;The government procurement process requires the integrator to understand allproducts, to be able to integrate those products and to sell to a very largecustomer dispersed around the world.andM;We feel fortunate that we have strong federal resellers who are verycompetent, cognizant of how the products work.andM;GCN: Do you see government standards developed by standards bodies as being adrag on technology, or as a real value to government and commercial users?andM;NOORDA: If you were to think about standards in the context of when we gotstarted, it would seem a real drag because you would never get anything done.andM;It's important that standards be set by large companies.andP;  IBM has a largeenough influence to do that.andP;  The government, because of its interoperabilityrequirements, has to set standards, but it takes a long time.andM;GCN: Novell is not carrying its own General Services Administration schedulenow.andP;  Is it too early to tell how this is affecting your government business?andM;NOORDA: Novell's strategy for some time has been to support the channelsthrough which we sell -- OEMs, distributions, system integrators, value-addedresellers.andM;As we analyzed it last year, the GSA schedule was competing with our ownchannels we had set up.andP;  So far the response we're seeing is that sales areup.andP;  The Washington office now is the No.andP;  1-selling office in the country.andO;Last year it was not.andM;GCN: What would you tell government specifiers who are trying to decide whatto do about LANs and what LAN architectures to evaluate and buy?andM;NOORDA: I'd say, get educated first.andP;  Talk to users who have been there.andO;Don't build your request for proposals on the basis of what you read in theliterature.andP;  Talk to users.andM;We offer free seminars in the Herndon, Va., office twice a month to any enduser, federal or commercial.andP;  We also offer them [in downtown Washington] alittle less frequently.andP;  The seminars basically tell people what a LAN is,what the options are, how to configure it.andM;GCN: Banyan Systems Inc. Vines and 3Com Corp.'s 3+share operting systems madesome hay out of the domain naming scheme.andP;  when do you expect Novell willhave that beat?andM;NOORDA: Banyan did a very important job early on when it built Vines aroundexisting Unix technology.andP;  We started at a different end.andP;  We said, let'smake sure local area networks are really good.andM;The machines we had to work with on the desktop were pretty simple.andP;  Wedidn't have the interrupt structure or all the things the new chip setsprovide.andP;  So we came up from the bottom and Vines came down from the top.andM;While we were moving proprietary stuff into the bottom end, Banyan was movingit into the top end.andP;  We'll converge.andP;  We've always been moving in thatdirection.andM;With the increasing capability we have at the communications server, with theglobal naming service that becomes part of that, it really starts to looklike the total picture.andM;I think over the next couple of years you'll see the global naming servicebecome a non-issue because it will be embedded in the whole structure, and wewill be dealing with all environments.andM;We are able now to interface with IBM's Systems Network Architecture andSystems Application Architecture, even to access Office Vision.andM;GCN: Mini sales are down.andP;  Some people say you're largely responsible.andP;  Doyou see that level of computing going away as the micro server gets morepowerful?andM;NOORDA: On a percentage basis, I think it will become a smaller part.andP;  Butthere's inertia in everything.andP;  The mainframe business will be aroundforever, depending on how you define it -- a repository of nothing else.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
