Robin Wright, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment ofInternational Peace who recently visited Iran, said in an interviewWednesday that Iran wants an opening to the West because ofeconomic hardship brought on by the prolonged war against Iraq aswell as declining oil prices.   ``Iran clearly needs to open the door again,'' Wright said,adding that after Iran's recent normalization of relations withFrance, ``Britain is going to be next and then Canada.''   She said that before last Sunday's incident, Iranian officialssounded hopeful about the possibility of an eventual accommodationwith the United States.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said earlier this week thatbefore the airliner was shot down, Iranian officials had sentmessages through third parties indicating a desire to open a directdialogue with the United States.   But Shultz said it is not clear whether the messages were sentby officials in positions of authority.   U.S. officials believe that the Iranian government may bedivided on the question of improved relations, with a somesupporting Iran's anti-U.S. Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemiand others rallying behind more moderate elements.   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley saidWednesday the United States is willing to open an ``authoritativedialogue'' with Iran but U.S. efforts to explore this possibility``have not borne fruit.''   This has been a long-standing U.S. position, but received littleattention until the U.S. Navy warship Vincennes shot down theIranian passenger plane, killing all 290 persons aboard.   In any case, Mrs. Oakley said there can be no normalrelationship with Iran so long as the Iran-Iraq war does not end,American hostages continue to be held by pro-Iranian militants inLebanon, and Iran does not halt what she described as internationalterrorist activities. For its part, Iran has called Sunday'sincident ``cold-blooded murder'' and an act of internationalterrorism by the United States.   Wright said that military incidents have repeatedly thwartedfledgling efforts by the United States and Iran to improverelations.   As an example, she said that Iranian officials told her thatPresident Carter in the spring of 1980 expressed a willingness torecognize Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution but shortly thereafterapproved a military mission to rescue the American hostages inTehran. The mission ended in failure.   There have been reports that administration officials believedthat Iran might attempt to take advantage of the current U.S.presidential campaign to advance its diplomatic goals.   The Wall Street Journal reported on June 10 that Robert Oakley,the National Security Council's Middle East expert, had written aninternal memo warning of that possibility.   The article said that Oakley was concerned that Iran might tryto entice Vice President George Bush, the presumed Republicancandidate, into a deal involving the release of nine Americanhostages in return for a less hostile stance toward Iran.   There also has been speculation that Iran may be attempting tospread word of its interest in improved ties with the United Statesas a means of shaking the confidence of Iraq and its Arab allies inthe gulf.   One of the prime purposes of the U.S. military deployment in thegulf is to provide reassurance to Iran's neighbors, many of whichlook upon Iran as an expansionist power.</TEXT></DOC>
