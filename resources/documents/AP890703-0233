Forty-one innocent bystanders were reported shot in New York, LosAngeles, Washington and Boston in 1986, and 20 of them died. In 1988that number leaped to 135 shot and 37 killed, according to a studyby Lawrence W. Sherman, a University of Maryland professor ofcriminology.   Overall, in those three years, 250 innocent bystanders were shot,of whom 71 were killed and 179 wounded.   ``Homicide in America is becoming more barbaric,'' Sherman said.``We may not expect honor among thieves, but we do expect some honoramong killers. The growing contempt for accidental victims is evenindicated by he name killers give them: `mushrooms' who `pop up' inthe line of fire.''</TEXT><TEXT>   UNDATED _ Flood waters kept hundreds from their homes today inthree Southern states, and a storm packing 90 mph winds raced acrossTexas, uprooting trees and chasing Shakespearean actors from anoutdoor stage in Dallas.

Families that tilled the orchards and fields for unknowngenerations have disappeared. The silence is broken by an occasionalburst of gunfire or a military convoy roaring through the valleyswhere shattered villages cling to the 15,000-foot mountains like animage of Armageddon.   What happened to villages like Lalma, Babagilala, Babamardan andBabashangrul will not be known until the war between the governmentand Moslem guerrillas ends and accounts can be pieced together fromvillagers who escaped.   After a decade of war, the barbarity has become widely known. Butin the Hindu Kush mountains, along the river valleys and across theplains where the armies of Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan oncemarched, the scenes of devastation go beyond what was previouslyknown about the conflict.</TEXT></DOC>
