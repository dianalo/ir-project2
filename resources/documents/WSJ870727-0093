Little Inc. said its board voted unanimously to reject Plenum Publishing Corp.'s $50-a-share bid to acquire the consulting firm.    Arthur D. Little said that in making its decision, its board considered, among other things, the opinion of the company's financial adviser, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., that Plenum's offering price is &quot;inadequate.&quot;    The company added that &quot;a number of clients, as well as current and retired staff members, expressed concerns about the potential adverse impacts from any loss of the company's independence.&quot;    New York-based Plenum didn't have any immediate comment. The publisher of scientific journals made an unsolicited proposal earlier this month to acquire Arthur D. Little for an indicated $128 million.    As previously reported, the bid may be difficult to complete if the company's employees oppose it because professional staffs constitute the most valuable assets of consulting firms.    Separately, Arthur D. Little's board authorized the company to enter into severance agreements with officers, managers and profit-sharing participants. The agreements would give six months to 18 months salary to approximately 700 employees affected if they leave their jobs under certain circumstances following a change of control of the company, Arthur D. Little said. The firm has about 2,600 employees, about 1,200 of which are consultants, a company spokesman said.    In national over-the-counter trading, Arthur D. Little's stock closed Friday at $44 a share, up $1.50.    Plenum's bid was made both to Arthur D. Little itself and to Memorial Drive Trust, a profit-sharing trust for Little employees that controls 75% of the consulting firm's stock. A spokesman for Arthur D. Little said the trust hasn't replied yet to Plenum's offer. Trust officials couldn't be reached.    The trust is headed by a four-member board of trustees, one of whom is John Magee, Arthur D. Little's chairman and chief executive officer, the spokesman said. The other three members are outsiders. </TEXT></DOC>
