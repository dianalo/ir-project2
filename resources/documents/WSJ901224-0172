But thebenefits come from new manufacturing techniques -- not thewaste and emission treatment encouraged by much environmentallegislation.   And the benefits could be huge. U.S. manufacturing wastescan be halved by using existing technologies, thecongressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates.Eliminating another 25% would require research anddevelopment.   It's difficult to estimate the savings achievable throughsuch manufacturing changes. But roughly $75 billion a year isbeing spent on waste and emission treatment, and recentclean-air legislation may eventually add another $25 billionif companies stick to business as usual.   &quot;This is money down the tube. If industry reduces waste10%, that's $10 billion in savings. That's just the start,&quot;says Michael Overcash, a professor at North Carolina StateUniversity in Raleigh who studies the issue for theEnvironmental Protection Agency.   Moreover, American companies produce five times the wasteper dollar of goods sold compared with Japanese companies andmore than twice that of the Germans, according to JoelHirschhorn, a former official of the Office of TechnologyAssessment who now heads an environmental-technologiesconsulting firm. &quot;Waste reduction can have a staggeringeffect on the bottom lines of American companies&quot; and canimprove their world-wide competitiveness, he says.   Here are some savings that companies are alreadyachieving:   -- Carrier Corp. spent $500,000 in 1988 to eliminate toxiclubricants from its manufacture of air conditioners -- andslashed annual production costs by $1.2 million.   -- American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. recently cut about$3 million of annual costs by ridding its circuit-boardmanufacture of an ozone-depleting compound.   -- Whyco Chromium Co. says a new alloy that it developedto eliminate harmful byproducts from its process for coatingnuts and screws has trimmed the cost 25%.   -- And 3M Corp. estimates that manufacturing changes tocontrol pollution have saved it $41 million in the past threeyears.   Of course, not all environmental pollution can besuppressed by manufacturing changes alone. Some measure ofpollution-control technologies will be required to treatsludge, municipal garbage, and emissions from automobiles andutilities.   But few companies seem willing to try &quot;clean&quot; technologiesthat address the very source of pollution because of up-frontrisks and research and development costs associated withuntried approaches, Mr. Hirschhorn says. &quot;It's easier forcompanies to resort to easy and low-risk waste-reductionprojects. But that only adds costs.&quot;   That's no surprise to James Gustave Speth, president ofthe World Resources Institute, a not-for-profitpolicy-research center that expects to issue a study on theeconomics of environmental technologies next month. &quot;Ourwhole history of environmental regulations has been one ofimposing end-of-the-pipe standards which manufacturers meetwith end-of-the-pipe technologies. We have never encouraged arapid diffusion of technologies that prevent pollution in thefirst place,&quot; he says.   The result: million-dollar scrubbers to treat toxicemissions from power companies' chimneys; expensiveincineration plants to treat hazardous wastes; recyclingtechnologies for coolants used in cars and refrigerators;special catalytic converters to cleanse toxicautomobile-tailpipe emissions, and elaborate arrangements tohaul waste to disposal sites.   Yet technologies already available can do away withexpensive &quot;control&quot; measures. Among these are employingcarbon dioxide and other gases to spray paint rather thanusing solvent as the medium; sanding and other mechanicalmeans for stripping paint; batteries that don't use toxicchemicals (as introduced last year by Polaroid Corp.); andjet-engine combustion techniques that utility power plantscan use to reduce as much as 80% of the harmful nitrogenoxides that now must be tamed with ammonia and expensivecatalysts (a technology General Electric Co. is developing).   Carrier, for example, decided in 1987 to adopt &quot;clean&quot;technologies. In manufacturing air conditioners, the biggestsource of hazardous wastes is the &quot;degreasing&quot; line. There,copper and aluminum parts pass through tanks of solvents tobe cleaned of oils and debris accumulated during cutting andsoldering.   The United Technologies Corp. unit first developed anontoxic lubricant that evaporated. Next, it fine-tuned itscutting presses to cut metal coils more precisely, with lessfriction and less waste. (In the past, high friction in thecutting press was countered by lubricating the metal.) Thecompany also designed air conditioners with fewer parts,reducing the need to cut and rejoin metal.   The result: Carrier eliminated the &quot;degreasing&quot; line,increased automation, reduced scrap and eliminated down time.&quot;We also improved overall quality of our product,&quot; saysGerald Bailey, Carrier's director of environmental health andsafety. With fewer joints, the air conditioners leak less, hesays.   ATandamp;T had traditionally cleaned soldering debris and rosinsfrom circuit boards with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), whichare believed to deplete the earth's protective ozone layer.Although several environmental services offer equipment torecycle CFCs, ATandamp;T has been installing new cleaning linesthat use solutions similar to household detergents.   With the new solutions, cleaning a square foot of boardcosts 15 cents, compared with 25 cents with CFC. The newsolutions, however, must still be treated before disposal.But by switching to a rosin that is completely harmless andevaporates, ATandamp;T expects to &quot;eliminate entirely the cost ofcleaning,&quot; says George Wenger, of ATandamp;T's materials andprocess group.   Mr. Wenger says environmental standards are tightening sorapidly that ATandamp;T believes that complying is going to becomeincreasingly expensive. &quot;Our attitude is that rather thanwait and see how hard it will be,&quot; he says, &quot;let's adopt newtechnologies that will put us in good competitive position inthe long run.&quot;   Even at companies that must continue resorting topollution treatment as well, the preventive approach cangenerate substantial savings. For example, 3M estimates thatits 2,500 different manufacturing changes since 1975 haveproduced total net savings of $500 million while halving itstoxic emissions.   Thomas Zosel, manager of 3M's pollution-preventionprograms, argues that such savings call for flexibleenforcement of the regulations. He suggests that the EPAcould allow additional time for compliance for companiestrying out innovative manufacturing technologies.&quot;Regulations currently don't allow that,&quot; he says.   Whyco Chromium, which coats nuts and bolts and otherautomobile fasteners for corrosion resistance, would like tospend more time improving manufacturing methods than treatingits effluents. Two years ago, the Thomaston, Conn., companydeveloped an organic compound that required only two to threecoats, half as many as the previous nickel-cadmium-coppercompound. It reorganized its plant with new equipment, butmost of the &quot;several hundred thousand dollars in investmentwas in research and development,&quot; says Mark Hyner, president.   And research, he says, is something his small companycan't afford under the pressure of compliance deadlines.&quot;Most of our time and resources are spent dealing withregulations. I would love for somebody from the EPA to comein and say `Let's see how we can do things differently' orfor the government to offer tax incentives for innovativetechnologies,&quot; he says. Mr. Hyner says his company, whose1989 sales totaled $13 million, spends $2 million annually ontreating and hauling wastes and maintaining a staff thatoversees environmental compliance.   At the EPA, David Berg, director of technology innovationand economics, says the agency is evaluating how &quot;the currentenvironmental legislation creates disincentives&quot; forcompanies to undertake pollution-prevention technologies. Hisoffice is expected to make recommendations to the EPAadministrator this winter.   Under consideration, he says, are &quot;waivers&quot; that wouldgive companies that risk innovative technologies additionaltime for compliance. Another proposal is to establish&quot;national centers&quot; where environmental consequences of a newmanufacturing process could be tested without an EPA permit,which now &quot;costs companies money and time,&quot; he says.   Another fundamental consideration also keeps manycompanies from adopting &quot;clean&quot; manufacturing technologies. Aswitch-over requires manufacturers to make design and otherchanges in products whose &quot;specifications&quot; have long beenestablished by their customers. Small to middle-levelmanufacturers that supply parts and components are reluctantto change those specifications even though this wouldn'taffect product quality, says Bobbie Pettit, who directsproduct testing at Premier Chemical Co., a Burke, Va.,concern that is developing environmentally safe solvents.&quot;The suppliers are afraid that if they make manufacturingchanges, their customers won't buy,&quot; she says.   The outcome of the conflicting pressures will depend uponwhether companies see pollution prevention as productivityimprovement. &quot;That directs attention to improvingmanufacturing efficiency in ways not looked at before,&quot; saysMr. Overcash at North Carolina State.   ---                   Cleaning Up Pays Off                                                                                                          Unexpected corporate benefits of environmental compliance                                                                                                        COMPANY           MANUFACTURING CHANGE           BENEFIT                                                                                                        ATandamp;T            Redesigned               Eliminated use                 circuit-board cleaning   of ozone-depleting                 process                  chemicals, slashed                                          cleaning costs by                                          annually                                                                                                        Carrier         Revamped metal cutting,  Eliminated toxic                 and redesigned air       solvents, cut                 conditioner parts        manufacturing cost                                          $1.2 million                                          annually                                                                                                        Clairol         Switched to foam balls   Reduced waste                 from water to flush      water 70%, saving                 pipes in hair-care       $240,000 annually                 product manufacturing    in disposal costs                                                                                                        W.R.
