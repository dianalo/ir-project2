Beginning full committee action on the $295.6 billion Pentagonbudget for fiscal 1990, the Democratic-controlled panel did sidewith Bush on some issues.   It rejected an amendment introduced by Rep. Ron Dellums,D-Calif., to terminate the Midgetman missile program. And it votedto restore $71 million for the Lance missile and other short-rangeattack weapons _ money that had been cut by a subcommittee.   By voice vote, the full committee approved a $3.5 billion budgetfor the Strategic Defense Initiative, considerably less than the$4.6 billion Bush had proposed for the Star Wars program to developlasers and other weapons to stop enemy nuclear missiles.   The committee decision came just two months after DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney, in slashing $10 billion from the budget, hadalready cut $1 billion in proposed Star Wars spending. The committeeaction, if supported in later votes in the House and Senate, wouldtake $1.1 billion more.   By a 39-12 vote largely along party lines, the committee rejectedan amendment by Rep. Jon L. Kyl, R-Ariz., to accept Cheney'sspending level for Star Wars.   ``I believe the American people will support a strong, robust SDIprogram,'' Kyl told his committee colleagues before the amendmentwas defeated.   One of Cheney's most controversial budget decisions was scuttlingthe Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, a revolutionary aircraft designed totake off like a helicopter and fly like a plane.   His move met with stiff opposition in Congress where last weekReps. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., succeeded inpersuading the Research and Development Subcommittee to approve anamendment to pump $351 million into the program by taking money thathad been earmarked for the radar-evading B-2 stealth bomber.   Rep. William L. Dickinson, R-Ala., introduced an amendment torestore some of the funds for the bomber. But Weldon argued that theamendment ``in effect kills the V-22.'' His argument succeeded asthe committee voted 31-19 to reject Dickinson's amendment.   The vote leaves $2.7 billion in procurement funds for the B-2bomber and cuts the proposed $1.8 billion for research anddevelopment to about $1.5 billion.   Three committee members _ Reps. John Kasich, R-Ohio; JohnRowland, R-Conn., and Dellums _ plan to introduce an amendmentWednesday to eliminate all money for the aircraft, which isconsidered one of the most expensive in history at a cost of between$500 million and $650 million a copy.   After the committee rejected the administration's requestedfigure for Star Wars Tuesday, Kasich proposed spending $3.8 billionplus inflation on SDI, reaching that level by cutting added itemsincluding a proposed $200 million for the National Aerospace Plane.The high-speed transport could fly around the world in two hours.   Kasich's amendment lost 32-15, largely along party lines.   The panel didn't take up other Star Wars amendments, reasoningthat there was no need to engage in rancorous debate at this pointover an issue that is expected to reach the House floor for fulldiscussion next month.   At that time, Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., plans to introduce anamendment cutting Star Wars to $3.1 billion, and Dellums, chairmanof the subcommittee, plans a measure limiting fiscal 1990 funds to$1.3 billion for SDI.   Dellums said that based on ``the reality over the past fewyears,'' the research and development total for Star Wars willlikely be cut on the House floor to $2.8 billion.   The committee on Tuesday also rejected a surprise amendment byRep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., to eliminate money for the Army's lightattack helicopter, commonly known as the LHX.   ``Santa Claus should not come to town every day,'' Hopkins saidin response to arguments that funds for Army research anddevelopment projects were drastically low and the service deserved amodernized force.   His amendment failed, 41-8.   In approving the research and development budget, the panel alsoapproved $50 million for the Defense Advance Research ProjectsAgency to spend on high definition television. The agency has $10million available annually for the program during the next threeyears.   Earlier, the full House committee approved the Seapower andStrategic and Critical Materials Subcommittee's budget of about $14billion for shipbuilding, two additional mine-sweepers and otheritems.</TEXT></DOC>
