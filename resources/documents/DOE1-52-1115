Combinedcycle power generation has earlier been tried successfully in West Germany.In order to select right technology keeping in view the peculiar qualityof Indian coals, an endeavour has been made to cover the advanced stageR andamp; D programme initiated by some other organizations also. Work of Westinghouse,Foster Wheeler and U-Gas among others has been discussed in detail besidesthe other developing technologies by KBW, Institute of Power, Warsawand VEW Coal Conversion, West Germany. Studies conducted at CFRI on pressuregasification of Indian coals for generation of gas suitable for powergeneration and other purposes have also been focused upon and resultsof systematic tests of several typical Indian coals with variation ofash and volatile matter are further processed and presented in the paper.Estimates have been provided for consumption figures of raw materialsand air pollutant emissions in an IGCC plant which are lower comparedto conventional steam power plant. Similarly, IGCC performance relatedto mode/media of gasification, comparison of power generation systems,improvement in efficiency for combined cycles, material balance estimates,economics of the process, payback period and relative cost of power havealso been covered. 27 refs., 10 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
