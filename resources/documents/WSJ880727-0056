Widespread selling by speculators, trade companies, computer funds and locals who trade for their own account overwhelmed meager buying and drove prices down through successive support levels, analysts said. Estimated sugar futures volume on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange was a record 59,180 contracts, up from the prior record 57,292 contracts traded last Thursday.    The selling was largely technical in nature, according to analysts, who said there was widespread disappointment among traders Monday, when sugar futures rose only 0.31 cent a pound in reaction to Friday's announcement that the U.S. increased its sugar import quota for this year by 300,000 tons.    The trading in sugar, technically driven and dominated by sellers, was a striking reflection of yesterday's commodity markets in general. Nearly every contract fell in price, led by continued declines in grains and soybeans.    Sugar and silver markets in recent weeks benefited from the recent boom in grain and soybean markets triggered by the Midwest drought, as traders also bought contracts in these other commodities with their grain and soybean profits, analysts noted. Yesterday, though, many were selling contracts to get money to meet margin calls in grains and soybeans, they said.    As a result, the October sugar futures delivery settled at 12.06 cents a pound, for a loss of 2.41 cents, after trading as low as 11.80 cents, for a decline of 2.67 cents. This was the largest one-day drop since the March contract fell 3.81 cents Feb. 19, 1980, said Seymour Geylin, statistician for the Commodity Research Bureau Inc., a subsidiary of Knight-Ridder Inc.    Other trading months fell their daily limit of 1/2 cent a pound, which was restored yesterday by the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange. Last Thursday, the exchange raised the limit to one cent a pound for months other than October and March.    Despite yesterday's drop, according to Judy Ganes, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York, bullish fundamentals for sugar remain unchanged. &quot;Demand for sugar is increasing both domestically and world-wide,&quot; Ms. Ganes said. &quot;Sugar stocks in exporting countries have dropped to a point that unexpected increases in demand may not be met.&quot;    She noted that there were reports that China had bought 250,000 tons of refined sugar, in addition to 100,000 tons it was credited with having taken recently. Iran is still trying to arrange an oil-for-sugar swap involving as much as 500,000 tons of sugar, she said, and several Middle Eastern countries are expected to come into the market to buy sugar. World sugar reserves have dropped to just under 32% of consumption at the current rate of usage, down from 40.9% in 1985. A level of 30% is regarded as an equilibrium point.    &quot;On top of that there has been the increase in the U.S. quota and possibly there will be more increases after the damage to the Red River Valley area becomes known, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture releases its report on Aug. 11,&quot; Ms. Ganes said. This will draw more supplies from the already tight world market, she said.    Thomas Oxnard, a broker for PaineWebber Inc., Clifton, N.J., observed that &quot;the market had been extremely overbought over the past six to seven weeks. The drop was a delayed reaction and when that happens the reaction can be severe.&quot;    Yet Ms. Ganes wasn't flustered by sugar's drubbing yesterday. &quot;Remember that in 1974, prices rose sharply and then suffered a big drop before recovering and shooting up to an all-time high of 66 cents,&quot; she said.    In other futures markets yesterday:   COFFEE: Futures prices dropped sharply as traders ignored fundamentals and joined the general selling spree in commodities. The September delivery contract fell 4.84 cents to $1.3295 a pound. At one point it traded as low as $1.3150 for a loss of more than 6 1/4 cents. An impending cut in world export quotas from producing nations today had no effect on the market, a coffee dealer said. The 15-day average of the International Coffee Organization's indicator price yesterday was at $1.1453 a pound. Because it was below $1.15 it was expected to trigger a reduction of 1.5 million bags of coffee from world export quotas, reducing them to 51.5 million bags. A bag weighs 132 pounds. On Oct. 1, 1987, when the current ICO coffee year began, export quotas amounted to 58 million bags. The reduction of 6.5 million bags since then has been caused by declining prices. Brazil is currently in its frost-prone period, but the weather has remained mild, which has contributed to pressure on prices, the dealer said.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed with gold contracts rising while silver and platinum fell. August delivery gold advanced $5.10 an ounce to $431.70, while silver for September delivery was off 16 cents an ounce to $6.94. Platinum for October delivery declined $9.80 an ounce to $532.60. The withdrawal of inflation-hedge buying in most commodity markets was a major factor depressing prices, said Richard Hirsch, vice president and metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., New York. The selling indicated that the prospect of accelerating inflation, a growing concern in recent months, has diminished, he said. Gold ended higher primarily because of a technical bounce from Monday's oversell, he added. &quot;There were a lot of new short sellers on Monday. Today, they took profits and the gold price rose,&quot; Mr. Hirsch said. &quot;Gold didn't rally as much as silver and platinum did recently and shouldn't have fallen as much on Monday,&quot; he said.    INTEREST RATES: Despite the inflation-flattening plunge in many commodities yesterday, Treasury bond futures prices closed slightly lower in relatively light trading. Concern about this morning's release of real gross national product figures for the second quarter, and a large number of traders who have sold bond futures short, betting on lower prices ahead, weighed heavily on the market, said Gerald Walsh, a futures analyst with Refco Group Ltd. in New York. Also depressing prices was yesterday's report of a larger-than-expected 8.8% increase in durable goods orders in June. Treasury bond futures for September delivery had been 3/8 lower in early trading before rebounding to close at 86 9/16, down 1/16. Mr. Walsh maintained that a relatively strong second-quarter economy is largely factored into bond futures prices, and that a &quot;massive short-covering rally&quot; could be triggered by GNP figures significantly below market predictions. Many analysts are predicting that the growth in second-quarter GNP was 4% or more, compared with a 3.6% GNP growth rate in the first quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
