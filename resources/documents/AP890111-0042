The high-profile prosecutor who also targeted corrupt politicianssaid one of the proudest achievements of his 5{-year tenure had beenan improvement in the ``ethical climate in business and politics.   ``When I spoke of crime five or six years ago, most peoplethought of street crime and violent crime,'' he said. ``We have nowbroadened those areas to business and politics.''   Giuliani announced his resignation as U.S. Attorney for Manhattanat a packed news conference Tuesday. He said he will leave the postby the end of January.   By overseeing the conviction of the heads of five New York crimefamilies, the insider trading plea of financier Ivan Boesky andproposed securities fraud plea of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., andthe Wedtech conviction of former Rep. Mario Biaggi, Giuliani becamethe town's most talked-about prosecutor since Thomas Dewey rose toprominence by busting racketeers in the 1930s.   It has been widely speculated that Giuliani, a Republican,intends to run for mayor of New York later this year, and he said hehad not ``shut the door'' on such a bid.   ``We'll figure that out in the next few weeks,'' he said, addingthat he also could return to private practice with his topassistant, Dennison Young Jr., who also resigned.   Edward Lurie, executive director of the state RepublicanCommittee, said Giuliani and state GOP Chairman Anthony Colavitawould be meeting soon to ``discuss Giuliani's interests.''   Democratic Mayor Edward I. Koch, who is expected to run for afourth term, praised Giuliani as a ``superb prosecutor,'' wished himwell in his future endeavors ``in the private sector,'' andacknowledged that Giuliani would be a ``formidable candidate''should he decide to run for mayor.   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also praised Giuliani.   ``He can be extremely proud of the record of his 5{ years as thechief federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York,particularly in the areas of organized crime and officialcorruption,'' Thornburgh said.   Thornburgh also announced the appointment of Benito Romano, whohas been an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, as Guiliani'sinterim replacement.   Giuliani said his resignation should not come as a surprisebecause he had said last February that he did not plan staying inthe job under the next presidential administration.   Giuliani, who served as associate attorney general in the JusticeDepartment before becoming U.S. attorney here in 1983, used thefederal racketeering statutes to convict the heads of New York'sfive crime families. His office also broke open a huge heroindistribution operation in the ``Pizza Connection'' case.   He also pressed insider trading cases. His first target, DennisLevine, former managing director at the investment banking firm ofDrexel Burnham Lambert, pleaded guilty to securities fraud and othercharges. That led to a guilty plea by Boesky and last month'sagreement by Drexel to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay arecord $650 million in fines and restitution.   In addition, Giuliani's office conducted extensive investigationsof corruption among New York City officials. He personallyprosecuted Stanley Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader who wasconvicted of corruption charges.   Prosecution of the Wedtech scandal involving payoffs by thedefense contractor to public officials to obtain federal contractsresulted in the conviction of Biaggi, D-N.Y., among others.   Giuliani's office also indicted former Philippines PresidentFerdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, on racketeering charges forallegedly plundering their homeland of hundreds of millions ofdollars.   Most recently, the U.S. attorney's office lost a highlypublicized case _ the trial of former Miss America Bess Myerson, herlover Carl Capasso and former Judge Hortense Gabel on charges theyconspired to reduce the alimony Capasso owed to his former wife.   Romano, 39, for the past 18 months has been a partner in the lawfirm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer andamp; Wood, where he has beeninvolved in civil litigation and white-collar criminal defense work.   Appointed to the U.S. attorney's office in 1980, he rose toassociate U.S. attorney, the office's third-ranking post, beforeleaving in 1987.   Romano said he was not seeking to keep the U.S. attorney positionpermanently.</TEXT></DOC>
