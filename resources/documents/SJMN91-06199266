So he caught a ride on the gas tank of a Honda motorcycle, and waswhisked between idling cars to the wrestling pavilion, in time to earn aWestern Region championship in the 90-pound category for 9- to 10-year-olds.;   &quot;I was thinking about wrestling the whole time,&quot; he said. &quot;No, no troublefocusing at all.&quot;;    His father, Roger Mahugh, overcame traffic, too, and sawShawn win.;    &quot;(Shawn) was ecstatic -- and of course, so was his father,&quot;Roger MaHugh said. &quot;What an adventure.&quot;;    The voyage was rough. Roger Mahughsaid after watching the air show, he began to worry that too many cars on toolittle road meant his son might forfeit his chance for a title.;    He talkedto a nearby cop.;    &quot;I asked them if they could clear a path or a least radiothe pavilion to let them know we would be late,&quot; he said.;    The officer wasuncooperative.;    So the only way around the traffic was running. Coach RudyLopez and Shawn began jogging to the pavilion, four miles away.;    Along camea motorcycle with two riders. Roger Mahugh waved them down and asked them togive his son a ride. They agreed and sped ahead to find the running wrestler.;   &quot;I stepped back and realized I had given my son to two motorcyclists,&quot;Mahugh said. &quot;They weren't the Hells Angels, but they certainly weren'tclean-cut. Hey, the meet was starting. We had to get him there.&quot;;    The twocaught up with Shawn, calling his name.;    &quot;They said they talked with Roger.It was five of 4 (p.m.), and we had to get there by 4. So he went,&quot; saidLopez, who flagged a ride in the back of a pickup.;    Shawn made it in plentyof time. He pinned his opponent, fellow Californian Jan Knight, in 2:06, forhis third consecutive pin of the meet.;    Shawn was undefeated in his fivetournament matches, winning the first two 5-4, 14-1, and then moving on withthree first-round pins.;    He trains in Los Gatos with a club known as theWildcats, which sent four wrestlers to Idaho. Last year at the Boise meet,Shawn was eliminated after two matches.;    He said one more year ofexperience helped. His club competes in the Santa Clara Valley WrestlingAssociation, and he compiled a 35-2 record in matches leading up to thetournament.;    Leroy Evans, the state youth wrestling chairman, said the meetof 1,700 wrestlers, under the auspices of USA Wrestling, is the nation'sbiggest. There are six regional meets, but no national championships forwrestlers Shawn's age. He said they shy away from wider meets because oftravel expense and the importance of not getting carried away with youthcompetition.;    The pavilion at Boise State seats more than 12,000. &quot;Lastyear was kind of intimidating,&quot; Roger Mahugh said. &quot;He had never wrestled infront of such a big crowd.&quot;;    Lopez said Shawn is an unconventional wrestlerin some ways; he relies on power most.;    &quot;He's a smart wrestler, strong legsand big upper body. He's not fast or balanced, the kind of things you look forin a wrestler. If you put him on a balance beam, he'd have trouble staying on.But you could say he overpowers people.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANDREW AYRES, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910717  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  642  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 17, 199100199266,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
