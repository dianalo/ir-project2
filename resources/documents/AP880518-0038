The only incident was a 15-minute halt in the countdown causedby a storm cloud passing by six minutes before scheduled liftoff.   The launch took place at 8:58 p.m. Tuesday (7:58 p.m. EDT).Sixteen minutes and 40 seconds later, the 4,374-pound satelliteseparated perfectly. Officials at the European space center inKourou, on the north coast of South America, called the flight ``acomplete success.''   It was the second successful operation this year. Six morelaunches are planned in 1988 and nine each in 1989 and 1990.   Three of Ariane's four launch failures were caused by problemswith the rocket's third stage. The last failure, in 1986, haltedthe program for nearly a year.   ``The 22nd Ariane shot is a new success for the Europeanlauncher,'' said President Francois Mitterrand of France in amessage to Frederic Allest, president of Arianespace, thecommercial arm of the space agency.   ``It is particularly important for the renown of the French andEuropean space industries at a moment when they are engaged in avery tight world competition.''   The Intelsat V-F13 satellite, which was put into a fixed orbit22,500 miles above Earth, is part of a series of 15 satellitesbuilt by an international consortium led by Ford Aerospace. Itcontains 15,000 telephone circuits and two television channels.   ``The four Ariane shots, after an interruption in launches ofnearly a year, proves the viability of the launcher and puts Europein a very good world position, because Arianespace holds 56 percentof the world orders for satellites,'' said Premier Michel Rocard ofFrance.   The Europeans now have 44 launches on their order booksrepresenting $2.6 billion. Ariane launches cost between $53 millionand $105 million, depending on the version.   The next launch, scheduled for June 8, will be the first of thenew Ariane 4 series, a much larger vehicle capable of carrying 4.2tons into orbit, nearly double the capacity of Tuesday's Ariane 2.   Ariane 4, with greater fuel capacity and more powerful motors,is scheduled to be the commercial workhorse of the European spaceeffort for the next decade.   The International Telecommunications Organization plans to sendup one more Intelsat V satellite. Then it too will move into biggerequipment. The Intelsat VI satellites will contain 40,000 telephonecircuits.   Commercial satellite launching is also offered by the UnitedStates, the Soviet Union and China.   The U.S. program still is struggling to get back intocompetition, however, because of the major setback suffered whenthe space shuttle Challenger blew up on Jan. 28, 1986, and otherfailures. Seven astronauts died in the disaster.</TEXT></DOC>
