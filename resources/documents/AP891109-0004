Shesuffered slight injuries.   In Pineview, Ga., three houses and at least two mobile homeswere damaged when the tornado hit about 5:45 p.m., Wilcox DeputySheriff Stacy Johnson said.   One of the mobile homes, the home of the 3-year-old, wasdemolished, Johnson said. Five other people were injured, includingthe child's father, Billy West.   West suffered an apparent broken neck and was undergoing testsat the Medical Center of Central Georgia in Macon. Johnson did notknow the child's name.   In Louisiana, New Orleans-area residents cleaned up floodedhomes as rain kept falling in the southeastern part of the state.   The National Weather Service said the latest storm was notexpected to cause floods like Tuesday's, when hundreds of homeswere swamped and a 2-year-old boy drowned after being swept into adrainage canal in Jefferson Parish.   Wednesday's rain knocked out power to about 600 New Orleanshomes and businesses, far fewer than the 11,000 affected theprevious day, said Bill Tregre of Entergy Corp.   In Alabama, the morning twisters caused damage only in GenevaCounty and a mile-long stretch Dothan in the state's southeastcorner, but streets were flooded from Mobile in the west and muchof southern Alabama, officials said. No other injuries werereported.   Two or three tornadoes destroyed three homes and a restaurant,damaged six businesses and did minor damage to about 40 homes inthe Dothan area, Dothan-Houston County Emergency Management Agencyofficials said. The restaurant's roof and walls blew across thestreet into a tire store's parking lot, damaging dozens of cars.   ``We've found some roofs that were taken seven blocks away anddropped,'' said emergency agency Assistant Director Pat Bradley.   At Wallace College in Dothan, about 2,000 panicky students wereordered to remain inside a building for more than an hour as floodwaters inundated the campus because tornado warnings were ineffect, said school spokeswoman Barbara Alford.   ``We had some cars floating in the parking lot,'' said AnnePowell, secretary to the president at the school. Classes werecalled off for the day.   Houston County public schools were also closed.   In Geneva County about 40 miles southwest of Dothan, a tornadotossed Mrs. E.C. Barnes' mobile home into a pond with her inside,said a Samson police dispatcher who refused to give his name.   ``They had to go out in a boat to get her,'' the dispatchersaid. Mrs. Barnes, 54, suffered cuts and was hospitalized forobservation, he said.   In Malvern about 10 miles southwest of Dothan, thunderstormwinds damaged a house trailer and peanut wagons.   Nearly 10 inches of rain fell in Florala, 7 inches in Dothan and5.6 inches in Mobile by mid-afternoon, the weather service said.   The New Orleans area received up to 1.75 inches of rain by noon,far less than Tuesday. Between 6 p.m. Monday and 3 p.m. Tuesday, adeluge of 12.5 inches fell at New Orleans International Airport inKenner, the weather service said.   By Wednesday, flood waters had receded nearly everywhere, exceptfor a 1,000-house subdivision in Destrehan nearly 15 miles west ofNew Orleans.   Officials did not know how many buildings in New Orleans and thesurrounding St. Charles, Jefferson, and St. Bernard parishes wereflooded or how much damage was done.   ``It happened so quick and it caught everybody off-guard. Wehaven't calculated any hard figures,'' said Capt. Sam Zinna of theSt. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office.   Public and Catholic schools were closed Wednesday in Jeffersonand St. Charles parishes. Public schools were open in New Orleansand St. Bernard Parish, but Catholic schools were closed.   Some residents were able to get back to their homes and startcleaning up.   ``I'm still here mopping up water,'' said Alberta Lewis ofKenner, who said she had about 2 feet of water in the house Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
