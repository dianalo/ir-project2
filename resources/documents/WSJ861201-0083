That's the choice Leon Emmons is giving Iowa students this fall. As owner of Mr. Executive Hair Replacement Center in Des Moines, Mr. Emmons will provide a free hairpiece to any Iowa trade-school or college student who agrees to stay in the state at least two years after graduation. The offer, he explains, is his way of trying to stop young Iowans from fleeing this economically depressed farm state.    &quot;We don't have the jobs or the nice beaches that young people like,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe a full head of hair will keep them in Iowa.&quot;    Already, Mr. Emmons notes, two students have accepted the offer and a half dozen others are considering it. One student, Darren Wilson, drove three hours to Des Moines from his home in Burlington to get his receding hairline camouflaged. &quot;I'm not completely bald, but just enough to bug me,&quot; says the 23-year-old sophomore at Southeastern Community College. &quot;If looking good means having to stay in Iowa, I guess that's OK.&quot;    The offer does have one snag, however: While the hairpiece itself is free, students must agree to pay $25 a month for two years to have it styled. That's Mr. Emmons's insurance that any takers will live up to their end of the bargain, although he points out that the verbal agreements aren't exactly enforceable. &quot;Obviously, it's hard to repossess somebody's hair,&quot; he says.    Still, many students bristle at Mr. Emmons's proposal. &quot;Throw me money, I'll stay in Iowa,&quot; says Carlos Trevino, a junior at the University of Iowa who admits to suffering from the early stages of balding. &quot;But throw me hair and I won't. I'd rather go to England and try one of those remedies where cows lick your head.&quot;    The offer has also failed to amuse some business leaders, many of whom feel that Iowa is facing a serious brain drain because so many college graduates are taking jobs out of state. &quot;In terms of keeping young people in town, I hope we can offer something more substantial than hair replacements,&quot; says Andrew Mooney, president of the Greater Des Moines Chamber of Commerce Federation.    But even Mr. Trevino concedes that Mr. Emmons's effort may be of some value. &quot;If people here can't have a good crop of corn,&quot; he says, &quot;at least they can have a good crop of hair.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
