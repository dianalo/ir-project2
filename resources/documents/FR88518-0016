On February20, 1985, EPA advised the Governor of Kansas that, based upon air quality,the ozone SIP for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area (KCMA) was substantiallyinadequate to attain the NAAQS.On July 2, 1986, the state submitted a revised ozone SIP for Johnson andWyandotte Counties, Kansas. On January 6, 1988, the state submitted revisedregulations for the control of volatile organic compound emissions in theKCMA. Today's action takes final action to approve these revisions which,together, constitute a complete Kansas ozone SIP for the KCMA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> This action is effective June 17, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> The state submittal and EPA's technical support documentare available for inspection during normal business hours at the followinglocations: Environmental Protection Agency, Region VII, 726 Minnesota Avenue,Kansas City, Kansas 66101; Kansas Department of Health and Environment,Bureau of Air Quality and Radiation Control, Forbes Field, Topeka, Kansas66620; and Environmental Protection Agency, Public Information ReferenceUnit, Room 2922, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Larry A. Hacker, (913) 236-2893or FTS 757-2893.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2>On October 2, 1987, in two separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices, EPA proposed approval of revisions tothe Kansas ozone SIP for the KCMA. The first notice (52 FR 36963) proposedapproval of draft revisions to the state's regulations for the controlof volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. The second notice (52 FR36965) proposed approval of all remaining elements of the revised plan.No public comments were received on either of these proposed rulemakings.For a detailed discussion of the VOC regulations and the overall plan requirements,the reader is referred to the above referenced <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices.After proper notice, the state held its public hearing for the VOC regulationson November 13, 1987. Subsequent to the hearing, minor clarifications weremade to the compliance and recordkeeping provisions of Rule 28-19-74, Woolfiberglass manufacturing. The changes were nonsubstantive in that the degreeof emission control, compliance determination method, and source applicabilityrequirements were not changed. None of the remaining regulations were changedfrom their proposed versions.On January 6, 1988, the Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health andEnvironment (KDHE) submitted both temporary and permanent versions of thefinal regulations. Both sets of regulations were approved by the KansasAttorney General and the temporary versions became effective on December16, 1987. As provided by state statute, the temporary regulations remainin effect through April 30, 1988; the permanent regulations become effectiveon May 1, 1988, unless modified by the state's legislature before thatdate. If any substantive changes occur in the permanent regulations priorto their effective date, EPA will initiate rulemaking action to withdrawthis approval action. The temporary and permanent regulation packages areidentical in content; therefore, only the permanent versions have beenincluded with the state submittal materials.In numerous instances, the revised Kansas regulations provide for departmentaldiscretion to approve compliance plans and test methods which are alternativesto the EPA reference methods. EPA is approving these regulations with theunderstanding that all such alternative compliance plans and test methodsmust be submitted to EPA, and approved, as individual SIP revisions. Inthe absence of such approval, the enforceable requirements of the SIP wouldbe the emission limits or reduction requirements stated in the regulations.Also, the Kansas regulations contain provisions whereby testing is requiredwhen the facility intends to demonstrate compliance by improved operationsor new emission controls, yet no test procedures are specified. Examplesof such provisions are transfer efficiency (TE) and vapor processing systems.Test methods which are developed by the state must be approved by EPA beforefacilities may demonstrate compliance through alternative controls and/orTE.On November 24, 1987, at 52 FR 45044, EPA proposed a policy for approvalof post-1987 ozone plans for areas which would not attain the ambient standardby December 31, 1987. In that notice the Kansas City area appeared on alist of potential 1988 SIP call areas because preliminary air quality datafor the period 1984-1986 indicated the area may still be exceeding theozone standard. The NAAQS for ozone is attained when the number of expectedexceedances is less than or equal to one per year when averaged over thethree most recent years of record (see 40 CFR 50.9). EPA has now completedits review of the air quality data from January 1, 1985, through December31, 1987, and the data show that the area is attaining the ozone standard.Consequently, EPA does not intend to issue a SIP call for this area in1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">EPA Action</ITAG>In today's notice, EPA takes final action to approve the July 2, 1986,submittal of revisions to the Kansas ozone SIP for the KCMA. Also, EPAtakes final action to approve the January 6, 1988, submittal of revisedVOC regulations. These two submittals, together, constitute a completeozone plan for the Kansas portion of the KCMA.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by July 18, 1988. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements.
