Also, the importance of complex energy is increasing. As a result,limited demand entails more violent competition among various energyindustries (electricity, gas, oil, etc.). Such trend is calling for anew system that flexibly meets the needs of the present society. Household-purposecity gas accounts for more than 90% of all the city gas. One of the meansto increase city gas demand is to encourage people to use gas-type roomheating/cooling systems to enrich citizen life and ease difficultiesduring the power-consumption peak period. Anothe important factor isto develop a system, such as a cogeneration system, that flexibly appliesto heat and electricity balance. Pipeline construction and maintenancecosts account for most of the gas-related costs. One of the attemptsto reduce such costs is the development of a small-section or non-diggingpipe-laying technique and a diagnostic robot. Large computers are alreadyin use in total information management. To ensure security, people concernedhave made much progress in upgrading the performance of and spreadingsensors for carbon monoxide and other gases. To eliminate all accidents,they have also developed an automatic cut-off method in case of an abnormalefflux. This method is expected to spread in the future. They have alsodeveloped an LNG cold heat utilization technique and a by-product carbonfiber. (2 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
