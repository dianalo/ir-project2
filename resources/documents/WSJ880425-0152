Even though steel has lost its competitiveness and autos are still struggling, the U.S. is still the largest exporter of manufactured goods. If you add up all exports world-wide, the U.S. continues to capture 18%, compared with 13% for West Germany and 12% for Japan.    But that is not the way companies keep score. There is no business Olympics. American multinationals don't operate like home-country amateurs for the sake of balancing trade statistics. They are world-class because they operate world-wide. Because of them, the U.S. share of manufactured goods exported from other countries is increasing. It was 13% in 1977, 14% in 1983, and 15% in 1985. When American companies move abroad, they not only attack local markets but become big exporters -- often to the U.S. Almost 20% of U.S. imports come from American affiliates overseas.    Critics of American companies point to their production abroad and talk about lost jobs. It's true that 8.3 million people are employed overseas by American multinationals. But there is no evidence of the &quot;hollowing&quot; of America in the manufacturing sector. America's share of all manufacturing jobs in the U.S., Japan, Europe and the newly industrializing countries was 27% in 1960. It reached 30% in 1980, and was still at 30% in 1986. Meanwhile, Europe's share of these jobs declined from 51% in 1960 to 32% in 1986. Europe, not America, is being hollowed out by the NICs and Japan.    America looks like it is being hollowed out only when you compare its manufacturing sector with its even more dynamic service sector. Between 1960 and 1986, jobs in manufacturing declined to 24% of all jobs from 34%, while jobs in the service sector increased to 73% from 56%.    That's the good news. The bad news is that not many of those 8.3 million jobs will move to the U.S. as a result of the weakened dollar. Politicians, of course, want them to. Many U.S. multinationals do not. They moved abroad for several good reasons: to get close to markets they sell in, to get good ideas from their foreign customers, to avoid protectionism, and to get products and components that were better or cheaper. They were not forced to go abroad simply because the dollar was overvalued. That was a factor only recently. American companies have been gradually increasing their presence abroad for decades.    In the early 1960s McKinsey analyzed the overseas role and investments of 100 major U.S. industrial corporations. Between 1950 and 1960 their foreign sales increased to 17% from 10% of total business. Four out of five companies doubled their overseas sales; 75% more than doubled their foreign assets. While the exports of half of these companies more than doubled from 1950 to 1960, their total overseas production increased substantially more than their exports. In 1950, the median company in this group produced almost two-thirds of its overseas sales volume in the U.S. By 1960 that figure dropped to 30%. McKinsey's 1983 study of mid-size growth companies shows this same push to move production close to markets. Since the 1950s, jobs have been created by overseas markets as much as they have been &quot;lost&quot; to them.    Since the 1950s U.S. companies have defined a five-stage evolution of expansion abroad. Japanese companies are now imitating that evolution.    In the first stage, the typical U.S. company kept everything here and used foreign distribution. In stage two it established its own sales company abroad. Stage three saw local production plus sales and service in key countries. In the fourth stage, which is where many U.S. multinationals are now, the company established full-fledged, autonomous businesses with all major functions.    A few of the most successful and advanced U.S. multinationals are in a fifth stage in which they have world-wide personnel, Randamp;D, and financing strategies. They move managers around the world for experience and acculturation. They dedicate factories to parts or products according to world-wide production plans, not local sales. They are truly international, not &quot;multilocal,&quot; organizations.    There is something else stage-four and stage-five companies do that may foil predictions about the cheap dollar bringing production back to the U.S. As exchange rates have become increasingly volatile, these companies have learned how to diffuse currency risk.    Top-tier Japanese corporations have neutralized the impact of currency fluctuations by matching revenues and costs in major currencies, producing in NICs (which have &quot;in-between&quot; currencies), importing as much as they export, excelling in financial engineering (&quot;Zaitech&quot;) and currency trading, differentiating/changing models frequently to raise prices, and pressuring suppliers to share currency gains. As a result, they have survived the huge change in the dollar/yen relationship over the past two years.    Well-run American and European companies have advanced beyond these tactics. They make decisions about ownership and finance not only to hedge their currency exposure but to take advantage of significant differences in tax rates and treatment of income. They also take advantage of new opportunities to control rather than own assets.    Developments in financial markets have given them more options than they had a decade ago. When they make plans they try to use these options to balance the value of flexibility against other factors such as protectionism, likely local inflation rates, shifts in the value of local currency, presence of leading-edge customers, quality and education of the workforce, and importance of scale. Despite the dollar's big slide, they are not going to drop their plans and move production back to the U.S. overnight.    Companies have tried to make their production more mobile, often by using suppliers world-wide as well as by building plants with low &quot;break-evens.&quot; It is likely that both American and non-American firms will consider producing more in the U.S., particularly if labor relations continue to improve. The advantages of being inside the U.S. market are considerable.    But many executives are skeptical. Foreign companies have slowed down their investment in the U.S. for fear that the dollar will drop even more, diminishing the relative value of any new assets here. Only older investments are kept in dollars in order not to realize the loss. Senior managers worry that the weaker dollar will ignite inflation in the U.S. when oil prices go up, imported goods are replaced by domestic production, and the interest on U.S. government securities is raised to attract foreign capital.    Chasing cheap currencies is about as bad an international business strategy as chasing cheap labor. Leapfrogging from country to country isn't very profitable in the end. Paradoxically, the U.S. will need a stronger and more stable dollar before its companies reverse their long-term trend of moving production overseas.    ---   Mr. Ohmae is managing director of McKinsey andamp; Co. in Japan. </TEXT></DOC>
