(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Navy enlisted man tried to sellsubmarine warfare secrets to the Soviets because he had beendischarged for indecent exposure, according to authorities who saidno damaging information was passed along.   Craig D. Kunkle, 39, was arrested Tuesday at a Williamsburg motelas he tried to turn over classified documents to two undercover FBIagents posing as Soviet officials, said Irvin B. Wells III, head ofthe FBI's Norfolk office.   Kunkle, a former chief petty officer, was charged with attemptingto deliver classified information to a foreign government. Ifconvicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.   Kunkle, of Virginia Beach, was discharged from the Navy in 1985as non-judicial punishment for acts of indecent exposure committedat the Barber's Point Naval Air Station in Hawaii, according to anFBI affidavit.   A Navy spokesman in Washington said it was against policy todescribe the circumstances of the discharge. Kunkle had an``excellent record'' during his service, Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigleysaid.   Beginning early last month, Kunkle talked six times with an FBIundercover agent whom he believed to be a representative of theSoviet embassy in Washington, the affidavit said.   ``During each of these conversations, Kunkle discussed variousaspects of his military background and experience, and his desire tosell classified United States Navy military secrets to the SovietUnion for monetary gain, and as revenge for his discharge from theUnited States Navy,'' the affidavit said.   It did not specify how much money Kunkle is alleged to haveexpected for the documents.   The court papers said Kunkle was a specialist who installedsubmarine monitoring equipment on Navy aircraft. He served in theNorth Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific oceans and gainedsecurity clearance in 1984, when he was designated an anti-submarinewarfare supervisor.   He was working alone in his attempts to sell the information tothe Soviets, said Wells.   Kunkle's wife, Suzanne A. Kunkle, is enlisted in the Navy. ``Weare interviewing her, but there's no indication of any involvementon her behalf,'' Wells said.   Kunkle was first identified by counterintelligence surveillanceof telephone calls to the Soviet embassy in Washington, said asource who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. counterintelligenceagencies routinely monitor telephone calls to the embassy in aneffort to prevent spying.   The case is unrelated to the Norfolk-area spy ring led by formerNavy sailor John Walker, who is serving a life sentence for sellingvaluable Navy secrets to the Soviets, FBI spokesman Charles W.Steinmetz said.   The affidavit said that on Dec. 9 Kunkle mailed a packet ofdocuments, photographs, diagrams and related information to theundercover FBI agent at an Alexandria post office box.   Kunkle told the agent his intention ``was to demonstrate the typeof classified information he was capable of providing to the SovietUnion then, and in future contacts,'' the affidavit said.   The Navy determined on Dec. 14 that the information wasclassified as secret and could harm national security if released tothe Soviet Union, the court papers said.   ``We've prevented the Soviet Union from receiving this highlysensitive information,'' Wells said.   At a court appearance, Kunkle said he made about $260 a week as asecurity guard at Portsmouth General Hospital and worked as apart-time investigator for CCP Pinkerton Investigative Services.   Dick Rafferty, assistant administrator at Portsmouth General,said Kunkle has worked for the hospital for three months and wasplaced on unpaid leave pending the outcome of the case.   Kunkle worked for Pinkerton for five to six months last year,said Paul Santana, Pinkerton's southeast Virginia district manager.He said Kunkle was a security supervisor who traveled from client toclient, making sure that Pinkerton uniformed security guards weredoing their jobs properly. He said Kunkle had a good record with thecompany.   U.S. Magistrate Tommy E. Miller ordered Kunkle jailed pending apreliminary hearing Thursday and granted his request for acourt-appointed attorney.   Verlon Newman, a friend of Kunkle, said he felt angry andbetrayed by the arrest. He described Kunkle as a ``typicalall-American looking guy.''</TEXT></DOC>
