SCEcorp last month proposed a $2.3 billion takeover of San Diego Gas that would create the nation's biggest investor-owned utility.    SCEcorp said the proposed rate reduction would reflect &quot;the increased efficiency brought about by the merger.&quot; It added that the decrease would be separate from whatever rate increases or decreases San Diego Gas makes independently because of changes in fuel and purchased power costs.    Howard P. Allen, SCEcorp's chairman and chief executive officer, also stressed that the combined companies will &quot;work hard to achieve any force reductions through a combination of normal attrition and early retirements of employees of both companies.&quot;    A San Diego Gas spokesman declined comment. </TEXT></DOC>
