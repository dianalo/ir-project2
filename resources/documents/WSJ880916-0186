Carroll about their mother (&quot;Child-Care Executive, 58, Retires,&quot; Aug. 25).    I believe that the job of being a mother is probably the most difficult and yet the most important job in the world. Unfortunately, those women who give themselves to being full-time mothers often do not receive the recognition and honor they deserve. This article was a refreshing exception to that unfortunate reality. Thank you for publishing it.    Larry K. Bolden   Dothan, Ala.</TEXT></DOC>
