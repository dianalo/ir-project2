Meanwhile, another wildlife official warned people not to takevigilante action against the usually harmless animals after a reportthat a woman living near the site where the girl was killed attackeda small alligator.   Lt. Dick Lawrence of the Florida Game and Fresh Water FishCommission said he's stopped trying to explain to people complainingabout alligators that attacks by the animals are extremely rare.   ``Extremely rare doesn't mean a damn thing with what happenedthis weekend,'' said Lawrence, alligator coordinator for the gamecommission in a 10-county Everglades region.   Lawrence, who issues permits to have state-designated trapperskill troublesome alligators, said his office received 80 complaintsabout alligators Monday, four or five times the normal number,following the death Saturday of young Erin Glover in Englewood.   The child was splashing through shallow water along the shore ofa lake near her home when a 10{-foot alligator grabbed her. Her31-pound body was recovered more than five hours later after gameofficers shot and killed the alligator.   ``When people see an alligator, especially now, all they see isthe mouthful of teeth and ugliness,'' Lawrence said.   ``I think there'll be more permits issued, but the kills may notgo up. The trapper may go out there in a day or two, and the gator'snot there.''   Game officials received a report Monday that a woman living nearthe site of the fatal attack ``bashed a 3-foot gator's head in,''said game commission Lt. Jim Farrior. Officials could not confirmthe report.   Farrior said alligators that small eat only minnows, frogs andsnakes, and he cautioned people against taking violent actionagainst gators.   ``I think the vigilante response is not a good response. It'sineffective,'' he said. ``You can't go out on a rampage and startkilling every gator out there.''   Wildlife officials will not change their policy for handlingnuisance alligators, Farrior said. They will kill alligators morethan 4 feet long if they are aggressive toward people, pets orlivestock or show a lack of fear toward humans.   Lawrence said people who live near ponds, canals and lakes neednot panic if they spot an alligator.   Including Erin's death, alligators have killed six people andengaged in 95 unprovoked attacks in Florida since 1948, according togame commission statistics.   ``Generally, if you leave alligators alone, they'll leave youalone,'' he said.   Franklin Percival, wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service in Gainesville, said people probably wereoverreacting to Erin's death, but he added that it's important torespect alligators.   ``You're just really asking for it when you're dealing with awild animal at close range. You have to keep your distance,'' hesaid.   Alligators have been a protected species in Florida since themid-1960s, when their population dwindled after years of vigoroushunting.   But in recent years their population has rebounded dramatically,with state wildlife experts estimating there are 1 millionalligators on 6.7 million acres. On Sept. 1, for the first timesince 1962, the state will hold a one-month gator hunt in which upto 3,000 will be taken.</TEXT></DOC>
