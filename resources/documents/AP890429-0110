At least 20 people died in the unrest earlier this month inTbilisi, the Georgian capital. Georgians say the troops attacked apeaceful demonstration with shovels, clubs and harmful gases.   Gen. I.N. Rodionov, commander of the Caucasus military district,said Tbilisi residents are blaming Red Army soldiers for the clash,and he strongly implied that troops of the Interior Ministry wereto blame.   Rodionov, speaking on the evening news show Vremya, said wivesand children of Red Army soldiers have been beaten and theirapartments stoned in retaliation for the crackdown. He gave noother details.   He said Interior Ministry troops should have handled thedemonstration without the aid of Red Army soldiers and suggestedthat ministry troops wear special uniforms so they can bedistinguished from the Red Army.   He said the ministry troops also used the harmful gas thatdissidents claimed was nerve gas.   The Georgian health minister said last week that troops used anunidentified chemical that caused at least two of the deaths andseveral serious injuries.   Rodionov, like other Soviet officials, maintained the substanceused against demonstrators was tear gas. He also said he personallyopposed the use of troops to crush the demonstrations.   Meanwhile, in other parts of the Caucasus region, plans for MayDay celebrations were canceled in Soviet Armenia for fear theycould turn into pro-independence demonstrations.   The military commander of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, issueda call for calm Saturday, asking residents not to allow themselvesto be incited into a confrontation with authorities, said RafaelPopoyan, a newsman for the official radio station in Yerevan.
