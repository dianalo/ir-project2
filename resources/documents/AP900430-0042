The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the fraud andmisrepresentation suit by 32 former employees of a GM subsidiary inClinton, Miss., should go to trial.   Those who sued had been employed at a Packard Electric plant inClinton before GM in 1983 began laying off hundreds of workersthere _ and thousands elsewhere _ in response to a slumping demandfor domestic automobiles.   The car-manufacturing giant negotiated with the employees' uniona separation agreement under which workers could opt for aseverance payment instead of having their seniority and rehirerights preserved.   Under the so-called voluntary termination of employment plan,the 32 Packard Electric employees received payments of between$10,000 and $22,000 when leaving their jobs.   Their suit alleges that at meetings to explain the severanceplan, a GM representative said they could be rehired if new jobswere created. The employees allegedly were told they would have toapply like everyone else, without any consideration of seniority,but would be eligible for rehiring.   New positions opened at the plant in 1985, but the 32ex-employees were told the severance plan they had chosen made themineligible for rehiring.   The 32 employees sued in federal court, but based their suit onMississippi law claims of fraud and misrepresentation.   Lawyers for GM sought a dismissal, arguing that the proper forumwas the National Labor Relations Board. Even if a court suit wereallowed, GM said, the state law claims would be pre-empted byfederal labor law.   A federal trial judge and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsruled against GM.   ``The NLRB has no jurisdiction and ... state law governs theaction,'' the appeals court said. It characterized the case as one``involving alleged promises made and broken in the highly chargedenvironment of large-scale layoffs and shifts in the labor market.''   GM then sought Supreme Court review.   The case is GM vs. Wells, 89-1067.</TEXT></DOC>
