<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0801 </DOCNO><TEXT>Research of the Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN) into autonomouswind diesel systems (AWDS) has resulted in two new developments whichhave been tested at experimental facilities, and which are now readyfor a commercial follow-up: design rules and criteria for an optimalincorporation of a flywheel in an AWDS, and for dimensional optimizationof the main components of a flywheel-incorporated AWDS, have been establishedand tested; the dump load with its control unit in an AWDS test rig,has been successfully replaced by a far more economical control of theelectric conversion system of the variable speed wind turbine (excitationcontrol). Also, experiments are being carried out concerning the incorporationof an accumulator (battery bank, 400 V, 50 kWh) into the DC-link of theconversion system of a variable speed wind turbine. 7 figs., 6 refs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
