Usingvarious combinations of each five types of the cylindrical furnaces andthe diffusers, the flow velocity distributions were measured with a laserDoppler anemometer under the condition with variation of Reynolds numberand swirling number. It was found that the expansion geometries had onlya minor influence on the characteristics of the internal recirculationzone when the flow was confined in a small furne space, while they becameimportant in determining a flow pattern when confined in a larger furnace.The recirculating mass flow rate (Mr/Mo) max was found to be a functionof both swirl number S and vortex diameter expansion ratio Di/Do. Theempirical formula to determine the value of the maximum recirculatingmass flow rate was obtained. (This study was performed as a series ofthe studies, which were promted by IFRF, on the aerodynamics at the near-fieldof the swirl burners.) (13 figs, 1 tab, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
