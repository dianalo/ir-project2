Thecity's bankers, however, were less enthusiastic.   They showed little interest in financing Mr. Madden's newoffice building, the first to rise above the city's pockedskyline in a decade. Detroit's bankers insisted that Mr.Madden's numbers didn't add up to financial success. Outragedcity officials accused the bankers of stodgily puttingprofits before community needs.</LP><TEXT>   Only when the aggressive Bank of Boston lent Mr. Maddenthe money did work begin, and now the building is anarchitectural jewel partly clad in pink marble and with fourhuge flags flapping on top. But unable to lure tenantswithout very generous concessions, the building also isDetroit's biggest bad loan. Bank of Boston spent last monthscrambling to foreclose on its $96 million credit. Meanwhile,the local banks stood back and, mostly in quiet, savoredtheir vindication.   &quot;The simple lesson from the Madden building is thatbankers around here want more than a dreamer's promises tomake a loan,&quot; says Ronald D. Story, president of the MichiganBankers Association. &quot;It shows there's wisdom in conservativebanking.&quot;   Nowhere is conservative banking practiced as widely as inMichigan and other Great Lakes states. Long dependent on aregional economy that rises and falls with the autoindustry's swings, banks in the region rarely stray far fromthe basics of opening checking accounts, backing smallbusinesses and managing trust funds. Economic uncertainty hasgenerally kept them from seeking quick gains through riskyloans to commercial developers, junk-bond artists or ThirdWorld nations.   Such caution, and the resulting plodding performance, usedto draw Wall Street's scorn. Not now. By stayingconservative, banks in the region once derided as the &quot;RustBelt&quot; stand as pillars of strength while institutions in theNortheast and Texas collapse and even New York giants such asCiticorp slash dividends and seek new capital.   &quot;It's like the tortoises outracing the hares,&quot; says GeorgeGregorash, an executive in the Federal Reserve Bank ofChicago's supervision and regulation office. &quot;Slow but steadybanking has proved its worth.&quot;   In fact, the banks' overall health and their ability tokeep credit flowing have helped anchor the Great Lakesstates' economies during the current economic storm despitethe auto industry's slump. &quot;One of the problems in theNortheast and Texas was that there may have been too muchlending going on when the economy weakened, and thatexacerbated the troubles,&quot; says R. Chris Moore, a vicepresident with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. &quot;Butthat has traditionally not been the case in this part of thecountry.&quot;   Since the depths of the Depression in 1934, Michigan hashad only 17 bank failures; Texas had 103 in 1990 alone. Arecent survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. foundthat banks in the Great Lakes region have a level of problemloans only half that of banks nationwide. And last year, whenmany banks took a pounding, the region had the nation'shighest percentage of banks with earnings gains and thelowest percentage of money-losers. Of the nation's top 30banks in Shearson Lehman Brothers' recent ranking of creditquality, 13 were in the industrial Midwest.   The conservatism of these banks is legendary. Thepresident of Cincinnati's Fifth Third Bancorp, the nation's72nd-largest in terms of assets, still insists on personallyapproving all major orders of supplies. Fifth Third's ratioof shareholder equity to assets, an important measure of abank's capital and thus of its ability to weather adversity,stands at 10.3%, a whopping 80% higher than the average ofbanks in the once-booming Northeast.   Michigan's second-largest bank, First of America BankCorp. of Kalamazoo, operates out of a converted YMCAbuilding. And it avoids more than frills: It won't give anysingle borrower more than $20 million in credit even thoughregulators would let it make individual loans as large as$250 million. The upshot: All the bad loans that First ofAmerica charged off last year total less than Bank ofBoston's one soured loan in Detroit.   Why is First of America so cautious? &quot;When the nation isgoing through a recession, we go through a depression,&quot; saysDaniel R. Smith, its chairman. &quot;Over the years, that makes abank get conservative quick -- or face failure.&quot;   Even in the automotive slump of the early 1980s, whenMichigan's unemployment rate reached a staggering 17.3% andOhio's hit 14.2%, only one major bank in the two states --Centran Corp., which was bought out by Society Corp. soonafterward -- reported a net loss.   In those years, when banks were consolidating in mostregions of the country, the industrial Midwest stayedgenerally uninvolved. Even Chicago's two largest banks, FirstChicago Corp. and Continental Illinois Corp., didn't go on abuying binge. More prone to money-center banking than theirsmaller neighbors, they were hobbled by ill-advised loans tothe oil industry and overseas borrowers as well as by staterestrictions on branch banking. Also unable to do much weremany Michigan banks, which were battered, though not reducedto wrecks, by the 1981-82 recession. In Indiana andWisconsin, none of the banks were large enough to be veryaggressive.   The result: The region's banks generally stayed withintheir neighborhoods. While the Southeast has six&quot;superregional&quot; banks whose assets top $20 billion, theindustrial Midwest has only three.   One of those three superregionals is Detroit's NBD BancorpInc., but it's so conservative that its chairman recentlyboasted that its initials stand for &quot;Nice, Big and Dull&quot;instead of its flagship National Bank of Detroit. &quot;We're inno hurry to get too big too fast,&quot; Chairman Charles T. FisherIII said at a shareholder meeting in Chicago. &quot;There's a lotof truth to the old saying, `If it grows like a weed, itprobably is a weed, because an oak tree doesn't grow likethat.'&quot;   Of course, impressive results in the past don't guaranteethe future. Bank of New England looked rock-solid to manypeople just a few months before it failed in January. Andalthough the Midwest hasn't seen the steep rise and then fallin real-estate prices that crippled many lenders elsewhere,the Chicago Fed's Mr. Gregorash cautions that the regionisn't immune to a slump in property values. Even some prudentMidwest banks are slightly increasing write-offs andloan-loss reserves.   Just last month, the credit ratings of National City Corp.of Cleveland and Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, werelowered by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. Sandamp;P's problem with both:increased reliance on debt to push expansion, including theacquisition of failed banks and thrifts.   Banc One -- with $30.3 billion in assets, the Great Lakesregion's largest banking company -- has clearly been the mostaggressive. It has staged buying forays throughout theMidwest and into Texas. Though it has declined to bid forBank of New England's remains, it is expected to push intothe Middle Atlantic states via some mergers. Despite thecredit downgrade, Banc One's financial ratios make it one ofthe country's strongest banks.   National City likewise ranks high despite some problemsstemming from its growth strategy. It estimates its troubledloans rose to $470 million at March 31 from $357 million atDec. 31, largely because of an Ohio thrift acquired inJanuary.   And a few Midwestern banks have hit deeper potholes intheir drive to branch into new businesses or markets. In thepast two years, Michigan National Corp. has sustained lossesfrom participation in farflung commercial real estate loans.Ameritrust Corp. of Cleveland, hurt by leveraged-buyoutcredits and rapid loan growth, reported a $96.4 million losslast year.   Yet if any banks are prepared to live through bad times aswell as good, they are in the Great Lakes region. Most of thearea's banks have little or no exposure to foreign loans orhighly leveraged credits.   While many lenders view the documentation, monitoring andcollection of loans as nerdy grunt work, NBD considers those&quot;details&quot; so important that it does something unusual: Itpays its head of data processing and other operations$385,450 a year, more than it pays its lending chief. NBD wasone of just five of the nation's top 50 banks to finish 1990with its stock higher than when the year began ($33 a sharevs. $32).   Manufacturers National Corp., the Detroit bank founded byHenry Ford during the Depression, reevaluated its real-estatelending policies two years ago -- not because the bank wasstarting to bleed from loan losses but because its executivessensed a weakening market.   &quot;Developers had been on a five-year boom around here, andinflation in real-estate values covers a lot of sins,&quot; saysManufacturers National chairman Gerald V. MacDonald. &quot;Wethought it would be better if we started slowing down.&quot;   So the bank raised the financial hurdles that developersmust clear to get a loan. The move proved timely. Earlierthis year, the FDIC called Detroit's commercial-real-estatemarket one of the softest in the nation, as Denver's Mr.Madden found out.   All this leaves many Midwestern banks with the problem ofmanaging success. As a group, they probably have the nation'sstrongest capital and market-value base from which to launchinterstate expansion -- and virtually all are doing so.   The irony is that, after long being so frugal and socautious, Midwestern banks have relatively little experiencewith major mergers. Thus it's unclear whether they cansuccessfully expand in markets where they rarely havefinanced even a simple strip mall. Detroit's Comerica Inc.,for example, stubbed its toe by venturing into the Texasauto-loan market in the mid-1980s. But Comerica hasrecovered, and Michigan banks' more recent expansion out ofstate -- notably into the Chicago area -- is going smoothlyso far.   And Great Lakes banks seem determined not to abandon theirconservatism. Executives at Old Kent Financial Corp. of GrandRapids, Mich., discourage loans more than two counties awayfrom an Old Kent branch. To ensure that his lenders hew to atight line, Old Kent Chairman John C. Canepa recentlydistributed photocopies of &quot;Sound Credit Principles,&quot; a bookwritten in 1952.   &quot;The {stock} market likes consistency,&quot; says Mr. Canepa,whose bank has raised its dividend every year since itsfounding in 1972. &quot;We used to get analysts and investorscoming to us complaining that we didn't have big blips inearnings. But now, consistency isn't so bad.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
