Kauffmann said Britain ``has abandoned'' John McCarthy, 32, atelevision reporter abducted on his way to Beirut airport.   ``British officials say they won't negotiate because it willonly lead to the taking of other hostages,'' Kauffmann told ameeting to mark the third anniversary of McCarthy's kidnapping. ``Isay you can negotiate without giving in.''   The French and West German governments managed to secure therelease of their hostages without being brought to their knees,Kauffmann said at the meeting organized by British and Frenchjournalists.   Kauffmann, a magazine writer and French citizen, was freed inMay 1988 after more than three years' captivity.   France, which was under constant pressure to get back itshostages, has denied paying ransom. It complied with severalIranian demands, including banishing the main Iranian oppositiongroup from Paris.   Kauffmann said he recently helped mark the start of the fifthanniversary in captivity of Terry Anderson, 42, the chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press and the longest held of15 Western hostages in Lebanon. Anderson was abducted March 16,1985.   ``There's something cruel in these anniversaries,'' Kauffmansaid.   Those at Monday's meeting at UNESCO headquarters issued anappeal to all with influence ``to do whatever they can immediatelyto help secure their release.''   Organizer Anthony Brock, a British writer, said the appeal wouldbe sent to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and theIranian and Syrian embassies in Paris.   Iran influences Moslem extremists holding the hostages, whileSyria is the main foreign power broker in Lebanon.   A group working for McCarthy's release ran cinema, televisionand newspaper advertisements Monday.   One asked moviegoers in Britain to close their eyes and think ofEngland, because McCarthy has ``done nothing else for the lastthree years.''   In a message with Arabic voice-over on Lebanese television, thehostage's father, Pat, told his son, ``Whatever you do, old chap,keep your spirits up.''   Similar messages were published in the Beirut daily As-Safir.Another message in the newspaper, signed ``Jill'' and apparentlyfrom McCarthy's girlfriend, Jill Morell, said: ``I wish more thananything that you could be back home with us. But until then, I'msending you all my special love.''   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held bypro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ McCarthy, Anglican envoyTerry Waite and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dualBritish and Irish nationality whose release is also sought by theIrish government.   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, aNew York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claimthey killed him. His body was never found.</TEXT></DOC>
