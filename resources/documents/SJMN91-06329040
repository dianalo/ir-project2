Back when Osborne stuffed a CP/M computer(that was the popular business computer before the IBM PC) into asuitcase-size box, 24 pounds and &quot;I can lift it&quot; were the pinnacle ofportability. Then Compaq made a bundle of money stuffing a PC compatible intoa similar size and weight. Then came lap-tops of 12 pounds or so and a singlefloppy disk drive.;   Now the &quot;notebook&quot; has taken over, with the typicalmachine weighing 6 or 7 pounds and packing a hard disk.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Computing  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  YOU CAN TAKE THESE 3 WITH YOU  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Hardware Review; Phillip Robinson is an author of books and articles aboutcomputers and an editor for Virtual Information of Sausalito.; Additionalinformation attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO><TEXT>     They have to compete with &quot;palm-top&quot; computers that weigh a pound or lessand can fit into a pocket. Although they don't include disk drives, they havememory &quot;cards&quot; that can fill the same function. Palm-tops can run for 20 timesas long as notebooks on a single battery charge. Of course their screens andkeyboards are much smaller, more useful for pecking out addresses or short e-mail messages and not for word processing or graphics.;   The Librex 386SX(Librex, $3,599, (408) 441- 8500) is a classic 1991-era notebook. Built arounda 20-megahertz 286SX chip, 4 megabytes of random access memory and a 60MB harddisk, it can run any PC program, including Windows. (You can buy it for lessif you choose a 20MB or 40MB hard disk.) Although the screen is monochrome (anLCD display, as most notebooks use), there's a port in back you can hook up toa desk-top color monitor. (There are also parallel and serial ports forhooking up a modem, a mouse and a printer.) This comes with a one-yearwarranty and a 24-hour free replacement guarantee during the first 100 days: agreat policy.;   The keyboard felt great to me, but then that's a personalmatter. The screen produced VGA resolution with 16 shades of gray. You won'tsettle for the older CGA and two-shade (black and white) displays once you'veseen this. However, I don't see much difference between the 16 shades and somecompeting machines with 32 shades of gray.;   The Librex is a small notebook,at just over 6 pounds and 8.4 by 11.7 by 2 inches. It also has a very smallAC-adapter, the power box you plug into the wall to recharge the notebook'sbatteries. Many notebooks have a huge AC-adapter, which should be added to thesystem weight because you'll always have to carry it. (Strangely, the Librexcarrying case doesn't have room for this tiny adapter -- you have to shove itinto some other piece of luggage.) The least pleasant side of the Librex wasits battery life. Running on batteries, it pooped out sooner than any otherportable I've used -- in less than an hour. I ended up using the Librex onlyat home or in the office, not while traveling.;   (Librex recently announced a&quot;docking station&quot; that the notebook could plug into, to add network adaptersand more disk drives. It also announced 386SL and 486 notebooks for nextspring.);   The Zenith MastersPort 386SL (Zenith, $4,499, (800) 553-0331)fights the &quot;dead-battery&quot; blues with the new 386SL processor chip. This chipis a 386SX processor with special new circuitry to conserve power.;   Anotheradvantage of those power-saving circuits is that you can just leave yourprograms running all of the time. You turn this computer off by putting itinto a standby mode instead of turning it off. That means the programs areinstantly on again whenever you wake the computer back up, saving a lot oftime. All computers should be this way.;   A little bigger than the Librex,the MastersPort weights 7 pounds (with its battery; always check to see thatcomparisons include the battery weight) and measures 8.3 by 12.4 by 1.8inches. It has a huge AC-adapter, but at least the carrying case makes roomfor it. One non-obvious advantage of the AC-adapter is that the Zenithrecharges in far less time than many competing systems, including the Librex.;  The Zenith runs at 20MHz, the same as the Librex, and comes standard with2MB of RAM and a 60MB hard disk. (The Librex can be outfitted with a largerhard disk as well.) The VGA LCD display is clear and easy-to- read: Zenith hasa good reputation for readable displays. Like the Librex it has a singlefloppy-disk drive, for 3.5-inch disks. It comes with Windows and DOS 5. Thekeyboard was OK but not as comfortable as the one on the Librex.;   Thismarket moves so quickly. Zenith introduced the first 386SL-based notebook inMay (the one I tested and reviewed here) and has already introduced a fastermodel, the 25MHz 386SLe. A number of other firms are on Zenith's heels, eitherintroducing their own 386SL notebooks or spurning the Intel processor in favorof the AMD 386 processor chip, which is faster and has its ownpower-conservation circuits.;   If you really want to run long, though, you'llmove to something like the HP 95LX (Hewlett-Packard, $699, (503) 757-2000). Itruns for hundreds of hours on a couple of standard AA batteries. This wonderweighs only 11 ounces, measures 6.3 by 3.4 by 1 inch, and still packs completePC compatibility.;   However, instead of a 386 processor it has the same 8088processor chip, and speed, of the original IBM PC. It has 512 kilobytes of RAMand no disk drive, though there is room for plug-in memory cards that can addanother 512K of RAM.;   The 95LX also has an LCD display, though it only showsone-fourth of a standard PC screen.;   The keyboard is laid out as a QWERTY,just like a notebook PC, but is too small for any touch-typing. In fact, itmore resembles a calculator.;   Inside the 95LX you'll find a bunch ofsoftware, including full calculator abilities, scheduling and memo utilities,DOS 3.22, and a copy of Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.2.;   There are also utilitiesfor communications.;   A number of companies are making 95LX add-ons forhandling e-mail and other such communications.;   I liked the Librex a lotwhen I used it in September. The keyboard was comfortable, the performancefine, compact size appealing and the price just right.;   Then I used theZenith and knew that I wouldn't settle for anything less than 386SL powerconservation. I could leave the Zenith on all day, and it would last becauseof the automatic power-down routines. That even made it worth carrying the bigpower supply. And I loved that its programs were always on.;   The 95LXexcited me when I first heard of it, but in practice it wasn't my machine. Idon't use Lotus or a financial calculator every day, and though I like thepocket-organizer abilities, I can get those for less money and weight with aSharp Wizard or with a typable keyboard for note-taking with the Poqet PC.;  Whichever portable you buy, look for discounts and deals. The hot competitionthis winter should mean falling prices all over.; Librex 386SX. $3,599 (with60 megabyte hard disk). From Librex Computer Systems Inc., 1731 TechnologyDrive, Suite 700, San Jose 95110. (408) 441-8500.;   Zenith MastersPort 386SL.$4,499 (with 60MB hard disk). From Zenith Data Systems, 2150 East Lake CookRoad, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089. (800) 553-0331.;   HP 95LX. $699. FromHewlett-Packard Co., 1000 Northeast Circle Blvd., Corvallis, OR 97330. (503)757-2000.; Summary: The Librex 386SX is a small, light notebook PC with agreat keyboard. The Zenith MastersPort 386SL is heavier, larger, and moreexpensive, with a keyboard I don't like as much but much longer battery lifebecause of the 386SL chip's power-conservation abilities. Either could be yourmain computer, but I prefer the Zenith for its battery life and instant-on.The HP 95LX is a pocket-size PC with a miniature keyboard and a quarter-sizescreen. It combines 1-2-3 spreadsheet and financial calculator abilities withaddress and schedule keeping. It can run for much longer on its batteries, andis much smaller and cheaper than the other two, but it could not serve as youronly computer. Remember with any portable computer that you're paying more forthe same performance than you would in a desk-top computer. Look for discountsand price cuts during this season of hot competition.; On a scale of one tofour, with one indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's how theproducts rate:; Librex 386SX:; 3 computers; Zenith MastersPort 386SL:; 3computers; HP 95LX:; 3 computers  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Phillip Robinson column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911124  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,478  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 24, 199100329040,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
