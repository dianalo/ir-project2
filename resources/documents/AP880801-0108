TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The decision by King Hussein of Jordan to cutties with the Israeli-occupied West Bank has alarmed Palestiniansand damaged the election hopes of Israeli Foreign Minister ShimonPeres.   The Jordanian monarch made it clear he was giving up his claimto the West Bank, which his grandfather King Abdullah annexed in1950 and which he lost to Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.   In deference to Arab and Palestinian demands, he said, Jordanwould dissolve ``legal and administrative links'' to Palestiniansin the occupied territories.   That remark prompted widespread concern among Palestinians, muchof it voiced privately, about how far Hussein will go in breakinghis ties with Palestinians in the occupied territories.   Jordanian influence is pervasive. Jordanian dinars are the maincurrency in the West Bank, Jordanian law is used in the courts, andJordanian textbooks are used in the schools.   More importantly, nearly 1 million Palestinians from the WestBank and Jerusalem carry Jordanian passports and the kingdistributes about $70 million to $100 million a year in salaries,scholarships and stipends.   Diplomatic observers believe Hussein will be cautious incarrying out such steps so as not to stir unrest among Palestinianswho account for about two-thirds of Jordan's 2.4 million population.   But many Palestinians fear Hussein may limit the validity ofpassports or refuse to issue new ones. He also has the power torestrict visits across the Jordan River bridges.   Jordan can delay, reduce or cancel altogether stipends paid to13,000 teachers, lawyers, ex-Jordanian government workers andofficials of Islamic institutions.   The expectation was that Hussein would gradually introduce newmeasures defining Jordan's new relationship with Palestinians inthe occupied territories. Hussein supporters warned the changewould be dramatic.   ``Nobody appreciates the magnitude of what is happening,'' saidOthman Hallak, editor of the pro-Jordan Arabic daily An Naharnewspaper in Jerusalem.   He said there were serious questions about whether Israel wouldallow the PLO to take over Jordan's behind-the-scenes role insupporting agriculture, education and Moslem charities.   It was even more doubtful whether Israel was willing to engagein any form of dialogue with the PLO.   Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat is viewedby both major Israeli political blocs as an unacceptable partnerfor negotiations because of his reliance on terrorism and the PLO'scommitment to destroying the Jewish state.   Peres, the head of the left-of-center Labor Party, invested agreat deal of credibility in promoting Hussein as a stand-innegotiator for the PLO.   Hussein's spurning of a leading role was therefore a seriousembarrassment for Peres, who already is trailing right-wing PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir in polls conducted in advance of Israel'sNov. 1 election.   Peres had dueled repeatedly with Shamir in public over the needfor an international conference on Middle East peace. Peres saidsuch a conference would give Hussein a cover to talk directly toIsrael about the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, somethingthe monarch could not do otherwise.   Peres said he worked out a framework for negotiations withHussein at an April 11, 1987, meeting in London. He said themonarch agreed that Palestinians negotiators in a joint delegationwith Jordan would not be affiliated with the PLO.   Israeli officials, especially those close to Peres, have soughtto play down the importance of Hussein's measures. They argued thatthe moves were tactical and Hussein was waiting to be called on forhelp if the PLO was unable to meet the challenge.   ``It is a signal to the (Palestinian) inhabitants of theterritories not to forget who they depend on,'' said Ephraim Sneh,a former West Bank military governor who belongs to the Labor Party.   He predicted Hussein would resume a more active role after theIsraeli and U.S. elections in November.   Israeli officials also stressed there has been little tangibleimpact from the two concrete steps Hussein has taken: dissolvingparliament or halting a five-year development program that camenowhere near raising a promised $1.3 billion.   But the 60-member lower house of parliament, which included 30West Bankers, and the development scheme were symbols, started whenHussein wanted to signal his desire to broaden Jordan's influenceand take an active role in peace negotiations.   In his televised speech Sunday night, Hussein said he wouldcontinue to play a role in peace efforts but made it clear that hisposition would be more in tune with the policies of other Arabstates and the PLO.   To underscore commitment to Arab unity for West Bankers who areable to view Jordan television, Hussein sat in front of a largeportrait of Emir Hussein Bin Aly, his great-grandfather and thefirst modern leader to mobilize pan-Arab forces for a 1916 revoltagainst Ottoman Turkey.   ``Jordan will play a role as an Arab country and a confrontationstate, but the role of representing the Palestinians falls to thePLO,'' said Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Nick Tatro has reported for The Associated Pressfrom the Middle East since 1977, reporting from Cairo, Beirut,Tehran and Jerusalem.</TEXT></DOC>
