The systemhas been monitored for some years enabling us to quantify the energybalance. Since heat is supplied using a mix of different energies, theenergy balance is not wholly satisfactory. The energy and exergy balancesare compared. They reveal a great difference. The exergy balance allowsus to highlight the most important irreversibilities of the process.</TEXT></DOC>
