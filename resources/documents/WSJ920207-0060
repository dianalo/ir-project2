If the proposal is enacted, millions of workers might gainat least minimal retirement benefits. Some specialists thinkthis at last is a pension proposal that small-business ownerswill like. But others think owners will reject it as tooexpensive.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's a good possibility that this proposal, unlikepast attempts, will actually generate some employerinterest,&quot; says John F. Woyke, a principal in Towers Perrin,a Valhalla, N.Y., consulting firm specializing in employeebenefits and compensation. The proposed plan &quot;is the type ofprogram that an insurance company or bank could marketsuccessfully,&quot; he adds.   Not so, says Denise Georgemiller, a consultant with HewittAssociates, Lincolnshire, Ill. &quot;This proposal won't beattractive to many small employers,&quot; she says. &quot;They're goingto perceive it as too expensive.&quot; Gerald L. Uslander, aprincipal in the Washington, D.C., office of consultantWilliam M. Mercer Inc., predicts: &quot;Small business is going tosay it wouldn't use such a plan.&quot;   Under the proposed Small Business Model Retirement Plan,many more companies -- those with fewer than 100 workers,rather than 25 as at present -- could make salary-reductionarrangements with employees to fund simple retirement plans.Unlike the current plan it would replace, the new plan wouldrequire employers to match employee contributions, thussweetening total benefits.   No employer would be forced to provide such a retirementplan, or any at all. But employers with such plans wouldcontribute an annual amount equal to at least 1% of eachemployee's pay. Employees -- virtually all workers would beincluded in the plans -- could put a maximum of $3,000 each(or 25% of pay, whichever is less) in their retirementaccounts each year. Employers would match employeecontributions, dollar-for-dollar up to the first 3% of salaryand at half that rate for the next 2%.   The Bush proposal, which was buried in a TreasuryDepartment report last week summarizing his new budgetpackage, is still unfamiliar even to some specialists insmall-company retirement plans, much less to many businessowners. Yet it is likely to get consideration by manycompanies that don't like the current pension rules.   For instance, Martin G. Imbach Inc., a Baltimoremarine-construction company, usually employs more than 50,but says it has no retirement plan. &quot;The reasons are cost,complexity and compliance,&quot; says Eamonn McGeady, president.   Now, however, &quot;It sounds like the Bush people tried tocome up with something that makes more sense for smallcompanies,&quot; Mr. McGeady says. If Congress authorizes the newtype of pension plan, &quot;It's certainly something we would lookat,&quot; he adds.   But others already think the plan would be too costly, atleast for them. George A. Burnell, president of Icon Corp., aWoburn, Mass., machinery maker that usually employs between25 and 40 workers, says he would have &quot;no interest&quot; in a planrequiring company contributions even in a bad year for thebusiness. Icon has no retirement plan, although it wasweighing options for creating one when the recession hit; itthen tabled the matter.   In lacking retirement benefits, Icon's workers are hardlyalone. By one federal estimate, only 23% of employees incompanies with fewer than 100 workers currently have pensioncoverage, compared with 66% at larger companies.Small-business employers widely complain about costs and redtape, which the Bush plan aims to alleviate.   Under current law, the simplest retirement plans thatsmall-business employers may establish are called SimplifiedEmployee Pension plans, or SEPs. These may involve companycontributions to employee Individual Retirement Accounts. Butcompanies with fewer than 25 employees may fund the plansthrough salary-reduction pacts, in which employees trade awaya portion of current salary for tax-deferred retirementmoney. SEPs aren't very popular, in part because employersmust meet strict anti-discrimination rules aimed atpreventing highly paid workers (including owners) fromtax-sheltering too much money in comparison with lower-paidworkers.   Several plans to spur small-company pensions, generallycalled pension-simplification plans, hit Capitol Hill lastyear. One was an earlier administration plan called Power(for Pension Opportunities for Workers' Expanded Retirement).Under the pension-simplification plans, employers who metcertain minimum-funding rules would automatically be deemedto have non-discriminatory retirement programs.   But last year's pension proposals encountered resistanceover cost. &quot;Employers don't want to get rid of thenondiscrimination rules if it's going to be too expensive,&quot;says Mr. Uslander, the Mercer consultant.   Specialists disagree over whether the latest plan would beless costly to small companies that adopted it, than thePower plan would be. Towers Perrin notes that a key provision-- the 1% minimum company contribution for all eligibleworkers, regardless of whether they contributed themselves --compares with 2% in the Power plan. The new figure &quot;isprobably low enough that it won't be an impediment&quot; topension-plan starts, Towers Perrin's Mr. Woyke says. Butothers say even 1% is too costly -- not to mention thematching provisions.   For now, small-business lobbyists are reacting cautiouslyto the plan. &quot;Ideally, we'd like a plan that's very easy toadminister, but also very inexpensive insofar as it paysbenefits,&quot; says D.J. Gribbin, a lobbyist for the NationalFederation of Independent Business, the largestsmall-business group. But the group has taken no position onthe Bush proposal yet, he adds.   Many small employers are in no hurry. Small-businesslobbyists and consultants say the No. 1 compensation issue atsmall companies is health coverage, not pensions. Moreover,the pension issue for many small-business owners is gettingbigger pensions for themselves and for favorite workers,rather than for all workers, concedes Mr. Gribbin of theNational Federation of Independent Business.   Even if the small-business community were wild about theBush proposal, Congress might not be. Ms. Georgemiller, theHewitt consultant, says the proposal is among a group ofcompensation and benefits proposals that together would drainsome $100 million in tax revenue this year if enacted. Theretirement proposal's deferred tax provision, of course,would postpone tax revenue. &quot;The thing that could killsomething like this is that it's a revenue loser,&quot; she says.   On the other hand, Ms. Georgemiller notes that in thiselection year, many politicians might wish to be associatedwith pension moves on behalf of small-company workers wholack benefits now. She says of the Bush plan, &quot;It's a nicepopulist kind of benefit.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
