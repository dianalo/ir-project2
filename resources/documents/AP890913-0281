The machines give youngsters easy access to tobacco and send amessage that this country isn't worried that they will becomeaddicted, Koop said.   ``There is no logical reason why we should have a double standardfor controlling the sale of tobacco and alcohol, the two major legaladdicting drugs used in our society,'' he told a congressionalhearing.   ``Would we tolerate the sale of alcoholic beverages throughvending machines? Would we allow free samples of alcoholic beveragesto be sent through the mail or passed out on public property? Ofcourse not,'' he said.   Koop, whose tenure as the nation's health policy chief ends thismonth, said 43 states have laws on the books banning tobacco salesto minors, but don't enforce them.   ``As long as states take no action to enforce these laws, Isupport federal efforts to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors,''he said in testimony to the House Energy and Commerce subcommitteeon transportation and hazardous materials.   Subcommittee Chairman Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, is pressing for afederal law restricting tobacco vending machine sales.   At a previous hearing on Luken's bill, the Tobacco Institute,citing a report by a vending machine trade organization, theNational Automatic Merchandising Association, said only 2{ percentof teen-age smokers bought their cigarettes from machines.   A federal limit on vending machine sales ``is a solution insearch of a problem,'' said institute spokesman Charles O. Whitley.``It would pursue its goal at the cost of severe economicconsequences for an industry already beset by high taxes andburdensome regulation.''   Whitley told the panel that ``Most cigarette vending machines arelocated in factories, offices and other establishments that are notopen to the publlic or generally are not frequented by persons under18.''   About eight out of 10 cigarette machines are nowhere near areasfrequented by teen-agers, according to the Tobacco Institutetestimony.   But Koop said that is enough machines to justify federal action.   ``Even if true, and I'm not convinced it is, it's a poor argumentagainst banning vending machine sales of cigarettes,'' Koop said inhis statement. ``Even 20 percent of the 374,000 vending machines inthe United States represents a huge number of sites from whichteen-agers can readily obtain cigarettes, illegally.''   Koop also told the panel he opposes the U.S. government's crusadeto force Thailand into repealing its ban on tobacco advertising.   He said America is not respected overseas ``because of the mannerin which we export disease and death to underdeveloped countries.''</TEXT></DOC>
