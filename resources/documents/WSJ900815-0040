This brought a downturn inreal estate, which in turn left banks and other lenders withheavy losses.   &quot;I don't see the sort of direct contagion in theseproblems that will lead to national recession, and while theyare an important feature of the economic and financialenvironment that must be considered as we make our decisions,I don't believe that they `interfere' with the conduct ofmonetary policy in a fundamental way,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
