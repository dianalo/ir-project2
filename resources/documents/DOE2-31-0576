Data for a series of fatigue cycletests on simple vessels with single stiffeners are presented. Modificationsmade to the system, including redesign of the ACPD contact and incorporationof a watertight gland to enable underwater operation, are discussed andillustrated, and the results of these modifications are evaluated. Datafor test vessels are plotted. The system can size cracks to within 0.75mm, provide data on crack growth rate, identify the effects of interruptionsin fatigue cycling, and monitor crack closure and opening during fatiguecycling.</TEXT></DOC>
