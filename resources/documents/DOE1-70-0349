<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-70-0349 </DOCNO><TEXT>A nonlinear electrostatic gyrokinetic Vlasov equation, as well as Poissonequation, has been derived in a form suitable for particle simulationstudies of tokamak microturbulence and associated anomalous transport.This work differs from the existing nonlinear gyrokinetic theories intoroidal geometry, since the present equations conserve energy whileretaining the crucial linear and nonlinear polarization physics. In thederivation, the action-variational Lie perturbation method is utilizedin order to preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the original Vlasov-Poissonsystem. Emphasis is placed on the dominant physics of the collectivefluctuations in toroidal geometry, rather than on details of particleorbits. 13 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
