A banana war.</LP><TEXT>   On one side is the Honduran subsidiary of the U.S. companyChiquita Brands International Inc. -- formerly United BrandsCo., earlier United Fruit Co. On the other is an upstartex-subsidiary of Chiquita's, Fyffes Group Ltd., now owned bythe big Irish-British fruit importer Fyffes PLC. Fyffesprecipitated hostilities this year by ordering bananas from agrower that Chiquita says has an ironclad contract to supplyChiquita.   The outside world's appetite for bananas is strong, anddemand will grow with Europe's economic integration andEastern Europe's developing ability to import. But the supplyof green gold, so-called by banana men because it is cut andshipped green, is limited. It greatly disturbs Chiquita thata major supplier has defected to Fyffes. Chiquita says itwill enforce compliance with its contract, but strictly bylegal and ethical means.   &quot;We can't afford to let Fyffes get that fruit,&quot; saysManuel Rodriguez, a Chiquita vice president wearing aguayabera in his temporary office in the old company town ofLa Lima. Fyffes Chairman Neil McCann counters: &quot;We will stayhere as long as necessary.&quot;   In Honduras, Chiquita's 80 or 90 other independent growersare following the war with great interest. The independentsaccount for nearly one-third of the 34 million boxes ofbananas Chiquita shipped from Honduras last year. &quot;This is{Chiquita's} biggest and best division,&quot; says Laurence Swan,a Fyffes marketing executive. &quot;Lose it here, and that's it.&quot;Independent banana growers in Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica andColombia would love to see more competition from buyers andare watching the fight, too. &quot;If people realize Fyffes caninduce producers to break contracts, then everybody will doit,&quot; says Chiquita's Mr. Rodriguez.   &quot;It's the most serious threat the U.S. banana companieshave had to their privileged position, perhaps since thebeginning of the century,&quot; says Mark Rosenberg, a Hondurasexpert at Florida International University.   For the moment, Chiquita -- whose United Fruit predecessorwas called &quot;the Octopus&quot; by Hondurans -- has prevailed. ElTiempo, Honduras's most influential newspaper, haseditorialized acidly that the &quot;banana republic system&quot; isalive and well in Honduras, if nowhere else. The maincasualties of the war have been bananas. Chiquita hasobtained a court order that has empowered officials toconfiscate about 300,000 boxes of Fyffes-bound bananas, worthabout $3.6 million abroad.   Some of the seized fruit has been pilfered and some hasspoiled. Most has been sold for small change in Honduras,where the demand for bananas is not exactly insatiable. Thisstrikes Fyffes partisans as tragic. &quot;As a professional bananaman, I'm appalled,&quot; says Tim Stickney, a Fyffes agriculturalspecialist in Belize.   At the heart of the war is a contract dispute betweenChiquita and the Echeverri family, Honduras's largestindependent banana growers. Chiquita accuses Fyffes of payingthe Echeverris $2.5 million to break their company'slong-term contract with Chiquita in order to sell to Fyffes,which offers higher prices -- and pays in dollars, ratherthan the shaky Honduran lempira.   The Echeverris assert that the contract has expired andthat, in any case, Chiquita itself had violated certainprovisions, thereby voiding it. Fyffes says that theEcheverris are free to sell to whom they please and that ithas done nothing wrong.   One Honduran judge has ruled for Chiquita. In a differentlegal action, another judge has ruled that the Echeverris cansell their fruit to Fyffes. Chiquita's judge, however, seemsto have more muscle.   Through legal maneuvering -- and, Chiquita men say, theintimidating presence of hundreds of banana workers at theport -- Fyffes and the Echeverris were able to ship threeboatloads of bananas from Puerto Cortes in early spring.Since May 11, however, a Fyffes freighter, the Frost Cetus,has bobbed fruitlessly at the harbor, at a cost of $5,000 aday.   Court officials, accompanied at times by soldiers incombat gear, have confiscated truckload after truckload offruit. Chiquita's Mr. Rodriguez says that the Hondurangovernment and military, initially confused by the legalmaneuvering, now are fully aware of Chiquita's superior legalposition.   In March and April, court officials supervised theunloading of more than 2,000 tons of bananas from two vesselschartered to Fyffes by Seatrade Groningen B.V., a Dutchconcern. In one instance, the ship company says, the captainreported that his ship was unloaded at gunpoint -- although ajudge on the scene denied in an affidavit that any force wasused. More recently, three trainloads and 68 truckloads ofgreen gold were confiscated. On the way to port, onefruit-laden train was derailed when its locomotive, crewmensaid, hit a railroad spike that someone had jammed into thespace between two lengths of rail. At a press conference twodays later, lawyers for Chiquita's subsidiary denied anyresponsibility for the incident.   On a recent night at the port, a police lieutenant,toothpick firmly planted in his jaw, orders the confiscationof three truckloads bound for the Frost Cetus. A woman in aflaming pink dress, Marta Moran, who is a lawyer for theEcheverris, suddenly appears on the scene and waves a courtpaper in the officer's face. &quot;Show me your order]&quot; she barks.&quot;My paper against your paper]&quot;   Sullen stevedores press in on the lieutenant and his fourmen, who carry rifles. &quot;Load the bananas]&quot; one of the dockworkers shouts. &quot;I have four cubs at home who have to eat.&quot;   The police retreat, but the Fyffes-Echeverri victory isshort-lived. The judge on Chiquita's side has been foundpartying at Studio 54, a discotheque, and again approvesseizure of the bananas. The lieutenant returns to the dockwith a court order -- and a dozen soldiers in battle gear.The three truckloads of bananas are impounded.   In another recent incident, witnesses say, police withautomatic rifles, accompanied by at least two Chiquitaemployees and a Chiquita lawyer who is an alternate member ofthe Honduran supreme court, burst into a hotel here. Theysought to detain for questioning a Fyffes official and theFyffes agent who arranged the Echeverri agreement.   Confronted by the hotel manager, the raiding party wasunable to produce proper warrants. The Fyffes men had escapedanyway; one had ducked out a back entrance. But a visitingFyffes director who resembled one of the wanted men wasalmost arrested, witnesses say. Chiquita says its lawyer wasthere to identify the Fyffes men, for whom there were validarrest warrants.   Some Fyffes officials now travel with bodyguards and masktheir identities. Two executives carry 90,000-volt stun gunsbought in Miami. &quot;I'll take one {captor} with me, if needbe,&quot; one jokes nervously.   Peace talks have begun. Last week, about eight securityguards from both sides waited in the lobby of a hotel in SanPedro Sula, their guns discreetly hidden from view, aslawyers from Chiquita and Fyffes held what a Fyffes mancalled a &quot;tense&quot; three-hour meeting. Both sides pledged toseek ground on which to resolve their dispute.   There are diplomatic pressures to do so. The two sides metthis week after gentle prodding from the American and Britishambassadors here; they had responded to a request from thepresident of Honduras. Ireland, the home of Fyffes PLC, hasno representation here. But the Fyffes Group subsidiary isheadquartered in London. The British ambassador to Hondurasis Peter Streams, a heavyset, cigar-smoking diplomat given towearing pale-pink safari outfits on his visits to PuertoCortes. He says he has &quot;expressed concern&quot; over the disputemany times to the Honduran government.   Also on the diplomatic front, Fyffes offcials have metwith officials of the European Community in Brussels.Chiquita officials, Mr. Streams says, have explained theirposition to the British Foreign Office in London. U.S.Ambassador Cresencio Arcos says the dispute has become a&quot;loselose&quot; situation for Honduras, with total victory by oneside or another damaging the nation's reputation either inthe U.S. or in Europe. He is counseling the antagonists toreach a &quot;mutually acceptable agreement.&quot;   As a Chiquita subsidiary, Fyffes Group had acquired mostof its bananas from former British colonies -- Belize,Jamaica, the Windward Islands -- and from Surinam, and soldthem in the British market. In 1986, FII PLC bought FyffesGroup. As part of the deal, United Brands (now Chiquita) gota minority interest in the new FII Fyffes (now Fyffes). Then,last September, United Brands sold its interest in Fyffes.&quot;We didn't think it was a very valuable company,&quot; says aChiquita spokeswoman in Cincinnati.   Mr. Swan says Fyffes never meant to start a war withChiquita. But it needed an additional source of bananas, andto enter Honduras -- next door to Belize, where Fyffes hadlong sent ships -- &quot;was a logical geographic decision,&quot; hesays.   Fyffes is the fifth-largest company whose shares aretraded on the Dublin stock exchange. But with total sales of$600 million a year it is dwarfed by Chiquita, whose bananasales alone last year were $1.4 billion.   If Chiquita has been winning the legal side of the war,the affair has been a public-relations disaster. Thespectacle of Chiquita squashing a Honduran grower that hadmanaged to get better terms from Chiquita's much smallercompetitor has rekindled Hondurans' historical resentment of&quot;the Octopus.&quot; In the bad old days, Hondurans say, thecompany &quot;made and unmade presidents.&quot;   Some U.S. diplomats are irritated by all this. One saysthat tactics of the Fyffes and the Echeverris have exploitedthe negative side of the U.S. firm's history in Honduras and&quot;sparked a smear campaign.&quot;   As recently as 1974, during the last banana war (which wasset off by a fight for market share between United Brands andCastle andamp; Cooke Inc.'s Latin American subsidiary, StandardFruit Co.), United Brands paid $1.25 million to Hondurangovernment officials to lower a banana export tax. In 1975,shortly before the bribes became public knowledge, UnitedBrands Chairman Eli Black committed suicide by jumping fromhis New York office window. The Honduran government latercollapsed.   In the green fields and tin-roofed packing stations of theEcheverri farm, the sympathies of sweat-drenched bananaworkers clearly lie with Fyffes. Since the Echeverris begandealing with Fyffes, wages have jumped, in some cases evendoubling to about $10 for a 12-hour day from $5. Sundayovertime at double pay has become common. Fyffes accepts eventhe smaller bananas at the bottom of a bunch, for whichChiquita had no use.   &quot;Chiquita threw away down from here,&quot; says Oscar Bonilla,a lanky man with a mouthful of gold teeth, his hand halfwaydown a strand of bananas hooked to a wire assembly line.&quot;With Fyffes, we use the whole strand. We pack more boxes, weearn more money.&quot;   Workers say that for years, under the Chiquita contract,the Echeverris were strapped for cash and couldn't meet someof the obligations they had agreed to in labor negotiations.(Chiquita says the farm has been badly run.) But if Fyffes'smoney keeps flowing in, the workers expect more benefits,including housing, that had been stalled earlier. &quot;If we haveto go to the port 20 times, we will do it,&quot; vows Mr. Bonilla.&quot;If we have to load the fruit ourselves, we will do it. If wehave to fight, we will do it.&quot;   But in Puerto Cortes, Simon Templeman, Fyffes's beardedshipping manager, sits slumped on the dock watching asanother truckload of confiscated bananas is driven away.&quot;This is what happens in a banana republic,&quot; he saysdejectedly. &quot;The big guys win.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
