(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Take The PlungeandM;Consider how many doctors, dentists, architects, and lawyers (especiallylawyers) work in the United States.andP;  There are literally hundreds ofthousands, and many have two or more personal computers in their offices.andO;Then consider how many small- and medium-sized companies in America have cometo rely on PCs to help run their businesses.andP;  (We'll define small- andmedium-sized companies shortly.)andP;  The numbers here rank in the millions.andM;How many of these PCs operate as standalone machines, each connected to itsown printer or modem or plotter?andP;  And how many of these offices could reapthe benefits derived from networking?andP;  Again, literally millions.andM;These impressive figures--and the potential market value theyrepresent--haven't escaped the notice of local area networking productvendors.andP;  In fact, many of them perceive the entry-level LAN arena as a vastuntapped market ripe for exploitation by their low-cost,easy-to-install-and-use connectivity solutions.andM;A growing list of networking products we can classify as entry-level atteststo the strength of this market.andP;  From complete board-cable-and-softwarepackages to pocket adapters that allow a portable PC to connect to a network,the options for networking &quot;on the cheap&quot; continue to expand rapdily.andM;&quot;From the figures we've seen,&quot; says Alex DuBrow, president of US Sage, heAmerican subsidiary of a British firm that developed and markets theentry-level MainLan networking starter pack, &quot;the greatest potential rightnow in terms of new [network] sales is in the small-to-medium-sized businessarea--it's the greatest untapped market.andP;  They're not in a position wherethey can afford a large network.&quot;andM;According to the Small Business Administration, 45 percent of businesses with$1 to 30 million in revenues do not have PCs.andP;  And a full 71 percent ofbusinesses with under $1 million in revenues do not have PCs.andP;  Thesecompanies can't afford to be the technology leaders, but they don't want toget left behind, either.andM;What Small IsandM;Before continuing, it's probably worthwhile to define some of the terms we'vethrown around so far.andP;  For instance, agreeing on what cheap and entry levelmean can be impossible.andP;  Chrysler or General Motors, for example, wouldn'tthink twice about spending the thousands of dollars it costs for a dedicatedserver, adapter boards, software, cabling, and other associated equipment toconnect seven or eight PCs with Novell's NetWare ELS (for entry-levelsystem).andP;  A mom-and-pop retail shop using a PC-based system to run its cashregisters, however, might find it difficult to justify spending more than$500 or $600 to link its point-of-sale machines into a two-node LAN.andM;Similarly, defining a small- or mediume-sized firm forces one to think interms of number of PCs in use as well as number of workers employed.andP;  For thepurposes of a LAN integrator, a five-lawyer office with 10 PCs (one for eachattorney, another for each attorney's secretary or legal assistant) fits thesame category as a much larger firm--a manufacturer, for instance--withseveral dozen production people but only a handful of clerical/professionalworkers with PCs.andM;Ana Sackett, a marketing representative for Waterloo Microsystems (Waterloo,Ont., Canada), the developer of the Port and Port Lite low-end networkoperating systems, offers this definition of what a small-to-medium businessis from Waterloo's perspective: &quot;In terms of PCs, they have at least three tomaybe about 20,&quot; she explains.andP;  &quot;A company with more than 20 PCs [in anetwork] will require additional capabilities&quot; not generally available withentry-level products such as Port Lite and MainLan.andM;For example, Waterloo's Port offers more communications functionality thanPort Lite.andP;  &quot;Port has wide area networking features not in Port Lite,&quot;Sackett says.andP;  &quot;Port Lite is also simpler in format and easier to use, with auser interface that is simpler.andP;  And Port Lite is easier to install--we'vetried to make the maintenance of it as simple as possble by automating thingsas much as we can.&quot;andP;  (We'll describe Port Lite and MainLan, along withseveral other products, in greater detail later.)andM;Waterloo also feels that the 20-to-25-PC range is the limit for what can becalled entry level.andP;  Port Lite supports up to 25 PCs on a single workgroup,but &quot;once you get beyond that, it's not a starter LAN anymore, you're pastentry level, and now you need some WAN capabilities and other featuresprovided by a high-end product.&quot;andM;Ease of use and ease of administration are far more important in entry-levelLANs than with its full-blown cousin.andP;  In these small companies ordepartments, the person who knows how to make the printer work becomes the defactor LAN administrator.andP;  Managing the LAN could mean doing tasks as simpleas adding new users, but if the NOS interface is not intuitive, thenontechnical administrator will feel like he is administering MVS.andM;&quot;Most industry participants are aware of the complexity and are trying tomake their networking products easier to install and use.andP;  However, most oftheir Randamp;D efforts appear to be devoted to performance and features, seeking acompetitive edge, busily introducing powerful new workstations, exoticmultitasking operating systems, interconnected workgroup applications, andcomplex communication systems,&quot; write Gilbert Hoxie and Harold Cypress in anArthur D. Little paper discussing the crisis in network management called&quot;The Computer Networking Nightmare...Any Support In a Storm?&quot;andM;&quot;Yet many of these systems combinations are harder to buy, harder to install,harder to learn, and even harder to use than the standard PCs they areintended to replace.andP;  Whatever happened to 'ease of use' as a competitiveedge?andP;  It's alive but not doing well,&quot; the report says.andM;Another DefinitionandM;Debbie Daun of Artisoft, the Tucson, Ariz., company that develops and marketsLANtastic--which, like Sage's MainLan and Waterloo's Port Lite, is availablein a starter kit with everything needed to connect and get a small networkrunning--provides some additional insights into the entry-level market.andM;&quot;Some [LANtastic] networks are large installations, but the bulk of our salesis to companies with fewer than 25 employees,&quot; says Daun.andP;  Some figures fromArtisoft's warrantly registration forms: More than half of Artisoft's users,who have installed 128,000-plus LANtastic nodes, work in companies with oneto 25 employees; only 11 percent of Artisoft's customers have more than 500employees.andP;  The average LANtastic network contains five nodes, and a third ofthem are two-node LANs (if they can be called that).andP;  In all, 86 percent ofthe LANtastic sites have 10 or fewer PCs.andM;Despite the relative lack of individual unit sales, Artisoft still views theentry-level market &quot;as virtually untapped,&quot; adds Daun.andP;  &quot;Most businesses inAmerica are medium-sized, and most of them have two or more PCs on theirdesks.andP;  There's an incredible amount there for entry-level networking.&quot;andM;An International Data Corp. (IDC) report, titled &quot;A Qualitative Analysis ofthe PC LAN Operating System market&quot; and released in September 1989, said thatthe average number of nodes in a typical network was 9.51 in 1989.andP;  This isup from 6.56 in 1986, 7.15 in 1987, and 8.33 in 1988 (see Figure 1).andP;  IDC, aFramingham, Mass., market research firm, projects the average network willcontain 10.52 nodes by the end of this year and 14.35 at the end of 1993.andM;Also according to IDS data, 80 percent of LANs have only 5 to 6 nodes.andO;Although the vas majority of attention is focused on the Fortune 1000, theyonly own 20 percent of all LANs.andM;&quot;So, the average number of PCs on a network is small, and that's the marketwe're hitting,&quot; says Sackett.andM;Who's Buying CheapandM;As might be expected, the typical customer for an entry-level LAN is &quot;a verysmall business, perhaps a start-up with only two computers, or a branch salesoffice of a larger company, where they need to network a secretary andexecutive,&quot; says Mandy Bunting, product manager for CBIS's (Atlanta)Network-OS, an inexpensive (as low as $10 per node) peer-to-peer networkoperating system (NOS).andM;&quot;We're located in Georgia, and especially here we find a big demand [forNetwork-OS]&quot;, Bunting adds.andP;  CBIS's customers, like those of the othervendors of entry-level workgroup products, encompass a wide range of fieldsand industries.andM;&quot;We sell to anyone from real estate brokers to the person who opens his orher own company selling radio-television advertising--in other words, anyonewho has more than one computer and needs to share information in a moreformalized manner than running disks back and forth between offices,&quot; saysBunting.andM;These customers &quot;aren't looking for anything special in access time--even aslow network is fast compared to the time it takes to copy data to a disk,walk to the second PC and copy it again,&quot; Bunting says.andP;  &quot;These people aren'tconcerned about speed or security features; they're small companies, likefamilies working together, who just need to access information.andM;&quot;They want something that's easy to install and inexpensive--they don't wantto spend $3,000 to get their network together,&quot; Bunting continues.andP;  &quot;And theywant it easy to install so they can do it themselves, without going to asystem integrator or paying consultants for their time.&quot;andM;The educational field is another key area for entry-level networkingproducts, according to Steven Joe of D-Link Systems (Irvine, Calif.), whichsells LANsmart, a NetBIOS-compatible peer-to-peer NOS.andP;  &quot;Our market is theend user with two to 20 nodes,&quot; says Joe.andP;  LANsmart can support up to 50users, &quot;but if you want high performance, use NetWare.&quot;andM;The educational environment offers great potential because, as much asanything, educators are looking for inexpensive products that can link smallgroups of PCs easily.andP;  US Sage's DuBrow concurs: &quot;Recently, we've seen a lotof interest in the educational field.andP;  There are a lot of Apples in there,and IBM is pushing more and more [into the educational market].andP;  So they'relooking fro an IBM-compatible network, and most educators do not have themoney for Novell networks.&quot;andM;DuBrow also admits that Sage's customers are a diversified lot.andP;  &quot;It variesso much, everything from professionals--lawyers, doctors, CPAs--down tomom-and-dad grocery stores and print shops,&quot; he says.andM;A Look at Some ProductsandM;US Sage's MainLan, D-Link's LANsmart, CBIS's Network-OS, and WaterlooMicrosystems's Port Lite are just four of the many entry-level products onthe market today.andP;  Others available--we'll take a look at some ofthem--include DNA Network's (Malvern, Pa.) MegaNet and MicroNet, TOPSMicrosystems's (Santa Clara, Calif.)andP;  TOPS (versions are available forMacintosh, MS-DOS, and Sun computers), Moses Computers (Los Gatos, Calif.)andO;PromiseLAN, 3X USA's (Fort Lee, N.J.) 3X-Link 16, Invisible Software's(Foster City, Calif.) NET/30 NOS.andP;  O'NEILL Communications (Princeton, N.J.)andO;LAWN, and Axon Computer's (Beverly Hills, Calif.) LAN Model F200.andM;In addition, 3Com (Santa Clara) and Novell (Provo, Utah) also sell what theycall entry-level NOS packages; these are entry level only in the sense thatthey support a limited number of users--eight in the case of 3Com's 3+OpenLAN Manager, four in the case of Novell's NetWare ELS Level I, and eight inthe case of ELS Level II.andP;  Neither of these packages is entry-level in termsof functionality (or cost); however, and both require dedicatinghigh-performance computers as servers and using standard LAN cabling andnetwork interface drivers.andP;  In short, they are entry-level systems for thosewho eventually plan to migrate to a larger network system.andM;Samsung (San Jose, Calif.) has announced its intent to offer starterNetWare-based networks with everything you need to hook up a small network;specific details were unavailable at this writing, however.andM;&quot;High tech isn't a saleable thing,&quot; says Philip Vertin, senior vice presidentof sales and marketing at Samsung.andP;  &quot;Customers are not looking for a LANsolution, they are looking for a business solution.&quot;andM;US Sage's MainLanandM;US Sage's MainLan fits into the all-in-one category: The company's LANstarter pack contains two of Sage's proprietary half-size network interfaceboards (for IBM PCs and compatibles), the MainLan operating software, a15-foot serial-style cable with end plugs, and installation and userdocumentation.andM;This kit allows connecting two PCs into a peer-to-peer network that retailsfor $499; up to 64 nodes can be daisy-chained to form a lager workgroup, saysSage's DuBrow.andP;  Additional MainLan adapter cards, which contain only threechips, one of which is smaller than a dime, cost $199 and come with thenecessary cabling.andM;The newest revision (3.0) of MainLan's NOS, which is MS-DOS-based and fullyNetBIOS-compatible, according to DuBrow, requires only 33KB of RAM on a PCconfigured as a workstation, 55KB on one acting as a server.andP;  On peer-to-peernetworks, users can access the information from all the disks within thenetwork; users have the option of operating their PCs as servers, which theother PCs on the network can access, or simply as workstations.andP;  Becauseservers provide greater functionality than workstations, they require moreprogram code.andM;MainLan 3.0 is also compatible with the extended-memory specification (EMS).andO;When used in this environmental, workstation RAM requirements drop to 16KB,server needs to about 32KB, sayd DuBrow.andM;MainLan runs &quot;virtually every DOS application,&quot; DuBrow adds, noting that itis also compatible with the newly released version of Microsoft's Windows(also version 3.0).andP;  &quot;To my knowledge,&quot; he says, &quot;mainLan is the only productin the peer-to-peer category that is Windows 3.0 compatible.&quot;andM;Another key selling point of MainLan, he says, is that it is &quot;fully NetWarecompatible: If a user [outgrows MainLan and] wants to install NetWare ELS,they can keep the same card and cable we supply--data is transmitted anderror-correction performed the same way as regular Ethernet.&quot;andM;The MainLan boards exchange data at 4Mbps.andP;  They use the same carrier-sensemultiple-access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method employed byEthernet and the IEEE's 802.3 standard, according to DuBrow.andM;MainLan offers a wide range of network services, including shared printing,electronic mail facilities, disk sharing, basic security limitations, andsupports DOS file and record-locking.andM;MainLan, which is distributed through independent software dealers, includingComputerLand, appeals to people who &quot;need to share software and printers andwant a network that is simple, that you can forget about when you'recommunicating,&quot; says DuBrow.andP;  &quot;Is it simple?andP;  Absolutely.&quot;andM;Waterloo's Port LiteandM;Port Life is another product available in a two-node, starter-kit-typepackage, with the hardware (two Arcnet adapters and twisted-pair cable) andsoftware.andP;  Although there's sufficient hardware for just two machines, thePort Lite Starter LAN software supports five users.andP;  This system sells for$995.andM;Waterloo allows adding users to the basic setup in five-user increments usinga Port Lite Expander, which sells for $495.andP;  A Port Lite network can supportonly 25 workstations, however.andP;  &quot;Once you get beyond 25, it's not a starterLAN anymore,&quot; says Waterloo's Sackett, &quot;and you need some of the other thingsprovided by our highend, Port.&quot;andM;Port Lite is DOS- and NetBIOS-compatible, and--as one can assume fromSackett's comments--Port Lite workgroups can easily migrate up to Portstatus.andP;  Port offers internetworking capabilities not included in Port Lite.andO;The latter product supports printer and file sharing and contains its owne-mail package.andM;In addition to supporting Arcnet, Port Lite can run over Token Ring cabling.andO;Ethernet capabilities are in development, says Sackett, and should beavailable this fall.andM;Waterloo sells Port Life primarily through a small network of independentcomputer dealers and value-added resellers (VARs), although it does have &quot;afew OEM arrangements,&quot; according to Sackett.andP;  &quot;We're trying to establish aU.S.andP;  presence,&quot; she explains, &quot;and we're in the process of looking for amajor U.S.andP;  distributor.&quot;andM;Artisoft's LANtasticandM;Artisoft also packages its entry-level LAN product, LANtastic, in anall-in-one LANtastic Starter Kit, which costs $525 for a two-node workgroup.andO;Like those already described, this product ships with two adapters, cable,terminators, documentation, and software (in this case, the entry-level NOSlicense supports up to 120 users).andM;Individual LANtastic adapters, have a proprietary design and operate at2Mbps.andP;  They sell for $249.andM;In addition to the 2Mbps LAN, LANtastic offers a .7Mbps alternative of itstwo-node network for $325; the NOS software license for this product supportsonly eight users.andP;  Additional adapters for the low-speed network are $149.andM;Artisoft also sells 16-bit Ethernet cards ($349), a two-node Ethernet LANStarter Kit ($725), an adapter-independent version of its NOS calledLANtastic NOS/AI ($425), and a serial-parallel board-based LAN product calledLANtastic Z, which supports two users for $199.andP;  LANtastic is a DOS-basedpeer-to-peer network OS that requires 12KB on a workstation, 40KB on aserver.andM;The LANtastic NOS/AI software allows other vendors' NetBIOS-compatibleadapters to support LANtastic networks.andP;  Among those boards compatible withthis package are Western Digital's.andP;  One interesting feature of Artisoft'sLANtastic Z: It can run concurrently with a &quot;regular&quot; LANtastic LAN.andP;  Userssimply have to install LANtastic 2Mbps and LANtastic Z adapters in their PC,and the operating system switches between the two cards transparently,depending on which network the application being used is located on.andM;Artisoft added yet another interesting feature to its product this spring:Version 3.0 of the LANtastic NOS supports both voice mail and e-mail, to usethe voice mail capabilities, users must purchase and install LANtastic's newvoice adapter in their PC.andP;  On-screen menus give users the option of sendingand/or receiving their electronically generated mail via voice or in standarddata format, according to Debbie Daun.andP;  Other enhancements in version 3.0:new disk caching routines, a menu-driven installation procedure, and theability to exceed DOS's open-file limit.andM;D-Link's LANsmartandM;D-Link System's LANsmart network OS, which costs $495, supports unlimitedusers in a peer-to-peer Net-BIOS-compatible environment, says D-Link's SteveJoe.andP;  LANsmart offers compatibility with Novell's IPX protocol, giving usersthe convenience of running both NetWare and LANsmart as well as an easyupgrade path should they require higher performance.andM;D-Link also offers Ethernet adapter cards and its own quick-and-easy LANmagicstarter kits.andP;  These retail for $1,245 (for an eight-bit ISA-compatibleEthernet package that runs both NetWare and LANsmart) to $1,445 (for aconcurrent NetWare/LANsmart LANmagic version compatible with IBM's MicroChannel bus).andP;  Other LANmagic/LANsmart starter kits are available for 16-bitAT bus machines ($1,355) and the Micro Channel bus ($1,385).andP;  ConcurrentLANsmart/NetWare starter kits are available in eight-bit ($1,245) and 16-bitAT ($1,385) versions.andM;These kits include a variety of components, depending on the environmentthey're designed for.andP;  All ship with either one or two of the appropriateD-Link network adapters (these are Ethernet cards with standard ISA 8- and16-bit or Micro Channel buses), LANsmart NOS software, and a NetWare driver.andO;Some also include TCP/IP support, segments of thin Ethernet coaxial cable,and 50-ohm BNC terminators.andM;&quot;[NetWare] concurrency gives NetWare peer-to-peer capabilities,&quot; Joe says.andO;&quot;Most entry-level network operating systems are close [in functionality andperformance],&quot; he adds.andP;  &quot;But later on, when a company grows, the problem ofmigrating to NetWare is that you need another hardware card with them.&quot;andM;The NetWare compatibility means users don't have to make this adapterinvestment, though.andP;  &quot;And you can keep the same software, too,&quot; Joe says.andM;He also states that the LANsmart NOS installation process &quot;takes probablyfive minutes once you get the hardware installed,&quot; and LANsmart can also runwith drivers for Sun Microsystems' PC-NFS protocols as well as DECnet.andP;  Onceup and running, LANsmart requires only 2KB at the workstation, 80KB at theserver.andM;CBIS's Network-OSandM;CBIS markets two entry-level products: It's full-function Network-OS and alow-performance Network EZ package, which includes the hardware and softwarenecessary to create a three-node network.andM;Network EZ, according to CBIS product manager Mandy Bunting, contains two25-foot cables, three bus-based network cards, software, and documentationand sells for $600.andP;  &quot;This is basically a low-end version of our Network-OS,&quot;says Bunting.andP;  &quot;We took out some of the bells and whistles that cost more.andO;For instance, it doesn't include e-mail.&quot;andM;Customers can add a second Network EZ package to create a six-node network,the maximum this product will support.andP;  Network EZ is sold primarily throughdirect contact with end-users, according to Bunting.andP;  This is possiblebecause of Network EZ's simplicity of use and operation--there's very littlepost-sale training or support required.andM;Bunting says that CBIS's bus cards can coexist with the full-featuredNetwork-OS; in this configuration, a Network-OS LAN can support up to 255users.andM;CBIS sells Network-OS through a network of 1,500 systems integrators anddealers worldwide, and CBIS has OEM agreements with four major companies,including Datapoint.andP;  Like most of the other products described in thisarticle, Network-OS is a NetBIOS-compatible peer-to-peer NOS.andM;Network-OS operates on the full range of IBM PC- and PS/2-compatiblecomputers that are NetBIOS-compatible; it offers multi-printer and multilevelsecurity support and conforms to the NetWare record and file lockingconventions.andP;  In addition, portions of the network code can be loaded intoexpanded memory, leaving more of the so-called &quot;DOS memory&quot; (that in thefirst 640KB) free for applictions access.andM;CBIS sells Network-OS in both per-node and per-license agreements, accordingto Bunting; for example, a 10-user license costs $595, an 80-user license$1,480, and a 255-user license $2,550.andM;Moses' PromiseLANandM;One of the more interestingly-named products, Moses Computers' PromiseLAN, atanput $125 per node, is also one of the more competitive, price-wise, on themarket.andP;  PromiseLAN is made up of hardware (organized in a master-slav eformat, with connections between linked PCs made with RJ- 11 phone jacks andunshielded twisted-pair wiring) and software, called PromiseLOCK, the NOS.andM;PromiseLAN workgroups must be wired in a star topology, and separate starscan be linked into a larger network by connecting two wiring hubs together.andO;PromiseLAN offers a 1Mbps data-transmission rate.andP;  In this configuration,master adapter boards contain four RJ-11 phone plugs, with each running to aslave board.andM;PromiseLOCK 3.0, released at fall 1989 Comdex, uses the IBM SMB (servermessage block) protocol; in addition to being compatible with the PromiseLANadapters, PromiseLOCK can be used on a &quot;common&quot; PC that acts as a gatewaybetween a Moses PromiseLAN and IBM PC LAN network.andP;  A PromiseLOCK workstationrequires 15KB of RAM, a server, 25kb; this latter figure includes printspooling/despooling capabilities, and can be adjusted for additional speed byassigning another 10KB to the server module.andM;Invisible's Invisible NetworksandM;Invisible Software markets two low-cost ways to get into networking:Invisible Network, a proprietary networking product, and Invisible Ethernet.andO;Both products (Invisible Network actually comes in three models at twodifferent bit rates) run on Invisible's NET/30 NOS.andM;&quot;Invisble Network with NET/30 offers high performance at a low price,&quot; saysinvisible's Jay Aydelotte.andP;  On PCs equipped with expanded memory, thepeer-to-peer NET/30 OS uses only 3KB of DOS RAM for a workstation, 13KB for aserver.andP;  Invisible also offers a number of enhancement products, including amemory-expansion board and boot PROMS that allow diskless PCs to boot upremotely.andM;As noted, Invisible sells three models of its Invisible Network: Model 200,which costs $215, is an 8-bit for PC XT/AT-compatibles that runs at 1.8Mbps;Model 300($315), is an 8/16-bit version for PC XT/AT-compatibles, and Model200/A ($399) is a 16-bit version for IBMS's Micro Channel bus that runs at1.8Mbps.andP;  Invisible Network runs on dual twisted-pair wiring, and InvisibleSoftware ships all three models with its NET/30 NOS.andM;NET/30 of fers print and file sharing, print spooling, electronic mail, andan easy-to-use menu system, according to Invisible Software.andP;  It is alsocompatible with NetBIOS, the IBM PC LAN Program, and Netware.andM;Invisible Ethernet, Invisible Software's 10Mbps v ersion of its product, isalso shipped with NET/30; a $399 Invisible Ethernet package also includes aremote PROM; available options include a 25-foot thin coaxial cable ($20) anda cable terminator ($5).andM;DNA Network's MicroNetandM;DNA Network's MicroNet, &quot;designed for smaller end-user environments,&quot;according to DNA president Bruce Quigley, operates at 2Mbps using DNA'spatented alarm-bit recognition and cache technology.andM;MicroNet comes in a two-user kit, for $345, which includes DNA's networkoperating system, management software, boards, and shielded twisted-pairtelephone-grade wire.andM;MicroNet uses less than 40KB on the master board, and only 1.5KB on aworkstation, according to Quigley.andP;  MicroNet adapters can support up to500-foot twisted-pair runs, and can access facsimile machines, modems, andCD-ROM drives.andM;MicroNet is also NetBIOS-compatible, with DNA's NOS residing as a devicedriver to DOS.andP;  All of the desktop tools in use with DNA's products are menudriven.andM;DNA recently added directory and queue manager facilities to MicroNet and thecompany's 100Mbps MegaNet product.andP;  The directory manager expedites copyingmultiple files from subdirectories by allowing users to tag multiple files.andO;The queue manager gives users the status of a print job or executableoperation on a specific workstation or peripheral.andM;DNA also added a group scheduler and &quot;notepad&quot; text editor to its list offeatures.andP;  The latter allows creating a personal online &quot;rolodex.&quot;andM;Two Serial AlternativesandM;Taking the cover off a PC is too technical for many.andP;  RS-232 LANs, which willnever be speed demons nor support distributed processing, are sufficient formany small companies' or departments' needs.andP;  RS-232 LANs do not use networkadapter cards, hence their other name, zero-slot LANs.andP;  This saves both theexpense of purchasing the card and the trouble of installing it.andP;  RS-232 LANscan usually be installed within a matter of minutes.andP;  Anyone who has lookedup a printer or a modem to a PC has the necessary skills to install an RS-232LAN.andP;  Some RS-232 LANs are daisy-chained, others use a central hub.andP;  Eitherway, one end of the cable is plugged into the PC's serial port or parallelport.andM;This type of network will be slow.andP;  At best, transfer rates will be about500Kbps.andP;  But it is faster than passing around floppy disks and cheaper thana card-based LAN.andP;  And it's reasonably easy to troubleshoot.andM;While the primary purpose of Travelling Software's Laplink is to connect PCsand laptops, it is a perfect candidate for an entry-level LAN.andP;  UsingLaplink, someone with no LAN expertise can share files between two computers.andO;A boss and her secretary can be sharing files in a matter of minutes.andM;Laplink transfers information at a maximum of 200Kbps over serial cable or500Kbps over parallel connectors.andP;
