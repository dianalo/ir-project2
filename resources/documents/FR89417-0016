Milkman, ExecutiveDirector (703) 557-1145.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> On October 27, 1986, the Presidentsigned the Freedom of Information Reform (FOIA) Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-570).This legislation amended the FOIA to provide broader exemption protectionfor law enforcement information and modified the Act's fee and fee waiverprovisions. On January 19, 1988, the Committee published a proposed rulerevising its FOIA regulations accordingly. The fee provisions conform tothe uniform FOIA fee schedule and guidelines promulgated by OMB, 52 FR10011-10020 (March 27, 1987). In issuing the fee waiver criteria, policyguidance issued by the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987 was considered.Public comment was invited, with the comment period extending to March15, 1988. During that period, comments were received from one interestgroup representing the media. A discussion of their comments follows: <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee should furnish records ``promptly'' ratherthan ``within a reasonable time'' as proposed. <T3>Response:</T3> The Committee Regulations at andSection; 51-7.7(c) havebeen revised to provide the records ``as soon as possible.'' <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee should offer assistance to requesters whodo not reasonably describe the information that they request. <T3>Response:</T3> andSection; 51-7.2(a) of the Committee's regulations havebeen revised to include: ``Where a request does not reasonably describethe requested information, the requester will be asked to provide morespecific information.'' <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee's proposed business notification procedureswould interfere with and regularly prevent the agency from adhering tothe 10-day time limit for responding to FOIA requests. <T3>Response:</T3> andSection; 51-7.8(a) in part states that in respondingto an FOIA request, if the Committee cannot readily determine whether theinformation is privileged or confidential business information, it willobtain and consider the views of the submitter of the information and providethe submitter at least 10 working days to object to any decision to disclosethe information. The Committee believes that business submitters of informationshould be afforded an opportunity to object to the release of informationconsidered privileged or confidential. Further, taking time extensionsfor the purpose of consulting  with submitters of information is consistentwith court decisions and the intent of Executive Order 12600, ``PredisclosureNotification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information,'' June1987. <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee should not defer its responsibility forgranting or denying requests if another agency has ``primary responsibility''for the requested records. <T3>Response:</T3> FOIA does not preclude an agency from referring requestsfor records to the agency which has primary responsibility for the requestedrecords, particularly where the primary agency is in the best positionto determine whether records must be disclosed or whether an exemptioncan and should be asserted. This practice is not unusual among federalagencies. <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee's regulations should indicate that recordsdenied to an FOIA requester will be preserved for the life of the Statuteof Limitations regarding those records. <T3>Response:</T3> The Committee addresses ``Preservation of Records''at andSection; 51-7.16 in its regulations. The Committee will comply withall applicable recordkeeping requirements. <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee in its regulations should eliminate orredefine its definition of ``representative of the news media.''  <T3>Response:</T3> The Committee's definition was taken from the OMB feeguidelines which were made final only after a period of public commentduring which concerns were raised and considered. The statute specificallymandates that agencies follow OMB guidelines in promulgating their ownregulations. The Committee believes that its definition properly implementsthe statutory terms of the amended Act. <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee should make it easier to obtain fee waiverson requests for information. <T3>Response:</T3> The Committee's fee waiver regulations are based onand in compliance with the Department of Justice guidelines issued on April2, 1987. The Committee has reviewed these guidelines and believes theyare in accord with the 1986 fee waiver amendments to FOIA. Special concernsraised by the commenter have been addressed by the Department in its noticeof final rulemaking, 52 FR 33230-33231 (September 2, 1987). <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee's regulations violate the Paperwork ReductionAct by requiring FOIA requesters seeking waiver of fees to provide proofof entitlement. The Committee should be able to determine from the initialrequest whether a fee is justified. <T3>Response:</T3> The Committee agrees that, in many instances, the initialrequest itself may provide sufficient information for the Committee tomake a fee waiver determination. However, the Committee recognizes thatthere will be instances where the initial request does not provide sufficientinformation. In such  cases, the requester should be given an opportunityto provide additional justification. Accordingly, the Committee's regulationshave been revised to allow for this circumstance. The Committee believesits fee waiver procedures are in compliance with the Paperwork ReductionAct. <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee's proposed regulations on fee waivers shouldexclude the news dissemination function from its test to determine therequester's commercial interest. <T3>Response:</T3> The Department of Justice in its fee waiver guidelinesindicated that news gathering and dissemination by established news mediaorganizations, as a rule, should not be considered to be ``primarily''in their commercial interest. However, the Department indicated there areinstances such as ``the disclosure of agency records to data brokers orothers who compile and market Government information for direct economicreturn which can more readily be considered as primarily in the commercialinterests of the requester.'' The Committee concurs with the Department'sstatement, that each agency is best situated to make a comparative assessmentas to the likely effects of disclosure of its own records. <T3>Comment:</T3> The Committee's prepayment requirement interferes withthe agency's requirement to provide information promptly, and the media'sability to provide timely dissemination of information. <T3>Response: </T3>The Committee believes its prepayment requirement isfair and necessary. Further, both the Act and OMB guidelines specificallyprovide for prepayment of fees. <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous </ITAG>In the proposed rule as published, the Committee did not include the statutoryrequirement that extensions of time for responding to a request may beextended for a total of 10 working days, divided between the initial responseand the appeal response. The Committee has recognized this oversight andhas added conforming language to andSection; 51-7.11. The Committee has alsorecognized that it did not include the usual and customary 30-day timeframe for the submission of appeals to initial denials of records, andit has amended andSection; 51-7.10 accordingly. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 41 CFR Part 51-7 </ITAG>Freedom of Information.41 CFR Part 51-7 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1-7 PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF AGENCY MATERIALS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.1 Purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.2 Scope. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.3 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.4 Availability of materials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.5 Requests for records. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.6 Aggregating requests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.7 Committee response to requests for records. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.8 Business information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.9 Records of other agencies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.10 Appeals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.11 Extensions of time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.12 Fee schedule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.13 Fees charged by category of requester. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.14 Fee waivers and reductions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.15 Collection of fees and charges. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.16 Preservation of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 552. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 51-7.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose. </ITAG>These regulations implement the provisions of the ``Freedom of InformationAct,'' 5 U.S.C. 552.

(f) Charges for unsuccessful searches, or searches which fail to locaterecords or which locate records which are exempt from disclosure, shallbe assessed at the same fee rate as searches which result in disclosureof records. (g) The fee for providing review services shall be the hourly salary rate(i.e., basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee conducting the reviewto determine whether any information is exempt from mandatory disclosure.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 51-7.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees charged by category of requester. </ITAG>(a) Under the FOIA, as amended, there are four categories of FOIA requesters:Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions;representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The Act prescribesspecific levels of fees for each category. (b) Commercial use requesters. For commercial use requesters, the Committeeshall assess charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for,reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Commercial userequesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 freepages of reproduction of documents referenced in andSection; 51-7.12(c)(1).The Committee may charge for the cost of searching for and reviewing recordsfor commercial use requesters even if there is ultimately no disclosureof records. (1) A commercial use requester is defined as one who seeks informationfor a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interestsof the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. (2) In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this categorythe Committee must determine whether the requester will put the documentsto a commercial use. Where the Committee has reasonable cause to doubtthe use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where thatuse is not clear from the request itself, the Committee may seek additionalclarification from the requester. (c) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters. Feesfor this category of requesters shall be limited to the cost of providingduplication service alone, minus the charge for the first 100 reproducedpages. No charge shall be made for search or review services. To qualifyfor this category, requesters must show that the request is being madeas authorized by and under the auspices of an eligible institution andthat the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought infurtherance of scholarly research (if the request is from a non-commercialscientific institution). (1) The term ``educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a publicor private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate highereducation, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institutionof professional education, and an institution of vocational education,which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. (2) The term ``non-commercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, and which is operated solelyfor the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of whichare not intended to promote any particular product or industry. (d) Requesters who are representatives of the news media_Fees for thiscategory of requesters shall also be limited to the cost of providing duplicationservice alone, minus the charge for the first 100 reproduced pages. Nocharge shall be made for providing search for review services. Requestsin this category must not be made for a commercial use. (1) The term ``representative of the news media'' refers to any personactively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated topublish or broadcast news to the public. (2) The term ``news'' means information that is about current events orthat would be of current interest to the public. (3) Examples of news media entities include television or radio stationsbroadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals whichdisseminate news and who make their products available for purchase orsubscription by the general public.
