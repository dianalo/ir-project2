Exposure concentrations were 0.0 (control), 0.3and 0.6 ppm. A subgroup (N = 36) also underwent exposures to Los Angelesarea ambient air at times when NO{sub 2} pollution was expected. Concentrationsof NO{sub 2} during ambient exposures were 0.086 +/- 0.024 ppm (mean+/- s.d.). All exposures took place in a movable chamber/laboratory facility.Each study lasted 2 hr, with alternating 10 min periods of exercise (meanventilation rate 40 L/min) and rest. Lung function was measured priorto exposure and after 10 min, 1 hr and 2 hr of exposure. Symptoms wererecorded prior to exposure, during exposure and for 1 week afterward.In some subjects bronchial reactivity to cold air was measured 1 hr afterthe end of exposure and again 24 hr later. Different exposure conditionswere presented in randomized order, 1 week apart. No pollutant exposureproduced statistically significant changes in lung function, symptoms,or bronchial reactivity, relative to clean air. Ambient air exposuresproduced the largest (still nonsignificant) mean changes in some lungfunction tests. Given the physiological and atmospheric variability,negative statistical results do not rule out a small unfavorable effectof ambient pollution on lung function. If any such effect occurred, itwas not likely caused by NO{sub 2}. Statistical results remained negativewhen the analysis was restricted to the 20 subjects with most severelung dysfunction. In conclusion at least in the Los Angeles area, sensitivityto ambient concentrations of NO{sub 2} is not common, even among adultasthmatics with moderate to severe disease.</TEXT></DOC>
