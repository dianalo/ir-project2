Waving handkerchiefs and clutching bags packed with clothes andradios, the refugees boarded a Boeing 737 at Hong Kong's airport andtook off for Hanoi.   From there, the 46 men, 40 women, 17 boys and 18 girls will betaken to their hometowns and monitored by the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees.   ``I think this is an extremely hopeful sign,'' said Robert vanLeeuwen, head of the U.N. refugee office in Hong Kong, as the jet'sengines roared behind him. ``The Vietnamese seemed very hopeful togo back.''   Originally, 124 people had volunteered to return, but three wereforced to stay in Hong Kong for medical reasons, van Leeuwen said.   He said 190 more were waiting to return to Vietnam and between600 and 700 more refugees had applied to go back.   ``Voluntary repatriation is the best shot,'' he said. The remarkwas significant because Vietnam and Britain are negotiating a planto force many of the 51,000 Vietnamese refugees to return. TheUnited States has said it opposes forced repatriation.   Hanoi's communist government has said it won't prosecute thosereturning to the country, one of the poorest in Asia. U.N. officialson Thursday reiterated that they would monitor the returningrefugees closely.   Until last year, Hong Kong allowed all Vietnamese refugees theright to settle in the British colony if they could not immigrate toanother country. But under a tough policy instituted in June, thegovernment ruled out resettlement for new refugees unless they couldprove they were escaping political persecution.   Since then, about 38,300 Vietnanmese have sailed to Hong Kong andare being housed in a series of camps, detention centers and halfwayhouses in the crowded colony of 5 million people. About 4,700 livein tents on a nearby island and another 1,800 cram five ferries inconditions the United Nations has called ``life-threatening.''   The government began a voluntary repatriation program in March,and groups of 75 and 68 refugees have returned.   Van Leeuwen said although the voluntary repatriation program hadbegun slowly, he had hopes that it would soon accelerate.   He said adult returnees had been given $150 and children 14 yearsor under $75 to return. Previous groups had been given $50 foradults and $25 for children.   The departure comes at a time when Hong Kong is under pressurefrom the United Nations to improve the conditions in the camps.   A preliminary report earlier this week said boat people on Tai AChau island and on five ferries in Hong Kong's harbor were in dangerof dying because of malnutrition and disease.   Last week, another U.N. official said the camps were some of theworst he had seen, saying the space given to some refugees ``is evenless than what is supposed to be given here for a dog.''   The U.N. also has alleged police beat about 100 boat peopleduring a July 23 disturbance at a detention center in the NewTerritories section of Hong Kong.   Several of the boat people said they were going home because theymissed their families.   In the Philippines, meanwhile, a U.N. refugee agency said 166Vietnamese boat people landed in the country in August.   A report by the Manila representative of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees said the most recent arrival occurredMonday, when 21 Vietnamese reached Lawak island off Palawanprovince, 360 miles southwest of Manila.   The August arrivals brought to 5,438 the number of boat peoplewho have landed in the Philippines this year, the report said.Although the month is far from over, a source who asked not to beidentified said the August arrivals so far indicate a decline fromthe 604 Vietnamese refugees who landed in the Philippines during thesame month last year.</TEXT></DOC>
