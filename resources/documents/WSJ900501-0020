Esber Jr. resigned yesterday as chairman andchief executive officer of Ashton-Tate Corp., and executivesclose to the once-dominant software company said it may befor sale. However, a company official denied it was on theblock.   Ashton-Tate, which has reported sinking sales and fourquarterly losses in a row, didn't immediately name a clearsuccessor to 37-year-old Mr. Esber, who held the top spot formore than five years.</LP><TEXT>   The company named Carmelo J. Santoro, 48, a board memberand chief executive officer of Silicon Systems Inc, a Tustin,Calif., semiconductor company, to the position of chairman.It also named William P. Lyons, 45, who was previously vicepresident and general manager of AshtonTate's applicationsgroup, to the positions of chief operating officer andpresident.   People close to the company said Ashton-Tate retainedPaineWebber Inc. to solicit offers, but it hasn't made anyannouncement that it is for sale. At least one serious buyersurfaced, but backed off this month when it decided thatAshton-Tate's price tag, reportedly $300 million, was toohigh, according to individuals familiar with the talks.   Mr. Esber's departure may have changed any plans to sellAshton-Tate. The company has a current market capitalizationof about $300 million. At $300 million, though, Ashton-Tatemight still be a good buy to certain software companiesseeking to extend their product line. &quot;Whoever buys Tate isbuying the database market,&quot; said Nancy McSharry, an analystat International Data Corp. Currently, Ashton-Tate holds anestimated 42% of the personal-computer database market, downsharply from almost 60% three years ago.   Mr. Lyons denied that Ashton-Tate is for sale, although aspokeswoman for the company confirmed that PaineWebber hasbeen retained to &quot;investigate proposals brought before it.&quot;   A 19-year veteran of International Business Machines Co.,Mr. Lyons joined the company about two years ago. He said hewas &quot;delighted&quot; to take the helm of Ashton-Tate and promisedto improve the company's performance by introducing newproducts in &quot;regular, predictable releases.&quot;   That could be a tall order. Competitors have hired some ofAshton-Tate's best technical people, and customers are tiredof seeing the company fail to meet promised deadlines for thecompletion of new products.   &quot;When will Ashton-Tate ship a product that lives up toexpectations? It has yet to be proven they will,&quot; said ScottSmith, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. &quot;Talk ischeap here. They have to deliver.&quot;   For years, Ashton-Tate dominated the business of sellingdatabase software to users of personal computers, butrecently its position has slipped badly because it failed tokeep pace with technical changes in its field. The companyalso faces continuing embarrassment from its inability toship a long-delayed new version of its flagship dBASEproduct.   In recent months, Mr. Esber had suggested that Ashton-Tatehad almost completed work on a long-delayed revision of itsflagship product called dBASE. But industry sources now saythat the company won't have the revision out by June, as Mr.Esber had hoped.   &quot;I'd certainly say Ed Esber's resignation doesn't increasemy confidence in the imminent shipment of {a new} dBASE,&quot; Mr.Smith said.   In an interview yesterday, Mr. Lyons said that Mr. Esber'sresignation had nothing to do with finishing work on the newversion of dBASE. He added that he was &quot;very pleased with theprogress we're making&quot; on dBASE and noted that on April 19the company sent its sixth test version of the new product to2,000 potential customers. However, he declined to estimatewhen the company would ship the product.   Without a new version of dBASE, Ashton-Tate's sales haveslumped. For the first quarter, the company reported a lossof $1 million on sales of $57 million. A year ago, it earned$11.5 million on sales of $89.8 million. For all of 1989,Ashton-Tate posted a net loss of $28.6 million on sales of$265.3 million.   Various software companies have benefited fromAshton-Tate's miscues, but analysts said the biggest winnerlong-term seems to be Oracle Corp., which built its businesson sales of database software for minicomputers and is nowgoing after personal computers, too.   Mr. Esber served as Ashton-Tate's chief executive foralmost six years. Early in his tenure, the company grewrapidly, but an acquisition strategy aimed at easing thecompany's dependence on database sales was a failure, and thedeparture of key engineers made it difficult for the companyto keep pace with technical advances in its core business.   Last year, sales tumbled when the company discoveredexcessive inventory of some products and announced that a newversion of dBASE had fallen far behind schedule.   Mr. Esber will remain on Ashton-Tate's board. In aninterview yesterday, he said he believed his decision toresign was &quot;in the best interests of the company&quot; and citedpersonal reasons for his departure, including the birth of achild last week.</TEXT></DOC>
