The official Xinhua News Agency said Liu Huaqiu, an assistant toForeign Minister Qian Qichen, expressed China's indignation anddelivered a strong protest to Ambassador James Lilley.   The Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress,China's legislature, issued a separate protest charging thatCongress ``willfully distorted the facts about China's efforts toput an end to turmoil and quell the counterrevolutionary rebellionin Beijing.''   The protests were the latest in a series of recriminationsreflecting U.S. outrage over the Chinese army's crackdown onpro-democracy protesters and Chinese outrage over any foreigncomment on its domestic politics. Relations have deteriorated totheir lowest level since the two countries established diplomaticties in 1979.   Both the House of Representatives and the Senate separatelyapproved legislative amendments calling for a range of sanctions inaddition to President Bush's previous halt to military sales andhigh-level exchanges.   Among other things, both houses called for suspending the use ofU.S. funds to support trade with China. The Senate also called forsuspending satellite exports that would be launched by China and forsuspending nuclear cooperation.   The amendments have yet to be signed into law.   ``The two amendments ... slandered and attacked the Chinesegovernment in a groundless manner,'' Xinhua quoted Liu as tellingLilley. The U.S. Embassy refused comment on Lilley's response.   A separate Foreign Ministry statement read to reporters accusedCongress of ``pursuing power politics in a deliberate attempt toharm Chinese-U.S. relations.''   In Washington, 42 Republican senators signed a letter deliveredto the Chinese Embassy that predicted ``tremendous'' damage tobilateral relations ``should your government continue on the courseof state-sponsored violence and intimidation on which you areembarked.''   But despite both sides' talk of damaged relations, an Americandiplomat in Beijing said neither side wanted to end the relationshipaltogether.   ``There are some (Chinese) people, a small group of people, whothink the United States is a bad influence and want to see (theinfluence) limited,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   On the American side, he said, there was a sense ofdisillusionment because in the past, ``there was a kind of culturethat said the relationship was special.''   At the Foreign Ministry's weekly news conference, spokeswoman LiJinhua denied that China plans to cut economic ties with the UnitedStates and other countries that have criticized its crackdown.   Ms. Li also said Chinese soldiers were ``acting according totheir orders and ... performing their normal tasks'' in searchingforeign diplomats' cars at checkpoints in Beijing and sometimessticking guns in their faces.   ``Foreigners should abide by the orders issued by the martial lawenforcement troops,'' she said when asked if such searches werelegal.   Military checkpoints go up around Beijing after midnight, andseveral diplomats have reported that soldiers searched their cars inapparent violation of international agreements on diplomaticimmunity.   Ms. Li also maintained that China has not banned sales of allforeign newspapers and magazines in Beijing, although she said shecould not name any foreign publications still allowed. Officialswent to hotels and stores in Beijing last week and took foreignpapers and magazines from newstands. None has been allowed on salesince.   ``We do not refuse all foreign books and magazines andnewspapers,'' the spokeswoman said. ``But we do not alow thoseforeign magazines and newspapers whose content interferes in China'sinternal affairs and hurts the national feelings of the Chinesepeople to spread unchecked on Chinese soil. This is quite natural.''   She refused to comment on the number of people arrested since thecrackdown on the protests began, or on persistent reports thatfugitive student leader Wang Dan has been arrested.</TEXT></DOC>
