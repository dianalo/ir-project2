Bethlehem's third-quarter loss of 88 cents a sharecontrasted with earnings of $10.1 million, or five cents ashare, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell 7.2% to $1.12billion from $1.21 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Bethlehem also said that even though demand began tostrengthen in the third quarter, it expects to post afourth-quarter loss as a result of higher costs coupled withintense price competition and an uneven economic recovery.   Separately, Bethlehem said it and British Steel PLC havedetermined that a joint venture to produce rail products andstructural products serving the construction market isfeasible. Bethlehem said the two companies are concludingcertain corporate issues, but still must negotiate with theirunions for concessions.   Another major steelmaker, Armco Inc. reported a widenedthird-period loss of $26.9 million, or 33 cents a share,reflecting weakness at the company's flat-rolled carbon steeljoint venture. In the year-ago third quarter, Armco, which isbased in Parsippany, N.J., posted a loss of $8.8 million, or12 cents a share. Sales in the latest quarter fell 7.3% to$387.6 million from $418.1 million.   Armco said it would shed unprofitable operations andevaluate the carrying value of its insurance companies, whichare to be sold. As a result, it could take future charges ofas much as $350 million. Candidates for possible sale orrestructuring include stainless bar, rod and wire operationsand certain Latin American units.   Meanwhile, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp., which emerged fromChapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in January, reported aprofit of $392,000, or two cents a share, compared withearnings of $22.4 million in the year-earlier period.Year-ago per-share figures weren't available because newshares were issued as part of the reorganization. TheWheeling, W. Va., steelmaker said steel sales prices dropped6.1% and shipments fell 4.6%.   While this has been a difficult year for the entireindustry in terms of weak pricing and demand, Bethlehem'sprofits have been particularly hard-hit by equipment outagecosts, which cost the company $50 million in the quarter, andabout $100 million in the year. Bethlehem completedmodernizations at its Sparrows Point, Md., facility twomonths ago and began relining a Burns Harbor, Ind., blastfurnace in the third quarter.   Bethlehem also had higher operating costs from a new laborpact and a sales shift to lower-profit products because ofincreased shipments of semi-finished steel.   Charles Bradford, an analyst with UBS Securities, believesthe modernization programs should position Bethlehem forsubstantial earnings improvement, but he noted that thecompany still needs to deal with its lackluster bar, rod andwire division. Bethlehem said it needs wage concessions inorder to spend $100 million to upgrade that operation.   Bethlehem said demand from the construction and machinerymarkets continues to be slow. Still, it expects higherfourth-quarter shipments on strengthened orders as customersreplenish inventories and increase production for lightflat-rolled products. The improved order rate in the thirdquarter also helped steelmakers push through a 4% priceincrease effective with Sept. 29 shipments of flat-rolledsteel.</TEXT></DOC>
