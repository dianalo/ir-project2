Proposed action:</T3> The existing Federal responsibility at BayouLafourche from the Gulf of Mexico to mile 13.2 is a 12 by 125-foot channel.The channel was authorized by the River and Harbors Act of 14 July 1960.By resolutions passed by the Committee on Public Works of the U.S. Senateon 21 February 1972, and the Committee on Public Works of the U.S. Houseof Representatives on 14 June 1972, the Corps of Engineers is authorizedto conduct a study to determine the feasibility of modifying the BayouLafourche-Lafourche Jump Waterway, Louisiana, with particular referenceto providing adequate channel dimensions to meet needs of existing andfuture navigation. In 1968 the Greater Lafourche Port Commission enlarged the portion of thechannel from the Gulf of Mexico to Port Fourchon to 20 by 300 feet. Thebar channel and jetty reach was further enlarged by the Port Commissionto 30 by 300 feet in 1980. The Port Commission has requested the Corpsassume maintenance of the channel at the enlarged dimensions and investigatethe feasibility of further channel enlargements. The channel provides access to the Gulf of Mexico for vessels engaged inthe offshore oil and gas industry, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, anda large commercial fishing industry. <T3>Alternatives:</T3> Project alternatives will address Federal involvementin the Bayou Lafourche channel up to Port Fourchon. The feasibility oftaking over responsibility of the channel at dimensions greater than thosecurrently authorized will be investigated. The drafts and other dimensionalrequirements of vessels using the waterway will be used to develop alternativeplans. Under the no-action plan, the Corps would continue to be responsiblefor maintenance of the channel at the authorized dimensions of 12 by 125feet. <T3>Scoping:</T3> The scoping process will include distribution of a scopinginput request to local, state, and Federal agencies, elected officials,local organizations, local news media, affected businesses, and segmentsof the public who may have an interest in the project. The scoping inputrequest will invite comments on project alternatives and other significantproject related issues to be used in the planning process. Comments receivedas a result of the scoping input request will be summarized and a summarywill be sent to all respondents. Discussion of significant issues in theDEIS will encompass the suggestions contained in the replies to the scopinginput request. A scoping meeting will not be held unless written responsesindicate a need for such action. <T3>Significant Issues:</T3> The DEIS will analyze significant issues concerningthe proposed project such as effects to the offshore oil and gas industry,the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, commercial fishing industry, endangeredand threatened species, wildlife and fishery resources, marsh lands, oysterbeds, and cultural and recreational resources. <T3>Environmental Consultation and Review:</T3> The U.S. Fish and WildlifeService will provide a Coordination Act Report. The Corps will work withstate and Federal agencies in attempts to minimize environmental impactswhile using dredge material to rebuild marsh and nourish beaches. <T3>Completion Date:</T3> The DEIS is scheduled to be available to thepublic in April 1990.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 18, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard V.
