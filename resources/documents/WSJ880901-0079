Now it hopes to peddle another rocket to some Japanese businessmen who want to vault the ashes from cremated bodies into orbit.    --Space buffs, praising the wonders of weightlessness, predicted that space-based manufacturing would produce sales of $30 billion a year in the 1990s. Fat chance. Only one product made in space -- tiny globs of paint used to calibrate electron microscopes -- has ever been sold on Earth. Total sales: $200,000.    Space-business devotees predict that someday soon someone will figure out how to make a buck in space, other than by the traditional methods of bouncing phone calls off satellites or building rockets for the government. But until that day comes, space firms turn to Uncle Sam for help. So far, the government has shelled out billions of dollars to prop up space companies.    &quot;It's like the government has to pay ship captains to go out and explore new continents,&quot; says Frank DiBello, a space consultant here. &quot;The government is trapped in a subsidy cycle.&quot; Among the goodies the government doles out are research grants, operating grants, free or cut-rate space-shuttle rides, deferred payments of launch costs, and patent rights on government-subsidized research.    Geostar Corp., a Washington-based firm that tracks trucks and boats by satellite, is adept at building a space business by stroking Washington.    Three years ago, Geostar negotiated a deal to launch a satellite on the space shuttle. It got the government to absorb half the cost and paid back the favor by offering federal agencies discount rates on its tracking service. Geostar says it signed its first government customers before it began operations, and then used those contracts to sew up $23 million in private financing and woo private customers. &quot;You can't put a price tag on what the federal government did for us,&quot; says Michael Breslin, Geostar's senior vice president.    Other times, the government pays directly to pump up space business. This year, Congress approved $76 million to develop a new generation of communications satellites -- part of a $500 million multiyear program -- even though the White House argues that the satellite-communications industry should pay for the work.    To protect themselves against lean times, space businesses look for investors outside the federal government too. Space Services, for instance, was kept afloat for years by a wealthy Houston real-estate developer who is also a space buff and 57 of his friends. Last year, Houston Industries Inc., the local power company, purchased an option to buy a majority stake in the fledgling company.    Playing the space subsidy game can be hazardous. Space Industries Inc., in Houston, wants to build and launch a small space station for materials research before the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's mammoth space station is ready. So last year it went to a House appropriations subcommittee and won a $25 million grant, and then parlayed that into a White House promise for $700 million in funds. But the project has drawn so much criticism from lawmakers who weren't consulted, among others, that the project will be delayed, if not canceled.    NASA's view of space business is decidedly ambivalent. Jon Michael Smith, a NASA space commercialization official, is a rah-rah salesman for space who persuaded Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co. to sign up for 62 experiments over a decade on the space shuttle. But other NASA officials see space commerce as a threat to the agency's hegemony and resist it tenaciously, says Courtney Stadd, until yesterday the Transportation Department's director of commercial space transportation.    Conatec Inc., a Lanham, Md., rocket company, says it quickly won Transportation Department approval to launch commercial payloads. But it has negotiated with NASA for 18 months without persuading the agency to let it use a launch pad. The negotiations are going so slowly, complains Gene Kadar, Conatec's president, that Conatec mightn't get its first rocket off the ground until 1993 -- four years behind schedule.    Pro-business government policies can go awry in odd ways. After the Challenger disaster, the president kicked communications satellites and other commercial cargo off the shuttle, thereby giving birth to a private rocket business. But while the directive delighted big rocket builders, it devastated tiny Orbital Sciences Corp., a Fairfax, Va., company that built a steering rocket to push communications satellites from the shuttle into a higher orbit. The policy &quot;cut our available market in half,&quot; says David Thompson, president of Orbital Sciences, which is redesigning its launcher for unmanned rockets.    Soon, big U.S. rocket companies may be in trouble too. Richard Brackeen, president of Martin Marietta Corp.'s commercial rocket business, says there isn't enough business for the three big U.S. rocket companies -- Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. He adds that at least one of the companies will probably be forced out of the commercial market. Dollar-hungry China and the Soviet Union, meanwhile, are offering cut-rate deals for launches, a bit of capitalism that will only make things worse for the U.S. companies.    Even satellite-communications companies, long the only money-making commercial space ventures, face tough times. Telephone companies are racing to build fiber-optic networks, reducing their need for new satellites. In 1985, for instance, the Federal Communications Commission approved the launch of 26 new domestic communications satellites. But within two years, a Commerce department report says, owners of about 10 of the satellites canceled their launch plans. </TEXT></DOC>
