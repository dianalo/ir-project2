WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul II has beatified MotherKatharine Drexel, praising the Philadelphia-born heiress-turned-nunfor devoting her life and fortune to fighting racism against blacksand American Indians.   About 10,000 people packed St. Peter's Basilica for Sunday'sceremony in which the pope also beatified three Franciscanmissionaries stoned to death in Ethiopia in the early 18th century.   In becoming ``blesseds'' of the Roman Catholic Church, the fourtook a step toward possible sainthood.   Mother Drexel, who was born in in 1858, became a nun in 1891 andfounded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament to work among blacksand Indians. She opened nearly 60 schools and missions, mostly inthe West and Southwest.   A member of a prominent Philadelphia banking family, she gave anestimated $20 million to further her order's work before her deathat age 96 in 1955.   Mother Drexel ``seemed to grasp the fundamental truths which manyof her contemporaries failed to grasp; for example, the truth aboutthe equal dignity and worth of every human being, regardless of raceor ethnic origin,'' the pope said.   ``In her day, American Indians and blacks in the United Statessuffered great injustices as a result of racial prejudice,'' thepope said in English. ``Seeing clearly the evil of this situation,she set out with determination to combat and overcome it.''   John Paul said Mother Drexel focused her efforts on establishingCatholic schools.   He noted that Mother Drexel came to Rome in 1887 to ask Pope LeoXIII to send missionaries to her schools for Indians, and thepontiff persuaded her to become a missionary herself.   Mother Drexel established her first school in 1887: St. CatherineIndian School in Santa Fe, N.M. She opened other schools in Wyoming,Montana, California and Oregon.   The order also set up a Catholic school system to serve blacks in13 states, with 30 convents from Virginia to Louisiana. In 1925,Mother Drexel founded Xavier University in New Orleans, the firstpredominantly black Catholic university in the country.   Archbishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua of Philadelphia said MotherDrexel is remembered for ``her undaunted spirit of courageousinitiative in addressing social inequities among minorities _ 100years before such concern aroused public interest in the UnitedStates.''   Among the more than 1,000 people who traveled from the UnitedStates for the ceremony were Cardinal John Krol of Philadelphia;Sister Juliana Haynes, president of the order; about 200 blackCatholics and dozens of American Indians.   Also present were 22 distant cousins of Mother Drexel, includingthree current trustees at Philadelphia's Drexel University, whichwas founded by her uncle, banker Anthony Joseph Drexel, in 1891.There are no survivors of her immediate family.   The Vatican this year cleared the way for Mother Drexel'sbeatification by approving a miracle attributed to her intercession.Robert J. Gutherman, a Bucks County, Pa., teen-ager who lost hearingin his right ear from an infection, reportedly regained hearing in1974 after his parents prayed for Mother Drexel's intervention.   To become a saint, the Vatican would have to confirm a secondmiracle attributed to her intercession.   The Franciscans beatified were German Liberato Weiss and ItaliansSamuele Marzorati and Michele Pio Faoli. The three were martyred onMarch 3, 1716, outside Gondar in Ethiopia.   The three had been sent to Ethiopia to open ecumenical dialoguewith the Abyssinian church but were condemned for their religiouswork and stoned to death.</TEXT></DOC>
