Few economists see a return anytime soon to the double-digit inflation of the late 1970s. However, the latest surge presents the Fed with the problem of how to head off an inflationary spiral in the face of continued economic sluggishness.    The rise in the Labor Department's producer price index for finished goods, which amounts to an 8.9% compound annual rate, was well above most economists' expectations and reflected sharply higher prices for meat, energy and motor vehicles. It followed an increase of 0.4%, or a 5.5% annual pace, in March.    &quot;We have a dangerous, inflationary process unleashed and building in our economy,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. &quot;It's a process our policy makers can't ignore.&quot;    Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University, said that much of the price acceleration -- particularly for cars and meat -- is likely to be temporary. But he said the report will lead to further price increases by feeding inflationary expectations in the economy.    &quot;We have an inflationary psychology that is starting to feed on itself,&quot; he said. &quot;People are raising prices in the belief that everyone's doing it and we're going to get more inflation because of that.&quot;    The report was particularly ominous, many economists said, because it accompanied a Fed report that cast doubt on whether a significant improvement is at hand in the manufacturing sector. The Fed said that industrial production fell 0.4% in April after falling a revised 0.2% in March. &quot;The combination of reports presents a picture of the worst of all possible worlds for the U.S. economy,&quot; Mr. Sinai said.    While accelerating inflation increases pressure on the Fed to tighten credit, the weakness in industrial output provides a reminder of the risks such a move would entail for the economy. Moreover, the increased inflation comes as interest rates are already rising. Chase Manhattan Bank, for example, increased its prime rate Friday to 8.25% from 8%, and other banks quickly followed. The prime rate is used by banks as a base rate on a wide range of loans to medium-size and small businesses as well as to individuals.    Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co., said the government reports raised the specter of &quot;stagflation,&quot; in which accelerating inflation and high interest rates would choke off the economic recovery.    Mr. Sinai said, &quot;Higher inflation and higher interest rates have always been the combination that brings a recession.&quot;    In its report, the Labor Department said energy prices rose 2.1% in April after falling 0.2% in March. Mr. Dederick said recent oil price increases have begun pushing up the prices of products that require large amounts of energy to produce, such as plastics, synthetic rubber and paints.    He said, too, that domestic prices appear to be rising in response to the decline of the dollar in foreign-exchange trading. The lower dollar has raised import prices, giving domestic producers some opportunity to increase prices, too.    Mr. Ratajczak said the higher motor vehicle prices reflected the end of some discount programs, while the higher meat prices resulted in part from a temporary shortage as farmers tried to build herds. Pork prices spurted 13.1% in April after a 1.1% rise in March, while beef and veal prices were up 8.3% after a 0.2% increase. Overall, food prices rose 1.5% after a 0.5% increase.    Excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile, prices rose 0.3% after a 0.5% rise the month before. Capital equipment prices increased 0.3% after a 0.1% rise.    The department's price index for intermediate goods rose 0.3% in March and April. Prices of crude goods increased a sharp 2.8% in April after a 0.1% rise in March.    The figures in both the price report and the production report are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment, producer prices for finished goods in April rose 0.9% to 295% of their 1967 average and were 2.7% above a year earlier.    The drop in industrial output largely reflected a decline in motor-vehicle production, although the Fed said smaller declines were widespread in the output of other sectors. The output of home goods, for instance, fell for the fourth consecutive month.    &quot;We all knew car production would be down, but this is pretty much across the board,&quot; said Michael Evans, president of Evans Economics here. &quot;I think it's a serious decline.&quot;    The drop in auto output contributed to declines in consumer goods, which fell 0.9% after a 0.4% drop in March, and in business equipment, which fell 0.4% after a 0.8% decline.    Production by manufacturers fell 0.4% in April after a 0.2% drop in March; most of the decline came in big-ticket items. Mining output rose 0.2% after a 0.6% drop. The output of utilities rose 0.3% after a 0.4% rise. Materials production slipped 0.1% in March and April.    The Fed's industrial production index stood at 126.3% of its 1977 average in April, up 1.3% from a year earlier.
