The 106-member platform committee looked for ways to avoid adivisive fight over deployment of the Star Wars anti-missile systemafter finishing with the domestic portion of the 30,000-worddocument Thursday.   But it was Southern Africa that sparked an early fight betweenmore militant committee members and those pushing the views of theBush campaign.   First the committee agreed to denounce South Africa:``Republicans deplore the apartheid system of South Africa andconsider it morally repugnant.''   But then the committee turned back a series of amendmentsdesigned to blame communists for many of the problems in thattroubled region.   For example, Jim Summers of Washington wanted to specify thatall Communist troops should leave Angola, rather than all foreigntroops, the phrase pushed by the Bush forces.   ``If it looks like a Red and talks like a Red ... let's call ita Communist,'' he said.   But Rep. Tom Loeffler of Texas, head of the foreign policysubcommittee, argued against any changes: ``Words are delicate.Written comments cannot be retracted.''   Summers' proposal was rejected as was language offered tocondemn the African National Congress, a key group fighting theSouth African government.   ``It's a communist group,'' said Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan ofCalifornia, the amendment's sponsor.   Loeffler said he agreed with the sentiments, but said any change``can cause problem with respect to the situation in South Africa.''   The Bush forces did accept an amendment opposing ``themaintenance of communist forces in Mozambique.''   Today's session, focused on the 60 pages of defense and foreignpolicy language, began with praise for Republican nominee-to-beBush and criticism of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.   ``There is one person who can fill the full measure of theawesome charge of being president _ George Bush,'' said Rep. TomLoeffler of Texas. ``The grim truth is, Mr. Dukakis, that the OvalOffice is no place for on-the-job training.''   The Oval Office phrase is in the platform itself.   Foreign policy is an area that Bush views as a strength in hisbattle against Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts.   Rep. BIll McCollum of Florida denounced as ``pure politicalhogwash'' rhetoric from Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen thatBush has not been deeply involved in foreign policy.   ``We have a candidate who has been more involved in foreignpolicy ... than anyone who has ever run for president of the UnitedStates,'' McCollum said.   There was a bitter tangle on AIDS on Thursday, but the committeemembers, while dissenting on a variety of issues, chose not todisturb Bush's hopes for a peaceful convention with floor fights onthe platform.   ``I doubt very much that there will be any floor fights,'' saidSen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, co-chairman of committee. ``Themoderates in our party have had a significant impact on the newerissues in the platform.''   Earlier today, GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, interviewed on``CBS This Morning,'' said, ``We're a conservative political party.We're proud of that. We're not afraid of the `c' word.''   Fahrenkopf said, however, the document will reflect Bush's plansfor ``a new direction in education, in environment, in child care.''   ``The vice president came here in an unprecedented event andspoke to this platform committee and tried to give them thatdirection, so that this really will truly be a Bush platform,'' hesaid.   The GOP platform committee will meet again Monday afternoon,after the opening session of the convention, to take a final votebefore the convention faces the issues on Tuesday.   One possible fight today looms over when to deploy PresidentReagan's Star Wars plan, formally called the Strategic DefenseInitiative.   Strong Star Wars backers, led by Angela Buchanan of California,pushed through a change earlier this week to make the platform callfor ``rapid and certain deployment'' of SDI.   But former Sen. John Tower of Texas, a Bush spokesman ondefense, told reporters that the platform would reflect theoriginal draft language, calling for deployment as soon as feasible.   ``I don't think we should begin the program by acting tooprecipitously,'' he said.   Ms. Buchanan vowed a fight at the committee against any changes.   ``My understanding is that the vice president is comfortablewith the language,'' she said.   Most of Thursday's session was peaceful, in sharp contrast tothe heated debates earlier in the week on such topics as abortion.   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut dropped his plans topress an amendment calling upon the GOP to back tough economicsanctions against South Africa. And a possibe floor fight wasaverted over abortion when moderates dropped plans to challenge aplank that says, ``We believe the unborn child has a fundamentalindividual right to life which cannot be infringed.''</TEXT></DOC>
