<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-77-0478 </DOCNO><TEXT>The automatic control of a battery of 15 cells in which the NACE TM-01-77test is performed is described. The gas circuit is fully automated, includingswitching from nitrogen to H/sub 2/S at the beginning of the test andsafety valve actuation in case of hazardous concentration of H/sub 2/Sin the laboratory. The temperature of the cells, samples and elongationsare continuously assessed. This allows a detailed assessment of the waysulphide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC) proceeds. Control of the pollutionof the environment is also important. The system adopted is based ona three stage neutralization associated with an automatic monitoringof the H/sub 2/S concentration in the cells.</TEXT></DOC>
