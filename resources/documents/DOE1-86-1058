Moreoverit is possible to selectively recognize diagnostically interesting regionswith different radioactivity intake, retention and elimination of theradiopharmaceutical and to characterize the metabolic efficiency withthe help of quantitative parameters. /sup 123/I-heptadecanoic acid isconsidered to be suitable for the clinical use in establishing the globaland regional metabolic efficiency of the myocardium, for primary diagnosticsand represents an expressive diagnostic remedy for the assessment ofthe course of myocardial diseases and the success of therapy.</TEXT></DOC>
