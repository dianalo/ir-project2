The first 60 days of compliance with the treaty signed byPresident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev lastDecember ended Monday when the superpowers completed all authorizedinspections.   The so-called baseline inspections were intended to allow eachcountry to verify the number and location of medium-range andshorter range nuclear weapons in each arsenal before theirdestruction begins under the INF treaty.   American inspectors had to visit 133 Soviet weapons facilitiesat 115 locations during the two-month period. The Soviets had toinspect 31 facilities at 26 sites in the United States and WesternEurope.   The treaty, which the Senate ratified earlier this summer, callsfor the elimination within three years of all American and Sovietland-based missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles.   The treaty covers 859 nuclear-armed missiles on the U.S. side,compared with 1,831 on the Soviet side.   Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard refused to discussdetails of the inspections Tuesday but told reporters: ``I have notseen any reports of problems with regard to the baselineinspections.''   ``We completed our baseline inspections and they completedtheirs,'' said Cmdr. Ken Pease, a spokesman for the Pentagon'son-site inspection agency.   ``The Soviets were very flexible, very professional and veryknowledgeable about the treaty, which facilitated ourinspections,'' Pease said. ``Both sides knew the terms of thetreaty and worked in a professional manner together.''   Under the treaty, both sides next will be entitled to conduct 20short-notice inspections over the next year at selected militaryfacilities.   In addition, permanent inspection teams are on duty at Sovietand American missile plants to guard against cheating, andinspectors from both countries will be able to observe the actualdestruction of missiles.   The Soviets are now operating ``elimination'' _ or destruction _programs for missiles and launchers at five different sites, Peasesaid. In addition, the Russians plan within the next week or two tobegin destroying up to 100 SS-20 missiles by launching them withouttheir warheads.   The United States will begin destroying the medium-rangemissiles in its arsenal on Sept. 8 by firing some solid-fuelrockets used in Pershing II missiles at the Longhorn ArmyAmmunition Plant near Marshall, Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
