Proper venting of these gases from the condenseris critical to prevent poor condenser performance. This paper describesthe testing of the internal gas removal design and the associated ventingequipment of the surface condenser at Pacific Gas and Electric Company'sGeysers Unit 15 Power Plant. Findings indicate that the gases are notbeing properly vented, resulting in a large area of gas blanketed tubes.In this gas blanketed region, the heat transfer is severely reduced sothat this tube surface is no longer functioning to condense steam. Theultimate result of this gas blanketing is to reduce the performance ofthe condenser below the level which would be expected in the absenceof this high noncondensible gas load. 15 references, 14 figures, 4 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
