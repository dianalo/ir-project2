But the survey, conducted in January and early February,also found that businesses weren't spending as much on plantand equipment in the first quarter as they had been planningto spend just three months earlier.</LP><TEXT>   Businesses plan to spend $546.4 billion on plant andequipment in 1991, the department said. But companies saidthey planned to spend at a seasonally adjusted rate of$540.82 billion in the first quarter, substantially less thanthe $557.9 billion rate they projected in the earlier survey,but still 2.2% more than the 1990 fourth-quarter pace.Capital spending dropped by 1.1% in the fourth quarter and by0.1% in the third quarter of last year, the department said.   After adjusting for projected price changes, thedepartment estimated that capital spending will increase 3.2%in 1991, the smallest increase since the decline of 3.1%reported for 1986. Adjusted for price changes, capitalspending in 1990 increased by 4.5%, the department said. TheCommerce Department projects that plant and equipment priceswill actually decline by 0.7% in 1991; previously, itprojected a 2% increase.   Manufacturers, who account for about a third of allcapital spending, plan a 0.3% increase in spending for 1991following a 4.9% increase in 1990, before adjusting for pricechanges. But many manufacturing industries -- including theauto and paper industries -- plan to spend less this yearthan they did in 1990. Businesses outside of manufacturingplan a 3.8% increase in 1991, following a 3.4% increase in1990.
