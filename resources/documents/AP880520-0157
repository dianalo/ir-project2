She told the newspaper that prisoners could fight off ``abreakdown'' for five years at the most, but ``then the organismcatastrophically weakens'' and prisoners seek solace in smoking,lesbianism and narcotics.   Kutsyenkova said the prisoner ``experiences an atrophy of willand initiative, a growing of uncontrollable rage.''   The article was one of the first about conditions in camps forwomen prisoners. Conditions at the country's notorious penalcolonies and labor camps for men, described in the books of exileAlexander Solzhenitsyn, were once taboo subjects for the Sovietmedia. But Kremlin chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of opendiscussion of the country's problems has produced several reportsexposing deficiencies in the criminal justice system.   The article described conditions at Corrective Labor WomensColony No. 65-15 in Kuybyshev, 620 miles southeast of Moscow on theVolga River.   The man in charge of the prisons, Alexander V. Vlasov,acknowledged in a commentary accompanying the article thatimprovements are needed.   ``Quite a few problems have piled up in the system of correctivelabor institutions,'' wrote Vlasov, minister of internal affairs.``Perestroika is needed also in this sphere in which the humanfactor should be made predominant too.''   Perestroika is Gorbachev's term for his administrative andeconomic overhaul of Soviet society.   The article said punishment of prisoners is oftencounterproductive, causing them to get into more trouble ratherthan lead them to rehabilitation.   Kutsyenkova said some inmates don't want to be freed becausethey have no families left outside after serving long prison terms.Two freed prisoners slept several nights outside the colony gate,``praying to be taken back into the colony'' because they couldn'tlive on their own, the article said.   The article did not say why Kutsyenkova had been jailed but saidthe colony's inmates had murdered husbands and children, takenbribes or engaged in other forms of corruption. Among the inmateswere a director of a large store, senior lecturers at colleges, achief bookkeeper and an engineer-economist, Sovietskaya Rossiyasaid.   Prisoners are forced to work shifts as long as 10-12 hours insewing shops with poor ventilation, the article said.   Punishment of 10-15 days in an isolation cell is meted out forsuch things as going out without a shawl, loudly saying goodnightto cellmates and smoking in a prohibited area, the newspaper said.   Vlasov said his ministry is trying to improve the quality of itspersonnel at the colonies and labor camps. New criminal andcorrective labor codes are being drafted to make the punishmentmore appropriately fit a convict's crime and to provide for areduction of sentences in some cases.   An experiment is planned in which prisoners will be releasedearly for good work and good behavior.   He did not specifically address the problems of lesbianism anddrug addiction among the women prisoners.   In May, the Tass news agency carried a report saying life in onecamp outside Moscow is hard but that prisoners are treated fairlyand given free time and an opportunity to get an education.   Soviet officials say the camps are designed to make inmates takea conscientious attitude toward work and teach them to abide by thelaw. Western organizations estimate the camps hold 1 million people.</TEXT></DOC>
