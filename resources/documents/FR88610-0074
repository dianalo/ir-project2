Any resulting awards willbe made under the Steel Initiative Program, the goal of which is the developmentof new technologies that increase significantly the energy efficiency andoverall productivity of processes that produce steel. Technologies of interestare those which improve the competitiveness of the U.S. steel industrythrough reduction, elimination, or replacement of entire unit operations.Incremental improvements to existing operations are neither sought norencouraged. Unsolicited proposals will be evaluated for technical merit,the concept's applicability to the U.S. domestic steel industry, industry'scommitment to the project as evidenced by the cost sharing proposed (amount,type, and source), the appropriateness of the proposed project structureas shown in the Statement of Work and the management plan, and the researchcapabilities and qualifications of the proposer(s). DOE will select onlyproposals which are meritorious, based on the above evaluation, and whichrepresent a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach.This notice does not commit the Government to make an award. A decisionto award will be determined through evaluation of proposals received andthe availability of funds.Industrial concerns or partnerships, including partnerships between industryand National Laboratories, universities, and non-profit organizations,are encouraged to submit unsolicited proposals.Proposals must contain the following information: (1) A description ofthe proposed research; (2) a critical review of existing and emerging technologieson a worldwide basis that are or could be competitive with the proposedtechnology, which concludes that the proposed research is timely, doesnot duplicate work being pursued elsewhere, and is significantly more competitive(in terms of potential product value improvement) than existing or emergingtechnology; (3) an economic evaluation indicating the potential for atleast a 10% improvement in product value due to a reduction in manufacturingcosts and improvement in product characteristics, and an estimate of economicbenefit to the overall U.S. steel industry; (4) an estimate of the potentialenergy savings attributable to the implementation of the proposed technology;(5) a Management Plan including a Statement of Work, project schedule,work breakdown structure, task assignments, spending plan, milestones,and decision points; (6) industry cost-sharing commitments, by Phase, anda description of the form of cost-sharing (cash, in-kind, etc.); SteelInitiative legislation requires that total cost-sharing must be at least30 percent of the funding provided by DOE; (7) an estimate of the totalRandamp;D costs required to reach the stage of technology development atwhich Government funding will no longer be required, including a breakdownby type of cost and by task for the required federal funds and total manpowerbreakdown by task; (8) evidence and a schedule showing that the proposedtechnology has the potential for commercialization within ten years; and(9) the qualifications and capabilities of the proposing organization(s)and individuals responsible for performing the work. Additional informationmay be subsequently requested by DOE during review of submitted proposals.Standard Form (SF) 424 and DOE Form 1600.5, ``Assurance of Compliance'',must be executed prior to any award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Address:</T2> Each unsolicited proposal submitted must be physicallyseparate from any other proposals submitted. Five (5) copies of each proposal,including the signed original, should be submitted to: U.S. Departmentof Energy, Office of Industrial Programs, CE-142, Room 5F-034, 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. Attn: Mr. W.E. Eckhart, Program Manager.Questions relating to this NPI should be directed to the above addressor to Mr. Eckhart, at (202) 586-8668. Proposers should become familiarwith the Steel Initiative Management Plan, which may be obtained from Mr.Eckhart.DOE reserves the right to support or not support any or all proposals.DOE assumes no responsibility for any costs associated with proposal preparation.Detailed information concerning assistance policy and procedures is containedin the Department of Energy Assistance Regulations, 10 CFR Part 600, copiesof which are available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. GovernmentPrinting Office, Washington, DC 20402.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Dates:</T2> This notice is effective until May 1, 1989.
