If Mrs. Thatcher's party wins reelection Thursday, it will undertake a denationalization program that promises to dwarf all previous operations.    The Tories intend to sell most of Britain's giant water and electricity utilities, valued at as much as #24 billion. But if the sell-off would be the biggest to date, it also is likely to be the most difficult. Disputes with management about breaking up the businesses could provoke embarrassing political fights. Even with management's cooperation, the complexity and sheer size of the industries would make it difficult to restructure them for sale.    Conservatives &quot;have left the most difficult sales until last,&quot; says Michael Osborne, an economist at the British banking group Kleinwort Benson Lonsdale PLC.    The Labor Party and the Alliance of the Social Democratic and Liberal parties have said that they won't denationalize the utilities if they beat the Conservative Party. The Tories, however, would need the money from the sales to cut taxes further and meet their target of an additional #15 billion in denationalizations by 1990.    Analysts value the 10 water authorities in England and Wales, which both provide water and treat sewage, at about #6 billion altogether. The electric utilities get a price tag of as much as #18 billion from some analysts.    By comparison, British Gas PLC has been the world's largest public offering to date; the government floated it on the stock market in December for #5.6 billion.    (Under a previously announced sale, the Conservatives also plan to sell to the public later this year BAA PLC -- which runs Heathrow, Gatwick and several other airports -- for an estimated #1.3 billion.)    Denationalizing the water and electric industries likely would pose problems that the Tories didn't encounter in earlier sales of more traditional government-owned businesses, such as British Airways PLC, or even a utility such as British Gas.    A fight already is shaping up between the Conservatives and some water authorities' top management. The government abruptly postponed initial plans to denationalize the utilities last summer. Then last month, the Conservatives said denationalization of the 10 authorities would involve a transfer of some regulatory functions to a new publicly controlled National Rivers Authority.    Complaints by environmental and industry groups prompted the altered proposal. Among other things, these critics said, it wouldn't have been right for privately owned authorities to treat sewage and oversee pollution regulation.    Water authorities disagree. They say taking away their primary responsibility for river management would gut the business and hurt marketing of their services world-wide -- one rationale for denationalization. After denationalization, &quot;we must have some regulation, but we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,&quot; says Roy Watts, chairman of Thames Water, the largest authority.    Authority managers also were miffed that government officials didn't consult them about the latest plan. &quot;The first I saw of this was when it appeared in the Tory Manifesto,&quot; the party's platform, says Gordon Jones, chairman of both the Yorkshire Water Authority and the Water Authorities Association, a trade group.    Battle lines could be drawn sharply if the Conservatives introduce a water denationalization bill late next year. Tory Environment Minister Nicholas Ridley last month characterized the current water authorities as &quot;both poachers and gamekeepers.&quot; Retorts Mr. Jones of Yorkshire Water: &quot;If the government is suggesting anything disadvantageous to our customers, employees or future shareholders, we'll have to take a strong adversarial line.&quot; But, he emphasizes, specific negotiations haven't begun.    Even if the government gains management's support, selling the water businesses to investors may prove difficult. Some water authorities have a strong balance sheet, but the 10 bear a total long-term debt burden of about #5 billion.    &quot;It isn't certain these companies would generate sufficient profits to service their debt, undertake necessary capital expenditures and pay an adequate dividend to shareholders,&quot; says Robert Miller-Bakewell, an analyst at the brokerage Wood Mackenzie andamp; Co., a Hill Samuel andamp; Co. unit.    The government-owned electricity industry also could be hard to restructure before denationalization. The industry both generates electricity -- at coal and nuclear power plants -- and distributes it. With net assets of #36 billion, it is one of the world's largest monopolies.    The government failed in attempts to boost competition by breaking up British Gas and British Telecommunications PLC before denationalizing them. The Tories needed support from managers who opposed dismemberment of their empires, and restructuring would have slowed things down. The government also knew a monopoly would fetch a higher price. It sold both businesses almost intact.    A reelected Conservative government with a slim parliamentary majority again might lack the resolve -- or the votes -- to attempt restructuring. &quot;The smaller the majority, the more complicated it will be to get a messy piece of legislation like this through the House of Commons,&quot; says Mr. Osborne of Kleinwort Benson.    A successfully denationalized electricity industry would present political problems, too. Its likely freedom to buy cheap foreign coal could decimate the fragile recovery of Britain's coal industry. &quot;Most of the losses of the coal industry now show up in the electricity industry's accounts,&quot; says Dieter Helm, who recently wrote a report on the electricity industry for the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a private London research group. State-owned British Coal &quot;isn't near the break-even point because it's selling artificially expensive coal,&quot; he adds.    Government leaders won't comment before the election about possible problems in selling the water authorities or the electricity industry. But it's clear they remain confident that they will once again confound denationalization skeptics.    &quot;We are not, at this stage, in the business of looking for things that we cannot privatize,&quot; Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said at a news conference last week. &quot;We are in the business of looking for things that we can.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
