Scope of This Program AnnouncementThis program announcement solicits applications and describes the applicationprocess for Basic Center grants under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program.These grants will be competitively awarded during the third and fourthquarters of FY 1989. Project periods for grants will be three years.B. Legislative AuthorityGrants under this program are authorized by the Runaway and Homeless YouthAct (the Act), 42 U.S.C. 5701 <T3>et seq.</T3> This Act was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justiceand Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-415), as amended bythe Juvenile Justice Amendments of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-115), the JuvenileJustice Amendments of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-509), the Juvenile Justice Amendmentsof 1984 (Pub. L. 98-473), and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L.100-690).C. Program PurposeThe purpose of the National Runaway and Homeless Youth Program is to providefinancial assistance to establish or strengthen community-based centersthat address the immediate needs (e.g., outreach, temporary shelter, counseling,and aftercare services) of runaway and homeless youth and their families.``Runaway Youth'' means a person under 18 years of age who absents himselfor herself from home or place of legal residence without the permissionof parents or legal guardians (45 CFR 1351.1(1)).``Homeless Youth'' means a person under 18 years of ago who is in needof services and without a place of shelter where he or she receives supervisionand care (45 CFR 1351.1(f)).Programs receiving Runaway and Homeless Youth Act funding under this announcementare required to adhere to the requirements of 45 CFR Part 1351, the RunawayYouth Program Regulations. Applicants must develop their applications inaccordance with those regulations and the review criteria which are includedin this announcement.D. Program Goals and ObjectivesThe program goals and objectives of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Actare to assist runaway and homeless youth centers to: (1) Alleviate theproblems of runaway and homeless youth, (2) reunite youth with their familiesand encourage the resolution of intrafamily problems through counselingand other services, (3) strengthen family relationships and encourage stableliving conditions for youth, and (4) help youth decide upon constructivecourses of action.E. Non-Discrimination in ServicesAll services under this program, including temporary shelter, must be providedin accordance with 45 CFR Parts 80, 81, and 84 pertaining to non-discriminationunder programs receiving Federal assistance.F. Available Funds for Basic CentersIn FY 1989, the Administration for Children, Youth and Families expectsto award approximately $24,230,700 in Basic Center grants. This total willbe divided among the States according to their respective populations underthe age of 18, with the condition that the amount allotted to each Stateshall be not less than $75,000, and that the amounts allotted to the VirginIslands, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be not lessthan $30,000 each. The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are consideredStates, and therefore shall be allotted not less than $75,000.Of this amount, $14,178,464 will be awarded in the form of <T3>non-competing continuations</T3> to current Basic Center grantees havingone or two years remaining in their project periods. Grantees in this categorywill receive instructions from their respective OHDS Regional Offices onthe procedures for applying for these continuation grants. These grantees,which are listed in Appendix G with expiration dates of 1990 or 1991, should<T3>not</T3> apply for funds under this <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcement.Approximately $10,052,236 will be awarded under this announcement in theform of <T3>new competitive</T3> grants according to the procedures outlined inthis announcement.Approximately 134 new competitive Basic Center grants are expected to beawarded. Award recipients may include current grantees having project periodsending by September 30, 1989 and new applicants. New Basic Center grant awards will be made from late June 1989 throughthe end of September 1989. All grant applicants should request three-year project periods (StandardForm 424A (Rev. 4-88), Budget Information, Section E). While the projectperiods assigned to successful applicants will be for three years, theinitial awards of grant funds will have budget periods of only one year.Subsequent awards of funds will depend upon satisfactory performance bythe grantee and on the availability of appropriated funds. Funding recommendations for the new competitive Basic Center applicationswill be based primarily on the scores assigned to the applications by thenon-Federal reviewers who will evaluate each application according to thecriteria described in Part IV, Section B, below, and on input from ACYFstaff. Final decisions will be made by the Commissioner of ACYF. The number of new Basic Center grants awarded within each State will dependupon the State's allocation for new grants and on the number of acceptableapplications. All applications under this announcement will compete withother applicants in the State in which their services will be provided.In the event that an insufficient number of applications meeting the minimumcriteria for funding is submitted from any State or jurisdiction, the Commissioner,ACYF, may reallocate any unused funds. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act requires that the grantee provide anon-Federal match that equals at least 10 percent of the Federal fundsrequested under this announcement (for details see below: Part III, SectionH, ``Grantee Share of the Project''). Section 366(a)(2) of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act requires that notless than 90 percent of the funds appropriated for a fiscal year shallbe available for support of local runaway and homeless youth centers. Thefollowing Table, which reflects this requirement, indicates the FY 1989allocations for each State. In this Table, the amount shown in the columnlabeled ``New Awards'' is the amount available for competition in eachState in FY 1989.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Runaway and Homeless Youth Centers, Table

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, the Departmentis required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview and approval any reporting and record keeping requirements in regulationsincluding program announcements. This program announcement does not containinformation collection requirements beyond those approved for OHDS grantapplications by OMB.E. Notification Under Executive Order 12372This program is covered under Executive Order (E.O.) 12372, ``IntergovernmentalReview of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR Part 100, ``IntergovernmentalReview of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.''Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing andcommenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs.All States and Territories except Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska,American Samoa and Palau have elected to participate in the Executive Orderprocess and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicantsfrom these seven jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372.Applications for projects to be administered by Federally-recognized IndianTribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise,applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert themof the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions.Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as early as possibleso that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as partof the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all requiredmaterials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal(or date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424,item 16a. Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadlinedate to comment on proposed new or competing continuation awards. Therefore,the comment period for State processes will end on July 10, 1989, to allowtime for HDS to review, consider and attempt to accommodate SPOC input.SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsementsas official recommentations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearlydifferentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State processrecommendations which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain''rule. When comments are submitted directly to HDS, they should be addressed to:Department of Health and Human Services, HDS/Grants and Contracts ManagementDivision, 200 Independence Avenue, SW., Room 345-F, Hubert H.

Application Consideration All applications which are complete and conform to the requirements ofthis program announcement will be subject to a competitive review and evaluationprocess against the specific criteria outlined below. This review willbe conducted in Washington, D.C. by teams of non-Federal experts knowledgeablein the areas of youth development and/or human service programs. Theseexperts will review applications to determined that applicants will conformto the requirements of the Act (see Part II of this announcement) and theProgram Performance Standards by applying the criteria presented in PartIV, Section B, and assigning a score to each application. To avoid conflictof interest, the non-Federal reviewers will be from States other than theone from which applications are being reviewed. The results of the competitivereview will be analyzed by Federal staff and taken into consideration bythe Associate Commissioner of the Family and Youth Service Bureau who,in consultation with OHDS Regional officials, will recommend to the Commissionerthe projects to be funded. The ACYF Commissioner will make the final selection of the applicants tobe funded. In the interest of effective geographic distribution of thebasic center grants, the Commissioner may show preference for applicationsproposing services in areas that would not otherwise be served. The Commissionermay elect not to fund any applicants that have known management, fiscalor other problems or situations which make it unlikely that they wouldbe able to provide effective services. Successful applicants will be notified through the issuance of a FinancialAssistance Award which sets forth the amount of fund granted, the termsand conditions of the grant, the effective date of the grant, the budgetperiod for which support is given, the non-Federal share to be provided,and the total project period for which support is contemplated. Organizationswhose applications have been disapproved will be notified in writing ofthat decision.H. Grantee Share of the Project The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act requires that the grantee provide anon-Federal match that equals at least 10 percent of the Federal fundsawarded under this announcement.

Program Performance Standards<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Overview</ITAG>The program performance standards established by the Family and Youth ServicesBureau for its funded centers relate to the methods and processes by whichthe needs of runaway and homeless youth and their families are being met,as opposed to the outcome of the services provided on the clients served.The program performance standards, and the related criteria and indicators,as initially published in March 1977, were developed by the Bureau througha functional analysis of the service and administrative components of therunaway youth projects, and were revised based upon the contents and feedbackprovided by the FY 1975 funded projects; they have subsequently been furtherrevised, based upon the experience of the Bureau and its funded centersin their implementation. The standards relate to the basic program componentsenumerated in section 317 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and asfurther detailed in the Regulations and Program Guidance governing theimplementation of the Act. The program performance standards are the general principles against whicha judgment can be made to determine whether a service or an administrativecomponent of a basic center has achieved a particular level of attainment.Fourteen program performance standards, with related criteria, are establishedby the Bureau for the projects funded under the Runaway and Homeless YouthAct. Nine of these standards relate to service components (outreach, individualintake process, temporary shelter, individual and group counseling, familycounseling, service linkages, aftercare services, recreational programs,and case disposition), and five to administrative functions or activities(staffing and staff development, youth participation, individual clientfiles, ongoing project planning, and board of directors/advisory body).Although fiscal management is not included as a program performance standard,it is viewed by FYSB as being an essential element in the operation ofits funded projects. Therefore, as validation visits are made, the regionalACYF specialist and/or staff from the Office of Fiscal Operations willalso review the project's financial management activities. FYSB views these program performance standards as constituting the minimumstandards to which its funded projects should conform. The primary assumptionunderlying the program performance standards is that the service and administrativecomponents which are encompassed within these standards are integral (butnot sufficient in themselves) to a program of services which effectivelyaddresses the crisis and long-term needs of runaway and homeless youthand their families. The program performance standards (and the Program Performance StandardsSelf-Assessment Instrument) are designed to serve as a developmental tool,and are to be employed by both the project staff and the regional ACYFstaff specialists in identifying those service and administrative componentsand activities of individual projects which require strengthening and/ordevelopment either through internal action on the part of staff or throughthe provision of external technical assistance.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. </ITAG><T3>Program Performance Standards and Criteria </T3>The following constitute the program performance standards and criteriaestablished by the Bureau for its funded centers. Each standard is numbered,and each criterion is listed after a lower case letter. <T3>1. Outreach. </T3>The project shall conduct outreach efforts directedtowards community agencies, youth, and parents. <T3>2. Individual Intake Process. </T3>The project shall conduct an individualintake process with each youth seeking services from the project. The individualintake process shall provide for: a. Direct access to project services on a 24-hour basis. b. The identification of the emergency service needs of each youth andthe provision of the appropriate services either directly or through referralsto community agencies and individuals. c. An explanation of the services which are available and the requirementsfor participation, and the securing of a voluntary commitment from eachyouth to participate in project services prior to admitting the youth intothe project. d. The recording of basic background information on each youth admittedinto the project. e. The assignment of primary responsibility to one staff member for coordinatingthe services provided to each youth. f.

National Runaway Switchboard The National Runaway Switchboard/National Communication System is a confidentialtelephone information, referral and crisis counseling service to runawayand otherwise homeless youth and their families in the United States, includingAlaska and Hawaii. It is also a technical resource to assist youth-servingagencies in delivering more effective services by facilitating communicationamong service providers about specific cases. In essence, the NationalCommunications System is designed to provide a neutral and available channelof communication between runaway and homeless youth and their familiesand to refer runaway and otherwise homeless youth and their families tothe appropriate agency for assistance with their immediate crisis as wellas working toward resolving their long-term problems. The National RunawaySwitchboard (NRS) has become a major conduit for the reunification of runawayyouth and their families. Also for over the past three years, the NRS hasserved as the National Youth Suicide Hotline, providing crisis interventioncounseling and referral services to youth and their families. The significant reasons for the development of the NRS are: (1) The interstatenature of the runaway and homeless youth problem, and (2) the increasedvulnerability of youth to various forms of exploitation when they are awayfrom home and/or in unfamiliar environments. Approximately 2.26 million youth have been served by NRS from 1975 to thepresent. The current grant to operate NRS is held by Metro Help, Inc.,3080 N.
