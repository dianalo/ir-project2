Introduction </ITAG>On August 1, 1986, the International Securities Clearing Corporation (``ISCC'')filed with the Commission an application under Section 17A of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\<NOTE/> for registration as a clearing agency. On August 14, 1986,the Commission published notice of the application in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to solicit comments from interested persons.\2\<NOTE/> No comments were received. ISCC amended its application onseveral occasions, most recently on March 30, 1989, when ISCC requestedan exemption from section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act.\3\<NOTE/> No comments on the amendments were received. This Order approvesISCC's application for registration as a clearing agency for a period of18 months and exempts ISCC from Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act for 18months.\4\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(a) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23514 (August 6, 1986),51 FR 29184 (August 14, 1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25594 (April 15, 1988),53 FR 13210 (April 21, 1988) and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26682(March 31, 1989), 54 FR 14180 (April 7, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Section 17A(b)(1) of the Act states that the ``Commission,by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon application, may conditionallyor unconditionally exempt any clearing agency * * * from any provisionsof this section or the rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commissionfinds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protectionof investors, and the purposes of this section, including the prompt andaccurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguardingof securities and funds.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Overview </ITAG>ISCC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Securities Clearing Corporation(``NSCC''), a registered clearing agency.\5\<NOTE/> NSCC formed ISCC to develop international clearance and settlementlinks with foreign financial institutions. ISCC was incorporated underthe laws of New York in November 1985.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ For a discussion of NSCC as a registered clearing agency,<T3>see</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20221 (September 23, 1983),48 FR 45167 (October 3, 1983) (``Full Registration Order'').ISCC will offer services to three types of users: members, foreign financialinstitutions, and limited purpose participants. Members of ISCC generallyinclude U.S. banks and broker-dealers that meet ISCC's membership standards.\6\<NOTE/> ISCC intends to link with non-U.S. clearing entities, orforeign financial institutions, so that ISCC members may obtain the benefitsof the non-U.S. entity's comparison, clearance, settlement, and custodialservices without becoming direct members of that entity. ISCC also intendsto enter into link agreements with foreign financial institutions \7\<NOTE/> that generally would enable foreign financial institutionsto obtain for their members the services of the U.S. national clearanceand settlement system. Members and foreign financial institutions collectivelyare known as participants. ISCC also will offer certain services that donot involve settlement obligations, such as the International Document/SecuritiesExchange Service, to users that qualify as Limited Purpose Participants.\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>infra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ ISCC Rule 40. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The International Document/Securities Exchange Serviceessentially is a courier service. <T3>See</T3> ISCC Rule 31. Limited Purpose Participants' obligations areset out in ISCC Rules 3 and 25, generally.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Statutory Standards </ITAG>With certain exceptions not applicable here, section 17A of the Act requiresa clearing agency, as defined in section 3(a)(23) of the Act, to registerwith the Commission.\9\<NOTE/> ISCC, through its linkage agreements with foreign financialinstitutions to facilitate the clearance and settlement of internationaltrades, falls within the section 3(a)(23) definition of a clearing agencyand therefore is required to register with the Commission.\10\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The term ``clearing agency'' is defined, in pertinentpart, as ``any person who acts as an intermediary in making payments ordeliveries or both in connection with transactions in securities or whoprovides facilities for comparison of data respecting the terms of settlementof securities transactions, to reduce the number of settlements of securitiestransactions, or for the allocation of securities settlement responsibilities.''See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ The staff of the Commission has issued no-action lettersto ISCC enabling ISCC to enter into link agreements with four non-U.S.clearing entities. <T3>See infra</T3> note 13. Subparagraphs (A) through (I) of section 17A(b)(3) of the Act set forthspecific determinations the Commission must make in granting registration.The Commission has published clearing agency registration standards (``Standards'')that provide additional guidelines concerning the Division of Market Regulation's(``Division'') interpretation of subparagraphs (A) through (I).\11\<NOTE/> Specific references to the Standards appear below in applicablesections of the Commission's discussion.\12\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June 17, 1980),45 FR 41920 (June 23, 1980) (``Standards Release''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The Commission notes that the Standards were developedin the context of registration of ten clearing agencies engaged primarilyin clearing domestic corporate debt and equity securities and to a lesserextent, municipal securities. The Commission recognizes that some of theStandards may not be appropriate for a clearing organization providingaccess to clearance and settlement systems for international trades. Accordingly,the Commission intends to apply the Division Standards flexibly and ona case-by-case basis. In addition, the Standards allow clearing agenciesto submit reasons why a particular Standard may be inappropriate and tosuggest alternatives that are consistent with the Act.Section 17A(b)(1) and Rule 17Ab2-1(c) permit the Commission to grant aclearing agency temporary registration and exempt the registrant from oneor more of the requirements    under subparagraphs (A) through (I) of section17A(b)(3). As noted above, the Commission is granting ISCC registrationas a clearing agency for a period of 18 months, with conditional approvalof an exemption from section 17A(b)(3)(C). During the temporary registrationperiod, the applicant is, for all purposes under the Act, a registeredclearing agency.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion </ITAG>A. Scope of this Order This order approves the temporary registration of ISCC as a clearing agencyunder section 17A of the Act for a period not to exceed 18 months. Thedeterminations made today reflect a review of ISCC's by-laws and rulesand all aspects of ISCC's operations detailed in its application.\13\<NOTE/> The determinations also reflect discussions among Commissionstaff, ISCC, and ISCC participants. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ ISCC has obtained permission through no-action lettersfrom Division staff to operate several links. Although those links arenot within the scope of this order, this order will refer to those linksto evaluate ISCC's operational capacity. The four links currently subjectto no-action positions are: (1) an outbound link with the InternationalStock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (``ISE'')(letter from Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation,to Karen Saperstein, Associate General Counsel, ISCC, dated September 10,1986; and letter from Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, Division ofMarket Regulation, to Robert J. Woldow, General Counsel, ISCC, dated December10, 1986); (2) an outbound link for the transmission of data to the Centralede Livraison de Valeurs Mobilieres (``CEDEL'') (letter from Jonathan Kallman,Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, to Karen Saperstein,Associate General Counsel, ISCC, dated September 13, 1988); (3) an inboundlink for custody services with the Central Depository (Pte) Ltd. (``CDP''),a subsidiary of the Stock Exchange of Singapore, (letter from JonathanKallman, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, to Karen Saperstein,Associate General Counsel, ISCC, dated March 23, l988); and (4) an inboundcustody link with Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (``JSCC'') (letterfrom Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation,to Karen Saperstein, Associate General Counsel, ISCC, dated September 20,1988). The Commission expects to review its determinations within 18 months toconsider whether to grant ISCC full registration as a clearing agency.During that time the Commission will monitor and oversee ISCC operationsthrough review of proposed  linkage agreements, rule changes under Section19(b) of the Act,\14\<NOTE/> notices to members,\15\<NOTE/> and disciplinary filings.\16\<NOTE/> The Commission staff also plans to inspect ISCC's facilities.Also, during the 18 month period, the Commission intends to monitor whetherthe exemption from section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act continues to be appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ In the past, the Commission staff has used no-actionpositions to permit ISCC to operate various linkages. The no-action letterarrangement is flexible in that it enables participants to achieve thebenefits of links and allows the Commission to review the links' operationsand the safeguards surrounding those operations. Now that ISCC has becomea registered clearing agency pursuant to this order, the Commission believesISCC should implement any further proposed linkages, beyond those linkagescurrently the subject of no-action requests, as proposed rule changes inaccordance with section 19(b) of the Act. In this regard, the Act requiresself-regulatory organizations, such as ISCC, to file with the Commissionall proposed rule changes for review to determine whether such proposalscomply with the Act. The Act also provides an opportunity for public commentto ensure that the proposal's effect on participants and the markets isfully considered before such proposals are approved or disapproved. IfISCC wishes to vary any of the factual circumstances upon which the Commission'sno-action responses were based, ISCC should submit rule change proposalsin accordance with section 19(b). Moreover, ISCC should submit furtherrequests to authorize new links in accordance with section l9(b) of theAct. Nevertheless, to the extent ISCC's previous no-action requests weredesigned to permit foreign financial institutions to participate in suchlinks, such entities should continue to request no-action positions inorder to participate in such links. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Rule 17a-22 under the Act, 17 CFR 240.17a-22, requiresthat a registered clearing agency file with the Commission, within tendays of release, three copies of any material including manuals, notices,circulars, bulletins, lists or periodicals issued or generally made availableto its participants or to other entities with whom it has a significantrelationship. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See</T3> Section 19(d) of the Act. B. Capacity to Facilitate Promptand Accurate Clearance and Settlement Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act provides that a clearing agency shall notbe registered unless the Commission determines, among other things, thatthe clearing agency has the capacity to facilitate the prompt and accurateclearance and settlement of securities transactions for which it is responsible.ISCC's rules, as the basic framework for the development of internationalclearance and settlement mechanisms through link agreements, are designedto facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of internationaltransactions between U.S. and non-U.S. market participants. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Need for Centralized Clearance and Settlement Facilities for InternationalSecurities Transactions </ITAG>During the last ten years the world's securities markets have become increasinglylinked, as regulatory barriers to participation in foreign markets aresteadily being lowered, increasing investors' ability to participate ininternational trading.\17\<NOTE/> U.S. participation in international trading is significant.In 1987, foreign activity in U.S. stocks totalled approximately $482 billion,an increase from approximately $278 billion in 1986. U.S. purchases andsales in foreign stocks totalled approximately $189 billion in 1987, anincrease from approximately $100 billion in 1986. During the first sixmonths of l988 foreign activity in U.S. stocks was approximately $384 billionand U.S. activity in foreign stocks was approximately $142 billion.\18\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>See</T3> Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break</T3> (February 1988) at 11-1 (``MarketBreak Study''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Office of the Secretary, United States Department ofthe Treasury, <T3>Treasury Bulletin</T3> (various issues). The 1988 data is estimatedat the annual rate, not seasonally adjusted. There are now nearly 500 companies whose shares are listed and traded outsidetheir home countries.\19\<NOTE/> For example, trading in Canadian shares in the United Statesis very active.\20\<NOTE/> Additionally, a recent estimate indicated that about 80%of trading in Swedish shares and more than 20% of trading in French sharesmay occur on the ISE.\21\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>See</T3> Bennett andamp; Kelleher, The International Transmission ofStock Price Disruption in October l987, <T3>Fed. Res. Bank of N.Y. Qly. Rev.</T3> 21 (Summer 1988).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>See</T3> Division of Market Regulation, <T3>lnternationalization Report,</T3> dated July 27, 1987. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> remarks of Robert D. Meyjes, Senior Vice President,Citicorp Investment Bank, at the SEC's Internationalization Roundtable.International trading must be supported by efficient cross-border clearanceand settlement mechanisms. This view repeatedly has been voiced by marketparticipants. For example, participants at the Commission's 1987 Roundtableon the Internationalization of the Securities Markets agreed that the needfor improved international clearance and settlement is the critical issueif internationalization of the world's securities markets is to continue.\22\<NOTE/> Absent established international systems, broker-dealersand their institutional customers often are forced to devote substantialresources to each task related to trade settlement and must effect securitiesdeliveries by physical means, on a trade-by-trade basis. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ <T3>See</T3> Internationalization Report, <T3>supra</T3> note 20.In its November, l988, policy statement, <T3>Regulation of the International Securities Markets,</T3>\23\<NOTE/> the Commission stated that the development of efficient andcomparable automated national and international clearance, settlement,and payment systems is one of the most important international goals. Inthe near term, it is important to develop clearing linkages between existingclearance and settlement systems.\24\<NOTE/> Clearing linkages facilitate cross-border settlements withoutcompromising the essential soundness and integrity of each national clearanceand settlement system.\25\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ <T3>See</T3> Securities and Exchange Commission, <T3>Policy Statement on the Regulation of the International SecuritiesMarkets</T3> (November 1988), Securities Act Release No. 6807, 53 FR 46963(November 21, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Implicit in these goals is the standardization of clearanceand settlement procedures in active trading markets. The Group of Thirty,a private sector group of international businessmen and bankers, recentlyreleased a report recommending standardization of many areas of clearanceand settlement. Among other things, the Group of Thirty recommended adoptionof systems that permit book-entry delivery of securities, earlier and uniformcomparison and settlement periods, and uniform securities identificationnumbering systems. <T3>See</T3> Group of Thirty, <T3>Clearance and Settlement in the World's Securities Markets</T3> (March1989). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ The Federal Reserve Board also has recognized the importanceof obtaining sound clearing and settlement systems, and supported the developmentof coordination between clearing and settlement systems. <T3>See</T3> Speech by Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors ofthe Federal Reserve System, before the Annual Convention of the SecuritiesIndustry Association (November 30, 1988).Firms with substantial international activity that execute several thousandinternational trades a day without adequate centralized clearance and settlementmechanisms are forced to report the details of their trades by telex andawait confirmation by telex. This process is repeated for each transactionand each party to the trade, which often includes five other parties: thebroker's client (investment manager), the client's custodian bank, andthe <T3>contra </T3>broker, investment manager, and custodian bank.\26\<NOTE/> Cash and securities are exchanged via transatlantic courieron a transaction-by-transaction basis.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Disputes regarding the terms of the trade (for example,security, price, or quantity) are reconciled by the additional exchangeof telex messages or telephone calls among the parties.  This physical processing of transaction settlements often subjects theparties to costly delays and increased risk of loss and theft. When broker-dealershave no alternative except to settle transactions individually in sucha decentralized manner, they place enormous burdens on their back-officeprocessing capabilities, particularly during periods of high volume.\27\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ To illustrate, one need only examine the crisis the U.S.securities industry faced in the late 1960s during a period of unprecedentedvolume. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13163 (January 13, 1977),42 FR 3916 (January 21, 1977) (``NSCC temporary registration order'');Securities and Exchange Commission, Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practicesof Brokers and Dealers, H.R. Doc. 231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1971).One response to these problems has been the development of internationalclearance and settlement links among central facilities serving distinctlocal markets, which can offer  international market participants centralizedcommunication facilities; automated data processing; immobilization ofsecurities certificates; and, through future enhancements such as netting,reduced money and securities transfer.\28\<NOTE/> The creation of ISCC, whose primary function is to forgenew clearance and settlement links, is a significant response to the increasingneed for international clearance and settlement mechanisms.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See generally</T3> Becker andamp; Etter, International Clearance andSettlement, 14<T3> Brooklyn J. Int'l. L.</T3> 271 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. ISCC Services </ITAG>ISCC intends to act as a ``window'' through which members and foreign financialinstitutions may send their international securities transactions for centralized,automated clearance and settlement. Each link operates as a separate window,and each link agreement sets out the services to be performed by, and theresponsibilities of, each party to the link. Links generally will be oftwo types: (1) Inbound links, whereby ISCC sponsors foreign financial institutionson behalf of themselves or their members into NSCC and the Depository TrustCompany (``DTC'') \29\<NOTE/> and, through those entities, into the national clearanceand settlement system (``National System''); and (2) outbound links, wherebyISCC arranges with a foreign financial institution to permit use of theforeign entity's clearance and settlement services by ISCC members.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ DTC is a registered clearing agency that acts as a custodianfor securities.<T3> See</T3> Full Registration Order,<T3> supra</T3> note 5, 48 FR at 45178-82. Generally, links will entail efficient, automated data transmission andprovide the capability of settling trades in the currency of the securities'domicile. Moreover, the increased automation and reliability that ISCC'slinks will bring to international trading also should promote market liquidity.Automation and centralization generally should lead to earlier settlements,which also frees capital more quickly. The links offer to non-U.S. market participants the advantage of accessto domestic clearance and settlement systems, and to U.S. market participantsthe advantage of access to the clearance and settlement systems of foreignfinancial institutions. The Commission believes that it is important to develop clearing linkagesamong major national securities markets, as links provide a current viablemeans of clearing and settling international transactions and links donot depend on the existence of identical, or even comparable, systems ineach country. Moreover, more frequent interchanges among internationalclearing entities may encourage clearing entities   to strive for greateruniformity among their systems.\30\<NOTE/>  Greater contacts may encourage those markets where the developmentof efficient, automated systems has lagged to move forward more quickly.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Although these linkage arrangements provide substantiallyimproved mechanisms for clearance and settlement of international trades,they do not address the problem of coordinating settlements among foreignclearing entities with widely differing settlement cycles, system capabilities,or financial responsibility and operational standards. Some of these concerns,especially coordinated settlements across markets, are addressed by theGroup of Thirty in its March, 1989 recommendations on clearance and settlement.<T3> See</T3> note 24,<T3> supra.</T3> a.<T3> Inbound Links.</T3> The U.S. national clearance and settlement systemprovides facilities for comparison, clearance, and settlement of tradesin U.S. securities issues eligible for processing at NSCC and other registeredclearing agencies, and access to DTC and other depositories for custodyand other services for depository-eligible issues. Inbound links may providenon-U.S. market participants with indirect access to some or all of theseservices through ISCC sponsorship, \31\<NOTE/> such as the National Over-the-Counter Comparison System \32\<NOTE/> and the National   Institutional Delivery System (``NIDS'').\33\<NOTE/> These systems enable centralized settlements of substantiallyall street-side and customer-side (institutional) trading in U.S. securitiesmarkets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ ISCC intends generally to sponsor linked foreign financialinstitutions into NSCC and DTC. ISCC will make clearing fund contributionsto NSCC and DTC, and will require the sponsored foreign financial institutionto reimburse it for the amount of those contributions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ The National Over-the-Counter Comparison System, operatedby NSCC, includes comparison of over-the-counter transactions by NSCC membersand by members of other registered clearing agencies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ The NIDS system enables broker-dealers, investment managers,and custodian banks that are members of a securities depository (MidwestSecurities Trust Company, Philadelphia Depository Trust Company, and DTC),directly or through other members, to confirm and affirm the terms of theirtrades, and, on the settlement date, automatically to debit or credit themembers' cash and security accounts, as applicable. All the usual NIDSrules and procedures would apply.<ITAG tagnum="28">DTC currently is operating a pilot program for its new InternationalInstitutional Delivery (``IID'') System. The IID System also permits partiesto an institutional trade to confirm and affirm the terms of their tradesthrough DTC, but does not entail automated settlement at DTC. Instead,the IID System enables quick, efficient communications among parties sothat agent banks and global custodians may notify sub-custodians of settlementinstructions. The IID System accommodates foreign currencies and a varietyof internationally-recognized securities identification numbering systems.Upon successful completion of the pilot program, DTC will offer the IIDsystem to all participants, and eventually may offer the service to linkparticipants. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26374 (December 20, 1988),53 FR 52283 (December 28, 1988). Inbound links also may provide access only to custodial services. Two suchinbound links currently are operational: the ISCC/CDP link and the ISCC/JSCClink. \34\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ Both the CDP and JSCC links involve ISCC sponsoring anaccount at DTC for custody of positions in U.S. securities held by membersof CDP and JSCC, respectively. The links permit book-entry movement ofsecurities, but are limited to free movements only. Thus, money settlementsrelated to the securities movements take place directly between the parties.DTC also provides custody account maintenance services such as dividendand interest collection. To date, activity in the links has been minimal.In December 1988, for example, the JSCC link involved 13 receives and 33deliveries of 1.6 million shares. The Commission believes that inbound clearing links provide many opportunitiesfor reducing the cost and risk of international trading. One benefit isthe capability of bookentry transfer of securities between U.S. banks orbrokerdealers and their non-U.S. trading partners. Non-U.S. traders benefitfrom the ability to use National System services without having to becomedirect members of a registered, U.S. clearing agency. In addition, a linkedU.S. clearing agency has the benefit of a financial intermediary (the linkedforeign financial institution) between itself and the intermediary's members.Presumably, the greater familiarity the intermediary has with standards,customs, and rules in the home country makes it better equipped to monitorits members' activity. b. <T3>Outbound Links. </T3>Outbound links also may vary in the scope of servicesprovided. For example, outbound links, like inbound links, may entail custody,data communications, comparison, clearance or settlement, or some combinationof these services. To date, the Division has considered two outbound ISCClinks: (1) With ISE, which provides access by ISCC members to the ISE'scomparison, clearance, and settlement system for transactions in U.K. equitysecurities; and (2) with CEDEL whereby ISCC transmits certain deliveryand payment instructions to CEDEL on behalf of joint ISCC/CEDEL members.\35\<NOTE/> The current ISCC/ISE limited pilot outbound link involvesISCC sponsoring members into ISE on a fully-disclosed basis for clearanceand settlement of transactions in U.K. equity securities.\36\<NOTE/> ISCC members thus obtain the comparison, clearance, settlement,and custodial services of ISE without having to become direct members ofISE.\37\<NOTE/> Based on experience to date with the links, and in particularwith the ISCC/ISE link,\38\<NOTE/> the Commission believes ISCC is operating and has the capacityto operate links in compliance with the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ The CEDEL link is operating with only one participant,but is expected to enable U.S. broker-dealers who are members of both CEDELand ISCC to transmit transaction information through ISCC facilities toCEDEL to facilitate the settlement of transactions in international securitiesissues eligible for CEDEL clearance, settlement, and custody services.<ITAG tagnum="28">Members submit data to ISCC in a standardized format, which ISCC transmitsto CEDEL. CEDEL receives the transmissions, and settles and safekeeps securitiesin accordance with its usual procedures and the members' instructions,mails reports to the members, and provides reports to ISCC. ISCC makesthese reports available to members on their terminals. Under the termsof the link agreement, ISCC does not sponsor or make available to membersany securities clearance or settlement activities; instead, it enablesmembers to communicate settlement instructions to CEDEL through the useof ISCC's communications facilities. The ISCC/CEDEL link only transmitsdata and is not intended to change CEDEL's processing mechanisms or relationshipsfor the settlement of securities transactions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ On December 23, 1988, ISCC, NSCC, and ISE submitted arequest for a no-action position for an expanded clearance and settlementlinkage. The expanded linkage would establish an inbound link between ISEand ISCC and also would make the current limited pilot outbound link moregenerally available. The Division intends to act on the no-action requestin the near future. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ ISE's comparison system, called CHECKING, is substantiallysimilar to comparison in the U.S. Settlement in the ISE's TALISMAN systemdiffers from U.S. Settlement substantially, however. Settlement in theU.K. is not guaranteed by the ISE. Moreover, settlement in the U.K. occurson one day for an entire trading period. <ITAG tagnum="28">Under the link, ISCC acts as an intermediary for money payments, deliveries,instructions, and reports. Thus, instructions are submitted by membersthrough ISCC to ISE, and processing reports from ISE are transmitted toISCC, which makes them available to members. ISE calculates daily a member'snet settlement cash position and transmits these reports to ISCC. On behalfof its members, ISCC will pay to, or receive from, ISE the net amount indollars and the net amount in pounds sterling. Payment is made throughbank accounts ISCC has established in London for cash settlement purposes.Upon settlement, unless otherwise instructed, ISE automatically will creditthe member's book-entry custody account. Alternatively, the ISCC members,before settlement day, may instruct ISE, through ISCC, to register certificatesin the member's name or in another name. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Under the link agreement, ISCC and ISE guarantee their members' paymentobligations, provided that securities were deposited in the proper accounton the day before settlement day and were allocated by ISE. Neither ISEnor ISCC is responsible for the failure of members to deliver securities.If ISCC incurs a liability to ISE, ISCC's retained earnings and clearingfund would be used in accordance with ISCC's loss allocation proceduresto satisfy the liability. </ITAG><T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>infra</T3>. In addition, NSCC has determined to guarantee the ISCC/ISElink. NSCC would be liable for losses remaining after ISCC's clearing fundand retained earnings were applied to the liability. NSCC may use its retainedearnings and clearing fund (except for the Fund/Serv allocation) to satisfythe losses. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25999 (July 18, 1988),53 FR 27915 (July 25, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Recent statistics for the ISCC/ISE link show that, 23trades settled during the account period whose settlement date was December5, 1988. Fifteen of the trades settled in pounds sterling (andCx.13;1,050,611)and 8 of the trades settled in U.S. dollars ($2,757,677).Outbound links provide U.S. market participants with many benefits. Forexample, the ISCC/CEDEL link will enable U.S. members to transmit instructionsusing ISCC's Global Compass software,\39\<NOTE/> which will greatly simplify processing tasks. The ISCC/ISElink provides members an opportunity to participate in centralized, automatedclearance and settlement systems in the marketplace where the transactionstake place, without having to become direct members of the foreign financialinstitution. That ability offers the same advantages for reducing the costand risk of international trading that were discussed in connection withinbound links. The foreign financial institution also has the benefit ofparticipation by U.S. members under the sponsorship and discipline of aU.S. registered clearing agency. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ ISCC's Global Compass software is a menu-driven systemthat provides participants with a standardized format for entering tradedata and clearance and settlement instructions required to effect internationalsecurities transactions. C. Capacity to Safeguard Funds and SecuritiesAs discussed in detail below, the Commission believes that ISCC has thecapacity to safeguard securities and funds as required by section 17A(b)(3)(A)of the Act. The Commission bases that determination on its review of ISCC'srules, procedures, and facilities management arrangements. Specifically,the Commission has reviewed ISCC's internal accounting controls relatedto recordkeeping, data processing, and ISCC's financial risk managementrules.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Facilities Management </ITAG>ISCC has a facilities management arrangement with the National SecuritiesClearing Corporation (``NSCC''), its sole shareholder and a registeredclearing agency owned by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''),the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''), and the National Associationof Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). As a registered clearing agency,NSCC is subject to Commission oversight under the Act, which includes periodicCommission examinations and an annual review of its internal accountingcontrols by an independent accountant. NSCC has provided comprehensiveclearing agency services for corporate equity and debt securities for morethan ten years, and for municipal securities since 1980. NSCC is the largestclearing agency that offers comprehensive clearing services, and in 1987processed an average of more than 450,000 transactions per day valued atapproximately $19 billion.\40\<NOTE/> NSCC has demonstrated to the Commission that it is a responsibleand innovative clearing agency that complies with the Act.\41\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ <T3>See </T3>NSCC, <T3>1987 Annua1 Report, </T3>at 1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ <T3>See </T3>Full Registration Order, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, 48 FR at 45178-82, in which the Commission determinedthat NSCC was operating in substantial compliance with the Act and grantedNSCC full registration as a clearing agency.  Under the facilities management arrangement, NSCC provides certain servicesdirectly to ISCC, and NSCC provides other services through its facilitiesmanager, the Securities    Industry Automation Corporation (``SIAC''),indirectly to ISCC.\42\<NOTE/> Among the services NSCC provides directly to ISCC are managementand administrative services, including financial, personnel, corporatecommunications, marketing, regulatory and compliance, legal matters, andtechnical services, including data processing, operations, planning anddevelopment, and communications matters. Among the services NSCC providesindirectly to ISCC through SIAC are clerical operations for, among otherthings, trade comparison and correction, forms distribution and inventorymaintenance, billing and cashiering, and computer services related to allthe technical and clerical services rendered by NSCC directly or indirectly. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ SIAC became facilities manager for NSCC when NSCC wasfirst established in 1977. SIAC plans, develops, implements, and managesa variety of automated information-handling and communications systemsfor NSCC and others, including its owners, the Amex and NYSE. SIAC operatesall the comparison systems for NSCC, including NYSE and Amex transactions,over-the-counter market transactions, and municipal bond transactions.SIAC also operates the Continuous Net Settlement system (``CNS'') and RegionalInterface Operation (``RIO'') network for NSCC. The Commission believes,based on 15 years experience with SIAC in the exchange area and more thanten years experience with SIAC as NSCC's Facilities Manager, that SIACis responsible and competent to provide services to ISCC through NSCC. a. <T3>Link Facilities Management Arrangements. </T3>Facilities managementarrangements are established between ISCC and each foreign financial institutionas part of the link agreements and may vary from link to link. As discussedabove, inbound links may entail facilities management    at NSCC and DTC,both of which are registered clearing agencies in which the Commissionhas confidence based on more than ten years experience. The outbound linksnecessarily will entail facilities management at whatever foreign financialinstitution is performing the comparison, clearance, settlement or custodialservices. For example, ISCC must rely on the ISE as facilities managerfor the activity sponsored through the ISCC/ISE link. Each foreign financialinstitution acting as facilities manager has a reputation within its financialcommunity for providing the services offered through a link. The Commissionand its staff will review the facilities management arrangements for eachlink on a case-by-case basis. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Recordkeeping and Data Processing </ITAG>a. <T3>Data Processing. </T3>The Commission believes that the systemic andother controls surrounding ISCC's recordkeeping and data processing functionssatisfy the requirements of the Act. NSCC, through SIAC, provides ISCCwith redundant computer hardware and software and also provides backupcomputer capability. SIAC duplicates all incoming data daily and storesit at an offsite location, which enables SIAC to quickly reconstruct ISCC'sdata base in the event of a disaster. The computer center is equipped withan independent source of power, air conditioning, and water to assure acontinuous processing environment. ISCC receives and transmits data to and from linked foreign financial institutionsand members via computer to computer transmissions from dedicated terminalsor personal computers (PCs) equipped with modems. ISCC uses commercialtelecommunications systems, such as the General Electric Information Service(``GEISCO'') telecommunications system, to transmit link data. ISCC hasdeveloped software to communicate with both its members and foreign financialinstitutions.\43\<NOTE/> Upon receiving information, ISCC may perform edit checks,aggregate data, and reformat data into members' reports or into a formacceptable to foreign financial institutions.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ ISCC uses its Global Compass software in connection withthe ISE and CEDEL links. <T3>See supra </T3>note 39.  b. <T3>Recordkeeping. </T3>The Commission believes that ISCC has the capacityto fulfill its recordkeeping responsibilities under the Act. ISCC's majorrecordkeeping responsibilities are to retain and make copies of all datait receives from members and foreign financial institutions, store it,and make it available to participants and the Commission upon request.c. <T3>Audit Requirements. </T3>NSCC's internal audit department, on behalfof ISCC, reviews the adequacy of ISCC's systems and controls. The AuditCommittee of ISCC's Board of Directors is composed of non-management directors.The Audit Committee oversees internal audit programs implemented by internalor NSCC auditors, makes a recommendation to the ISCC Board of Directorsconcerning the selection of ISCC's independent public accountant, and reviews  the system of internal accounting control with the independent publicaccountant. Under ISCC's rules, the independent public accountant annuallyperforms an evaluation of ISCC's internal accounting controls, and ISCCmust make the accountant's opinion and reports available to all participants.The extent of ISCC's auditors' access to books and records of linked foreignfinancial institutions varies from link to link.\44\<NOTE/> Generally, auditors may consult with the linked entity'sauditors about that entity's financial condition, and will obtain annualfinancial statements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ For example, The ISCC/ISE link, which currently is theonly link that includes money settlement, provides that ISCC's and ISE'sinternal and outside auditors may consult with each other concerning thefinancial condition of the other party and any activity related to linkservices. ISCC and ISE also provide each other audited annual and unauditedsemi-annual financial statements. The ISCC/CDP link provides that CDP hasbecome a member of ISCC and therefore CDP is subject to ISCC Rule 15 wherebyISCC has broad authority to examine a member's financial responsibilityand operational capacity. The ISCC/JSCC link provides that JSCC's auditorsare authorized to consult with ISCC about ISCC's financial condition. ISCCand JSCC also will furnish each other with annual and semi-annual financialstatements, which may be unaudited. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Financial Risk Management </ITAG>The Commission believes that ISCC's rules are designed adequately to protectISCC and its participants against financial losses associated with itsservices. The principal source of risk to ISCC and its participants isthat participants may fail to pay their settlement obligations in a timelymanner or may default on those obligations. ISCC has sought to limit thatrisk by establishing standards for applicants and continuing membership,\45\<NOTE/> and imposing a clearing fund contribution requirement. Inaddition, ISCC has set forth loss allocation procedures for members andrequires collateralization of obligations for foreign financial institutionsthat are not ISCC members but that participate through a link agreementwith ISCC. Because ISCC is structured to link with clearance and settlementsystems outside the United States, and different participants may participatein each link, the risk ISCC faces will vary from link to link and requirescase-by-case consideration to ensure that ISCC has developed safeguardsto minimize all appropriate risks.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ In accordance with section 17A(b)(3)(B) of the Act, ISCC'srules provide that the following categories of persons are authorized tobecome ISCC members: (1) registered brokers and dealers; (2) banks andlimited purpose trust companies supervised by state or federal bankingauthorities; (3) registered clearing agencies; (4) regulated insurancecompanies; (5) registered investment companies; and (6) other entitiesthat have demonstrated that their business and capabilities are such thatthey could reasonably expect material benefit from direct access to ISCC'sServices. ISCC Rule 2.ISCC's membership standards require applicants to have sufficient financialcapacity. Broker-dealer participants must have excess net capital of atleast twice the SEC's minimum net capital requirement and have a capitalratio that would not require the applicant to be placed on immediate surveillanceby ISCC. Bank participants must have at least $50 million in capital orhave furnished ISCC with a payment guarantee by its parent bank holdingcompany (such parent holding company must have at least $50 million incapital). Trust company participants that are members of the Federal ReserveSystem or insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act must have consolidatedcapital of at least $10 million. Banks and trust companies must not beoperating at a loss at the time of application and may not have operatedat a loss in any of the previous three fiscal quarters.\46\<NOTE/> Applicants are required to open their books and records toinspection by ISCC upon request,\47\<NOTE/> and to submit an applicant questionnaire and FOCUS \48\<NOTE/> reports, or other similar financial or regulatory reportswhere applicable.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ The Commission believes that in light of current activity,ISCC's capital requirements are adequate. The Commission is requiring ISCCto review these capital standards as activity increases, and to reconsidercapital standards for members annually as part of its risk assessment. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ ISCC Rule 2, section 2(f).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ FOCUS reports are also known as SEC Form X-17-A-5, Financialand Operational Combined Uniform Single Reports. <T3>See</T3> ISCC Rule 15.  Participants must submit adequate assurances of financial responsibilityand operational capacity including, among other things, periodic additionalreporting requirements, increased clearing fund deposits, or additionalpayments reflecting a percentage of the corporation's daily net debit position.\49\<NOTE/> If a participant fails to meet these requirements, ISCC isauthorized to take a variety of actions, including increasing the participant'sclearing fund deposit,\50\<NOTE/> limiting the participant's activity, or ceasing to act forthe participant.\51\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ ISCC Rule 15.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ ISCC Rule 4 and Rule 15, section 4(b).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ ISCC Rules 18 and 46.  ISCC established a clearing fund to help manage the risk of participantinsolvency. ISCC requires all members to contribute to the clearing fund.\52\<NOTE/> Each member must make a minimum deposit of $50,000 in cash.ISCC also may require additional amounts in excess of $50,000. These additionaldeposits are established by ISCC on a monthly basis according to a predeterminedformula.\53\<NOTE/> The additional clearing fund deposits over $50,000 may becomposed of cash, government securities, and irrevocable letters of creditissued by approved banks.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ With respect to foreign financial institutions that participatein ISCC without becoming members subject to the clearing fund rules, ISCCrequires collateralization of obligations. ISCC will determine on a case-by-casebasis the appropriate financial arrangements to ensure adequate controlover its financial risk. <ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission understands that the required collateralization willnot be less than the amount ISCC must pay to the NSCC or DTC clearing orparticipants' funds on behalf of the foreign financial institution. Moreover,the Commission expects that, in appropriate circumstances, ISCC will requirecollateralization significantly greater than that minimum.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ <T3>See</T3> Addendum A to ISCC Rules. The basis of the formula is useof ISCC's services.  ISCC's rules authorize ISCC to take steps to satisfy any obligations membersfail to satisfy. In the event a member fails to satisfy an obligation toISCC, ISCC may look to the member's clearing fund deposit to satisfy theobligation.\54\<NOTE/> If the member's obligation still is not satisfied, ISCC maythen apply retained earnings to satisfy the loss or liability.\55\<NOTE/> If retained earnings are insufficient to eliminate the lossor liability, ISCC will apply amounts from other members' contributionsto the clearing fund on a <T3>pro rata</T3> basis.\56\<NOTE/> Based on the above rules and procedures, the Commission believesthat ISCC's financial risk allocation scheme is designed to limit the riskof loss to participants.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ In addition, according to ISCC's rules, settlement isnot final until settlement payment is made. ISCC maintains a lien on allproperty placed in its possession by participants, including securitiesand cash. Thus, ISCC may take the securities on which it has a lien intoits own accounts to cover the unpaid obligations. In addition, book-entriesare subject to reclamation, reversal, or similar adjustment, at ISCC'sdiscretion.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ ISCC Rule 4. ISCC Rule 4, section 4 authorizes the Boardof Directors to elect to apply the clearing fund to satisfy such obligationsbefore it applies retained earnings to satisfy such obligations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ Upon applying members' clearing fund deposits to satisfyan obligation, ISCC may demand that members then deposit into the clearingfund amounts necessary to eliminate the resulting deficiency in their requiredclearing fund deposits. If an ISCC member gives proper notice of its determinationto terminate business with ISCC, the member is obligated for the <T3>pro rata</T3> charge, but that obligation is limited to the amountof its required clearing fund deposit as fixed immediately prior to thetime of the <T3>pro rata</T3> charge.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Certificate Custody and Standard of Care </ITAG>a.<T3> Custodial Arrangements.</T3> ISCC is not a depository and does notintend to maintain custody of physical securities certificates. Instead,for inbound links, ISCC has an agreement with DTC, a registered clearingagency, to safekeep DTC-eligible securities certificates held in an ISCC-sponsoredDTC account on behalf of foreign financial institutions with which ISCCis linked. For non-U.S. securities in outbound links, ISCC link agreementswill include provisions for ensuring that custodians outside the U.S. willsafekeep securities. The Commission believes that ISCC's custodial arrangements comply withRules 8c-1 and 15c2-1 under the Act.\57\<NOTE/> ISCC rules provide that ISCC will not have liens on customersecurities where such liens would violate Commission rules 8c-l and 15c2-1.\58\<NOTE/> Moreover, ISCC must provide for compliance with these rulesin link agreements for outbound links that contemplate custodial servicesby foreign financial institutions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ Rules 8c-1 and 15c2-1 under the Act prohibit the hypothecationof customer securities under circumstances that permit the comminglingof customers' securities, without the customers' written consent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ ISCC Rule 18. b.<T3> Standard of Care.</T3> The Act requires clearing agencies to promoteprompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities and to  safeguardsecurities and funds. Clearing agencies must ensure that adequate safeguardsexist for both their custodial and non-custodial functions. ISCC obtainscustodial services on behalf of its participants from sub-custodians. Thestandard of care for custody that ISCC provides is coextensive with thatprovided by the sub-custodian. With respect to inbound links, which enableforeign financial institutions to obtain custodial services in the U.S.for U.S. securities, ISCC obtains custodial services from DTC. As a registeredclearing agency and a limited purpose trust company under state law, DTCis subject to the negligence standard of care regarding safekeeping participants'securities and funds.\59\<NOTE/> With respect to outbound links, ISCC obtains custodial servicesfrom the foreign financial institution. For example, ISE is the custodianfor U.K. securities settled through the ISCC/ISE link. The ISCC/ISE linkagreement specifies that ISE is subject to the negligence standard of care.\60\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ <T3>See</T3> Full Registration Order,<T3> supra</T3> note 5, 48 FR at 45179. In that order, the Commission statedthat, as a limited purpose trust company, DTC is responsible under stateor federal law, or both, to protect each participant's securities and funds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ The standard of care for each outbound link will be determinedby each link agreement. These standards may differ because the custodialfunctions will be performed outside the U.S., and the law of the countryin which the custodial services will be performed will apply. The Commissionbelieves that if international links are to develop to support global trading,a uniform standard of care for the custody of securities should be developed. The Commission reviews non-custodial clearing agency services on a case-by-casebasis \61\<NOTE/> and, in determining the appropriate standard of care, balancesthe need for a high degree of clearing agency care with the effect theresulting liabilities may have on clearing agency operations, costs, andsafeguarding securities and funds.\62\<NOTE/> To date, ISCC generally has offered its services under agross negligence standard of care, and has obtained the same standard ofcare from the non-U.S. exchanges and clearing entities with which it hasentered into link agreements. The Commission believes that this standardof care is consistent with the Act and earlier interpretations of section17A concerning non-custodial clearing agency functions. Historically, theCommission has left to user-governed clearing agencies the question ofhow to allocate losses associated with non-custodial, data processing,clearing agency functions, and has approved clearing agency services embodyinga gross negligence standard of care.\63\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that a gross negligence standardof care may be appropriate for certain non-custodial functions that, consistentwith minimizing risk mutualization, clearing agency members, through theirBoard of Directors, determine to allocate to individual service users.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ The Commission believes that, rather than promulgatea specific standard of care for non-custodial functions, the preferableapproach is for the clearing agency and its participants to establish theirown standard because a standard of care represents an allocation of rightsand liabilities between a clearing agency and its participants. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, Full Registration Order, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, 48 FR at 45179 and Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 22940 (February 24, 1986), 51 FR 7169. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>Id.</T3> D. Other Determinations <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Capacity to Comply with the Act and to Enforce Compliance bv Membersand Participants </ITAG>a. <T3>ISCC Compliance with the Act. </T3>Section 27A(b)(3)(A) of the Actrequires that ISCC have the capacity to comply with the provisions of theAct and the rules and regulations thereunder. Commission rules requireISCC to keep and preserve certain records,\64\<NOTE/> obtain and retain fingerprints from personnel,\65\<NOTE/> and register and participate in the Commission's Lost andStolen Securities Program (Program) in compliance with Rule 17f-1 underthe Act.\66\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that ISCC and its facilities manager,NSCC, have the capacity to maintain records in accordance with the Commission'srequirements. The Commission also believes that ISCC and NSCC have thecapacity to obtain and process fingerprints for appropriate personnel. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ Rule 17a-1 requires a registered clearing agency to keepand preserve at least one copy of all documents, including all correspondence,memoranda, papers, books, notices, accounts, and other such records itshall make or receive in the course of its business. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ Rule 17f-2 requires a registered clearing agency to requirethat each of its partners, directors, officers, and employees be fingerprinted,unless they do not regularly have access to, or do not supervise thosewho have access to, the keeping, handling, or processing of securities,money, or the original books and records relating to the securities ormoney. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ Rule 17f-1 requires a registered clearing agency to registerand participate in the Lost and Stolen Securities Program (``Program'').Under the Program, a registrant is required to report the discovery ofa theft or loss of a security to the Program's data base, and to inquireof the data base with respect to securities that come into its possessionwhether the securities have been reported lost, missing, stolen, or counterfeit.With respect to Rule 17f-1, the Commission has determined that ISCC isrequired to comply with Rule 17f-1 by participating in the Lost and StolenSecurities Program on its own behalf and on behalf of foreign financialinstitutions with whom ISCC is linked. The reporting and inquiry responsibilitiesunder Rule 17f-1 should be undertaken by the registered clearing agencythat sponsors a foreign financial institution into the U.S. national clearanceand settlement system. Rule 17f-1 was developed pursuant to section 17(f)(1) under the Act. Section17(f)(1) was adopted following a series of Congressional hearings and aSecurities and Exchange Commission study about problems with traffickingin lost, stolen, missing, and counterfeit securities.\67\<NOTE/> One recognized benefit of that section is its potential todecrease the likelihood that securities firms will bear a financial lossas a result of giving value for securities that are worthless. Rule 17f-1sets forth an enumerated category of ``reporting institutions'' that mustreport instances of loss, theft and counterfeiting of securities to a centraldata base maintained for the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')by its designee and that must inquire of the data base whether securitiescoming into their possession have been reported to the data base as lost,stolen or counterfeit. Among the enumerated ``reporting institutions''required to comply with the rule are registered clearing agencies and participantstherein.\68\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ Organized Crime_Stolen Securities, Hearings Before thePermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senate Committee on GovernmentOperations, 92nd Cong., 2d Sess. (1974).<T3> See also</T3> Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices of Broker-Dealers,Report and Recommendation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (pursuantto section 11(h) of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970), December1970. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ Other reporting institutions include national securitiesexchanges, members thereof, national securities associations, broker, dealers,municipal securities dealers, government securities brokers and dealers,registered transfer agents, federally-insured banks, and members of theFederal Reserve System. As a registered clearing agency, ISCC intends to form linkages with foreignfinancial institutions to support more efficient clearance and settlementof international securities transactions. Some of the linkages requirethat foreign financial institutions become participants in ISCC.\69\<NOTE/> Thus, these foreign financial institutions, as participantsin ISCC, would become ``reporting institutions'' with reporting and inquiryobligations under Rule  17f-1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ Section 3(a)(24) of the Act defines a participant ofa clearing agency. Compliance with Rule 17f-1 may pose difficulties for a foreign financialinstitution with access to ISCC services and  for members of such a foreignfinancial institution. For example, a member of a foreign financial institutionmight be authorized to submit securities certificates directly to ISCCfor deposit to the foreign financial institution's account. In that case,the foreign financial institution may not have access to the securitiesto enable an inquiry in compliance with Rule 17f-1.\70\<NOTE/> ISCC, however, can be expected to have access to the certificatesand to make an inquiry upon receipt. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ In addition, because of their geographical location,foreign financial institutions would incur high costs of compliance withthe Rule, as inquiries are made by telephone, telex, or mail. Further,inquiries through the international mails may be subject to delays. Thelonger an inquiry takes, the more likely it is that a firm already hasgiven value; thus, the benefits of Rule 17f-1 are reduced. The deterrence benefit and the benefit of protection from giving valuefor worthless securities derived from Rule 17f-1 remain important evenwhen U.S. securities are physically handled outside the U.S. To ignoreRule 17f-1 in these circumstances would be to encourage the traffickingin lost, stolen or counterfeit U.S. securities outside the boundaries ofthe U.S. Accordingly, in the context of an international linkage sponsored by aregistered clearing agency, the Commission believes it is appropriate forthe clearing agency to assume the functions of the foreign financial institution/reportinginstitution for purposes of Rule 17f-1. The Commission will deem the foreignfinancial institution/reporting institution to  be in compliance with Rule17f-1 so long as the registered clearing agency performs the obligationsthat the foreign financial institution/reporting institution otherwiseshould have performed.The Commission will look to a clearing agency for compliance with the Rulein these circumstances for a number of reasons. First, because the clearingagency already is a regulated entity that is required to comply with Rule17f-1, it is familiar with Program procedures and requirements. In addition,the costs of inquiry for a domestic entity are less than they would befor a foreign financial institution, thereby avoiding situations wherecosts of compliance might outweigh the Rule's benefits. Moreover, a clearingagency having a direct relationship with a foreign financial institutionis in a better position than the Commission to know whether the foreignfinancial institution is complying with the Rule's reporting requirements.Thus, in addition to its own compliance responsibilities under Rule 27f-1,the registered clearing agency must report instances of loss, theft, andcounterfeiting with respect to U.S. securities certificates in the custodyor control of the foreign entity. The clearing agency is responsible fornotifying all foreign entities that have access to the clearing agency'sservices that the foreign entity must report all instances of loss, theft,and counterfeiting of which it becomes aware to the clearing agency forinput into the data base.\71\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ In addition, when securities certificates come into theclearing agency's custody or control, however temporarily, from a foreignentity, the clearing agency must inquire about the status of those certificates,and may not rely on Rule 17f-1(d)(1)(ii), which permits an exemption frominquiry when the securities certificates are received from another reportinginstitution where the reporting institution is a foreign financial institution.Of course, if any other inquiry exemption applies in the circumstances,the clearing agency may rely upon that exemption and not inquire. ISCC's participation in the Program as outlined here will help to accomplishthe Program's goal of deterring trafficking in lost, stolen, and counterfeitsecurities. Moreover, ISCC's participation will ensure a more completedata base, which will decrease the likelihood that market participantswill bear a financial loss as a result of giving value for worthless securities.Based upon a review of ISCC's rules and procedures, and the facilitiesmanagement arrangement, and the Commission's continuing experience withISCC's operations covered by the no-action letters and with NSCC as a registeredclearing agency, the Commission believes that ISCC has the capacity tocomply with the Act and its rules and regulations. b. <T3>ISCC Enforcement of Member Compliance. </T3>Section 17A(b)(3)(A) ofthe Act envisions clearing agency registration only upon a determinationby the Commission that the clearing agency has the capacity to enforceparticipant compliance with its rules. The Standards Release noted in this context that a clearing agency's organization and capacity to enforcecompliance are determined by evaluating its procedures for determiningwhether a participant is experiencing financial or operational difficulties,its arrangements for exchanging information with other self-regulatoryorganizations (``SROs''), and the adequacy of its examining staff to enforcecompliance by participants with the clearing agency's rules.\72\<NOTE/> For example, a clearing agency may monitor participants'outstanding fails-to-receive and fails-to-deliver to determine each participants'continuing financial condition and ability to make payments when due. Asanother example, a clearing agency may monitor participants' operationsfor compliance with its procedures for maintaining office personnel ormeeting processing cut-off times or other requirements. The Commissionis satisfied that ISCC has developed and will continue to develop proceduresfor monitoring participants' financial and operational condition. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ Section 17(d)(1) of the Act and Rule 17d-2 thereunderprovide for some relief from regulatory responsibilities. Thus, clearingagencies (or any SROs) may file for Commission approval plans allocatingspecified self-regulatory responsibilities among themselves regarding jointmembers. To date, no clearing agency has filed such a plan. ISCC relies on its own staff and that of its facilities manager, NSCC,to enforce compliance. Staff at NSCC have more than ten years experienceoperating NSCC's procedures for monitoring participants. The Commissionis satisfied that such  experienced staff will ensure that ISCC's procedurescomply with the Act and the Standards Release.ISCC has procedures in place for sharing information with NSCC and DTCon inbound links.\73\<NOTE/> Because ISCC has links with foreign financial institutionsfor clearance and settlement at those institutions, the Commission believesISCC (and other clearing agencies with international links) should workwith linked foreign financial institutions to make arrangements for sharinginformation upon request about the financial and operational conditionof joint members or affiliates. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ In 1984, clearing agencies and other SROs establishedformal procedures for communications whenever a joint member's financialcondition threatens the financial or operational condition of member firms,clearing agencies, or marketplaces. Recently, clearing agencies, includingNSCC and DTC, agreed to strengthen the 1984 procedures by cooperating inthe Securities Coordination Group to identify participants whose financialor operational condition poses risks and to share information about jointmembers. As facilities manager for ISCC, NSCC will act on behalf of ISCCin these matters.  Under the Act, a clearing agency also must have the authority and abilityto discipline members that violate its rules through appropriate sanctionsfor such violations, and must provide fair procedures for the impositionof such sanctions.\74\<NOTE/> ISCC's rules contain disciplinary procedures to enforce compliancewith its rules.\75\<NOTE/> Under ISCC's rules, ISCC may impose a fine of up to $5,000for each violation of ISCC's rules or procedures and may also expel, suspend,censure, limit, or restrict the activities, functions, or operations of,any member which violates ISCC's rules or procedures or may develop anothersanction which appropriately addresses the violation.\76\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ <T3>See</T3> section 17A(b)(3) (G) and (H) of the Act.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ lSCC Rule 48. Section 19(d) of the Act requires a registeredclearing agency to provide notice of final disciplinary action to the appropriateregulatory agency for the clearing agency and (if other than the appropriateregulatory agency for the clearing agency) the appropriate regulatory agencyfor the participant or applicant.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ Provisions for enforcing compliance by participants thatare foreign financial institutions are contained in the link agreements,and vary from link to link. As a general matter, ISCC enforces compliancewith its rules or with the link agreements through the ability to declarea breach of contract, and therefore to stop performance of link obligations.  ISCC's rules provide that before ISCC will impose any disciplinary sanctionother than summary suspension against a member, it will notify the memberof the charges against it, and of the member's right to a hearing to ensurethat members are offered the opportunity to explain their actions beforesanctions are determined, and that sanctions are fairly imposed. When ISCCsummarily suspends, or summarily limits or prohibits a member's accessto ISCC services, the member is not guaranteed the opportunity to a hearingprior to the imposition of a sanction. Such a member will be provided witha written statement of the grounds for the decision and will be notifiedof its right to request a hearing after the sanction has been imposed.ISCC's rules authorize its Membership Committee to impose summary sanctionsagainst a member whose actions fall within the grounds specified in ISCCRule 46.\77\<NOTE/> Under the Act, the affected member may appeal final clearingagency decisions to the Commission. The Commission believes that theseprocedures for disciplining members fulfill the requirements of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ Section 17A(b)(5)(c) of the Act states that a clearingcorporation may impose summary action against a participant if he (1) hasbeen expelled or suspended from any SRO; (2) is in default of any deliveryof funds or securities to the clearing agency; or (3) is in such financialor operating difficulty that the clearing corporation determines that suchaction is necessary for the protection of the clearing corporation, itsparticipants, its creditors or investors. ISCC's Rule 46 authorizes ISCCto impose summary sanctions in accordance with the above standards. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Fair Representation </ITAG>Section 17A(b)(3)(C) requires that a clearing agency's rules assure fairrepresentation to its participants and shareholders in the selection ofits directors and administration of its affairs. The Commission has interpretedthe fair representation standard to require clearing agency rules thatare designed to facilitate continuing fair representation of a clearingagency's participants and shareholders.\78\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ The Act does not define fair representation or set upparticular standards of representation. Instead, it provides that the Commissionmust determine whether the rules of the clearing agency regarding the mannerin which decisions are made give fair voice to participants as well asto shareholders in the selection of directors and the administration ofits affairs. With respect to providing participants with a meaningful opportunityto be represented in the selection of the board of directors and the administrationof the clearing agency's affairs, the Standards counsel that each clearingagency's procedures be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. <T3>See</T3> Standards Release, <T3>supra</T3> note 11, 45 FR at 41923.As discussed below, the Commission is temporarily exempting ISCC from compliancewith Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act. lSCC's By-Laws and Shareholder Agreementset forth the provisions establishing the number and composition of theBoard of Directors as well as the procedures for the election of Directors.The Shareholder Agreement provides that ISCC's Board of Directors willbe composed of both management and participant directors. ISCC's Board is authorized for a maximum of 22 members \79\<NOTE/> and is composed of four classes with staggered terms to ensurethat new directors are elected each year. Members of Class I, Class II,and Class III are elected to three year terms and members of Class IV areelected to one year terms. Classes I through III each shall consist offour directors, who shall be general partners or officers of participants(``Participant Directors''). Class IV shall consist of ten directors, eightof whom shall be nominees of NSCC (``Shareholder Directors''), anotherof whom shall be the President of ISCC, and another of whom shall be anotherofficer of ISCC (the ``Management Directors''). NSCC may designate oneof the eight Shareholder Directors for election by the Board of Directorsof ISCC as  Vice-Chairman of ISCC, unless the Board of Directors determinesthat another director shall hold such office.\80\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ ISCC Bylaws, Article II, section 2.1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ ISCC Shareholder Agreement, section 2. Individuals are nominated to serve on the Board of Directors either bythe Nominating Committee or by participant petition. A Nominating Committeewill nominate candidates for the Board.\81\<NOTE/> The Nominating Committee will be divided into two classesto provide for the staggering of the terms of Committee members so thatnew members will be seated on the Nominating Committee each year. Participantsmay nominate directly individuals for seats on either the Board of Directorsor on the Nominating Committee by submitting to ISCC's Corporate Secretarya nominating petition signed by the lesser of 5% of the number of participantsor 15 participants. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ Section 2A(ii) of the Shareholder Agreement states thatthe members of the Nominating Committee for the years 1987, 1988, and 1989shall be the members of the Board of its parent corporation, NSCC. A newNominating Committee will be constituted immediately following each annualmeeting. Beginning in l990 (and continuing throughout all succeeding years)the Nominating Committee shall be composed of seven members, divided intotwo classes. The initial members of Class I will serve for one year andthe initial members of Class II will serve for two years. After the initialmembers of Class I have been replaced, all subsequent members will servetwo year terms. Upon the submission of a slate of candidates by the Nominating Committee,NSCC, as sole shareholder, shall elect those candidates to be the participantdirectors. If a participant submits a nomination for a participant director,  ISCC's Secretary shall mail ballots to participants listing the namesof all candidates, and participants may vote on the candidates.\82\<NOTE/> NSCC has agreed to vote its shares to elect as participantdirectors those candidates who receive the highest number of votes.\83\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ A participant's voting rights are determined in accordancewith a formula based on ISCC usage. This formula states that each participantshall be entitled to the total of one vote for each ten dollars of averagemonthly fee payable or paid, by the participant to ISCC during the twelvemonth period ending on the last day of the second month prior to the dateof determination by ISCC of the number of votes to which each participantis entitled, multiplied by the number of persons to be elected ParticipantDirectors. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ ISCC Shareholder Agreement, section 2. ISCC has requested an exemption from section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act topermit NSCC to retain voting control on ISCC's Board of Directors untilthe earlier of: (1) the time ISCC has 25 active participants; or (2) 1992.\84\<NOTE/> Currently, ISCC has 12 participants, including two foreignfinancial institutions. Of these, only 4 participant members are activeusers of the ISCC/ISE link, ISCC's most active link. ISCC therefore doesnot believe that it currently has a meaningful participant base.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Robert J. Woldow, Executive Vice President andGeneral Counsel, NSCC, to Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, SEC, undated,received March 30, 1989. The Commission agrees that ISCC does not yet have a meaningful participantbase that requires the protections of the fair representation provisionsof the Act. If only a small   number of participants were able to use theprovisions for nomination of Board of Directors and Nominating Committeemembers, each participant may have inordinate, and unintended control ofthe nominations and voting. Moreover, NSCC has a substantial interest incontrolling ISCC's Board of Directors in the present circumstances becauseof the financial risk NSCC faces on ISCC's behalf. As part of the ISCC/ISEagreement, NSCC has guaranteed ISCC's obligations to ISE arising out ofthat link. The ISCC clearing fund, composed of contributions from membersbased on use of ISCC services, currently is the only source of funds ISCChas to meet those obligations. Until ISCC has a greater number of participantsactively using its services and contributing to the clearing fund, theclearing fund will remain at a minimal level and not serve as a substantialbuffer to NSCC. Thus, until an effective buffer in the form of a more substantialclearing fund or other measure is adopted, NSCC has an interest in continuingto exercise appropriate control over ISCC and its affairs.The Commission has determined to exempt ISCC from section 17A(b)(3)(C)of the Act, and thus to permit ISCC and NSCC to waive the participant nominationand voting provisions in the Shareholder Agreement, for a period of 18months, which is the duration of ISCC's temporary registration.\85\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ ISCC has represented that notwithstanding the exemption,Participant Directors at all times will comprise at least 40% of the ISCCBoard of Directors.<T3> See</T3> letter from Karen L. Saperstein, Associate General Counsel,ISCC, to Sandy Sciole, Special Counsel, SEC, dated May 9, 1989. The Commission finds that such exemption is consistent with the publicinterest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of section 17A,including the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds. The Commission will review the need for the exemption within the 18-monthperiod. In addition, should the number of ISCC active participants or theamount of ISCC's clearing fund materially change before the end of the18 month period, the Commission, by order, may modify or terminate theexemption within the 18 month period. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Competition </ITAG>Section l7A of the Act directs the Commission to have due regard for themaintenance of fair competition among brokers, dealers, clearing agencies,and transfer agents. Section 17A(b)(3)(1) provides that a clearing agency'srules do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriatein furtherance of the purpose of the Act. As discussed below, the Commissionbelieves that ISCC's rules and its registration as a clearing agency willnot impose any inappropriate burdens on competition. The Commission believes that ISCC's services can make efficient, automatedprocessing available to a wide universe of institutions by decreasing theneed for each institution to develop its own in-house, decentralized processingsystems and reducing personnel and other expenses associated with transactionprocessing. ISCC's rules permit a wide range of financial institutionsto apply for membership. The Commission believes that ISCC's registration will not result in anyinappropriate burdens on competition on banks or other entities providingclearing services. Institutions conducting trades in foreign securitiesmay continue to use the methods they used prior to ISCC's establishmentto clear and settle these trades. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Fees </ITAG>Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act requires a clearing agency's rules to allocateequitably among participants reasonable fees, dues, and other charges.Section 17A(b)(3)(E) also provides that clearing agency rules not imposeany schedule of prices, or fix rates, for services rendered by participants.The Commission's staff has reviewed ISCC's fee schedule and found eachservice fee to be allocated equitably among participants using that service.Moreover, ISCC's rules do not in any manner impose prices or fix ratesfor services provided by its participants. Accordingly, the Commissionbelieves that ISCC's rules and fees are consistent with the above statutorystandards. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusions and Determinations </ITAG>The Commission has reviewed ISCC's application for registration as a clearingagency pursuant to Sections 17A(b)(3)(A),(B), and (D) through (I) and 19(a)(1)of the Act and ISCC's request for exemption from section 17A(b)(3)(C) ofthe Act pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-1 thereunder. After reviewing ISCC's applicationfor registration, the Commission has determined that ISCC is so organizedand has the capacity to be able to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions for which it is responsible andto safeguard funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible;to comply with the provisions of the Act and the rules and regulationsthereunder; to enforce compliance by its participants with the rules ofthe clearing agency; and to carry out the purposes of section 17A. The Commission also has determined that, in accordance with section 17A(b)(3)(F)of the Act, the ISCC rules are designed to promote prompt and accurateclearance and settlement of securities transactions; to assure the safeguardingof securities and funds which are in the custody or control of ISCC orfor which it is responsible; to foster cooperation and coordination withpersons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions;to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national systemfor the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions;to prevent unfair discrimination in the admission of participants or amongparticipants in the use of ISCC; and, in general, to protect investorsand the public interest. In addition, the Commission has determined thatISCC's rules provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, feesand other charges among its participants; do not impose any schedule ofprices, or fix rates or other fees, for services rendered by its participants;provide for appropriate discipline of participants for violation of anyprovision of ISCC's rules by expulsion, suspension, limitation of activities,functions and operations, fines, censure, or any other fitting sanction;provide a fair procedure with respect to the disciplining of participants,the denial of participation to any person seeking participation therein,and the prohibition or limitation by ISCC of any person with respect toaccess to services offered by the clearing agency; and do not impose anyburden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of thepurposes of the Act. With regard to ISCC's request for a temporary exemption from section 17A(b)(3)(C)of the Act, the Commission believes it is appropriate to temporarily exemptISCC from the fair representation requirements as embodied in the provisionfor direct participant nomination of Board of Directors candidates foundin ISCC's Shareholder Agreement with NSCC. The Commission finds that suchexemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors,and the purposes of section 17A. The Commission reserves the right to modify,by order (including such orders as the Commission may issue under section19(b) of the Act), the terms and scope of the exemption from the fair representationrequirements, if it determines such modification is appropriate for theprotection of investors or in the public interest. <T3>It is therefore ordered,</T3> Pursuant to sections 17A(b)(2) and 19(a)of the Act, that ISCC's temporary registration be, and it hereby is, grantedfor a period of 18 months, and that ISCC is hereby granted an exemptionfrom the fair representation standard in section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act,to be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
