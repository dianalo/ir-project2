Lloyd Bentsen of Texas is best known for what he has donein a 40-year political career _ win elections and then get the jobdone in office.   ``I know there are those who would take perhaps the politicalversion of a St. Ignatius approach, saying that they want pureideology.'' he says. ``And if you practice that to the ultimate,you finally have yourself a party of one, and you sure don't winany elections.''   Bentsen, the Democrats' vice presidential choice, believes inwinning.   The son of a wealthy landowner in the Rio Grande Valley. LloydMillard Bentsen Jr. was a 24-year-old World War II veteran when hewon his first office, Hidalgo County Judge.   At 27, in 1948, he won a seat in the U.S. House ofRepresentatives, making him the youngest congressman at the time.During his first term, he cast a vote against the poll tax, whichwas being used to keep blacks from voting. He was one of just twoSouthern congressmen to vote that way, and he frequently now pointsto that as an example of his strong commitment to civil rights.   People were beginning to talk about Bentsen as a governor orsenator, but in 1954, he dropped out of politics after only threeterms in the House.   Bentsen and his wife Beryl Ann, a former fashion model whom hemarried while in the service, moved back to Texas to raise theirtwo sons and one daughter. Over the next 16 years, Bentsen built asuccessful insurance and investment business that left him amillionaire.   His father, now 94, told him if he left politics he would nevergo back. But the bug bit him again in 1970.   Bentsen entered the Democratic primary and upset incumbent Sen.Ralph Yarborough. In the general election, he defeated RepublicanRep. George Bush, a feat he's now trying to repeat in the nationalarena.   As a senator, Bentsen has gained a reputation as a lawmaker'slawmaker, a dealmaker _ not always the stuff presidentialcandidates are made of. He found that out in 1976, when he made arun for the Democratic nomination for president and was defeated bythe former Georgia governor, Jimmy Carter. He kept his Senate seatthough, and was re-elected with a powerful 60 percent six years ago.   As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee for the past twoyears, Bentsen has racked up an impressive string ofaccomplishments.   The panel has approved welfare reform legislation currentlybefore a House-Senate conference committee, and President Reaganhas signed a Bentsen-pushed catastrophic illness protection billexpanding the Medicare system.   The huge trade bill vetoed by Reagan also came through hiscommittee, including the 60-day notice for plant closings that ledto a Reagan veto. The Democratic Congress just sent the noticeprovision back to Reagan as a separate bill _ and campaign issue.   Tucked into the trade bill is a provision repealing the windfallprofits tax on oil, an example of Bentsen's successful blend oflocal interests and national issues. It's part of a theme that runsthrough Bentsen's career _ compromising to get things done.   ``Lloyd is ideal,'' says House Speaker Jim Wright, a friend formore than three decades. ``He doesn't go overboard in anydirection.''   Bentsen's not the back-slapping, touchy-feely kind of politiciantypical of Capitol Hill. His style is often described as aloof andpatrician, something he disputes by citing his campaign swingsthrough the barrios of south Texas where he speaks with theresidents in fluent Spanish.   But people still recall when a young staffer once made themistake of calling him Lloyd. ``We worked very hard to earn thetitle Senator,'' he admonished the youth. ``Let's use it.''   Bentsen walks the halls of the Capitol with an erect, athleticgait that belies his 67 years. He was playing tennis only hoursbefore Michael Dukakis picked him up in Washington for the trip toAtlanta.   He has the demeanor of a conservative businessman, but hisSenate voting record has been consistently middle-of-the-road,according to ratings given by both liberal and conservative groups.It would be wrong to say Bentsen's priorities have drifted withouta rudder. His issues just don't cut cleanly across the ideologicalspectrum between political extremes.   Bentsen is a conservative _ certainly, compared to Dukakis _ onnational defense and foreign policy. He has voted for aid to theContra rebels in Nicaragua and for the MX missile, spending thatDukakis strongly opposes.   On domestic issues, he supports prayer in schools and opposesrestrictions on handguns, again positions opposite those of hismore liberal running mate. Dukakis has called President Reagan's1981 tax cuts a monumental mistake, but Bentsen not only voted forthem but was one of the earliest supporters of reducing businesstaxes to spur economic growth, years before Reagan came to power.   On the other hand, he was a supporter of the Equal RightsAmendment and of legal abortions, though not always spendingfederal money on them.   And while Dukakis has been critical of Political ActionCommittee fund raising, Bentsen is a master. In 1987, shortly afterbecoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Bentsen formed a$10,000-a-seat ``breakfast club'' for lobbyists to raise money forhis Senate campaign.   Bentsen, who has also supported campaign reform legislation,quickly disbanded the club after it was made public and calls it``a doozy'' of a mistake.   Neither Bentsen nor Dukakis will admit to any consternationabout those differences. Indeed, Dukakis asserts that he ``doesn'twant a clone'' for a vice president. Bentsen says it's just a caseof practicing ``the politics of inclusion'' that will win the WhiteHouse for the Democrats in November.   And that kind of pragmatic approach to politics and issues couldwell be the two men's greatest commonality.   Bentsen seems happy with his ascension to the ticket andcomfortable with it.   Back in his days as a World War II bomber pilot, Bentsen oncewas forced to land his disabled plane on a strip on the island ofViz in the Adriatic. An armed group came out to meet the Americans.   ``I climbed out of the plane and walked toward them, hoping theywere friendly, only to have a man about my age emerge from thegroup,'' Bentsen said in an article he later wrote.   ``I said, `Don't I know you?'''   ``He looked (at) me and said, `Sure, you're Bentsen. I used tosack groceries for your mother when she went to the grocerystore.'''   He still clearly enjoys that feeling of recognition.</TEXT></DOC>
