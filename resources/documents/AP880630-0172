In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, theenvironmentalists contend the flights over the million-acre areaviolate federal law, disrupt the area's solitude and harm wolvesand other wildlife.   They contend the Air Guard and the Federal AviationAdministration have failed to assess the environmental impact ofthe flights.   Since 1949, the federal government has banned flights over theBWCA lower than 4,000 feet above sea level. The environmentalgroups contend military jets have flown below that level, which inmost places is 2,000 to 2,500 feet above the ground.   Suing are the national Izaak Walton League, Friends of theBoundary Waters Wilderness and Friends of Animals and TheirEnvironment. Named as defendants are the top officials of the FAAand the National Guard Bureau, which oversees the Air Guard.   Don Leyden, an FAA spokesman in Washington, D.C., said Wednesdaythe agency could not comment.   The environmentalists were joined in complaints about theflights last year by the U.S. Forest Service. Air Guard officialschallenged the contentions, saying no military flights are flownbelow 4,500 feet in the area. They also said perhaps 80 percent ofGuard flights over the area were more than 8,000 feet above theground.   Brian O'Neill, a lawyer representing the environmentalists, saidlow-level military flights also are a problem at other wildernessareas and national parks.</TEXT></DOC>
