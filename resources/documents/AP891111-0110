The Shining Path rebel movement has mounted the heaviestoffensive in its nine-year insurgency in an effort to disruptSunday's municipal balloting. The rebels say the violence is thefirst stage in their strategy to block April's presidentialelection.   More than 130 mayors, local judges, clerks, councilmen andmunicipal candidates have been slain this year, and hundreds morehave resigned in fear.   Last month was dubbed ``Red October'' by the Lima press after330 people were killed in fighting and political violence.   Authorities have admitted the government cannot provideprotection to the 4,000-plus mayoral candidates and are worried ahigh percentage of voters may avoid the polls.   `If the Shining Path achieves its objective of preventing votingin a large part of the national territory, it will signify a clearvictory for terror,'' said a high government official, who spoke oncondition he not be identified.   About 10 million people have registered to vote.   The national election board says there are no candidates in 86of Peru's nearly 2,000 municipalities, mostly in rural areas. Butindependent political analysts say the figure is closer to 200.   The guerrillas have concentrated their campaign of terror invillages and small towns. But even in Lima, home to one-third ofPeru's population of 21 million, people are fearful of attacks onelection day.   ``I'm not going to vote, no way. They say the terrorists aregoing to cut off the fingers of people who vote,'' said Antonietade Baron, a 36-year-old homemaker.   Voters must dip their index fingers into purple ink that doesnot wear off for at least a week. In the last presidential electionin 1985, Shining Path rebels cut off the fingers of voters inseveral highland villages.   ``I would rather pay the fine and put up with the problems,''said Mrs. de Baron.   Voting is required by law. Violators face a fine and cannotapply for passports, driver's licenses and other legal documents iftheir voting cards are not stamped.   Bus passengers traveling the Carretera Central, which connectsLima with the central Andes, say rebels have confiscated theirvoter registration cards at roadblocks.   The Carretera Central leads to Junin department, in Peru'smining and farming heartland. The Shining Path has called for athree-day ``armed strike'' there and in the neighboring departmentsof Pasco and Huanuco beginning Sunday.   In May, in a demonstration of the Shining Path's growingstrength, about 1 million people in the three departments obeyedthe group's demand to halt work for three days, cutting allsupplies of food, electric power and mineral exports to Lima on thePacific coast.   On Saturday, the bodies of a high school girl and four otherpeople were found near Ayacucho, police reported. They said all hadbeen tortured and shot in the head.   Police said they did not know the killers and no group claimedresponsibility.   The wave of violence in recent weeks has shifted the focus fromthe candidates and their issues to the ability of the guerrillas todisrupt the voting.   The municipal elections have always been viewed as a testingground for the political parties that participate in the generalelections.   The principal parties contending in the municipal races are theUnited Left, a Marxist-led coalition; and the Democratic Front, acenter-right coalition led by novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who isfavored to win the presidential race.   With Peru suffering from 3,000 percent annual inflation andeconomic chaos, the governing populist Aprista Party is givenlittle chance of winning many mayoral races.   Lima's mayoral race has always been considered a key barometerof political sympathies, and this year a political independent,television showman Ricardo Belmont, is strongly favored to win.   Belmont, who owns a television station and is known for hischaritable telethons and for promoting sporting events, ispromising ``action, not words.'' Analysts say his message is anappeal to voters' disenchantment with Peru's politicians andpolitical parties.   His leading competitor in a field of nine candidates is theDemocratic Front's Juan Inchaustegui, a former Cabinet minister.   Political leaders worry that the public's disenchantment withpolitics makes voters more susceptible to the Shining Path'scampaign against the electoral process.   ``We cannot expect anything good to come from the elections. Onthe contrary, they are only a pretext to defend this rottendemocracy,'' said a Shining Path leaflet distributed in Ayacucho,the highland city where the rebels launched their insurgency in May1980.</TEXT></DOC>
