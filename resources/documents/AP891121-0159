The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, in a 41-page memo datedMonday and made public Tuesday, said concerns raised by ahigher-level regulatory board should not prevent Seabrook fromgetting a full-power operating license.   Using unusually harsh language, the licensing board said Shannonhad raised ``the specter of the deplored `endless loop oflitigation,''' in opposing Seabrook even though Seabrook isentitled to a license.   ``The attorney general of Massachusetts is carrying out hisannounced strategy of filing contentions at every opportunity,''the board wrote, adding that Shannon's ``large staff of assistantswith their fecund word processors can produce motions for renewedlitigation faster than the board and parties can deal with them.''   If the practice is allowed to continue, the board wrote, ``thereis no hope for the Seabrook Station despite applicants' fairly wonvictory.''   Stephen Jonas, Shannon's top deputy handling the Seabrook issue,said the licensing board's decision was based on impatience, notlaw.   ``The thrust of the decision is `We're tired of thislitigation.' There's no legal substance to their arguments,'' Jonassaid. ``They're trying to railroad this thing through.''   The memo comes a week after the board touched off a furor amongSeabrook opponents by ruling that Seabrook should be granted afull-power license despite concerns raised by the Atomic Safety andLicensing Appeal Board. Shannon called the ruling ``lawless.''   Both the licensing and appeal boards are branches of the federalNuclear Regulatory Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
