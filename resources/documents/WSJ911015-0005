LBJ built the Great Society. AndNCK will avenge the Notch Babies.   Nick C. Kratsas, a 72-year-old part-time security guardfrom Youngstown, Ohio, was frustrated by a 1977 adjustment inSocial Security law that he believes gives him and otherpeople born between 1917 and 1921 -- the so-called NotchBabies -- smaller payments than those born before or after.So he did the only logical thing: He formed the Truth andFreedom Party, and declared his candidacy for president ofthe U.S.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kratsas appears to have a more compelling platformthan do some of the 117 other contenders who have so fardeclared their candidacies.   One hopeful, Lloyd O. &quot;Alamo&quot; Scott, of Lubbock, Texas,seeks to oust President Bush, an &quot;intoxicant Republican,&quot; andreturn the land to Prohibition. Kip Lee, a student at ShastaCommunity College in Redding, Calif., promises a bartereconomy and the release of four outer-space aliens, prisonersat the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.   Impressive as they are, neither Mr. Scott nor Mr. Lee hascompiled the solid backing Mr. Kratsas claims. He hasrecruited a retired funeral-home director in Hermitage, Pa.(whom he encountered on his citizens' band radio), to directhis Pennsylvania campaign. He also spent $75 to printposition papers, and he plans future stump speeches.   A deft political operator, Mr. Kratsas realizes he can'twin with Notch Babies alone, particularly since the retireegroups he wrote to for endorsements haven't replied, and hiscampaign coffers remain empty. So he has broadened hisplatform to promise an end to the &quot;clandestine mindmanipulation&quot; found in the background music at Kmarts andsupermarkets.   Mr. Kratsas first ran in 1988, tapping his neighbor, aspeech therapist, as his vice presidential candidate. &quot;Mytheory was I'd run a lady like they did with GeraldineFerraro,&quot; he says. Alas, the tactic worked no better for himthan it did for Walter Mondale. Mr. Kratsas claims he won 260votes; the Federal Elections Commission has no record ofthis.   Mr. Kratsas has dropped the speech therapist this time andwill make his son his running mate. He figures this willassure him the support of employees at the Youngstownaluminum-fabricating plant where his son works. &quot;We'retalking 200, 250 votes for sure,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
