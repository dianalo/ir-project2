Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., and ThomasDaschle, D-S.D., said in a letter to President Bush.   The senators, members of the Senate Select Committee on IndianAffairs, have been conducting special investigative hearings on awide range of problems on reservations and within governmentagencies doing business with them.   Saying they wanted to meet with whomever Bush designates soonafter the appointment, the senators predicted their hearings wouldproduce legislative proposals to correct longtime deficiencies ingovernment policies toward Indians.   In the meantime, they said, a more formal, institutionalizedprocess for coordinating Indian affairs policies could begin at theWhite House.   There was no immediate response from the White House to theletter. Bush was in Japan for the funeral of the late EmperorHirohito.   The senators said testimony before their committee ``raisessignificant concerns about whether the United States is adequatelyfulfilling its fiduciary duties to protect the property rights ofAmerican Indians' rights to land, water, forest, hunting, fishingand mineral resources.   ``As we are sure you will agree, legal representation is at thevery core of the federal government's trust responsibility toAmerican Indians. The inherent conflicts facing the federal trusteearise not only in legal matters, but also in policy decisions.''   They cited as one major shortcoming in U.S. policy PresidentReagan never having appointed anyone to work on Indian affairsdespite establishing a policy of dealing with Indians on a``government-to-government basis'' and promising to fulfill federalresponsibilities to them.</TEXT></DOC>
