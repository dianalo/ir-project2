Dextran sulfate -- used as an anti-coagulant and anti-cholesterol drug in Japan but prohibited in the U.S. -- was tested for eight weeks in San Francisco in 29 patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.    The lead researcher, Donald I Abrams of San Francisco General Hospital, said the patients generally tolerated the drug well and that there was a trend, especially among the healthier patients, toward higher levels of T-helper cells, the immune-system cells killed by the AIDS virus. The attack on the immune system makes various infections fatal to AIDS patients.    He said the drug had no obvious effect on levels of the virus in the blood. Side effects included diarrhea and toxicity to the central nervous system, especially a sense of mental hyperactivity.    These results, modest but encouraging, should lead to an expanded test of the drug, Dr. Abrams said. Nathaniel Pier, a private New York City physician who cares for many patients already taking the drug on their own, was more exuberant: &quot;Dextran is the most exciting new drug. It must continue to be evaluated in scientific studies.&quot;    Another drug, peptide T, also was the subject of a hopeful presentation. T. Peter Bridge, deputy scientific director of the National Institute of Mental Health, said the peptide was non-toxic in a preliminary safety trial in 12 patients. The treatment didn't increase patients' T-helper cells, but there were improvements in motor, neurological and memory functions, and the patients gained weight, Dr. Bridge said. Some conference attendants questioned the study's methodology, however.    Some doctors and patient-advocates at the AIDS conference here said they were disappointed that so few conclusive studies were presented. </TEXT></DOC>
