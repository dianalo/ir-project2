Sondik, a National Cancer Institutespecialist who helped prepare a federal health report on smokingand cancer.   The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control reported Thursdaythat lung cancer deaths increased 15 percent in the United Statesbetween 1979 and 1986, to a rate of about 50 deaths per 100,000people. More men than women die of lung cancer _ about 74 deathsper 100,000 for males in 1986, compared to 27 per 100,000 for women.   But the mortality rate from lung cancer among women is soaringcompared to the rate for men. Between 1979 and 1986, the lungcancer death rate for women jumped 44 percent, while the rate formen was up just 7 percent.   The CDC said male smoking has been on the decline since theearly 1950s, but smoking among women peaked at about 1965. Therecent dropoff in smoking among women _ from 32 percent in 1965 to27 percent in 1987 studies _ isn't nearly as sharp as the drop insmoking by men _ from 50 percent to 32 percent.   ``The men are in a very significant downward trend, while thewomen _ a lot of them were taking up smoking (in the 1950s and'60s),'' Sondik said.   Statistically, the CDC reported, peaks in smoking seem to befollowed by peaks in lung cancer deaths about 35 years later. Morethan eight out of 10 lung cancer deaths are believed to be causedby smoking.   ``The burden of lung cancer and other smoking-related chronicdiseases (such as bronchitis and emphysema) will be substantiallyhigher ... for many decades because of the long latency periodsbetween exposure to tobacco and onset of these diseases,'' the CDCsaid.   That, the agency said, means the death rate from lung canceramong women continues to climb, and will do so until the turn ofthe century or possibly longer, assuming the 35-year lag betweenpeak smoking and peak deaths.   The CDC noted that lung cancer already has passed breast canceras the most common cause of cancer death among women.   While almost half of all Americans who ever took up smoking havequit, the CDC said, more than 50 million people in the UnitedStates continue to smoke.   In 1986, the last year statistics are available, 85,050 men diedof lung cancer in the United States, compared to 40,461 women, theCDC said. Nearly two-thirds of those deaths were people over 65.   The lung cancer death rates are about the same for white femalesand black females _ 27.4 per 100,000 for white women and 26.4 forblack women in 1986. The death rate among males, however, is higherfor blacks, 98.4 to 72.3.   The highest lung cancer death rate among the states in 1986 wasin Alaska, with 148 such deaths for a rate of 70.5 per 100,000people. The lowest was in Utah, with 275 such deaths, or a rate of24.3.</TEXT></DOC>
