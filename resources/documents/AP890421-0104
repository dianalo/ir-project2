(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA on Friday selected LockheedMissile Systems Division of Sunnyvale, Calif., to develop a new,more powerful solid fuel rocket for the space shuttle.   The space agency is moving ahead on the advanced booster despitelast month's recommendation by a congressional safety panel that itdiscontinue the project.   Lockheed estimated total cost of the seven-year developmentproject and facility work at more than $1.1 billion. The company'sprincipal subcontractor is Aerojet Space Booster Co. of Sacramento,Calif., and its facility contractor is Rust International ofBirmingham, Ala.   The contract includes an option for 44 sets of two motors each.The new motor will replace, in the mid-1990s, the current shuttlebooster rocket.   A faulty booster rocket caused the explosion of the shuttleChallenger and loss of its seven-member crew in January 1986. Theshuttle fleet was grounded for 32 months while the rocket wasredesigned.   The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said the new booster shouldnot be built because it would be too costly and would not be asreliable as the existing rocket.   ``We feel there would be an overall degrading of safety,'' saidpanel chairman Joseph Sutter, a retired Boeing executive and amember of the presidential commission that investigated theChallenger accident.   The advanced rocket will enable the shuttle to carry 12,000 morepounds of payload. It currently can lift 50,000 pounds.   New facilities for the rocket development will be constructed atYellow Creek, a site in northeast Mississippi.</TEXT></DOC>
