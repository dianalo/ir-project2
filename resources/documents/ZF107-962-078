GCN: Can you think in Morse code?andM;WILLIAMS: I think so, I really do.andP;  When I was at sea, the only way the Navycommunicated was Morse code.andP;  In rough weather they'd strap you in a chairand the ship would be rolling, but you could get your leg going and starthammering on the hand key.andM;I was the only seaman that was given his own section at that time becauseMorse code apparently was what I was meant to do.andP;  I sure did enjoy it --still do.andM;The Navy made me a communicator.andP;  I wanted to be a radar man.andP;  One of the oldsayings, and I didn't make it up, is that you can always take a communicatorand make him a programmer, but you can't take a programmer and make him acommunicator.andM;When you're in basic training, they give you all these tests.andP;  I took a Morsecode test.andP;  There were 72 possible answers, and I got 71 of them right.andP;  Sothey said, &quot;Guess what?andP;  You're going to be a radio man.&quot;andM;We went from 26 words per minute to 100 words per minute.andP;  That was the oldteletype format.andP;  Oh my, that was modernization at its best.andM;GCN: What was it like here in 1967?andM;WILLIAMS: Had they taken me on a tour [of the Pentagon TelecommunicationsCenter] before I signed on, I would never have come here to work.andP;  In 1967,right at the peak of the Vietam War, it was all manual relay.andP;  The noiselevel alone was an atrocity.andM;We had a roomful of teletype machines.andP;  You could come in here and work asmuch overtime as you wanted to try to keep up with the amount of traffic wewere prcessing.andM;In 1967, we were also making the first transition to being computerized.andP;  Thefirst RCA 3301 computer took up a big room.andP;  It only had 160K of memory.andO;Today my personal computer omes with 512K.andM;For what [the RCA] did, it was one of the best systems for communicationsever designed.andP;  It really was fantastic.andP;  We kept that system a good longtime, I think probably until 1972.andM;Since I've been here, I've seen us go through seven generations of upgrades.andO;We've gone from manual to the RCA 3301 to an IBM System 360/50 to a 360/65,to an Intel AS-5.andM;Now we've got Amdahl 5860s, and we're in the process of doing another upgradebecause message traffic has increased and our processing requirements haveescalated.andM;At that time, this was strictly an Army communications center.andP;  We wereprocessing messages for the Amy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.andM;Back around 1970, there was a very serious incident with a Navy ship, the USSLiberty.andP;  A message that was sent from the Liberty, destined for someplacehere, got mishandled, and people lost their lives.andP;  Congress took a real longlook and said they were tired of every little organization having its ownlittle communications center.andP;  It was time we consolidated.andM;They charged all the services to come back with a plan.andP;  The Army won.andP;  Wealready had an existing communications center.andP;  I think we cut the firstsystem over in 1974.andM;The first real consolidated customer was the Navy.andP;  We actually co-locatedthem up here on the fifth floor.andM;IBM brought in most of the expertise at first, but as time went by the numberof contractors diminished and the number of experts that we had in thegovernment went up.andM;When we were given the mandate, we had everybody else in the MilitaryDistrict of Washington using this system -- State Department, White House,the intelligence commuity, the NATO world, all the embassies.andP;  We still dotoday.andP;  It's a cost savings to them because you don't have to havecommunications centers all through the area.andM;GCN: Is it fee for service?andM;WILLIAMS: No.andP;  The Army pays the bill.andP;  Our fastest line right now isprobably 56,000 bits per second.andP;  So you can say we're transmitting about7,000 characters per second.andM;GCN: Are your lines coaxial?andM;WILLIAMS: There is some coax.andP;  We have not gone fiber optics yet butcertainly that is the next phase.andP;  It's copper right now.andP;  Of course, thereare cryptos and modems on each side of the circuits.andP;  Every piece ofequipment that we have, since we're a top secret system, has to be encryptedor at least go through a protected-wire distribution system.andM;GCN: How many users altogether are on this system?andM;WILLIAMS: Right now, we probably have about 200 individual subscribers thathave circuits.andP;  We break down messages for the Army staff, the Air Forcestaff and so forth.andP;  I don't know how many staff officers they have but we'reproviding hardcopy messages to all those people.andM;The next transition we'll make is that everybody that's anybody has got apersonal computer on their dek.andP;  We want to do away with the ard copy andover-the-counter deliveries and go the electrical route, rather than youhaving to come and knock on my door and say you're here to pick up messages.andM;GCN: Will you use electronic mail?andM;WILLIMAS: That's exactly what we're going to do.andP;  There's a big initiativecalled the Defense Message System, which is supposed to eliminate the needfor these big communications centers.andP;  Writer to reader -- that's what we'redoing.andP;  Rather than go through reams of paper, as you can see in my in-box,I'm going to go over there [to a PC] and look at my messages and work on themthere.andM;GCN: How do you spend your day?andM;WILLIAMS: My day normally is spent trying to manage the system out there, tomake sure that we have good customer relations and put out little fires whenwe get some irate customers, which we do.andM;We're going through a major upgrade right now of our optical characterreaders.andP;  Most people have ordered personal computers and printers with nocorrelation to the communications world.andP;  We have optical character readersthat you read your input messages in from.andP;  Well, we have a little bit of aproblem because messages have to be prepared in a certain font.andM;A lot of these printers do not meet the requirementS, so we're having toadapt and do a lot of coordination so that what they're preparing will beadaptable to what we use.andP;  Slowly but surely, we put out those little fires.andM;GCN: How many people do you oversee?andM;WILLIAMS: Right now this directorate has about 310 people that providecommunications.andP;  Now, that's not all of the Pentagon telecommunicationscenter.andP;  We have one of the biggest directorates in the Information SystemsCommand, Pentagon.andM;We also have the biggest Army data center downstairs, so that's another sideof what we do.andP;  And we now have a Headquarters Army video teleconferencingcapability that ties together the major communications centers and all themajor commands.andM;GCN: What part of your job do you like the last?andM;WILLIAMS: Getting up at five o'clock in the morning.andP;  I really do like myjob.andP;  I guess or me [the hardest part was] making the transition from thetechnical world to management, not being totally involved in the goings-onout there.andP;  Making the transition from being the screw-driver guy.andM;You can look around this hallway and probably come up with about 500 years ofcommunications experience.andP;  It's a dying breed.andM;You don't find that enthusiasm today because we've automated it so much wemade everybody's job a lot easier.andM;You sit in front of a terminal, you don't know why you're pushing the keys.andO;We get a lot of good people today and they're got a lot of talent, but it'sdifferent.andM;Like I say, I've seen it go from the horse and buggy and it's been somethingI never would trade.andM;GCN: Do you feel you were trained or prepared to manage?andP;  Is it something youdo by trial and error?andM;WILLIAMS: Well, some of it.andP;  But knowing the people that I am managing outthere certainly helped.andP;  I've gone to management schools and so forth.andP;  Idon't do that bad a job, but I think that had I been graded on my managerialskills the first year, I probably would have come out with a low grade.andP;  Iwasn't one of the ones that came out of four or six years of college.andP;  Iwalked in from putting my screwdriver down.andM;GCN: You could not have predicted your career?andM;WILLIAMS: When I first walked in here and for years after that, I would neverhave thought I would end up here.andP;  When I heard that the guy that used to sitin here was leaving, I said I want the job.andM;I struggled for a long time to make that transition because I knew I wouldhave to give up calling the shots, and that's what I did for 13 years.andP;  I wastotally involved in all the development and troubleshooting and so forth.andM;GCN: If you could change anything, would you?andM;WILLIAMS: Well, I would definitely say staffing.andP;  The grade structure incommunications is bad.andM;I feel that we perform a very, very critical job.andP;  I came in here as a GS-6and the grades are still the same as they were when I came in.andP;  As a matterof fact, they downgraded our jobs.andP;  And we've done such a good job here.andM;GC: Do you have high turnover because of that?andM;WILLIAMS: Well yeah.andP;  Plus we have a hard time getting qualified peoplebecause they use us as a stepping-stone.andP;  I guess the other thing I see isthat the younger breed want to come in at the top.andP;  Nobody wants to do theirtime in the pits.andP;  Most of us have sweated a lot of good communictions outthere on the floor.andM;GCN: Have you won any honors or awards?andM;WILLIAMS: Oh yes.andP;  Just recently I got a cash award for doing the budget sideof the Pentagon telecommunications coordination.andM;I've gotten some outstanding performance awards.andP;  I got a cash award lastyear for video teleconferencing capabilities.andP;  I've gotten more than 60letters of appreciation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
