Ware, a member of thecorporate research staff of the Rand Corp and board-chairman.andM;&quot;There needs to be a guide to set up requirements because many do it simplyfor political reasons.andP;  The best you can do is a strawman Yellow Book outlineand sell other agencies on the idea,&quot; said Robert H. Courtney, president ofRCI Inc. of Vienna, Va.andM;Courtney said he would draft an initial outline and send it to James H.andO;Burrows, NCSL director, Burrows said his staff would review the draft andsolicit help from other agencies to develop a final product.andM;He acknowledged that agencies need a guide on data integrity, but he warnedthat NIST has limited Resources and could not focus solely on this project.andM;&quot;We do need to turn out something on integrity in terms of what agencies cando now,&quot; Burrows said.andP;  &quot;If we can get a picture of what one should be likewe may be able to get help.andP;  But one agency is not going to be able to fundit.andP;  There are a lot of areas we can't stop working in because of limitedresources.&quot;andM;Meanwhile the board also sent a letter to Sen.andP;  Joseph Biden (D-Del.),andO;chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling for a hearing toeliminate out-of-date technology export restrictions.andP;  The board said theregulations should be revised because they prevent American companies fromselling products abroad simply because they contain rudimentary cryptographicfeatures.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
