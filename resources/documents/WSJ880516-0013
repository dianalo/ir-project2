Analysts are divided on the answer in the wake of last week's stock price tumble. While there's a certain amount of discord over how quickly rates may rise, there's even more disagreement on the potential stock market impact. It looked last week as if investors were fleeing equities in the face of rising rates. But some experts argue that higher rates don't necessarily mean a sick stock market.    Varying estimates of the economy's strength are one reason that stock watchers' views differ. An apparently healthy U.S. economy is running its factories at high operating rates and employing record numbers of workers, raising the specter of inflation. The Federal Reserve Board reined in the economy a bit a week ago when it tightened credit by allowing the rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight to climb above 7%. Consumers and businesses felt the effect when banks translated their higher cost of borrowing into an increased prime rate of 9%.    Usually the impact of higher interest rates on stocks is twofold. First, higher rates make it more costly for companies to do business, raising questions about their ability to produce steady earnings gains. Second, higher rates make bonds an increasingly attractive alternative to stocks.    Many estimates on long-term Treasury bond yields through the remainder of this year range from 9 1/4% to 11% or more, compared with the current level of around 9 1/8%. Yet at least one analyst is arguing that high rates won't necessarily hurt stock prices.    John Paulsen, an economist at Securities Counselors of Iowa Inc., concedes that some people have a hard time squaring his prediction that long-term Treasury yields could hit 11% this year with his recommendation to clients to be fully invested in stocks.    &quot;We're getting a lot of calls from clients asking us how we can be so pessimistic on interest rates but so optimistic on stocks,&quot; said Mr. Paulsen, &quot;but it isn't inconsistent.&quot; He pointed out that since the first part of 1988 interest rates have risen, but so have stock prices. The key, he said, is whether the economy is growing.    &quot;As long as growth is accelerating, and we think it is, the stock market can do well in a higher interest rate environment. It's just that during most of this decade, (economic) growth has been flat and people have seen interest rates rise and stock prices fall.&quot;    But other market professionals indicate they won't be sticking around to see what happens if rates head toward 11%. Although James Wright, chief investment officer at Banc One Asset Management Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, doesn't think rates will hit that level, he said his asset-allocation formula &quot;shows a minimum weighting in stocks at rates as low as 9.5%. At that point the stock market is definitely in trouble.&quot;    Eric Miller, the chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, said stock prices were already reflecting the harmful effects of higher interest rates before last week's interest rate news. And according to him, investors attending a conference sponsored by Donaldson Lufkin indicated they would shed stocks and move toward bonds in a big way if long-term rates went to 10%. He said there's more than a 50% chance that will happen this year, and the stock market will clearly feel the bite.    &quot;The market already reflects assumptions of somewhat higher rates,&quot; he said, &quot;but what hasn't been discounted is the possibility that it could get a lot worse. Rates over 10% haven't been discounted yet.&quot;    Donald Yarling, a partner in the Chicago money management firm of Lemley-Yarling, suggests that the Fed might not tighten the credit reins any further until after the November election, when he expects to see a sharp spike upward in rates. But in the meantime, he said, the stock market could enjoy a steady, albeit modest, gain based on the strength of recent first-quarter earnings reports.    &quot;As long as earnings reports come in as strong as they have, corporate America can certainly live with current long-term interest rates and still be profitable,&quot; he said. &quot;But after the election, I think it starts to turn very hazy.&quot;    ---   Friday Market Activity   Stock prices rebounded from their midweek interest rate rout in thin trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 22.55 at 1990.55. But for the week the average was off 16.91 points. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 147.2 million shares, up from 143.9 million shares Thursday. Advancing issues were ahead of declining issues 1,076 to 446.    Stock prices followed the lead of bonds, which rallied sharply on the news that the April producer price index rose 0.4%, in line with predictions. The April figure offered investors some relief from their worries that inflation is rising rapidly enough to warrant further credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve Board.    Friday's volume, however, continued to indicate that investors are wary of stocks. The volume included more than 29 million shares of two stocks that were the target of investors seeking to capture their high dividend. Niagara Mohawk Power gained 1/8 to 14 5/8 on volume of 25.8 million shares, and Panhandle Eastern slipped 1/8 to 23 7/8 on volume of 3.5 million shares.    Boeing climbed 1 3/8 to 49 3/4. The Wall Street Journal reported that the company appears to have received 80% of a jetliner order exceeding $4 billion that International Lease Finance plans to announce next week. The order would be the largest ever. Sources told the Journal that Airbus Industrie received the rest, while General Electric would supply the engines. GE rose 3/8 to 39 3/8.    Among other blue-chip stocks, International Business Machines gained 1 5/8 to 110 3/8, General Motors rose 2 1/4 to 75 1/4, F.W. Woolworth was up 1 1/8 to 52 7/8, and Du Pont closed at 83, up 2.    Pillsbury rose 1 1/8 to 39 5/8. The company was rumored to once again be the focus of takeover speculation. Among possible suitors mentioned were Volvo of Sweden and Donald Kelly, a U.S. food industry executive.    Money center banks extended their gains. Citicorp rose 1/2 to 21 5/8, Chase Manhattan climbed 3/8 to 21 1/2, and J.P. Morgan closed up 3/4 at 33 3/8. </TEXT></DOC>
