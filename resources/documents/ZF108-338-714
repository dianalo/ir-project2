Siemens is more circumspect, saying only that it is already offeringOSF/Motif with its Sinix Unix.andM;- o -andM;Hitachi Ltd, &quot;eager to remain ahead of the times, incorporates the OpenSoftware Foundation's offerings into its product development process andintroduces OSF/1 and OSF/Motif as the mainstream of its open systemsproducts, ranging from workstations to supercomputers&quot;, it says, adding thatimplementation is already under way, and programmes to support independentsoftware vendors and users are in place.andM;- o -andM;The plunge in the Tokyo stock market reflects growing worries that all is notas well as it has been in the Japanese economy, and Sony Corp has announcedthat it is battening the hatches: having increased capital investment by inexcess of 10% in each of the past three fiscal years, it says it intends tohold the figure steady this year at around $1,900m or so.andM;- o -andM;Go Corp, developing a stylus-driven laptop computer called the Slate inFoster City, California is tipped to get financing from IBM and access toIBM's handwriting recognition technology according to PC Week: IBM may alsomarket the machines to large accounts when they appear; VisiCalc spreadsheetdeveloper Dan Bricklin has started a new company specifically to developapplications for the new machine, which will take on Dr Hermann Hauser'sAcorn RISC Machine-based Active Book box.andM;- o -andM;AsiaSat 1 took the long march to the skies on China's Long March III rocketon Saturday: the satellite is jointly owned by Cable andamp; Wireless Plc,Hutchison Whampoa Ltd and China International Trust andamp; Investment Co, and isintended to provide both telecommunications links and television across Asia.andM;- o -andM;Subscribers with long memories will recall that this is not the first timethat AsiaSat 1 has taken to the skies: last time, it bore the Westar VIcolours and did not achieve its correct orbit; it was one of two errantsatellites retrieved from space by the NASA Shuttle and Cable andamp; Wireless Plcbought it from the insurers, Lloyds of London, which had already paid out onit; it has since been refurbished by General Motors Corp's Hughes Aircraftunit for its long march.andM;- o -andM;Legent Corp, Vienna, Virginia successor company to Morino Associates andDuquesne Systems, warns that its results for the second quarter to March 31will not meet analysts' projections, mainly because of disappointing newlicence sales of its IS Management software products in North America: whilenew sales in total climbed about 29% for the quarter to about $23m, in NorthAmerican they fell about 20% form the like quarter a year ago so that fiscal1990 second period net profits will be about $7.5m on total sales growth of25% to about $40m - 35 cents a share where analysts had been looking for 40cents or more;

there are stand-alone, server and nodeeditions of 1-2-3 Release 3 available for Sun's Sparc, Motorola andIntel-based systems; other Unix 1-2-3s are planned for other Sparcs then forother Unix versions; running under the SunView X Windowing environment, Sunversions use core 1-2-3 v3 code re-written in C, are compatible with MS-DOSversions and use the same interface; at the same time Frontline announced anagreement under which it will market Sun's desktop and low-end serversystems; Lotus 1-2-3 for Sun is #550 stand-alone, #800 for a server edition,and #400 for the node version; it needs SunOS 4.0 or higher, 4Mb of RAM and5Mb of disk.andM;- o -andM;Correction: at the interim stage Synapse Computer Services Plc made a pre-taxloss of #249,200 versus a profit of #463,100 - net figures were a loss of#249,200 against a prior of #301,000 (CI No 1,403).andM;- o -andM;Noticed how communications products have suddenly become connectivityproducts (not in Computergram they haven't - Ed)? We assume that the word wasfirst coined by some manufacturer that wanted to fudge the fact that hiscommunications product achieved very little and was picked up by others sopassee they wanted to sound with-it, because we can think of few more idealconnectivity devices than a piece of string, whereas to describe something asa communications product implies rather more than that it simply ties twothings together - but the passion for coining unhelpful new terms runsunabated in the computer industry, and the Financial Times relates that avisitor to a US-run research station admired the splendid windows in thecomputer suite, only to be told coldly, &quot;Those aren't windows, they'reenvironment awareness panels,&quot; - soon to be cut to EAPs, no doubt.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
