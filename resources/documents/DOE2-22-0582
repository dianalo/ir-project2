In most of these countries,the impact on economic growth is negative. Limitation on availabilityof capital and foreign exchange becomes a major constraint in successfulimplementation of national development plans. The Republic of the Philippinesis a case in point. The Philippines imports all of its petroleum needs,and substitution of oil by indigenous coal or coal-derived fuels is amajor national goal. Moreover, oil-importing developing countries donot necessarily receive the benefits of falling world oil prices. Theypurchase oil in U.S. dollars, and the U.S. dollar is strong against practicallyall currencies. For example, early in 1983 at the time Philippine interestin coal-water-mix fuel technology began, a barrel of imported oil costabout 250 pesos. Today, this same barrel costs about 560 pesos, morethan doubling in a two-year period. This dramatic rise in the local costof oil in a short time frame has contributed in large measure to themore than doubling of the wholesale price index in the Philippines overthe same period. Whether or not oil prices resume their rise, the negativeimpact of imported oil on economic growth in the developing countriesis likely to continue.</TEXT></DOC>
