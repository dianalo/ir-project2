The scientist declined to discuss the circumstances that led himto return Wednesday as director and chief executive of the museum.   His secretary told The Associated Press that Leakey was back inhis office today, but ``says he doesn't want to talk to the press.''   Leakey, 45, son of the late anthropologist Louis Leakey, hadheaded the National Museums of Kenya for 20 years when he resignedJan. 20.   At that time, Leakey said the Ministry of Home Affairs hadappointed a new board of trustees for the museum withoutconsultations, and that he was helping carry out the ministry's``reorganization.''   The museum houses Africa's best collection of fossils and humanartifacts. The ministry on Jan. 27 issued a statement reinstatingthe disbanded board, on which Leakey had served as secretary. Theministry did not mention its earlier action.   Leakey on Sunday told The Associated Press he was waiting for theold board to reconvene and formally offer him his job back.   ``Until then I'll stay in my shamba (farm),'' he said.   Last month, a Nairobi newspaper, The Standard, quotedunidentified museum employees as blaming Leakey for an exodus ofAfrican scientists from the institution, which has a staff of 300.Museum employees later signed a public letter defending theirdirector.   Leakey, a Kenya citizen, is a high school dropout who learnedanthropology at the knees of his parents, Louis and Mary, pioneersin the discipline.   In 1972, at age 27, Leakey found a skull of a man-like creaturewhile leading an expedition near Lake Turkana in northwestern Kenya.   The skull was later established to be 2.5 million or more yearsold, pushing mankind's family back at least a million years. Theskull is known simply as 1470, its catalogue number in the Kenyanmuseum.   Until Richard's 1972 discovery, the oldest precusor of man wasthought to date 1.5 million years. It was represented by a skullfound by Louis Leakey 14 years earlier in northern Tanzania anddubbed homo habilis, or handy man.</TEXT></DOC>
