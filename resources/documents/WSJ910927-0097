That award, which is being touted as the largest amountever awarded in the U.S. in a sex-discrimination case, couldgrow. The jury is expected to decide today on punitivedamages, which are designed to punish a defendant forreckless or intentional wrongdoing.</LP><TEXT>   The suit had been pending since 1986, when Janella SueMartin, 48 years old, sued the oil company, which is based inWhite Plains, N.Y. Ms. Martin, who still works for Texaco aswestern region credit supervisor, claimed that she had beenpassed over for promotion two times in favor of men.   Texaco says it plans to appeal the decision. A companyspokeswoman said the oil giant was &quot;disappointed&quot; by theverdict, which ran &quot;contrary to the facts of the case and thelaw.&quot;   The award must still be approved by state Superior CourtJudge Ronald Cappai. The judge could sharply reduce theamount of the award, which several labor attorneys labeled as&quot;excessive&quot; with regard to one individual.   Indeed, only $287,000 is related to economic damages, saidan individual familiar with the case. The remainder of theaward is related to noneconomic factors, such as emotionalstress. Ms. Martin claimed she suffered emotionally after menwere given the higher paying jobs she was vying for.   In one instance, Ms. Martin alleged in her suit that in1984 she transferred from Houston to her current job in LosAngeles after being promised a promotion to manager when thatposition opened.   However, one year later, a man with &quot;lesser skills . . .and experience&quot; was promoted to manager, according to thecomplaint. Ms. Martin claimed in the suit that Texacosuperiors had told her that her job performance was&quot;excellent&quot; and that she was a &quot;highly skilled and qualifiedemployee.&quot; She claimed that she never received a formalwritten reprimand nor was she placed on probation whileworking at Texaco.   Texaco declined to elaborate on details of the case forlegal reasons. A mistrial of the case was declared lastAugust when jurors heard accounts of it on a radio.   ---   PUBLICATION RIGHTS of researchers prevail over governmentban.   The federal government cannot prevent universityprofessors from publishing preliminary results ofgovernment-funded studies, a federal judge ruled.   The decision by federal trial Judge Harold H. Greene inWashington, D.C., struck down a Department of Health andHuman Services regulation that allowed the agency to reviewand censor the work of government grant recipients. Theregulation had gone unchallenged for seven years untilStanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., filed a lawsuitarguing that the regulation violated the free speech rightsof researchers to share their preliminary findings with thepublic and other scientists.   Last year, HHS and the National Institutes of Healthoffered Stanford University a $1.5 million, five-yearcontract to do research on artificial heart devices.Stanford, however, said it wouldn't abide by the contract'sconfidentiality clause. The contract was granted to St. LouisUniversity, another bidder. Stanford sued.   The U.S. Justice Department, which argued for thegovernment, contended that the regulation was necessary toprevent recipients from releasing preliminary unvalidatedfindings that &quot;could create erroneous conclusions which mightthreaten public health or safety if acted upon,&quot; the opinionsaid.   In the opinion, Judge Greene said the regulation was animpermissible prior restraint on free speech that would &quot;bean invitation to government censorship wherever public fundsflow . . .&quot; Judge Greene ordered that the NIH give thecontract back to Stanford.   A spokesman for the Justice Department said it hasn'tdecided whether it will appeal the decision.   Iris Brest, Stanford's associate general counsel, said thedecision upheld free speech rights and scientific ethicsbecause &quot;you need people to publish results so they can beexamined by others.&quot;   ---   GERBER BABY spawns a trademark infringement lawsuit.   Baby food giant Gerber Products Co. sued rival RalstonPurina Co. for using the photograph of an infant -- whoallegedly looked similar to the famous Gerber baby -- onbottles of a new bottled water for infants.   The suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattanyesterday, alleges that Ralston's Beechnut baby food unitviolated trademark laws with the baby's visage. Gerber, basedin Fremont, Mich., says the infant looks strikingly like theone it has used in its labeling since the early 1930s.   Beechnut uses a four-color photo of a baby in a circle;Gerber uses a drawing of a baby, also in a circle.   Gerber says Ralston's Beechnut unit is positioning bottlesof its new Baby's First spring water in the infant-formulasection of supermarkets. Unlike Gerber, Beechnut doesn't makea formula product.   In addition to an injunction preventing further use of theface, Gerber asked for all labels and packaging alreadyprinted to be sent to Gerber for destruction. Gerber also isseeking unspecified triple damages.   A spokesman for St. Louis-based Ralston said the companyhadn't seen the suit but typically doesn't comment on legalproceedings until they are concluded.   ---   PRO BONO WORK reported by more than half of New York Statelawyers.   A survey of 3,500 attorneys, mandated by New York StateChief Judge Sol Wachtler, will help him decide whether torequire that all lawyers licensed in the state provide freelegal service on behalf of the poor and not-for-profitorganizations.   The survey, released this week, found that 57% of alllawyers, active and retired, performed some kind oflaw-related pro bono work. But only 39.8% reported that suchwork was for poor clients or organizations that serve theirneeds.   The survey also revealed that only about 28% of those whodo pro bono work perform more than 20 hours a year. A fargreater percentage of attorneys in the state's rural countiesreported providing free legal aid than those in urbancenters. In Manhattan, home to some of the nation's largestand most profitable law firms, 42% of attorneys surveyedreported doing some pro bono work in 1990.   Judge Wachtler organized the survey after a courtcommittee last year recommended that pro bono work berequired of New York lawyers. He hasn't decided whether toaccept that committee's recommendation. He will conduct asecond survey in a year to see if the number of lawyers doingsuch work increases through voluntary efforts that he willencourage.   &quot;The numbers are a little higher than we expected. It'slittle, little surprise, a pleasant surprise, but still farshort of what's necessary,&quot; said Victor Marrero, a partner inthe New York law firm Brown andamp; Wood, who was in charge of thesurvey and who chaired the committee that had recommendedmaking pro bono work mandatory.   Some private lawyers said the survey supports requiringlawyers to provide free legal aid. &quot;After discussions aboutthe need to do more pro bono, activity always increases,&quot;said Alexander D. Forger, chairman of the New York firmMilbank, Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy and chairman of the Legal AidSociety in New York City. &quot;It's part of lawyers'responsibility to make the justice system work.&quot;   But some public-interest attorneys and legal ethicsspecialists warned that making such work mandatory mightaffect the quality of the legal services. &quot;If you force laboron lawyers, as with anyone else, you're likely going to getwhat you pay for,&quot; said Monroe Freedman, a professor on legalethics at Hofstra University Law School.   ---   CONSERVATIVES OPPOSE expected choice for environmentalpost.   The Washington Legal Foundation, a right-leaning thinktank, is trying to shoot down President Bush's choice to headthe Justice Department's environmental division -- before thepresident even announces it.   James Benkard, the strong favorite to be named assistantattorney general, &quot;is no good at all,&quot; says the legalfoundation's Alan Slobodin. Some business advocates haveattacked the environmental division for its criminalindictment of Exxon Corp. and stepped-up corporateprosecutions generally.   Among conservatives' objections to Mr. Benkard is that heis a board member of the Environmental Defense Fund and hassupervised the group's litigation. Justice Departmentofficials say the expected Benkard nomination, which wouldrequire Senate confirmation, isn't in dire trouble. Mr.Benkard, who is a partner in New York with Davis Polk andamp;Wardwell, declined to comment.   ---   FEDERAL CRIMINAL CASE filings decline for the first timein a decade.   Criminal prosecutions in federal trial courts declined forthe first time in a decade in the 12 months ended last June30, according to a report from the Administrative Office ofthe U.S. Courts. The number of civil filings in federalcourts also dropped, continuing a trend that began in 1986,the administrative office said.   A decrease in drug cases in southern Texas was a majorfactor in shrinking the federal criminal docket. Restrictionson federal jurisdiction continued to limit the civil docket.The caseload in federal bankruptcy courts continued to growrapidly, as it has every year since 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
