The U.S. Supreme Court's rejection this past week of the lastchallenge to Manville's reorganization plan virtually assures itsemergence from ``the wind tunnel,'' as Tom Stephens, chiefexecutive officer, describes the company's six-year Chapter 11odyssey.   Without explanation, the Supreme Court turned down the challengeby MacArthur Co., a Minneapolis company that for years distributedManville asbestos products.   MacArthur has 25 days to seek a second Supreme Court review, buthas not indicated whether it will. If the company waives a secondreview, Manville would have just 30 days of legal requirementsbefore it could emerge from Chapter 11 reorganization.   ``It's a day we've worked for for a long, long time,'' saidStephens, who has guided Manville through the last two years ofreorganization.   When Manville filed for Chapter 11 protection on Aug. 26, 1982,it was being deluged with asbestos injury and property-damagelawsuits at a rate of 400 a month. By 1986, property damage claimsalone had come to a staggering $85 billion, or about 40 times thecompany's total assets. The company also faced more than 17,000personal injury claims in the billions of dollars.   The Chapter 11 filing allowed Manville to operate in aninterest-free environment safe from the mounting injury and damageclaims and to draft a more than $2.5 billion trust-fund plan to payasbestos victims.   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved Manville's reorganizationclaims payment plan in December 1986, but challenges have delayedits implementation.   Now, with the last hurdle nearly behind it, a refitted Manvilleis poised to begin operation free of court protection andsupervision.   The reorganization plan has been praised and pilloried.   Phillip Schaeffer, a bankruptcy specialist with the investmentfirm Cowen andamp; Co., described it as ``a work of art, a stunninglymagnificent document.''   Calvert Crary, a litigation analyst with Martin Simpson andamp; Co., aNew York investment research firm, said Manville shareholders willbe big losers. They will see their stake diluted, winding up withone share of new Manville stock for every eight shares they holdtoday.   ``Basically, they wiped out their shareholders,'' said Crary.``I'm disgusted with the way Manville conducted itself. It's beenguilty of a gross abdication of fiduciary responsibility toshareholders.''   Stephens, however, said the plan protects shareholders while atthe same time addressing the asbestos claims problem.   ``To all those who said the filing was inappropriate, I thinkthe $2.6 billion is testimony to the fact that Manville has dealteffectively with the problem,'' he said following the Supreme Courtruling.   Schaeffer said the plan will help Manville remain a financiallyand operationally healthy company.   ``Even assuming a mild recession, the recent cost-cuttingmeasures that Manville has undertaken _ the elimination oflow-profit or no-profit businesses and the acquisition ofhigh-profit businesses _ will allow Manville significant cash flowand profitability in the future,'' he said.   The reorganization plan calls for establishment of a PersonalInjury Settlement Trust, to settle claims of asbestos healthvictims for the next 25 years. Manville already has paid $150million into the trust, and its insurers will pay another $615million immediately. Beginning in 1991, Manville will make annualpayments to the trust of $75 million until 2012.   A second trust, called the Property Damage Settlement Trust,would settle asbestos-related property claims. Manville isobligated to pay $100 million cash immediately to this trust, andthe company's insurance carriers also will contribute millions ofdollars.   In addition, Manville faces immediate cash obligations of $247.5million to commercial creditors once it emerges from bankruptcyproceedings.   The Supreme Court's ruling brings the plan closer toimplementation for thousands of asbestos victims around the nation.   ``I am praying that this is the end of the road for us,'' saidHeather Maurer, executive director of Asbestos Victims of America,based in Soquel, Calif. The group has more than 13,000 membersacross the country.   While some analysts question whether the trust payments willdrain the company's cash flow and profits over the next quartercentury, others say the payments are arranged so that Manville mayjuggle its trust-payment obligations while continuing to expand.   Manville, which made a $164 million profit on $2.06 billion insales last year, today consists of three parts: a Fiber GlassGroup, which produces insulation products and glass fibers; aForest Products Group, producing wood and paper products, and aSpecialty Products Group, making diverse goods ranging fromcommercial-industrial lighting to filter materials for the beer andwine industries.   ``The fascinating part of the bankruptcy is that we've designeda $2 billion company from scratch,'' said Stephens.   He said the reorganized Manville is a blend of maturebusinesses, such as fiberglass and forest products, and growthbusinesses, in its Specialty Products Group.   ``To optimize the value for shareholders, what you like to do ishave growth and maturity,'' he said. ``If you just have growth withno cash flow, then you tend to leverage. And then when things gobad, negative leverage will kill you.   ``So, it's like a sonata. It's a carefully orchestratedbalance.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
