The ruling follows a complaint filed by Hyster Co. -- a forklift-truck concern and unit of Portland, Ore.-based Esco Corp. -- and several trade unions against the imports. If the department issues a final ruling against the imports, and the U.S. International Trade Commission rules that the imports have injured or &quot;threaten injury&quot; to U.S. manufacturers, the U.S. can assess penalty duties against them.    The commission, in an earlier preliminary ruling, found that the imports may be harming a domestic industry. Final rulings by the two agencies are expected early next year.    If penalty duties are imposed, they would equal the &quot;dumping price margins&quot; -- the amount by which the &quot;home-market&quot; price or cost of production of the goods exceeds the price charged for them in the U.S. In its preliminary ruling, the department calculated that these margins ranged as high as 56.8% for Kasagi Fork Lift Inc.    Other suppliers found to have been dumping included Toyota Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co., Komatsu Forklift Co., Toyo Umpanki Co., and Sanki Industrial Co.    The imports supplied by all Japanese companies last year totaled about $235.7 million, the agency said.    The preliminary anti-dumping act decision was issued while Commerce Secretary William Verity was in Japan to meet with Japanese government leaders on trade issues.    Earlier this week, Mr. Verity said he expects U.S. companies and trade unions to file a growing number of anti-dumping complaints against Japanese manufacturers because many companies in Japan haven't adjusted their export prices upward to reflect the appreciation of the Japanese yen. </TEXT></DOC>
