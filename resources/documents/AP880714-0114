WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk said todaythat Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis had spoken within the last24 hours, and that two campaigns were continuing to talk althoughplatform negotiations remain broken off.   ``I know there has been a conversation between the twocandidates and several conversations between the two campaigns,''Kirk said. ``So I think we'll be moving forward to make sure thereare continuing discussions and hopefully we'll be able to resolveany differences on substantive matters.''   A day earlier, Jackson's convention manager, Ron Brown,disappointed over Dukakis' selection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for hisrunning mate and angered that Jackson learned of the selection fromthe press, said the campaign had broken off talks over 13 stilldisputed platform issues.   Asked if there are ongoing talks about the platform, Kirk said:``At this moment there are not. The effort between the twocampaigns is to assure there will be.''   He said Dukakis called Jackson ``within the last 24 hours.''   He said Dukakis wanted ``to make sure that anymisunderstandings'' about how Jackson was informed of the decisionwere resolved. ``I think it's ... just one of those matters oftiming and certainly wasn't intended as a signal of disrespect orinsensitivity,'' the chairman said.   Kirk said he spoke with Jackson to explain his own role inintroducing Dukakis and Bentsen and the press conference announcingBentsen's selection in Boston on Tuesday, when Kirk presented themas the 1988 party ticket.   ``I talked with Jackson about that myself and I said the numberswere clear in terms of the presidential nomination, the choice hadbeen made with respect to the vice presidential nomination, thatthe party was anxious to direct its attention and its effortagainst the Republicans in November without in any way turning ourback on the important contribution Rev. Jackson has and willcontinue to make to that effort.   He cited ``the reality of the numbers'' and added, ``I thinkit's important for me and my role to continue to keep the focus onthe November election. ... The quicker all of us can close ranksand button up the unified Democratic Party, I think it's in thegreater interest of succeeding in the fall.''   Kirk said Jackson listened and added, ``He might have had adifferent point of view.''   Kirk also announced the addition of four speakers to theconvention program: Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., on defense and nationalsecurity issues; Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., on keeping a Senatemajority; Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia, representing theDemocratic governors; and Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., on the role ofthe presidency.</TEXT></DOC>
