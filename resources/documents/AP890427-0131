Gude, a Washington businesswoman who servesas secretary of the National Association of the Partners of theAmericas, a group that aimes to foster cooperation among thenations in the Western Hemisphere.   She said health workers in Latin America are used to making dowith little money and to dealing with poor people.   She cited a card that Brazilian communities give new mothers tokeep track of their children's weight and vaccinations. Babies whodie soon after birth are often underweight.   ``A simple device like this has made a big impact on educationalprograms in other countries and we believe it can help us reduceour own infant mortality rates here in the states,'' she said.   Ms. Gude and others testified to the House committee on hunger.   Dr. Norbert Hirschhorn testified in favor of the cure nowwidespread in poor countries for diarrhea in babies: a simplemixture of water, sugar or glucose and salt that can be drunk.   Such an oral rehydration treatment using ``rice powder in placeof glucose is palatable and helps slow diarrhea,'' he said.   He said the standard U.S. treatment for dehydration, the loss ofbody fluids, is to give replacement fluids intravenously. But thistreatment is expensive and not always available outside hospitals.   Hirschhorn is vice president of John Snow, Inc. a consultingfirm.   Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., chairman of the committee's domestictask force, said diarrhea annually kills about 500 Americanchildren under age five. Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, chairman ofthe committee, estimated that oral rehydration saves 750,000 to amillion lives every year in the Third World.   Dr. Stanley Foster said the United States could learn from othercountries about immunizing pre-school children against measles andwhooping cough.   ``Coverage for measles'' for children under age two in somelarge U.S. metropolitan areas ``has been documented to be as low as49 percent,'' he testified.   ``This is lower than in many nations of the developing world....''   Dr. Foster directs the field services division of the U.S.government's International Health Program Office.   Dr. Sandra Huffman, president of the Center to Prevent ChildhoodMalnutrition, said that breast feeding is less common in the UnitedStates than in Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands or Australia.   ``The United States has far to go if we are to catch up withbreast-feeding rates in those developed countries, all of whichhave lower infant mortality rates than the United Statses,'' shetestified.</TEXT></DOC>
