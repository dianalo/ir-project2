The House Government Operations transportation subcommitteestaff memo says Pan Am documents indicate that Christmas holidaytraffic for U.S. embassy personnel had been heavily re-bookedbefore the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270people.   Relatives of those who died in the bombing have been angry thata U.S. Federal Aviation Administration warning of a possiblebombing of a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt, West Germany to theUnited States was not made public. They say diplomats would haveacted on the warnings and canceled Pan Am flights.   The subcommittee memo, made available to The Associated Press,notes that Pan Am has denied that there were any threats aimedspecifically at Flight 103 in the two weeks before the bombing.   According to the memo, one of the Pan Am documents, barelylegible, says: ``Of course, we are telling pax (passengers) of PAsecurity measures FRA (Frankfurt).''   Another document involves a request ``for public informationguidelines in view that about 80 percent of holiday traffic ofembassy is rebooking.''   But there is no further explanation of that statement, nor isthere any indication that the rebookings specifically involvedFlight 103. The statement does not say which U.S. embassy is meant.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said there was``no basis at all for the allegation that the U.S. Department ofState officials systematically canceled reservations on Flight 103based on the FAA aviation security bulletin.''   ``There is no evidence whatsoever of any systematic pattern ofcanceled reservations for this flight by anyone or any group,'' Ms.Tutwiler said.   But when asked if she had any information on whethercancellations had occurred involving other flights, Ms. Tutwilersaid she could not immediately answer that question.   In New York, Jeff Kriendler, vice president of corporatecommunications for Pan Am, when asked if there had been largenumbers of diplomats canceling flights on Pan Am, said, ``There isno indication that that was the case.''   In Albany, N.Y., Paul Hudson, chairman of Victims of Flight 103,said, ``We knew that diplomats had information regarding thethreats to Pan Am Flight 103. We are outraged at the cover-up andapparent lies of the State Department.''   ``We have felt from the beginning that government officials wereinformed of the terrorists' threats and were able to change theirtravel plans,'' said Hudson.   The subcommittee has asked Pan Am for all internal documentsrelating to security measures, to threats about Flight 103, andinformation about who in Pan Am knew about any such threats.   Contents of the March 13 subcommittee memo were first reportedby a London newspaper, The Independent. The memo says Pan Am shouldbe asked to provide details of lost revenue ``since Pan Am wasobviously keeping track of threat-related cancellations.'''   The Federal Aviation Administration warning was prepared afteran anonymous caller to the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland said abomb attack would be made in the two weeks after Dec. 5. The FAAbulletin was sent to embassies so they could inform foreigngovernments.   Since the bombing of the New York-bound Boeing 747 overLockerbie, the United States and the Finnish police have maintainedthat the telephoned warning was a hoax.   Relatives of those who died on Flight 103 have maintained it wasinevitable that diplomats would act on the bulletin, warningfriends and relatives and canceling Pan Am reservations.   On April 7, Clayton McManaway, the U.S. ambassador-at-large forcounterterrorism, told the Senate: ``That is not true.''   McManaway pointed out then that 31 U.S. government personneldied in the bombing. He said the decision of the U.S. Embassy inMoscow to post copies of the warning was not in accordance withU.S. government policy.</TEXT></DOC>
