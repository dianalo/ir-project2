McDermott, who has been executive vice president in charge of Bausch andamp; Lomb Inc.'s U.S. operations, was elected president and chief operating officer of the vision care and instruments maker.    In his new positions, Mr. McDermott, 50 years old, will have responsibility for the company's professional eye care, health care, consumer and scientific products businesses world-wide.    As president, he succeeds Daniel E. Gill, 50, who continues as chairman and chief executive officer. The chief operating officer's post is new at Bausch andamp; Lomb.    The company said no one will succeed Mr. McDermott as executive vice president.    A Bausch andamp; Lomb director, Mr. McDermott has directed the company's domestic operations since August 1985. He presided over the divestiture of the company's industrial instruments business, before being appointed group president, consumer and scientific products, in January 1985.    Mr. Gill said the organizational change was necessary because the company's restructuring and acquisition programs have created &quot;a more dynamic and diversified company.&quot; The new structure will enable Bausch andamp; Lomb to focus on day-to-day operational issues as well as on strategic planning and the development of long-term business opportunities, he said.    Separately, Bausch andamp; Lomb named Jay T. Holmes, 44, senior vice president, corporate affairs and secretary, as a director, increasing board membership to 13.    It also named two new vice presidents. Bausch andamp; Lomb said James P. Greenawalt, 36, becomes vice president, human resources. He previously held that position at the company's Personal Products and Professional Products divisions. Also named as vice president was Carl E. Sassano, 35, who has been president of Bausch andamp; Lomb's Polymer Technology Corp. subsidiary. </TEXT></DOC>
