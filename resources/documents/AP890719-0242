Boss said his company predicted the downturn last year anddoesn't expect an end until the second quarter of 1990. Manysemiconductor companies will experience negative growth through thenext two quarters, he said.   Intel on Tuesday reported its second-quarter earnings fell to $99million, or 53 cents a share, from $130 million, or 73 cents ashare, in the same period last year. Revenue rose 3 percent to $747million. Intel's stock finished the day down $2.50 at $28.87{.   The company's report followed an earnings and sales declinereported by Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale last week andindications by a key industry economic gauge that orders may begradually slowing.   Second-quarter earnings by AMD fell by more than half while salesfell 11 percent. Jerry Sanders, AMD's chief executive, predictedrevenues will remain flat for the rest of the year.   While the industry's ``book-to-bill'' ratio released last weekfor the month of June reached an all-time high, the order ratesuggested the industry may slow down gradually later this year. Theratio measures orders vs. shipments.   June's 1.6 percent increase in orders was below the average 3.1percent increase over the past 10 years, according to ThomasThornhill, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in SanFrancisco.   Some analysts think the apparent slowdown will be short-lived,and is likely a strong seasonal drop.   Analyst Mel Phelps with Hambrecht andamp; Quist in San Francisco saidIntel's earning were partially hurt by a $17 million charge due to aplanned factory shutdown, and without it, earnings per share wouldhave climbed another 7 cents, he said.   The company took the charge to cover costs associated with the1990 planned shutdown of a wafer fabrication plant in Livermore. Thecompany is attempting to transfer the plant's 400 workers to otherlocations.   Phelps anticipates strong Intel sales through the end of theyear, partially because of the introduction of new microproccessorproducts, and total revenues of $3.1 billion, compared with $2.8billion last year.   Analyst Michael Stark of Robertson, Stephens andamp; Co. in SanFrancisco said Intel's report was the sign of at least a summerslowdown. He expects it to be short-lived, and for sales to continuestrong growth through the rest of the year, although not by as muchas he would like.   ``It's raised a flag of caution in some people's minds; We reallydon't think it's more .... but it's clearly the full brunt of aseasonal weakening,'' he said.   But analyst Rick Whittington of Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. in New Yorksaid the industry was heading into a ``quasi-recession or even anabsolute recession.''   Whittington, who has been advising clients to sell Intel stockfor the last six weeks, said Intel's introduction of the newmicroproccesors ``strategically makes sense, but they run the riskin the short term of experiencing a classic downturn and as theyshift gears they could be blasted away with margins really sharply.''   Intel said new orders received for advanced microprocessors werestrong, continuing a recovery from an inventory correction thatoccurred in the fourth quarter of 1988. Second-quarter orders alsowere higher than those in the first.   Dataquest's Boss said that because of the relative strength ofthe year's first two quarters, the worldwide and North Americansemiconductor markets will end the year with about 15 percentgrowth, compared with 34 percent in 1988. Next year should see flatgrowth, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
