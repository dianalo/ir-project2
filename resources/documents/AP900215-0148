However, a leading animal rights group said it wantscorporations to release internal information to back up thefindings.   ``I would challenge the companies to substantiate the claimsthat the numbers are down,'' said Susan Rich, special projectsdirector for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, thenation's largest animal rights group.   ``By looking at the figures of animal use in their in-houselaboratories does not give us the true picture,'' Rich said.   The report by the Investor Responsibility Research Centerexamines data submitted to the Agriculture Department by U.S.companies reporting animal use in fiscal years 1986, 1987 and 1988.   It also offers in-depth profiles of animal testing from 1984-88of nine companies that introduced shareholder resolutions on animaltesting after being targeted by PETA.   The study shows six of nine companies targeted by PETA cutanimal testing by 42 percent from 1986-88.   Two of the companies _ Avon and Greyhound _ say they no longeruse animal testing for cosmetic and household product research, thereport said.   Other companies highlighted in the study were American HomeProducts, Bristol-Myers Products, Colgate-Palmolive, Gillette,Johnson andamp; Johnson, Proctor andamp; Gamble and Schering-Plough, whichproduces Maybelline cosmetics.   Only American Home Products showed no reduction in animaltesting during the period. Bristol-Myers had an increase from 597to 743 tests between 1987 and 1988 after an earlier decline.   The study said Gillette closed its in-house laboratory in March1987 and declined to reveal how many animals have been used intesting by contracted outside labs in 1988. Figures for 1988 alsowere unavailable for Schering-Plough.   ``We have not increased the number of animals just to increasethe animals,'' said Carol Emerling, spokeswoman for American HomeProducts. ``The kinds of drugs and number of drugs that we'retesting dictates the amount of testing that we do.''   She said most of the company's testing is for pharmaceuticalproducts where she said elimination of animal testing is not likely.   The study said companies are turning to non-animal methods oftesting.   Heidi Welsh, author of the IRRC study, said USDA reportingrequirements don't cover ``rats and mice _ an estimated 80 to 90percent of all animal use _ and do not include animals uses atcontract laboratories.''   Consumer product testing studied by IRRC included toxicitytesting of non-medical-related cosmetic and household products suchas soaps and eyeshadow.   Over-the-counter and prescription drug testing was not included.   Cosmetic and household testing account for ``less than 10percent of the estimated 20-70 million laboratory animals'' usedannually in the United States, Welsh said.   In a related matter, PETA on Thursday filed a $3 million lawsuitagainst writer Katie McCabe for an article on animal testing in theFebruary issue of ``Washingtonian'' magazine. The organizationalleged that the story showed ``malicious intent'' to damage itsreputation.   ``In 25 years of publication, we've never lost a suit foranything we've published,'' said Washingtonian editor Jack Limpert.``We're confident and we'll fight ... and win.''   IRRC is a non-profit corporation established in 1972 to doindependent research for institutional investors interested inproxy voting.</TEXT></DOC>
