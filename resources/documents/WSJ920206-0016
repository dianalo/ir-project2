The plan, one of the broadest reorganization efforts eversuggested for the intelligence system, reflects a widespreadbelief on Capitol Hill that the sprawling U.S. intelligencesystem needs to be trimmed and revamped in the wake of theend of the Cold War.</LP><TEXT>   Robert Gates, the new director of central intelligence, isscheduled to offer his own revamping plan to President Bushnext month. The parallel efforts to reshape the intelligencesystem virtually guarantee changes will be made soon.   The congressional plan was offered by Senate IntelligenceCommittee Chairman David Boren and House IntelligenceCommittee Chairman David McCurdy, both Oklahoma Democrats.Its centerpiece is a proposal to create a post, the Directorof National Intelligence, who would run the CentralIntelligence Agency, but also have broader powers tosupervise intelligence activities elsewhere in thegovernment. Perhaps most important, he also would haveincreased power over the intelligence budget. Much of thatsecret budget, estimated at about $30 billion, now liesburied within the Pentagon budget and is controlled by thesecretary of defense.</TEXT></DOC>
