American Home Products said it will pay $50 a share for40% of Genetics Institute's common shares outstanding, and itwill purchase about 9.5 million newly issued common sharesfor $300 million. The company also acquired an option to buythe rest of Genetics Institute at between $50 and $85 a shareuntil 1996.</LP><TEXT>   The acquisition gives American Home Products, a NewYork-based pharmaceutical and consumer health productscompany, access to one of the country's more respectedbiotechnology research companies. Analysts said theacquisition should help bolster American Home Products' drugdiscovery program, which has been lackluster for much of thepast decade.   Although Genetics Institute, based in Cambridge, Mass.,has several potentially important experimental medicines inits research pipeline, the drugs won't be available for salesoon. &quot;American Home is buying {Genetics Institute's} stronglong-term potential, drugs that could be marketed between1994 and 1997,&quot; said Stuart Weisbrod, an analyst with MerrillLynch andamp; Co.   As for Genetics Institute, its decision to sell a majoritystake caught Wall Street by surprise. &quot;No one had any thoughtthat this would happen,&quot; said Robert Kupor, a Kidder, Peabodyandamp; Co. analyst. &quot;The biotechnology sector is going to go uplike a shot&quot; given the sizable premium American Home agreedto pay for the Genetics Institute stake.   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,American Home was up 50 cents, to $68.625. In nationalover-the-counter trading, Genetics Institute was down 12.5cents, to $37.875. The announcement of the acquisition cameafter the markets closed.   Last March, Genetics Institute lost a drawn-out patentbattle over the anti-anemia drug erythropoietin, or EPO, toAmgen Inc., based in Thousand Oaks, Calif. While theappeals-court loss over EPO was a major blow to GeneticsInstitute, the company retained considerable financialresources and a number of promising experimental drugs invarious stages of development, including potential medicinesto promote bone growth, boost the immune system and arrestbleeding tendencies associated with chemotherapy for cancer.   As of July, the company had about $60 million in cash and&quot;no immediate need&quot; for additional capital, Garen Bohlin,executive vice president, said at that time. In its secondquarter, ended May 31, the company had a loss of $4.9million, or 42 cents a share, on revenue of $14.3 million.The company earlier said it expected to operate profitably inthe third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year.   &quot;Our No. 1 reason {for selling the stake to American Home}is resources,&quot; said Gabriel Schmergel, Genetics Institute'spresident and chief executive officer. &quot;The game we're intakes enormous resources. We concluded that we needed verysubstantial funds and chose this route to obtain them.&quot;   Mr. Schmergel said Genetics Institute's appeals-court lossto Amgen &quot;wasn't a contributing factor&quot; in its decision tosell stock to American Home Products. But the company'sshares have declined from as high as $62.50 in the past year,and American Home Products officials said the current pricemade the acquisition possible.   John Stafford, American Home Products' chairman and chiefexecutive officer, said the acquisition quickly provides hiscompany with the kind of biotechnology capability that otherbig drug makers have been developing or acquiring in recentyears. The purchase is similar to one made several years agowhen Roche Holding Ltd. of Switzerland acquired 60% ofGenentech Inc. of South San Francsico.   Mr. Schmergel said American Home initiated negotiationsbetween the companies earlier this year. He added that he andother Genetics Institute managers will remain at the companyin their current positions.   Under terms of the agreement, each Genetics Instituteshareholder will receive $20 in cash for each share of commonand a right to receive six-tenths of one share of new commonstock. Genetics Institute currently has 14.6 million sharesof common outstanding, 1.6 million preferred sharesconvertible into common, and warrants for 2.1 million commonshares. After the acquisition, American Home Products willown 16.7 million, or 60%, of 27.8 million common shares orcommon-share equivalents outstanding.   American Home Products also said it acquired an option tobuy the rest of the Genetics Institute's common shares at anytime until Dec. 31, 1996. The price for those shares willescalate from $50 to $85 each, rising about $1.85 a quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
