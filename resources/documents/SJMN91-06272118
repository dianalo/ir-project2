Not only is the contract worth several billion dollars, but thewinner will have a leg up on future work for that country and for its equallyaffluent neighbors.;   The U.S. concern is narrowly underbid by an overseasrival. Another case of American business failing the test of internationalcompetitiveness? Not this time. The winner undercuts the U.S. bid because ithas confidential information from the intelligence service of its owngovernment, a longtime American ally.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE: NEXT STEP FOR U.S. SPIES?SOME SAY DEFENSE AGAINST SNOOPS NEEDED  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     That, according to a former high-ranking U.S. intelligence official, is athinly disguised account of an episode that happened and remains shrouded insecrecy. &quot;If I gave you the specifics,&quot; the former official said, &quot;I could goto Leavenworth.&quot;;   And such episodes represent what some Americanintelligence specialists expect will become one of the most difficult problemsfacing the United States as the Cold War focus on military security subsides:the rising importance of economic intelligence.;   Carried on with all thesophisticated techniques spawned by half a century of East-West conflict --electronic eavesdropping, satellite photography, undercover moles and paidinformants, as well as computerized reviews of data gleaned from the publicrecord -- economic intelligence could become a major and highly controversialelement in global competitiveness.;   &quot;Aggressive acts of espionage pursued byforeign governments -- at times in collaboration with their intelligenceservices -- to steal private American commercial secrets to serve their ownnational interests are a clear indication of this threat,&quot; says Sen. DavidBoren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.;   Already,Boren has begun a series of closed discussions of the problem with Sen. SamNunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and othermembers of that panel. And both the CIA and the FBI have taken the first stepstoward formulating new strategies for protecting American companies againstforeign espionage.;   Beyond defensive measures, however, lies the moredifficult question of how far the United States should go in carrying outeconomic intelligence operations of its own. Most experts say having spiessteal specific secrets from foreign companies and hand them to Americancompanies is out of the question. But a host of more general possibilitiesremain.;   U.S. satellites, for example, now routinely gather data on cropproduction, weather and other factors affecting economic strength. Shouldmechanisms be developed to funnel such data to American business strategistsengaged in global trade? Should the nation's vast electronic intelligenceapparatus also monitor business communications, looking for evidence ofcollusion among foreign competitors and other unfair trade practices? Shouldthe government track the flow of money -- as it now does in the war on drugs-- or keep watch on overseas construction projects and other elements ofeconomic activity?;   Behind such questions is the growing conviction amongeconomists and some foreign policy experts that economic strength may becomemore critical to national security than more advanced missiles and otherartifacts of the superpower arms race.;   For the moment, the focus is ondefensive measures, in part because the United States has not adopted thepattern of direct partnership between business and government in internationalcompetition that prevails in Japan and much of Western Europe.;   AlthoughU.S. officials are reluctant to discuss specific instances in which supposedlyfriendly foreign intelligence agencies have spied upon U.S. businesses,examples are beginning to come to light.;   The most recent disclosure cameearlier this month when Pierre Marion, former head of France's intelligenceagency, told of creating a unit to gather information about secret technologyand marketing plans of private companies around the world. U.S. officialsconfirmed reports that the French had tried to recruit sources of informationinside overseas offices of Texas Instruments and International BusinessMachines Corp. to help Compagnie des Machines Bull. The partiallygovernment-owned French computer concern said it was not involved in anyindustrial spying.;   The French spying, U.S. officials contend, has extendedto Air France flights where, they maintain, hidden listening devices have beenplanted and other steps taken to pick up useful economic information. AirFrance denies that it has any knowledge of such activities.;   Leigh Weber, aformer U.S. intelligence official, says most economic intelligence gathered byforeign governments comes from electronic eavesdropping that picks uptelephone calls, fax transmissions and even open-air conversations. Because ofU.S. law and customs, American intelligence agencies do not pass on theinformation to domestic companies that might stand to gain or lose from it.Foreign intelligence agencies feel no such inhibitions.;   Meyer, in his book,&quot;Real World Intelligence,&quot; said that every branch office of every Japanesetrading company &quot;operates like an information vacuum cleaner, sucking ininformation . . . and even gossip.&quot;;   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a seniormember of the Senate intelligence committee, has called for a reorganizationof the CIA to shift personnel and equipment once devoted to military andpolitical intelligence operations against the Soviet Union &quot;to quickly pick up-- and I emphasize quickly -- the capabilities needed to defend this countryin economic security.&quot;;   And Robert Gates, President Bush's choice asdirector of central intelligence, said at his Senate confirmation hearingsthat the CIA and the FBI should mount &quot;a very aggressive program&quot; to preventforeign intelligence services from planting &quot;moles&quot; in American high-techcompanies and rifling &quot;briefcases of our businessmen who travel in theircountries.&quot;;   There is widespread resistance, however, to taking the nextstep and asking U.S. intelligence agencies to engage in activity that mighthelp American companies compete abroad.;   &quot;The CIA does not and will notengage in industrial espionage,&quot; says Mark Mansfield, a CIA spokesman.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RONALD J.
