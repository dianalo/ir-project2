The Congressional Budget Office has produced the latest Dickensian epic at the request of Maine's Democratic Senator George Mitchell. The senator appears to have got more than he bargained for. What the report really shows is that not only are the rich now paying more in taxes but that the Laffer Curve has also worked pretty much as advertised.    This is not, of course, how Senator Mitchell prefers to interpret the CBO's 78-page potboiler, &quot;The Changing Distribution of Federal Taxes: 1975-1990.&quot; Senator Mitchell called a news conference to announce that the poor are now paying more taxes than a decade ago, while the rich are paying less, and of course all this is President Reagan's fault. &quot;The study shows the extent to which the most privileged in our society have reaped tremendous benefits from Reagan administration tax policies,&quot; said Senator Mitchell, invoking the ancient theme of class warfare.    We wonder if the senator bothered to read the study, because if he had he might have recalled the famous line about damn lies and statistics. For starters, the study documents figures for only two years, 1977 and 1984 (and projections for 1988), so it's impossible to determine when the trends the study claims to highlight really got started. We suspect, for example, that for the poor the worst years for disposable income and high tax rates were actually 1980 and 1981, before the tax cuts took effect. Those were the years when soaring inflation pushed all income classes into higher tax brackets -- a trend that would have continued had the 1981 tax bill not passed.    The study does show that the poor pay slightly higher average tax rates now than in 1977, but this has nothing to do with the 1981 tax cuts or the 1986 tax reform. Both of those laws reduced the tax burden on the poor. (Tip O'Neill called the '86 tax act &quot;the best anti-poverty bill in this House for at least half a dozen years.&quot;) The higher average rates are the result of ever-climbing Social Security taxes; Senator Mitchell of course voted for the 1983 Social Security &quot;compromise&quot; that will continue to raise those taxes through 1990.    Perhaps the study's most interesting result is buried in the appendixes. There the reader learns that the rich actually are bearing more of the federal tax burden since the 1981 tax cuts. The richest 10% of American families paid 37.5% of all federal taxes in 1984, compared with 35.9% in 1977, and they'll pay 38.6% in 1988. The bottom 50% of all families, on the other hand, saw their share of all taxes fall -- to 12.9% in 1984 from 13.3% in 1977. The same pattern holds, even more starkly, if you look at income taxes alone (excluding Social Security taxes). Senator Mitchell, meet Arthur Laffer.    We can't help but point out that the study also shows that Americans as a whole will pay roughly the same share of their income in federal taxes in 1988 (22.7%) as they did in 1977 (22.8%). We can all therefore thank Senator Mitchell and his CBO study for demolishing the theory that it was the 1981 tax cuts that &quot;caused&quot; the budget deficit. </TEXT></DOC>
