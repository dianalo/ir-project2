(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state Court of Appeals has upheld a lawdenying a golf course property tax break to the prestigious BurningTree Club unless it accepts women as members.   The private club at Bethesda in Maryland's Washington suburbs hashistorically numbered congressmen, cabinet officials and U.S.Supreme Court justices among its members.   The tax break, which applies to both state and county taxes,allows clubs to pay a special rate by agreeing to maintain a golfcourse as open space and not use it for commercial or residentialdevelopment.   The 1986 law on accepting women was declared unconstitutionalJuly 22, 1987, by Anne Arundel Circuit Judge Martin A. Wolff,because of a provision allowing clubs to exclude ``certain sexes onspecific days or at specific times.'' He said the entire law wasinvalid because that one section violated the state's equal rightsamendment.   The state's highest court on Wednesday agreed that the exemptionallowing discrimination on certain days or certain times wasunconstitutional, but said that didn't invalidate the entire law.   As a result, clubs accepting the preferential tax treatment willhave to admit women and can't set aside times or days exclusivelyfor men or women.   Burning Tree is the only Maryland club maintaining a men-onlymembership policy that takes advantage of the property tax break.   Court records showed that for the 1986-87 tax year, Burning Treesaved about $300,000 in state and local taxes under the open spacetax exemption.   Robert Zarnoch, an assistant state attorney general, said otherclubs in Maryland claim the preferred tax rate while setting asidetee times for men or women.   James Dunbar, a lawyer who represented Burning Tree before theappeals court, said he had not had time to read and digest the 5-2majority opinion and dissent and couldn't comment on whether therewill be a further appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
