Joe is 'Offended'</HL><DD> 05/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   Now that Ken Cribb is working at the White House, Edwin Meese needs a new counselor to the attorney general. He picked William Bradford Reynolds, who also will remain assistant AG for civil rights. This outraged the liberals who fought off Mr. Reynolds's nomination to become associate AG two years ago. Sen. Joe Biden (D., Del.) says he is &quot;offended by Mr. Meese's action&quot; and wants to stop the move. This marks an interesting new view of separation of powers: Executive-branch officers must go through Sen. Biden to hire their personal staffs. </TEXT></DOC>
