(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A growing number of investors are usingopals like money on Florida's Gulf Coast, bartering thesemiprecious stones for Mercedes-Benz automobiles and real estatesometimes worth millions of dollars.   The opals have been used to satisfy all or part of the sellingprice in these deals, and the sellers then use the opals in othertransactions, The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported Monday.   Some experts cautioned that it can be difficult, if notimpossible, to cash in on the appraised value of the semipreciousstones, especially in large quantities.   The exchange system has not yet resulted in large liquidationsof opals for cash, jewelers said.   The opals ``take on the character of currency,'' said JohnDaunt, a master gemologist and owner of Gemstone Corp. of Americain Sarasota.   Gerry Manning, president of Manning Opal Co. in New York, saidbuyers may be surprised when they try to resell their stones.   Top grade opals have a worldwide market, but stones sold inlarge quantities seldom achieve their retail value, Manning said.   ``Very often, in my experience, the values are incrediblyoverstated ... there is no secondary market for these stones,'' hesaid.   ``There is no place to convert them to cash,'' agreed ArthurHeilsberg, a real estate agent who has been involved intransactions involving opals.   But he added, ``If the stones can be turned over in anotherdeal, who cares what they're all worth in cash?''   When Frank Byars sold his troubled Tiki Gardens touristattraction in the Pinellas County city of Indian Shores, heaccepted $1 million in opals as part of the reported $3 millionpackage.   Byars is reluctant to discuss the sale. Asked if he thought hegot a fair deal, he said, ``No, I can't sell them (the opals).''   One local gemologist cited another deal, with an unnamedpurveyor of opals, in which a lawyer agreed to sell a Mercedes-Benzfor the semiprecious stones.   Two Australians, Neville Schmidt and Darrell Roder, havecontracted to buy several millions of dollars worth of property inManatee and Sarasota counties using cash and opals as payment,according to their trustee, Sarasota attorney Peter Jaensch.   In one deal, Sarasota real estate investor Robert H. Jones soldthem a shopping center and an office building in Bradenton formillions in cash and opals.   Schmidt and Roder purchased the office building for $660,000 _half in cash, half in opals, according to Heilsberg, an agent withVPN General Realty who handled the transaction.   He said the Australians are trading black opals, which theyobtain from a mine they own in Australia.   Janet Post, owner of Janet F. Post Jewelry andamp; Antiques inSarasota, said she has appraised the Australians' opals ``dozensand dozens of times.''   Post has provided what she called ``retail replacement''appraisals to her clients, who pay her $50 an hour. That appraisaljudges what a stone would be worth if it were bought at a retailjewelry store, set in jewelry. These types of appraisals are mostcommonly used to value a stone for insurance purposes.   ``An average per carat (price) for a fine stone has been from$250 to $1,500 per carat,'' Post said.   She said she has never provided or been asked to provide ``afair market value'' for the opals, or what they would be worth ifturned into cash.</TEXT></DOC>
