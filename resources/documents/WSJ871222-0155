Lifting Egypt back to its former position of Arab leadership is a tougher proposition.    In the eight years of Egypt's isolation following the signing of a peace treaty with Israel, much has gone wrong. The plunge in oil prices cut Egypt's modest oil-export earnings and slashed the amount sent home by Egyptians who work abroad in oil-rich states. Expatriate remittances have almost halved from their 1984 peak of $3.9 billion.    And since 1979, the country's population has soared more than 23%, to 50.5 million, with a million new mouths arriving every nine months. In just the past four years, the country's external debt has ballooned 26%, to $44.1 billion.    Egyptians joke about their plight: &quot;The Arab world isn't what it was when Egypt led it,&quot; goes a popular Cairo saying, &quot;and Egypt isn't what it was, either.&quot;    Despite its military heft -- Egypt's regular armed forces number close to half a million, compared with a puny 12,000 in vulnerable Kuwait and just 67,500 in Saudi Arabia -- the country simply isn't in a position to lead the Arabs in their confrontation with Iran. The confrontation has grown out of that non-Arab state's seven-year war with Iraq.    &quot;The enthusiasm for any foreign military adventure is precisely nil,&quot; says a Western diplomat. &quot;Everybody remembers Yemen -- no one pleasantly.&quot;    In the 1960s, President Gamal Abdel Nasser committed about one-third of Egypt's army to a costly campaign in support of a republican insurgency against North Yemen's Saudi-backed ruling imam. Distance made Egypt's contribution a logistical shambles, and sending a division or two all the way to the Persian Gulf to protect the Arab states threatened by Iran would pose even greater practical problems. Nevertheless, at a news conference early in November, Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel Halim Abu Ghazala bluntly stated that Egypt wasn't prepared to accept Iraq's defeat, and such remarks may provide a psychological boost to the war-weary Iraqis.    For Iranians, an Egypt reintegrated with its Arab brethren &quot;is another link in an encircling chain -- and it's a very big link,&quot; says Don Kerr, a Middle East specialist at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. What Egypt hopes to do, says Boutros Ghali, the minister of state for foreign affairs, is tilt the balance in the Arab world toward the moderate states and add weight to diplomatic initiatives to end the Iran-Iraq war.    &quot;We are more interested in the peace process than in confrontation,&quot; he says, &quot;and that goes for Israel as well as Iraq and Iran.&quot;    The reconciliation with Arab countries also offers Egypt a second chance to press for a comprehensive peace with Israel, says Mr. Ghali, who took part in the Camp David meetings. Those negotiations started out seeking a peace settlement that would include the other Arab states, but dwindled in the end to a bilateral agreement.    President Hosni Mubarak is expected to visit Washington next month, and Egypt's renewed role in Arab affairs is likely to be high on the agenda for talks with President Reagan. The country's troubled economy probably will receive attention as well.    Cairo is the only Arab capital in which the Star of David, flying from the roof of the Israeli Embassy, shares the skyline with an array of Arab flags, including the banner of the Palestine Liberation Organization.    Indeed, Egypt has used its special position during the past week to issue a flurry of protests excoriating Israel for its violent response to demonstrations in the occupied Gaza Strip, saying the troubles highlight the necessity for peace negotiations. The demonstrations, breaking out so soon after the resumption of diplomatic ties with Egypt, may well be an expression of Palestinians' frustration with the way their issue seemed almost to slip off the agenda at the Arab summit. At the gathering, Arab leaders appeared far more preoccupied with Iran than Israel, and the Palestinian spokesman, Yasser Arafat, was almost ignored.    (Sudan, Somalia and Oman never severed ties with Egypt following its suspension from the Arab League; Jordan and Djibouti restored relations prior to the November summit, while the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait, Morocco, North Yemen, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Mauritania and Qatar have done so since. While the summit stopped short of reviving Egypt's Arab League membership, Syria, Lybia, Tunisia, Algeria, Lebanon and South Yemen now are the only league countries that don't have full relations.)    &quot;As long as Egypt is the only Arab country with diplomatic relations with Israel, we can use our good offices to help gain acceptance for a formula for an international conference,&quot; says Mostafa Khalil, chairman of the Arab International Bank and a former Camp David negotiator.    Just after the Arab summit, Mr. Khalil visited Israel and talked with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres about the prospects for peace. He feels it will be difficult to move Mr. Shamir toward the conference table unless the U.S. applies pressure.    President Mubarak, who will have to manage any new opportunities emerging from the resumption of ties, has a low-key, unpretentious style very different from his high-profile predecessors. &quot;He doesn't have any illusions of becoming a second Nasser, or even a second Sadat,&quot; says Ismail-Sabri Abdalla, chairman of the Third World Forum research group in Cairo. &quot;Many Third World countries suffer from the megalomania of their heads of state. Egypt benefits by Mubarak's modesty.&quot;    Adds a Western diplomat: &quot;He's a big-brother figure, rather than a dominant-father figure. Maybe that's why he has so much support from the other Arabs; they know he won't try to dominate, but will work with them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
