Some crop-destroying caterpillarsare about to find out.   A small Salt Lake City biotechnology company, funded byFMC Corp., reported its genetic engineers had plucked apoisonproducing gene from a spider and inserted it into avirus that infects pesty caterpillars. When the caterpillarswallows the virus it infects the creature's own cells withthe spider gene. The infected cells essentially poisonthemselves, thereby killing the caterpillar.</LP><TEXT>   Both the virus and the spider gene are harmless to plantsand animals other than caterpillars, the company said.   The feat was announced by Natural Products Sciences Inc.Chicago-based FMC has exclusive marketing rights to anycommercial product that exploits the research.   FMC is planning to approach the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency to see what data the agency will require toapprove a field test of the new pesticide, said William VanSaun, director of discovery research at the company'slaboratories in Princeton, N.J. FMC is a major producer ofchemical pesticides but &quot;we look at this as an opportunity toget into agricultural pest control using biopesticides,&quot; Dr.Van Saun said.   The NPS researchers are the latest to report successfulfirst steps toward a new kind of biological insecticide thatscientists hope eventually will be harmless replacements forthe more hazardous chemical insecticides currently used.Within the past seven months, three other research teamsreported they are pursuing the same idea of inserting apoison gene into caterpillar-infecting viruses.   All the researchers are using a virus that infects onlythe larvae, or caterpillars, of a variety of moths. Theseviruses kill the worms they infect but do so rather slowly,taking as long as a week from infection to death, duringwhich time the insects can do a lot of damage to a crop.   By adding a poison-making gene to the viruses, theresearchers hope to make insecticides that work faster thanthe natural viruses. Their research differs mainly in thetype of toxin-making gene that is transplanted to the virus.   An entomologist and a geneticist at the University ofGeorgia in Athens reported last July that they had taken apoison-producing gene from a mite that kills insects andinserted the gene into the caterpillarinfecting virus. Themite toxin causes muscle contraction and paralysis in a broadrange of insects but tests showed it was harmless to mice.   Two other research teams reported they had taken atoxin-making gene from a scorpion and put it into thecaterpillar-infecting virus, cutting the time to kill halfthe bugs to 88 hours from 125 hours for the natural virus.One research team to use the scorpion toxin gene is at theNERC Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology inOxford, England. The other team is at the University ofCalifornia, Davis, which is working with researchers at aunit of Ciba-Geigy Ltd. of Switzerland.</TEXT></DOC>
