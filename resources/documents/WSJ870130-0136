A pay stub is a study in simplicity: gross pay, taxes, net pay, etc. The complex part comes in trying to evaluate the largest, but sometimes inadequate, amount on the stub. How big should the gross be? What am I worth? How does my pay compare with others who do similar work? Could it be bigger in a different occupation or different city, or with a different employer?    Such questions must occasionally come to the minds of the 120 million Americans who are either employed or looking for work. Unfortunately, hard answers are tough to find: They're buried in obscure government documents or in corporate or industry association files. Thus, the potential importance of &quot;The American Almanac of Jobs and Salaries&quot; (Avon, 722 pages, $12.95) by John W. Wright.    An almanac, according to my dictionary, is &quot;a compendium of useful and interesting facts.&quot; There are many of both kinds here. A bright high-school senior, for example, might find it useful to know that of 12 occupations that pay a median weekly salary of more than $600 a week, five of them, accounting for nearly half the jobs, are engineers of one kind or another. But that's chicken feed if you can throw a baseball. According to this book, the average major-league baseball player makes more than $5,800 a week, and 50 of them collect checks of $20,000 a week or more.    Unfortunately, this book seems to have been written for everyone from that high-school senior to a Ph.D. labor-market analyst. The result is an intensely fragmented volume. While the article by Edward J. Dwyer Jr. giving advice to those looking for their first job is excellent, it seems oddly out of place coming between a somewhat academic discussion of women's wages and a large chapter on historical wages and salaries. In trying to serve so many interests, this book fails to serve any very well.    The section on book publishing, for example, describes what, say, acquisition editors and production directors do, and how much they make. But instead of suggesting how to get one of the well-paying jobs, the author merely reprints an article chastising the industry for paying editorial assistants too little while granting authors advances that are too large. No one familiar with publishing will think that is news; such polemicizing is more disruptive than informative.    The rough landscape of this work is littered with the author's opinions, which have no place in an almanac (though they might have been treated effectively in a separate book). A five-or-10-paragraph discussion on pay differentials among occupations -- which the author assumes are inequitable -- hardly does justice to a very complex subject.    The structural reasons for such pay differentials are not explored. The author asks such questions as &quot;Why do architects almost always earn significantly less than accountants?&quot; without probing the obvious explanation that a great many buildings get built without an architect but virtually no firms get through the year without paying an accountant.    There is also the familiar editorializing about overpaid federal workers, many of whom earn $60,000 to $80,000 annually. That may sound like a lot to a social worker in Syracuse who makes $25,000 a year. But nobody expects that social worker to face the Washington housing market -- where reasonable homes go for $250,000 -- or to live the life style expected of those federal-agency directors.    In all the discussion of pay &quot;inequities,&quot; the author overlooks issues of job security, unpleasant work, regional or local cost-of-living differences as well as the relative scarcity or abundance of workers in specific occupations. This almanac would have been far more useful if it contained more explanation of the figures (i.e. giving ranges of salaries instead of medians) and more descriptions of what kind of traveling, pressure and real work hours are involved with the higher-paying jobs.    The author is at his best when he cautions against accepting occupational labor force projections as absolute truths. Sections that describe what people in certain occupations actually do are also excellent. Sentences that begin: &quot;In most basic terms what accountants do is . . .&quot; or &quot;There has been a marked increase in competitiveness among dentists . . .&quot; may be more useful than the median salary data to would-be accountants or dentists.    Mr. Wright tries to gather what is known about pay and opportunity in various service-sector occupations. In addition, he aims to advance his own opinions about the lack of fairness in the labor market. He is partly successful; he provides useful and interesting facts for anyone seeking a better job or just trying to satisfy curiosity. But the opinions are like hairs in a tasty bowl of soup, extraneous and damned annoying.    ---   Mr. Francese is president of American Demographics Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
