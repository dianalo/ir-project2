Albert Gore Jr. dismissed his poor showingin New Hampshire and sought support Wednesday in Southern states,saying too much emphasis had been put on early presidentialcontests.   He also criticized fellow Democratic candidates, accusing themof being out of touch and saying, ``I see all of the othercandidates as peas in the same pod.''   ``This is the kickoff of the main event in this election year,''Gore said at a conference for supporters telecast from Houston.``This is the time we kick our campaign into high gear.''   He made his comment about ``peas in the same pod'' earlier, inan interview on ``CBS This Morning.'' In that same interview, hesaid his rivals picked up some harmful ``political baggage in theform of positions they adopted'' in Iowa and New Hampshire.   In Houston, Gore said he had no regrets about skipping the NewHampshire primary and Iowa caucuses and turning his money andattention to the South, where more than a dozen states havecontests on March 8, known as Super Tuesday.   The Tennessee senator, who finished fifth in the New Hampshireprimary Tuesday with about 7 percent of the vote, had campaignedlittle there and in Iowa, where he also did poorly.   ``The importance of Super Tuesday is not simply in the fact thatalmost half the delegates will be selected on March 8,'' Gore said.``The importance of Super Tuesday is also in the fact that thereare people all over the United States who have been waiting to seemore power given to Democrats at the grass-roots level in theselection of a Democratic nominee.''   The conference was telecast to an estimated 52 locations in morethan 30 cities. About 40 supporters attended at the site of thetelecast in Houston.   Gore said three Democratic rivals _ he later identified them asJesse Jackson, Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis _ ``have takenpositions on foreign policy and defense policy that are completelyout of touch with the mainstream voters in this country.''   Gephardt, who finished second in New Hampshire and won the Iowacaucuses, has flip-flopped on issues in his campaign, Gore said.   ``It is now very widely known that Dick Gephardt's positionsadopted for the Iowa caucuses are just completely at odds with whathe's done in the last 12 years in the House and Senate,'' he said.``There's a very long list; it's not just one or two positions.''   Gore had other scheduled stops in Beaumont, Texas; Shreveport,La., and Dallas on Wednesday as he continued his campaign in theSouth and other Super Tuesday states.   ``We're going to win it because we've conserved our resources toaim right at the Super Tuesday states,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
