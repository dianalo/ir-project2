Carey Butsavage, an attorney for the UFCW, said the union willseek to make Dart Group, based in Landover, Md., reimburse employeesfor any lost wages they would have earned under their current unioncontracts.   The UCFW also wants Dart to pay the costs of employees' medicalinsurance and retraining.   Bradlees is a discount store chain owned by Boston-based Stop andamp;Shop Cos. Inc., the target of an unsuccessful buyout attempt by theHafts earlier this year. Stop andamp; Shop decided to sell many of itsBradlees stores to help pay the debt it incurred in a $1.23 billionleveraged buyout undertaken to thwart Dart.   ``A leveraged buyout blocked the Haft takeover but they walkedaway with their customary fat profit _ this time, $17 million,''said Tom McNutt, president of Local 400 of the UCFW. ``Bradleesemployees had their jobs sold out from under them to pay the costsof the Haft raid.''   Dart Group, controlled by Herbert Haft and his son Robert, hasbeen involved in a number of unsuccessful takeovers.   Robert Haft, Dart Group president, on Monday defended hiscompanies' actions in a press release saying, ``The claims arewithout merit and appear to be a publicity stunt.''   The civil suit was to be filed in Camden, N.J., the union said.Court papers were made available to reporters Monday, but courtofficials in New Jersey could not immediately say whether the suitactually had been filed.   Although Dart controls retail operations of its own, such asCrown Books, the Hafts have earned a reputation as corporate raidersby launching bids for several major retailing chains such asSupermarkets General, Safeway Stores and Eckerd Corp.   None of the raids have been successful, but in most of them Dartreportedly has profited by selling its stock to the target companyor a rival bidder.   Dart launched its bid for Stop andamp; Shop in January. Following asimilar pattern, Stop andamp; Shop's stock price soared as managementfought to remain independent and speculators anticipated a biddingwar.   Stop andamp; Shop finally agreed to a leveraged buyout arranged by NewYork-based Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. In such deals, a company isacquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with thecompany's cash flow or money raised by the sale of its assets.   The deal allowed Stop andamp; Shop to remain independent, but to paythe enormous debt it had to sell part of its underperformingBradlees division. Hechinger Co. bought the leases to 47 localBradlees stores.   In May, Stop andamp; Shop said it would sell all of the 58 Bradleesstores in its Southern divison, including southern New Jersey,Maryland and Virginia, approximately one-third of the Bradlees itowns. The company decided not to sell its 113 Stop andamp; Shop stores.</TEXT></DOC>
