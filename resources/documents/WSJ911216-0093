Just what is the right course for someone who wants decentreturns but isn't comfortable taking much risk?</LP><TEXT>   The answer depends a lot on how soon the person will needthe money. &quot;The key is: What is your holding period? What isyour investment horizon?&quot; says William Reichenstein, afinance professor at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.   At one extreme are people investing dollars they will tapwithin the next few years, perhaps to pay college bills.While they may not like current short-term interest rates,&quot;they simply have to grin and bear it,&quot; says S. TimothyKochis, a San Francisco financial planner. &quot;They have nobusiness&quot; putting that money in stocks, he says, becausestock-market returns are unpredictable over short periods.   At the other end of the spectrum are people investing atleast some dollars for the long haul, perhaps for retirement20 or 30 years from now. When interest rates were higher,they may have been happy keeping those long-term savings inmoney funds or other low-risk, interest-bearing investments.But today's puny rates provide a good reason to considerputting more dollars in stocks.   &quot;The real risk to them long term is failure to meet theirfinancial goals,&quot; says John Markese, director of research forthe American Association of Individual Investors, aChicago-based group. He says investors &quot;can almost assure&quot;that failure by sticking to money funds and the like.   If investors really want to build their nest eggs -- whichrequires earning investment returns comfortably ahead ofinflation -- &quot;they should be heavily in the stock market,&quot;Mr. Markese says.   The case for investing a large share of one's long-termsavings in stocks lies in the track record of the pastseveral decades: From the beginning of 1926 through Sept. 30,common stocks delivered a compound annual return of 10.3%,according to Ibbotson Associates Inc., a Chicago researchfirm that is the recognized source for such figures.   In contrast, compound annual returns were 4.7% forlong-term U.S. Treasury bonds and 3.7% for short-termTreasury bills. Inflation ran at a compound annual rate of3.1%.   The investment figures are total returns reflecting pricechange as well as dividend or interest income. Ibbotson'sstock figures are for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.The returns that investors earn on money funds and bankaccounts are typically close to those on Treasury bills.   Over time, the performance of stocks has certainly beenmuch more erratic than the returns people earn oninterest-bearing securities. Over the past few decades, theSandamp;P 500-stock average saddled investors with a one-year lossas steep as 26% (in 1974) and delivered a one-year return asgreat as 37% (in the very next year, 1975). The fluctuationswere even more extreme in the years during and just after theDepression.   But financial advisers say long-term investors need tolook beyond those variations and put much of their money inthe assets that are likely to be worth the most at the endof, say, 25 years. &quot;Over that length of time, stocks in alllikelihood are going to outperform debt -- and probablyoutperform it by a substantial margin,&quot; says Prof.Reichenstein.   What types of investors have too little of their money instocks?   One group singled out by Malcolm A. Makin, a Westerly,R.I., financial planner, is retirees. Many people sell theirstocks when they retire because &quot;they think they cannottolerate any risk any longer,&quot; says Mr. Makin, president ofProfessional Planning Group. &quot;They are not aware that by notbeing in equities to some extent, they are, in fact, riskingprincipal {to inflation}.&quot;   Mr. Makin generally recommends that retirees keep 30% oftheir investment dollars in a mix of three or four stockmutual funds. He says his recommended stock allocation mightbe as high as 80% for single professionals in their late 20sor early 30s.   Estimates by First Boston Corp. and the Federal Reservehave suggested that individuals on average have less than 20%of their financial assets in stocks and stock funds. Otherstudies have found that employees who can allocateprofit-sharing or other retirement-plan dollars usually putthe bulk of their funds in interest-paying rather thanstock-market accounts.   While recommending that many people beef up their equityholdings, though, financial advisers offer some caveats.   In particular, they admonish people not to move a largeportion of their investment dollars in one fell swoop. Thebetter course: Shift into stocks in several installments overthe next year or two.   &quot;It prevents you from putting in a lot of money onTuesday, and the market loses 200 points on Wednesday, andyou are in the hospital with a heart attack on Thursday,&quot; Mr.Makin says.   Long-term investors need to steel themselves againstpanicking when the market has a lousy day or week or month.And they should realize that holding stocks for, say, aperiod as long as five years doesn't guarantee investmentsuccess.   Over the 30 years from 1961 through last year, forexample, stocks solidly outperformed Treasury bills. Butthere were quite a few five-year and even 10-year intervalswithin that period when investors did better in Treasurybills, according to the Ibbotson data.   The 10-year period from 1969 through 1978, for instance,encompassed several years of high inflation and poor stockresults. For the period, Ibbotson's data show, stocksproduced a compound annual return of 3.2% vs. 5.9% forTreasury bills; neither kept up with the inflation rate,which was 6.7%.   But stock investors who hung in for another 10 years wonbig in the stock-market boom of the '80s and saw the poorperformance of the '70s eclipsed. For the 20-year period from1969 through 1988, stocks delivered a compound annual returnof 9.5%, comfortably ahead of Treasury bills at 7.5% andinflation of 6.3%.   In fact, stocks outperformed Treasury bills for all20-year periods since 1926 -- at least when looking at themore than 500 rolling 20-year periods ending at eachmonth-end, according to Laurence B. Siegel, managing directorat Ibbotson Associates.   But here's a bit of investment trivia: Mr. Siegel saysthere is a slightly longer period of 20 years and severalmonths, from late 1961 into 1982 -- and encompassing bearmarkets in 1962, 1974 and 1982 -- when Treasury bills toppedstocks.</TEXT></DOC>
