However,for the case of multilayer fenestration systems, this approach does notprovide information about the net absorptance of each layer. Moreover,the same layers can be ordered in more than one way, resulting in fenestrationsystems with different solar-optical properties, the determination whichrequires additional experimental procedures. This paper describes a mathematicalmodel for the calculation of the bidirectional solar-optical propertiesof multi-layer fenestration systems, using the bidirectional solar-opticalproperties of each layer. The model is based on the representation ofthe bidirectional solar-optical properties using matrices. Matrix operationsare then used to calculate the bidirectional solar-optical propertiesof any combination of layers, considering the interreflections betweenthem. This approach offers two advantages: (1) the reduction of the experimentalprocedures to those required for the determination of the bidirectionaltransmittance and reflectance of fenestration layers, rather than completefenestration systems, and (2) the determination of the net absorptanceof each layer as part of the fenestration system, rather than the totalabsorptance of the complete fenestration system. 7 refs., 4 figs., 1tab.</TEXT></DOC>
