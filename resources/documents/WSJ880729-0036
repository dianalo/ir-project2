Coastal Corp. said its second-quarter net income rose 37%, while Transco Energy Co. reported a 29% drop in net after a charge. Meanwhile, Panhandle Eastern Corp. posted a small loss after a rate refund.    Coastal reported net of $30.6 million, or 50 cents a share, up from $22.3 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 11% to $1.86 billion from $1.68 billion. Coastal's average number of common shares outstanding increased 21% from a year earlier.    Securities analysts said Coastal's second-quarter results were &quot;crackerjack&quot; but came mostly from significantly lower interest expense. Indeed, four of Coastal's five segments -- natural gas, refining and marketing, coal, and trucking -- reported operating profit that was about flat or down from a year ago.    Only Coastal's exploration and production unit reported significantly higher operating profit -- more than double a year ago -- and that was because of settlement of a contested gas supply contract. Operating profit from refining and marketing, off 20%, was a surprise to many industry watchers, given that refinery margins have been extremely strong recently. But Coastal said those margins were &quot;partially offset by an inventory writedown.&quot;    Transco reported net of $3 million, or 10 cents a share, down from $4.2 million, or 15 cents a share. Revenue for the second quarter was $702 million, up 9% from $642 million a year earlier.    The results included a $15.8 million charge for settlement of a 1979 curtailment lawsuit and represented &quot;standout performance&quot; from Transco's pipelines, which benefited from the heat waves in the Northeast, said John Olson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s office here. &quot;Power plants in New York and New Jersey run on natural gas,&quot; he explained. &quot;With the air conditioning load so high, power plants and local distribution companies have been stretched to the limit.&quot; He also added that Transco started recovering some of its contract settlement costs from customers May 1.    Panhandle Eastern reported a second-quarter loss of $1.2 million, reflecting regulatory decisions that prohibit certain charges to customers, and a $4 million rate refund from a related pending case. For the 1987 second quarter, Panhandle reported net from continuing operations of $21.6 million, or 41 cents a share. Revenue dropped 12% to $284.6 million from $325.1 million.    The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision to disallow the commodity minimum bill hit Panhandle fully for the first time in the second quarter. The company had been &quot;heavily dependent on the minimum bill, a kind of shock absorber that allows pipelines to collect costs even when volume&quot; falls below a certain level, said Mr. Olson. Those costs are expected to be shifted into Panhandle's transportation and sales rates, but the company is &quot;operating in limbo right now,&quot; he said.    The company's pipeline volumes have been &quot;phenomenal,&quot; Mr. Olson said. Panhandle said volume for the first half was up 34% over volume for the first half of l987, reflecting advances in Indiana and Ohio and increased deliveries to Canada, as well as &quot;aggressive selling strategies&quot; in all markets. </TEXT></DOC>
