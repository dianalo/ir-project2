Viner Unit Sues Haas and Others,Charging Stock Manipulation in Crash---By Pamela SebastianStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EAVKF RBANKRUPTCIES (BCY)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Edward A. Viner andamp; Co. sued Haas Securities Corp. and others for $5 million, charging financially plagued Haas with manipulating certain stocks in an attempt to protect its business amid the October market crash.    The suit, filed in federal court in New York, alleges a scheme involving a woman claiming to be a former Haas broker who opened several accounts at Pace Securities Inc., where the trades were placed. Haas, a major over-the-counter market maker, halted business in late October and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings in November.    Viner, a unit of E.A. Viner Holdings Ltd., Toronto, acts as clearing agent for Pace, a small discount broker. Pace was forced to temporarily freeze business after several allegedly bogus trades drained its capital. After a two-week hiatus, Pace resumed business on Nov. 12, with the assistance of Viner.    According to the suit, Toni Vallen, who claimed to be a former broker, portfolio manager and investment adviser at Haas, sought a job at Pace Securities in October, saying she was &quot;a significant producer of business at Haas.&quot;    Beginning the tumultous week of Oct. 19, according to the suit, Ms. Vallen fraudulently placed numerous buy orders valued at about $4 million, focusing on six stocks in which Haas was influential as a market maker or underwriter.    The suit charges the pre-arranged trades were directed to Haas and Capital Shares Corp., North Providence, R.I., another market maker in the disputed stocks, which is also charged in the suit. Capital Shares officials couldn't be reached for comment.    The suit charged that the trades helped temporarily maintain artificially high prices in six stocks: TS Industries Inc., Big O Tires Inc., Fountain Powerboat Industries Inc., Cliff Engle Ltd., Digital Metcom Inc., and Tunex International Inc.    The stocks subsequently lost 70% to 90% of their value by the end of October. When many of the buyers didn't materialize, Pace and Viner allege they were left holding the sorely devalued stocks.    Ms. Vallen left the Pace offices after Oct. 27 -- before she was officially hired -- according to an attorney for Viner. The attorney said Ms. Vallen invoked Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent in a recent deposition taken out of court. She didn't return phone calls to her Manhattan apartment.    Haas officials weren't available for comment. Haas attorneys noted that the action against Haas is currently stayed in light of its Chapter 11 proceedings.    The suit, which was filed Oct. 30, also names as defendants Haas's clearing agent, L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., a unit of L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., and 20 unknown persons or companies alleged to have participated in the purported scheme. Rothchild representatives weren't available for comment. The case is scheduled for a hearing Feb. 15. </TEXT></DOC>
