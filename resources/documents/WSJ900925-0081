The run-up of more than $3 a barrel for some crudes addedto the prospect of inflation, depressed the U.S. stock marketand increased support for tapping into the U.S. StrategicPetroleum Reserve.</LP><TEXT>   Only a month after breaking the $30 a barrel mark, severalcrudes surged beyond $39 a barrel in trading with the U.S.futures price reaching $39.20 briefly. Some North Sea oil wasvalued at $40 a barrel on European spot markets in latetrading, although details of transactions at those levelsweren't confirmed.   Even though it dropped back from the high, crude traded onthe New York Mercantile Exchange posted a futures record.Crude oil for November delivery was up $2.82 a barrel tosettle at $38.25. That was the highest price for this type ofoil, a light low-sulfur crude, since West Texas Intermediate,the U.S. benchmark, reached $39.80 a barrel in the cashmarket in March 1980.   Fuels reflected the escalation in crude oil prices. InU.S. futures trading, heating oil and unleaded gasoline forOctober delivery rose nearly seven cents a gallon each tosettle at $1.04 a gallon each.   The oil-price surge followed a weekend statement fromBaghdad by Saddam Hussein that he would strike at Middle Eastoil fields before he would let U.S.-led sanctions &quot;strangle&quot;Iraq. Although the Iraqi president has issued warningsagainst a U.S. attack on Iraq, his new remarks wereinterpreted as indicating he might strike first.   Iraq failed in its eight-year war with Iran to halt thatnation's oil flow. Oil and military analysts questionedwhether Iraq could be any more successful in destroying SaudiArabia's well-defended installations if it tried.   Still, Saddam Hussein's statement advanced war fearsanother notch and kept alive the possibility of majordisruptions of the flow of oil from the Middle East, whichholds the bulk of the world's reserves. As a result, the newthreats were quickly reflected in higher petroleum pricesaround the world as trading opened yesterday.   &quot;The market is very, very jittery,&quot; said Peter Beutel,director of the energy group at Pegasus Econometric. &quot;Peopleare afraid we are going to see a war in the Middle East.&quot;   Few oil analysts were bold enough to forecast thedirection of the oil market after the rapid escalation ofrecent days. Several suggested that $40 is no longer out ofreach and that $65 may well be the likely target, as somestudies have predicted, if war breaks out.   Most private and government energy officials continued tomaintain that the industry's supply-demand fundamentals don'tjustify the current levels of pricing. Barring an extremelycold winter or a disruption, oil supplies should be ample,they said.   &quot;The market is anticipating an awful lot,&quot; said PeterGignoux, manager of the international energy desk in Londonfor Shearson Lehman Brothers. &quot;Without hostilities, we aretotally, fully priced.&quot;   Most oil economists agreed that oil market participantsare clearly reacting to the words of Saddam Hussein. &quot;Themarket now is suggesting we are on a war footing,&quot; saidLawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation, &quot;and a war premium has been built intothe {pricing} system.&quot;   The Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a non-profitorganization that receives some financing from oil companies,is a leading supporter of opening up the U.S. StrategicPetroleum Reserve to help damp the escalation in oil prices.Its position is that the artificially high prices damageeconomies.   &quot;We believe it's time to release SPR barrels&quot; to preventfurther deterioration of the U.S. economy, said Mr.Goldstein.   Under the law that established the reserve, President Bushmust make a &quot;finding&quot; that there is justification forcommercial releases of oil from the reserve because of an oilshortage. But proponents of opening the reserve contend thatthe evidence of supply restraints won't show up until longafter the shortage has begun.   A test of the system is planned for next month, however.Recent legislation approved by Congress to establish a newtarget of one billion barrels of oil for the reserve, whichcontains slightly under 600 million barrels, would permitwithdrawals, totaling as much as five million barrels, insuch a test.   &quot;It could have the same psychological effect on the marketthat a commercial release would have,&quot; Mr. Goldstein said.</TEXT></DOC>
