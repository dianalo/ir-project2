The mission, sponsored by the Latin American Trade AdvisoryGroup and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is ``thefirst contact toward re-establishment of trade relations with atraditional partner of Britain,'' said Lord Montgomery, leader ofthe group.   He and the delegation met with Oscar Saggese, secretary ofindustry and foreign trade and attended a luncheon with theArgentine Chamber of Commerce.   Britain's embassy has been closed since the 74-day war in 1982for the South Atlantic archipelago, which Argentina started andBritain won.   Formal talks aimed at restoring relations without resolving theissue of sovereignty over the islands, which both nations claim,began earlier this year in New York and Madrid. Further meetingsare scheduled next month in Montevideo, Uruguay, and next year inParis.   The trade delegation is to meet President Carlos Menem onThursday and will consult with ``representatives of business, banksand state organisms scheduled for privatization,'' Montgomery said.   He said the mission would ``evaluate current politicalconditions to see if they are favorable for future capitalinvestments in areas such as petrochemicals, petroleum andagriculture.''   Saggese said the British delegates suggested Argentinebusinessmen return the visit next year. He said trade between thetwo countries, about $850 million in 1981, now amounts to $100million a year, largely conducted through third countries.</TEXT></DOC>
