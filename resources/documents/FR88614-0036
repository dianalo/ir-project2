The Commission initiated this inquiry in response to petitions for rulemaking filed by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and severalother parties that raise issues addressing FM translator matters. In itspetition, the NAB requests further restrictions on FM translators to preventtheir use as a means to expand the service areas of primary FM stationsand tightened technical rules to prevent interference from translatorsto full-service stations. The other petitioning parties seek various formsof expansion of the current translator authority, including program originationauthority.2. The <T3>Notice </T3>indicates that the Commission's objective of this proceedingis to examine and, where necessary or appropriate, to revise its FM translatorpolicies to ensure that they are consistent with its overall FM allocationsplan. At the outset of this proceeding, the Commission emphasizes thatit does not intend to change its longstanding view that the proper roleof FM translators is to provide supplementary service to unserved and underservedareas, and to areas unable to receive satisfactory reception within thenormal predicted service areas of primary stations. In the <T3>Notice </T3>the Commission states that it is aware of the concernsexpressed by NAB and its supporters that translators may have an adversecompetitive and technical impact on the service provided by full-serviceFM stations and the possible need to strengthen the existing limitationson translator operation. It also notes that the requests of the other petitionersto increase use of FM translator facilities to provide new service to underservedareas and to serve the interests of specialized audiences may be generallyconsistent with the goal of maximizing the number and diversity of massmedia outlets. Thus, the <T3>Notice </T3>asks for public comment on all matters that may be relevantto the Commission's general FM translator policies and invites specificproposals for rules and regulations to implement any changes in these policies.3. In addition, the Commission imposed a general freeze on the acceptanceof application for new FM translators or major changes to existing FM translatorstations pending final resolution of this proceeding. The freeze will notapply to applications filed prior to the adoption of this <T3>Notice. </T3>Such applications will continue to be processed in accordancewith normal procedures. The Commission also is providing an exemption fromthe general freeze for new noncommercial, educational FM translators seekingassignment to the reserved frequency band in order to permit the implementationof the noncommercial signal delivery rule change adopted March 24, 1988,in the <T3>Report and Order </T3>in MM Docket 86-112, FCC 88-125.4.
