But this week's Paris conference reviewing the agreement takesplace with a clock grimly ticking. Each year, observers say, thelist of countries owning and developing chemical weapons grows. Andthe use of such weapons lies in the not-so-distant past.   Under strong international public pressure, the 1925 GenevaProtocol was reached banning the use of chemical weapons, and 118countries signed up. Sixty-four years later, delegates at theconference are reviewing the violations of the ban over the yearsand discussing ways to give it meaning and teeth.   The 1925 protocol covers only use. Most delegates here agree theworld also needs to ban development, production and storage of toxicagents. They also agree some organization, maybe the United Nations,should be able to check that countries are abiding by the ban andthat those violating it should be punished.   The need for an expanded international agreement on chemical andbiological arms has been recognized for a long time. Negotiatorshave been meeting periodically to come up with an accord for 17years.   When the last meeting in Geneva of the ad hoc committee onchemical weapons under the U.N. Conference on Disarmament closedApril 28 last year, nothing was ready to sign. Optimists said aconvention might be ready in another couple of years.   President Reagan, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly lastfall, called for the international conference. President FrancoisMitterrand, speaking a few days later, agreed to host it.   The 150 countries meeting in Paris hope they can find enoughcommon ground by Wednesday's close of their five-day meeting toissue a final document sending a clear political message to thenegotiators: The world wants a new accord.   The United States and the Soviet Union admit to having thousandsof tons in storage, but experts say at least 20 other countrieseither have poison arms or will before long.   Countries that have chemical weapons sell them to others thatdon't, some experts at the meeting say. And possible customersinclude terrorist groups.   ``Who wants chemical weapons?'' asked a U.S. expert, speaking oncondition he not be named. ``I can't give you a list but I can giveyou a set of criteria:   ``Anybody who's got a neighbor who has them. Anybody who has aresistence they want wiped out. Anybody with no chance of havingnuclear weapons. There are 40 or 50 countries that meet thatcriteria,'' he said.   Western officials say interest in developing toxic arms is keenin the Middle East. They say Iraq has used chemical weapons over thelast five years and has more experience with toxic agents anddeveloping ``delivery systems,'' than either the Soviet Union or theUnited States.   Condemned by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, theIraqi use of deadly poison is only the most recent example ofrepeated violations.   Others accused of breaking the agreement include Italy inEthiopia, Japan in China, Egypt in North Yemen, the United States inVietnam, the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, Libya in Chad and, if Nazigas chambers are included, Germany in the death camps of World WarII.   Intelligence sources say other countries having chemical weaponsinclude Syria, Iran, Israel, Egypt, North Korea, South Korea andTaiwan.</TEXT></DOC>
