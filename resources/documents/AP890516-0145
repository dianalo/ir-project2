The Energy Information Administration said in a special reporton the summer gasoline outlook that prices for all grades arelikely to average $1.09 a gallon, up from $1.05 now. The averageprice last summer was 99 cents a gallon, the report said.   Prices rose sharply immediately after the March 24 Exxon oiltanker spill in Alaska, which caused a brief drop in shipments ofNorth Slope crude oil, but then stabilized.   The additional price increases by summer will reflect a recentrise in crude oil prices paid by refiners and an estimated 1 centper gallon increase in state gasoline taxes, the report said.   Also putting upward pressure on prices should be the usualsummertime jump in gasoline demand, reaching a level 1.9 percenthigher than last summer, the agency said. The growth will result inpart from slower gains in auto fuel efficiency.   The report said that while gasoline supplies currently areadequate, a squeeze could develop this summer if increased importrequirements cannot be met. It said one-half of the anticipatedincrease in gasoline demand would have to be met by imports.</TEXT></DOC>
