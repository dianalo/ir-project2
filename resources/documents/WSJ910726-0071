Federal prosecutors have a wiretapped telephoneconversation, these persons said, that they believe indicatesthat Chairman Robert Daniell knew that inside Pentagoninformation provided by Mr. Paisley helped a UnitedTechnologies unit snare military engine business in 1987.</LP><TEXT>   While the company and two of its units previously wereidentified as part of a long-running criminal investigationof Pentagon corruption and bid-rigging, Mr. Daniell's namehadn't been linked to that probe.   Dan Harrison, a spokesman for United Technologies, saidMr. Daniell didn't have any comment, and the company didn'tmake available a lawyer representing the chairman. Mr.Daniell hasn't been charged with any crime, and lawyersfamiliar with the case said that the investigation is likelyto continue for at least several months.   The company is expected to tell prosecutors that thereference on the tape is ambiguous and that prosecutors havejumped to a conclusion that isn't warranted.   Mr. Harrison, the United Technologies spokesman, said, &quot;Wecontinue to believe that no UTC official knowingly receivedstolen information from Mr. Paisley.&quot; In discussions with theU.S. Attorney's Office in Alexandria, Va., which is leadingthe grand jury investigation, company lawyers have maintainedthat executives had a legitimate right to details about rivalGeneral Electric Co.'s bid to supply jet engines to the Navy.   Over the past few weeks, however, federal prosecutors havestepped up investigation of this portion of their nationwideprobe, dubbed &quot;Operation Ill Wind.&quot; They are trying todetermine whether the corruption and influence-peddlingscandal, which already has produced more than 50 criminalconvictions, reaches the highest rungs of the corporateladder.   Mr. Paisley, the No. 2 civilian in the Navy for most ofthe Reagan administration, pleaded guilty last month toaccepting bribes in exchange for helping steer contractspotentially worth more than $3 billion to two other largecontractors. He is cooperating with prosecutors.   When he left the Navy at the end of March 1987, Mr.Paisley took with him documents spelling out GE's bid tosupply engines for Navy combat planes. A month after leavingthe Pentagon, according to the government's statement offacts filed with Mr. Paisley's guilty plea, he passed theinformation to a high-ranking executive at UnitedTechnologies' Pratt andamp; Whitney engine-making unit.   &quot;If you can get over here, I'll make you happy,&quot; theofficial was told in a telephone conversation with Mr.Paisley and an associate, according to excerpts from thetaped conversation released by the government. &quot;I'll give yousome numbers.&quot;   The next day, the Pratt andamp; Whitney official called to thankMr. Paisley for the information. The official, according tothe documents, went on to say that he told a &quot;senior UTCofficial about Paisley's help,&quot; and that his superior was&quot;pleased with the numbers.&quot;   The U.S. Attorney's Office declined to identify the UTCofficial. But several persons familiar with the case saidthat prosecutors believe that Mr. Daniell is the &quot;senior UTCofficial&quot; referred to in the conversation.   The documents don't name the Pratt andamp; Whitney officialeither. But lawyers close to the case say he is EugeneTallia, who still works in the company's Washington officeand who dealt regularly with Mr. Paisley. Mr. Tallia'slawyer, Henry Schuelke, said his client &quot;never requested norreceived confidential procurement information from MelvynPaisley or anyone else.&quot;   With the benefit of GE's numbers, prosecutors contend,Pratt andamp; Whitney lowered its bid and eventually received a$111.2 million contract to supply 30% of the Navy's jetengine orders for the next year. The company's lawyerscontend that the GE numbers didn't give it any competitiveedge.</TEXT></DOC>
