PLC has drawn fire fromcritics who fear it might discourage foreign investment in thealready depressed London stock market.   The government says it acted to defend the free market against acartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, to whichKuwait belongs.   British Petroleum is Britain's largest company, and the PersianGulf nation of Kuwait is its biggest shareholder.   Representatives of big British brokerage firms charged that theaction departs from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's commitmentto letting the market alone.   ``The government's whole free-market policy is showing itself tobe either confused or shallow,'' said Humphrey Harrison, directorof energy research at the London investment firm Kitcat and Aitken.   ``Perhaps a new wave of protectionism is coming in, governmentintervention in what had been a free and open market,'' he said.   ``Uncertainty never helps investment,'' said Leo Doyle, aneconomist at the London investment firm Kleinwort Grieveson Ltd.``You might well see equity prices fall quite substantially. Ithink it's fair to say it's another nail in the coffin.''   The Kuwait Investment Office, the Gulf state's London-basedinvestment arm, was ordered on Tuesday to reduce its $5 billionstake in British Petroleum from 22 percent to 9.9 percent over thenext year.   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government said Kuwait's holdinglikely would conflict with the public interest. Analysts saidKuwait stood to lose nearly 400 million pounds ($676 million) inwhat would be one of the world's biggest divestitures.   The Kuwait government said only that it was considering itsoptions, but pro-government Kuwaiti newspapers urged retaliation.   The order could chill relations between the two countries, andsome analysts speculated that Kuwait would review all its Britishinvestments.   One-fifth of Kuwait's estimated $80 billion in overseasholidings are in Britain, including a recently disclosed 5.1 stakein Midland Bank PLC, one of Britan's largest commercial banks.   Critics in Britain called the decision inconsistent,hypocritical, punitive and ungrateful toward Kuwait, a long-timeBritish ally.   The Daily Telegraph quoted one unidentified analyst as saying itsmacked of a ``you can't trust the Arabs'' attitude.   But Trade Secretary Lord Young insisted the decision reaffirmedfree-market beliefs, saying Kuwait ``is a member of OPEC, one ofthe great cartels of the world. We will not be part of thatcartel.''   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, on whose recommendationthe government acted, expressed concerns that Kuwait might try toboost its own oil earnings by forcing British Petroleum to pumpless North Sea oil or cut exploration and development.   The conservative Financial Times supported the decision, saying,``the rules were properly applied, the argument was fair and theoutcome correct.''   Mrs. Thatcher, a strong advocate of free-market policies, haspresided over a capitalist revolution in Britain since takingoffice in 1979, selling off state-owned industries and encouragingpublic share-ownership.   In addition, when the government reviews large acquisitions ofBritish shares, it is usually with the aim of safeguardingcompetition.   At the same time Britain has a history of retaining ``goldenshares'' which guarantee ultimate control of companies it views asstrategically vital.   It also has limited foreign holdings to a total of 15 percent inother privatizations.   But, ``there is a fundamental difference (in the BritishPetroleum case),'' Harrison said. In previous cases, ``those thingswere notified in advance, with the foreign investor knowing inadvance what the terms and conditions were.''   It is common on Britain's takeover scene for British targets offoreign bidders to wage emotional campaigns to keep themselvesBritish. The opposition Labor party also is always quick to raisenational sentiments when attacking the government's free-marketpolicies.   What prompted outcry over the government's British Petroleumdecision was the fact that Kuwait had made unsolicited, legallybinding pledges not to increase its stake or to use it to ``furtherany other commercial or political interest of Kuwait.''   Also, Kuwait's purchase of the 1.316 billion shares had bailedthe government out of an embarrassing situation last fall.   Kuwait's intervention relieved the government from having tofulfill its potentially costly promise to buy back unsold BritishPetroleum shares after its sale of its one-third stake in the oilgiant coincided with the stock market crash and flopped, leavingunderwriters holding large amounts of stock.   Harrison said the government has twice intervened against thefree market in British Petroleum's case _ first by guaranteeing tobuy back unsold shares, and now by its action against Kuwait.   ``Why privatize British Petroleum if it's of such strategicsignificance?'' he asked, noting that the government didn't retaina golden share or previously limit foreign holdings in BritishPetroleum.   Many analysts also were shocked by the size of the reductionordered, saying they had expected a cut to 15 percent, and by thedeadline set for disposing of the shares.   Unless the government extends the time period for Kuwait to sellthe 700 million British Petroleum shares, the effect on thepost-crash market will be ``quite serious,'' Harrison said.   ``There is going to be a perception that maybe we've reached thezenith of the free market, certainly a perception by foreigninvestors that competition policy is by no means well-defined,'' hesaid.   ``It will knock London as a financial center,'' Harrison charged.</TEXT></DOC>
