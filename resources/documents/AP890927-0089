Monitor on IRAs' tax advantage:   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's presidential aspirations could meantax breaks for millions of Americans.   Bentsen's plan restores part of the IRA's tax advantage. Itwould allow anyone to put up to $2,000 per year in an IRA whilepaying taxes on half that amount. Taxes would have to be paid onwithdrawals from IRAs to pay for a first home or college expenses,but no penalty for early withdrawal would be incurred.   For financial reasons alone, Bentsen's expansion of IRAs is farpreferable to (President) Bush's cut in the capital gains tax.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 26   The Kansas City (Mo.) Times on taxing pension fund transactions:   The latest loony tax idea coming out of Washington would slap atax on short-term stock transactions by pension funds.   As one fund manager put it recently, `It's the camel's noseunder the tent.''   He's right. ... A breach in the tax-exempt status of pensionfunds could set off a feeding frenzy by Congress; imagine all thatcash, just laying around for the taxman.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 26   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on chemical weapons:   President Bush received a ringing ovation by representatives ofthe nations around the world when he called chemical weapons a``scourge'' of the Earth.   The proposal he unveiled before the United Nations GeneralAssembly to destroy more than 80 percent of the United States'stockpile of those weapons if the Soviets reduce arsenals to anequal level is praiseworthy. But it's not as sterling an ambitionas his wish to have international treaties ban the weapons entirely.   The president's proposed ban makes sense.   Militarily, the use of deadly chemicals is a repugnantalternative. Unlike other weapons, lethal gases cannot be carefullytargeted. They know no boundaries, save the wind. ...   Sooner or later, chemical weapons could find their way into thehands of terrorists.   The president said more than 20 nations have chemical weapons orthe capability to produce them.   ``For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse thisthreat,'' the president said.   We couldn't agree more.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 22   Los Angeles Times on the Gorbachev revolution:   The Soviet Union may be heading for a second October Revolution,this one little more than a year from now when a Communist PartyCongress convenes ahead of schedule for the purpose of packing theimportant Central Committee with people who are more in step withMikhail S. Gorbachev's reformist plans.   Moving up the date of the next congress by some months wasapproved at (last) week's Central Committee meeting. Also approvedwas a shakeup in the party's ruling Politburo that should work tofurther consolidate Gorbachev's power.   Steadily and surely, the opponents of change, along with ineptand unpopular regional leaders, are being pensioned off in favor ofGorbachev loyalists. The October, 1990 party congress is expectedto advance or even complete the consolidation process by providingGorbachev with the instrument he needs under party rules to fillvacancies on the Central Committee with his supporters.   For all the talk of powerful opposition to his (economic andpolitical) reform efforts and even widely reported rumors of plotsto oust him from office, Gorbachev thus seems to have emergedstronger and more in charge than ever before. ...   The downside could be that in reshaping the party and governmentleadership in his own image, Gorbachev will lose what until now hadbeen a built-in excuse for not making more effective progress morequickly.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 20   The Daily Journal, Vineland, N.J., on the Federal ElectionCommission:   It should come as no surprise that the Federal ElectionCommission, set up in 1974 to enforce federal campaign laws,apparently has not been doing its job.   (A Common Cause study) said that the commission has sanctionedcampaign activities that run counter to central provisions of thepost-Watergate reform laws, including the state's campaigncontribution and expenditure limit.   The six-member commission has on a number of occasions evenrejected the advice of its attorneys, who have argued forenforcement of the law.   The commission's real flaw is the people who sit on it. Andgiven the widespread inattention to ethics throughout governmentthese days, we're not sure how that one will be solved _ except bythrowing the blackguards out.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 20   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on the Brontosaurus stamp:   The Postal Service is in trouble with some people for puttingout a stamp with a picture of a dinosaur labeled ``Brontosaurus.''Scientists say the correct name for what is popularly known asbrontosaurus is apatosaurus. ...   (One expert in paleobiology at the Smithsonian Museum of NaturalHistory) said such willful disregard for the correct name of ananimal ``suggests that the Postal Service cares little for theaccuracy of the stamps (it issues and it prefers) `cartoon'nomenclature to scientific nomenclature.'' ...   Our office ... dictionary ... carries nothing under apatosaurus,but under brontosaurus features a drawing of the beast and adefinition.   If (scientists) want the world to get these names straight,perhaps they should start with the dictionary publishers. ...   The Postal Service's ``error'' will provide a benefit: ... Thecontroversy accompanying their issue will produce more instantknowledge about this question of nomenclature _ among both childrenand adults _ than could ever be achieved by books or classes.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
