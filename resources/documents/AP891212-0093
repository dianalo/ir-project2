(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Ford Motor Co. executive saidtoday a protective cage around the fuel tank of a church busprobably would not have prevented a fire that killed 27 people.   The testimony came at Larry Mahoney's trial on 27 counts ofmurder in a wrong-way collision between the bus and Mahoney'spickup. His attorneys say he unknowingly may have drunkvodka-spiked soda pop before the May 14, 1988 crash.   Twenty-four youngsters and three adults died in the accident onInterstate 71 near here after flames consumed the bus from theRadcliff First Assembly of God Church.   Although a cage probably would not have prevented the fire,former Ford vice president Thomas Feahney testified, ``there wastechnology available that could have prevented this tragicaccident.'' He did not elaborate.   The automotive engineer said the impact caused gasoline tosquirt ``like a flame thrower'' into the passenger section.   On Monday, defense attorneys sought to establish that the formerschool bus had safety defects that caused it to burst into flames.The victims died of smoke inhalation or burns rather than ofinjuries from the impact.   ``Part of the defense has been the claim of involuntaryintoxication,'' defense attorney William Summers told reporters,explaining the significance of testimony that a friend gave Mahoneya cocktail of Diet Pepsi and vodka.   ``To voluntarily drink something, you've got to have some ideaof what you're drinking,'' Summers said.   Mahoney, 36, a factory worker from rural Owen County, is chargedwith 27 counts of murder, 12 of assault, 42 of wanton endangermentand one of drunken driving.   His blood-alcohol level after the crash tested as high as 0.24percent _ nearly 2{ times the state's definition of intoxication,according to earlier testimony.   Among those testifying Monday was Phil Downey, a longtime friendof Mahoney's who was with him at a gathering he left less than anhour before the 10:55 p.m. crash.   Downey recalled Mahoney asking Kelly Osborne, a friend at thegathering, what he was drinking. He said Osborne gave Mahoney a cupof Diet Pepsi and vodka, saying, ``This is better for you than anyld beer you ever drank.''   Mahoney drank the mixture, Downey testified.   Under cross-examination by Assistant Attorney General PaulRichwalsky Jr., Downey said Mahoney appeared drunk when he droveaway.   ``He shouldn't have been driving,'' Downey said.   Summers said he would try to prove Mahoney didn't know what wasin the cup.   The defense contends unsafe design of the 1977 school bus is toblame for the deaths. A federal investigation after the crash foundthe bus's exposed fuel tank prone to fire.   Also testifying Monday was state Fire Marshal John WilliamMartin, who said the fire wouldn't have been prevented by aprotective cage around the bus' gas tank. The blaze erupted after apiece of the bus's suspension punctured the tank.   Martin said it couldn't be determined if the thick black smokethat filled the bus and was blamed for most of the deaths wascaused by the burning of gasoline alone or the burning of plasticseat covers and cushions.</TEXT></DOC>
