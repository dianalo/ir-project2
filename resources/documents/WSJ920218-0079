The region is beset by high illiteracy and school dropoutrates. Southeast states still graduate only 67% of highschoolers, compared with 71% for the whole U.S. Yetretraining and educational improvement efforts are spotty andpoorly funded. BellSouth finds &quot;the overwhelming majority&quot; ofjob applicants flunk entry-level exams.</LP><TEXT>   Over a third of college freshmen take remedial reading,writing or math, according to the Southern Regional EducationBoard. &quot;Plants that modernize have to go back and teach basicmath,&quot; says Southern Technology Council Director StuartRosenfeld, adding: &quot;People don't understand fractions, letalone statistical process control.&quot;   Low skills are &quot;our Achilles' heel,&quot; says George Autry,head of MDC Inc., a Chapel Hill, N.C., think-tank.                                                                                                          TRAINING PROGRAMS offer a glimmer of hope.   Phoenix Specialty Manufacturing Co., in Bamburg, S.C.,sees &quot;far fewer errors&quot; and greater productivity since anon-site schooling program began in 1988. With employeestaking high-school equivalency classes during work hours andinspecting their own work, Phoenix was able to pare its workforce to 130 from 170 without cutting production.   Dropout rates in Richmond County, N.C., fell to 13% in1991 from 28% in 1986, under a pilot program that coordinateshigh-school and community-college technical studies. Theprogram puts tougher math, science and other demands onhigh-school students. &quot;Kids are focused on something theywant to do,&quot; says Joseph Grimsley, president of RichmondCommunity College.                                                                                                          HEAVY FOREIGN INVESTMENT aids job growth, helping bufferthe recession.   Foreign firms continue to flock to the South, where statestout their nonunion labor force, good climate and strong workethic. In South Carolina, 8% of jobs stem from foreignownership. Spartanburg, S.C., snared another potential 200jobs in January, when Germany's Helvetion Internationalagreed to move its U.S. headquarters there from New York.   Florida says foreign investment accounts for 96,869 jobs,up from 74,922 in mid-1989, despite a 1.2% decline in totaljobs last year. There are fewer local objections to foreignownership in the South than in some other areas.   In Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana, though,only between 13 and 18 jobs per 1,000 are export-related,compared with 23 per 1,000 nationally.                                                                                                          JOBLESS PAY plays a lesser role in the South. ElevenSouthern states had an average insured-unemployment rate of2.5% in last year's second quarter, compared with 3.1%nationwide. They paid average weekly compensation of $140,compared with $170, according to a compilation by consultantLaurdan Associates; 28% of Southern claimants exhaustedregular benefits, compared with 33% nationwide.                                                                                                          DEPARTING PROFS: Florida's fiscally strained stateuniversities suffer an exodus of professors due to low pay,cuts in travel and materials and lagging support forresearch. &quot;Everyone is concerned we're going to lose themomentum built up in competing for research money andattracting good educators,&quot; says James Parry, a systemofficial.   ATLANTA COUNTS on the 1996 Summer Olympics to spurconstruction, security, hotel, restaurant and retail jobs.Some 84,000 will be generated, says Jeffrey Humphreys, aUniversity of Georgia economist. But Donald Ratajczak, aGeorgia State University economist, sees no &quot;long-term jobopportunity.&quot;                                                                                                          MIAMI'S PROFESSIONALS take their skills to Latin America.Lawyers, bankers, architects, engineers and interiordesigners add clients in Latin America. Business from downsouth &quot;just lands at our doorstep,&quot; says Luis Ajamil, anarchitectural engineer.                                                                                                          UNIONS FIGHT an uphill organizing battle in the South.   The Southeast is &quot;by far still the least organized&quot;region, says Richard Ray, the Georgia AFL-CIOsecretary-treasurer. Right-to-work laws remain a majorhurdle. Unions face an &quot;ingrained belief in the South thatunions are inherently evil,&quot; a Ladies Garment Workersofficial says.   But organizers see heightened interest in unions. The AutoWorkers won an election to represent 3,000 workers at MurrayOhio Manufacturing Co. in Tennessee. Employees newlyorganized by the Ladies Garment Workers at two units of S.Lichtenberg andamp; Co. in Georgia, a drapery and curtain maker,won a tentative contract in October.   The AFL-CIO's industrial union department won 27 of 48drives in the Southeast in 1991; it was especially successfulin low-pay &quot;sweatshops.&quot;                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: A ban on voice mail by Chairman EdwardCrutchfield of First Union Corp., a Charlotte, N.C., bankconcern, spawns customer suggestions that he be named Man ofthe Year or run for president. . . .
