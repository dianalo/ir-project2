Starting in 1995, plants thatpollute less than their ceiling amounts can sell pollutionrights to plants that exceed them.   Initially skeptical, many power companies are nowrecognizing that trading allowances could produce substantialsavings for customers and shareholders. But some remain wary.&quot;I fear a spastic market if it isn't free and open, if it istoo small, or if there are mismatches of supply and demand,&quot;says Paul Dragoumis, executive vice president of PotomacElectric Power.   Helping spur interest is the prospect of participation inallowance-trading markets by Citicorp, Merrill Lynch,Shearson Lehman Brothers, Price Waterhouse and others. TheChicago Board of Trade is studying the potential for spot andfutures markets. Air Products andamp; Chemicals, in a venture withMitsubishi to provide advanced scrubber technology to powerplants, proposes to accept allowances as partial payment.   The Environmental Protection Agency expects to proposeimplementation rules by early September. For utilities, thecalculations won't be simple. Whether a company has enoughpollution credits to meet its needs will depend on severalfactors, including costs of conversion to cleaner fuels andinvestment in more emission-control equipment. Estimates ofthe market value of allowances range from $250 to $1,100 aton annually, representing a potential market of billions ofdollars.                                                                                                          Big Apple Takes a Look   At the Compost Heap                                                                                                          NEW YORK CITY is about to wade into the compostingbusiness.   Some 3,500 households in the Park Slope area of Brooklynwill be recruited for a pilot program to sort their foodwastes, tissue paper, tea bags and coffee filters. Wastesfrom residents of the medium-density neighborhood will gointo compostable bags that aren't supposed to leak or stinkfor at least a week.   Trucks will collect the bags from covered containers atcurbside and haul them to a 43-acre site on Staten Island,where the wastes will be dumped into thick rows of leaves andmixed by giant rototillers. The composting &quot;recipe&quot; calls fora temperature of 132 degrees Fahrenheit to destroy fly eggsand discourage vermin.   &quot;Bacteria release energy that produces the heat,&quot; saysThomas Outerbridge, a city planner helping to develop theprogram. &quot;It's important to maintain the temperature to killoff pathogens.&quot;   Collaborating on the project are experienced compostersfrom Woods End Laboratory, Mount Vernon, Maine, and OrganicRecycling, Valley Cottage, N.Y. The city doesn't havedefinite plans yet for using the compost.   Woods End, which has had considerable experience incomposting potato culls and fishery wastes, says it expectsrecycled and composted materials to play an increasinglyimportant role as soil additives. Besides, burgeoninglandfills are a problem for many cities, so New York'sexperiment will be monitored widely.                                                                                                          Park Service Celebrates   With a Complaint Box                                                                                                          THE NATIONAL Park Service is celebrating its 75thanniversary by inviting criticism and suggestions on how toimprove.   At a recent symposium hosted by the National Parks andConservation Association, experts produced a long list oftasks and issues needing attention. Among them: heaviervisitor traffic, a mounting maintenance backlog, encroachmentby developers and problems with employee diversity andretention.   In the past few years, the backlog of repair andrenovation projects has climbed to $2 billion. AtIndependence Hall, the roof leaks. A building at MartinLuther King National Park collapsed from neglect. Anabandoned uranium mine in Grand Canyon National Park withinadequate shielding gives off low-level radiation near avisitors path.   The 357 National Park sites have more than 250 millionvisitors a year. Volume is projected to double within 20years. Yellowstone's annual traffic has increased about600,000 to 2.8 million since the fires of 1988.   Yale historian Robin Winks calls for new sites to&quot;commemorate and protect new themes&quot; as more immigrantsarrive and the nation's demography changes. West VirginiaUniversity's Barbara Howe suggests parks recognizecontributions of Asian Americans and Hispanics.   &quot;We can't continue forever expanding our national parksystem,&quot; says the service's director, James M. Ridenour. Hewarns of &quot;thinning the blood&quot; by adding units that are &quot;lessthan nationally significant.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          BATTELLE MEMORIAL Institute in Columbus, Ohio, hasdeveloped a recycling technology that mixes various plasticsto produce reusable materials. Conventional recycling methodsare costly because they require separating plastics by types.In contrast, the Battelle method uses a thermal reactor tobreak down the mixed polymers into molecular gases that canbe easily separated and turned into virgin plastic. . . .Greenpeace vows to deploy its fleet to blockade shipments oftropical timber. The group says research it's conducting willdetermine how much tropical forest is being destroyed and&quot;which Japanese, American and European corporations are doingit.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
