Sun, already the leading maker of computer workstations,plans to announce today that by the middle of next year, itwill release a modified version of its basic software for useon the tens of millions of PCs built around microprocessorsfrom Intel Corp. The move will pit Sun's operating system, avariant of Unix, against a future offering from Microsoftcalled Windows NT, which is expected to be released nextyear, too.</LP><TEXT>   In many ways, Sun and Microsoft have been the growth starsof the computer industry in recent years. Sun grew at adizzying pace in the 1980s and finished its fiscal year endedJune 30 as the sluggish computer industry's top growthcompany with net income of $190 million on $3.2 billion inrevenue. But the company has repeatedly beseeched Microsoft,the king of software, to write applications for itscomputers. Microsoft has repeatedly rebuffed Sun, sniffingthat the computer maker's volumes are too small.   The rivalry between the two companies is personal. ScottMcNealy, Sun's chief executive officer, has often lashed outat William Gates III, Microsoft's chairman and chiefexecutive officer, for dictating PC standards. Mr. Gatescounters that Sun doesn't have a big enough following. In abid at diplomacy, the two met last month at Sun's MountainView, Calif., headquarters, but the talks resolved little.And ironically, Mr. McNealy is a close friend of SteveBallmer, Microsoft's second-in-command and Mr. Gates's ownclosest confidant; the two attended Harvard Universitytogether as undergraduates.   Analysts said Sun's move into operating software shouldpose a stiff test for the nine-year-old wunderkind. &quot;Quitefrankly, the biggest danger {in the move} is to Sun,&quot; saysStewart Alsop, editor of PC Letter. &quot;Sun has gotten where itis precisely because it has been so focused.&quot;   Rivals also insist Sun faces a rude awakening in operatingsystem software, which controls the basic functions of acomputer, such as how files are stored and retrieved. &quot;It's arealization that Sun isn't generating enough volume on itsown. It can't ignore PCs,&quot; says Carl Stork, Microsoft'sproduct manager for advanced operating systems.   Others say Sun was driven to put its software on Intelhardware by a series of industry alliances, which seemeddesigned to isolate Sun from slower-growing rivals CompaqComputer Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. &quot;I think Sun is feeling left out,&quot;says Larry Michels, president of Santa Cruz Operations Inc.,which currently sells the most popular version of the Unixoperating system for PCs.   Mr. McNealy disagrees Sun's move is reactive, sayingcustomers are clamoring for a robust operating system thatgets the most out of a new generation of computer hardware,epitomized by Intel's 486 processor. Mr. McNealy says heexpects owners of high-powered Intel-based PCs, made by suchconcerns as Dell Computer Corp., Compaq and AST ResearchInc., to flock to Sun's operating system, because it providesadvanced capabilities, such as the ability to run multipleprograms simultaneously, something that Microsoft is stillonly promising with its Windows NT.   According to Mr. McNealy, who is known for pepperingrivals with sharp comments, Windows NT &quot;stands for not there.I don't know when it will appear or what it will do.&quot;(Microsoft says NT, which actually stands for &quot;newtechnology,&quot; should be in the hands of customers before theend of 1992.)   Presently, Sun's software can only work on computerspowered by microprocessors in the Sun-designed Sparc family.Sparc-based computers have won a big following amongengineers and scientists, but Mr. McNealy is increasinglyknocking on the door of large corporations, which arebeginning to adopt Sun computers for a variety of commercialtasks, such as computerized investing.   Robert Herwick, an analyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quist, said thatgiven Sun's success, it was natural that the company wouldtry to move its operating system onto Intel's hardware -- ifonly as an attempt to create more demand for Sun's hardware.&quot;Ultimately, Sun's objective is to get commercial usersmoving from {Microsoft's Windows} to Unix,&quot; Mr. Herwick said.While the move &quot;is not going to make Sun a lot of money inthe short run,&quot; he added, &quot;it creates some interestingoptions down the road,&quot; including making it easy for Sun toshift some of its own business to Intel chips in the future.   The salvo from Sun is the latest threat to Microsoft'sgrip over operating systems, which are a crucial element inthe desktop computer business, because the choice of anoperating system dictates the kind of applications softwareand even the type of microprocessor used. In the 1980s,Microsoft dominated desktop operating software with its DOSprogram, and in May of 1990 it introduced a popularenhancement to DOS called Windows. Now Microsoft is buildingits future operating systems around the core of Windows.   In July, Apple and IBM announced they planned to jointlydevelop a new operating system that will compete with WindowsNT. About the same time, Novell Inc. purchased DigitalResearch, which makes a clone of Microsoft's DOS. Separately,IBM has a campaign on to revive OS/2, another operatingsystem designed for high-end PCs, and as part of the effortBig Blue is disparaging Windows NT.   Industry observers think Microsoft is an odds-on favoriteto retain a great deal of the operating system business, butit's increasingly likely that this business will be dividedamong several rivals, a sharp contrast to Microsoft'sunchallenged position of the past.   In the fragmented software market of the 1990s, Intel mayfare better. The Santa Clara, Calif., company is the biggestsupplier, by far, of microprocessors for desktop computers.But Intel is increasingly pressed by competing suppliers,such as Mips Computer Systems and Sun itself, which offermore powerful chips. In response, Intel is piling upendorsements from suppliers of operating systems. Besidesworking on Sun's operating system, Intel chips are expectedto support the new operating system to be produced by theApple-IBM partnership.   Intel's strategy may keep it on top by ensuring that themost popular spreadsheets, databases and other applicationsare easily available on its hardware. &quot;I don't think peoplebuy PCs for the microprocessor or the operating system,&quot; saysMichael Dell, chief executive of Dell Computer. &quot;I think theybuy applications.&quot;   For the same reason, Mr. Dell is offering Sun's operatingsystem for sale in order to grab those fans of the more than3,000 applications written for Sun's machines.</TEXT></DOC>
