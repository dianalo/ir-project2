(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists are studying a way to ``tag''smokestack pollutants much the way biologists tag birds and animalsas part of research into pinpointing the chemicals that contributeto acid rain.   In tests begun last summer, W. Robert Kelly of the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology and University of Marylandaerosol chemist John Ondov injected an enriched, or strengthened,isotope of the metal neodymium into smoke from a coal-burning powerplant in northern Virginia.   Analysis showed that air filters at sampling sites in an arc fromBethesda to Landover ``detected the release of the enriched isotope20 kilometers from the power plant,'' Kelly said. The experimentproved ``we can inject it into the smokestack, take samples into thelab and detect the effect.''   Kelly and Ondov are seeking an Environmental Protection Agencygrant to study whether the particle tracing will work over longerdistances. The EPA is testing isotope tracers in diesel fuel used bypublic vehicles in Roanoke, Va.   Plants could be injected with different isotopes to help trackthe pollutants each one produces. Imagine each isotope is a coloredping pong ball, Kelly said. ``You can count the relative numbers ofblue, green and red balls, and say, `Aha! The plant in Town A, eventhough it is further away, is the source of 10 times the number ofballs as the plant right next door.'''   Acid rain is formed from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxidereleased by the combustion of coal and other fossil fuels. Incombination with water, they form nitric acid gas and sulfuric aciddroplets, which dissolve in rain.   The research was funded by the utility industry's Electric PowerResearch Institute and Maryland's Power Plant Topical ResearchProgram.</TEXT><HEAD>White Sands Missile Range To House Nuclear Blast Simulator</HEAD><DATELINE>WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Defense Nuclear Agencyhopes to start testing the durability of military equipment by 1994in a $74 million device that will simulate the heat and shock wavesof a nuclear blast.   The blast simulator will consist of a 894-foot-long tube, 66 feetin diameter, connected to a test chamber big enough to hold a tankor helicopter, said spokeswoman Cheri Abdelnour. The other end ofthe tube will be fitted with nine high-pressure valves that willcreate a shock wave of compressed nitrogen; torches burning oxygenand aluminum powder will create short blasts of heat.   The device will be able to bombard objects with energy as strongas 600 kiloton blasts _ 30 times the power of the bomb thatdevastated Hiroshima.   Construction could start in two years, at a site on the northwestcorner of the missile range chosen after a year-long study,Abdelnour said.</TEXT><HEAD>Archaeologist Disputes Popular View of Mammoth Hunts</HEAD><DATELINE>CASPER, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An archaeologist who went to Africa to teststone tools used 11,000 years ago in North America says modernpainting of mammoth hunts are based largely on misconceptions aboutthe hunters' abilities.   Paintings, dioramas and even textbooks often show mammoths up totheir tusks in swamps with hunters rushing around, waving spears andyelling, said George Frison, ``and usually somebody being trampledto death.''   This almost certainly was not the typical hunting method ofClovis cultures that lived in the Wyoming area, said the Universityof Wyoming professor.   The short spears and lances found at Clovis-period sites could beused to kill and skin mammoths, Frison said, but the huntersprobably went after young, stray animals to avoid facing chargingherds of the 15,000-pound creatures.   Assuming that mammoths had a social structure similar to Africanelephants, a Clovis-culture hunt would probably proceed verydifferently. Elephants have a strong family structure in which thematriarch is protector of the herd. At the sign of danger, thematriarch will charge, six or more tons of enraged elephant bearingdown on the hunter, armed only with a stone-tipped spear. ``You'renot going to down a charging matriarch with Clovis weaponry,''Frison said.   Consequently, the only way Clovis hunters could routinely havekilled mammoths would be by going after younger animals away fromthe herd. Hunters would have worked in pairs, one distracting theanimal without threatening it, and the other sneaking up on it todeliver the fatal wound, he said. They would then hide until theanimal died and the herd left.   Frison, testing his theories on dead elephants in Zimbabwe, foundthat Clovis spears and lances could pierce an elephant's hide from60 feet. A spear that pierced a mammoth's lungs would probably killit within minutes, while one that pierced the stomach would takehours to days to cause death, he said.   Frison said no one can really know the Clovis techniques but thatthis is more likely than the screaming tribal charge often depictedby artists.   ``Clovis really represents the development of true huntingweaponry,'' Frison said, a conclusion he admits is controversialamong those who studied early humans in Europe, Africa and Asia.``If you're really talking about the kind of hunting that one or twohunters bring down a mammoth,'' he said, ``it developed in the newworld.''</TEXT></DOC>
