Traders were divided about the short-term outlook but remained generally bearish even though the U.S. currency has risen in three of the past four trading sessions.    &quot;All that happened was an upward correction within a bear trend,&quot; Albert Soria, vice president of Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said. &quot;I don't see anything that bodes well for the dollar.&quot;    The dollar started its climb early in the day and at one time drew close to 144.50 Japanese yen and 1.82 West German marks. But traders found resistance at those levels, and the dollar slipped back to 143.78 yen and 1.8140 marks in late New York trading.    The dollar was quoted at 144.20 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    Traders noted a variety of reasons for the dollar's buoyancy yesterday. They said the lack of a strong signal from U.S. officials that would allow the dollar to slip further has kept traders from aggressively pushing the currency down.    &quot;People seem to be waiting for the slightest lack of resolve on the part of officials,&quot; Douglas Madison, a corporate trader at BankAmerica International in New York, said.    Some traders focused on speculation that U.S. lawmakers are near an agreement to amend the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The U.S. budget deficit has been a continuing drag on the dollar's value.    Traders also said they are wary of next week's meetings of the U.S. and its major allies in Washington. Arthur C. Agostini, vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said he expects the dollar to remain in its current narrow range until then.    &quot;As we get closer and closer to these meetings, the political rhetoric is going to determine what the market is going to do,&quot; he said.    James T. McGroarty, vice president at Discount Corp. of New York, is more bearish. He said he expects a &quot;slow deterioration&quot; of the dollar until the Washington talks and said the major economic powers then will accept that slightly lower level for the dollar.    &quot;Every time you look at these ranges, they're a little bit lower,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as you don't lose confidence in investment flows, it doesn't matter if the number is 130 yen. It's just that you get there in an orderly manner.&quot;    Many traders continued to worry about protectionist legislation being considered in Congress as an antidote to the U.S. trade deficit. Some traders fear a trade bill that would hurt the dollar, and others say the administration is willing to let the dollar fall further to avoid such legislation.    &quot;Either way, the dollar must come down,&quot; Mr. Soria said.    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a news conference in Tokyo that the recent stability of foreign-exchange rates shows that the market respects the efforts of major nations to enforce international financial accords. His allusion to central bank intervention helped prop the dollar up, some traders said.    At a New York news conference, Mathis Cabiallavetta, an executive vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland, said he expects the U.S. trade deficit to improve over time. But he questioned whether it will narrow enough to compensate for the &quot;foreign debt being built up day by day.&quot;    He said that if there are signs of improvement in the U.S. trade deficit, further signs of credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve and stronger U.S. economic growth, &quot;it wouldn't surprise me if we got a rising dollar in the next few months.&quot; But in the long run, he said, the outlook &quot;is rather gloomy&quot; for the dollar. &quot;The fundamentals are on the downside,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 80 cents an ounce to $457.80 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $458.15 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     Late New York Trading                   Wednesday, Sept. 16, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
