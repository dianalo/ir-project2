KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republicans on the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee, angered by a Democratic-led probe into ambassadorialnominee Donald Gregg's alleged involvement in the Iran-Contraaffair, are leading a boycott that is paralyzing the panel.   The boycott of committee meetings is preventing action on twopending authorization bills providing a total $16 billionauthorization for foreign aid and State Department spending.   Democrats say they may retaliate by blocking action on alldiplomatic and State Department appointments, including nominationsfor key posts the administration wants to fill quickly.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is spurring the Gregginvestigation, told reporters: ``We may not determine anything forawhile; this committee may not have any hearings on anything,including Gregg.''   ``If this committee can't meet on anything else, maybe thecommittee also can't meet on Gregg,'' Cranston said.   Republicans opened the tug-of-war on Tuesday, boycotting aworking session and preventing action on a pending $4.5 billionauthorization bill for the State Department and other agencies. Alsofrozen by the standoff was a two-year, $11.5 billion foreign aidauthorization bill.   The investigation is focusing on Gregg's alleged links to theIran-Contra affair while serving as national security adviser forVice President Bush.   The key questions are:   _Did Gregg help Oliver L. North secretly and illegally resupplythe Nicaraguan Contra rebels in 1985?   _Is he lying about it now?   On Tuesday, eight Democrats gathered to try to act on the StateDepartment bill.   The only Republican present was Sen. Jesse Helms of NorthCarolina, the panel's ranking GOP member, and he walked out. Aquorum of 10 members is necessary to permit the committee to act onpending legislation or nominations.   ``It's very apparent that we are unable to do business becausethe Republicans are objecting to the fact that a legitimatecommittee inquiry is taking place with respect to Mr. Don Gregg,''said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.   Kerry said Republicans in the past have held up certainnominations for months, yet Democrats continued to permit thecommittee to get on with its other work.   ``I think the process is subjected to a kind of tyranny when ...there is this wholesale boycotting,'' Kerry said.   ``I would hope the comity of this institution would not lead toother important business being held up ...,'' he said.   Cranston complained that a lack of cooperation from theadministration is delaying final action on Gregg, saying he has hadno response to requests for documents and information relating toGregg.   ``The administration seems to me to be showing some contempt forthe committee in this particular matter,'' Cranston said.   Helms said the boycott is being organized by Sen. MitchMcConnell, R-Ky., who, Helms said, wants a specific date set forholding another hearing on Gregg and a specific date for voting onhis nomination.   ``I don't want any suggestions made that we're holding upanything,'' Helms said. ``Sen. Cranston is holding up. ... He's gota vendetta going against Mr. Gregg.''   ``This is an attempt to dredge up Iran-Contra again'' said Helms.``I'm having a problem on my side because of their discontent overwhat Sen. Cranston is doing. I think Sen. McConnell's indignation iswell justified.''   At that point, Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., attempted to movefor action on the pending State Department bill.   Would Helms agree? he asked.   Helms stood up.   ``I'll see you later, Mr. Chairman,'' he said, walking from theroom. ``I've got to defend my side.''</TEXT></DOC>
