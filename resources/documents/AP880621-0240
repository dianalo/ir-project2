Reagan acknowledged that ``there are some differences ofopinion'' on agricultural subsidies but said, ``I am not going togive up on that.'' Showing no regrets over the final communique, hesaid, ``I'm just surprised we got it done.''   The three-day summit was Reagan's last, and Canadian PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney thanked the president on behalf of theWestern leaders.   ``His leadership has been strong, his accomplishmentssubstantial and his place in history secure ... We shall all misshis warmth and his wisdom,'' Mulroney said after reading the finalcommunique.   Proclaiming their talks a benefit for the entire world, thesummit leaders agreed to launch a new, seven-year cycle of summitsin France next year, beginning July 14, the bicentennial of thestart of the French Revolution, and running three days.   Conferring around an octagonal table in a windowless, basementroom of Toronto's convention center, the leaders met for nearlythree hours _ an hour longer than scheduled. ``It was a veryvigorous exchange of views that produced a very substantialdocument,'' said Mulroney, the host of the summit conference.   Members of their delegations had worked through the night tofinish the final communique, completing work on the 34-paragraphdocument at 5 a.m. EDT.   It contained no surprises or breakthroughs.   At a news conference after the close of the summit, Reagan saidhe thought the U.S. policy of seeking to ease governmentalregulation and tax burdens for business has sent a message to therest of the industrialized world and that ``today, it defines theconsensus of the summit nations'' on economic strategy.   In a speech Tuesday night, before leaving Toronto, Reagan toldan audience of wealthy Canadian business executives he hoped theindustrialized democracies would expand free trade and steer clearof ``the protection and isolation that are relics of another age.''   Displaying fascination with the technological revolution, Reagannoted that a tiny silicon chip has the same power of the biggestcomputers of the 1960s. ``Do we dare stop climbing?'' he asked.   Despite the outward appearance of harmony, there were some sharpdifferences among the leaders.   French President Francois Mitterrand, at a closing newsconference, accused the United States of trying to transform thesummit into a permanent body that would try to run the world.   Citing Reagan's call for a seven-nation drug task force, hesaid, ``In whose name do these seven countries decide for the restof the world?''   But he said his confrontations with Reagan on this and otherissues _ farm subsidies and aid to the Philippines _ ``did notexceed reasonable bounds.''   The communique said the leaders approved a plan allowingcreditor countries to choose from a menu of options in grantingdebt relief to 20 to 30 nations of sub-Saharan Africa.   On the agricultural subsidies issue, however, they stopped farshort of Reagan's proposal to eliminate subsidies by the year 2000,an idea staunchly opposed by European nations and Japan.   Instead, the leaders said negotiators must develop ``a frameworkapproach'' to reduce _ not eliminate _ the subsidies.   Although that was far short of Reagan's proposal, White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was still an improvement fromthe vaguely worded language of the draft communique.   ``The U.S. is happy with the final product,'' Fitzwater said.   A political statement issued Monday praised Reagan for his armsnegotiations with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and urged thesuperpowers to pursue deep cuts in their strategic nuclear arsenals.   Offering Gorbachev an incentive to pursue his programs ofopenness and freedom, the summit leaders held out the prospect ofexpanded trade with the West and said that Soviet reforms would beviewed positively.   Reagan, stressing his free-market philosophy, had argued thatupwards of $200 billion a year is spent around the world each yearto subsidize farm exports. However, Europeans in particular arguedthat it would be unrealistic to eliminate the politically popularsubsidies.   Despite the rebuff on subsidies, Reagan basically got what hewanted from the summit in terms of tougher action against terrorismand illegal drug trafficking.   At the urging of Reagan, the summit statement said the economicproblems of the Phillipines deserve special attention. However,Reagan had to compromise with French President Francois Mitterrandwho insisted that Latin America, Africa and other Pacific nationsalso be mentioned. The two leaders grappled at length over theissue.   In the final communique, the leaders said, ``Since we last met,our economies have kept up the momentum of growth. Employment hascontinued to expand, inflation has been restrained, and progresshas been made toward the correction of major external imbalances.   ``These encouraging developments are cause for optimism but notfor complacency,'' the document said. ``To sustain non-inflationarygrowth will require a commitment to enhanced cooperation. This is akey to credibility and confidence.''   On Third World debt, the leaders accepted a compromise putforward by Canada that permits countries to exercise severaloptions for granting debt relief. They include extending the timeperiod for paying off loans, reducing interest rates or actuallywriting off a portion of the loans.   The United States was willing to extend payment periods but wasopposed to the other two debt relief measures, prompting the needfor the so-called ``menu'' approach.   The leaders endorsed the process of closer economic cooperationinitiated at the Tokyo summit in 1986, saying the system was a keyreason that the world was able to avoid a global economic downturnfollowing the shock from last October's stock market collapse.   ``Developments in the wake of the financial strains last Octoberdemonstrate the effectivness and resilience of the arrangementsthat have emerged,'' the stateent said.   To further the coordination process, summit countries approveduse of a commodity price index to give them an early warning wheninflationary pressures are rising. The index is a compilation ofsome 40 different commodities, including gold.   The communique hailed many of Reagan's free-market ideas,committing the countries to making more progress in deregulatingtheir economies. It also praised the U.S.-Canada free tradeagreement and the efforts of the 12-nation European Community toremove all trade barriers by the year 1992.   The leaders called on the newly industrial countries, SouthKorea Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, to do more to lower theirhuge trade surpluses by opening up their markets and allowing theircurrencies to strengthen in value.   And they said efforts should be increased to protect the world'senvironment, declaring more needs to be done to protect endangeredspecies and to fight threats posed by global climate changes, airand water pollution and acid rain.</TEXT></DOC>
