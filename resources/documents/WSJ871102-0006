Such an agreement would call for the U.S. to cut its budget deficit and for West Germany and Japan to reduce interest rates and further stimulate their own economies while permitting the dollar to drift to a lower level. That would be expected to help the U.S. reduce its trade deficit, attract foreign capital to finance its budget and current-account deficits, and avoid a recession.    &quot;We've got a situation over the last week or so where something like this grand design is needed to produce some stability in currency markets,&quot; Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist at London brokers James Capel andamp; Co., says.    The dollar's short-term fate, analysts say, depends on how quickly and how far the U.S. can trim its budget deficit and how effectively West Germany and Japan act to lower interest rates. But, Mr. Dennis warns, if Bonn and Tokyo move first, &quot;the risk is (that) the pressure will be off the U.S.&quot; to cut its budget by any more than the $23 billion mandated by the Gramm-Rudman Act for fiscal 1988.    Stephen J. Lewis, chief economist for Phillips andamp; Drew, a London-based unit of Union Bank of Switzerland, is skeptical of the new &quot;grand design.&quot;    &quot;I don't think it's workable; I don't think the markets will think it's workable; I don't think there'll be much cooperation in working it,&quot; he says. &quot;It is not, at this moment, the intention of the U.S.'s allies to let the administration off the hook; they want to see budget cuts before they act.&quot;    The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law mandates a $23 billion reduction in the year that began Oct. 1. But Mr. Lewis says the West German Bundesbank and many market participants would prefer to see a cut of around $30 billion to $40 billion.    &quot;It's like a game of poker, and the stakes are getting pretty high,&quot; Mr. Dennis says. &quot;Any agreed cuts in the budget aren't going to appear within a day, a week or several weeks. That's a long time for the dollar to have to survive.&quot;    Since February, the U.S. currency has been supported by the Louvre accord, an agreement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy -- to stabilize exchange rates. Until a week ago, it worked, with the dollar staying mostly in a range of 1.78 to 1.90 West German marks for eight months.    During that period, a combination of rising U.S. interest rates, lower West German and Japanese rates and an estimated $90 billion of market intervention by major central banks supplied the props for a dollar that was fundamentally weakened by the wide U.S. deficits.    Pressure on the currency began building at the end of the summer, when Bonn began raising short-term rates to slow its money-supply growth. Within a few weeks, the U.S. Federal Reserve had to ease monetary policy to support a traumatized stock market after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508.00 points Oct. 19.    &quot;So you had a situation that left the dollar without supports,&quot; Mr. Dennis says. &quot;The U.S. couldn't raise rates, Germany and Japan didn't want to lower rates, and nobody really wanted to intervene.&quot;    Some analysts now expect the West German central bank to ease interest rates by five to 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to prevent a plunge by the dollar. But that probably wouldn't be a big enough move to change the dollar's direction or alter the market's bearish sentiment on the currency. To do that, Mr. Lewis says, would probably require a cut of about half a percentage point in short-term money market rates in West Germany and Japan.    Some analysts contend that Bonn's major motive in lowering rates would be to reduce tensions in the eight-nation European Monetary System of managed exchange rates, rather than to help out the dollar.    In Frankfurt, West Germany's three top economic officials said they oppose major changes in the country's monetary or fiscal policy to support the dollar.    In separate remarks over the weekend, the three officials, Deutsche Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, and Economics Minister Martin Bangemann indicated that they are willing to accept the recent decline of the dollar, but left open the possibility of a slight reduction in money market rates to help the stabilization of the currency.    John Lipsky, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., says that West German motives in supporting the EMS and the dollar with easier monetary policy are converging, because the weaker dollar is the major cause of EMS tension. Some analysts also contend that while West Germany's export industry can cope with the dollar at 1.70 marks, its competitiveness would erode significantly if the U.S. currency fell to 1.65 marks or below.    Mr. Lipsky argues that the timing of the U.S. budget cut &quot;is much less important than how much the U.S. is willing to do.&quot;    The Bundesbank allowed certain rates to slide Friday as the mark climbed to record levels against the French franc and Italian lira. Meanwhile, the French and Belgian central banks intervened to support their currencies against the mark. The Danish krone also came under pressure from the rising mark.    Some traders said that aside from adding liquidity last week, Bonn had also lent funds to other EMS countries to help them in their intervention tactics. Japan also moved to lower short term rates on Friday. But analysts still question how far West Germany and Japan are willing to go before Washington comes up with significant budget cuts.    In late Friday trading in New York, the dollar stood at 1.7290 marks and 138.35 yen, compared with 1.7345 marks and 138.35 yen late Thursday. The British pound rose to $1.7220, a five-year high, from $1.7170 the day before.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 137.50 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for November delivery settled at $468.80 an ounce, up $2.50. Estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces.    &quot;The market feels the administration still wants the dollar to come off a bit,&quot; Charles Minnaar, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said. He said Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, seems to have &quot;been elevated in the cabinet&quot; and that Mr. Sprinkel and some other economists have urged abandoning defense of the dollar as a monetary goal.    Richard Witten, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York, says any new currency accord would have to be &quot;very, very flexible,&quot; with broad parameters for exchange rates, interest rates and deficit figures. The Louvre accord, he says, lacked the flexibility to deal with the continuing wide U.S. trade deficits and the West German and Japanese inability or unwillingness to stimulate their economies.    &quot;These markets are massive; the world has no experience in dealing with truly global investment markets,&quot; Mr. Witten says. Noting that U.S. portfolio managers, Japanese life insurance companies and multinational corporations &quot;make global decisions,&quot; he says, &quot;It's bigger than governments right now.&quot;    Michel Develle, chief economist at Banque Paribas in Paris, says a new currency pact &quot;could provide some peace to currency and stock markets,&quot; but he warns, &quot;This kind of agreement won't be strong enough to last 12 months.&quot;    He worries that by next spring, &quot;The market will say, 'We don't see enough improvement in the (U.S.) trade balance,' and you can have another crisis.&quot;    Mr. Develle says the only &quot;real solution is a recession,&quot; but he and others realize that the U.S. administration and congress will be doing everything possible to avoid one before the 1988 presidential election. Moreover, he contends that the U.S., West Germany and Japan can't all grow at high rates as some policy makers would like.    &quot;It's a paradox,&quot; he says. &quot;You can't at the same time have high rates of economic activity in the U.S. and Japan, because you need Japanese savings in the U.S.; to boost U.S. economic activity, you need a recession in Germany and Japan, because you're starting from a point where you don't have enough savings in the U.S. You need to import capital.&quot;    Because of strains among major industrial nations, Mr. Lewis of Philips andamp; Drew says, the dollar could fall to a record low of 1.65 marks in the next few weeks. He also says the currency will have to decline about 5% a year over the next three years to make up for the expected higher inflation in the U.S., compared with that in West Germany and Japan.    Mr. Witten, however, isn't as pessimistic. &quot;Unless there's a major financial crisis, (the dollar) isn't going to gyrate as it has the last two weeks,&quot; he says.
