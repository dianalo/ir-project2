The deposit is equivalent to 1.2 billion barrels of oil and more than doubles Peru's oil reserves of more than 500 million barrels, the ministry said.    The discovery was made by Shell Exploradora Co. during oil exploration in Ucayali state near its southern border with Cuzco state, the ministry said. Shell Exploradora is an affiliate of Royal Dutch/Shell Group.    A pipeline needed to carry the gas to coastal Lima or to Brazil would take three years to construct, the ministry said.    Peru hasn't developed its natural-gas reserves because of the high cost of building a pipeline from well sites through mountains to industrial and shipping centers on the coast.    The government said contracts to produce the gas would be negotiated with domestic and foreign oil companies.    Shell Exploradora, Occidental Petroleum Corp. of the U.S. and foreign consortium Oxy-Bridas are currently under contract to develop Peru's oil reserves.    Peru produces about 180,000 barrels of oil a day, consuming about 120,000 of that domestically and exporting the rest. </TEXT></DOC>
