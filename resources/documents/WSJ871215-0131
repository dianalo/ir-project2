Large numbers of readers are buying their books and even larger numbers are buying dictionaries, presumably to help themselves become more literate. Two of the five titles on the self-help best-seller list produced by New York's leading local paper are desk-top dictionaries. &quot;Webster's New World Dictionary&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, 1,692 pages, $16.95), the authority relied on by editors at the Journal, has been a best seller 26 times. &quot;Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary&quot; (Merriam-Webster, 1,533 pages, $14.95) has been on the list 118 times, having just sneaked ahead of &quot;Super Marital Sex.&quot;    The lexical passion thrives in this country in a pragmatic way. Where the multivolume &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; looks mostly backward and gives today's lingo only a guarded nod, our dictionaries are for use, proudly up-to-date, welcoming to new words and modes of diction, portable or at least in single volumes. The golden age of the American dictionary ended in 1961 when Merriam-Webster replaced the peerless second edition of its unabridged dictionary with the &quot;Third New International Dictionary.&quot; Webster's Second (W2) simply overwhelms the competition because it has more words and better words -- in other words, words an adult might need to look up.    This is surely the main point of a big dictionary for the general reader. If W3 struck many of us as an ignoble retreat from this ideal -- in favor of slack standards and terms too new to belong in a dictionary -- then &quot;The Random House Dictionary of the English Language&quot; in its first edition (1966, RD1) tried to satisfy both camps, the moldy figs and those who wanted to cast off the fig leaves of lexical modesty. Now we have RD2 (2,500 pages, $79.95). It is bigger (more than 50,000 new entries) and conceptually better. Biographical and geographical entries are alphabetized with the other words. RD2 has an updated four-color 32-page atlas, a history of the English language and, for him or her who wants it, advice on how to avoid sexism in writing. As Bennett Cerf, co-founder of Random House, once put it, &quot;Safari, sogoody.&quot;    But what about the words? You could do far worse and will have trouble doing better without hunting for W2 in the out-of-print market. RD2 has more than 315,000 entries. They include the old (scutage) and the new (junkbond) but not the barbarous (herstory). Almost everyone will find what he is looking for in RD2 most of the time, but it is not hard to find holes and unevenness. Beard fanciers will miss pogonotomy. Under kiwi, the complex entry does not distinguish clearly between the bird and the plant, and gives the scientific name of the plant only in another entry under its other, now rarely used, vernacular name, Chinese gooseberry. The etymology for schmuck is incomplete and misleading; only the obscene Yiddish meaning is given while the High German cognate, an everyday term for jewel, is omitted. George Henry Lewes is identified merely as an English writer and critic, but not, as most people, even nonsexists, think of him, as the lover of George Eliot. These are quibbles, but they are not cheap shots. No dictionary can be truly universal, especially not a single-volume dictionary. But the flaws just mentioned were caught by random page-flipping in a few minutes. It was impossible to survey the text thoroughly, but a spot check revealed that the rare Shakespearean word scammel, from &quot;The Tempest,&quot; is not included, which makes one wonder if other words in Shakespeare's vocabulary are also missing. At the very least, dictionaries should have the bard thoroughly covered.    Still, one is glad for the riches that are offered, and that are now being promoted with a $1 million budget. It was a delight to turn from a newspaper account that mentioned that unimaginably short piece of time, the femtosecond, to find in RD2 not only that femto- is a combining form signifying a quadrillionth, but that it comes from the Danish for 15 (in scientific notation a quadrillionth is 10 to the negative 15th power). How did femto- come into English? I suspect the hand of that very great Dane, physicist Niels Bohr.    Another new word defined in RD2 is foodie. The man who gave this perhaps unnecessary new name for gourmet its widest currency is not himself listed in RD2, but he is working hard to make the next edition. Paul Levy, the Kentucky-born food and wine editor of the Observer (London) produced in 1984 a facetious but factual account of contemporary gastronomic life called &quot;The Official Foodie Handbook.&quot; Mr. Levy has also written a study of British philosopher G.E. Moore. And he has written occasionally for this page.    Now his fellow Americans can see Mr. Levy whole for the first time. And there is a lot of him. In the new collection of his assorted writings called &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; (Harper andamp; Row, 240 pages, $18.95), we find Mr. Levy busy nearly everywhere, from Peking to Paris. He eats dog in Macao and drinks Armagnac in the former home of D'Artagnan. He debunks the mystique of truffle hunting and he tells you everything worth knowing about pastrami down to its post-Ottoman etymology (RD2 is very good on pastrami also). Since it is the policy of this department to present but not to judge books written by our regular contributors, suffice it to say, by way of recommendation, that my first copy of &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; was stolen off my desk. </TEXT></DOC>
