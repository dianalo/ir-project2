The agreement would require the nation to accept standardsalready approved for California, the state with the worst smogpollution problem and the toughest emissions requirements.   The anti-smog requirements would remain in effect nationallyuntil 2003, and could be tightened after that if a federal studyshowed more reductions were necessary, the sources said.   Signing on to the privately negotiated agreement were Reps. JohnD. Dingell, D-Mich., who has represented views of the autoindustry, and Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif. a strong backer ofenvironmental groups.   Waxman's demand for much tougher auto standards, and Dingell'sresistance, has led to a stalemate that played a large role inblocking a new clean air bill for a decade.   The Energy and Commerce Committee members who signed on to theagreement have pledged to honor the pact through the entirelegislative process, said the sources, who spoke only on conditionthey not be named. Dingell is chairman of the full committee, andWaxman heads the environment subcommittee that currently isconsidering amendments to President Bush's clean air bill.   The agreement will be written as an amendment to the autopollution section of Bush's legislation, a section recently amendedin subcommittee to eliminate averaging of pollution emissions andto require on-board canisters to capture gasoline vapors.   The agreement would require a study before 2003 by theEnvironmental Protection Agency and congressional Office ofTechnology Assessment, to determine if more emissions reductionswould be needed.   The EPA administrator could decide to tighten the standards as aresult of the study or leave them alone. If he does nothing,standards already proposed by Waxman would automatically becomeeffective.   The agreement also would include controls on toxic chemicalscoming from automobiles, the sources said.   California now requires nitrogen oxide emissions be limited to0.4 grams per mile up to 50,000 miles. Beginning 1995, California'shydrocarbon limits _ to be written into federal law _ will be 0.25grams per mile for 50,000 miles and 0.31 grams between 50,000 and100,000 miles.   The carbon monoxide standard is 3.4 grams for 50,000 miles and4.2 grams between 50,000 and 100,000 miles.   Current federal standards outside California are 0.41 grams permile for hydrocarbons, 1 gram for nitrogen oxides and 3.4 grams forcarbon monoxide.   ``With Waxman and Dingell agreeing, I don't see who can keep itout of the law,'' one source said of the new standards.   Chief Senate clean air sponsors already have proposed toughemissions requirements, but the amendment process has not yetstarted in that chamber.   Those who negotiated the agreement, besides Dingell and Waxman,include Rep. Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y., Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.,Terry Bruce, D-Ill, Ralph M. Hall, D-Texas, Mike Synar, D-Okla. andThomas Tauke, R-Iowa.</TEXT></DOC>
