Well, color's worth a million numbers,&quot; he said.andP;  Color has become atool that is used to differentiate similar products by producing lively,attractive results that grab the attention of clients and consumers.andM;Color is geared toward a market in which competition is fierce, Howe noted.andO;He cited newspapers as an example of a market where visual appeal is key andwhere color can be essential in distinguishing one competitor from another.andM;While color scanners are available to meet the needs of users seeking thistype of competitive edge, the question remains whether consumers be willingto pay the price.andM;Prices now range from $2,595 for Microtek Lab Inc.'s combinationcolor/gray-scale scanner to $3,995 for Sharp Electronics Corp.'s JX-300 colorscanner, $4,995 for Howtek's ScanMaster II color scanner, and $6,995 forSharp's more sophisticated JX-450 color scanner.andP;  While it seems apparentthat prices will eventually drop even lower than their present levels, anycomparable drop in the machines' quality could result in a split market forcolor scanners.andM;Robins predicted that two separate groups of scanners will emerge if thetechnology diverges along with prices.andP;  One group will be mass-produced forthe average business user, he said, while a second, more customized type ofscanner will serve the high-end market.andP;  For makers of general-purposescanners, &quot;it's going to get real cutthroat,&quot; he said.andM;Another concern of vendors and users alike is the availability of colorscanner software.andM;&quot;There's very little software that can handle the simplest of color,&quot; saidJohn Kozlowski, director of marketing for Microtek, a manufacturer of desktopscanners, in Torrance, Calif.andP;  &quot;It's very limited on the PC platform.&quot;andM;While software for Macintosh-based color scanners was introduced a year ago,the PC side is lagging behind.andP;  &quot;It'll take a while for the PC side to catchup,&quot; said Kozlowski.andM;According to Bill Hood, director of VGA product development for WesternImaging Inc., a manufacturer of high-resolution image/graphics systems, inMountain View, Calif., &quot;It's typical of the scanner industry not really togive much thought to the software after they've developed the hardware.andP;  Theyleave it to third parties to develop the software.&quot; This can become veryfrustrating for end users, who may find they cannot buy both hardware andsoftware from a single vendor.andM;Todd Kap, manager of international special projects at WordPerfect Corp., inOrem, Utah, did not receive scanning software with the Sharp JX-300, as hehad expected.andP;  Instead, he had to purchase ColorLab I/P, from ComputerPresentations Inc., of Cincinnati, to take advantage of the colorcapabilities of his scanner.andM;Such software difficulties have some vendors concerned about the future forcolor scanners.andP;  Kozlowski cautioned, &quot;The future for color scanning and thePC platform is just that, the future.&quot;andM;Howtek's Marino is more hopeful.andP;  &quot;The first color application on the Macjust happened last year,&quot; he said.andP;  A dramatic growth in accompanyinghardware, software and third-party software resulted from the introduction ofthe Mac-based color scanner, and makers of PC scanners hope that history willrepeat itself in their market.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
