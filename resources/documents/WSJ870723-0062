Sen. Robert Kasten (R., Wis.) and other members of Congress claimed at least a partial victory in their efforts to give the U.S. group headed by Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co. a fair chance to supply an optical-disk system for the Commerce Department's Patent and Trademark Office.    The patent office will buy only a $908,000 portion of the contract and defer purchasing the rest until it completes a one-year evaluation. The agency will then either buy the rest of the equipment from Sony or reopen the bidding, a spokesman said.    The department earlier gave Sony the highest scores among four separate bidders but gave in to strong pressure from the Wisconsin and California congressional delegations. A Minnesota Mining optical-disk plant is located in Menomonie, Wis., and two other firms in the group are based in Sunnyvale, Calif.    Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, however, reasserted the administration's policy of keeping its procurement market open to qualified foreign bidders as an incentive for other countries to open their markets to U.S. firms. &quot;World-wide, we stand to win substantially more than we lose with open procurement,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
