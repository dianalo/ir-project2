Multibillion-dollar orders have been rolling in over the pastfew years, and even the industry midgets, such as Fokker BV of theNetherlands and British Aerospace PLC, have years of work booked.   ``Each succeeding major order is extending by a few weeks thetime during which the companies or the industry will be at peakproduction over the next several years,'' Nisbet said.   On Tuesday, GPA Group Ltd. announced a $17 billion order for 308airliners _ 121 firm orders and options on an additional 187 jets _from Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Europe's Airbus Industrie.   The order from the Shannon, Ireland, aircraft-leasing concern isthe largest civilian aircraft order ever, topping Delta Air Lines'$10.5 billion order for up to 225 Boeing and McDonnell Douglasaircraft last September.   GPA's order reflects the growing importance of aircraft leasingcompanies, which account for about one-fifth of all aircraftorders. It also underscores the airlines' concern about replacingtheir aging fleets.   Boeing's $9.4 billion share of the order is for 92 737 models,50 757s and 40 767s, with deliveries over the next seven years.   At Boeing's rate of production, the orders represent about ahalf-year's work. The order fills production slots into themid-1990s, said Boeing spokesman T. Craig Martin, and while itprovides security for the work force, it won't require newemployees.   Even before the order, he said, Boeing had a backlog of morethan 1,100 aircraft, and the industry giant is predicting allbuilders will deliver 8,400 new airplanes by 2005 to keep up withdemand.   ``So while an order like this looks huge, it's really not thatbig a percentage of total deliveries,'' Martin said.   Last year was a record one for Boeing, which received 636 orderstotaling $29 billion. So far this year, 301 orders with a value of$19.1 billion are on the books of the Seattle company.   Despite the flood of orders, industry analyst Paul Turk ofAvmark Inc. in Arlington, Va., said that while the industry is inthe clouds it could be brought back to earth in a rush if the worldeconomy sputters.   He said Avmark believes Boeing's projections for 8,400 newairplanes in the next 16 years _ which would more than replace theexisting fleet of some 7,800 planes _ is overly optimistic.   ``But,'' he added, ``the market is very good and it should bevery good for a while to come.''   Nisbet said he couldn't argue with Boeing's figures. Theair-carrier industry, from passengers booking flights tomanufacturers and subcontractors, has been flourishing like no onehad predicted, he said.   The airplane-building business has been growing at anaccelerated rate for several years, Nisbet said, and hit 8 percentlast year.   ``If you consider 4 percent growth a year as normal ... yourdemand for (new) aircraft should be around 300 to 350 a year,'' hesaid.   Last year, he said, there were 512 new deliveries across theindustry, with Boeing providing 289 of those. By 1991, heestimated, 750 could be delivered.   Even with an expected leveling off of air travel in the early1990s, he said, demand for airplanes should remain strong becausereplacement aircraft are needed.   ``For the first time (in industry history) we are in the midstof a replacement cycle, as well as a growth cycle that is verystrong,'' he said.   Besides Boeing's share of the GPA order, McDonnell Douglas Corp.received a $3.1 billion order for 64 MD-80 twin-jets and 8 MD-11three-jet models, while Airbus Industrie won a $4.3 billion orderfor 30 A320s, 10 A330s, and two A340s. In addition, GPA tookoptions on an additional 10 A330s and two A340s.</TEXT></DOC>
