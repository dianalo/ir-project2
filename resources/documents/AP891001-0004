The findings came in the study of hundreds of gay and bisexualmen that the Health Department has been conducting since the earlydays of the AIDS epidemic.   City Health Director Dr. David Werdegar acknowledged thefindings were based on interviews with the subjects rather thanclinical evidence but said researchers were ``absolutely sure'' thetwo gay men had contracted the human immunodeficincy virus throughoral sex.   ``We believe we got very accurate information,'' said Werdegar,who added that the subjects trusted the Health Departmentresearchers and had worked with them over a long period.   The research team headed by Rutherford and Dr. Alan Lifson ispreparing to submit the results to either the Journal of theAmerican Medicl Association or the New England Journal of Medicine,Werdegar said.   Both men who tested positive for the HIV virus reported havingperformed oral sex on numerous partners, Rutherford said.   Other clinicians have reported a few other examples of peoplebecoming infected through oral sex, but the Health Department'sfindings were the first time such a transmission had beendocumented in a major study, Rutherford said.   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Kopp warned three years agothat oral sex might be a transmission path for the AIDS virus, butsome health authorities and parts of the gay community had startedto believe otherwise. The city's gay and lesbian press in recentmonths has debated the issue, and some private sex clubs allow thepractice.   ``There have been a lot of questions about oral sex. (But) thisindicates it definitely is a risk,'' Werdegar said of the findings.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus thatdamages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible toinfections and cancer.   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles orsyringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,and from pregnant women to their offspring.   The scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiencyvirus, or HIV.   As of July 31, the federal Centers for Disease Control inAtlanta had recorded a cumulative total of 102,621 cases of AIDS inthe United States, with 59,391 deaths.</TEXT></DOC>
