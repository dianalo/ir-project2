Ford, Women's EducationalEquity Act Program, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW. (Room 2053, FOB-6), Washington,DC 20202-6439. (202) 732-4351.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The purpose of the Women's EducationalEquity Act (WEEA) Program is to: (1) Provide equity for women_includinggirls_at all levels of education, (2) financially assist educational agenciesand institutions in meeting all requirements of Title IX of the EducationAmendments of 1972 (relating to nondiscrimination on the basis of sex infederally assisted educational programs), and (3) promote educational equityfor women who suffer multiple discrimination, bias or stereotyping basedon sex and race, ethnic origin, disability, or age. Funds are providedthrough grants and contracts for projects of national, statewide, or generalsignificance (referred to in this preamble as projects of general significance)that could be disseminated widely and replicated in a variety of settings.Projects of general significance include challenge grants, not to exceed$40,000 each, for projects to develop new dissemination and replicationstrategies and innovative approaches to achieving the purposes of the WEEA.Funds may also be provided for projects of local significance, if the appropriationfor the WEEA Program exceeds a statutorily specified amount. In that case,the Secretary has the option of using the excess funds for projects ofgeneral significance, projects of local significance, or both.The WEEA Program has been reauthorized and amended by the Augustus F. Hawkins-RobertT. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988_Pub.L. 100-297. The amendments lower to $4.5 million the appropriation thresholdfor funding projects of local significance and include, in selecting recipientsfor funding, a priority for applications from applicants that have notbeen previously funded.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Changes in These Proposed Regulations</ITAG>andbullet; The proposed regulations would redesignate and revise the exitingregulations and divide them into three separate parts of Title 34 of theCode of Federal Regulations (CFR). General requirements applicable bothto projects of general significance and to projects of local significancewould be contained in Part 245. Part 246 would contain additional provisionsapplicable only to projects of general significance, and Part 247 wouldcontain additional provisions applicable only to projects of local significance.andbullet; The proposed regulations implement new requirements of the Hawkins-StaffordAmendments of 1988_Pub. L. 100-297.andbullet; The proposed regulations would delete unnecessary or unduly burdensomerequirements from the current regulations, clarify the provisions of theregulations, and remove duplicative requirements_such as those that duplicateEDGAR.andbullet; The proposed regulations would revise priorities the Secretarymay establish for funding in any given year.<ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Changes in These Proposed Regulations</ITAG>The specific changes incorporated into this notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) include the following:andbullet; The proposed regulations would eliminate provisions detailingthe amounts of stipends. These amounts are not specified in the Act. Theirelimination would allow applicants more flexibility in proposing ratesfor stipends that the Secretary would then examine on a case-by-case basisunder provisions of EDGAR.andbullet; The proposed regulations would delete the ranking process usedby the Secretary in evaluating applications. The process is already coveredby EDGAR (34 CFR 75.217(c)).andbullet; The proposed regulations revise the additional factors in andSection;745.28(b) of the current regulations that are used in making award decisions.The proposed regulations include only those factors that the statute requiresbe considered in selecting applications for funding_i.e., geographic distributionand special consideration for applications from applicants that have notpreviously received assistance under this program.andbullet; The proposed regulations make the cost principles referenced in34 CFR 74.174 (relating to nonprofit organizations) applicable to awardsto individuals, except that individuals may not use an indirect cost rateto charge overhead. andbullet; The proposed regulations would replace the priorities in andSection;andSection;745.24through 745.27 of the current regulations regarding projects of generalsignificance with priorities for projects that address several issues andperceived needs currently affecting women's achievement of educationalequity. Each year the Secretary could specify one or more of the followingas priorities for projects of general significance: <ITAG tagnum="15">_Projects to develop and test model programs and materials concerningTitle IX compliance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Projects to increase the interest and participation of women in instructionalcourses in mathematics, science, and computer science. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Projects to reduce the rate at which women drop out of educationalinstitutions and to encourage women to resume their education. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Projects to expand guidance and counseling programs to enable womento become more aware of and knowledgeable about careers in which womenhave not significantly participated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Projects to enhance opportunities for educational achievement byeconomically disadvantaged women. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Projects to enhance opportunities for women who suffer multiple discriminationbased on sex and race, ethnic origin, age, or disability. </ITAG>andbullet; The proposed regulations incorporate the new statutory requirementthat the Secretary, in selecting award recipients, give special considerationto applications from applicants that have not previously received WEEAfunds. Ten additional points would be awarded to these applications. andbullet; Although the criteria the Secretary uses to evaluate applicationsfor projects of general significance would remain essentially the sameas in the current regulations, the proposed regulations make the followingchanges: <ITAG tagnum="15">_The criterion for plan of operation would emphasize the soundnessof the management plan of a proposed project. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_In the criterion under which the Secretary determines the qualityof the director and staff of a proposed project, the Secretary would delete,as unnecessary, many of the specific sub-factors in the current regulations.</ITAG>andbullet; The proposed regulations add provisions for projects of localsignificance. Proposed new Part 247, together with the general provisionsin proposed Part 245, would contain those regulatory provisions the Secretaryregards as necessary to govern these types of projects, including the prioritiesfrom which the Secretary may select projects of local significance andthe criteria used to evaluate applications for these projects. Also includedwould be a provision implementing the statutory requirement that in anyyear funds become available for projects of local significance, the Secretaryallocates at least 75 percent of the funds to LEAs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Significant Aspects of These Proposed Regulations </ITAG>In proposing these regulations, the Secretary wishes to draw the attentionof readers to several matters: <T3>Projects of Local Significance.</T3> The Act does not automaticallyauthorize awards each year for projects of local significance. Rather,the Act specifies that the Secretary may make these types of awards ifthe appropriation for the overall program in any given year exceeds $4.5million. Even if that threshold amount is met, the Secretary has the discretionunder the law to determine how much, if any, of an appropriation above$4.5 million will be awarded for projects of local significance. <T3>Provisions of the Statute.</T3> The Secretary does not find it necessaryto repeat in these proposed regulations every provision of the statuteauthorizing the program. Nonetheless, statutory requirements not repeatedare in effect, and the Secretary urges users of the regulations to familiarizethemselves with all applicable requirements. <T3>Girls, Women, and Adult Women.</T3> Unless the Act specifies that arequirement or activity applies only to ``adult women'' (defined in proposedandSection;245.11(b)(5)(ii)), the term ``women'' in these proposed regulationsis intended to include girls. <T3>Open Meeting Requirement.</T3> The proposed regulations require thata local educational agency hold an open meeting regarding the contentsof its application, and certify in its application that the meeting washeld. These requirements were previously contained in the Education DepartmentGeneral Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) and added to the WEEA regulationsin 1987 through a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(<T3>See</T3> 52 FR 27805). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meetthe criteria for major regulations established in the Executive Order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12606 </ITAG>These regulations will have a positive impact on the family and are consistentwith the requirements of Executive Order 12606_The Family. These regulationsstrengthen the authority and participation of parents in the educationof their children. For example, the regulations specifically require thata local educational agency hold an open meeting regarding the contentsof its application to give parents and the public in general an opportunityto testify or otherwise comment on the contents. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification </ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations will not have significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This programprovides assistance to local educational agencies, State agencies, publicor nonprofit agencies, organization, or institutions, and individuals.These proposed regulations describe the program and establish minimal applicationrequirements. They will not have a significant economic impact on smallentities participating in the program. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act 1980 </ITAG>Sections 246.31 through 246.36 and 247.31 through 247.37 contain informationcollection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of this section tothe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. <ITAG tagnum="20">(44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) </ITAG>Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the informationcollection requirements should direct them to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,DC 20503; Attention: James F.

The objective of the Executive Orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance.In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Invitation To Comment</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regardingthese proposed regulations.All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will beavailable for public inspection, during and after the comment period, inRoom 2053, FOB-6, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between thehours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week exceptFederal holidays.To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements ofExecutive Order 12291 and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and theiroverall requirement of reducing regulatory burden, the Secretary invitescomment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any regulatoryburdens found in these proposed regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact</ITAG>The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulationsin this document would require transmission of information that is beinggathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the UnitedStates.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Parts 245, 246, and 247</ITAG>Education, Government contracts, Grant programs_education, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements, Sex discrimination.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
