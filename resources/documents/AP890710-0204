Strong consumption and investment are to blame. Recent politicalstability has unleashed long pent-up demand.   To cool the economy, the government in April instituted 11financial measures which raised interest rates _ now at nearly 15percent _ reduced banks' liquidity, and restricted the availabilityof credit, particularly in the booming car sales market.   Although some measures were widely regarded as necessary, theywere attacked as late and misdirected. They have underscored thegovernment's tendency to intervene while simultaneously championingfree-market policies.   ``Again, it is the private sector that is suffering,'' said LuisCampos e Cunha, an economics professor at Lisbon's New University.``They should be thinking of squeezing public expenditure.''   Foreign investors complain of having to cope with the frequentpolicy changes and voluminous red tape. Taxes are complex and laborlaws restrictive. There are periodic public sector strikes.   Nonetheless, foreign investors, seeking a foothold in the CommonMarket ahead of 1992 and attracted by Portugal's low wages, invested$496 million in the year ended October, up significantly from $166million in 1986.   Said Nicholas Racich, administrator of Manufacturers HanoverTrust Co.'s Portuguese operations, ``You have to keep pluggingaway.''   But the millions of dollars of EC financial aid that have flowedinto Portugal has proved a mixed blessing. Although it has enabledmuch-needed improvements to transport and communications to begin,EC demands for Portuguese matching funds have worsened the budgetdeficit.   The government is implementing far-reaching economic reforms,including restructuring the capital markets.   The third-tier Lisbon and Oporto stock exchanges, not yet fullyrecovered from the stock market crash, are being modernized andcombined into a national bourse. In late April, the governmentlaunched an ambitious privatization program with the sale of a 49percent stake in Unicer, the state-owned brewer.   ``We want to create the confidence, confidence on various levels,not just in the market but also in the financial institutions,''said Rui Ambrosio Tribolet, the Lisbon Stock Exchange's generalsecretary.   But another problem is that Portugal's progress is expected towiden social divisions.   Said Cavalheira Antunes: ``The idea of social solidarity isregressing and the idea of everyone for himself is coming out ontop.''   Portugal lags behind its neighbors on many counts.   At some $3,700, its per capita GDP is Europe's lowest. It has theworst literacy rate and one of the highest infant mortality rates.   Portugal imports 80 percent of its energy and, surprisingly, halfits food, even though one-fifth of the population works inagriculture.   The country is extremely dependent on tourism. Each year,Portugal's population more than doubles as tourists flock in, mostlyto the southern Algarve coast.   Other big industries tend to be traditional: textiles, footwear,cork, forestry products, fishing, wine, and ceramics. Shipbuildingand repair, and construction also are important.   The experts say 1992 poses two possible scenarios.   If it's lucky and smart, Portugal could become Europe'sCalifornia by concentrating on exotic produce, high technology,light manufacturing and tourism.   If it isn't, foreigners might buy up Portugal's choice assets,leaving it flooded with imports and producing the low-tech,low-profit goods.   The Portuguese, who are mostly Catholic, conservative and familyminded, have a reputation for being resilient in adversity andflexible in the face of change.   In particular, Portugal prides itself on successfully absorbingsome 700,000 Portuguese ``retornados'' and African immigrants whofled to the country in the mid-1970s after Portugal gave up itsAfrican colonies of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau.   Optimistic about the outlook is the industry confederation'sLacerda, who said: ``I think we are not going to miss theopportunity of 1992.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 23</NOTE></DOC>
