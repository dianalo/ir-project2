Two issues remain to be worked out in meetings next month, butotherwise the union won most of its demands, the group said in astatement.   Mobil spokesman Mike Morgan in New York said the company wouldnot comment on any possible accord.   Mobil announced on April 28 that it was withdrawing from theracially divided nation and selling holdings once valued at $400million to General Mining Union Corp. Ltd., a South Africanconglomerate, for more than $155 million in cash and $10 millionthat was expected to be the operation's 1989 profit.   The company, which blamed U.S. foreign policy for forcing thepullout, said it would record a net book loss of $140 million on thesale after adjustments for taxes and accounting.   The chemical workers' union threatened to strike, accusing Mobilof lying about its intentions to leave and demanding a series ofconcessions. The union represents 1,200 of Mobil's 1,500 blackworkers.   Tuesday's agreement honors labor contracts and provides jobsecurity with the new owner as well as details of the disinvestment,the union said.   The ``one vital piece of information'' still to be provided, theunion said, was whether Mobil would continue to supply crude oil toSouth Africa after Gencor's subsidiary, Trek, takes over Mobil'sassets June 30.   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said in April that Mobil would notexport crude or products to South Africa.   The union said this and details of a trust fund would benegotiated with a senior U.S. representative from Mobil next month.   ``The union regards the progress made so far as a major advancein its campaign for a fair disinvestment procedure. There is still aconsiderable way to go but within the constraints of Mobil's failureto give notice ... progress has been made,'' the union statementsaid.   Mobil had operated in South Africa for 90 years and was thelargest U.S. company doing business there, with almost 2,800employees.   Its decision to withdraw followed months of denials that it wouldfollow Exxon Corp., who left in 1986, and about 170 other Americancompanies in bowing to pressure to disinvest in South Africa becauseof the country's apartheid racial policy.   Some major oil exporters claim to observe an embargo on doingbusiness in South Africa, but the absence of any petroleum shortageshas raised questions about whether and how their products arefunneled into the country.   Militant black unions joined other anti-apartheid groups indemanding sanctions and disinvestment by foreign companies duringwidespread political unrest in 1985 and 1986, but since then havecooled their public rhetoric on the subject. Critics of the unionposition say the pullouts by major firms hurt black workers as wellas hardening the attitudes of whites.   Mobil said earlier that all contract and equal employmentpolicies would remain in effect under the new owners and the companywould continue until at least 1994 to fund a foundation thatsupports various social programs in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
