(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A socialite dubbed the ``fugitivetemptress,'' who spent six years on the run to avoid trial oncharges she and her lover had her husband murdered, has beencaptured in Washington state, authorities said Friday.   Mary Naomi Cloud, 45, was picked up by the Benton County, Wash.,sheriff's department late Thursday, authorities said. She had beenmissing since 1982.   ``I waited a long time for this,'' said Don Meadows, aninvestigator with the Mercer County prosecutor's office. Meadows, aformer state trooper, traveled to Washington with state police Sgt.Charles Blizzard for the arrest.   Mrs. Cloud was charged with first-degree murder of her husband,David, who was shot in the yard of their home as the couplereturned from a dinner party on Jan. 26, 1980. Cloud, 56, was vicepresident of Carter Machinery Co.   Authorities allege Mrs. Cloud lured her lover, John ElmerCorprew Jr. of Roanoke, Va., into the plot to kill her husband, andthat Corprew in turn paid George Guthrie II of Roanoke $2,500 to bethe triggerman.   Corprew testified that Mrs. Cloud ``was like a spider and I wascaught in her web. I couldn't get out.''   Corprew was sentenced to one to five years in prison forvoluntary manslaughter as part of a plea bargain and was releasedafter eight months. Guthrie was convicted of first-degree murder in1984 and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was overturnedby the state Supreme Court, but he was convicted a second time andagain sentenced to life.   After she was indicted, Mrs. Cloud moved to Huntington, whereshe went to work selling cars and became romantically involved witha former employee of her father's, Bernie D. Stanley, authoritiessaid. She and Stanley fled just before her trial was to begin onMay 17, 1982, officials said.   Mrs. Cloud had put up as her bond a $50,000 building she ownedin Princeton, but prosecutors said she sold the building beforeskipping town.   Mrs. Cloud contended her husband was murdered by a masked manwho emerged from the darkness. She said the assailant demandedmoney from her husband, then fired a single shotgun blast into hisface.   Mercer County Prosecutor David Knight said he became suspiciousof her story, questioning why the masked man hadn't burgled theirhouse while they were away. He also questioned why Mrs. Cloud hadbeen spared.   Meadows said West Virginia authorities received a tip about Mrs.Cloud's whereabouts earlier this week and traveled to Kennewick onThursday. He said they showed neighbors pictures from Mrs. Cloud'swanted poster and staked out her house once they determined the tipwas accurate.   Meadows said no one was home when they arrived at Mrs. Cloud'shome about 7:30 p.m. He said Stanley arrived shortly after 8 p.m.,and Mrs. Cloud showed up about 11:20 p.m. Stanley faces no chargesand was not arrested, Meadows said.</TEXT></DOC>
