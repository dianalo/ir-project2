Bethlehem will negotiate a purchase and sale agreement for the idle mill, the company said. The company, based in Bethlehem, Pa., said it is unable to predict how long it will take to complete the purchase.    The Monessen mill will supplement Bethlehem's current rail-making facilities, the company said. Blooms, the semi-finished steel shapes that the mill rolls into railroad rails, can be supplied by other Bethlehem steel plants, the company said.    Wheeling-Pittsburgh is attempting a reorganization under protection of Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. </TEXT></DOC>
