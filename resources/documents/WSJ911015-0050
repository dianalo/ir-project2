It's gotten even more so with a proliferation ofcustom-blended policies that can be either a real benefit ora booby trap for buyers.</LP><TEXT>   The mix-and-match policies combine traditional &quot;wholelife&quot; insurance with one or two other varieties of lifecoverage. Like whole life, the blends provide a payment atdeath and a tax-advantaged savings component. But, comparedwith plain whole-life policies, they offer faster savingsgrowth or lower premiums.   The blends can be a boon to budget-conscious insuranceshoppers who are worried about insurer safety and want todeal only with the biggest, highest rated companies. Glenn S.Daily, a New York insurance adviser, says that, in a sense,&quot;you have access to the triple-A companies on a discountbasis.&quot;   Blends available from companies such as PrudentialInsurance Co. of America and Guardian Life Insurance Co. ofAmerica have significantly lower sales commissions than thoseinsurers' regular whole-life policies. As a result, for thesame premium, &quot;you are going to get more value in the policyor you are going to pay premiums for fewer years,&quot; says PeterC. Katt, a West Bloomfield, Mich., insurance adviser.   Alternatively, coverages can be mixed and matched to trimthe annual premium. But bargain hunters shouldn't gooverboard. &quot;There is potential to abuse those tools,&quot; bytaking the premium too low, warns Rick K. Nelson, aNorthbrook, Ill., agent who has been active in blendeddesign. &quot;The risk is that the premium will either be payablefor many, many years longer than you thought or -- what isworse -- that the premium could triple or quadruple in futureyears.&quot;   The workings of any mix-and-match policy depend on theproportions of the parts -- whole life, term insurance andthe less-known &quot;paid-up additions.&quot;   Paid-up additions are the key to creating a souped-upalternative to a company's regular whole-life coverage. Theadditions are essentially little whole-life policies on whichall the premiums are prepaid with one lump sum. A common useof paid-up additions is to gradually increase the deathbenefit of a whole-life policy by having the policy's annualdividends buy some paid-up coverage.   The big reason for using paid-up additions in a blend isthat sales commissions paid to agents are usually much lowerthan on regular whole life. That means more of each premiumdollar flows into the policy's &quot;cash value&quot; or savingscomponent.   Blends incorporating paid-up additions have significantcash values beginning in the first year -- something thatisn't seen with full-commission whole life. That's importantbecause the cash value is the amount holders can tap throughpolicy loans or walk away with if they drop the coverage. Theaccelerated cash value growth of such blends makes itpossible to fully pay for coverage in fewer years.   On the negative side, though, the death benefit providedby these blends may rise more slowly than the death benefitof comparable whole-life policies.   Term insurance is the key to creating a blend with apremium way below that of whole life. Because term providesonly a death benefit and no savings component, the initialpremium is much lower than that for a whole-life policy withthe same death benefit.   But a blend that is heavy on term can also be much morerisky than whole life -- possibly without the buyerrecognizing it. That's largely because of the varying waysthat policyholders are charged for different types of lifeinsurance.   When people buy term insurance directly, they usuallyunderstand that the premiums will rise each year and becomeexpensive at later ages. Some people prefer to buy whole lifebecause of its guarantees: As long as the holder keeps payingthe specified premium, the coverage will continue and thepremium won't rise.   Blended policies are designed to look like whole life,with premiums that remain the same. But those premiums aretypically not guaranteed. In fact, steep premium increasesare quite possible on blends that are heavily tilted towardterm. If interest rates fall or term charges rise, &quot;theproduct can crash on you&quot; and suddenly require much largerpremium payments, says John Wilkinson, vice president forinsurance marketing at Cigna Corp.'s Connecticut General LifeInsurance Co. unit.   The reason is that there is a balancing act going oninside the blended policies. If all goes as planned, thegrowth of the whole-life component pays the term premiums andgradually replaces the term with whole life. But the policycan come up short on cash -- requiring a much higher premiumor simply many more payments -- if term charges rise or iflower interest rates slow cash-value growth.   Some insurance buyers may want to take that risk inexchange for lower premiums. But &quot;it's dangerous if theconsumer doesn't understand what is going on,&quot; says SamRadin, president of National Madison Group Inc., New Yorkinsurance agents and advisers.   Consider some options for a hypothetical man looking tobuy $500,000 in coverage from Prudential. At current policyterms, it would take nine annual payments of $9,143 to have aregular whole-life policy fully paid for, according tonumbers prepared by Mr. Radin.   This man could cut his projected payment period to sevenyears with a three-way blend. Or he could pay a much lower$5,378 for 14 years with a blend that is half whole life andhalf term.   But look at what would happen to that low-premium policyin a worst-case scenario involving a two-percentage-pointdrop in the policy's earning rate: The number of paymentsrequired would balloon to 25 years. The impact of a rate dropwould be even more severe in a more aggressive mix of 75% ormore term insurance.   Consumers who want a high-term mix should consider payingthe somewhat higher premiums than would be required atinterest rates one or two percentage points below today'slevels, suggests Ted S. Bernstein, president of AssuredEnterprises Ltd., Chicago insurance advisers. That builds inan extra cushion of cash that makes a shortfall less likely.   Alternatively, to get a three-way mix rather than purewhole life, buyers might ask their agent for a policy thathas a first-year cash value equal to at least half thepremium paid in. Don't expect an agent to be thrilled,though, by the potential reduction in commission.   Indeed, the use of blended designs to vary commissionlevels raises some thorny issues for insurance agents andcompanies. To wit: Is it proper for an agent to propose alow-commission blend to a prospect who is clearly shoppingaround but not to others who are more trusting?   Alan Press, a Guardian agent, says some people at Guardiangrumbled when he wrote about these ethical issues in a recentissue of &quot;Probe,&quot; an industry newsletter he partly owns.   &quot;These are things they don't want talked about. I thinkthey are a little bit embarrassed by it,&quot; Mr. Press says.&quot;They would like to think . . . everybody gets the same deal.But everybody doesn't get the same deal.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
