However, section 3(i)(3) provides that an indivdualwho has less than 30 years of post-1936 service may have his service priorto 1937 counted so as to be credited with 30 years of service if he wasactually working for a railroad employer on Augsut 29, 1935, or was inan employment relation with such an employer on that date. Service by anindividual to a local lodge or division of a railway labor organizationis creditable under the Act only if preceded by actual service or an employmentrelation to a railroad on or after August 29, 1935 (see Part 203 of thischapter). Present Part 204 defines employment relation for purposes ofcrediting prior service and for establishing that service to a local lodgeor division of a railway labor organization is creditable under the Act.These provisions are extremely detailed. The Board proposes to remove unnecessarydetail in these provisions and, thus, Part 204 will become clearer andeasier to use. An employment relation is also necessary for crediting pay for time lostunder andSection; 211.3 of the regulations and for crediting deemed serviceunder andSection; 210.3 of the regulations. Consequently, the Board proposesto add definitions of employment relation for those situations. The Board has determined that this is not a major rule for purposes ofExecutive Order 12291. Therefore no regulatory impact analysis is requiredby the Regulatory Flexbility Act (5 U.S.C. 60-611). In addition, no requirementfor the collection of information within the meaning of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 are imposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 204 </ITAG>Railroad employees. For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 20, Chapter II of the Codeof Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended by revising Part 204 asfollows: <ITAG tagnum="52">Part 204_EMPLOYMENT RELATION </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">204.1 Introduction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">204.2 Employment relation_determination by the Board. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">204.3 Employment relation_general rules. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">204.4 Conditions which preclude an employment relation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">204.5 Employment relation_deemed service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">204.6 Employment relation_pay for time lost. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>45 U.S.C. 231f. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 204.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Introduction. </ITAG>In order for an individual to receive credit under the Railroad RetirementAct (Act) for railroad service prior to 1937, he or she must establishthat he or she was actively working for an employer under the Act on August29, 1935, or was in an employment relation to an employer on that date.In addition, in order for an individual to have his or her service to alocal lodge or division of a railway labor organization considered as creditableservice under the Act, he or she must establish that he or she was workingfor a railroad or in an employment relation to a railroad on or after August29, 1935, and that such employment or employment relation preceded hisor her service to the local lodge or division.
