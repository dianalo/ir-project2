But when the war with Iraq broke out in September 1980, Iran'sarmed forces were the best-equipped in the oil-rich Persian Gulfregion.   Its air force, for instance, had 77 U.S.-built F-14 Tomcats, theonly military force outside the U.S. Navy to have the advancedinterceptors.   U.S. officials said crewmen aboard the guided missile cruiserVincennes believed they were being attacked Sunday by an IranianF-14 when they downed an Iranian passenger jetliner in the Straitof Hormuz. Iran said all 290 people aboard the Iran Air jetlinerwere killed.   At the outset of the Iran-Iraq war, Iran also had 190 F-4Phantoms, 166 F-5 Tigers and 205 U.S.-built helicopter gunships.They were purchased by pro-Western Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, whowas ousted in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.   Now, after nearly eight years of war and a chronic lack of spareparts, military analysts estimate Iran has 60 to 80 F-4s and F-5sand less than 10 operational F-14s.   By comparison, Iraq has more than 500 combat aircraft suppliedby the Soviet Union and France, along with advanced missiles andlaser-guided bombs.   However, reliable sources have reported the Iranians haverecently obtained some spares for the F-14 and avionics for theirF-5s. It is not clear to what extent this has helped their forces.   Hard-pressed to get its hands on spares for its U.S.-builtweapons, the Iranians have in recent years turned to China andNorth Korea for hardware.   Despite Beijing's denials that it supplies Iran with weapons,U.S. military officials say China is now Tehran's main armssupplier, usually through North Korea.   But the Iranians are outgunned on the ground by Iraq and by theU.S. Navy in the gulf.   In the two major naval clashes in the gulf, April 18 and Sunday,the Iranians have lost eight craft sunk or damaged.   But despite the Americans' vastly superior firepower, theIranians are still considered a threat at sea.   They have several British or U.S.-built destroyers and frigates,although some are believed to be non-operational, and 6-10French-made Kama-class missiles boats.</TEXT></DOC>
