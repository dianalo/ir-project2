Gray Resigns From UTC Board</HEAD><DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Harry J. Gray, whose deal-making helpedbuild and redefine United Technologies Corp. into a defense andindustrial giant, has resigned from the company after 17 years.   Gray, who was thought to be preparing a takeover of UTC earlierthis year, retired as the company's chairman two years ago but hadcontinued on the board until Monday.   Gray would have been forced to retire from the board nextNovember when he turned 70, the mandatory retirment age for UTCdirectors.   Gray said an in interview Monday that his investment group, HarryGray, Mel Klein andamp; Partners, left him little time for UTC.   Last winter Gray teamed up with Texas businessman Melvyn N. Kleinand Chicago financiers Jay A. Pritzker and Thomas J. Pritzker toraise investment capital. In January, Gray, known by corporateinsiders as the ``father of the hostile takeover,'' denied rumorsthat his investment group was targeting UTC for takeover.   Gray said Monday that he was uninterested in any hostiletakeover, of UTC or any other company. ``Life's too short,'' he said.   Gray presided over an eightfold expansion of UTC's annual revenueand today the company rings up annual sales of $17 billion.   Gray's partnership was a co-investor in a group that lost in thefeverish bidding for RJR Nabisco Inc. after raising about $550million in capital.   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. won the fierce battle for RJRNabisco on Nov. 30 with a $24.53 billion bid.   ``In thinking over the requirement of times on something like RJRNabisco ... I decided that, in all fairness to the partnership andin all fairness to UTC, we probably were going to get into timeconflicts,'' Gray said.   UTC's chairman and chief executive officer, Robert F. Daniell,accepted Gray's resignation on Monday.   ``United Technologies will miss Harry's advice and counsel,''said Larry Bingaman, a UTC spokesman, adding that Gray was ``inlarge measure responsible for United Technologies becoming thecompany it is today.''   Gray was hired in 1971 as president of Connecticut's largestcompany, then known as United Aircraft and known mainly foraerospace products such as Pratt andamp; Whitney jet engines, Sikorskyhelicopters and Hamilton Standard propellers.   He soon added the titles chairman and chief executive officer andchanged the company's name to reflect a move into other businessessuch as Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners.</TEXT></DOC>
