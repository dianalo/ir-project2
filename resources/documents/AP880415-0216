ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson compared drug dealers to Klansmenon Friday and urged residents of a Queens housing project to``drive drugs out of your neighborhood.''   Campaigning for support in New York's Democratic presidentialprimary next Tuesday, Jackson walked through South Jamaica House, alow-income public housing project.   As he walked through the project hundreds of residents crowdedaround reaching out to shake his hand or, at least, touch his coat.Others waved from apartment windows.   ``Ropes, sheets and hoods represent death,'' he told them,adding that ``we never lost as many lives to Southern rope'' as todrugs.   ``The dope pusher, the dope trafficker, the drug warlordsthreaten the fabric of our lives,'' he said.   ``The dope pusher does not wear sheets and hoods, the dopepusher is the hood who lives in the neighborhood,'' said Jackson.   The crowd cheered when he urged them to join him in an effort torid their neighborhood of drugs.   ``Our minds must rebel against the drug pusher,'' he said. ``Ourattitudes must rebel against the drug pusher. Our morality mustrebel against the drug pusher.   ``We must drive drugs out of your neighborhood.''   From the project Jackson went to a drug rehabilitation centerrun by the Jamaica Community Action Program, where he said that``as president I can substantially cut the supply of drugs, but thepeople must cut down the demand for drugs.''   While he spoke Jackson aides passed out a written summary of hisanti-drug proposal, which includes a $2 billion increase in federalspending to combat trafficking.   At a breakfast meeting with community ministers, Jacksonridiculed Reagan administration anti-drug efforts, as well as thepositions being taken by his Democratic rivals.   He described Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. AlbertGore Jr. of Tennessee as captains and lieutenants in the waragainst drugs.   ``I'm the general in this war,'' he said.   ``Now, everybody's fighting for the homeless,'' he went on.``I'm a five-star general in that war.''   He said other candidates were beginning ``to focus on teenagemothers. Good, I'm the son of one.''   Jackson also referred repeatedly to the shutdown of theWilliamsburg Bridge, a main commuter route between Brooklyn andManhattan.   ``Because of lack of investment in the infrastructure, bridgesare falling,'' he said.   ``We must rebuild the people even as we are rebuilding thecity,'' he said.   Jackson later addressed several thousand people at a gay andlesbian rally for his campaign in Greenwich Village.   ``I stood with you because it was the right thing to do,'' hetold them.   His statement that ``Testing for AIDS must be voluntary andconfidential'' drew loud cheers from the crowd that extended a fullblock along 13th Street.</TEXT></DOC>
