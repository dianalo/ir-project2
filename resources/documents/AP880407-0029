The United Steelworkers union filed suit against the two Reaganadministration officials Wednesday in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in Philadelphia, which ordered the warnings last year.   Under ``right-to-know'' regulations ordered last May by thecourt and issued in August by the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration headed by Pendergrass, the Labor Department wasscheduled to begin levying fines of up to $10,000 when the warningsare absent.   However, the Office of Management and Budget headed by Millerhas delayed implementation of the new requirements. The budgetoffice claims some of the provisions run contrary to the 1980Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the mounting number of forms thatthe government requires businesses to handle.   In addition to the contempt citations, the Steelworkers want acourt order fully implementing the regulations as issued lastAugust by OSHA and an injunction prohibiting the administrationfrom taking any further action to thwart them.   Barbara Clay, a spokeswoman for the budget office, saidofficials have not seen the suit yet and, therefore, had no commenton it.   The Philadelphia appeals court is the same one that last Mayordered Pendergrass to issue the regulations or face a contemptcitation then.   The regulations require employers in several industries to makesure warning labels are on some 600,000 hazardous chemical productsin an estimated 3.5 million workplaces employing 18 million workers.   Administration officials have repeatedly cited the regulationsas negating the need for the government to warn workersindividually about health risks from exposure to carcinogens andother toxic substances.   Those arguments were instrumental last week in the Senate'sdefeat of a House-passed bill that would have required individualwarnings from the government to go out annually to some 300,000workers judged to be at the greatest risk.   The American Cancer Society had estimated those individualwarnings and medical monitoring programs based on them would haveprevented 250,000 cancer deaths over the next 10 years.   OSHA estimated that the ``right-to-know'' regulations wouldreduce chemically related injuries, illnesses and deaths innon-manufacturing industries by 20 percent a year.   The regulations were recommended in 1975 by a federal advisorycommission to combat the annual 100,000 deaths and 340,000disabling illnesses and injuries blamed on occupational diseases.   Formally known as the Hazard Communication Standard, thewarnings were imposed by OSHA on the chemical industry and its 1.4million workers in 1985.   A year later, under court orders in response to an earlier suitby the Steelworkers union, they were expanded to cover 14 millionmore workers employed by some 300,000 manufacturers.   Then the Philadelphia federal appeals court last May orderedOSHA to expand the requirements further to protect the 18 millionworkers in agriculture, construction, services, transportation andoffice occupations.   ``We'd thought that after a decade of litigation, we had wonthis fight,'' Margaret Seminario, a job health and safetyspecialist for the AFL-CIO, said Wednesday. ``Now OMB through theback door is trying to negate it all.''   The regulations do not ban any hazardous substances or order anyreductions in exposure. However they do require employers to postdata sheets offering information on each hazardous product and totrain workers on proper safeguards.   The White House budget office has demanded that constructionsites be excluded from the data sheet requirements.   And, in response to complaints from the formaldehyde industry,it also has disapproved language requiring warnings on buildingmaterials and permanent-press fabrics treated with that chemicalwhen they are shipped to apparel manufacturers.   While many employers had sought the regulations because theypre-empt state and local right-to-know laws that often were morestringent, others opposed them out of fears of potential lawsuits.   ``Documentary evidence has hung many a king, politician,financial wizard, whatever,'' said Robert Moran, a privateWashington attorney who specializes in workplace health and safetyissues. ``And that's what this regulation provides.''</TEXT></DOC>
