The move, which will delay parliamentary debate of the issue for several months, apparently has averted a political crisis for Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda's 11-month-old coalition government.    &quot;The copyright issue is the one thing that could bring down the government,&quot; said one political analyst. A rejection of the bill could have forced either the government's resignation or a dissolution of parliament.    By postponing the debate, government strategists hope to gain time to rally support for the measure and get it through the National Assembly.    The bill has revived popular resentment against the U.S. and polarized the already fractious government. Public debate on the bill began last month, after the cabinet decided to amend Thailand's 1978 Copyright Law to prevent plundering of literary and artistic works of U.S. origin.    To prompt Bangkok, Washington has threatened to remove or reduce benefits from the Generalized System of Preferences, which allows certain imports from developing countries to enter the U.S. duty free.    Until now, however, Thailand has resisted the pressure. The growth in cheap copies of videotapes, pharmaceuticals and other items has been a substantial source of income for the country. </TEXT></DOC>
