Members of theHTLV family contain genomes with a unique organization. In addition tothe replicative genes (gag, pol and env), an additional gene and itsproduct, a 42 kd protein, have been identified for HTLV-I and HTLV-II.This protein is likely to be important in initiation of transformation.Evidence suggests that it functions in transcriptional activation ofviral and cellular genes in a manner analogous to some DNA tumor virusproteins. Analysis of the HTLV-III genome is less extensive, but suggeststhat this virus also has an extra coding sequence at the 3' end. Differentisolates of HTLV-III exhibit considerable polymorphism, probably indicativeof the highly replicative nature of this virus. In addition, a largeamount of viral DNA persists in the unintegrated form both in continuouslyproducing cell lines and in fresh biopsied tissues of AIDS patients.This finding may be relevant to the cytopathic effect of this virus.</TEXT></DOC>
