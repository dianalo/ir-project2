The objectiveof this project is to understand and manage aging degradation of themajor light water reactor (LWR) structures and components. The main purposeof this project is to integrate, evaluate, and update the available andrelevant aging-related information. This paper discusses current accomplishmentsand summarizes the significant degradation processes active in the pressurizedwater reactor primary coolant system piping, feedwater piping, and nozzles.It evaluates the effectiveness of the current inservice inspection programsto detect degradation damage. Finally, it identifies the technical issuesthat need to be addressed to develop life assessment procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
