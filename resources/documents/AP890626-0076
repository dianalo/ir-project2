The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal of aruling favoring an employer in a case stemming from a 1979 strikeagainst a Texas laboratory supplies company.   Curtin Matheson Scientific Inc. was struck in 1979 by workers atits warehouse in Houston after a union contract expired and thecompany locked out all 27 Teamsters union members employed there.   Five of the 27 employees crossed the picket line when the strikebegan June 13, 1979. The company 12 days later hired 29 newemployees to replace the remaining 22 strikers.   When the union later offered to end the strike under termspreviously offered by management, the company withdrew the offeralong with its recognition of the union as the workers' bargainingagent.   The National Labor Relations Board in 1987 said the companyillegally withdrew its recognition of the union. The board said thecompany acted without adequate reason to believe the union lackedsupport from a majority of the workers then at the plant.   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the board lastNovember.   ``The company was justified in doubting that the strikerreplacements supported the union,'' the appeals court said.   Bush administration lawyers said the labor board properly refusedto accept the company's presumption that the union had lost thesupport of the majority of workers.   Strikebreakers may choose to work for financial reasons or theymay disapprove of a strike while still supporting the union, JusticeDepartment lawyers told the court.   The case is NLRB vs. Curtin Matheson, 88-1685.</TEXT></DOC>
