It isbeing examined by state regulators, law enforcement officialsand other parties to the rate case who have been concernedabout connections between attendance at the bawdy Floridagatherings and special deals with the company's MaterielEnterprises purchasing arm. The weeklong Florida parties wereorganized through 1988 by a top Nynex purchasing manager, whowas fired that year after a company investigation.</LP><TEXT>   A Nynex spokesman emphasized that the amount involved isrelatively small compared with the $215 million of goods andservices Materiel Enterprises bought over the 1984-1988period from all 33 suppliers represented at the pervertsconventions. During that period, Materiel Enterprises' totalpurchases amounted to $3.1 billion, much of which went to theregional phone company's former parent, American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.   The spokesman said the new data had no statisticallysignificant effect on a study it released late last monthshowing no correlation between suppliers' sales to MaterielEnterprises and attendance at the Florida gatherings.   Nevertheless, some &quot;pervert club&quot; companies that Nynex hadsaid it didn't do business with turned up on the new list ofpayments. Other companies, which Nynex officials said hadonly tiny transactions with Materiel Enterprises, actuallyreceived payments exceeding $1 million in some years. In all,about $10 million of payments were tracked on a MaterielEnterprises billing system, known as Xmap.   The Nynex spokesman said the Xmap system is used for goodsand services the company uses internally, such as paper clipsor temporary office help. A separate billing system was usedfor goods and services that Materiel Enterprises bought forresale to other Nynex companies.   The company has labeled the underlying sales data a tradesecret, covered by a protective order in the rate case.   But interviews and testimony submitted in the rate caseindicate that some unusual payments were made through theXmap system. For example, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., auto bodyshop whose owner was a friend of Lawrence Friedman -- theNynex manager who was fired for organizing the &quot;pervertsconventions&quot; -- received several hundred dollars one year.Earlier testimony in the rate case indicated the owner hadhelped to &quot;arrange for women&quot; to attend the gatherings.   Other recipients of Nynex payments included a movingcompany that hired another ex-Nynex employee who was firedfor his participation in the conventions. The moving companyreceived payments exceeding $1 million in both 1987 and 1988.   Scott J. Rafferty, a Nynex whistle-blower who wasdismissed in 1986 when the consulting operation he headed atNynex's tiny Telco Research unit was disbanded, said theadditional information flies in the face of earlier rate casetestimony. A redacted version of Mr. Rafferty's supplementaltestimony indicates that all attendees were either affiliatedwith Nynex or Nynex suppliers.   The company spokesman pointed out that company documentslisting suppliers and payments are trade secrets. &quot;We are putin the position of having to respond to a document&quot; that isconfidential, the Nynex spokesman complained.   The unearthed billing data weren't included in the 1988investigation of the perverts conventions conducted by Nynex.As a result of that probe, Nynex dismissed Mr. Friedman, whohad been a Materiel Enterprises vice president, and JohnMarino, who assisted Mr. Friedman in organizing the Floridaparties. Mr. Friedman, who settled a subsequent lawsuitagainst the company for $1 million, has moved to Florida.Nynex disciplined seven other employees who attended thegatherings, which included women hired to provideentertainment and sex for attendees. The company has said itshared the results of the investigation with regulators in1988.   The Nynex spokesman said the company hadn't focused ondata from the Xmaps system earlier because it believed thatproblems of favoritism among suppliers or harm to customerswould more likely show up in data from its other billingsystem, which generally handled larger transactions. A searchof that system indicated no problems, he said.   In response to its recent problems, Nynex announced lastweek that it was setting up a special ethics office and areview committee. Nynex Chairman William Ferguson also plansto send letters to employees assuring them that the companywon't retaliate against whistle-blowers.</TEXT></DOC>
