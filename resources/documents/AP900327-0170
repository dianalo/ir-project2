Statehood Appeal</HEAD><NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs to UPDATE with D.C. council voting to holdelection for `shadow' representatives to Congress.</NOTE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.N. officials shrugged off on Tuesday theRev. Jesse Jackson's threat to take the case for District ofColumbia statehood to the United Nations.   ``The U.N. does not grant statehood to states which are membersof federations, or independent states,'' Francois Giuliani,spokesman for the secretary-general, said Tuesday in answer to aquestion. He said it is not for the United Nations to conferstatehood, but only to consider membership.   He noted that U.N. membership is achieved through a process thatincludes recommendation by the 15-member Security Council, wherethe United States has veto power, and by a two-thirds vote of the159-nation General Assembly.   Jackson said Monday he may appeal to the United Nations as alast resort in his attempt to win statehood for the district. Hecomplained that the region was denied basic human rights andpolitical representation, and claimed the district was underpolitical occupation.   Lithuania, Tibet and other regions of U.N. member states allhave failed so far to achieve U.N. recognition, or often even towin U.N. comment on their independence movements involving theSoviet Union, China and other countries.   U.N. judicial experts considered the District of Columbia as onemore such case, an internal issue for the United States to resolve.   The United Nations frequently shuns touchy political issues,ranging from the use of poison gas to repression of politicaldissidents.   In Washington, meanwhile, the city council voted 12-1 Tuesday tohold elections for a ``shadow'' congressional delegation that wouldpress the city's quest for statehood on Capitol Hill.   The council's vote to hold a September primary and a Novembergeneral election balloting for the posts comes after three separatevotes in recent years to postpone the elections.</TEXT></DOC>
