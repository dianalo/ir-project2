The multiple computational resources of the machine must bemade available to the programming language compiler and to the programmerso that multitasking programs may be written. This thesis will explorethe additional complexity of programming a MIMD machine, the Cedar Multiprocessorspecifically, and the multitasking runtime system necessary to providemultitasking resources to the user. First, the problem will be well defined:the Cedar machine, its operating system, the programming language, andmultitasking concepts will be described. Second, a solution to the problem,called macrotasking, will be proposed. This solution provides multitaskingfacilities to the programmer at a very coarse level with many visiblemachine dependencies. Third, an alternate solution, called microtasking,will be proposed. This solution provides multitasking facilities of amuch finer grain. This solution does not depend so rigidly on the specificarchitecture of the machine. Finally, the two solutions will be comparedfor effectiveness. 12 refs., 16 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
