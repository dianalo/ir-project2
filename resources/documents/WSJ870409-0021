The line of credit of its Seaborn Development Inc. unit expired April 30, 1986.    As previously reported, the maker of automated manufacturing and processing equipment said it expects to post a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.8 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $728,000.    An Engineered Systems spokesman said the company &quot;has the ability and intent&quot; to pay the debt in installments over an 18-month period. He wouldn't say whether the company could pay immediately. He said negotiations with the bank, a unit of Wells Fargo andamp; Co., are continuing. </TEXT></DOC>
