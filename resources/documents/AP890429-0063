The date is as emotionally stirring to intellectual Chinese as1776 is to Americans or Bastille Day to the French.   It is the day in 1919 that Beijing University students launcheda campaign for science and democracy, showing intellectuals for thefirst time their power to lead the masses and affect policy.   Even before the April 15 death of a reformist official triggeredthe new protests, students were counting the days to celebrate the70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement.   Now, after having marched repeatedly on central Beijing'sTiananmen Square and staged the largest protests in 40 years ofcommunist rule, many students are studying the history of themovement to learn from its strategy.   ``It was China's Enlightenment,'' said one student marcher,referring to the 18th century science and democracy movement in theWest that gave rise to the American and French revolutions.   ``May Fourth divided Chinese history into two parts _ what camebefore and everything afterward,'' the student said. ``What we aredoing now is a continuation of May Fourth.''   The May Fourth Movement began with student anger over theVersailles Treaty that ended World War I. China's warlordgovernment agreed to treaty clauses that endorsed Japan's seizureof parts of China during the war.   More than 3,000 students from 13 Beijing schools, led by China'smost prestigious school, Beijing University, gathered May 4, 1919,at the Tiananmen gate to the former imperial palace.   They signed a manifesto denouncing the treaty, burned the houseof a government official and beat another as a ``traitor.''   Protests spread to other cities and were supported bynewspapers, worker strikes and boycotts of Japanese-made goods. Thegovernment quickly backed down and rejected the Versailles Treaty,but the protests did not stop.   Galvanized by their new sense of power, the students thendemanded sweeping democratic reforms and adoption of Westernscientific thinking. China's traditional culture made it weak andripe for foreign invasion, the students argued.   The movement trained a generation of intellectuals in politicalactivism. Many went on to support the communists in the civil warthat ended in 1949 with communist victory.   ``But for the May Fourth Movement, there would have been noChinese revolution,'' He Xin, a scholar, said at one of a series ofsymposiums being held in China to commemorate the anniversary.   The official symposiums have been careful to stress thatprotests may have been appropriate then, but not now.   However, student protesters and older intellectuals say they areangry that so little progress toward establishing a democratic,scientific system has been made.   ``Seventy Years,'' lamented one banner carried in Thursday'smarch by 150,000 students and supporters on Tiananmen, the symbolicseat of power in China and rallying place for protesters.   ``We haven't yet achieved the society we hoped for,'' said88-year-old Bing Xin, one of modern China's leading writers and aparticipant in the original May Fourth Movement.   ``We can speak out, but our words have little effect. We are notyet satisfied,'' she said in a rare interview. ``The rule of man isstill more important than rule of law.''   Bing Xin said the 1919 movement won widespread support becauseit had a popular goal _ opposing Japanese imperialism _ as well asthe vaguer slogans of science and democracy. ``Those were new wordsin China, and many people didn't know what they meant,'' she said.   In a country where one-quarter of the population is illiterate,many people today still don't understand the student calls forscience and democracy.   But they understand the students' protests of officialprivilege, nepotism and profiteering. Thousands of workers joinedThursday's march, and many cited corruption as the reason.   Officials ``turn public funds into their own private wealth,''fumed one taxi driver. ``Of course I support the students.''   Out-of-uniform soldiers and police also have expressed sympathy,and some have sent letters of support to Beijing Universitystudents.   However, today's students are finding it harder than in 1919 toturn this silent support into action, in part because of governmentcontrol over jobs, housing and other necessities.   ``I can't just find another job, and I depend on my work unitfor housing and my child's education,'' said one worker.   Older intellectuals also are fearful of showing support. Manyhave been jailed, criticized or sent to the countryside during pastleftist campaigns.   But perhaps the strongest factor discouraging protests fromspreading to all sectors of society, as in 1919, is a deep yearningamong most Chinese for peace.   Memories are vivid of the 1966-76 far leftist CulturalRevolution, Mao Tse-tung's final effort to perpetuate classstruggle. Thousands of people were killed and tens of thousandssuffered.   One university teacher who applauded the students said it isthis memory that keeps him from marching. ``In my heart, I don'twant another Cultural Revolution.''</TEXT></DOC>
