We did experience some difficulties with the initial LBO terms and, as your article made clear, successfully restructured our debt earlier this year, something those other retailers have yet to accomplish.    Your were on target regarding industry problems, but wide of the mark in portraying the financial health of this company.    DAVID R. WATERS    Chairman and CEO    Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc.
