On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 26 centsto settle at $19.29 a barrel. On Monday, the April contract pickedup 53 cents, closing above $19 a barrel for the first time sinceJan. 19.   Refined products traded on the exchange also advanced Tuesday.The April contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.34 cent to settle at53.50 cents a gallon, while heating oil edged up 0.05 cent to closeat 52.40 cents a gallon.   Andrew Lebow, a senior broker with E.D.andamp;F. Man InternationalFutures Inc., partly attributed the gains to news that Saudi Arabiawas cutting back on crude shipments to Japan by 45,000 barrels a day.   The report sparked buying on Far East oil markets, which in turninfluenced prices in Europe and New York, Lebow said.   Traders interpreted the development as further evidence theSaudis, the largest producers in the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, were abiding by their 4.5 million-barrel dailyquota for crude output, Lebow said.   OPEC members set an overall ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a daylate last year. Analysts have said the cartel appeared to be holdingto its quota.   Lebow said some buying Tuesday came on momentum from gains a dayearlier, which were partly attributed to a fire that forced theclosing of seven Norwegian crude oil fields in the North Sea.   The seven fields produce an average of 250,000 barrels a day ofcrude oil and about 1 billion cubic feet of gas.</TEXT></DOC>
