On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract forWest Texas Intermediate oil, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose34 cents to close Thursday at $17.42 a barrel. The contract lost 28cents on Wednesday.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the Februarycontract for home heating oil closed at 53.47 cents a gallon, up0.82 cent, after falling 0.58 cent Wednesday.   February wholesale unleaded gasoline, which gained 0.05 cent inthe previous session, ended up 0.08 cent to 47.40 cents a gallon.   Jerry Samuels, an energy analyst with Shearson Lehman HuttonInc., attributed the stronger market tone to a combination oftechnical factors and general optimism that the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will adhere to newoutput quotas that took effect Jan. 1.   ``The market appears to be giving OPEC the benefit of the doubt,at least until we see the actual production figures,'' Samuels said.   On the technical side, he said, the market was boosted by thefact that WTI has remained above $17 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
