Terms weren't disclosed.    Busch Industrial Products, which had 1987 sales of about $80 million, makes compressed baker's yeast in the U.S. at plants in Old Bridge, N.J., Bakersfield, Calif., and St. Louis.    Anheuser-Busch said in its latest annual report that price competition in the baker's yeast industry has become intense and that the yeast unit may no longer be consistent with the company's business strategy. The beer maker said it expects an &quot;immaterial gain&quot; from the sale.    Gist-Brocades, whose core businesses include yeasts, antibiotics, enzymes and pharmaceutical specialties, said the transaction will give it entry into the U.S. compressed baker's yeast market.    Separately, Burns, Philp andamp; Co. said it plans to acquire from Gist-Brocades certain Midwest assets of Busch Industrial Products. Sydney, Australia-based Burns Philp, which owns Fleischmann's Yeast in the U.S., said it plans to build a new yeast plant in Memphis, Tenn. </TEXT></DOC>
