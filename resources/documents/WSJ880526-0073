Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's leading computer maker, and NEC Corp., its largest semiconductor maker, both reported strong profit gains yesterday. Other major companies in the industrial-electronics sector, such as Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Toshiba Corp., are expected to report earnings increases today.    A recession in the semiconductor market had contributed to a decline in earnings at Japanese chip makers in the two preceding fiscal years. But semiconductor prices rose in the latest year, reflecting a recovery in world-wide demand for computers and other office-automation equipment, as well as the 1986 U.S.-Japan semiconductor accord, which was meant to boost chip prices and stop alleged Japanese dumping in third-country markets.    Analysts said that after the accord was reached, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry closely supervised Japanese semiconductor prices and production, which ultimately helped boost profits. In a report published early this year, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute, an affiliate of Nomura Securities Co., said that &quot;without MITI's involvement, the severity of the last recession makes it an open question whether the industry could recover so quickly.&quot;    Most Japanese analysts also are optimistic about the industry's prospects for the current fiscal year. An analyst at Nikko Research Center, an affiliate of Nikko Securities Co., said, &quot;There are no bad factors&quot; ahead.    Fujitsu yesterday reported that unconsolidated, or parent-company, pretax profit rose 166% from the prior fiscal year, to 60.45 billion yen ($486.9 million) from 22.70 billion yen. Net income rose 97%, to 32.07 billion yen from 16.28 billion yen, while sales grew 16%, to 1.714 trillion yen ($13.81 billion) from 1.482 trillion yen.    NEC posted a 42% gain in pretax profit, to 74.18 billion yen from 52.29 billion yen. Net gained 33%, to 37.48 billion yen from 28.12 billion yen. Sales rose 8.5%, to 2.304 trillion yen from 2.123 trillion yen.    On a consolidated basis, Fujitsu announced a 122% rise in pretax earnings, to 83.72 billion yen from 37.66 billion yen; a 95% gain in net, to 42.12 billion yen from 21.61 billion yen; and a 14% increase in sales, to 2.046 trillion yen from 1.789 trillion yen. NEC didn't issue consolidated data.    In Japan, pretax profit is considered the most meaningful measure of a company's performance; net-income figures often reflect a juggling of special reserve funds.    Fujitsu's unconsolidated revenue from exports totaled 316.3 billion yen, up 16%. That represented 18.4% of sales, unchanged from the year before. But NEC's exports fell 1.8% on the year, to 591.3 billion yen, because of the yen's appreciation. Its exports represented 25.7% of sales, down from 28.3% the year before.    Fujitsu and NEC attributed the sharp earnings rise to the recovery in the semiconductor market, brisk computer sales and cost reductions. Fujitsu said its sales-to-cost ratio improved to 67.7% from 70.3% in the preceding year.    At Fujitsu, revenue from semiconductor sales rose 19.4%, to 200 billion yen, the sharpest growth among the company's three major product areas. Computer sales gained 14.5%, to 1.2 trillion yen, and sales of telecommunications equipment rose 18.5%, to 281.7 billion yen. The rise in sales of telecommunications equipment reflected stepped-up purchases of digital switches and optical fibers by Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp.    At NEC, revenue from semiconductor sales rose 13.2%, to 433.4 billion yen. Sales of computers and peripherals increased 12.7%, to 1.04 trillion yen, while sales of telecommunications equipment rose 5.6%, to 722.3 billion yen.    For the current fiscal year, Fujitsu is forecasting unconsolidated pretax profit of 80 billion yen, up 32%, on sales of 1.95 trillion yen, up 14%. NEC estimates its pretax profit will rise to 85 billion yen, up 15%, on sales of 2.45 trillion yen, up 6.3%.    The analyst at Nikko Research Center said capital spending by Japanese semiconductor makers is expected to increase this year but won't cut into earnings. He also expects a solid performance by the companies' computer and telecommunications divisions as a result of increasing investment in office automation by Japanese customers. </TEXT></DOC>
