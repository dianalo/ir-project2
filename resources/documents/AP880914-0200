Lebanon radio and U.S. officials have said Kenneth P. Wells, 25,was an American engineer who overpowered his captors after he waskidnapped on Sunday. He reportely works in Saudi Arabia for LittonIndustries and holds a black belt in karate.   The group, calling itself the National Progressive Alliance,claimed it captured Wells because he was on an espionage missionand then released him. The claims were in a note delivered to thewest Beirut office of the Italian ANSA news agency and wereaccompanied by photos of Wells' U.S. driver's license and his SaudiArabian work permit.   It was the first known statement from the previously unheard ofgroup. An ANSA employee said the note was found in a white envelopeleft at the doorstep of the agency office after someone rang thedoorbell and left.   Wells was abducted briefly with his new Shiite Moslem bride,Nadia Haydar Sharafeddine, shortly after the couple wed Sunday ineast Lebanon's ancient city of Baalbek.   But reports varied as to how the couple gained freedom.   Lebanese press reports Monday said Wells used karate to disarmhis captives and escape.   Syrian government sources said the Syrian troops who controleast Lebanon's Bekaa valley rescued the couple after a nightlongsearch and took them to the Syrian capital of Damascus, where theywere turned over to the U.S. Embassy.   ``In recent days, CIA Col. Kenneth Paul Wells sneaked into theterritory of our beloved country on an open spying mission for awhole month under the pretext of marrying a Lebanese,'' said thestatement from the group.   ``Our courageous strugglers, however, were alert. They chasedhim, arrested him, interrogated him and warned him to leave Lebanonat once. Then they freed him, hoping that the Americans will getthe message that we emphatically reject their overt interference inour internal affairs,'' the statement added.   It accused the United States of ``harboring animosity to ournationalist causes and supporting the enemies of our people and theArab nation.''   The statement also expressed support for Syrian President HafezAssad.   The language of the statement suggests the group behind it maybe leftist rather than the pro-Iranian Shiite extremists believedto be holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon.   Nine Americans are among the hostages, including Terry Anderson,40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.Anderson, the longest held of all the hostages, was abducted March16, 1985 in Beirut.   The photo with the statement was of a driver's license issued inBremerton, Wash., and Wells' work permit, issued by the SaudiMinistry of Defense and Aviation. It listed him as a maintenancetechnician and is valid until June 29, 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
