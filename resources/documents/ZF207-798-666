(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Synergy at FininvestandM;A diversification drive that shifted into high gear four years agotransformed Fininvest Group SpA from a local construction company into a $9.4billion conglomerate.andP;  Along the way, the Milan-based multinational picked upholdings in television, film production and distribution, publishing,advertising, insurance, sports, finance and retailing.andP;  Adding the essentialelement of cohesiveness to this mixed bag of businesses is the firm's strongIS arm, Fininvest Servizi, which actually embodies the eclectic company'smotto Sinergia di Gruppo or &quot;Group Synergy.&quot;andM;&quot;Much of the group synergy is coming together through informationtechnology,&quot; affirms Fininvest Servizi MIS director Anthony Rodino Dandolo.andO;He applauds company president and chairman Silvio Berlusconi's business, aswell as systems, sense: &quot;Silvio Berlusconi is a kind of visionary.andP;  Hisinstinct for a good business venture is better than that of most of hiscontemporaries.andP;  It was amazing that from the beginning he saw the importanceof developing strong information services within the company.&quot;andM;And from the beginning, Berlusconi made his acquisitions with a view towardthe future.andP;  This is in contrast to other companies that make acquisitionswith a sharp eye on the short term and the bottom line.andP;  When acquisitionsare made by such companies, Dandolo says, the separate IS divisions &quot;areusually kept independent, so that if things don't work out, lopping off thesedivisions doesn't affect the IS core.&quot;andM;&quot;Fininvest is different,&quot; Dadolo maintains.andP;  &quot;Acquisitions are for the longterm.andP;  And there's an effort to integrate and think for the long term.andP;  Weplan to keep a centralized IS core, which means that information systems isthe unifying element for the whole group and the one that keeps everyonetalking the same language.&quot;andM;To help keep all of Fininvest's diverse operations talking the same language,Dandolo created special technology integration teams, drawing its membersfrom different areas of the conglomerate.andP;  These groups, which study projectsand plan strategies for particular technologies, are always looking forpotential applications that can be shared throughout the company.andM;Fininvest systems director Gian Michele Ottina must have had some specialstrategies of his own in mind four years ago when he hired Dandolo to fillthe MIS director's chair.andP;  Dandolo, a Venetian by birth, had become a U.S.andO;citizen while working in America between 1965 and 1985.andP;  In the States, hehad held a series of information technology jobs, including positions at IBM.andM;Returning to his native land in 1985 to work for Fininvest, Dandolo wasquickly faced with the special challenges presented by his acquisitivecompany.andP;  The day after his arrival at Fininvest, the firm bought theMediolanum insurance company.andP;  The next year, the growing group begantelevision operations in France with the La Cinq network.andP;  That was swiftlyfollowed up with other TV deals in Spain, West Germany and Yugoslavia.andP;  Alsoin that busy year of 1986, Fininvest purchased the A.C.andP;  Milan Football Club.andM;The Takeover GuppyandM;But the takeover destined to have the most dramatic impact on the group andits IS division came in late 1988 when Fininvest bought the Standa retailstore chain.andP;  Berlusconi's purchase of the retail giant from Raul Gardini'sFerruzzi Group was like a guppy swallowing a fish.andP;  The guppy, with 8,000employees, had hooked a big fish with 17,000 employees.andP;  What could proveeven harder to swallow for Fininvest was Standa's 1988 net loss of over L42billion ($30.3 million).andM;Nevertheless, the profits and synergy that could potentially be produced bythe union proved to be enticing incentives for Fininvest.andP;  Standa, which hasstores in over 250 locations throughout Italy, immediately provided theconglomerate with an established customer base from which it could sell itsgoods and services.andP;  Fininvest, for instance, may want to set up in-storecounters for financial services, personal insurance or tourism--many of thecompany's prime business areas.andP;  These services may also be offered on aninternational basis, since Standa may go global after 1992.andM;What Sanda sorely needs is new technologies.andP;  And this need represents anopportunity for Fininvest.andP;  &quot;We're getting into higher technologies with theStanda purchase,&quot; Dandolo explains.andP;  &quot;It's no longer a case of developmentprojects needing simple programming, as it was when we got into the insurancebusiness.andP;  Technology can play a major role in making Standa synergistic inthe group.andP;  Technology will be strategic for the stores' growth, and thestores will be strategic for the group's growth.&quot;andM;Technology for Retail GrowthandM;Dandolo goes on to illustrate his strategic synergism point with the exampleof scanner and point-of-sale (POS) technology.andP;  &quot;By itself,&quot; he says, &quot;thistechnology is well known.andP;  But its potential isn't.andP;  There are no modelsanywhere, not even in the U.S., where this technology is being usedstrategically,&quot; he insists.andM;Hoping to create this model, Fininvest Servizi wants to take the productsales data from store scanners and POS terminals and tie it directly intoadvertising in the group's publications or into its television networks.andO;Advertisers buy space in Fininvest media through Fininvest's advertisingdivision.andP;  Publitalia, which has offices throughout Europe.andM;Thiw would work in the following way: if the TV program &quot;Dallas&quot; wins astrong 25% share of the viewing audience on Tuesday evening, then, in theory,the sales of the products being sold by advertisers during the show couldpick up the following day.andP;  So, if Standa's grocery departments sold out ofspaghetti from &quot;Dallas&quot; advertiser Barilla on Wednesday, this could bequickly discovered by reviewing the scanner data that would show the volumeof sales.andM;The Project MagnetandM;Such a scheme could be used by Fininvest's advertising division to validatead placements and help a client plan media schedules.andP;  Under this setup,audience share information could be delivered first thing the next morningvia computer to all relevant Fininvest managers.andM;That particular information service is expected to be part of FininvestServizi's progetto magnetto or &quot;project magnet,&quot; which is actually a decisionsupport system for the company's managers.andP;  In the case mentioned above, thesystem will help Publitalia's managers plan better media stategies for itsclients.andM;Currently in the final stages of design, Fininvest's decision support systemis already being used in some parts of the company.andP;  In developing progettomagnetto, Fininvest Servizi used computer-aided software engineering (CASE)tools.andP;  The IS team is currently doing much of its development chores onworkstations using CASE technology.andM;Two major efforts have been undertaken to achieve technical integrationbetween the Fininvest Group and the Standa chain.andP;  First, Standa is replacingits IBM-oriented electronic mail and communications protocols with groupstandards that can accommodate diversity.andP;  Second, the hardware and softwaremaintenance personnel from Fininvest and Standa are being consolidated underone roof.andP;  The programmers and analysts from each firm, however, willcontinue to be decentralized.andM;Integrating Corporate CulturesandM;Technical integration should eliminate duplicate positions and assure moreconsistent control of all group systems.andP;  Since Berlusconi wants to add over100 new Standa locations by 1992, it is essential that a coherent ISstructure incorporating Standa be established.andP;  It is equally essential thatthe structure be flexible, allowing for fast future growth.andM;Integrating the technology of the two companies is one thing, but integratingtwo disparate corporate cultures is quite another.andP;  The disparity can beattributed to the different histories of the two companies.andP;  The staid retailchain has been in business for over 50 years, half the time of the dynamicand diversified Fininvest.andP;  As a result, the IS staffs at the two companieshave markedly different attitudes and may find themselves at odds with eachother, as the comments of one source at Fininvest Servizi suggest.andP;  IStanda's IS people, he says, don't believe that anyone outside the retailbusiness can understand the job or find new solutions for dealing with oldproblems.andM;This resistance has been met with some good management from FininvestServizi.andP;  Both Dandolo and Ottina are trying to bring a fresh spirit to theStanda relationship.andP;  They are doing this by making sure that Standa's peopleare involved in group decisions and functions.andP;  For example, when Fininvestmanagers took a cruise to Barcelona last May to see the European Cup match inwhich Fininvest's A.C.andP;  Milano Football Club was playing, Standa IS managersshared the deck with Fininvest Servizi managers.andP;  Overall, the group istaking a soft approach during the transition.andP;  While there have been somechanges in management at Standa, no one has been cut.andM;Dandolo thinks personnel management is more important than technicalmanagement for a firm such as Fininvest that intends to grow throughdiversification and acquisitions.andP;  To Dandolo, people are an important factorin realizing the synergy that such acquisitions could produce.andP;  People, hesays, need clear goals and incentives in order to realize their potential.andO;This is especially important, he notes, in a union-dominated culture such asItaly's.andM;And more acquisitions may already be in the making.andP;  There's been talk thatFininvest may soon take over another retail store chain.andP;  Such a move wouldbe designed to strengthen Standa, which is strong in Italy but weak incomparison to foreign competitors.andP;  Other European retail companies couldpotentially buy out Standa in 1992, when they can start doing business inItaly.andM;Berlusconi also has his eye on pay television, which is ripe to be exploitedin a country that has so far skipped the whole cable era.andP;  Also on thegrapevine are rumors that the group will build its sports muscle by goingafter baseball, basketball, hockey and rugby teams.andM;Team PlayersandM;Team spirit, afterall, is the basis of the company's whole synergy notion.andO;Such team thinking is also the hallmark of the enlightened Americanmanagement mentality, Dadolo says.andP;  &quot;I brought many influences from theU.S.,&quot; he says of his own management style.andP;  &quot;I've tried to build a solidframework for people from different areas with conflicting attitudes--aframework in which they can work together and do their best.&quot;andM;Janette Martin is a freelance writer who specializes in technology topics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
