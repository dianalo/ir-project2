Birch </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><IN> ECO </IN><TEXT>   If small business has a high priest, it is David L. Birch.    When Massachusetts Institute of Technology published his seminal paper, &quot;The Job Generation Process,&quot; in 1979, he awoke economists to the overpowering role of small business in the national economy. It was small firms, he found -- not the big auto and steel and computer companies -- that were creating virtually all the new jobs in America.    Today, as the president of Cognetics Inc., a marketing-consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Birch maintains the nation's largest private repository of small-business histories, involving some 8.1 million individual corporations, based on data provided by Dun andamp; Bradstreet. There is the Fortune 500. And there is the Cognetics eight Million.    He calls this an &quot;economic microscope,&quot; because, as he explains, the figures &quot;allow us to look at the economy one business address at a time.&quot; In the following article written for this Wall Street Journal Report, Mr. Birch trains his microscope on the critical, yet volatile, role of small business not only in creating jobs but in consuming products, services and investment capital.    ---   THE STOCK MARKET crashes -- yet the unemployment rate falls. One large company after another announces major layoffs -- yet national employment soars. What's going on?    We are living in a nation of two economies, one visible, one hidden.    The Visible Economy dominates the New York Stock Exchange. Its members have big names, big facilities and appear in the business press all the time. They used to dominate the world economy -- but they are now under great international pressure. They find themselves with older processes, older equipment, surplus people and high costs. Many have been forced to undergo painful restructuring. From 1980 to 1987, the Fortune 500 companies alone have eliminated 3.1 million people from their payrolls -- net. This is the equivalent of laying off the entire work force, public and private, of Massachusetts.    The Hidden Economy consists of millions of smaller firms, the vast majority of which are privately held, publish little information about their activities and rarely appear in the business press. From 1980-87, the non-Fortune 500 Economy created 17 million jobs. Some (about 1.3 million) were created in the public sector, and some (though not many) by major service firms. But the corporate behemoths of the service sector are following in the footsteps of the industrial companies. We read daily of major layoffs by banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies, retailers and even consulting companies.    It is the growth of the Hidden Economy -- these millions of small, private businesses -- that cushions the shock of a crashing Dow, that absorbs the workers cut loose by big firms when they restructure and that created most of those 17 million jobs.    The Hidden Economy is also one of the world's great markets. It has created far more jobs since 1980 than either Europe or Japan. It is a major consumer of computers, office space, furniture, insurance, investment dollars and services of all kinds. It is time we paid some attention to it.    Figure 1 gives some sense of the numbers involved in terms of employment. These basic proportions don't change much over time. As the giants downsize, the percent of the jobs at the top of the pyramid becomes somewhat smaller and the percent at the bottom a little bigger -- but not by much.    Underlying the apparent stability, however, is complete chaos. We observe tremendous movement of firms -- in and out of the economy, as well as up and down within it, as Figure 2 shows. Since 1980 we have experienced a true &quot;atomization&quot; of the American economy. Firms have been dropping almost as fast as they have been starting. The turnover rate is quite high. As you might expect, small ones are more likely to drop out than big ones.    But it's the balance that counts: The smaller firms more than make up for their higher closing rate with fresh starts and growth. The larger ones are not able to offset their heavy layoffs with growth elsewhere. On balance, the smaller firms have accounted for virtually all of the net jobs created in the past four years, as Figure 3 indicates.    It turns out that most of the &quot;replacement jobs&quot; -- those that offset the layoffs and closings -- are concentrated in a relatively few firms that grow a great deal, as Figure 4 shows. The great majority of these &quot;super stars&quot; start small. These are the makers of Apple or Compaq computers, the Lotus Development corporations, or the Mrs. Fields Cookies -- firms that were very small very recently, and have exploded into a market niche, sometimes of their own creation.    For all their differences, rapidly growing firms share one overarching characteristic: Their growth tends to be erratic, even volatile. If they go straight up, they would be easy to identify and track. But they don't. Looking at the experience of about four million firms between 1983 and 1987, only 8.8% of the biggest growers in the first two years sustained rapid growth in the next two years; almost as many closed up entirely, and practically as many were likely to decline as grow. By far the most likely group to grow rapidly in the second half were the ones that had declined the most in the first half. &quot;Stable&quot; is practically the worst state to be in. Firms that were stable in 1983-85 were the least likely to grow in the following two years, and were tied with big decliners as the most likely to fold. Growth in the Hidden Economy is an elusive commodity indeed.    Does this wild and crazy game go on everywhere, or is it characteristically American? It's very American. We have trained our microscope on the U.K., Canada, and Sweden, and have examined the similar analyses conducted for other nations. U.S. turbulence levels are much higher: We start and close far more companies in percentage terms than most and experience far more layoffs and plant closings than most.    The major exception may be Japan. From what we can gather from published statistics, beneath the veneer of the large, publicly visible trading companies lie a host of smaller, rapidly growing companies that now account for virtually all of Japan's growth.    It appears that turbulence is a price that we (and the Japanese) pay to facilitate innovation and job creation, and that nations that are unwilling to pay that price -- such as in Europe -- are also unable to create job opportunities. Job growth in the U.S. has been thirty times greater than job growth in Europe over the past 15 years.    In addition to driving the creation of jobs, our country's Hidden Economy is a huge market -- one of the healthiest new marketplaces in the world. It's booming right in your back yard. But it's a tough one to identify and sell to. Of the seven million or so firms that comprise it, only 6% or 7% are growing much and have noteworthy needs. Most of these begin life as very small firms -- a time when they are building relationships with suppliers, but when they are also difficult to find. Thankfully, however, they are numerous. The Hidden Economy today includes about 500,000 explosively growing firms.    The turbulence within the Hidden Economy, as well as the huge layoffs among larger firms, has forced tremendous mobility in the work force. One out of five American workers leaves his job each year, about half of that number involuntarily. About one in ten has to change occupations each year. It is not at all uncommon today for a person to go through four or five careers during a working lifetime.    For the employer -- large or small -- this mobility can turn into a nightmare. Just when you get people trained, they leave. Just when you get enough of them trained, growth turns into retrenchment, recruitment gives way to outplacement. More and more employees are lower and lower on the learning curve. For the large firm, it's expensive and inefficient. For the small one, with few training facilities, it can be a disaster.    The nightmare is worse for the roughly one-half of the exiting work force that exits involuntarily. Often the growing companies are not located in the same area as the declining ones.    Often the growing companies require different skills than the declining ones. The hardship for those who must move and change careers (many times with loss of pay) is real and growing. Unfortunately, volatility, restructuring, competitiveness and growth are all closely coupled. If we must restructure and innovate to remain competitive, then our top priority must be to find a way to turn career changes into opportunities rather than hardships.    A Hidden Economy poses a peculiar challenge to investors. Virtually none of its members are listed or publicly traded. There is no market for its shares and thus virtually no liquidity of the type that traditional investors are accustomed to. There is little information, such as stock indices, that can trace its successes and failures. There is no obvious mechanism by which pension funds or mutual funds or insurance companies can invest in it.    Yet the capital needs of the Hidden Economy are huge. Assume that each of the 1.3 million new enterprises each year requires $25,000 on average to get started. Roughly 500,000 smaller, rapidly growing companies require an additional $100,000 each year to sustain their growth. That's a total annual, net new capital need of $82 billion. The entire venture-capital industry provides $2 billion in a good year. In a strong stock market, such as in 1986, the investment-banking community provides about $15-20 billion through initial public offerings. The rest of the money must be found in what is frequently a very inefficient manner from a diverse assortment of non-institutional sources -- second mortgages on homes, forgone salaries, small investment pools, friends, relatives and the like. The challenge is to find a more efficient mechanism for funneling capital into what has become the major source of growth in our economy.    In sum, the Hidden American Economy is one of the greatest economies of the world. It represents a huge opportunity for those who wish to market products, to invest or to pursue new careers. It is not an easy economy to tap into -- it is diverse, erratic and difficult to keep track of. The payoff for those who make the effort, however, will be very great indeed in a time when payoffs from the Visible Economy are far smaller.    ---   Figure 1                     Where the Jobs Are    The vast majority of American companies employ fewer than 100 workers. Almost half of all people work for firms with fewer than 500 employees, and about two thirds work for the non-giants, i.e., firms with fewer than 5,000 employees.
