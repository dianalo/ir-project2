The delivery by IBM is the first computer hardware and softwarefor Freedom's data management system.   Engineers at NASA and its contractor companies will use it totest their design for the space station's other subsystems.Programmers will use it as a working model on which to write andtest software programs.   The system will provide data processing and local communicationsfor the station's basic operations and its payloads.   ``The data management system is the integrating element of SpaceStation Freedom _ the `glue' that connects the many differentsystems and helps them work together,'' said Michael W. Dawkins,general manager of the IBM Systems Integration Division facility inHouston that is developing the onboard computer system.   IBM performed the work for McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co., amajor contractor for the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration.</TEXT></DOC>
