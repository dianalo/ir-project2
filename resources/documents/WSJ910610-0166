If you're like a growing number ofAmericans, you're looking at a home-equity loan.   And if you're not, banks are doing their best to point youin that direction. Seeing home-equity loans and credit linesas a bright spot in a bleak lending landscape, many areoffering low teaser rates for the first year; others arewaiving closing costs and other fees.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Home-equity loans are our No. 1 strategic consumerlending product,&quot; says Donald Grigley, senior vice presidentof Shawmut Bank, Hartford, Conn., which charges no fees forloans under $50,000.   Indeed, home-equity borrowing is cheaper than it has beenin a long time, both because of falling rates and bankcompetition. That and the fact that interest remainsgenerally tax deductible makes home-equity loans and creditlines more attractive than ever. As a result, homeowners areusing them for everything from making investments to payingmedical bills.   That worries some in the industry. &quot;You can get a car or aboat or take vacations on your home,&quot; says Keith Gumbinger,spokesman at HSH Associates, a consumer lending informationcompany in Butler, N.J. But if you get laid off and can't payoff the loan, he says, it's the house, not the car, that youcould lose.   Home-equity borrowing comes in two varieties. Home-equityloans, the current jargon for traditional second mortgages,let homeowners borrow a given amount for a set period ateither a fixed or variable rate. Open-ended home-equity linesof credit let people borrow whenever they want, up to a setlimit. These typically have variable rates pegged to theprime rate, a benchmark used by banks in setting interestrates on many loans to businesses and individuals.   A major attraction of home-equity borrowing is that UncleSam still picks up part of the tab. Interest on borrowings upto $100,000 is still tax-deductible. In contrast, interest oncredit cards, auto loans and other types of consumer creditcan no longer be written off.   Moreover, home-equity borrowing is cheaper than many othertypes of credit, even without taking the tax deduction intoaccount. The average rate on home-equity credit lines iscurrently 10.25%, says Robert K. Heady, publisher of BankRate Monitor newsletter in North Palm Beach, Fla. Bycomparison, he says, the average credit-card rate is 18.95%,unsecured personal-loan rates average 17.09% and rates onnew-car loans average 11.72%.   Mr. Heady notes that both credit card and personal loanrates have actually risen since overall interest ratesstarted to fall in April 1989, while home-equity lines ofcredit have dropped more than three percentage points, withhalf of that decline in the past five months alone.   Banks like home-equity lending because of the low defaultrates and affluent borrowers. They can lend more money at onetime then they could with several car loans, and the loansare collateralized by people's houses. In addition, lenderslike attracting stable, educated consumers who may decide tobuy other bank products.   Hence, they are going to some length to attract borrowers.In Ashtabula, Ohio, People's Savings Bank is promoting itsvariable-rate second mortgage, offering a 9.375% rate ifpayments are automatically made from a borrower's account.All fees are waived. Its home-equity line of credit iscurrently pegged at 9.5% with closing costs of $275.   Chase U.S. Consumer Services Inc., Edison, N.J., isoffering a one-year introductory rate of 8.5%, the currentprime rate, on a typical home-equity line of credit. Thatjumps to prime plus 1.5 percentage points in the secondthrough 10th years. Closing costs on a $100,000 line ofcredit would range from $500 to $800, with no application feeor annual fee.   Despite the aggressive marketing, lenders are being moreconservative about loans they approve. While some still letpeople borrow 100% of the equity in their homes, it is morecommon to see loan-to-equity values of 80%, 75% or even 70%.A year-end survey by the Consumer Bankers Association, atrade group, shows that lenders are taking longer to processapplications and that borrowers have owned their homeslonger, earned more and had their job longer than in 1989.   Banks are also charging more fees, says Bank RateMonitor's Mr. Heady. Annual fees of $30 or more are showingup at a growing number of banks. And borrowers who take out aline of credit but don't use it may now get socked withinactivity fees of $50 to $150.   There are other caveats. Mr. Heady cautions that peopleshould be careful with loans that charge interest only for aset period. While most lenders then amortize the loan over 10or 15 years, others call for immediate payment of allprincipal.   Comparison shoppers should also check the loan's lifetimeinterest-rate cap, which limits how high rates can go overthe life of the loan. These caps currently range from as highas 25% to as low as 14.5%, says HSH's Mr. Gumbinger. Suchcaps are important, he says, noting that the prime rate hit21.5% in 1980.   Some people like to arrange home-equity lines of credit,but not use them except in emergencies. Financial plannerMichael Whelchel of Financial Management Group of Virginia inMcLean recommends that people within two years of retirementopen a line of credit. &quot;Once your income stops, the bankswon't approve you very easily,&quot; he says.   One final note of caution: While interest from home-equityloans is currently tax-deductible, there's no guarantee itwill stay that way. Remembering how the government &quot;pulledthe rug&quot; on tax shelters in 1986, Mr. Whelchel tells affluentclients contemplating big home-equity loans that thewrite-offs could suddenly end.</TEXT></DOC>
