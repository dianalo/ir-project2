Keepers at San Diego Wild Animal Park are keeping around-the-clock vigil over the egg, the first produced by captiveCalifornia condors under a program started 15 years ago to save thenearly extinct species, spokesman Tom Hanscom said.   The chick should win its struggle to break out of the theblue-green shell within the next three days, he said. It beganusing its lungs for the first time Sunday when it pushed its beakinto an air pocket at the egg's narrow end.   The chipping of a small hole in the shell, or pipping, begins acritical phase in the bird's development, Hanscom said.   ``We have a remote TV camera on the egg, monitoring itconstantly,'' Hanscom said. ``And every hour the egg is physicallytapped by a keeper to provide the same outside stimulation onemight expect from a natural mother in the nest.''   If the chick fails to hatch itself by Saturday morning, keepersand veterinarians will step in and help it get out, Hansom said.The chick will be hand-raised by keepers using a puppet resemblingan adult condor for feeding.   The chick is especially susceptible to infection and exhaustionnow that it has broken through the eggshell, Hanscom said.   The California condor, North America's largest land bird with awing span of up to 10 feet, once ranged along the Pacific coastfrom Canada to Mexico.   Only 27 California condors are known to exist today, all incaptivity at the wild animal park and the Los Angeles Zoo, the lastwild bird having been captured last year.   The fertile egg, laid March 3, was the culmination of anelaborate courtship dance and mating of a young male designated AC4and his older mate, UN1. The egg was removed from the park's``condorminium'' and placed in an incubator.   Exhaustion from trying to break the shell could kill the chick,but keepers must allow 72 hours to pass before intervening, Hanscomsaid. If they step in too early, they could cause the chick tobleed to death by rupturing a membrane of blood cells that thecondor needs to absorb, he said.   ``We don't want to be pessimistic, but we are very anxious atthis time,'' Hanscom said.   Thirteen of 14 condor eggs taken from nests in the wild havehatched in captivity, all with human assistance, he said.   The chick's parents have continued to mate, raising hopes for asecond egg. At the Los Angeles Zoo, two other potential matingpairs have failed to begin the courtship dance.   Hanscom said the pairs may not have adjusted to captivity or maybe incompatible.   ``These birds mate for life and here we are chosing matesartificially for them,'' he said. ``That might not always take. Thebirds may not always decide to follow our magic making.''   Scientists sought to begin the condor capture-breeding programduring the 1950s but were delayed by opposition by the NationalAudubon Society and others.   The opponents eventually were pacified by assurances that thecondors' natural habitat would be protected and that a wildpopulation eventually would be re-established.   Federal and state agencies have joined the multimillion-dollareffort to regenerate the birds.   The success of the program won't be known for years, as theoldest bird hatched in captivity is 5 years old and condors reachmaturity at age 7, Hanscom said.   The egg's parents were taken from the wild, and the male onlyreached maturity last summer. But Hanscom is convinced condors bornin captivity also will produce eggs such as the one now watchedintently.   ``The chick that hatches from this egg represents theregeneration of this species,'' he said. ``Captive breeding istheir only hope for survival.''</TEXT></DOC>
