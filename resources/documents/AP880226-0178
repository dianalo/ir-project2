KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congressional foes of Panamanian strongmanManuel Antonio Noriega urged the Reagan administration on Friday toimpose an immediate and total trade embargo to force him from power.   Some said the administration should not rule out _ at least asan option _ the use of military force to oust Noriega, the generalwho heads Panama's defense forces.   Noriega was indicted in the United States recently on charges oftaking millions of dolllars to turn Panama into a haven for drugsand the profits they generate.   Others said the United States should press the issue at theOrganization for American States and seek the widest possibleconsensus in the Western Hemisphere for Noriega's removal and forthe restoration of democracy in Panama.   But Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia saidthe United States needs to ``keep cool''as it reviews its optionsin dealing with Noreiga, especially in light of the continuing U.S.need to protect free passage through the Panama Canal.   There was almost universal rejection on Capitol Hill ofNoriega's claim that the United States is attempting to usecorruption charges against him to renege on the U.S. committment toturn the canal over to Panama by the year 2000.   ``That statement by Gen. Noriega is piffle, pap, and politicalflim flam intended to preserve his own interests,'' Byrd toldreporters.   ``That is an absolute and total and complete fabrication,'' saidSen. David Boren, D-Okla. ``... It's the old trick of when you getcaught with your hand in the till, of trying to raise some redherring to draw attention from yourself ...''   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said he spoke to PanamanianPresident Eric Arturo Delvalle by telephone at midday on Friday.   ``He said to me he would be fully supportive of a tradeembargo,'' D'Amato told reporters. ``That would be the kind ofdecisive action the United States should follow through on.''   D'Amato said that while he does not believe the United Statesshould now intervene militarily, ``we should not preclude militaryaction if that is necessary to protect the vital interests of theUnited States.''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the United States shouldpress the Organization of American States (OAS) to accept thecredentials of a new ambassador sent by Devalle and cancel thecredentials of Noriega's ambassador.   He said that would make clear where the democracies of thehemisphere stand on the matter.   ``The action that the OAS takes will speak volumes about whetherthat is a meaningful organization or whether it should not be takenseriously,'' Kennedy said.   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who heads a Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee investigation into Noriega's alleged links to narcoticsracketeering and money laundering, said the United States shouldconsider suspending landing rights for Panamanaian aircraft andstop the export of U.S. technology to that country.   But he said that because Panama uses U.S. currency as legaltender, the most telling step would be to suspend the transfer ofU.S. dollars to and from Panama.   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the Senate's deputy GOP leader,called for a bipartisan movement to deal ``with a squirrel likeNoriega who's got his mailed fist on the levers of the locks of thecanal.''   ``I think you will find Noriega will leave once the UnitedStates makes a flat-footed stand,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,a leading critic both of Noriega and of the treaties which call forthe canal to be turned over to Panama in the year 2000.   ``Just embargo Panama,'' Helms said.</TEXT></DOC>
