We asked Symantec presidentGordon Eubanks for his thoughts on this question:andM;Both Symantec and Central Point offer very feature-rich collections Of DOSutilities, and you often compete head-to-head for the same customers.andP;  Whattips the scales? &quot;What drives people to buy a utility collection is usuallyone important feature.andP;  In the case of DOS utilities, the essential featurehas always been data recovery.andP;  We think we really do have great technologyin the recovery area.andP;  The other features--disk optimization, encryption, theDOS shell--don't matter as much, and there aren't big differences in theseareas between our products and the competition.&quot;andM;Traditionally, utility customers tend to buy one copy for their whole office,which they rarely use except in an emargency.andP;  Is this pattern changing?andM;We're trying to move our products from power user tools to something thatbenefits the average user all the time.andP;  Our goal is to get the software onevery machine, just like a word processor.andP;  We'll continue to addfunctionality that brings us in that direction.&quot;andM;Does that mean you just evolve your products by adding features, or is therea &quot;The features we add absolutely have to make sense as part of a whole.andO;People really don't want you to bundle a word processor or a spreadsheet witha collection of disk utilities--they just don't fit together conceptually.andO;We're also very careful to make the interface consistent.andP;  we've paid a lotof attention to interface design in the products we've acquired.&quot;andM;Now that big companies are beginning to dominate the utilities market, isthere much room left for developers of specialized utilities?andM;It's a hard market now.andP;  You're going to have to have incredible technologyto survive.andP;  The people who are really at risk are the ones whose productsaren't much more than good ideas that are easy to copy.andP;  Sooner or later,those good ideas are going to become features in somebody else's product.&quot;andM;Gordon Eubanks, president, Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino,calif.andP;  95014; 408/253-9600.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
