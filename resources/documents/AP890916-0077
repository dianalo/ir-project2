(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Oral Roberts had a dream aftertalking to God in the desert: a hospital complex where Christianscould receive medical treatment and bedside prayer. But now he'sshutting it down.   ``However spiritual one is, you cannot do anything withoutmoney,'' he said last week.   But the cutbacks could save the 4,300-student Oral RobertsUniversity and other components of his ministry.   Roberts had raised the money to pay for his 400-acre religiousempire in cash. He built the $150 million City of Faith medicalcomplex without a mortgage, funded $8 million in medical schoolscholarships for two years, and paid $11 million in past-dueaccounts earlier this year.   At its height, the south Tulsa ministry he founded 25 years agowas a $500 million operation.   But donations from the faithful have fallen with each nationalheadline about wayward preachers, Roberts said. Since the 1987scandals of Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker, Roberts' ministry hasseen a drop in monthly donations from $5 million to just over $2million.   ``I don't know why it's happened,'' Roberts said. ``I guess lifejust seems to be what it is.''   It was the first time in Roberts' 41-year evangelical career thathe publicly acknowledged that expecting a miracle, the theme of hisministry, is not always enough.   The 71-year-old faith-healer said he received his vision aboutthe medical complex during a 1977 conversation with God in aCalifornia desert, and was assured three years later by a 900-footJesus that his dream soon would come true.   Last week, the minister who earned his reputation as a travelingtent preacher offering salvation and healing gave up part of thatdream. He said he was closing his City of Faith hospital and the147-student medical school, and selling his home _ valued at$500,000 in 1987 _ and other ministry-owned property to pay off $25million in debts.   ``It was a tremendous undertaking,'' Roberts conceded. ``Medicaleducation is far different from any other form of education I'veever been associated with.''   But Roberts does not see it as a failure.   ``I don't think it's as bad a day as it seems. I think we'll lookback on this and think it's the right thing,'' he said.   In fact, Roberts seemed almost relieved as he told reportersabout his plans to prune his ministry.   ``Looking back now that it's made, I think it's one of the bestdecisions I've ever made.''   Roberts and those who have followed the ministry agree that thecutbacks could work for the better.   ``The steps that he is taking to stop the flow of money at histwo most expensive points of loss _ the hospital and medical school_ will strengthen financially the university and the ministry,''Tulsa Mayor Rodger Randle said. ``We have a short-term loss, but astrengthened ability to survive in the long term.''   The medical school has been a source of many financial problemsfor the ministry. In 1987, Roberts' said he had to raise $8 millionfor it or God would ``call me home.''   The hospital, which tapped $24 million from the ministry'scoffers in its first year of operation in 1981, only recently begancovering its own expenses. Roberts built the hospital with a 777-bedcapacity, but state regulators approved only 294 beds, and thehighest average occupancy was 148 in 1984.   ``I have reason to believe that that hospital itself was notdoing that poorly,'' said James Stansbarger, president of the TulsaHospital Council. ``One of that hospital's main purposes was to helpthat medical school. You have to make your choices. His choices werethe school's going, so the hospital's going too.''   Roberts said he had no choice but to take immediate action.   ``We've got to take the religious blinders off our eyes and endour holier-than-thou attitude and realize that we live in a humanworld and that it takes money to survive,'' Roberts told students,faculty and staff Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
