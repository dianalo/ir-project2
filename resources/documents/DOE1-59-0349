We show that the strength of the 9.7 {mu}msilicate dust feature is directly proportional to the mass loss rate(so long as the feature remains optically thin), indicating that thedust-to-gas ratio is approximately constant for oxygen-rich stars. Thesilicate dust feature thus provides a method of measuring mass loss ratesfor oxygen-rich red giants and supergiants, which are too distant tobe detected in CO.</TEXT></DOC>
