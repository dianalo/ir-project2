The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleged there were 313 violations at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo., primary lead smelter, including 283 alleged willful violations. The agency considers any violation willful if the employer knew about workplace health or safety conditions that don't meet government requirements, or was aware of a hazardous condition but didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it.    OSHA cited Doe Run for 177 health violations, mainly involving exposure to lead, and 136 instances of failing to record occupational injuries, including lacerations, fractures, burns and eye injuries.    The proposed penalties are among the largest OSHA has sought against any employer. The agency is also seeking back pay and benefits for certain contract workers who OSHA said were overexposed to lead and replaced by new workers. St. Joe Minerals, Clayton, Mo., is a unit of Fluor Corp., Irvine, Calif., and Homestake Mining is based in San Francisco.    &quot;Doe Run's continuing disregard for complying with the spirit and the letter of the OSHA lead standard and for guarding the health of its work force is unacceptable,&quot; said Frank White, deputy assistant secretary of labor and OSHA's enforcement chief.    The joint venture, in a prepared release, said it would &quot;move quickly to correct any situation that could threaten worker health or safety&quot; at the smelter. But Doe Run added that it considers many of OSHA's charges &quot;unwarranted,&quot; and denied disregarding either the spirit or letter of the OSHA law. It called most of the cases &quot;paperwork violations,&quot; and said others &quot;involve legitimate differences of opinion over highly technical matters.&quot;    Doe Run said that &quot;our record on worker health and safety is outstanding, and we intend to keep it that way.&quot; A Homestake official said that &quot;we stand behind&quot; the Doe Run statement. A spokesman for Fluor declined to comment beyond the Doe Run release.    OSHA said that Doe Run violated part of nearly every section of its lead standard, including provisions governing lead-exposure monitoring, engineering controls, biological monitoring, medical monitoring, hygiene facilities, removal of employees from hazardous work for medical reasons and respirator protection.    The agency said Doe Run rotated contract employees in and out of high-lead areas to minimize levels of lead in their blood, replacing workers when their levels rose above OSHA-set maximums. OSHA said this policy failed to meet its requirement that employees with excessive amounts of lead in their blood be removed from high-lead areas and guaranteed their pay and benefits for up to 18 months while their blood-lead levels return to normal.    The company can appeal the proposed penalties to an independent commission within 15 days. </TEXT></DOC>
