The rebound, said to have been sparked by speculativepurchases and helped by increased Middle East tensions,turned some technical charts positive and gave the dollar abrighter short-term outlook.</LP><TEXT>   Even so, the rebound wasn't powerful enough to snap thedollar out of its downtrend, foreign exchange dealers said.   The bullish effect of the United Nations standoff againstIraq isn't expected to last. The U.N. set a deadline for Iraqto release United Nations weapons inspectors held since earlyTuesday. The U.N. didn't say what it would do if Iraq failsto comply.   But traders predicted that even a military strike on Iraqwould only carry the dollar to 1.7200 marks. And many playerswould sell dollars into that rise.   &quot;I don't think it would go that much higher,&quot; said DavidGilmore, senior currency analyst at MCM CurrencyWatch in NewYork. After the sudden reversal following the bungled Sovietcoup, people are &quot;shy of buying {on} political uncertainty,&quot;he said.   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6870 marks,up from 1.6730 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S.currency also was changing hands at 133.50 yen, up from132.84 yen. Sterling fetched $1.7285, down from $1.7425.   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quotedat 133.45 yen, up from Tuesday's close of 132.97 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6855 marks, upfrom 1.6728 marks.   Traders expect the dollar to remain between 1.6700 marksand 1.6900 marks today. The U.S. currency, which hit aseven-month low against its Japanese counterpart Monday, alsois likely to remain between 132.50 yen and 133.80 yen.   The picture could change if data on U.S. durable goodsorders for August deviate substantially from expectations.   Orders for big-ticket items are expected to have fallen4.8% in August, compared with a record gain of 11.2% in July.   The dollar skidded to 1.6665 marks early in the day afterthe Conference Board's U.S. consumer confidence index showedits third straight monthly decline.   U.S. auto sales rose to a 6.4-million unit annual rate inmid-September from a 5.4million rate for the first 10 days ofthe month. That was above the 5.9-million rate economists hadpredicted, but well below the 7.8-million rate reported formid-September last year.   Sales drops of 22.6% at Ford Motor Co. and 24.1% atGeneral Motors Corp. caught the market's attention early inthe day, prompting traders to sell dollars before the end ofEuropean trading, according to Charles Spence, corporateforeign exchange manager at First Interstate Bank ofCalifornia in Los Angeles.   After the London market closed, traders renewed theirselling and succeeded in punching the dollar through itsearlier support level. It fell swiftly to 1.6630 marks, itsintraday low. At that point, &quot;a massive buyer came in andpanicked everybody the other way,&quot; said Steven Oser, acorporate adviser at Midland Bank PLC. Traders said the buyerwas a Swiss investment fund but that couldn't be confirmed.   Later, the dollar rose on news that the president of theU.N. Security Council had set a deadline for Iraq to releaseweapons inspectors detained earlier.   There also was some buying of dollars on speculation thatthe currency would trade higher today, but positions weresmall and activity light.   J. Adam Hewison, a currency analyst at Rich FinancialGroup in Shady Side, Md., said trading likely will be subduedtoday because dealers suffered losses in yesterday's suddenreversal.   Traders believe the dollar will head lower in the next fewweeks, with the near-term objective being 1.6500 marks. Butthat &quot;holy grail&quot; might have to wait, said Midland Bank's Mr.Oser.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $353.70 an ounce, up $2.90. Estimatedvolume was a moderate 2.9 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Wednesday, gold was quoted at $354 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
