<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-45-0329 </DOCNO><TEXT>A clinical case of dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA) was reported.We established several aspects on the basis of MRI findings and a neuro-otologicalstudy. A 47-year-old woman had gait disturbance, involuntary movements,speech disturbance, and memory disturbance at the age of 42. She wasadmitted to the hospital because of worsening of the gait disturbance.Neurological examinations showed choreo-athetosis of the face, neck andupper extremities, mental disturbance, and scanning speech. However,she had neither ocular disturbance nor epilepsy or myoclonus. On theMRI-CT, an atrophy of midbrain and pontine tegmentum was observed. Theneuro-otological study showed gaze nystagmus at the horizontal gaze,rebound nystagmus, hypometria of the saccade, saccadic pursuit, reductionof the optokinetic nystagmus, and increase in caloric nystagmus by meansof visual input. A severe atrophy of the brainstem tegmentum and a mildatrophy of the cerebellar hemisphere and cerebral cortex are regardedas neuro-radiological features of DRPLA. Moreover, tegmental atrophyis related to ocular disturbance as a clinical feature. Various neuro-otologicalfindings reveal many systems of ocular movements, i.e., a smooth pursuitsystem, a saccade system, and a vestibulo-ocular reflex system, involvingflocculus. DRPLA can be clinically diagnosed by means of clinical features,MRI findings, and neuro-otological findings. A variety of neuro-otologicalabnormalities may indicate a progression of the ocular disturbance anda variety of lesions.</TEXT></DOC>
