Project inputsrepresent the costs of the project, while project outputs are its benefits.Costs are measured as the opportunity costs: since economic resourcesare limited, the undertaking of an investment diverts resources fromalternative uses. Market prices do not always reflect opportunity costs.This is relevant in our case for the raw material itself, biomass, whichis seldom marketed. Another viable approach is to consider the productioncosts of biomass. One possible solution is to consider the opportunitycost of producing the same amount of energy in an alternative plant aftercomparing the calorific power of biogas (or biomass) with conventionalfuels. Further benefits, such as the social value of waste disposal orthe use of by-products as fertilizers, may be introduced after carefuldiscussion and net of associated costs. The economic feasibility of biomassenergy production projects is conditioned by financial constraints, whichhave effect on the ''willingness to pay'' of project beneficiaries: wewill consider, with reference to Italy, the influence of market regulations,of purchase prices of excess electricity, of the legislation in favorof integrative energy sources.</TEXT></DOC>
