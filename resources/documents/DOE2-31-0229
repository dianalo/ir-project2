The ATEOSproject was a cooperative study conducted for the state of New Jerseyto establish quantitative information relating to human exposure to toxicair pollutants. The book is a compilation of six chapters written bythe individual participating researchers about their respective portionsof the study, accompanied by an introductory study design chapter andfinal overview chapter. While the format varies somewhat from chapterto chapter (e.g., some provide a chapter summary at the end, others donot), the text is generally well written and provides the reader withan awareness of what was planned, what was accomplished, what the resultsimply, and (to some extent) what might be done differently in futurestudies. As such, this book provides a useful primer on executing sucha study, while also documenting the scientific accomplishments of theATEOS project.</TEXT></DOC>
