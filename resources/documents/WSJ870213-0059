Stock traders cautioned that the government hasn't yet won convictions on its latest cases. But both lawmakers and stock-market professionals said yesterday's arrests send a clear signal: An overhaul of takeover and securities practices has become increasingly likely.    &quot;We were moving toward legislative action anyhow,&quot; said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio.), referring to last November's insider-trading case against investor Ivan Boesky. &quot;Every additional case just adds to the sense of urgency.&quot; He added that &quot;Wall Street's image is suffering from greenmail, poison pills and insider trading. It makes people wonder if the average shareholder is getting a fair shake.&quot;    Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said through a spokesman that the latest arrests &quot;underscore the urgent need for a thorough congressional examination and overhaul of . . . the corporate takeover game.&quot; His main objective is to curtail what he calls &quot;manipulative takeover activity&quot; by those who &quot;put a company into play&quot; merely to profit from the resulting run-up in the stock price. Sen. Proxmire will hold hearings on takeover excesses March 4 and in April and then seek a political consensus for revamping the takeover process.    Even on Wall Street, executives appeared willing to accept some change. &quot;The rules are adequate, but they may require some honing,&quot; said George Ball, chief executive officer of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Mr. Ball already has proposed a new definition of insider trading, and he voiced support for quicker disclosure of 5% stockholdings, as well as curbs on &quot;preferential relationships&quot; among a few big investors.    Meanwhile, the multibillion-dollar takeover arbitrage business may shrink further, in light of the government's widening insider-trading case. While arbitrage has been a hugely profitable area for big securities firms, officials have expressed concern about how to supervise it. Earlier this month, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. cut back its arbitrage unit and placed it under tighter supervision.    Citicorp, which created an arbitrage unit last year, said: &quot;If we had a chance to choose again to start this business, this mightn't be the time.&quot;    A veteran independent arbitrager added: &quot;People are worried about who's next&quot; to face federal charges. At a news conference yesterday in New York, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani indicated that the investigation extends well beyond what has been announced.    Even so, big investors seemed largely unfazed by yesterday's arrests, beyond some mild indignation about market abuses. &quot;I've always assumed that some other people may have inside information,&quot; said Dean LeBaron, head of Batterymarch Financial Management Corp. &quot;It isn't as level a playing field as one might like.&quot;    In Washington, however, Michigan Democrat John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called yesterday's arrests &quot;evidence of spreading contagion&quot; on Wall Street. He said his panel will introduce legislation soon to counter certain takeover abuses such as greenmail, in which companies buy out unwanted suitors at a premium to the share price.    In addition to federal legislation being discussed, revisions are seen coming in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules.    Rep. Dingell said his committee's bill also will seek to shorten the 10-day period before investors must disclose holdings of 5% or more in a company. That &quot;10-day window&quot; has often allowed hostile bidders to raise their stake well above 5% before making any announcement. It also has allowed rumors to build about raiders stalking companies, before investors can know whether any filings have been made.    Wall Street professionals generally welcome faster disclosure of 5% positions. &quot;Those laws were written when it wasn't possible to buy a big block of stock so quickly,&quot; said Prudential-Bache's Mr. Ball. &quot;In 1990 it will probably be possible to buy 10 million shares of a stock in a day, and our disclosure policy should reflect that.&quot;    Mr. Ball also renewed his call for a clearer definition of insider trading. Last June, he suggested at a House hearing that it should be illegal to trade on any information that is apt to have a material effect on the price of a security if the information isn't available to a &quot;discerning investor.&quot;    On the other hand, Wall Street observers noted, opponents of curbs on arbitrage or takeovers are likely to argue that federal investigators' rigorous prosecution of the three men suggests that strong enforcement of existing laws is a more effective remedy for abuses than new legislation.    Mr. Dingell said he will &quot;look at things to be done in the area of insider trading,&quot; he said. One possible way to promote deterrence would be to toughen the criminal penalties under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act.    In addition, Mr. Dingell said he intends to look into whether the SEC has sufficient power &quot;to produce the necessary cooperation&quot; from prospective witnesses and defendants.    At the coming hearings, SEC officials will be questioned about the adequacy of the SEC's budget and enforcement powers and will be asked for their views on takeover regulation. SEC insiders said the agency is very likely to recommend closing the 10-day window, just as it did early last year.    Yesterday, SEC Chairman John Shad said that the SEC is taking &quot;another look&quot; at curbing greenmail in light of a recent spate of greenmail payments to raiders. The agency, he said, is also considering whether so-called unconventional tender offers, such as open-market purchases of stock after the termination of a tender offer, should be brought under the disclosure and other investor-protection provisions of the Williams Act, which governs tender offers.    But for a settlement, the SEC would have filed objections last October to Campeau Corp.'s $1.7 billion purchase of Allied Stores Corp. stock on the open market immediately after Campeau called off its bid for control of Allied. The SEC was prepared to contend that the purchases amounted to a &quot;de facto continuation&quot; of the terminated bid and violated the Williams Act.    &quot;We are studying whether there ought to be a cooling-off period before you can sweep the street and whether any substantial purchases should be in the form of a Willliams Act tender offer,&quot; Mr. Shad said.    He maintained that the insider-trading scandal shouldn't be the impetus for takeover legislation, since insider trading is &quot;parasitical activity,&quot; not the &quot;driving force&quot; behind takeovers.    Mr. Shad indicated that he believes the proposed 32% budget increase -- to a record $145 million -- for the next fiscal year should be sufficient for the agency to meet its growing regulatory challenges. &quot;Sure we could do more with more,&quot; he said, but with every &quot;incremental increase&quot; there are diminishing returns.    &quot;We try to conduct our activities on a cost-effective basis,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
