This paper seeks to trace the historical evolution ofthese weapons, with specific emphasis upon the enhanced radiation (ER)family of tactical nuclear arms. This approach is useful because so littleis actually known about ER weapons as compared to their conventional-nuclear-weaponscounterparts. Discussions address the capabilities and characteristicsof nuclear and ER Weapons with an associated analysis of the Soviet-WarsawPact threat that currently faces NATO and western Europe. It was thisspecific threat that proved to be the driving force that initially promptedthe US to develop a tactical ER nuclear capability. The paper also addressesthe current array of US tactical nuclear weapons, with emphasis uponspecific systems and NATO stockpile data. Finally, an analysis of employingthis weapon is explored with respect to current Army nuclear weaponsdoctrine, systems capability, and enemy threat. This culminating discussiondemonstrates that it has been, and continues to be, in our best interestto retain the present strategy option of preemptive use of enhanced radiationand tactical nuclear weapons should the NATO battlefield commander befaced with no other alternative to avoid defeat.</TEXT></DOC>
