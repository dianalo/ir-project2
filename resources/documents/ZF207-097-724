Xinu officals said.andM;Mach's virtual memory is divided in two parts:  an invariant,machine-independent portion; and a small, machine-dependent portion thathandled specific memory-address translation.andP;  The product can manage largeamounts of memory interacting on the network.andP;  Mach-based workstations canaddress 4GB of virtual memory.andM;The 1990 version of Mach will incorporate a variety of technologies--such asthe Andrew user environment (jointly developed by IBM and CMU), the X WindowSystem, and the Camelot distributed transaction processing system developedby CMU, according to Mt xinu officials.andM;It will also support the 4.3BSD Unix interfaces and the Posix standard.andM;&quot;From a user point of view, the most exciting stuff is not so much Machitself but the Andrew user environment, X, and fairly new facilities, such asmultimedia,&quot; Gould said.andP;  &quot;There are all kinds of things that are new thatare being put together so that people can use them.&quot;andM;Future &quot;releases will take a modular approach to system extensions, so thatthe Mach kernel will provide only a small set of primitive functions; morecomplex functions will be implemented outside the kernel as objects to whichmessages are passed, company officials said.andM;For additional information, Mt Xinu can be contacted at 2560 9th St.,andO;Berkeley, CA 94, 10, (415)644-0146.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
