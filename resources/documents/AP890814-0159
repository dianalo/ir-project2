Prosecutors took the action, which clears Dotson of any legalwrongdoing in the case, immediately after a defense motion for a newtrial was granted by Circuit Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald.   Attorney Thomas Breen, saying high-tech genetic tests proveDotson's innocence, had asked Fitzgerald for a new trial.   ``The only conclusion that can be drawn is that Gary Dotson wasconvicted of a crime that never took place,'' Breen said outside thecourtroom.   Prosecutors had contended that the test results were not enoughto clear Dotson, and that a new trial couldn't be granted unless itwas likely to reverse the outcome of the first one.   ``I have my bitterness, yes. It's been hard to deal with,'' saidDotson, convicted of rape and aggravated kidnapping in 1979 andsentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison for a 1977 attack on CathleenCrowell Webb.   Six years later, Mrs. Webb recanted her testimony, a move thatled to clemency for Dotson.   ``I forgave her a long time ago. I've no animosity against her,''Dotson said.   ``I'm sure she's very relieved that it's done,'' the Rev. CarlNannini, a Dublin, N.H., Baptist minister who acts as Mrs. Webb'sspokesman, said in an interview.   Although Nannini said Mrs. Webb had not known about Monday'saction when he talked to her earlier in the day, the minister saidMrs. Webb has contacts in Chicago who have kept her current ondevelopments in the case.   Breen contended that genetic test results prove that semen foundon the underpants worn by Mrs. Webb on the night she said she wasraped in July 1977 did not come from Dotson.   In August 1988, Edward Blake of Forensic Science Associates inRichmond, Calif., examined the underwear and concluded Dotsoncouldn't have been among the 5 percent of men whose genetic patternmatched cells found in the stain _ a finding supported by a Britishexpert at the University of Leicester.   The stain was a key piece of evidence in the prosecution's case.   When she recanted her testimony in 1985, Mrs. Webb _ now aHarrisville, N.H., homemaker _ said she invented the attack becauseshe feared she had become pregnant by her boyfriend.   Gov. James R. Thompson granted Dotson clemency that year, sayinghis punishment had been sufficient. But the governor has refused topardon Dotson, saying he did not believe Mrs. Webb's reversal.   When Thompson heard the court news Monday, he ``was happy thatthe whole thing is over,'' said David Fields, a spokesman for thegovernor.   ``He was frustrated that he gave Mr. Dotson repeatedopportunities and something always happened,'' Fields said.   Dotson, 32, who has married and become a father since hisrelease, was paroled last August after recurring minor problems withthe law returned him to prison. He has been living in an alcohol anddrug treatment center under terms of his parole.</TEXT></DOC>
