Holographic interferogramsreveal radial density profiles of the vortex at different stages of itsdevelopment during convection. A general mathematical expression is foundthat closely describes the distribution of density inside the vortex.By use of experimental data and the governing equations in an empirical/theoreticalanalysis, an extended physical description of the vortex is developed.The time behavior of the density, determined from the experiments, allowsthe solution of the Continuity Equation, and a distribution of the radialcomponent of fluid velocity relative to the vortex center is obtained.The density information, supplemented by an independent determinationof pressure is then used in the Radial Momentum Equation to obtain adistribution of the circumferential component of fluid velocity relativeto the vortex center, thus completing the description of the radial dependenceof the velocities inside the vortex. Furthermore, the calculated velocitiesare used to evaluate the magnitudes of the convective and diffusive termsof the Angular Momentum Equation, thus providing insight into the questionof the relative effects of compressibility and viscosity.</TEXT></DOC>
