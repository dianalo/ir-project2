Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   Three Democratic candidates were bunched together in their party's caucuses in Iowa, with Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri apparently the narrow victor.    With most of the precincts reporting, Mr. Gephardt had almost 30% of the vote for delegates, only a few percentage points ahead of Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who, in turn, narrowly led Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.    The man who was running first in Iowa public-opinion polls as recently as six weeks ago, former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, finished a dismal seventh, garnering less than 1% of the vote and trailing &quot;uncommitted.&quot; Mr. Hart dropped out of the presidential race for seven months last year after published reports of his relationship with Miami model Donna Rice.    Iowa probably sounded the death knell for Mr. Hart's campaign. This, after all, was the state that launched Mr. Hart four years ago, when he finished a distant second in these caucuses to former Vice President Walter Mondale and then surged on to win the New Hampshire primary.    The three leaders -- Messrs. Gephardt, Simon and Dukakis -- move on to New Hampshire in lock step. Mr. Dukakis will no doubt remain the favorite because, as governor of neighboring Massachusetts, he is a household word in the Granite State. But all three men are in the running.    Mr. Gephardt may be hurt a bit by the big news on the GOP side -- Pat Robertson's strong showing that may blot out the coverage Mr. Gephardt might otherwise have expected to receive as the Democratic winner.    The Rev. Jesse Jackson pulled nearly 10% of the vote, while former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt had less than 7%.    Still waiting to make his move is Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, who has chosen to compete initially in his native South. Presumably, he has been helped by the failure of any of his rivals to move smartly into the lead as a result of the Iowa vote.    No clear leader emerged on the Democratic side until the campaign's final days, when polls showed Mr. Gephardt breaking ahead of the pack. He laid siege to Iowa, campaigning here for two years on a populist, anti-establishment platform that called for heavy penalties against foreign nations that put up barriers to U.S. products.    Sen. Simon, an avuncular figure in his trademark bow ties, ran well. He worked hard to portray himself as a modern-day Harry Truman or Hubert Humphrey, while at the same time trumpeting his support for a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets.    Gov. Dukakis, meanwhile, had run on the theme of the &quot;Massachusetts miracle&quot; -- the economic turnaround that has occurred during his years in office.    Mr. Jackson aimed his campaign at Iowa's distressed farmers and factory workers, victims of bad times in Iowa's economic downturn. Winner of the conviviality award was Mr. Babbitt, who attracted a loyal and dedicated following. They admired his honesty and humor.    Iowa Democrats will send 58 delegates to the national convention. The process of choosing those delegates began yesterday night.
