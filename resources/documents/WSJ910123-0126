Now that we've found thenational resolve to &quot;provide for the common defense,&quot; as thePreamble to the Constitution puts it, maybe law-enforcementauthorities can again do what it takes to &quot;insure domestictranquility.&quot;   There is a good argument that the collapse of will inVietnam was not confined to military activities, and so thereis reason to hope that renewed self-confidence abroad willmean a change of direction at home. A similar equivocationexplains how we lost control of the streets. Recall how thedomestic-policy elite of judges and lawyers in the 1960sbegan to second-guess all manner of police activities. Theburdens now include Miranda and other exclusionary rules,abolition of anti-loitering laws as too vague and token or nojail time even for repeat criminals.</LP><TEXT>   Consider the career of a typical beneficiary of thecurrent system. Brian Lawrence, 30 years old, is aprofessional mugger who spent years working the New York Citysubway, according to criminal records in the table nearby. Hewas anonymous until Jan. 8, when his purse-snatching turnedinto a killing.   Grace Cheng, a young waitress who had emigrated from HongKong, was in a subway car one morning as it pulled out of the96th Street station. According to police, Lawrence grabbedher pocketbook and she ended up in the gap between the subwaycar and the platform. The train dragged her along theplatform, nearly severing her left leg, and breaking her hipand arm. She died after five hours of surgery.   &quot;I can't believe it,&quot; Lawrence told the police when he wasarrested outside the station. &quot;I'm in all this trouble foronly a $1 bill.&quot; This is all she had in her purse.   His disbelief was not entirely unjustified. He was stillon the streets after 18 arrests and 11 convictions in NewYork and Florida. His career began with four arrests in thetwo weeks between Nov. 18 and Dec. 2, 1979. It was typicalthat the first three burglary charges resulted in twodismissed cases and one &quot;conditional discharge,&quot; meaning hemight be punished for a later crime. He spent part of 1980 inJacksonville, Fla., where he was briefly jailed for prowlingand burglary.   He returned to New York, where police records disclosethat he worked the subway cars between stops in Harlem andthe South Bronx. For those whose immediate answer to crime isto register guns, it's worth noting that Lawrence never useda weapon. In 1985, he attacked a 68-year-old woman for herpocketbook. He &quot;stamped her foot, punched her in the stomachand took said purse from her person,&quot; according to a courtreport. After subway riders held him for police, he confessedthat he &quot;had done between 2,500 and one million pursesnatches.&quot; He was released after serving five years ofcombined five-to-10 plus two-to-four-year sentences -- intime allegedly to commit felony murder in the course ofrobbing Grace Cheng.   &quot;To an outsider, five to 10 might not sound like much,&quot; aTransit Authority spokesman said, &quot;but in this town it'ssubstantial.&quot; Or as another law-enforcement official put it,&quot;In New York, this is no John Dillinger.&quot; This attitude isunderstandable, though Dillingers or not, fewer than one in100 arrests in New York results in jail sentences. What ifjudges simply locked away career criminals until they weretoo old to strike again?   Solutions to the crime problem are easier to find than thewill to enforce them. Robert Morgenthau, the districtattorney in Manhattan whose office will try Lawrence onmurder charges, agrees that an end of the Vietnam syndromemight help. &quot;At this point we're closer to anarchy than torespect for the law,&quot; he said. He noted that about 5% of thecriminals commit one-quarter of the felonies. &quot;We need to putour resources into more aggressively pursuing the highlyactive criminals,&quot; he said. The transit police cover thesubways, where a surprisingly low 3% of New York crimesoccur. Even so, transit officials have amassed a most wantedlist of 1,000 sub way criminals.   Mr. Morgenthau says another part of the problem is thestill-expanding exclusionary rule to suppress evidence fromjuries. &quot;In New York, the courts have decided that the stateconstitution is broader than the U.S. Constitution,&quot; he said.&quot;We have cops on the street making split-second decisionsthat judges later overrule,&quot; he said, offering an examplebased on real cases. &quot;If someone calls up and says there'ssomeone in a red shirt in a bar with a gun and it turns outto be true, it's absurd to say the case must be dismissedbecause there was no probable cause. The proof was in thepudding.&quot;   The American will to fight in Iraq could haveunforeseeable consequences, perhaps including a rediscoveredwill to fight back at home as well. We have learned aftermany years of judicial experimentation that keeping the peaceagainst domestic criminals will also require a steady andhard hand.   ---                 Rap Sheet of a Subway Mugger                                                                                                        DATE                   Nov. 18, 1979 CHARGE                 Burglary, 2d degree PLEA                   Burglary, 3d degree SENTENCE               Case dismissed                                                                                                        DATE                   Nov. 21, 1979 PLACE                  Bronx CHARGE                 Attempted burglary, 3d degree PLEA                   Attempted criminal trespass SENTENCE               Conditional discharge                                                                                                        DATE                   Nov. 23, 1979 PLACE                  Bronx CHARGE                 Attempted burglary, 3d degree PLEA                   None SENTENCE               Case dismissed                                                                                                        DATE                   Dec. 2, 1979 PLACE                  Brooklyn CHARGE                 Grand larceny, 3d degree PLEA                   Attempted grand larceny, 3d degree SENTENCE               5 months                                                                                                        DATE                   Oct. 16, 1981 PLACE                  Bronx CHARGE                 Robbery, 2d degree PLEA                   Petty larceny SENTENCE               Conditional discharge                                                                                                        DATE                   Aug. 26, 1982 PLACE                  Manhattan CHARGE                 Theft of services PLEA                   Theft of services SENTENCE               Conditional discharge                                                                                                        DATE                   Oct. 3, 1982 PLACE                  Bronx CHARGE                 Burglary, 3d degree PLEA                   Not available SENTENCE               Not available                                                                                                        DATE                   March 31, 1983 PLACE                  Bronx CHARGE                 Misdemeanor assault PLEA                   Attempted misdemeanor assault SENTENCE               90 days                                                                                                        DATE                   July 9, 1983 PLACE                  Bronx CHARGE                 Grand larceny PLEA                   Theft of services SENTENCE               4 months                                                                                                        DATE                   Dec. 10, 1983 PLACE                  Bronx CHARGE                 Theft of services PLEA                   Theft of services                                                                                                        DATE                   Jan. 5, 1984 PLACE                  Bronx CHARGE                 Grand larceny PLEA                   Petty larceny SENTENCE               6 months                                                                                                        DATE                   July 20, 1984 PLACE                  Manhattan CHARGE                 Grand larceny PLEA                   Grand larceny SENTENCE               9 months                                                                                                        DATE                   June 27, 1985 PLACE                  Manhattan CHARGE                 Robberies, 2d and 3d degrees PLEA                   Robberies, 2d and 3d degrees SENTENCE               5-10 years                                                                                                        DATE                   July 26, 1985 PLACE                  Bronx CHARGE                 Robbery, 3d degree PLEA                   Robbery, 3d degree SENTENCE               2-4 years, served concurrently with                        5-10 year sentence                                                                                                        DATE                   Jan. 8, 1991 PLACE                  Manhattan CHARGE                 Murder, 3d degree PLEA                   No plea SENTENCE               Awaiting trial</TEXT></DOC>
