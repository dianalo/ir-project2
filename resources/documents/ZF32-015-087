This is our vision.&quot;andM;To make networking easier, three changes need to occur in the PC industry,according to Flach.andM;First, LANs must be easier for users to build, Flach said.andP;  &quot;We need to takea complex task and make it easier.andP;  Software that knows how to install itselfwill make this easier.&quot;andM;Second, LANs must be easier to use.andP;  &quot;The key thing is andlsqb;the productandrsqb; isself-integrating.andP;  It figures out where it is in the network and integratesitself,&quot; Flach said.andM;Finally, LANs must be easier to manage.andP;  &quot;We are adding computer intelligenceto LANs,&quot; Flach said.andP;  Instead of having technical staff figure outdifficulties, the system needs to inform the user of what is wrong, he added.andM;To make room for networking features on CPUs and to reduce the number ofmicroprocessors in a PC, Intel is working to shrink circuits.andM;&quot;It is critical that we simplify so downsizing can occur.andP;  This makes thenetwork reliable and manageable,&quot; Flach said.andM;By integrating numerous features into one processor, according to Flach, itwill perform better, cost less, result in fewer problems and be smaller insize.andM;For now, Flach is not concerned about the physical limits of chipminiaturization.andM;&quot;Obviously, there are some atomic limits that will be reached,&quot; he said, &quot;butI do not see us reaching that until the early 2000s.andP;  andlsqb;For the nextandrsqb; 10 to 15years, we just see accelerating miniaturization.&quot;andM;A major role of the PCED is to improve existing hardware.andP;  PCED is alsoresponsible for improving CPU performance and developing new functions so thenetwork can keep up with the video and sound components of the PC.andP;  &quot;Thenetwork, as it relates to the installed base, is what we are concerned with,&quot;Flach said.andM;In the future, users will be able to buy a fax board, insert it into a PC andit will work, Flach said.andP;  &quot;You will see more andlsqb;end products from Intelandrsqb; inthe future,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;With networking and everything else, the needs areexpanding rapidly and we want to be able to serve them.andP;  It will be better,faster, cheaper and smaller.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
