Records are storedin the leaves of the tree; each leaf processor is responsible for recordsoccurring within a rectangular solid part of the space. Queries and recordupdates are fed into the root of the tree. Internal nodes selectivelydirect each query and update to leaves so that each leaf sees only theinformation geometrically close to the records for which it is responsible.File updates cause a reorganization of the tree, which is accomplishedin a manner that can accommodate either incremental or massive changes.The architecture can be viewed as a hardware implementation of Bentley'sk-d trees. The design is extensible and well-suited to implementationin VLSI.</TEXT></DOC>
