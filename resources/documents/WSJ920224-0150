The action clears the way for renewed U.S. sales ofsensitive equipment to two Chinese government companiesinvolved in military production and sales. It also liftsrestrictions on U.S. sales to China of satellite parts andhigh-speed computers.</LP><TEXT>   In return for the U.S. action, U.S. officials said, theyexpect China to announce that it will begin adhering tointernational guidelines limiting the export of ballisticmissile technology.   The decision to lift sanctions sparked an immediatecontroversy. Congressional Democrats complained that theadministration took its step despite intelligence informationindicating China continues to negotiate missile sales to theMiddle East. Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) took the unusualstep of asking Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell toschedule a closed-door briefing for the Senate so that alllawmakers could be briefed on the intelligence information.Aides said over the weekend that Sen. Mitchell plans todiscuss the request with Senate Republican leader Robert Doleearly this week before making a decision.   The controversy over missile technology also couldexacerbate the debate about Bush administration policy towardBeijing on another front. The Senate is scheduled tomorrow totake up the final version of a bill that would demand thatChina improve its performance on human rights, trade freedomand arms control in order to continue receiving most favorednation trade status. That's the treatment the U.S. affordstrading partners who are in good standing.   The House already has passed the final version of thebill, which President Bush opposes. The Senate seems likelyto pass the bill as well, but it isn't clear the measure willattract enough votes to override an expected presidentialveto. A group of senators from both parties has worked withthe administration to propose an alternative approach, inwhich Congress wouldn't formally impose conditions on China'strade status but President Bush instead would agreeinformally to seek improvements in China's behavior.   Mr. Bush must announce by early June whether he intends togrant China most favored trade status for another year. He isvirtually certain to try to maintain China's trade position.   One persistent problem in U.S.-Chinese relations has beenBeijing's refusal to sign the Missile Technology ControlRegime, an international agreement controlling longrangemissile technology. The problem reached a head in June, whenU.S. officials slapped on trade sanctions largely because ofalarm over China's reported shipments of missiles to Iran andindications Beijing was seriously negotiating similar salesto Syria.   The administration's announcement Friday that tradesanctions are being lifted didn't make clear whether Chinaformally will accept the full missile-control agreement. TheState Department said in a written announcement only thatChinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen sent the U.S. a letterFeb. 1 confirming earlier verbal promises to abide by theinternational &quot;guidelines and parameters.&quot;   This &quot;written commitment&quot; by China &quot;is an important stepforward in securing Chinese support for ballistic missilenonproliferation,&quot; the statement said.</TEXT></DOC>
