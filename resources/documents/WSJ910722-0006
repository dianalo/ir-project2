U.S. Magistrate Michael H. Dolinger in federal court inNew York ruled that Ascap must issue so-calleddirect-to-the-viewer licenses to cable networks. For severalyears, Ascap has been trying to require two levels oflicenses in cable television, one for the cable channel andanother for local cable operators that transmit the channelsto viewers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Everybody understands this to be a test case,&quot; said R.Bruce Rich, of Weil, Gotshal andamp; Manges, which represented 16cable programmers that joined Turner Broadcasting System Inc.in the action against Ascap. &quot;Both Ascap and BMI {BroadcastMusic Inc.} have rested their entire cable industry pricingstrategy on their ability to license at both levels. Thisputs the propriety of that strategy at stake.&quot;   In his decision, Magistrate Dolinger reasoned that localcable operators shouldn't be subject to separate licensesbecause &quot;they do not control what music is included in thenetwork programming that they air.&quot; The magistrate said thatsimilar logic was applied in the 1950s, when Ascap exploredlicensing both the broadcast networks and their localaffiliates.   Bernard Korman, Ascap's general counsel, said Ascap willask Magistrate Dolinger for permission to have the rulingreviewed by a federal appeals court. &quot;It's a very importantruling. We think it's wrong and that he made a reversibleerror,&quot; said Mr. Korman.   The fees the cable networks will be required to pay Ascaphave not yet been determined.   Not only is the decision viewed as a potentially seriousblow to the pricing strategy of Ascap, but it may affectother litigation. An antitrust suit filed by cable operatorsand cable programmers against BMI, the other majorperforming-rights society, is pending in Washington.   However, Edward Chapin, BMI's general counsel, said thedecision will not affect that group's dual-licensing planbecause BMI isn't subject to the same consent decree thatapplies to Ascap rate disputes. The decision, he said, &quot;isn'ta flat prohibition of split licenses.&quot; Ascap signed a consentdecree with the Justice Department in 1941 that regulates themanner in which it licenses copyrighted music for publicperformance.   The cable networks had also asked Magistrate Dolinger toapprove licensing for specific programs, as opposed to thestandard flat fees that cover all 45,000 Ascap composers andpublishers. In his decision, the magistrate said the consentdegree requires Ascap &quot;to make both of these licensesavailable to cable program suppliers.&quot;   The Ascap attorney, Mr. Korman, said his client also willfight the per-program license requirement. Ascap has arguedthat the new technology for cable is very different fromnetwork broadcasting in ways that weren't foreseen when theoriginal consent decree was drafted. &quot;Just what is a programon MTV or CNN?&quot; said Mr. Korman. &quot;It isn't clear the way itis with the networks.&quot;   ---   AUDUBON SOCIETY SUES FDIC over wetlands once held bydefunct Sandamp;L.   Conservationists and federal savings and loan regulatorsare tracking the California case, thought to be the firstlegal challenge to the regulators' handling ofenvironmentally significant property.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. holds 238 propertieslabeled as &quot;environmental concerns,&quot; plus an unknown numberof parcels that shelter endangered species, an FDICrepresentative said. The Resolution Trust Corp. also holdsmany environmentally sensitive properties seized from failedthrifts.   The suit contends that the FDIC violated the EndangeredSpecies Act by selling its lien on an 85-acre marshland to aprivate developer without consulting the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service. The suit, filed by the Sierra Club LegalDefense Fund on behalf of the Marin County Audubon Society,is pending in federal court in San Francisco.   The city of San Rafael, Calif., had allocated more than$570,000 to buy and conserve the land, which supports theendangered salt marsh harvest mouse and more than 100 speciesof birds. But the FDIC sold its lien -- acquired when theagency seized the State Federal Savings andamp; Loan in Lubbock,Texas -- to a local developer.   FDIC attorneys say the agency isn't subject to theEndangered Species Act, which requires federal entities toconsult the Secretary of the Interior before taking anyaction that might jeopardize endangered species or theirhabitats.   The FDIC has warned the local developer, Joe Lemon, thatany projects he undertakes on the wetland must comply withenvironmental laws, said Debra Meyers, managing attorney forthe FDIC's office in Irvine, Calif.   ---   COSTA RICAN WORKERS SUE over alleged injuries frompesticides.   The approximately 100 farm workers sued a Castle andamp; CookeInc. unit and three pesticide manufacturers, claiming theyhad been injured by exposure to pesticides that were exportedabroad, even after being banned in the U.S.   The plaintiffs say they were rendered sterile by exposureto the pesticides while working at banana plantationsoperated by Castle andamp; Cooke's Standard Fruit Brands unit. Thechemicals, known as nematocides, contained the compounddibromochloropropane, or DBCP.   Also named as defendants are Dow Chemical Co., Shell OilCo., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and OccidentalPetroleum Corp.'s Occidental Chemical unit; all three madeDBCP-containing products called Fumazone and Nemagon.   The Environmental Protection Agency banned use of DBCP inthe U.S. in 1979, not long after workers at an Occidentalfacility in California were found to be sterile. The compoundis suspected to be carcinogenic, according to the suit.   U.S. law permits manufacturers to export products that arebanned in this nation.   The suit alleges the workers &quot;suffered serious andpermanent mental and physical injuries,&quot; and that thedefendants were negligent and &quot;knowingly concealedinformation concerning the observed health effects ofDBCP-containing products.&quot;   Last year, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that foreignplaintiffs have the right to bring suit in the state's courtsfor damages they allege were caused by companies doingbusiness in Texas.   Louis Robles, who represents the plaintiffs, says the suitraises the issue of whether &quot;companies in this country, whoknow that a product is harmful, can exploit the lack of anadequate {legal} system in foreign countries by selling theirproducts there.&quot;   In Los Angeles, a Castle andamp; Cooke spokeswoman, saying shehadn't yet seen the suit, declined to comment.   A spokesman for Occidental Chemical said the unit nevershipped the pesticide DBCP to Costa Rica and doesn't believeany of its output of the pesticide was sent there. He saidthe company would argue that it shouldn't be part of thelawsuit.   Shell and Dow Chemical officials couldn't be reached.   ---   SAN FRANCISCO FIRM is paying new associates to delayreporting to work.   One measure of how the recession has hit law firms isThelen, Marrin, Johnson andamp; Bridges's offer of as much as$20,000 to law school graduates to postpone starting work atthe firm. The 15 new lawyers promised jobs by the law firm'sSan Francisco office have been offered $10,000 to delay workfor four months or $20,000 not to work for 10 months. The lawfirm's Los Angeles office offered 10 newcomers $20,000 topostpone joining the law firm.   Steven Hock, managing partner of the San Francisco office,said seven associates accepted the four-month offer; threeaccepted the $20,000 offer; and four are reporting to work.Mr. Hock said the law firm needed to cut costs and expects tosave a &quot;substantial amount&quot; by staggering the starting datesof the class of 1991.   Mr. Hock said that offers to new associates to delay theirlaw firm careers appears to be a new development. Jackson andamp;Walker, a Dallas law firm, is believed to be the only otherfirm still in business to have made a similar offer.   Jackson andamp; Walker's managing partner, Michael French, saidthat 12 of 15 new associates have accepted offers of $21,000to postpone starting by one year. He said Jackson andamp; Walkerisn't suffering a fiscal crunch, but that too many law schoolgraduates accepted job offers, probably as a result of thetight job market.   ---   NOTED: E.
