The measure passed 47-36 and was forwarded to the Senate aftermore than three hours of sometimes emotional debate witnessed byanti-abortion and pro-choice advocates packing the House gallery.   The bill is scheduled to face a hearing Wednesday in the SenateState Affairs Committee. It could come to a final floor vote asearly as Friday, and even opponents concede it stands a good chanceof passing.   The bill, like legislation rejected in Minnesota and Utah, wouldoutlaw abortion as a method of birth control.   The measure allows abortions only in cases of rape, incest,``profound and irremediable'' fetal disabilities, or to save thelife or prevent ``severe and long-lasting physical health damage''to the mother.   Sponsors contend that would prevent more than 90 percent of theapproximately 1,600 abortions performed each year in Idaho.   Penalties for ``civil contempt'' up to $10,000 for a firstoffense, $30,000 for a second and $50,000 for each additionalviolation could be assessed against any physician performing orattempting to perform an abortion, but women undergoing theprocedure would not be held legally responsible.   Gov. Cecil Andrus has not commented on the bill, but he has comeout strongly against abortion except in cases of rape, incest and athreat to the life of the mother.   Along with a Pennsylvania anti-abortion law, which has beenpartially blocked by a federal court injunction, the Idaho billwould be the most restrictive in the nation, according to itssponsors and the National Right to Life Committee.   ``I'm just so proud that Idahoans are taking the lead inreturning protection to our unborn children,'' said Kerry Uhlenkottof Grangeville, legislative coordinator for Right to Life of IdahoInc. ``The Supreme Court is inviting us to send up legislation, andthat's what we're doing.''   Pro-abortion forces were disappointed that legislators ignoredarguments that the measure would not pass constitutional muster,and that most Idaho residents want the Legislature to stay out ofthe issue, said a spokeswoman for the Idaho group Freedom MeansChoice.   ``I consistently heard the word `morality' used, always ascribedto the life of the unborn,'' said Sally Trott. ``I never heard itused in reference to the state's obligation if it's going to coercea woman to carry a pregnancy to term.''   On Thursday, the House approved and sent the Senate legislationrepealing the state's controversial ``trigger law,'' which setscriminal penalties including prison terms up to five years both forphysicians performing and women receiving abortions.   The trigger statute would have taken effect only if the U.S.Supreme Court ever completely overturns its 1973 Roe vs. Wadedecision legalizing the procedure through the first two trimestersof pregnancy.   After nearly 17 years of relative inactivity on abortion, Idahogot back into the fray after last July's U.S. Supreme Court rulingin a Missouri case.   The case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, effectivelyinvited more strident challenges of the underlying law created byRoe vs. Wade, anti-abortion advocates contend.   The July decision was the focus of Friday's debate. ``We oughtnot to fall victim to the idea that this bill isunconstitutional,'' said Rep. L. Ed Brown, a Republican who is theprimary House sponsor. ``No one knows what's constitutional in thiscase.''   But opponents cited objections raised by Richard Wilkins, aBrigham Young University law professor who is anti-abortion butcontends the birth control bill goes too far in challenging theSupreme Court's stand. He said it would be found unconstitutionalon a number of grounds.   ``I am honestly and geniunely convinced that if we pass thisbill, it will hurt the pro-life movement, that it will be struckdown,'' said Democratic Rep. Patricia McDermott, a Pocatelloattorney.</TEXT></DOC>
