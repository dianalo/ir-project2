The improved efficiency of non-farm businesses in churning outgoods and services from January through March was four times the 0.9percent gain reported in preliminary figures last month.   The increase compared with an 0.8 percent improvement inproductivity for all of 1987. Last year's figure included a 1percent decline the last quarter, nearly negating a 4.2 percentimprovement the third quarter.   The Commerce Department reported two weeks ago that the economyas measured by the gross national product _ the total output ofgoods and services in the country _ was 3.9 percent the firstquarter instead of 2.3 percent as earlier estimated.   Output among non-farm businesses ressponsible for three-fourthsof the nation's economic activity grew at a much healthier 5.9percent, the Labor Department said today, more than double theearlier growth estimate of 2.7 percent.   To achieve the higher output, businesses increased their totalemployee hours by 2.2 percent, up from an earlier estimate of 1.7percent.   The department's report on productivity and costs indicated thatservices rather than manufacturing accounted for most of theimproved efficiency, a reversal of past trends.   In manufacturing, the revised productivity figures showed a 2.8percent improvement for the quarter, down slightly from the 2.9percent earlier estimate.   The revised manufacturing output increase was 4.5 percent insteadof 4.3 percent. The additional hours worked to achieve the increasetotaled 1.6 percent instead of 1.3 percent as reported earlier.   Meanwhile, hourly wages in manufacturing rose at an annual rateof 4.6 percent in the first quarter, the biggest increase since a5.1 percent annualized boost the last quarter of 1985.   The higher wages, compared with a 3.9 percent increase in theearlier estimate and a 1.3 percent increase for all of 1987, raisedthe labor costs associated with each item coming off the nation'sassembly lines by 1.7 percent annually instead of 1 percent asreported earlier.   It also gave factory workers their first real wage gain _ 1.2percent _ after taking inflation into account. In 1987, the real,inflation-adjusted income of manufacturing workers fell by 2.2percent.   Annual hourly wage gains for all workers in non-farm businessesaveraged 3.4 percent the first quarter, keeping them exactly evenwith inflation.   The Labor Department said the quarter was the fifth in a rowwithout a real increase in hourly wages _ a phenomenon that hasoccurred only twice previously _ in 1979-80 and in 1980-81.   The labor costs associated with each unit of goods or servicesproduced by non-farm businesses declined at an annual rate of 0.2percent the first quarter, compared with a 4.5 percent increase thelast quarter of 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
