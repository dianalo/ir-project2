To ease the financial burden, many companies are adopting &quot;loss-on-sale&quot; programs that reimburse employees being relocated from depressed housing markets for some or all of their losses on home sales.    Contrast that with the first half of the 1980s, when soaring mortgage-interest rates were the foremost worry of transferees. Then, employers responded with mortgage-interest subsidies. Now, falling prices are more of a concern for many people. The Employee Relocation Council says that of 500 companies it surveyed, 19% have a formal loss-on-sale policy, while 28% consider reimbursement for home-sale losses on a case-by-case basis.    The programs aren't only for battered oil-patch cities. &quot;As strong as the housing market looks, both in terms of housing starts and resales, there are a lot of pockets where prices are falling, particularly in rural areas,&quot; says Kenneth Groh of Runzheimer International, a Rochester, Wis., consulting firm.    Rohm andamp; Haas Co., a Philadelphia chemical maker, has two loss-on-sale programs. One long-standing program is intended to help transferred employees who have lived in their homes two years or less. Another version added last spring for those who don't qualify for the older plan reimburses employees for up to 75% of their loss and up to 75% of capital improvements made during the first year of ownership.    Stephen Lucas, who handles employee relocation for United Telephone Systems Inc.'s headquarters in Overland Park, Kan., says his company's loss-on-sale program pays transferred employees what they paid for their houses. About 25% of United's headquarters transferees make use of the program.    Loss-on-sale programs aren't cheap. Runzheimer says companies having the programs in 1986 typically paid $7,600 for each transferred employee who sold a home at a loss.    ---   YOUR LOCAL AMWAY DISTRIBUTOR some day may come knocking to sell you a mortgage. Amway Corp., known mainly for its cleaning products, recently signed a five-year agreement with American Financial Network, a Dallas computerized mortgage origination system, to provide mortgages to Amway's 70,000 independent distributors in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. Initially, the program is designed to be an employee benefit, but John Pembroke, president of American Financial, hopes in a few years to have Amway's distributors making contacts with their customers about mortgages provided through the computer network.    As an incentive to get a mortgage through American Financial, Amway distributors will get 40% of their loan origination fee refunded. When the system is opened up to distributors' customers, the distributors will get a small fee for mortgages made based on their contacts. Mr. Pembroke says American Financial plans to offer mortgages from 10 different lenders.    ---   TAX OVERHAUL has devastated sales of private real estate limited partnerships, which used to provide big tax deductions for investors. But sales of publicly registered partnerships, which are sold on the basis of the income they pay, appear to have picked up the slack. According to Robert Stanger, a Shrewsbury, N.J., investment adviser, public-partnership sales in December were a record $1.8 billion. Partnerships with guaranteed current returns are selling well, according to Joel Pashcow of Integrated Resources Inc. William Turchyn of E.F. Hutton Co. says partnerships investing in &quot;niche&quot; properties, such as &quot;travel centers,&quot; are also doing well. For those not fluent in partnership jargon, a travel center is otherwise known as a truck stop.    ---   TAKING NO CHANCES: No one can accuse Beacon Cos. and Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc. of taking risks in their $193 million Rowes Wharf mixed-use complex on Boston's waterfront. They didn't even risk a long shot like the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; -- a controversial theory that envisions emissions of carbon dioxide warming the atmosphere, causing the polar icecaps to melt and raise sea levels. Just in case, Rowes Wharf, designed by Skidmore, Owings andamp; Merrill, sits an extra 3 1/2 feet above the high-water mark used by other waterfront structures.    ---   MITSUI MAKES ITS MOVE: After sitting on one of downtown Los Angeles's best development sites for four years, Mitsui Fudosan (USA) Inc., the U.S. arm of Japan's leading developer, is beginning its first major U.S. office project, a one-million-square-foot office tower at Wilshire Boulevard and Figueroa Street. But the twist is that Mitsui is going ahead without a major tenant in hand.    Giving the go-ahead without a major tenant is surprising, since Mitsui had wanted some leases before commencing the $200 million, 50-story tower. Ken Miyao, president of Mitsui (USA), says, &quot;Up until November, we wanted some pre-leasing before we started, but we've changed our minds.&quot; Local brokers speculate that Mitsui committed itself to a construction timetable partly to avoid embarrassment of further delay. To oversee construction, leasing and management, Mitsui hired Gerald D. Hines Interests, Houston. Mr. Hines has wanted a Los Angeles project for a long time, but he won't be an owner in this one. Instead, he'll be doing it for a fee, just as h e will for a proposed project in Philadelphia. </TEXT></DOC>
