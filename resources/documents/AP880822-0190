Leftist parties have boycotted elections since civil war beganin late 1979. They said their security could not be guaranteed andthat elections formed part of a U.S.-directed counterinsurgencyplan.   In the past, the Christian Democratic government of PresidentJose Napoleon Duarte has invited leftist political leaders toparticipate in elections but asked the guerrillas to lay down theirarms.   The Democratic Convergence, a coalition of three left-of-centerparties, said Monday it will choose its candidates in coming weeks.   The coalition includes the National Revolutionary Movement, thePopular Social Christian Movement and the Social Democratic Party.   Guillermo Ungo, leader of the National Revolutionary Movement,and Ruben Zamora, chief of the Popular Social Christian Movement,are the president and vice-president, respectively, of theDemocratic Revolutionary Front.   The front forms a civilian-military alliance with the FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla army battling theU.S.-backed government.   An estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in thecivil war.   The guerrillas condemned previous elections as farces, butleftist civilian politicians recently said guerrilla leadersunderstand their decision to take part in the March elections.   ``Our objective in the electoral process is the promotion of apolitical and negotiated solution to the armed conflict as anindispensable condition for fulfilling the Salvadoran people's mostpressing demands,'' a communique issued by the Convergence said.   ``The upcoming elections will not in themselves resolve thefundamental problems of our society ... but we are convinced thatour participation will bind and mobilize people around theobjectives of social justice, democracy, national independence andpeace.''   The election is likely to be a close contest between ElSalvador's two dominant parties, the incumbent Christian Democratsand the conservative Republican Nationalist Alliance.   The alliance, known as Arena, gained control of the legislatureand two-thirds of the country's municipal governments in electionsheld in March.   Duarte has been diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
