(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>dbPublisher After word processing and spreadsheets, databases must be one ofthe most widely used categories of personal computer application programs.andO;Yet despite this, database programs have changed little over the last fewyears.andP;  Both producers and designers of such programs have, until recently,resisted using high resolution displays and typeset quality output.andM;To a large extent the reason for this conservatism has been the type ofapplication to which database software like dBASE III or R:Base has beenapplied.andP;  The maintenance of mailing lists or stock control systems hardlycries out for typeset output or graphics images.andP;  For such applications a dotmatrix printer and a monochrome CGA screen are perfectly adequate.andM;However, things are gradually changing.andP;  Databases are being applied to otherapplications, in particular text based data such as catalogues or generalinformation databases and even image storage.andP;  A typical application which Ihave just completed, the cataloguing of nearly 500 different CD-ROM disks,involved a lot of text data.andP;  As I required it to be typeset, it was a tossup as to whether I used a database system like dBASE or simply manuallyordered it and entered it as running text on a word processor.andP;  In the past Iwould have used a word processor without any hesitation.andP;  In fact, I decidedto use the dBASE III clone dBXL.andP;  The reason for my choice of a database wasnot simply that it made record retrieval easier or was amenable to bothsophisticated analysis and indexing, after all, one can always use a documentretrieval program like Filepoint to do that with a WP file.andP;  The choice of adatabase was, instead, largely the result of the fact that it is now possibleto output a dBASE compatible file as a DTP quality document.andM;When outputting a database in the form of a typeset quality document youcould convert the database file into a format which is acceptable to aconventional DTP program such as Ventura or Pagemaker.andP;  The DTP program canthen be used to format the data properly.andP;  Alternatively, there are now acouple of special purpose database publishing programs which combine thefunction of a DTP program and a database report generator.andP;  It is one ofthese programs, dbPublisher, which is the main subject of this review.andM;Practical database publishingandM;For the CD-ROM disk database I was faced with either getting the dBASE fileinto Ventura, which I believe is the best DTP program on the market, or usingdbPublisher.andP;  It was a contest which dbPublisher won after only a fewminutes' consideration and a quick scan through the manuals.andP;  Although I hadnot used dbPublisher before, the choice was simply based on the fact that,although the file could be converted into a DTP document using Ventura, itappeared to be a far more complex and time consuming task than the equivalentoperation using dbPublisher.andM;To output the file with Ventura meant that the file was first converted to anASCII form which was readable by Ventura.andP;  The only way to do this is to usethe label command under dBASE to create a label file with the correct datacontents and format.andP;  This meant specifying the exact print fields, layout,use of tabs, spaces, carriage returns, etc.andP;  For a database with large andfairly complex records this can be an equally complex task which requires thewriting of a special dBASE program to execute it.andP;  Having done this theresult is simply an ASCII format text file which could have come from anyword processor; there still remains the task of creating and then fitting thedata into the appropriate DTP style sheet.andM;Incorporating a dBASE file into a Ventura or Pagemaker document is a complexprocedure which requires the user to have a reasonable understanding of dBASEand the ability to write dBASE code.andP;  There is also the additional problemthat for any reasonable length database file, it is very easy to run out ofsystem memory.andP;  If the system is fitted with plenty of EMS memory thenVentura Professional Extensions will allow you to handle all but the verylargest of database files, otherwise it is necessary to split the file into anumber of smaller blocks.andM;Getting dbPublisher runningandM;After getting half way through the installation procedure of dbPublisher, Idid begin to have doubts as I was told that I had insufficient availablememory.andP;  My system has a total of 8 MB of RAM, which seemed enough to me.andO;The manual fails to mention that one cannot run dbPublisher with any EMSmemory or TSR program.andP;  So out they came.andP;  The manual does mention thatdbPublisher requires at least 570 KB of free memory.andM;For a newly developed piece of PC software its failure to operate with eitherEMS memory or resident TSRs is a black mark against dbPublisher.andP;  Mostserious PC users will have both EMS and TSRs installed in their system.andP;  Itwould only have taken a couple of days to add the capability to have theinstall procedure handle both eventualities.andM;After getting dbPublisher running, I had another complaint.andP;  The systemrequires 8 MB of free hard disk space before it will run, although itoccupies only just over 4 MB.andP;  The remaining disk space is reserved for filestorage.andP;  Like most PC users I have 80 MB of hard disk, most of which aretaken up by useful programs which will definitely be needed in ten minutestime.andP;  Finding 8 MB of free space took some agonised soul searching.andM;What does dbPublisher do?andM;What the designers of dbPublisher have attempted to do is combine into onestand alone package a database report generator and a desk top publishingsystem.andP;  This was no easy task.andP;  Its stand alone nature means that they havehad to duplicate a great many of the standard database data handlingfunctions.andP;  They include things like full sorting using nested fields and subfields, multiple file merging, report generation etc.andP;  In fact so many ofthese basic functions are included that I am somewhat surprised that they didnot consider going the whole way and providing users with a full featureddBASE III clone.andP;  On the DTP side, the user is given full typographicalcontrol, plus the ability to incorporate text and image files from othersources.andP;  It supports both Postscript and a wide range of laser printer fontsto help produce high quality documents.andM;The user interface of dbPublisher is a windows-type display complete withicons, dialogue boxes and drop down menus.andP;  As with other such systems, themouse is also essential for dbPublisher; there is no alternative use of thecursor control keys.andP;  This means that you have to have a mouse before you canrun the program, and for those of you who don't like mice -- hard luck.andP;  Thisaside, the windows interface is very conventional and has a strong similarityto the standard window interfaces such as Microsoft Windows, X Window andGem.andM;The core of the dbPublisher system is the report template.andP;  This is a set ofinstructions which converts a given database file into the user designeddocument.andP;  It determines the page settings, printer settings, database filename, header and footer text strings, etc.andP;  The report template also containsa loop which will extract all the desired fields from each record, indexed bya particular field, and output them with any additional fixed text.andP;  Thefunction of the windows interface with its dialogue boxes and menus is simplyto make the creation of this set of report instructions easier.andP;  In all otherrespects it is the same as a report file created with dBASE III.andO;Unfortunately dbPublisher and dBASE III do not use the same command syntax soone cannot simply use existing dBASE report files.andM;The report file is thus simply a plain ASCII text file of instructions foraccessing and outputting the desired database.andP;  So far it is exactly like anyother database report generator.andP;  Unfortunately, although the report templateis an ASCII file, it is impossible to create it with a word processor ratherthan the mouse and menu technique.andP;  It would seem that the file structure isa lot more complex than it appears on the screen.andM;What makes dbPublisher different from other report generators is that thereport template creation process has been taken one step further.andP;  Thisconverts a simple report output into a typeset document.andP;  There are severalsteps in this process but the most important is the tagging of the reporttemplate with a set of typographical descriptions.andP;  These descriptionsdetermine the type size and font for each piece of text in the reporttemplate.andM;This typographical information is added to the report template in the form ofan expanded set of instructions.andP;  These typographical instructions conform tothe increasingly widely used Standardised General Markup Language or SGML.andO;This is a set of literal page descriptions which are, to a limited degree,comparable to the style sheets used by applications such as Ventura.andP;  Likethe style sheet and its associated linked documents the SGML command languagenot only defines the required typographical output but it also allows theimportation of other files, which could be text or even images.andM;The reason for going through this process of creating a report template andthen embedding literals into it is so that it can be repeatedly used toproduce typeset quality documents using both database information and text orimages obtained from other sources.andP;  An address file can thus be accessedfrom a database and merged with a standard letter from a word processor tocreate a high quality personalised letter.andP;  Furthermore, the letter headingin the form of a digitised image can be automatically added as part of thesame process.andP;  Once the command files have been set up this process can berepeated whenever desired without any need to go back through the templateproduction process.andM;Document creation withandM;dbPublisherandM;The creation of the report template is similar to the creation of othertemplates on a range of databases.andP;  The only real difference is that the useris presented with a WYSIWYG display of the report template and its predefineddocument header.andP;  This header can include a range of different things likeshort literal text strings, an expression label (such as a page number ordate), larger areas of local text, text imported from another text file,imported graphics images and even defined bar codes.andP;  When defining thisheader the user can select from a wide range of fonts and type sizes as wellas facilities for adding lines and boxes.andM;The entire header is created using the mouse-driven menu system and theprogram's simple text editor facilities.andP;  The resulting product can be viewedon an EGA or VGA screen as a WYSIWYG image at normal size, 50% or 200%.andP;  Ifrequired the template can be edited, and rulers are provided to ensurecorrect positioning with an option of inch, centimetre, pica or pointscaling.andM;Once a document header has been created, the next stage is to define thelayout and the part of the template which determines what portion of thedatabase is printed.andP;  Here the first step is to define the source of thedata.andP;  dbPublisher will import data directly from dBASE, R:Base, Clipper,FoxBase, Ability and, in fact, any ASCII and DIF format text file as well asthe PRN files produced by many Lotus 1-2-3 compatible spreadsheets.andM;Having determined the file type and name the user will then have to specifythe length and type of each data field, as well as which fields are to beprinted.andP;  Most databases will be organised in columns and rows, and creatingsuch a structure is the first operation.andP;  The program includes fullfacilities for drawing lines, putting in column headings and aligning orjustifying text or numbers within columns.andM;The position of each printed element is defined by a bounding box, whether adatabase field, a header, or column label.andP;  The size and position of thisbounding box can be controlled either from a dialog box or by directlypositioning using the rulers and/or snapping it onto a user definable grid.andO;The typographical data associated with the box is added using the windowsdialog box.andP;  When printing out a database there is only need to define theposition boxes for one record since they can be defined so that they arerepeatedly copied until the end of the file.andP;  Header or footer boxes can beautomatically repeated on every page in the same way.andM;Once the boxes have been defined, dbPublisher will perform an automaticalignment on the data placed in each box in order to ensure that all columnsare correctly aligned.andP;  However, when the box contains text the user isconfined to a maximum 255 character text length (an incomprehensiblelimitation which severely limits the usefulness of dbPublisher).andP;  This mustbe borne in mind when importing ASCII text files from non database sources orwhen attempting to use a database's memo field facility.andP;  The same shouldapply when creating the display boxes--enough room must always be left to fitthe longest possible entry for that data field or text file.andM;Some applications' boxes will be filled with literal text which has beendirectly entered into the box via the keyboard.andP;  In such cases, the copy canbe automatically fitted within the box with full attention being given toalignment, justification and hyphenation.andM;Times, Helvetica, Courier, ITC Avant Garde, ITC Bookman, Palatino and NewCentury Schoolbook are the in-built font types that can be used with bothliteral and variable text or data.andP;  Font sizes range between 4 point and 96point.andP;  The range is supposedly greater with Postscript printers, however, Iwas unable to use any of the printer fonts as it appears there is a bug incurrent versions of dbPublisher.andP;  There is also a variety of rules andshading patterns which can be drawn anywhere on the page.andP;  An interestingfeature of such rules is that they can be put under a conditional control.andO;For example, this means that a line could be drawn between every fifth recordeven though it is defined within the box layout of each record.andM;AssociationandM;The next stage is to associate each column and/or row with the appropriatefields in the chosen database's records.andP;  To help the user do thisdbPublisher can display a list of the component fields of a file which theuser can then select, position and assign a typographical tag.andP;  Although thesystem can read the database file header in order to display the componentsit is still necessary for the user to re-enter manually the field length andtype -- it is unfortunate that there is not an automatic default entry.andP;  Asone would expect from a database report generator, dbPublisher includes afacility for ordering the file using any one field.andP;  However, unlike dBASE itdoes not produce an index file and this means that, for large databases, theprintout speed can be very slow, with a lot of record searching beingrequired.andM;dbPublisher has the ability to perform calculations.andP;  This allows the user toprint out totals for columns of numbers, or use mathematical formulae whichrelate several columns in order to generate one or more new columns.andP;  Liketypographical information, these calculation instructions are embedded intothe list of report template instructions as part of the file handling loop.andM;Of course not all applications will involve simply printing out the databasein tabular form.andP;  Many, such as personalised letters, will involve insertionof variable data into a fixed text, or text and image, document.andP;  Where thisis the case then literal text or image files can be imported.andP;  These can comefrom a wide range of sources including most word processors as well as .PIC,TIFF, .IMG, .PIC, EPS, AutoCAD, HPGL and MAC document image files.andP;  It shouldbe noted that dbPublisher has no facilities for modifying any of these filesonce imported.andP;  The image files are tagged with data on image size, position,scaling etc.andM;The inclusion of a graphic image within a document means that it must beappended using an SGML command.andP;  This command not only specifies the filename, it also contains the scaling and placement data.andP;  It should, however,be noted that the image's aspect ratio will always be maintained.andP;  Theposition data will always refer to the image box's top left corner.andM;A specific version of an image is a bar code.andP;  However, whereas images haveto be imported, dbPublisher can create UPC A and E Code 2,3,5, and 9 barcodes.andP;  These are all US formats but are widely read by commercial bar codereaders.andP;  This feature is useful since it allows bar code labels to beproduced which are associated with, for example, an inventory database.andM;Creation of the report template with its embedded typographical informationcan be quite a lengthy process, but the resulting output is certainly aconsiderable improvement on the normal database report.andP;  There is also theadvantage that, once the design process has been done, there is no need torepeat the process for future print-outs using the same file.andM;ConclusionandM;It can not be denied that dbPublisher has a great many powerful and usefulfeatures.andP;  However, I remain unconvinced about its overall usefulness.andP;  It isa product where the designers seem to have lacked any clear idea as to theprogram's main function and as to who will be its principle users.andP;  As areport generator it is powerful but not much better than any of the manyother report generators on the market.andP;  As a DTP system, it has all the basicfunctions plus some which have been specially created for handling databasepublication, but it lacks the sophistication which most users now expect anddemand from DTP packages such as Ventura.andM;The use of SGML does give dbPublisher a lot of versatility.andP;  However, I ampersonally reluctant to start learning yet another page description language,having only just got to grips with Postscript.andP;  Similarly the dBASE commandlanguage is more than adequate.andP;  Why create a new version?andM;My main criticism is that it is a product where the designers still conceivethat databases are used for applications which are primarily numeric, such asstock control.andP;  This is not, however, the type of application where peoplereally need DTP quality database reports.andP;  Where it is needed is in textbased databases, such as dictionaries, encyclopaedias, directories andpersonnel files.andP;  These are applications which will generate long documents(which dbPublisher can not handle), and which need the automatic generationof indexes and the creation of comprehensive cross references, neither ofwhich can be done by dbPublisher.andM;In conclusion, this product could appeal to some users, but it is not aproduct which is universally needed by all database users and potentialdatabase users.andP;  It will undoubtedly find a solid niche within the marketsince it is a well produced and documented program.andP;  Neither is it overlyexpensive.andP;  However, I suspect that many users who have taken the trouble tolearn to program in dBASE will prefer to write the code for transferringdBASE data into a Ventura or Pagemaker document.andP;  In this way, one can havethe best of both worlds.andM;PostscriptandM;Since writing this review, I have reviewed another new product from RankXerox called FormBase.andP;  This is a database system which incorporates all thefeatures which dbPublisher has and should have had.andP;  It outputs DTP documentsof excellent quality, it will even output them in full colour, providing youpossess a thermal colour printer.andP;  This is a product which everyone who usesPCs should examine, and its comparison with dbPublisher is like comparingConcorde to a Tiger Moth.andM;Nick Hampshire is a freelance journalist specialisting in PCs.andP;  dbPublisherv1.0 is available from dealers, at 395 pounds sterling.andP;  It is distributed inthe UK by Migent, who are on 01 823 3823.andP;  Migent expect to ship v1.1 ofdbPublisher by early September.andP;  This reduces the RAM requirement to 512K,and the hard disk requirement to 6 MB.andP;  Version 1.1 will also include arun-time version, that can be called from Clipper code.andP;  dbPublisher 1.1 cannow import Paradox files.andP;  Future versions will handle Oracle and DataEasefiles, and an SQL version is under development.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
