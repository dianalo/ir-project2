(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors are preparing to try theirfirst case in the Defense Department purchasing scandal this month,nearly three years after they began the coast-to-coast investigation.   Already, a defense contracting firm, Hazeltine Corp., ofGreenlawn, N.Y., a former top executive of Unisys Corp., a formerprocurement officer with the Marine Corps and seven other defenseindustry figures have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges.   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson of the Eastern District of Virginia,who is directing the wide-ranging case, said he is pleased with theprogress of the investigation of the $150 billion Pentagonprocurement system.   Hudson said those pleading guilty have agreed to cooperate in the``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation that burst into public lastJune when FBI agents raided 44 locations around the country.   Court documents indicate investigators relied on evidenceobtained from telephone wire taps to obtain search warrants.   ``We're moving along at a good pace,'' Hudson said last weekafter a key figure in the case, Charles F. Gardner, a former generalmanager of a Unisys division on Long Island, N.Y., pleaded guilty tobribing a former high-ranking Navy official, Melvyn Paisley.   Paisley, the former assistant secretary of the Navy for research,engineering and systems, has not been charged with any wrongdoing.   Now a private consultant, he has denied through his attorneysthat he knew anything about Gardner's bribe, which the governmentsaid was in the form of buying Paisley's condominium in Sun Valley,Idaho, in August 1986 for an inflated price.   Hudson refused to say if he expects more indictments, but defenseattorneys say a federal grand jury is still hearing evidence.   Only one government official, Jack A. Sherman, formerly aprocurement officer with the Marine Corps, has admitted takingbribes. He acknowledged that he accepted $43,000 from consultants inexchange for confidential information about the competitive biddingprocess.   The government did not name the consultants. Sherman, who facesup to 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, is to be sentenced onApril 7.   Hudson also declined to answer any questions about whether thecase could encompass members of Congress, their campaigns or theirstaffs.   Gardner, for example, admitted that he caused $1,000 illegalcorporate contributions to be laundered to the campaigns of Rep. RoyDyson, D-Md., and former Rep. William Chappell, D-Fla.   Hudson, however, said neither congressman knew the contributionswere illicit.   The labyrinthian case involves charges that defense firms, ortheir employees, hired private consultants who bribed Pentagonofficials for information needed to win multimillion-dollarcontracts. Often, the small network of consultants consisted offormer Pentagon officials who maintained contacts with people insidethe Defense Department.   In the first trial, scheduled to start March 27 in U.S. DistrictCourt, prosecutors will attempt to prove that Teledyne Electronicsof Newbury Park, Calif., and three of its employees paid a privateconsultant, William Parkin, to obtain details about a $100 millionNavy radar contract.   Parkin is accused of paying another consultant, Fred Lackner ofWoodland Hills, Calif., who, in turn, gave money to Stuart Berlin, aone-time Navy procurement specialist, prosecutors say.   All the defendants have pleaded innocent to the charges, whichare contained in an indictment unsealed on Jan. 6.   ``My position on behalf of my client is that when all of theevidence is produced ... we are confident the jury will find BillParkin committed no crime whatsoever,'' said Gerard Treanor,Parkin's attorney.   When he receives the government's witness list next week, Treanorsaid he will find out if some of the people who have pleaded guiltywill testify against his client.   Parkin worked with a number of defense contractors includingUnisys, Hazeltine, Northrup and Teledyne Electronics. Parkin alsoknew Gardner, the former Unisys executive, and Paisley, Treanor said.   At the Pentagon, meanwhile, the case has touched off anotherreview of ways to overhaul the procurement system. Defense officialshave suspended or fired government employees identified in the ``IllWind'' investigation; suspended a number of companies andconsultants from doing any government work, and required a number ofcontractors to swear in writing they have not received any biddingbased on inside information.   Some of the companies also have launched internal reviews oftheir practices. Unisys, a computer company that was formerly theSperry Corp., examined its practices to ensure they were legal.Hazeltine has done the same thing, company officials say. Bothcompanies say they have cooperated with the government in theinvestigation.</TEXT></DOC>
