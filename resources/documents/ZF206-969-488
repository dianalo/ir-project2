(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Sigma Could Shake the Software WorldandM;A Japanese national project that could influence worldwide softwaredevelopment and sales into the 21st century is quietly nearing completion.andM;Sigma, which stands for Software Industrialized Generator and Maintenance, isa five-year, $200 million project sponsored by the Japanese government andprivate industry.andP;  Now in its final year, Sigma represents the largestnational effort in history to industrialize software development.andM;Sigma's GainsandM;Although analysts say it is still far too easy to judge its overall success,Sigma already has yielded a standardized Japanese workstations, networkingscheme and software development environment, as well as a Japanese version ofATandamp;T Unix.andP;  Perhaps equally important, Sigma has provided a common directionfor Japan's fiercely competitive computer industry.andM;&quot;The Japanese are setting themselves up to play in the global market,&quot; saidHoward Glassman, head of Data General's Japanese Business Development unit inthe United States.andP;  The Westborough, Mass., minicomputer maker is one of 11U.S.andP;  companies, including IBM and DEC, that have Japanese subsidiariesinvolved with Sigma.andM;To date, little has been written about Sigma in the United States.andP;  Most U.S.andO;companies have taken a wait-and-see attitude.andM;Yet, industry analysts say the project could have important short- andlong-term consequences not only for Japan, but for the entire computingworld; the effect of Japan's unified effort will be felt a decade from now inU.S.andP;  and European markets.andM;In the short term, analysts say, Sigma will affect companies selling softwareand workstations in Japan.andP;  After 1990, foreign vendors must conform to Sigmaspecifications to sell into the Japanese software development market.andM;Sigma uses a Japanese form of ATandamp;T's System V Unix known as Kanji.andP;  Theconsortium's embrace of a Kanji-based Unix adds weight to the ATandamp;T side ofthe international tussle between the Open Software Foundation and ATandamp;T todevelop a standard operating system.andM;In the long term, analysts say, Sigma should boost Japan's standing in thehighly competitive software market, but many observers say they do not expectto see solid results until the 1990s.andM;Sigma will offer the Japanese market advantages such as a Japanese-languageUnix, networking, windowing and other graphics capabilities, and databases,according to Makoto Asoh, an ATandamp;T Unix manager of software licensing andtechnical systems.andM;Noboru Akima, Sigma's planning manager, said other effects will be bettercommunication and technology transfer among companies and a larger softwaremarket.andM;Right now, it is not clear whether Sigma will yield commercial applicationsto rival Western products or whether it will even meet its basic goal ofeasing Japan's software shortage.andM;But many observers interviewed said Sigma will have a worldwide impact.andM;&quot;I think it's going to make the Japanese a lot more competitive in softwaredevelopment,&quot; said William Spencer, vice president of corporate research forXerox, whose Japanese subsidiary is a Sigma member.andP;  Jim Isaak, Posixstrategy director for DEC, whose Nippon DEC subsidiary is a Sigma member,said, &quot;If Sigma plays out, it will demonstrate to the Japanese and the worlda methodology for improving productivity in developing software.&quot;andM;Ultimately, many analysts say, moves to workstation computing and Unix areseen as significant shifts away from mainframe computing.andP;  Sigma &quot;legitimizesthe whole distributed computing model,&quot; Data General's Glassman said.andP;  &quot;Ithink it signals the dawn of a different way of computing [for theJapanese].&quot;andM;At its most basic, Sigma has a four-part strategy: to develop standardizedworkstations, an operating system, a networking scheme and, ultimately,software.andM;Manufacturers, software houses and banks are among Sigma's more than 180member companies.andP;  The Japanese government and Sigma members split the $40million annual budget.andP;  A Tokyo-based government group, the InformationTechnology Promotion Agency (IPA), oversees Sigma under the guidance of theMinistry of International Trade and Industry.andM;Laurin Herr, president of New York-based Pacific Interface, a high-technologyconsultancy for U.S.andP;  and Japanese companies, said Sigma's immediate goal isnot the development of applications software to compete with the &quot;the gloryboys&quot; of the United States and Europe.andM;Instead, through a systematic approach, Sigma is seeking methods to improvesoftware development productivity, which will in turn help Japan reach aneconomy of scale in software development, he said.andM;One likely result will be that Sigma will help the Japanese create bettersoftware to be embedded into a wide variety of products, from printercontrollers to VCRs.andM;&quot;The real thrust of the Sigma project is higher productivity on error-freesubroutine modules,&quot; he explained.andM;Toward this end, a mainframe center/library where members can work withpretested, bug-free modules and database service functions has been built.andO;Sigma workstations that conform to IPA-defined standard interfaces andprotocols also have been developed.andP;  A Sigma network connects workstations tothe center.andM;Sigma members have gathered, developed and catalogued two types of softwaretools: basic and application.andP;  Basic tools include project management anddatabase management documentation support functions.andP;  Application tools arein an earlier stage of development, but they will include business,engineering and process control applications.andM;&quot;Americans think the Japanese can't write software,&quot; Herr said.andP;  That is amistaken impression, however, because the Japanese can match anything createdin the West, he said.andM;To many, one of the most visible--and interesting--aspects of Sigma is thedevelopment of a standardized workstation.andM;Workstations built on Sigma operating system specifications have beenavailable since 1987.andP;  As of last fall, several Japanese vendors haddeveloped prototype Sigma workstations.andP;  Makers include Hitachi, Funjitsu,Matsushita, Mitsubishi, NEC, OKI, Sharp and Sumitomo Electric.andM;A good example is Fujitsu's Sigma Station 200, a 32-bit engineering devicebased on the Motorola 68020.andM;To date, no U.S.-based subsidiary has released a Sigma workstation.andP;  A NipponDEC spokeswoman said the subsidiary will continue to be involved with Sigma,but no decision has been made about whether it will offer a Sigmaworkstation.andM;Analysts say the creation of a new series of Unix-based workstations raisesinteresting questions for its future within Japan and in other countries.andO;Most observers at this early stage say they believe Sigma workstations willnot be exported to other countries, though no one is certain.andM;The specifications for the System V, release 2, Sigma operating systemincludes the ATandamp;T source code SVID Issue II, ATandamp;T's Asoh said.andP;  &quot;The major[Unix] extensions cover Japanese language handling, communication, amultimedia window system, graphics and a [relational database managementsystem] interface,&quot; Asoh said.andM;Akima said the Sigma system will move from the prototype to &quot;a practicalsystem&quot; by March 1990.andP;  &quot;Afterward, it will be provided as a commercialsystem.&quot;andM;&quot;Sigma only defines the operating system interface,&quot; Akima explained.andO;&quot;[Operating system] vendors are expected to modify to conform to thatinterface.andP;  Thus, it is Digital's decision,&quot; Akima said.andP;  VMS and Ultrix canbe target systems of Sigma users, Akima said, but only if they are modified.andM;Another Sigma product will be software for a variety of machines, fromprinter controllers to consumer goods, consultant Herr said.andP;  &quot;These arehighly reliable, low-complexity types of software,&quot; he said.andM;Usually those kinds of programs--requiring about 500-line modules--are usedfor productivity and increased control over the end product, he said.andM;Herr predicted that, in 10 years, there will be a significant decrease indemand in Japan for imported software of this type.andM;Although most agree that Sigma is significant because of its sheer size andnature, there is little consensus about how successful it will be ultimately.andM;Paul Cubbage, an analyst with market research company Dataquest of San Jose,Calif., said he is not convinced that the Japanese will overrun the softwaremarket.andP;  &quot;I've been hearing this since 1964,&quot; he said.andM;Fear of the Japanese is one of those &quot;unicorns&quot; that has threatened to rearits head frequently over the past 25 years but never appears, he said.andM;Pacific Interface's Herr said the Japanese are not known for developingcomplex or groundbreaking software.andP;  Instead, Japanese developers are knownfor &quot;brute force software of great inelegance,&quot; such as that for robotics,banking systems and scheduling of train reservations, he said.andM;Thus, Herr said, it's unlikely that Sigma initially will yield muchexportable applications software.andP;  In fact, he said, the effort probably willnot even yield Japanese software packages that will compete with high-endWestern products.andM;On the other hand, many believe U.S.andP;  software vendors are not likely toproduce Sigma-based products written in Japanese, industry watchers said.andO;For the most part, they will monitor the progress of Sigma.andM;In fact, some suggest that, instead of being a threat to U.S.andP;  companies,Sigma represents a significant opportunity to break into the Japanese market.andO;&quot;Americans should get out there and sell it,&quot; he said.andM;Sigma also will help weed out foreign companies trying to sell in Japan.andO;&quot;[The Japanese] are setting themselves up to play in the global market,&quot;Glassman said.andP;  &quot;It will show which American companies are coming to theJapanese market for the long term,&quot; he said.andM;In the end, Sigma products need to make a major impact in the Japanese marketlong before they will have an impact globally, vendors and analysts say.andM;&quot;I think there's a significant risk [Sigma] won't gain wide acceptance inJapan,&quot; said Data General's Glassman, echoing a common concern.andM;Sigma Falters on Some GoalsandM;Now in its final year, the Sigma project has experienced some delays anddissent among members.andM;&quot;I think it's moving very slowly, like any consortium,&quot; Glassman said.andP;  Sigmamanager Akima countered by saying that &quot;generally, the project is onschedule.&quot;andM;Sigma workstations reportedly have received only lukewarm support fromJapanese software houses, and software companies in general have been slow tojoin Sigma.andP;  It will probably take a year or more before it's known whethermore will join, industry analysts said.andM;Unix is also a question mark.andP;  Outside software development, Unix is not verypopular in Japan, industry watchers said.andP;  To gain necessary momentum, itmust be taught in Japanese universities and promoted in other areas, theysaid.andM;Possibly the biggest challenge facing Sigma is the fierce competition amongits members.andM;Echoing a common comment, Dataquest's Cubbage said Sigma members must cooltheir competitiveness and &quot;iron out a common direction.&quot;andM;&quot;This is blood-on-the-ground competition,&quot; Cubbage said.andP;  &quot;It's like askingwarlords to cooperate.&quot;andM;But a spokeswoman for Nippon DEC, Mayaumi Kunizane, said Sigma members arecooperating.andP;  &quot;Although the vendors are competitive,&quot; she said, &quot;as far asworking in Sigma, they are working closely in a very good environment.&quot;andM;Another factor that could hinder Sigma's progress is the Japanese culturalemphasis on conformity.andP;  Dataquest's Cubbage said the traditional Japanesecultural emphasis on conformity runs counter to the &quot;loony aspects&quot; ofsoftware development.andM;The Japanese have cultural problems of obedience to the norm--and nowconsensus--to overcome before they'll be able to compete in the softwarebusiness, said George Symon, a computer-aided software engineering productline manager for Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif.andM;After 1989, Sigma is expected to continue in a new form, tentatively titledthe Super Sigma project, officials said.andM;Although no details have been divulged, one possible direction is onimproving ease of use.andP;  &quot;The Sigma system in a system for professionalsoftware developers,&quot; Sigma's Akima said.andP;  &quot;Some extension should be made forease of use for nonprofessional developers.&quot;andM;As such, the next project will have &quot;software to be developed and handled byend users&quot; thus reducing the load for software developers, Akima said.andM;The next project also will focus on the portability of application software,according to AKima.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
