A restructuring plan for the propane gas distributor, thelargest in the country, will give a Clayton andamp; Dubilierinvestment fund a controlling stake in exchange for $100million while reducing First Boston and Quantum's interest to5%. The investment would also mark a switch in Clayton andamp;Dubilier's strategy. Traditionally, the firm has acquiredhealthy companies, but this marks the first time it has setout to rescue a problem company. Under the plan, bondholderswould be offered a combination of cash, new debt and equityvalued at about 40% of their original investment. TotalPetrolane debt would be reduced about $300 million under theplan.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement with First Boston and Quantum comes in thenick of time for Petrolane. The company -- burdened with$1.06 billion in debt stemming largely from the $1.2 billionbuy-out in 1989 -- has seen its sales squeezed by two warmwinters in a row; Petrolane sells propane, mostly toAmericans to heat their homes. It can't always pass alonghigher fuel costs to retail customers, so it is at the mercyof events that change energy prices. In the past year,Petrolane's propane costs were up sharply, exacerbated byevents in the Persian Gulf.   Earlier this year Petrolane said it didn't expect to havethe cash flow to meet its 1991 debt obligations, which total$165 million. It also has faced difficulty in maintainingworking capital agreements with its bank creditors. Thecompany said in an April filing with the Securities andExchange Commission that it has &quot;substantial doubt&quot; about itsability to continue as a going concern.   First Boston and Quantum each recently wrote off theirinvestments of $90 million in QFB Partners, the joint ventureformed for the leveraged buy-out, a Petrolane spokesman said.   Petrolane told its bank lenders that a moratorium oninterest and principal payments would be necessary to ensureliquidity for restructuring. It also said that $24.8 millionin interest due Oct. 1 to debenture holders would not bepaid.   In return for investing at least $100 million of newequity, Clayton andamp; Dubilier would end up with between 60% and95% ownership of Petrolane. Its exact stake would depend onwhether First Boston and Quantum choose to put more moneyinto the company to raise their stake back up to 20%, andwhether junk-bond holders take cash or a 16% stake inPetrolane for some of their bonds.   As proposed, Petrolane's $1.06 billion of long-term debtwould be reduced chiefly through an exchange offer for its$375 million of 13.25% senior subordinated debentures. Forthe $375 million, holders would receive only about $85million in new 8% subordinated debt but also would get $77.5million in cash and either a 16% equity stake or $20 millionin further cash. The remainder of Clayton andamp; Dubilier's cashinvestment would go toward working capital.   Analysts estimate the package offered to bondholders willpay 40 cents to 44 cents on the dollar. The price &quot;issomewhat disappointing,&quot; said New York money manager andanalyst Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland. &quot;It's a viablecompany, but unfortunately it has too much debt.&quot;   Nevertheless, Petrolane's bonds jumped as holders viewedthe proposed equity infusion as good news. Traders quotedthem yesterday at 42 cents on the dollar, up seven cents.However, most bond-exchange offers become subject to hagglingby holders who press for better terms.   Don Gogel, a Clayton andamp; Dubilier partner, said the firmbelieves Petrolane has potential to improve its performanceas a stand-alone company. Currently, many of Petrolane'scentral administrative services are provided by Quantum for afee.   Clayton andamp; Dubilier executives also said they would allowPetrolane managers and employees to buy a meaningful stake ina reconstituted Petrolane. Typically, managers and employeesof Clayton andamp; Dubilier-controlled companies have owned about10% to 15% of the business. &quot;In some ways, this is anextension of what we do in the buy-out business,&quot; Mr. Gogelsaid. &quot;We work with managements to achieve better results andtry to control a company to do so.&quot;   Petrolane's loss widened to $59.2 million in 1990 from$12.9 million in 1989. In the first six months of 1991, itsloss narrowed to $25.1 million from $27.8 million, althoughcash from operations more than doubled to $52.2 million from$20.2 million.   Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered theratings on the $375 million of Petrolane 13.25% subordinateddebt to Ca from Caa. It said the downgrade was prompted bythe exchange offer and by Petrolane's announcement that itwon't be making the October interest payment.</TEXT></DOC>
