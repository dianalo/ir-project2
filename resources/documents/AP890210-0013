They said he remains firmly in control of the nation he has ruledfor a decade and would not have visited North Yemen in mid-Januaryif he had been worried.   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters in New York onThursday reports of a coup attempt in his country were ``completelybaseless,'' adding, ``We absolutely deny'' claims that Iraqi armyofficers were punished.   Aziz met U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar at U.N.headquarters on Thursday regarding peace talks with Iran.   Reports of the coup attempt centered on air force officers fromSamarra, whose people are traditional rivals of Hussein's clan inTikrit, another provincial town.   An Armed Forces Day parade scheduled for Jan. 6 was canceled,without explanation, and European defense ministers who had beeninvited were asked stay away.   Some diplomats in the Iraqi capital said the plan was for threeair force planes to bomb the president's reviewing stand.   While acknowledging details were sketchy, they pointed to theabsence in public of Air Marshal Hamid Shaaban, the air forcecommander highly decorated by Hussein during the eight-year war withIran. They said this indicated a plot, and said Shaaban might havebeen executed.   Others said the attempt was made while Hussein visited Egypt inDecember, with the result that up to 200 military officers andmembers of the ruling Baath Socialist Party were executed.   Dissident Kurdish groups and Iraqi exiles have reported theexecutions.   Earlier reports said a top military commander disappeared justafter the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war with Iran and two othersdied in mysterious helicopter crashes.   Hussein, 51, became vice president when the Baath Socialist Partyseized power in 1968 and has been president since 1979. He rosethrough the political ranks, not the military.   Iraq was plagued by coups before the Baath party took over, andIslamic fundamentalist groups loyal Iran tried to assassinateHussein several times in the early years of the war.   He has controlled the military by appointing members of hisTikrit clan to the most sensitive posts and keeping other officersin line with a combination of favoritism and purges.   A Middle East dipomat said: ``He got rid of any generals orcommanders as soon as their stars started to shine a bit brighter.''   According to a Western envoy, ``There's always some potential fora coup. The only plausible quarter is from the military.''   The diplomats speculate that plotters may have been encouraged bytrouble within Hussein's tight-knit clan over his treatment of hiseldest son, Odai, who killed a favorite presidential bodyguard inOctober.   They said the son was imprisoned, but later released, and now isbelieved to have a diplomatic post in Switzerland.   Hussein's wife protested when he ordered that Odai be triedpublicly for what some saw as a tragic accident, and she went tolive in Switzerland, where she remains, the diplomats reported.   Gen. Adnan Khairallah, her brother and Iraq's defense minister,also had a brief falling out with Hussein because the generalintervened, they said.   ``If the opposition had come from any other direction, Saddamwould not have hesitated in chopping their heads off, but this washis clan,'' the Middle Eastern diplomat said.   Serious economic problems have gained attention in Iraq since thecease-fire.   The president wants to revive ambitious development plans he hadbefore the war, including construction of steel and petrochemicalindustries that can produce high-tech weapons.   His government borrowed an estimated $70 billion during the warand creditors are pressing for payment, but none has offered to helpfinance reconstruction.   Iraq still has 1 million men under arms and military analysts sayit cannot afford to keep them there for long, but demobilizationwould them on an economy with no industrial base.   Many lack basic job skills because they have been fighting a warfor eight years. One diplomat said frustration might lead them totake up arms against the government if they became unemployedcivilians.</TEXT></DOC>
