The program announcementcontains all information and forms needed for submission of proposals.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Introduction</ITAG>The teaching faculty are a key element in undergraduate education. It isimportant that they be intellectually vigorous and excited about theirdisciplines, that their knowledge of recent developments in their fieldsbe up-to-date, and that they regard the teaching of undergraduates as animportant and rewarding activity. To these ends, the National Science Foundation(NSF) provides leadership and financial assistance to encourage collegesand universities to take a systematic interest in the currency and vitalityof the faculty who are primarily involved in undergraduate teaching andto assist them in enhancing their disciplinary capabilities and teachingskills.This announcement describes the <T3>Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement Program,</T3> which makes grantsfor Undergraudate Faculty Seminars and Conferences. These provide opportunitiesfor groups of faculty to learn about new techniques and new developmentsin their fields.In addition, faculty may submit their own research proposals to the appropriateresearch programs at NSF, either as regular research proposals or throughthe <T3>Research in Undergraduate Institutions</T3> (RUI) activity (refer tothe RUI announcement, NSF 85-59). They may also associate with an existingor proposed NSF-supported research program through the <T3>Research Opportunity Awards</T3> (ROA) activity (refer also to NSF85-59).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Program Description</ITAG>A. Purpose and ScopeThe Undergraduate Faculty Seminars and Conferences activity makes grantsto conduct regional or national seminars, short courses, workshops, orsimilar activities for groups of faculty members. Grants will be made forthe development and implementation of ways to assist large numbers of facultyto learn new ideas and techniques in their fields, and to use the knowledgeand experience to improve their undergraduate teaching abilities.The purpose of the program is to meet the needs of faculty who teach primarilyundergraduate students. These faculty need to be familiar with new experimentaltechniques and ways of incorporating them into undergraduate laboratories.They need to have experience with new instrumentation and to have the opportunityto evaluate its suitability for use at their home institutions. They needto be familiar with recent theoretical developments in their fields whichbear on their undergraduate teaching. They need opportunities to synthesizeknowledge which cuts across their own and other disciplines. Finally, theyneed opportunities to interact intensively with experts in the field andwith colleagues who are active scientists and teachers, both during thecourse of a project and in a continuing way after the end of a project.Projects must be regional or national in scope, and may include seminars,short courses, workshops, and conferences, or a series of such activities,but are not limited to these. Actual sessions may vary considerably inlength, normally from a few days to a few weeks.The kinds of activities which are encouraged include projects which_andbullet; Allow participants to gain experience with recent developmentsin the field;andbullet; Enable participants to work with innovative technologies relevantto their academic responsibilities and which allow them to evaluate thetechnology.andbullet; Permit participants to work with experts who have had a part inoriginating the ideas which are the subject of the project or who haveworked extensively with the ideas or techniques;andbullet; Allow participants to work with industrial scientists, mathematicians,and engineers and to lean new industrial applications in the field;andbullet; Permit participants to obtain personal experience working withnew ideas and techniques, rather than just hearing about them;andbullet; Encourage participants to develop instructional materials thatinclude new ideas and techinques;andbullet; Explore new methods of delivery of information, such as the useof computers or teleconferencing, either in work with other participantsduring the project or in participants' activities after the project;andbullet; Encourage sustained interaction among the participants followingthe project and continued opportunities for learning about the topics ofthe project;andbullet; Encourage the increased participation of underrepresented groupsin science, mathematics, and engineering.andbullet; Although the kinds of projects and activities described here areexpected to include the majority of those supported through the UndergraduateFaculty Enhancement Program, proposals envisioning additional mechanismfor enhancing the vitality of the undergraduate faculty will be consideredby NSF.B. Eligibility Criteria and Limitations<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Eligible Activities</ITAG>The aim of the program is to improve the technical capability of experiencedfaculty members in ways which will enhance their ability to teach up-to-dateundergraduate courses and laboratories. Thus activities proposed must bejustified explicity by their capacity to enhance participants' teachingactivities for undergraduate students at one or more levals. It is notappropriate to propose activities which will primarily benefit a facultymember's research abilities. On the other hand, projects of a purely pedagogicalnature which do not serve top enhance the faculty member's technical capabilityare not appropriate, either. Activities should be especially designed forexperienced teachers and ordinarily should not duplicate parts of coursesnormally given by graduate departments.The emphasis of the proposed project must be on the active involvementof the participants in working with the topic of the project and in interactionwith scientists, engineers, and mathematicians experienced in the topicand with fellow participants. Thus, for example, in laboratory projects,participants must have access to equipment and facilities and have sufficienttime to become familiar with experimental techniques and the experimentswhich may be done. In theoretical projects, participants must have sufficientopportunity to learn the theory and explore its implications. In all projects,participants must actually work extensively with the substance of the topicand interest with experts. Projects which are primarily lecture coursesare therefore not appropriate in most cases.The Foundation is concerned about the underrepresentation of women, minorities,and disabled persons in careers in science, mathematics, and engineering.Projects involving members of these groups as part of the staff or as targetaudiences are especially encouraged.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Eligible Organizations and Fields</ITAG>The program will accept proposals from scientists, engineers, and mathematiciansrepresenting appropriate organizations, including colleges and universities,national laboratories, professional societies, other non-profit organizations,for-profit industries with the scientific expertise and facilities, andother organizations which can conduct the described activities.The project should have one director, who is responsible for its operationas well as for its planning and administration. Normally, the directorwill be an authority in the topic of the project and will devote full timeto it during its operation. In some cases it may be appropriate to havean expert other than the director who is responsible for the substanceof the project. Other senior personnel may also be involved if appropriate.In all cases it is desirable that there be sustained interaction betweenthe project personnel and participants.Proposals may be submitted for support in the fields of science engineering,and mathematics ordinarily supported by the Foundation, including the physicaland biological sciences, social sciences, mathematics, computer and informationsciences, and engineering, or for interdisciplinary projects which dealprimarily with these fields. Specifically excluded from support are activitieswhich are addressed to clinical fields associated with the sciences, suchas medicine, nursing, clinical psychology, and physical education, as wellas activities which primarily involve social work, home economics, business,the arts, and the humanities.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Types of Support Available and Cost Sharing</ITAG>The Foundation will provide support for reasonable direct costs of operatingthe project, including salaries of senior personnel, clerical support,supplies, the cost of publications, postage and telephone charges, andcomputer services. The grantee institution is expected to provide facilitiesand equipment necessary to operate the project, and therefore no permanentequipment or facilities will ordinarily be supported. Indirect costs willbe allowed.Participant costs should be shared between the grant and the participatingfaculty member's home institution. It is expected that the home institutionwill bear travel costs; the cost of lodging and meals for participantsmay be requested from the grant. If there are other participant costs theproposal should describe them and request funds for them. No tuition orother fees may be charged to the participants. Participants also may receivea stipend of up to $250 per week of the project.Projects may be operated in one or more continuous sessions. Although summermay be most convenient for many directors and participants, it may be appropriateto operate some projects during the academic year. Ordinarily, awards willbe made for one year, although proposals with sufficient justificationfor projects which continue over two or three years will be considered.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Selection of Participants</ITAG>After awards have been made by NSF, directors should publicize their project'savailability widely to the intended audience. Faculty members who wishto participate in a particular project will apply directly to the projectdirector. Directors, acting in consultation with a selection committeeif desired, and within the guidelines established by NSF in this announcement,will be responsible for selecting participants for the project and makingarrangement for its operation. The program is intended for those whose primary duties lie in undergraduateteaching. Participants should ordinarily have a minimum of three yearsof undergraduate teaching experience by the beginning of the project. Theparticipants must be drawn from a regional or national audience; wheresome participants come from the host institution, the grant will not payparticipants support costs for local participants. The number of participants in a project will depend on the facilities andequipment available and on the topic of the activity. A project shouldaccommodate enough participants to enable it to have an impact on the teachingof a subject and to allow for diversity in the group of participants; aminimum of 10 participants is suggested. On the other hand, projects shouldbe planned so that the number of participants is not so large that accessto equipment and project personnel is unduly restricted.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Preparation of Proposals</ITAG>This announcement sets forth basic information needed for proposal preparation.Proposers must also consult the publication Grants for Research and Educationin Science and Engineering (GRESE) (NSF 83-57 rev. 11/87) for additionalguidance. This publication is available from the Forms and PublicationsUnit, National Science Foundation, 1800 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20550.Proposers should use the forms contained in the Undergraduate Faculty EnhancementAnnouncement and Guidelines (NSF 88-33) not those in GRESE.Except as modified by the guidelines, standard NSF guidelines on proposalpreparation, submission, evaluation, NSF awards (general information andhighlights), declinations and withdrawals contained in GRESE are applicable.More comprehensive information is contained in the NSF Grant Policy Manual,Revised, (NSF 77-47) available for purchase at $12.00 from the Superintendentof Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. The GrantPolicy Manual ordinarily is not needed in the process of preparing a proposal.In the event that the submitting organization has never been the recipientof an NSF award, however, it is recommended that appropriate administrativeofficials become familiar with the NSF policies and procedures containedin the NSF Grant Policy Manual, Revised, which are applicable to most NSFawards. (If a proposal from such a institution is recommended for an award,the NSF Division of Grants and Contracts will reequest certain organizational,management, and financial information.

The following considerationsapply specifically to this program:A. <T3>Senior Personnel</T3> There must be a single project director who willbe primarily responsible for administration and operation of the project.Other senior personnel may be listed if appropriate, but proposers shouldkeep in mind the desirability of sustanied interaction with an expert orexperts in the topic to be covered.B. <T3>Other Personnel</T3> Project directors will need secretarial help inhandling applications for the project and assistance in arranging for theproject's operation.C. <T3>Fringe Benefits</T3> Allowable according to institutional policy.D. <T3>Equipment</T3> Ordinarily not allowed.E. <T3>Travel</T3> Allowed if necessary for the operation of the project,but not for participant travel to and from the project.F. <T3>Participant Support Costs</T3> Reasonable costs for subsistence forparticipants are allowed. Include here also a stipend of up to $250 perweek paid to each participant, pro rata for periods not an integral numberof weeks.G. <T3>Other Direct Costs </T3>Include here costs of supplies, publications,postage and telephone charges, and computer services as necessary. Includealso estimated costs of publicizing the availability of the project tothe intended audience. H.<T3> Indirect Costs.</T3> Calculated according to the standard procedureoutlined in GRESE, p. 7. Note that indirect cost agreements usually donot allow indirect costs to be charged on participant support costs (budgetcategory F).6. <T3>Curriculum Vitae</T3> A curriculum vitae should include a record ofthe director's education and professional experience, honors, and a listof relevant publications, particularly in the previous 5 years. Also includehere vitae for other senior personnel who will have a substantial responsibilityfor the operation of the project.7. <T3>Statement of Current and Pending Support</T3> All current and pendingexternally-funded support to the director and other senior personnel mustbe listed on the form found on page 00.8. <T3>Results of Prior NSF Support</T3> If the project director has receivedsupport from NSF in the past 5 years, the proposal must include a sectionsummarizing the results of that support. It must include_andbullet; The NSF award number, amount, period of support, and project title.andbullet; A summary of the results of completed work. (To facilitate reviewthis summary should not exceed three pages.)andbullet; A list of publications and formal presentations acknowledgingthe award.

All analyses conductedon the data will report aggregate statistical findings only and will notidentify individuals.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Review Criteria</ITAG>NSF evaluates proposals on the basis of four general criteria:1. Performance competence_This criterion relates to the capability of theinvestigator(s), the technical soundness of the proposed approach, theadequacy of the institutional resources available, and the proposer's recentscience, engineering, or mathematics research and education performance.2. Intrinsic merit_This criterion is used to assess the quality, currency,and significance of the scientific and technical content and related instructionalactivity of the project within the context of undergraduate science, engineering,and mathematics education.3. Utility or relevance of the project_This criterion is used to assessthe impact the project will have on the faculty participants and theirundergraduate students.4. Effect on the infrastructure of science, mathematics and/or engineering_Thiscriterion relates to the potential of the proposed project to contributeto better understanding or to improvement of the quality, distribution,or effectivenesss of the Nation's scientific/engineering/mathematics research,education, and human resources base.See page 9 of GRESE for an additional discussion of these criteria.Grants are awarded on a competitive basis. In selecting propoals to besupported, the Foundation is assisted by peer reviewers, who are scientists,engineers, or mathematicians drawn primarily from the academic communityand also from research organizations and professional associations.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
