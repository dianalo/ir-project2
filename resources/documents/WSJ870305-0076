Ernest BeazleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BSMINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) </IN><TEXT>   Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation's No. 3 steelmaker, has asked its New York law firm to study the implications of a bankruptcy-law filing, but the troubled company stressed it hasn't any near-term plans to take such action.    Sources said that Weil Gotshal andamp; Manges, a prominent firm known for bankruptcy work, has also briefed Bethlehem directors about how a company might operate under bankruptcy-court protection and its effect on employees, creditors and customers. Sources said the work began in recent months.    Walter F. Williams, Bethlehem chairman, acknowledged in an interview that, among a number of restructuring options, the Bethlehem, Pa., steelmaker's management &quot;has educated ourselves about the pluses and minuses&quot; of seeking refuge from creditors under a Chapter 11 filing. &quot;That's part of management's responsibility -- to know all the options it has,&quot; he said.    But Mr. Williams emphasized that, in spite of its financial problems -- such as posting losses in 17 of its past 20 quarters -- Bethlehem would consider such a move only as a last resort. He indicated that the steelmaker still expects to make it through 1987 with sufficient liquidity. He added that Bethlehem wouldn't seriously consider a filing unless it had exhausted its cash reserves, fattened by asset sales over the past year.    &quot;We certainly have no plans to file right now,&quot; Mr. Williams said. &quot;But if things continue to get worse, we're all -- all of us (major U.S. steelmakers) -- going to have to reexamine our options.&quot; Still, he added, &quot;We don't think Chapter 11 is a solution&quot; to the restructuring of the industry.    Asked what would prompt Bethlehem to follow through with a filing, he said, &quot;When it looks like we're going to run out of cash.&quot;    Like other steelmakers, Bethlehem began to take a closer look at the bankruptcy laws in the months after the July 17 filing of LTV Corp., the nation's No. 2 steelmaker. LTV was the third major steelmaker to enter the bankruptcy courts, following Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and McLouth Steel Products Corp. Sources said Weil Gotshal's work also includes analysis of the LTV and Wheeling-Pittsburgh bankruptcy-law cases.    Competitors are closely tracking Bethlehem's fortunes. Any ultimate decision in favor of a filing could spur additional moves in the beleaguered industry. Already a fifth of the nation's steelmaking capacity has been reorganized under a bankruptcy court's protection. And producers increasingly complain that the filings have enabled the reorganized companies to wrest substantial cost savings -- particularly through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.'s absorption of unfunded pension liabilities -- thus exerting cost pressure on surviving companies.    Bethlehem's long-term future is uncertain. Yet most industry executives agree with Mr. Williams that Bethlehem isn't a near-term candidate for a bankruptcy-court filing.    Analysts figure that Bethlehem will turn a profit on an operating basis during the first half of the year. Moreover, the steelmaker has made no unusual moves signaling a bankruptcy. It is paying creditors on time, and it hasn't built up inventories of raw materials from suppliers, who would be unsecured creditors in any bankruptcy-court proceedings.    Other factors also suggest that Bethlehem won't pursue such a course for now. The ramifications of LTV's bankruptcy-law filing -- particularly the federal pension agency's claims against LTV assets in court -- aren't yet clear. In addition, the Reagan administration is evaluating several proposals to help the industry restructure.    Mr. Williams and Bethlehem are helping lead the industry's campaign for more White House relief. Other steelmakers, individually and through their trade group, are lobbying the administration, too. But in Bethlehem's case, the appeal is more urgent. Bethlehem, with a product mix that emphasizes capital goods, a particularly weak market, is less capable of riding out an economic downturn. Moreover, its debt-bloated balance sheet has been weakened by $2 billion in losses since 1982.    Since taking the helm of Bethlehem last spring, Mr. Williams has boosted liquidity by selling non-steel assets and cutting back capital spending. As a result, Bethlehem's year-end cash position improved to $463 million from $395 million at Sept. 30 and $99 million at the end of 1985.    In addition, Bethlehem's costs continue to fall. Two new continuous steel casters -- a more-efficient steelmaking process -- are expected to reach peak production this year, enabling Bethlehem to produce 85% of its flat-rolled and plate steel through the process.    Barring sharp deterioration in the company's markets, the combination of liquidity and lower costs should be more than enough to weather 1987. &quot;We can get through this year, and that means meeting all our pension requirements, debt repayments and interest payments,&quot; Mr. Williams said. </TEXT></DOC>
