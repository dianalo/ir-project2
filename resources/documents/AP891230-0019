Students were among the anti-government protesters who shouteddown Ceausescu at an official rally in Palace Square on Dec. 21,and they were among those killed when security forces opened fire.   Now in the days following the ouster and execution of Ceausescu,the students say they have an obligation to those who have fallento guarantee the reforms.   ``We don't have any weapons but to protest. We can do nothingbut strike,'' said Diana Ghionea, an education student and veteranof the bloody demonstrations that helped trigger the revolution.   ``We have two representatives in the provisional government. Ifthey (the others) don't listen to them we will be organizing aprotest and a strike,'' said Diana Voicu, another young veteran.   Student demonstrations are new to a country where Ceausescucrushed dissent movements during his autocratic 24-year rule.   ``It's nobility around here to be able to say you were in thesquare on Thursday,'' said Ms. Ghionea, referring to the day theyshouted down the dictator.   ``I was almost killed three times over that weekend but myfriends saved me, pulling me aside in the shooting,'' she said.   Older Romanians praise the students for their courage, tellingreporters that nothing would have started, would have beenpossible, without the students.   But the students worry that the people will settle for toolittle. They hope for the best from the self-proclaimed provisionalgovernment but intend to hold it to its promise of free electionsand national reform.   ``There is change now. The people are so happy to get rid ofCeausescu that they think anything will be better,'' said Ms.Ghionea.   ``We didn't have food until now, and now we have TV. We had onlytwo hours of TV now we have eight. The old people think this isfreedom. They think, `What do the students want?' This is notfreedom.''   Other students at the university nodded approval as the youngwomen told reporters that the students have a debt to all of thosewho died in overthrowing the dictatorship.   The students met Thursday to form the Democratic Student League,a group they say will push for educational reform and seekeducational assistance from abroad for the university.   Ms. Ghionea and Ms. Voicu insisted the league would beapolitical, seeking only to improve the educational system. Itseeks to shorten the hours in class from 10 to eight a day, toraise education standards, to end political interference in thecurriculum and end compulsory military training for women.   ``Ceausescu wanted to keep us in class so long that we would nothave time to meet and to think,'' said Ms. Voicu.   The students said they will not allow the league to become aninstrument of their political dissent because educational reformsare so vital.   But they emphasize that does not mean the students will notbecome political, that they will not take to the streets again totry to preserve their vision of the revolution.   Ms. Ghionea echoes the voices of so many other, older Romanians.   ``We can't go back again,'' she says. ``We can't.''</TEXT></DOC>
