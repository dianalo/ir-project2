Cuts in procurement will account for nearly half of theoverall $24 billion the committee is expected to carve out ofthe Bush administration's nearly $307 billion defense budgetrequest.</LP><TEXT>   The first clear indication of that trend is likely to cometoday, when committee chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) isexpected to urge the House to eliminate procurement money foradditional B-2 bombers built by Northrop Corp. The move couldsave at least $35 billion by the late 1990s.   Meanwhile, the House panel is ready to eliminate some125,000 active-duty troops in 1991, but lawmakers andcommittee aides said savings from those cuts are likely tototal well under $1 billion for the fiscal year starting Oct.1. That's primarily because the committee will provideexpensive health-care benefits, temporary housing, relocationassistance, severance payments and other programs intended tohelp cushion the blow for both officers and enlistedpersonnel removed from the Pentagon's payroll.   Rep. Aspin told reporters last Friday that the committee,which is slated to approve a defense authorization bill atthe end of the month, will rely more heavily on savings fromprocurement cutbacks than the Senate's version of themeasure. &quot;We're sympathetic to the problem of&quot; soldiers beingforced out of the military, he said.   The Senate Armed Services panel envisioned saving nearlytwice as much in military personnel accounts next year,although it called for fewer troop cuts. The Senate committeealso approved the bulk of the Pentagon's request for theradar-eluding B-2 and the LH helicopter.   In the case of the LH, some senior House Republicans areleading the battle to remove it from the budget entirely.Moreover, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in the next few weeksis expected to propose deep cuts of his own to reduce theprogram's $42 billion price tag, according to Pentagonofficials.   For the radar-eluding B-2, each of which carries anestimated price tag of $800 million or more, Rep. Aspin'santicipated attack could be the most serious blow yet. Lastyear, the Wisconsin lawmaker played a major role in keepingthe embattled bomber alive. But in the past few months, costestimates have skyrocketed and the Air Force has come underincreased criticism on Capitol Hill for failing toeffectively monitor contractor performance or justify theneed for a full fleet of B-2s.   Rep. John Kasich (R., Ohio), a leader in the drive to killthe B-2, declined to talk about Rep. Aspin's anticipatedchange of heart. But in an interview, he said that at least207 House members have indicated they support an amendment tocomplete flight tests but cut off production after 16 planes.&quot;The program is literally falling apart,&quot; Rep. Kasichasserted. A Northrop spokesman declined to comment.   In the face of escalating congressional opposition, theAir Force is defending the B-2 by emphasizing what it claimswould be a nearly $4 billion penalty for canceling proposedproduction plans. In a letter earlier this month, Air ForceSecretary Donald Rice warned members of the HouseAppropriations Committee that the government would have tobear the high cost of closing facilities, compensatingcontractors and disposing of tools, parts and othermaterials. Temporarily shutting down production for just oneyear, Mr. Rice maintained, would increase those costs to $4.6billion.   Members of the House committee, however, have challengedthe termination cost estimates released by the Air Force.</TEXT></DOC>
