The commercial fishery, on a coastwide basis, would be limited to 20%of the total catch (recreational catch plus commercial landings) each year.The decision to implement commercial controls would be based on two separateindices and a two-tiered approach. If the catch in the commercial fisherywere projected to equal or exceed the 20% limit during the upcoming year,then highly efficient gears (purse seines, pair trawls, and runaround gillnets) would be prohibited from use in exclusive economic zone (EEZ) watersif those gears were responsible for the increase in the commercial landings.At the same time, a state allocation system would also be implemented.Commercial landings data from the 10-year period, 1978-1987, for each statewould be used to determine the average percentage of coastwide commerciallandings by state. These percentages would be used to determine the amountof the coastwide quota allocated to each state. Quotas would apply to commerciallandings in each state, regardless of where the bluefish were caught.2. Anglers would be restricted to a possession limit of no more than tenbluefish or the more stringent possession limit at the state of landing,if such a limit exists. The Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, after consultationwith the Councils and the ASMFC, could modify the possession limit to betweenthree and ten bluefish per angler based on evidence of stock condition.3. Commercial hook-and-line fishermen may take more than the possessionlimit if they have a commercial permit issued by the state of landing.Without a permit, fishermen using hook-and-line gear would be restrictedto the possession limit. For states without a permit, a federal permitwould be required. No person in the EEZ could exceed the possession limitwithout a federal or state commercial permit. The captain, crew, and passengersof party or charter vessels would be restricted to the possession limitif the vessel were carrying passengers for hire. A captain in possessionof a commercial fishing permit could use the permit (i.e., exceed the possessionlimit) when no passengers were aboard.All hearings will be tape recorded with the tapes filed as the officialtranscript of the hearing.
