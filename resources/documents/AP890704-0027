The Apache is the nation's most sophisticated helicopter gunship.The Army now has 486 of them.   The grounding announced Monday came in the wake of last week'scrash in northern Florida of an Apache gunship assigned to theFlorida National Guard. The co-pilot was killed and the pilot wasseriously injured when the tail rotor came off.   The Apache fleet was last grounded in August 1987 whileinvestigators studied the failure of one component of the tailrotor. The Army said Monday, however, it had already ruled out thatproblem as a factor in last week's crash. The Apache fleet wasgrounded twice in 1986, both times for relatively minor problems.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><UNK>Study Calls for Change in Weapon Purchases</UNK><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration should create a weapons``procurement corps'' separate from the Pentagon to eliminateconflicts of interest in purchasing weapons, a study suggests.   The study was released Monday by Ralph Nader's Center for Studyof Responsive Law.   The study cited varying reasons for the Pentagon's weaponsproblems, including overreliance on new technologies, insufficienttesting, inadequate competition and a ``revolving door'' between thePentagon procurement system and private defense contractors.   It also blamed members of Congress for judging new weaponsprojects on the potential economic payoff for their own state ordistrict rather than the actual need for the weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
