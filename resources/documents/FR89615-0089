(TBWT), the Estate of RogerL. Putnam, and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSX), seek approval under 49 U.S.C.11343, <T3>et seq</T3>., for TBWT to acquire a 55.34-mile CSX line between SulphurSprings and Broco, FL. The applicants contend that this transaction meetsthe criteria for a minor transaction under 49 CFR 1180.2(c), and they submitteda conforming application in accordance with the railroad consolidationregulations at 49 CFR Part 1180. They also seek authority under 49 U.S.C.11301 to issue securities to finance the transaction. TBWT is a motor carrier with nationwide general commodities authority.It presently provides service to a patron in the Tampa, FL area, shippingfrozen seafood to various points in the United States. It will be a ClassIII railroad following the proposed transaction. TBWT is a closely heldcorporation. The Estate of Roger L. Putnam controls it, but does not controlany other carriers. CSX is a Class I common carrier by railroad operatingin 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the Province of Ontario, Canada.It is a unit of CSX Corporation. The line sought to be acquired includes: (1) Track from Sulphur Springs,FL (milepost SR-838.26), to Brooksville Yard, FL (milepost SR-792.98);(2) the Broco Spur, from Brooksville Yard to Broco, FL (4.33 miles); (3)the Shands Spur, from Brooksville to Shands (1.84 miles); and (4) BuschLeads andplusmin;1 (2.91 miles) and andplusmin;2 (0.98 miles) in Tampa, FL.The line has about 100 active patrons. Freight moving over it consistsprincipally of malt liquors, coal, limestone, cement, and lumber. It carriersno overhead traffic. In 1987 CSX handled about 7,450 carloads originatingon the line, and about 6,200 carloads in the first 10 months of 1988. CSXprovides no passenger service on the line. The applicants state that the transaction will enable TBWT to develop newrail business and operate in essentially a new market. It will therebyprovide a revenue base permitting improved service to all of its patronsand improving its financial viability. The applicants maintain that thebenefits in turn will preserve adequate rail transportation service andpromote competition in the area. The applicants contend the acquisition will not lessen any interstate orintrastate competition or create a monopoly or restrain trade in freightsurface transportation. They state that TBWT and CSX do not serve any ofthe same shippers. The area that is served by the rail line is also servedby many motor carriers, and it is well traversed by several U.S. highways,an interstate highway, and numerous state and local roads. TBWT intends to operate the line to be acquired with its own employeesworking under TBWT rates of pay, rules, and working conditions. All nineCSX positions affected by the acquisition of the line will be abolished.However, CSX and two of the unions representing its employees have enteredinto implementing agreements under <T3>New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., </T3>360 I.C.C. 60,and CSX is negotiating with the representatives of the remaining affectedemployees to enter into <T3>New York Dock </T3>implementing agreements. These conditions are appropriatefor employees affected by the acquisition. The Purchase and Sale Agreement for the sought acquisition, provides thatTBWT will pay $2 million in cash for the line's improvements and $26,000per year for use of the real estate over which the line runs. To financethe transaction and provide working capital, TBWT will issue: (1) 100 sharesof common stock with $1 par value; (2) $2 million of privately placed seniordebt, secured with the assets that TBWT acquires from CSX; and (3) $700,000of subordinated unsecured debt placed with its equity owners under promissorynotes. TBWT maintains that only the stock issuance is subject to Commissionregulation, and that the debt issuances are not because they are not akinto publicly traded stocks or bonds. It contends, however, that if the Commissiondetermines it has jurisdiction over both, then both should be approvedas consistent with the public interest and pro-competitive. We ask forcomments specifically addressing these jurisdictional and public interest/pro-competitiveissues.The railroad consolidation regulations, with appropriate modifications,are suitable for consideration of this application, even though the proposalinvolves a motorrail rather than a rail-rail transaction (here, a ClassI railroad and a motor carrier that will be a Class III railroad). <T3>See, e.g., CSX Corporation and American Commercial Lines, Inc._Control_SCNOAcquisition Corp.</T3> (not printed), served May 25, 1988. Under andSection;1180.4(b)(2) of our regulations, we must determine initially whether aproposed transaction is major, significant, or minor. This transactionhas no regional or national significance, and it will neither result ina major market extension nor reduce the present level of competition. Wefind the proposal is a minor transaction under andSection; 1180.2(c). Sincethe application complies with our regulations governing minor transactions,with appropriate modifications, we are accepting it for consideration.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Since the transaction involves an acquisition of a railline by a motor carrier, rather than <T3>vice versa,</T3> the intermodal acquisition criteria of 49 U.S.C. 11344(c)do not apply. <T3>See</T3> Finance Docket No. 31268, <T3>The Pittston Company_Control Exemption_Buffalo Creek and Gauley RailroadCompany, Et Al.</T3> (not printed), served April 4, 1989; and Finance DocketNo. 30743, <T3>The Pittston Company_Control Exemption_Buffalo Creek and Gauley RailroadCompany</T3> (not printed), served February 26, 1986.  TBWT has asked for our approval under section 11301 of the securities issuance,<T3>i.e.,</T3> the 100 shares of common stock. Since those shares are beingissued in connection with a transaction under section 11344, the exemptionfrom our regulation at 49 CFR 1175.1(a) does not apply. While a separateapplication for approval of the stock issuance need not be filed (49 CFR1175.1(b)), the application does not contain sufficient information tomake an affirmative finding under 49 U.S.C. 11301. Accordingly, applicantswill need to file additional financial data regarding the stock issuance.For example, we are told that the shares to be issued have a one dollarper share par value, but we are not told the actual price at which theshares will be sold or whether the shares confer any voting power on theshareholders. We also need detailed information about the effect of theproposed stock issuance on the viability of the carrier. <T3>See </T3>49 U.S.C. 11301(d)(B)-(D). We will attempt to resolve this issue within the decisional time limitapplicable to the minor transaction. Our ability to do so, however, willdepend to a great extent on the timing of applicant's supplemental filingsand any replies thereto. The application and exhibits are available for inspection in the PublicDocket Room at the Offices of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington,DC. In addition, they may be obtained upon request from applicants' representativesnamed above. Any interested persons, including governmental entities, may participatein this proceeding by submitting written comments. Comments must be filedno later than July 10, 1989. The United States Secretary of Transportationand the Attorney General of the United States must file their commentsno later than July 25, 1989. Applicants' reply is due August l4, 1989.An original and 10 copies of all pleadings must be filed with the Secretary,Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington DC 20423. Written comments must be served concurrently by first class mail on theSecretary of Transportation, the Attorney General and applicants' representatives.Written comments must also be served on all parties of record within 10days of service of the service list by the Commission. We plan to issuethe service list by July 25, 1989. Any person who files timely writtencomments shall be considered a party of record if the person's commentsso request. In this event, no petition for leave to intervene need be filed.Consistent with 49 CFR 1180.4(d)(1)(iii) written comments must contain:(a) The docket number and title of the proceeding; (b) The name, address, and telephone number of the commenting party andits representative upon whom service shall be made; (c) The commenting party's position, <T3>i.e.,</T3> whether it supports or opposes the proposed transaction;(d) A statement of whether the commenting party intends to participateformally in the proceeding or merely comment on the proposal; (e) If desired, a request for an oral hearing with reasons supporting therequest; the request must indicate the disputed material facts that canonly be resolved at a hearing; and (f) A list of all information sought to be discovered from applicant carriers.Because we have determined that the proposal constitutes a minor transaction,no responsive applications will be permitted. The time limits for processinga minor transaction are set forth at 49 U.S.C. 11345(d). Discovery may begin immediately. We admonish the parties to resolve alldiscovery matters expeditiously and amicably. This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the humanenvironment or energy conservation. <T3>It is ordered:</T3> 1.
