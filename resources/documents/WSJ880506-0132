Separately, a shootout early yesterday ended a two-week hostage siege in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia, leaving 15 hostage-takers and two army troops dead.    But political analysts say these events, while helping Mr. Chirac, likely won't be enough to close what was a 13-percentage-point gap in the final legally publishable opinion polls last weekend. A poll by the Harris organization for Radio France showed Mr. Mitterrand winning a second seven-year term by 56.5% to 43.5%. While the effects of the developments in Lebanon and New Caledonia on the presidential balloting remain uncertain, Mr. Chirac is hoping to score at least 47% in the balloting. Such a respectable loss would probably ensure Mr. Chirac and his neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic Party a leading role in the restructuring of the French political right-wing that would follow a Mitterrand victory.    Mr. Chirac, who got a disappointing 19.9% of the votes in the first round of presidential voting April 24, behind Mr. Mitterrand's 34.1%, will be struggling for control of a divided right wing with centrist backers of former Prime Minister Raymond Barre, who got 16.5%, and extreme-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who drew a suprising 14.4%.    A Chirac aide said the hostage release will &quot;change the climate&quot; for the last days of campaigning, allowing Mr. Chirac to talk up his successes. </TEXT></DOC>
