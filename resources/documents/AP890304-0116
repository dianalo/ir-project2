Contrast those shelters with statements by Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev that a nuclear war cannot be won and shouldnever be fought and you face the imponderable dilemma of the nuclearage:   Why do the superpowers have atomic weapons and how will they usethem?   In the Kremlin and at the White House, the superpowers arereviewing their own nuclear doctrines. National security adviserBrent Scowcroft is directing the U.S. effort, one that is expectedto change the defense budget, the shape of the U.S. nuclear arsenaland American positions in arms control talks.   U.S. and Soviet theories on the use of atomic weapons haveevolved over the decades, from the construction of the first bombsin the 1940s until the widespread acceptance now that nuclearweapons are too dangerous to use in war.   ``We are profoundly devoted to the idea of a nuclear-freeworld,'' Gorbachev wrote in ``Perestroika.''   ``If the huge stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and other weaponsthat have been accumulated are unleashed, nothing will remain of theworld. What we are talking about is the survival of humanity.''   Such statements are welcomed in the West.   But scrape away the rhetoric, and some disturbing facts remain.   Since 1980, the Soviet Union has modernized its arsenal by addingland-based missiles with about 1,000 warheads, including two newmobile classes, the SS-24 and SS-25, which are not matched by theUnited States.   The United States has 12,683 boms and warheads, compared with10,358 for the Soviet Union, according to the Center for DefenseInformation, a liberal Washington lobbying organization.   The U.S. and Soviet arsenals are designed largely for use againstthe other superpower. And although they have never used them againsteach other, the threat is always there, summed up in the by-word ofthe nuclear age: deterrence.   Deterrence, according to the Americans, equals MAD _ MutualAssured Destruction.   Over the years the Soviets have taken a somewhat different view.   As early as 1977, the-Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnevenunciated the ``Tula Doctrine,'' which states that a nuclear cannever be won and should never be fought. That doctrine has beenadopted by Gorbachev.   But many Red Army officers, writing in theoretical journals andtraining manuals, argued otherwise, leading many Western analysts toconclude that Soviet war plans included a possible ``first strike''against the United States.   And many believed at the time that the Soviets might use tacticalnuclear weapons to try for an early victory during a war in Europe,a view that was buttressed by the deployment of medium-range SovietSS-20s in Central Europe in the late 1970s. The SS-20s are beingdestroyed under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty, signedby Gorbachev and President Reagan in December 1987.   The SS-20 deployment, which was criticized by Soviet journalistslike Aleksandr Bovin and reformist scholars in civilian think-tanks,was part of a massive military build-up under Brezhnev, giving theSoviets parity with the United States in nuclear weapons, and nearparity or superiority in conventional and naval forces.   The Soviets now say they have adopted the ``new thinking'' ofGorbachev and want to eliminate nuclear weapons by the end of thecentury.   But U.S. officials say the Soviets have made no move to dismantletheir long-range nuclear forces or the bunkers where Kremlin leaderscould hide in the event of war.   The Pentagon said in its annual report, ``The Soviet Threat,''that the first bunkers were built 40 years ago, and that ``yetanother round of construction on these complexes began in the early1980s, when Soviet leaders were publicly emphasizing that a nuclearwar would be so catastrophic that attempts to achieve victory oreven seriously limit damage in such a war no longer made sense.''   ``The bunkers are a manifestation of the old thinking,'' said oneof the think-tank scholars who is backing Gorbachev's campaign totrim the military. He asked that his name not be used because thebunkers are considered a state-secret.   Yet, many American critics of the Pentagon are persuaded that the``new thinking'' has taken hold in Moscow.   John Steinbrunner, director of foreign policy studies at theliberal Brookings Institution in Washington, said the bunkers arenot evidence of a duplicitous Soviet nuclear doctrine. Rather, hesaid, they are similar in concept to the airplanes that the UnitedStates keeps at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, waiting towhisk top leaders out of danger in the event of war.   ``There are very good reasons to have those bunkers in order tostabilize your command,'' said Steinbrunner. ``If your centralcommand can be eliminated by pre-emptive attack, you can be knockedout.''   In addition to its plan to keep the president airborne during theinitial stages of a nuclear attack, the U.S. military also maintainssecure underground facilities in Colorado and other states, largelyas communications installations. The distinction is that the U.S.system of underground facilities is not as extensive as that of theSoviets in terms of the number of officials they would house or thelength of time they might remain in them.   Soviet leaders have claimed that they developed nuclear weaponsin response to such bombs in the U.S. arsenal. But the memoirs ofSoviet physicists, published in the 1980s, give evidence that theKremlin secretly sought to be the first to develop the bomb.   Soviet work on the bomb began in the late 1930s. Through spies,the Soviet leadership learned in 1943 of the U.S. Manhattan Project,and ordered physicists to speed up their work.   After the United States dropped an A-bomb on Hiroshima in 1945,the Soviets redoubled their efforts.   ``Provide us with nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time.You know that Hiroshima has shaken the whole world. The balance hasbeen destroyed. Provide the bomb _ it will remove a great dangerfrom us,'' Stalin told the physicists.   Four years later, the Soviets tested their first bomb, accordingto David Holloway, a scholar at Stanford University and author ofthe book ``The Soviet Union and the Arms Race.''   The United States, nevertheless, retained a significant edge inthe number of weapons and means to deliver them. Unable to affordthe cost of maintaining a full land army in Europe, the UnitedStates adopted the less expensive alternative of balancing Sovietmilitary might with nuclear weapons. That remains the fundamentalprinciple of U.S. nuclear doctrine in Europe.   Although the Red army occupied most of Central Europe after thedefeat of Nazi Germany, the American A-Bomb denied them superiorityon the continent.   During the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet politicians and physicistsengaged in a game of geo-political chess, maneuvering to place eachother's cities, military bases and allies at nuclear risk.   Through the '50s and '60s, the Soviets struggled to keep pacewith the U.S. nuclear arsenal, but were hamered because unlike theAmericans, they did not have bases near their adversary on which tobase bombers and missiles.   The launching of the first man-made satellite, the Soviet sputnikin October 1957, signaled that the Russians had the means to buildintercontinental ballistic missiles, and helped prompt John F.Kennedy to warn of a ``missile gap'' during his successfulpresidential campaign in 1960.   In 1962, Kremlin leader Nikita S. Khrushchev tried to put Sovietmissiles within striking distance of the United States by deployingthem in communist Cuba.   The Soviet failure in the missile crisis spurred them to achievestrategic parity with the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
