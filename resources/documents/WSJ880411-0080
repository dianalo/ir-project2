The Bank Board said the suit, filed in federal court in Houston, was the first it has brought under its 1986 regulations on securities offerings.    According to the Bank Board, David Felt originally was ordered to sell Reliance Savings Association because he allegedly had violated certain regulations pertaining to conflicts of interest and improper loan documentation. He agreed in August 1986 to sell the thrift, but failed to clear the final offering circular for the sale with the Bank Board, regulators said. That final circular differed &quot;significantly&quot; from a preliminary version given to regulators, and contained false financial data, the Bank Board said.    The Bank Board said that much of the stock was sold to members of Reliance's board and to investors connected with two other companies Mr. Felt operates. In its suit, the Bank Board asked that cash or notes given to Mr. Felt by investors in those transactions be returned to the investors.    Mr. Felt couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
