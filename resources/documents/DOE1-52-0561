Nannochloropsis spp. strains were examinedusing strains obtained from culture collections only. In all three organisms,genetic diversity was found to be extremely high compared to terrestrialplants. This was shown by both the physiological traits and the enzymebanding patterns. There were no apparent relationships among patternsof differentiation revealed by different traits nor by the type of environmentfrom which clones were isolated. In general, strains obtained from existingculture collections showed greater diversity as a group than did strainsfreshly collected from natural populations. However, even stringentlyselective sampling protocols applied to natural populations yielded avariety of genetically different strains. This probably indicates thatthe total genetic diversity in the species examined was underestimated.The amount of genetic diversity shown by these organisms coupled withpreviously collected data on other microalgae demonstrates that speciesof microalgae have far greater intrinsic genetic diversity than do speciesof higher plants. These data indicate that classical breeding approachesto strain improvement will probably not be successful even in the Chlorophyceae.The best strategy for strain improvement will most likely be dependenton the development of novel recombinant DNA techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
