The company cited softness in the computer disk-drive market and problems with a new chip-making facility.    Last April, John K. Buckner, chief financial officer, said he was optimistic that Control Data would be profitable every quarter this year, alluding to a need to re-establish credibility on Wall Street. &quot;This is the year where we simply have to demonstrate that this company can be consistently profitable,&quot; he said at the time.    Control Data, which has been recovering from huge losses two years ago and remains a topic of takeover speculation, still &quot;is not out of the fragile stage,&quot; Mr. Buckner said in making the latest announcement. &quot;The third-quarter outlook is a reflection of that fact.&quot; The company wasn't more specific about its third-quarter estimate.    Control Data had first-quarter earnings of $7.7 million, and earnings of $9.2 million in the second quarter.    News of the expected third-quarter shortfall renewed disappointment among investors as Control Data closed Friday at $20.625 a share, down $1.625, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    The latest problems include what a spokeswoman said were technical difficulties delaying production at the company's VTC Inc. chip-making unit. She said production was running approximately six months behind schedule for manufacturing of the high-performance integrated chips. Some chips are being produced, but not at the desired rate, she said.    The spokeswoman also cited a slump in the disk-drive market, but said the company still expects improved results from its data-storage business by year's end. Control Data reiterated that it expects a stretch-out of computer system shipments to government customers.    Prior to Friday's announcement, some securities analysts had been projecting annual earnings of at least $40 million, or $1.50 to $1.65 a share. Despite the latest problems, some analysts said they remain optimistic about the computer products and services concern's long-term prospects.    &quot;These turnarounds never turn as fast as you'd like to see, but these guys are making progress,&quot; said Frederick A. Wise of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. Despite disappointment over the third-quarter prognosis, he believes Control Data still could report $100 million in operating earnings for the year.    Barry F. Bosak of Eberstadt Fleming Inc. called the near-term situation &quot;an annoyance. When a company cleans itself up as much as they did, you like to see it make steady, profitable progress.&quot; Mr. Bosak said he expects Control Data's supercomputer operation, ETA Systems Inc., to fall short of its $100 million revenue target this year by $10 million to $20 million.    Another analyst, Gerard F. Hallaren of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. said he remains more concerned with what he believes are increased losses in Control Data's Training and Education business, which has been a perennial problem. &quot;I think the shortfall (there) is far larger than anything they might wish to construe is going wrong with data storage,&quot; he said. &quot;I think data storage is having a very good year.&quot;    Mr. Hallaren and others have speculated that Control Data is likely to sell its disk-drive business. The company recently turned that business into a subsidiary, called Imprimis Technology Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
