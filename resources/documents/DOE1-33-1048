Three spacing trialshave completed their 1-, 5-, or 12-year growing seasons. The latter trialwas established without fertilizer or any post-planting vegetation control;the relationships of planting density to mortality, tree growth, andbiomass production per hectare have been fairly well defined for suchextensive management. Earlier fertilizer studies have indicated thatinadequate N is likely to restrict growth of cottonwood plantations,and low P may limit productivity of alder plantings. Tests establishedthis year have created a range of nutritional environments, in irrigatedand nonirrigated plots, for two genotypes of each genera. The studiesof natural genetic variation in red alder are now 17, 8, 5, and 1 year(s)old. All indicate substantial variation and suggest large gains in productivitythrough selection and propagation of superior trees from certain coastalsites. Their work on clonal propagation shows that stem and branch cuttingsof red alder can be easily rooted, but efficient methods for conditioningthe plantlets for outplanting remain to be developed. A field guide forassessing site quality and new curves for height growth and site indexestimation (base age 20 years) has been completed. 13 references.</TEXT></DOC>
