Clark pleaded innocent to charges of embezzlement and insider trading.    Mr. Clark, a lawyer, declined to comment at federal court in Manhattan after entering his not-guilty plea to 55 felony counts. Of the counts, 38 were related to a scheme in which nonpublic information was misappropriated from The Wall Street Journal in 1983 and 1984. Ten counts were related to the alleged embezzlement of $3.7 million from clients of his former New York law firm. A federal grand jury indicted Mr. Clark last week.    Mr. Clark's trial, expected to start later this year and to last about a month, will pit F. Lee Bailey, the noted criminal-defense attorney, against Howard Wilson, chief of the U.S. attorney's office criminal division here.    Mr. Bailey couldn't be reached yesterday.    Mr. Clark is already a defendant in a related Securities and Exchange Commission civil case brought in 1984. Mr. Clark's SEC case, however, has been delayed at the U.S. attorney's office's request until the criminal case is resolved, the SEC said.    Mr. Clark faces a maximum of 270 years in prison and $262,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.    The insider-trading charges against Mr. Clark involve a former Journal reporter's leaks of advance word of market-sensitive Journal stories to Peter N. Brant, a former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. broker. Mr. Brant, the government charges, passed some of the information on to Mr. Clark, who is charged with making $453,000 in illegal trading profits. Mr. Brant is expected to serve as a government witness at Mr. Clark's trial.    The 17 counts against Mr. Clark that don't directly involve stock trading allege breaches of his fiduciary duty to clients of Appleton, Rice andamp; Perrin, which was dissolved in November 1984. The indictment charges Mr. Clark engaged in a &quot;continuing scheme&quot; to defraud clients of the firm and later used &quot;embezzled funds&quot; to trade in the stock market. </TEXT></DOC>
