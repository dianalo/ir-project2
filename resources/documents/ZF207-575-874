(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Macintosh video editing evolving into beta stageandM;Macintosh-based video editing systems represent a leap forward in low-cost TVproduction -- if they work.andM;Avid/1 Media Composer from Avid Technology of Burlington, Mass., and Midasfrom Seehorn Technologies of San Jose, Calif., got a warm reception from TVindustry professionals at the National Association of Broadcast convention inApril, and both systems have since been beta tested at independent TVstudios.andM;The prognosis is good.andP;  &quot;We've had the Midas for the past four months, andour opinion is positive,&quot; said George Dyke, president of Oasis Telefacilitiesin Toronto.andP;  Oasis has purchased both Midas and Avid/1 as Mac solutions tooff-linem or rough-cut, video editing, but Dyke said Avid will be used as ahigh-end machine and the Midas machine as a complement to the basic editcontroller.andM;Companies like Oasis provide services to video producers by renting outediting rooms for either on-line editing (direct electronic editing of mastertapes) or off-line editing (editing a rough cut using duplicates of themaster).andP;  Linear off-line editing to a tape machine with one edit controllercan cost $25 per hour, while non-linear or random access editing using laservideodiscs and a sophisticated edit controller costs $300 to $500 per hour.andM;Compression techniques allow Avid/I to store two hours of motion video withtwo channels of 16-bit digital sound on five hard drives with a total of 4.2Gbytes.andP;  This makes it possible to construct an edited sequence pictoriallyin eight-bit color motion video on a Mac terminal.andP;  At $50,000, the systemsoffers random access video editng with speed rivaling the Montage PictureProcessor or the CMX-6000, two far more expensive random access systems thatwork with footage transferred to optical videodiscs.andM;Midas doesn't store entire video sequences but provides black-and-whitestills of the first and last frames of a desired sequence with time codenumbers on screen.andP;  Since these are required to match edit points, thepictures are a plus for users familiar with computerized editing based ontime code numbers alone.andP;  Shot selection on the Midas is thus quicker andmore accurate for less than $10,000.andM;Midas takes a film-style approach, while Avid's display simulates the buttonson videotape recorders.andP;  Both products claim editing accuracy to a singleframe, databases that allow easy cataloging of scenes and shots, as well asthe ability to generate an edit decision list (EDL) compatible with the CMXstandard used in broadcast television.andM;At Oasis, Midas runs on a Mac II with 4 Mbytes of RAM, which Dyke said hebelieves is a minimum requirement, and needs a 40-Mbyte hard disk.andP;  Dyke saidthat the first round of beta software had some problems, including lag incommand time and difficulties in grabbing still frames.andP;  Both problems werecorrected in a later version.andP;  He said he expects operations to improvefurther if Seehorn adopts a newer version of ACIUS' 4th Dimension databasefor edit lists.andM;The only fault Dyke said he sees in Midas is that &quot;it's primarily a videosystem and does not really address audio, at least in the First Cut mode.andO;You only have capacity to cut audio in Fine Cut mode,&quot; he said.andP;  On Fine Cut,he added, &quot;Midas works exceptionally well.&quot;andM;Most impressive, according to Dyke, is that its software can drive virtuallyevery make or model of video recorder.andP;  Midas controls video recorders sowell that it can be used to directly edit master videotapes as if it were aconventional edit controller, Dyke said.andP;  &quot;We're doing it here throughMulti-Finder on two Betacam recorders,&quot; he said.andP;  He did point out that thenine-pin connnector requires an additional &quot;translator box&quot; to drive SuperVHS recorders, an inexpensive video format that is increasingly being used.andM;Dyke said he purchased the Avid/I instead of a CMX-6000 to give his facilitya competitive edge to attract more broadcast TV cliehts &quot;We bought the Avidto address a certain segment of the production market,&quot; he said, &quot;theHollywood community of producers used to editing sitcoms on disc-based editsystems at places like LaserEdit in Los Angeles.&quot;andM;Oasis began beta testing the Avid in June, and Dyke said he foreseesinsufficient storage capacity as the system's biggest hurdle.andM;&quot;You need five drives to store two hours of video, and that's not a lot whenediting a half-hour TV show,&quot; said Dyke.andP;  He said that storing the hugeamount of footage within the system limits the machine's use to a singleproject, somewhat affecting a studio's ability to make a profit on systemrentals.andP;  &quot;Conventional edit systems can accommodate projects of severalproducers during a given day by simply switching tape reels or cassettes.&quot;andM;&quot;This is a problem, and they know it,&quot; said Alan Miler, vice president ofpost-production for Rebo Studio of New York, a beta site for Avid/I sinceApril.andP;  Rebo uses a Mac IIx and seven 600-Mbyte disk drives, providing atwo-hour capacity.andP;  Miller said, &quot;We're using it for in-house projects andfor commercials.andP;  You can fit [raw footage for] four commercials on thesystem.&quot;andM;Much of the video work that Rebo does is in the high-definition (HDTV)ll25/60 video format.andP;  The Avid system won't be required to compress an HDTVsignal because &quot;it's our usual practice to down-convert HDTV to NTSC(National Television System Committee) standard for all our off-line work,&quot;said Miller.andP;  He said he considers the machine &quot;95 percent done&quot; and that itis saving the production company money.andM;&quot;It replaces our getting a laser disc edit system, which would be moreexpensive,&quot; Miller said.andP;  Costs for transferring raw footage for an hour-longTV special to laser discs can cost as much as $14,000, he said.andM;Ad executive Peter Farago has yet another application for the Avid/1.andP;  Havingformed his own agency six months ago, he's using his beta system, installedin July, to create sound-and-motion story boards.andM;&quot;Usually when you're doing a story board you assemble materials fromdrawings, from existing commercials, from soundtracks,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You showthe client a piece of paper and hum the soundtrack.andP;  With the Avid/I, youtake these elements and create an idea in motion, with real sound, and passthat on from story board to a finished production.andP;  No steps are wasted.&quot;andO;Farago said that the ability to realize a concept on computer keeps thecreator from being distanced from execution of work heretofore jobbed out toan assortment of artists and production people (see &quot;The bottom line todesktop video,&quot; MacWEEK, Aug. 8).andM;Other beta sites include Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios and SteveMichelson Productions in San Francisco.andM;The Avid/1 basic package will include a Mac IIx with 5 Mbytes of RAM and twocolor display monitors for less than $50,000.andP;  A configuration with 4 Gbytesof disk storage will cost about $80,000.andM;Seehorn Technologies offers the Midas I through Julian Systems of Concord,Calif.andP;  The Edit Worx version from Julian provides video control boards,software for cataloging and First Cut as well as Final Cut for auto-assembly.andO;Midas II, which adds Fine Cut as well as budgeting and story boardingsoftware, will cost about $15,000.andM;More marketing muscle for the Midas is likely to come from Pinnacle Systems,a Santa Clara, Calif., company that has a highly successful line of digitalvideo gear based on the IBM PC.andP;  Having &quot;licensed this product from Seehorn,along with the rights to develop it further,&quot; according to Mark Gray,Pinnacle vice president, the company's versions -- with additional VTRcontrols such as single-frame jog and a slightly different terminal display-- will be sold as Video Workshop, a rough-cut editor, for $7,500; VideoWorkshop II, a five-cut editor, will retail for $12,500.andP;  Price does notinclude a Mac but is likely to offer interfaces to Pinnacle's other products,which range from a paint system to 3-D digital effects.andP;  &quot;Ebery product wemake is going to be on both platforms, IBM and Mac,&quot; Gray said.andP;  Asoftware-only package for shot cataloging and list management will sell for$1,000.andM;Meanwhile, competiton for the hearts, minds and wallets of video makers isongoing.andP;  Also at the National Association of Broadcasters convention,Advanced Remote Technologies Inc. (ARTIe of Campbell, Calif., demonstrated anoff-line edit controller based on HyperCard.andP;  Providing no pictures onterminals, it is nevertheless CMX-compatible, with high-end list managementfeatures.andM;&quot;I admire those who are trying to put the power of a Montage into a $20,000or $50,000 machine,&quot; said ARTI founder Kevin Welsh.andP;  &quot;We've got a Mac-basedsystem that will handle three recorders for $5,000.&quot;andP;  All three products willbe available by the third quarter.andM;ARTI can be reached at (408) 374-9044; Avid Technology Inc. at (617)272-1680; Seehorn Technologies Inc. at (408) 998-7961; Pinnacle Systems at(408) 970-9787.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
