(NFI), Seafreeze Ltd.,Mayflower International Ltd., Lunds Fisheries, Inc., and Nantucket SoundFish Weirs, Inc.<T3>Comment:</T3> Blue Water Fish Tackle Co. commented that there shouldbe no directed foreign fishing on squids, mackerel, or butterfish in theExclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) because these species are needed to sustainpopulations of large ocean pelagics such as tuna, swordfish, and billfish.<T3>Response:</T3> There is no directed foreign fishing proposed for squidsand butterfish. Therefore, the response will address foreign fishing forAtlantic mackerel only. Large oceanic pelagics such as tuna, swordfish, and billfish are knownto feed on a variety of species. For instance, sampling of swordfish stomachcontents reveal herring, menhaden, bluefish, silver hake, argentine, andrattails, as well as several species of squids, mackerels, and butterfish.Another investigation identified 28 types of food items that were consumedby sailfish. Although large pelagics are known to feed on Atlantic mackerel,they are opportunistic, feeding on a wide variety of species, and not dependenton any particular one. Predator-prey relationships are particularly complex and are not amongthe factors considered in setting the Atlantic mackerel IOY. However, maintenanceof a spawning stock size of 600,000 mt is central to the allocation process.NMFS biologists estimate that the current condition of the stock wouldallow 200,000 mt of Atlantic mackerel to be removed from the stock andstill maintain a total stock size of over one million mt. The 30,000 mtallocated for TALFF, if harvested, is not likely to adversely affect theAtlantic mackerel stock or reduce it to a point where large pelagics wouldbe affected. <T3>Comment:</T3> RNE, Scan Ocean, Inc., and the PPR commented that theproposed TALLF and JVP amounts for Atlantic mackerel are substantiallylower than the amounts requested by foreign nationals, and lower than thatwhich was available in 1988. The low amounts make planning fishing operationsdifficult because it appears the amounts requested will not be available.The commenters believe that TALFF and JVP levels should be raised to accommodatethe applications submitted by the Netherlands and Poland. <T3>Response:</T3> Atlantic mackerel TALFF and JVP are components of IOYand are not set directly in relation to amounts requested in foreign fishingapplications. IOY is to provide maximum benefits to the United States.The basis for setting IOY is described in the proposed rule published onOctober 28, 1988. It is expected that maximum net benefits will be derivedthis year from the purchase requirements of joint venture and processedproduct associated with allocations of TALFF. <T3>Comment:</T3> The RNE requested confirmation that the difference betweenthe Atlantic mackerel ABC and IOY (330,000 mt minus 74,000 mt) could bemade available to the foreign fleets. The RNE requested that considerationbe given to the fact that fleet owners must make their fishing plans wellin advance of actual fishing operations, and need to know the quantitieswhich are actually available. <T3>Response:</T3> Thirty thousand mt of TALFF and 10,000 mt of JVP areavailable to foreign fleets to begin the 1989 fishing year. However, regulationsfor the Atlantic mackerel, squid, and butterfish fisheries provide thatthe IOY may be adjusted by the Regional Director, in consultation withthe Council, at any time during the fishing year. The basis for adjustmentmust either be that U.S. fishermen will exceed the initial DAH or thatan adjustment will produce maximum net benefits to the United States. Giventhe likelihood that the domestic fishery will not exceed DAH this year,any increase in benefits to the United States from the 1989 Atlantic mackerelfishery would, for the most part, result from the required purchase ratiosof 3,000 mt of JVP and 1,000 mt of U.S. processed product for every 9,000mt of TALFF (9:3 and 1 policy). Any inseason adjustments to TALFF willdepend largely on the performance of the foreign fleet, as measured byadherance to the 9:3 and 1 policy. <T3>Comment:</T3> RNE, PPR, Lunds and Scan Ocean commented that the 9:3and 1 policy is unachievable and cost prohibitive. Scan Ocean commentedthat it will have to renegotiate with its foreign partners because originalnegotiations for the joint venture were predicated on a policy of 9:3 or1. <T3>Response:</T3> The policy requiring joint venture purchase and processedproduct purchase was announced to the industry in the final rule settingthe specifications for 1988. This was accomplished via a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice on Debember 11, 1987 (52 FR 47034), specificallyto provide the industry with advance notice. The 9:3 and 1 policy is intendedto promote the development of the domestic mackerel fishery by encouragingthe participation of U.S. harvesters and processors. Five foreign fishingapplications for the 1989 Atlantic mackerel fishery were received, twoof which comply closely with the 9:3 and 1 policy. This indicates thatsome consider the ventures to be economically viable. These applicationswill be given preference in allocation decisions. <T3>Comment:</T3> Scan Ocean, Inc. and Lund's Fisheries, Inc., commentedthat the option to sell over-the-side to foreign vessels is essential tothe Atlantic mackerel fishery because there is not enough shoreside capacityor interest on the part of U.S. processors to handle the large volume necessaryto market this low-priced species profitably. <T3>Response:</T3> An IOY has been established which provides for 10,000mt of JVP to be made available for the 1989 fishing year. This amount isin proportion to the available TALFF according to the 9:3 and 1 policy.However, since JVP provides more benefits to the United States than foreigndirected fishing, applications requesting additional JVP without TALFF,may justify an adjustment to the IOY to increase JVP. In addition, theTALFF and JVP can be increased consistent with performance against theratios noted above. <T3>Comment:</T3> NFI commented that the same processing capacity existsfor <T3>Illex</T3>, as well as <T3>Loligo</T3> squid and, therefore, there should be no JVP for <T3>Illex</T3> squid as there is none for <T3>Loligo</T3> squid. NFI further commented that an allocation of <T3>Illex</T3> squid JVP conflicts with the FMP goal of full U.S. developmentof the squid fishery and frustrates U.S. marketing efforts. <T3>Response:</T3> As stated in the final rule implementing the 1988 specificationsMarch 4, 1988 (53 FR 6991), despite the considerable capacity of the U.S.freezer trawler fleet and U.S shoreside facilities, the availability ofhigher priced species makes <T3>Illex</T3> squid a less desirable species to U.S. processors.<ITAG tagnum="54">The </ITAG><T3>Illex</T3> squid fishery does not appear to be at the point of developmentwhere U.S. interests will process all of the DAH. In 1988, U.S. processorsutilized only 1,941 mt of the available 14,000 mt of <T3>Illex</T3> squid. Foreign processors can provide the necessary marketoutlet for joint venture produced <T3>Illex</T3> squid.<T3>Comment:</T3> Seafreeze, Inc. asked several questions regarding <T3>Illex</T3> squid and Atlantic mackerel JVP and TALFF levels. They areas follows:1. Given increases in U.S. processing capacity, how will an <T3>Illex</T3> squid JVP level of 3,000 mt be in the best interest of theU.S. industry, particularly in view of competition with domestic product?How many wet boats will be able to participate in this joint venture, andwhat will be the level of financial return to the industry and the economy?Will this level exceed that which would be generated if 3,000 mt were harvested,processed, and marketed by a domestic shoreside facility?<T3>Response:</T3> As mentioned above, it is not capacity alone which isconsidered in setting the DAP. It is the capacity and the intent of theU.S. industry to process the DAH that forms the basis of DAP determination.Despite considerable harvesting/processing capacity, the United Statesproduced very little <T3>Illex</T3> squid in 1988. Although it is recognized that 3,000 mt ofJVP <T3>Illex</T3> squid may compete in the world market with U.S. processedproduct, this amount will provide a much needed economic benefit to thefleet of small ``wet'' boats that do traditionally fish for <T3>Illex</T3> squid. Some U.S. fishermen report that, for the time being,the competition provided by foreign joint ventures ensures them a betterprice. It is unknown how many U.S. boats will participate or whether therewill be a joint venture; however, testimony at the public hearing heldby the Council in August, 1988, indicated a considerable interest existsfor joint ventures from New York/New Jersey area fishermen.The Congress, in passing an amendment to the Magnuson Fishery Conservationand Management Act in 1978 (Pub. L. 95-354), clearly intended that U.S.fishermen have the option of selling fish to foreign processors if U.S.processors did not have the capacity and intent to utilize it. The followingis quoted from the <T3>Congressional Record:</T3> ``The amount of U.S. harvested fish whichwill not be processed by U.S. fish processors will be available for immediatesale to foreign fish processors.''The price differential between shoreside processed and joint venture produced<T3>Illex</T3> squid depends upon a variety of factors. Generally speaking,shoreside processing should provide the greatest economic return. However,to date, U.S. processors have not utilized the entire DAH, and therefore,joint ventures remain an alternative.2. How will an <T3>Illex</T3> squid JVP level of 3,000 mt stimulate market developmentfor U.S. product when it will not be marketed as domestic product?<T3>Response:</T3> The <T3>Illex</T3> squid JVP level of 3,000 mt is not necessarily intendedto stimulate market development for U.S. product. This amount representsthe portion of DAH that U.S. processors are not expected to utilize duringthe 1989 fishing year. This provides a potential economic benefit to thenation by allowing domestic harvesters an opportunity to market productthey would not otherwise be able to sell shoreside. There is no indicationthat a 3,000 mt JVP will hinder market development for U.S. product.3. What criteria will be utilized to ensure that foreign partners engagedin <T3>Illex</T3> squid JVP will properly handle the product, which has beena problem in the past?<T3>Response:</T3> There are no criteria employed by NMFS to ensure thatforeign partners properly handle the product once it is received over-the-sidefrom U.S. vessels. When a product is purchased, the owner has exclusivecontrol of that product.4. How will TALFF and JVP for mackerel stimulate the domestic industry,given the domination of the world market by foreign fleets (and resultinglow world market price) and the decreasing interest by domestic fishermento participate in joint ventures?<T3>Response: </T3>This comment was made and responded to in the publicationof the final specifications for 1988. That response is repeated below:``The U.S. Atlantic mackerel fishery is underutilized due to the limitedmarket for export. The Council's policy is to foster growth in this fisherythe same way as it did the squid and butterfish fisheries. That is, bydeveloping export markets for U.S. product by offering, for a time, TALFFand JVP as an inducement toward the purchase of U.S. processed product.The Atlantic mackerel TALFF and JVP allocations provide benefits to theUnited States in several ways. First, the requirement of a JV purchasefor TALFF provides U.S. harvesters at least a temporary market for theirproduct. Second, U.S. processors have a market for 1 mt of their productfor every 9 mt of TALFF allocated, a potential sale of 10,000 mt this year.It is hoped that U.S. product will thereby gain a foothold in the marketplace.Finally, the United States gains revenues from fees collected from foreignnations fishing in the EEZ''.5. What criteria will be utilized in evaluating applications for mackerelTALFF?<T3>Response: </T3>Criteria used to evaluate applications for mackerelTALFF include consideration of the 9:3 and 1 policy, as well as the criteriaoutlined under section 201(e)(1)(E) of the Magnuson Act. In addition, considerationwas given to decreasing the impact on marine mammals that may occur inassociation with the mackerel fishery.6. How all NMFS gauge compliance with mackerel purchase requirements? Howwill NMFS verify that U.S. processed mackerel is or is not available andhow will the price be determined?<T3>Response: </T3>Compliance with the joint venture purchase requirementsare monitored by the Northeast Region Foreign Fishery Observer Program.One hundred percent observer coverage is maintained aboard every foreignvessel.Compliance with purchase requirements have in the past been difficult todetermine. Currently, the Regional Director is considering whether to requireforeign partners to produce a bill of lading to document processed productpurchases prior to release of additional TALFF.7. The <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 43741, October 28, 1988) states, ``TheCouncil's policy for development of U.S. fisheries has been to stimulategrowth and investment on the domestic side with a concurrent phasing-outof foreign participation. Maximum benefits have been provided to U.S. fishinginterests by application of this policy to the <T3>Loligo</T3> squid and butterfish fisheries. The Council proposes tofollow the same course in developing the Atlantic mackerel fishery.'' However,it should be noted that foreign participation in the butterfish fisherywas ended in a very short time frame. Please explain the similarity betweenthese two fisheries and the mackerel fishery (including world market trendsand conditions; global stock distributions and importance). In view ofany potentially significant difference, can this same policy be appliedto the mackerel fishery and provide maximum benefits to U.S. fishery interests?<T3>Response: </T3>TALFF and JVP for the butterfish fishery was reducedto bycatch levels when U.S. processors demonstrated the capacity and intentto utilize the entire DAH, which was determined to equal IOY. As explainedin response to comments above, the Atlantic mackerel fishery has not achievedthe level of development where U.S. processors and harvesters can utilizethe entire IOY. Analysis of economic considerations, including world marketconditions, can be obtained from the Council (see ADDRESS).<T3>Comment:</T3> Nantucket Sound Fish Weirs, Inc. commented that Atlanticmackerel TALFF should be reduced to zero in order to increase demand forU.S. produced mackerel. This commenter advocates applying the same strategyto the development of the mackerel fishery as was used for the <T3>Loligo</T3> squid fishery.<T3>Response: </T3>The Council's policy for developing the mackerel fisheryis to follow the same course followed for <T3>Loligo</T3> squid. However, the domestic mackerel fishery has not reachedthe point where maximum benefits to the United States would be derivedfrom a zero level of TALFF. Meanwhile, TALFF and associated JVP purchasesprovide an economic benefit to some U.S. processors and harvesters.In addition, the Atlantic mackerel stock is considered underfished to thepoint where the individual growth rate is inhibited due to density-dependentfactors and it has become advisable, from a biological standpoint, to reducethe population by fishing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>This action is authorized by 50 CFR Part 655 and complies with E.O. 12291.<ITAG tagnum="20">(16 U.S.C. 1801 </ITAG><T3>et seq.</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 655</ITAG>Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
