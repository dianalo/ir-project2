In a letter sent yesterday to the leaders of theHouse-Senate conference committee, Rep. John Dingell (D.,Mich.) and Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), President Bush said,&quot;I fear that the slow progress and apparent course of theconference committee may jeopardize enactment of thiscritically important legislation.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   So far, the administration has had little influence in thedeliberations, which have produced just one major accord sofar: an agreement on curbing industrial sources of smog thatthe administration considers too stringent. The president'sproposal, which accompanied the letter and contained elementsfrom both bills, marked both an effort to spur the slow talksand avoid blame if the negotiations fail to produce a bill inthe remaining weeks of the congressional session.   &quot;It was the president's initial bill and his agreementwith Senate that got the ball 90 yards down the field,&quot; saidthe presidential domestic-policy assistant, Roger Porter,using a football metaphor that three other administrationofficials also employed yesterday. &quot;Now we're trying tofigure how to get the ball the last 10 yards.&quot;   Responding to the letter, Rep. Dingell and Sen. Baucuseach emphasized his intention to pass a strong bill thisyear. Rep. Dingell added that &quot;I'm sorry they didn't get theletter to us when the House and Senate passed versions of theClean-Air Act four months ago before Memorial Day.&quot;   Mr. Porter said the administration's compromise would costindustry between $22 billion and $23 billion in the year2005, when its provisions would be fully in effect. That'sless than the $25.4 billion price tag for the Senate andHouse bills, according to the latest White House estimate.   Among other points, the White House proposal calls foradopting the Senate's acid-rain provisions. Although bothbills would reduce annual sulfur-dioxide emissions by 10billion tons from 1980 levels, administration officialscontend that the Senate provisions would be more workable.   The administration also prefers a controversial Senateapproach for reducing the cancer risk that remains for nearbyresidents after factories have applied the best availabletechnology to curb harmful emissions. On reformulatedgasoline, which would be required to be sold in the smoggiestcities, the compromise takes provisions from both bills, withmodifications designed to reduce costs and increaseflexibility for industry.   The White House also is urging the conferees to adoptSenate language on industrial smog rather than the alreadyaccepted House provisions. It also reiterated its oppositionto a provision designed to provide financial assistance toworkers who lose their jobs as a result of this legislation.Officials have said adoption of this provision could prompt aveto.</TEXT></DOC>
