The rule was precipitated by legislationcontained in Title II, Subtitle B of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1987, Pub. L. 100-242, approved February 5, 1988 (1987 Act). Theinformation collection requirements contained in this interim rule wereapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980.Subsequently, on May 20 and July 14, 1988, the Department issued administrativeguidance pertaining to the requirement in the interim rule that an ownerfile a Notice of Intent to Prepay, and a Plan of Action. (These memorandaare published in their entirety in an Appendix to this Notice).In order to assess whether a project owner's request for prepayment satisfiesthe requirements of the 1987 Act, the July 14, 1988 memorandum asked thatowners seeking to prepay provide more information in the Plan of Actionthan had been requested in the interim rule (<T3>see</T3> Items 5 (a) and (b), and 7-10 of the July 14, 1988 memoranda).These additional requirements were not submitted to OMB for review andapproval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and consequently did not displayan approved OMB control number.In addition, the Department's May 20, 1988 memorandum included a sampleform entitled, ``Owner's Notice of Intent to Prepay.'' This form, althoughapproved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, failed to display theapproved OMB control number and expiration date.On October 5, 1988, HUD representatives met with officials from OMB todiscuss these unapproved information collection requirements. As a resultof this meeting, the following actions were agreed to:1. Property owners who have already submitted a Plan of Action for reviewunder the 1987 prepayment legislation will be notified by HUD that, pendingOMB approval, they are not required to submit information in response toitems 5 (a) and (b) and 7-10 contained in the July 14, 1988 memorandum,and that they may withdraw such information if they choose to do so.2. The Department is submitting to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act(44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) an expedited request for approval of the informationcollection requirements contained in the July 14, 1988 administrative instructions.Because of the statutory 60-day approval deadline for prepayments underthe 1987 Act, OMB approval of these requirements has been requested withinthe next two weeks.3. The public is advised that the public reporting burden for these collectionsof information is estimated to average 100 hours per response, includingthe time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information.This Notice lists the folllowing information: (1) The title of the informationcollection proposal; (2) the office of the agency to collect the information;(3) the description of the need for the information and its proposed use;(4) the agency form number, if applicable; (5) what members of the publicwill be affected by the proposal; (6) how frequently information submissionswill be required; (7) an estimate of the total number of hours needed toprepare the information submission including number of respondents, frequencyof response, and hours of response; (8) whether the proposal is new oran extension, reinstatement, or revision of an information collection requirement;and (9) the names and telephone numbers of an agency official familiarwith the proposal and of the OMB Desk Officer for the Department.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3507; Section 7(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act,42 U.S.C. 3535(d).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Samuel R.

This final rule sets forth HUD's procedures governing the prepaymentof an insured multifamily mortgage by an owner of low income housing. Therule gives regulatory effect to legislative provisions governing prepaymentof HUD-insured mortgages that are contained in Title II of the Housingand Urban Development Act of 1987, entitled ``Preservation of Low IncomeHousing.'' Congress enacted these provisions as an interim measure to assurethat affordable multifamily housing units are preserved to the maximumextent practicable for lower-income families, and that displacement ofsuch families is minimized, while the public and private sectors work togetherto find long term remedies to the potential loss of affordable housing.The sections of this legislation governing prepayment, and the final rulewill be replaced two years after the date of enactment of this legislation,but will have no effect on action taken or authorized prior to such repeal.2. In enacting Title II, ``Preservation of Low Income Housing,'' Congressmade a number of findings leading to the conclusion that these interimmeasures are ``needed to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low income housingand irrevocable displacement of current tenants.'' Congress has determinedthat in the next 15 years, more than 330,000 low income housing units insuredunder section 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act could be lostas a result of the termination of low income affordability restrictions,and that in the next decade more than 465,000 low income housing unitsproduced with assistance under Section 8 of the United States Housing Actof 1937 could be lost as a result of the expiration of the rental assistancecontracts executed between project owners and HUD.An owner of eligible low income housing, therefore, will no longer be ableto prepay a mortgage unless the prepayment is first approved by HUD. HUDwill only approve a prepayment in accordance with an acceptable plan ofaction submitted by the owner that discusses the impact of the proposedprepayment on the future use of the involved units and on the lower incometenants. If HUD determines that a mortgage cannot be prepaid, it can stillagree to give the owner certain financial incentives to keep the mortgagein place, provided that the incentive is necessary to provide a fair returnon the investment of the owner, is cost effective to the Federal Government,and meets statutory criteria designed to protect tenants.If the project owner and HUD reach preliminary agreement on the terms ofa plan of action, the owner will prepare a summary of these terms. UponHUD's approval of the summary, the owner will send a copy of the summaryto each tenant in the project, and will post a copy of the summary in eachoccupied building in the project. The summary will notify tenants thatthey have 30 calendar days to submit any comments to HUD who shall takesuch comments into account before giving final approval to the plan ofaction.This new rule governing prepayments reflects provisions mandated by Congressand appears in a new part of the Code of Federal Regulations, 24 CFR Part248.3. Information is submitted on a project-by-project basis with no considerationbeing given to the use of improved information technology to reduce burdens.Further this information collection is not amenable to improved informationtechnology because it is unique to the projects to which it applies. Thisfinal rule will largely reflect provisions mandated by statute and thatfrequently does not provide for agency discretion.4. Each submission is unique to a particular project and, therefore, thepossibility of duplication is almost nonexistent. In reviewing the regulation,however, we are assured that there are no unnecessary duplications therein.5. Similar information that can be used or modified is not available.6. Not applicable.7. This legislation contains a provision for the repeal of this same sectiongoverning prepayment two years from the date of enactment of this legislation,at which time the final rule will also be repealed. Congress enacted theseprovisions as an interim measure to assure that affordable multifamilyhousing units are preserved to the maximum extent practicable for lower-incomefamilies, and that displacement of such families is minimized, while thepublic and private sectors work together to find long term responses tothe potential loss of affordable housing. The final rule largely reflectsprovisions mandated by statute and that frequently does not provide foragency discretion.8. There are no special circumstances requiring the collection of informationthat is inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.69. The interim rule invited interested persons to submit comments on theprocedures governing its implementation, and revised its final regulationbased on the comments submitted. The Department evaluated the commentsin an effort to assist Congress in ultimately establishing long term measuresfor assuring the existence of an adequate supply of affordable low-incomehousing units.10. There are no assurances of confidentiality provided to the respondents.The information collected is not considered confidential.11. There are no questions being asked that are of a sensitive nature.12. Estimates of annualized cost to the Federal Government and respondents.It is estimated that it will cost the respondent and the government approximately$15.00 per hour including overhead and support staff.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>8,L1,tp0,i1,s10,4,1,5,1,4,1,7 </C> <H1> </H1><H1>Total responses</H1><H1> </H1><H1>Hours/response</H1><H1> </H1><H1>Cost/hour</H1><H1> </H1><H1>Annual cost</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Respondents<D>120</D><D/>andmultiply;<D>100</D><D/>andmultiply;<D>$15</D><D/>=<D>$180,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Government<D>120</D><D/>andmultiply;<D>40</D><D/>andmultiply;<D>15</D><D/>=<D>72,000</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>252,000</D></ITAG>13. It is further estimated that it will take each project owner 100 hoursto complete all of its responsibilities for each project, and the FederalGovernment 40 hours to complete its responsibilities. The length of timerequired for these functions is based on the experience of Field Officestaff and of Headquarters staff who had previously worked in a Field Office.The project owner will, in the 100 hours time period, file a Notice ofIntent, prepare a Plan of Action that includes all of the information requiredby HUD to make an intelligent and valid evaluation, make necessary revisionsto the Plan of Action, and negotiate with HUD regarding any possible incentivesextended by HUD. The time and expense also includes notification to tenantswhen the project owner and HUD have reached preliminary agreement on theterms of the Plan of Action, and the cost and time necessary for duplication,mailing and posting of the summary of the agreement, as well as the costand time involved in reviewing any comments received.In addition to the information specifically required by the regulation;further information determined by the Commissioner to be necessary whenmaking valid evaluations and determinations to meet the statutory testfor prepayment have also been included as a requirement in the owner'sPlan of Action. This information includes: 1. A protection plan to be providedby the owner for very low, low, and moderate income tenants when relocationis necessary (8 hours), 2. an independent market analysis or appraisalof the area providing the specific information requested in the Plan ofAction (44 hours), 3. project operating statements (2 hours), 4. a descriptionof any outstanding findings of noncompliance (2 hours), and 5. any otherinformation enabling the owner to show that the criteria can be met (4hours).This additional 60 hours is included in the previously mentioned 100 hoursnecessary to complete all of the project owner's responsibilities for eachproject actually prepaid, or where there is an attempt to prepay.The Department must review the Plan of Action for form and content, notifythe project owner of any deficiencies in the Plan of Action along withrecommendations to correct the deficiencies, be available to negotiateterms of any incentives with the owner, and provide incentives where appropriate.14. This information collection is the result of the implementation ofnew statutory requirements. This information has not previously been collectedin this format. While it is estimated that 297 projects will be eligiblefor prepayment by the end of 1989, the Department has determined that only25 percent or 75 projects will actually prepay or attempt to prepay. Beingcautious, however, this request for OMB approval indicates that 40 percentor 120 projects will prepay or attempt to prepay.15. The information is not being collected for statistical use and willnot be published.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>10,L1,i1,s100,12,1,12,1,12,1,12,1,12</C><T4>Plan of Action_Tabulation of Annual Reporting Burden Preservation ofLow-Income Housing_</T4>24<T4> CFR Part </T4>248<H1>Description of information collection/Applicable program reference</H1><H1>Number of Respondents</H1><H1>x</H1><H1>Responses per Respondent</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Total Annual Responses</H1><H1>x</H1><H1>Hours per response</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Total Hours</H1>A protection plan provided by the owner for very low, low and moderateincome tenants:<ITAG tagnum="3">a. when relocation necessary</ITAG><D>120</D><D> </D><D>1</D><D> </D><D>120</D><D> </D><D>4</D><D> </D><D>480</D><ITAG tagnum="3">b. to maintain current rent structure</ITAG><D>120</D><D> </D><D>1</D><D> </D><D>120</D><D> </D><D>4</D><D> </D><D>480</D><ITAG tagnum="1">An independent market analysis or appraisal of the area providing thespecific information requested in the Plan of Action<D>120</D><D> </D><D>1</D><D> </D><D>120</D><D> </D><D>44</D><D> </D><D>5280</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Project operating statement<D>120</D><D> </D><D>1</D><D> </D><D>120</D><D> </D><D>2</D><D> </D><D>240</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A description of outstanding findings of noncompliance<D>120</D><D> </D><D>1</D><D> </D><D>120</D><D> </D><D>2</D><D> </D><D>240</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Any other information enabling the owner to show that the criteriacan be met<D>120</D><D> </D><D>1</D><D> </D><D>120</D><D> </D><D>4</D><D> </D><D>480</D><R>n,n,n,n,n,n,s,s,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> 60</D><D> </D><D>7200</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">May 20, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Memorandum for : All Regional Administrators; Directors of RegionalHousing; Managers, Category A, B and C Offices; Directors, Housing ManagementDivision; Loan Management and Assisted Housing Management Branch Chiefs;Valuation Branch Chiefs; and Area Economic and Market Analysts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">From: Thomas T.

BackgroundOn February 5, 1988, The President signed the <T3>Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. </T3>Title II, SubtitleB of the Act, entitled: ``Preservation of Low-Income Housing'', providesthat an owner of eligible low-income housing is precluded from prepayingthe mortgage on such housing unless first approved by HUD. It further providesthat HUD cannot approve a prepayment without an acceptable ``plan of action'',submitted by the owner, that dicusses the impact of such proposed prepaymenton the future use of the involved housing units on lower income tenants.This legislation also contains a provision for the repeal of Subtitle Bon February 5, 1990. Congress enacted these provisions as an interim measure to establish criterianeeded to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low-income housing and the irrevocabledisplacement of current tenants, while the public and private sectors worktogether to find long-term respones to the potential loss of affordablehousing. HUD published an Interim Rule on April 5, 1988, implementing the legislativeprovisions. The effective date for the rule is May 20, 1988. (<T3>Exhibit 1</T3>; 53 FR 11224).C. Dates<T3>Effective Date: </T3>May 20, 1988.<T3>Expiration Date:</T3> Febraury 5, 1990, except for certain actions,as otherwise indicated herein.D. Applicability<T3>Eligible Low Income Housing</T3>_housing financed by a mortgage thatis:1. Insured or Held by the Commissioner under Part 221(d)(3) <T3>and</T3> assisted under Rent Supplement or Part 880, 881, or 886;2. Insured or Held by the Commissioner under Part 221(d)(3) Below MarketInterest Rate;3. Insured, assisted, or Held by the Commissioner, under Part 236, andsubject to a regulatory agreement;4. A purchase money mortgage held by the Commissioner where, immediatelyprior to HUD's acquisition, would have been classified under paragraphs1, 2, or 3 above;and<T3>Where,</T3> by regulation or contract in effect <T3>before </T3>such mortgage <T3>is</T3> or [within one year from the date of the owner's Notice ofIntent to prepay] <T3>would become eligible </T3>for prepayment <T3>without the prior approval of the Commissioner.</T3> At this time, HUD will not accept or process Notices of Intent or Plansof Action for projects which are not eligible to prepay by February 4,1990. E. Program Administration<ITAG tagnum="81">General</ITAG>HUD will approve prepayment of an eligible mortgage where the owner providesan acceptable ``plan of action'', and such plan is approved by HUD. A mortgagee <T3>cannot accept prepayment </T3>without HUD's prior approval. To do so,is grounds for administrative action and legal remedies. HUD may consult with and enter into agreements with local governments toimplement Owners' plans of action and/or State strategies where such havebeen found acceptable and approved by HUD. A sequence of steps and actions involved in the prepayment of a mortgageis set forth in the Prepayment Processing Flow Chart (<T3>Exhibit 2). </T3>Each of these steps is described in detail withinthis package, with instructions for the individual processes and time framesfor completion. Generally, HUD will attempt to make a final determination on a <T3>plan of action </T3>well in advance of the required 300 days from thetime of completion, initial receipt. If HUD determines that a mortgage cannot be prepaid, HUD may agree to certainfinancial incentives to keep the mortgage in place or to maintain long-termaffordability restrictions, or a combination thereof.

Background:</T3> On May 20, 1988, the Department issued guidanceand direction pertaining to prepayment in general and specific, step-by-stepprocedures for an Owner's Notice of Intent to prepay a multifamily mortgagepursuant to Title II, subtitled B of the <T3>Housing and Community Development Act of 1987,</T3> and HUD's InterimRule implementing these legislative provisions.

Compliance:</T3> Upon receipt of an Owner's Notice of Intent, FieldOffices must act to follow the procedures outlined, herein. All actionsare time-critical, as mandated by statute.<T3>Note:</T3> Notice of Intent is first subject to review and processas outlined in the May 20, 1988 Exhibit 3-Notice of Intent to Prepay.If you have questions or need further clarification or guidance with respectto this Exhibit and its content, contact Jim Tahash or Barbara Hunter inthe Planning and Procedures Divisions, on FTS 426-3944.Exhibit 4_Plan of Action<ITAG tagnum="81">Important_Loan Management Branch Chiefs</ITAG>These are the processing instructions for an Owner's Plan of Action. Theyhave been written for Field Office use only.There are three (3) attachments to this Exhibit:(1) Form Letter to Owners (who have given Notice of Intent);(2) Itemized Time Table; and(3) Standards and Criteria for Approval Involving Termination of AffordabilityRestrictions.The Form Letter to Owners and the <T3>Standards and Criteria for Approval Involving Termination of AffordabilityRestrictions</T3> have been developed for your use in providing Ownerswith the required information. Forward these once you receive a Noticeof Intent to Prepay.<ITAG tagnum="81">General</ITAG>Upon the receipt of an Owner's Notice of Intent of Prepay, the Owner mustbe forwarded the information he/she will need to prepare a Plan of Action.The criteria and standards required to be addressed in the Plan of Actioninvolve prepayment of a mortgage where the low-income affordability restrictionsare terminated. However, in the case where HUD decides that a Plan of Actioninvolving termination of the low-income affordability restrictions wouldnot be approvable, HUD can offer incentives or consolations to extend thelow-income use.   There are five (5) possible results from HUD's review and evaluation ofa Plan of Action: (1) Prepayment will be approved and all low income affordability restrictionswill be terminated_except for the protection of the very low, low and moderateincome tenants in-place;  (2) Prepayment will be approved, but owner will receive incentives to continueuse of the project as low income housing;  (3) Prepayment will not be approved, but owner receives incentives to maintainthe project as low and moderate income housing;  (4) Prepayment will not be approved, but failing to reach agreement (within300 days) on a negotiated Plan of Action, HUD and the Owner will agreeon a package of incentives and restrictions which would modify the regulatoryagreement; or  (5) Prepayment will not be approved, and no incentives will be offered. Any and all Plans of Action where an owner meets the standards and criteriamandated by statute <T3>will </T3>be approved. Plans of Action which propose prepayment andtermination of affordability restrictions are to be analyzed and evaluatedin accordance with the attached <T3>Standards and Criteria for Approval Involving Termination of Low-IncomeAffordability Restrictions. </T3>Any Plans of Action not meeting these criteria may be considered for prepaymentapproval with restrictions; incentives for continuing the use as low andmoderate income housing; etc., as listed above. Owner's must submit a Noticeof Intent to prepay. HUD will not intertain a project that deals only witha request for incentives. Incentives will only be offered where the projecthas a higher and better use than low income housing and where the Ownerhas notified HUD of their Intent to Prepay. A Plan of action is requiredin <T3>all </T3>cases. The Letter to Owners and Standards and Criteria have been developed forproviding Owners with the required information and standards. This packageis attached and is to be sent to an Owner who has submitted a <T3>Notice of Intent to Prepay.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">Plan of Action: </ITAG>Once an Owner receives this package, he/she must prepare to meet and respondto its requirements. No further action is taken by the Field Office untilAn Owner submits the completed <T3>Plan of Action. At that point, </T3>and this is very important, the300 day clock begins_and it is incumbent upon HUD to act and document itsactions in as thorough and expedient a manner possible.

Approval of a Plan of Action that involves termination of low-incomeaffordability restrictions:</ITAG>Based on the content of the Plan of Action, HUD must make findings thatcertain conditions and situations are considered and evaluated. A Planof Action involving termination of low-income affordability restrictionsmust meet the following tests before prepayment can be approved:(a) Implementation of the Plan of Action will not materially increase economichardship for current very low-income, low-income and moderate income tenantsor involuntarily displace current very low-income, low-income and moderateincome tenants (except for good cause) where comparable and affordablehousing is not readily available. The owner will agree to execute and allowthe recordation of use agreements to safeguard current tenants againstsuch adverse effects. The Plan of Action generally will not be consideredmaterially to increase economic hardship for current tenants if:(1) In the case of a project that is to be converted to cooperative orcondominium ownership, very low-income, low-income and moderate incometenants who are unable or unwilling to purchase cooperative shares or condominiumunits:andbullet; Are provided relocation assistance sufficient to secure adequate,comparable replacement housing at rentals not exceeding the levels setforth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or andbullet; Are allowed to remain as tenants, paying rents not exceeding suchlevels; and (2) In the case of a project which will continue as rental housing, theCommissioner determines that comparable and affordable replacement housingis available in the community and that tenants will be provided reasonablerelocation assistance.If the Commissioner determines that comparable and affordable replacementhousing is not available, a material increase in economic hardship willnot occur when rent contributions for current tenants do not exceed thefollowing percentages:andbullet; 30 percent of 50 percent of median areas income, adjusted by familysize, for tenants who are very low income tenants at the time of the increase,andbullet; 30 percent of 80 percent of median area income, adjusted by familysize, by tenants who are low income tenants at the time of the increase,and andbullet; 30 percent of 95 percent of median area income, adjusted by familysize, for tenants who are moderate income tenants at the time of the increase.The Commissioner may require that increases in rents for some or all ofthe such current tenants (except for increases made necessary by increasedoperating costs) allowed under this paragraph be phased in gradually; and(b)(1) The supply of vacant, comparable housing is sufficient to ensurethat the prepayment will not materially affect;(i) The availability of decent, safe and sanitary housing affordable tolow-income and very low-income families in the area that the housing couldreasonably be expected to serve;(ii) The ability of lower income and very low-income families to find decent,safe and sanitary housing near employment opportunities; or(iii) The housing opportunities of minorities in the community within whichthe housing is located; or(2) The Plan of Action has been approved by the appropriate State agencyand any appropriate local government agency for the jurisdiction in whichthe housing is located as being in accordance with a State strategy approvedby the Commissioner.It is incumbent upon the Owner to prepare the Plan of Action in such manneras to show and demonstrate that these findings are met.C. Plan of Action involving prepayment with Restrictions:Plans of Action not meeting the standards and findings under B., involvingtermination of low-income affordability restrictions, may be consideredfor prepayment with restrictions. Each such Plan will be evaluated on itsown merits and on a case-by-case basis, through negotiations between theOwner and HUD.An example of such a situation might be where, through restrictive, bindingagreements, such housing would be maintained as housing for the very low-income,low-income, and moderate income tenants for a designated time into thefuture, notwithstanding a prepayment of the current, existing mortgage.In this case, all low-income affordability restrictions would not be terminated,tenants (current and future) would be protected, and such a prepaymentwould not materially affect the supply of decent, safe and sanitary housingavailable to such tenants.Plans of Actions involving prepayment with restrictions shall clearly anddefinitively describe and demonstrate the manner and wherewithall to accommodatethe legislative mandates, i.e., conventional financing, State or localagency financial intervention, the Low-income Tax Credit Program, etc.Use Restrictions would be set forth in a document that would (1) be recordedin the appropriate land records, (2) have priority over all mortgage liens,and (3) be enforceable by HUD [and existing and, if applicable, potentialtenants].<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Incentives to Extend Low-Income Use:</ITAG>Where Plans of Action providing for prepayment of the mortgage cannot beapproved, or where an Owner might be induced to extend the low-income useof the project, (within certain market areas) HUD may agree to provideone or more Federal incentives, if such incentive(s) are determined tobe warranted in order to achieve the purposes of the legislation.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>such incentives will be offered only if (a) the propertyhas a higher and better use, as determined and shown in the Plan of Action,and (b) low-income affordability restrictions are locked-in for the remainingterm of the mortgage.</ITAG><T3>Incentives to Extend Low-Income Use, </T3>the specific incentives available,and individual procedures and step-by-step instructions for processing,are covered and detailed in Exhibit 6, published under separate cover.The incentives and the probable order in which HUD will consider such incentivesare briefly set forth here, as follows:(1) Increased access to residual receipts funds; For those projects ingood physical condition, HUD will consider releasing all or a portion ofthe projects residual receipts funds.Access to the Reserve for Replacement funds will not be entertained asa possible inducement given that the General Accounting Office, the Officeof Inspector General and HUD audits and reviews all have consistently foundthat the Reserve for Replacement funds do not have excessive balances tocover project needs. (2) Revisions to the method of calculating equity: HUD may consider revisingthe method of calculating equity based on the new appraised value as residentialrental housing, minus the total outstanding financial debt and encumbrances,to arrive at a new equity based on which the six percent rate of returnon equity is applied. (3) Provision of insurance for an equity loan, HUD may approve and insurean Equity Loan under section 241(f). The Owner would be required to seekout a mortgagee to submit an application for processing, and such processingand loan approval would be carried out in a pro forma manner.(4) Provision of Flexible Subsidy assistance; To provide financial assistanceunder the Flexible Subsidy Program in order to cure financial difficultiesand/or to fund deferred maintenance needs or the provision of capital improvementsfor the project.Though the legislative and regulation provisions covering prepayment includecapital improvement loans as a possible incentive, the Department doesnot plan to implement the Capital Improvements Loan Program at this time.However, the need for capital improvements can be met through the FlexibleSubsidy Program as stated above.(5) An increase in the allowable distributions, or other measures to increasethe rate of return; Increasing the allowable distribution by increasingthe current six percent rate to some higher agreed upon amount.(6) An increase in the rents permitted under an existing Section 8 Contract.Section 8, in and of itself, is not a real inducement not to prepay, buta funding mechanism to make it possible for the Owner to collect rentsfrom those tenants whose 30 percent of income would not meet the approvedrent. Therefore, on a case-by-case basis, subject to Appropriations Actfunding, the Department would consider providing some form of Section 8assistance for those particular tenants. <ITAG tagnum="81">E.
