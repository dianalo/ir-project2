But the phone keeps ringing.    Foreign reporters are calling, and they want to know when the Ministry of International Trade and Industry first learned that Toshiba Machine Co. was suspected of selling forbidden technology to the Soviet Union.    Mr. Iwai, director of MITI's strategic-export control office, stalls. He asks them to call back. He whispers with an assistant. Behind his flustered demeanor is the story of a bare-bones bureaucracy that appears to be in over its head in an area of grave international security.    Amid the furor over the Toshiba Machine case, little attention has been paid to the role of MITI inspectors and why they failed to detect the alleged falsification of the company's application for an export license.    The answer might be found in Mr. Iwai's corner of the 16th floor of MITI's shiny new headquarters in central Tokyo.    At first glance it's a typical office by Japanese bureaucratic standards, with calendars featuring nude women on the walls, ashtrays stuffed with cigarette butts and tall stacks of papers lining gray steel desks. Between the paper towers, men are hunched over, scribbling.    But the crush of paperwork seems more evident than is usual. To reach Mr. Iwai's desk, one steps around cardboard boxes filled with large envelopes of technical data. Binders of documents line the windowsills, each as thick as a book and representing one of the 4,000 to 5,000 applications filed each year in Japan for a license to export goods to Communist countries.    Here a staff of 10 people screen the applications for potential violations of rules set by the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, a 16-nation watchdog body created by the U.S. and its allies.    The officials arrive at about 9:30 a.m. and seldom leave before midnight, Mr. Iwai says. &quot;We're happy when we can get home on the last train,&quot; he says. On Saturdays, they can usually get out the door by 6 p.m.    The paperwork itself looks simple enough. The two-page forms, blotched with vermilion seals, have thick technical specifications stapled on.    &quot;That's the part where they say how many axes the machine has,&quot; Mr. Iwai says, pointing to the attachment. &quot;And they said two.&quot;    He's referring to the application Toshiba Machine, a unit of Toshiba Corp., made five years ago. The export of two-axis lathe machines to Communist countries doesn't violate Cocom rules, but Toshiba Machine allegedly concealed the fact that its machines could be adapted with the proper computer software to operate nine axes at once.    Such a sophisticated machine has strategic military applications, such as the manufacture of ultrathin propeller blades. U.S. officials claim that Toshiba Machine's exports gave the Soviets the ability to make submarines quieter and more difficult to track.    Japanese government officials say the alleged falsification probably couldn't have been detected even by a more rigorous detection process. &quot;The government has a relationship of trust with the industries,&quot; Mr. Iwai says. &quot;We rely on the confidence of these statements.&quot;    Repairing damage to that trust caused by the Toshiba Machine case is high on the agenda of Hajime Tamura, the Japanese trade minister. He summoned the leaders of four major industrial organizations to MITI headquarters yesterday and urged them to observe the laws and regulations strictly, officials say.    Mr. Tamura also outlined plans to close loopholes in the export licensing process, officials say. These include previously announced measures such as establishing a high-level committee to coordinate activities of various MITI divisions in processing export applications.    The trade minister also has announced plans to add five new inspectors to the strategic export control office.    The truth about Toshiba Machine's exports was uncovered in a protracted process, Mr. Iwai says.    In December 1985, a former employee of Wako Koeki Co. -- a Japanese company that allegedly served as an intermediary in the transaction between Toshiba Machine and the Soviet trading firm Techmashimport -- went directly to officials at Cocom's Paris headquarters with a tip that equipment had been exported illicitly, Mr. Iwai says.    Cocom notified Japanese officials, but they weren't able to uncover further information from Toshiba Machine, he says. Then, Japan received similar information in June 1986 from the U.S. Department of Defense, he says. Again, nothing came of attempts to learn more from Toshiba Machine.    Finally, detailed military information came from U.S. sources in December 1986 concerning deployment of the Japanese machines -- equipped with numerical controls supplied by a Norwegian company, Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk AS -- at a Baltic naval shipyard. The Japanese investigation then began in earnest, he says.    &quot;We asked and asked and they didn't tell the truth until the police entered the company&quot; last April, Mr. Iwai says. &quot;After that, all the facts were revealed.&quot;    Mr. Iwai, who was appointed head of the strategic export control office in mid-May after serving in a diplomatic post in the Netherlands, says he plans to reorganize the office and possibly review old Toshiba Machine applications for undetected irregularities.    Back files of other companies might be reviewed, he says, &quot;if my capacity allows it.&quot; MITI has prosecuted four other cases of Cocom violations by Japanese companies. </TEXT></DOC>
