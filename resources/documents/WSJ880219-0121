Phil Gramm, the Democrat turned wry Republican, likes to sum up recent American political history like this: For most of the past 50 years, a Democrat would periodically stand up and say the most powerful words in politics, &quot;I have an idea.&quot; A Republican would respond, &quot;I don't have an idea. But since I don't like your idea, here's what we'll do: You say you want to spend $50 billion on a new government program, but how about if we only spend $25 billion and get the private sector involved?&quot;    Naturally, says Mr. Gramm, the Democrats dominated America's political agenda -- at least until 1980, when Ronald Reagan changed the debate by campaigning on a competing idea of growth and opportunity free from the burdens of government.    A staple of 1988 campaign wisdom is that Mr. Reagan has permanently altered the nation's, and especially the Republican Party's, political conversation. The rebuttal to that argument may be the campaigns to date of the two Republican front-runners, Bob Dole and George Bush.    The striking fact about their political feud so far has been less its personal bitterness than its substantive vacuum. Far from fighting over some vision of the party's future, much less of America's, the pragmatists have been punching each other over who was President Reagan's most useful adjutant. If this feud is going to amount to anything more than entertainment -- Washington loves political mudwrestling -- is it too much to ask that they wrangle over something that matters?    The question obviously bears on who wins the nomination, but it may matter just as much for who wins in November. As both the majority party and the party of government spending, Democrats have a larger permanent constituency. Most of the Democratic candidates also have shed their party's Mondale-McGovern baggage, at least rhetorically, on issues such as taxes and defense; Republicans, in short, can't expect another ritual suicide. If a Republican wants to win the presidency, he'll have to run on something more than arms control and a more frugal welfare state. And it might help if he brought the subject up before Labor Day.    &quot;Republicans are just far too complacent about our prospects for winning the White House,&quot; argues Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber, one of the GOP's young insurgents first elected in 1980, and a Jack Kemp supporter. &quot;The difference is that in 1980 we had a visionary leader talking about policies people could get excited about. . . . This year we have the two front-runners engaging in the most useless, petty debates I can remember.&quot;    The second-tier Republican candidates at least seem to understand this. Mr. Kemp speaks of a &quot;progressive&quot; conservatism that would expand opportunity for blacks and the poor. Pete du Pont did better than an obscure former governor might have expected sounding libertarian themes. Even Pat Robertson, though he often says it in remarkable fashion, sounds a trumpet for moral renewal.    Mr. Bush, at least, may have learned the value of ideas himself in the past weeks. Before Iowa, his campaign message was little more than what Kemp aide John Buckley describes as, &quot;I was born to rule the empire.&quot; He liked arms control, he'd cut the capital gains tax and he wanted to be &quot;the education president&quot; -- not exactly the stuff of epic inspiration. &quot;There was just terrible resistance to saying anything of substance,&quot; explains one Bush aide. Senior aides such as pollster Robert Teeter and media consultant Roger Ailes were happy to have their man spar with Dan Rather, but they didn't want Mr. Bush to risk having a new idea.    The Iowa loss broke the reverie. The campaign brought in Peggy Noonan, a former Reagan speech writer who produced a sharper message attacking Congress and pointing out the differences between executive and congressional leadership. Mr. Ailes produced a 30-second TV spot saying Mr. Dole &quot;straddled&quot; on raising taxes, while Mr. Bush was opposed. With the New Hampshire win, however, Ms. Noonan returned to writing a book, and political technicians are back in charge.    For his part, Mr. Dole has also accented the personal over the issues. This, after all, is the campaign in which a senior aide once told The New Republic's Fred Barnes that his idea of spelling out a vision was to mention the word in speeches. In Iowa, Mr. Dole's big ideas were simply a shared cultural background and the bitter medicine of cutting the deficit, hardly something to man the barricades for. And for all his public displeasure with Mr. Bush's rough tactics, Sen. Dole can also throw a mean hook: He's the one who made a fuss about Mr. Bush's role in Iran-Contra, reinforcing congressional Democrats' attack on the Reagan executive.    &quot;We haven't had enough talk about issues,&quot; concedes Dole campaign chairman William Brock. &quot;And we will talk about issues. The vice president is uncomfortable with issues.&quot;    Mr. Brock says there's room to run to Mr. Bush's right on foreign policy and defense, especially arms control. Last week, he points out, Mr. Dole announced he wouldn't support any new arms-control agreement without &quot;linkage&quot; to other Soviet behavior. &quot;The vice president rejects linkage altogether,&quot; says Mr. Brock. He also cites drugs, education and child care as other places to expect Mr. Dole to stake out positions, &quot;all of them from a general conservative outlook.&quot;    All of which would partly console fretting Republicans, though a few still worry that the two may be terminal pragmatists who simply aren't capable of developing more compelling political messages. If that's true, Republicans may be in more political trouble than they think. </TEXT></DOC>
