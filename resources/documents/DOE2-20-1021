Theoretical analysis indicates that the holewill close due to the suction generated by the high speed water flowinto the hole. If this is the case other questions remain such as: doesthe closure involve pockets of entrapped water, at which depth belowthe surface the closure will be complete, how large is the water filledcavity directly behind the penetrator tail, to what extent the propertiesof the sediment along the penetrator trajectory will be changed due tothe penetration process. To solve these questions efforts have been undertakento install sensors on test penetrators or an extended part of the penetrators.For if hole closure is not complete one would expect a more rapid porepressure decay at the tail than a mid-height of the penetrator. However,in successive ESTG meetings it has been pointed out that the most effectiveway to obtain an answer to these questions would be to carry out a largediameter coring on the penetrator trajectory through the sediment. Early1986 the project got a definitive start with September 1986 being theproposed period of execution. When after the Chernobyl accident it appearedto be impossible to carry out the campaign in Italian waters, an alternativesite was sought in the French Mediterranean. After a site investigation,carried out in September 1986, showed a suitable site near Antibes, itbecame possible to perform HOCUS during November 7-26, 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
