No comments were receivedby the March 13 deadline. Therefore, this rule will supercede that proposedrule in order to update the fee schedule and fee waiver requirements ofthe Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(i), et seq., to complywith the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-570) andOMB Administrative Guidelines published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 17, 1987, Volume 52, No. 59, pages 10012-10020and in conjunction with the New Fee Waiver Policy Guidance issued by theU.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legal Policy issued on April 2, 1987.Executive Order No. 12600 concerning Predisclosure Notification Proceduresfor Confidential Commercial Information was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, Vol. 52, No. 122, pages 23781-23783 on June25, 1987. The Director has determined that this regulation is not a major rule withinthe meaning of E.O. 12291 because it will not have an effect on the economyof $100 million or more or otherwise meet the threshold criteria. Therefore,the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis is not required. The Director certifies that this regulation will not have a significanteconomic impact on any substantial number of small entities as definedby the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354. This regulation does not require use of a form, nor does it otherwise involvea collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44U.S.C. 3501-3520. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 503 </ITAG>Freedom of information.For the reasons set out in the preamble, 22 CFR Part 503 is amended toread as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 503_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1. The authority citation for Part 503 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>22 U.S.C. 2658; 31 U.S.C. 483a; 5 U.S.C. 301; 5 U.S.C.552 as amended by Pub.

Sections 503.7 and 503.8 are revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 503.7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Fees to be charged_categories of requests. </T3>The paragraphs belowstate, for each category of request, the type of fees that we will generallycharge. However, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited,waived, or reduced for the reasons given in paragraph (e) of this section.``Request'' means asking for records, whether or not you refer specificallyto the Freedom of Information Act. Requests from Federal agencies and courtorders for documents are not included within this definition. ``Review''means, when used in connection with processing records for a commercialuse request, examining the records to determine what portions, if any,may be withheld, and any other processing that is necessary to preparethe records for release. It includes only the examining and processingthat are done the first time we analyze whether a specific exemption appliesto a particular record or portion of a record. It does not include theprocess of researching or resolving general legal or policy issues regardingexemptions. ``Search'' means looking for records or portions of recordsresponsive to a request. It includes reading and interpreting a request,and also page-by-page and line-by-line examination to identify responsiveportions of a document.(1) <T3>Commercial use request. </T3>If your request is for a commercial use,USIA will charge you the costs of search, review and duplication. ``Commercialuse'' means that the request is from or on behalf of one who seeks informationfor a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interestsof the requester or of a person on whose behalf the request is made. Whethera request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the requestand the use to which the records will be put; the identity of the requester(individual, non-profit corporation, for-profit corporation), or the natureof the records, while in some cases indicative of that purpose or use,is not necessarily determinative. When a request is from a representativeof the news media, a purpose of use supporting the requester's news disseminationfunction is not a commercial use. (2) <T3>Educational and scientific institutions and news media. </T3>If youare an educational institution or a non-commercial scientific institution,operated primarily for scholarly or scientific research, or a representativeof the news media, and your request is not for a commercial use, USIA willcharge you only for the duplication of documents. Also, USIA will not chargeyou the copying costs for the first 100 pages of duplication. ``Educationalinstitution'' means a preschool, elementary or secondary school, institutionof undergraduate or graduate higher education, or institution of professionalor vocational education. ``Non-commercial scientific institution'' meansan institution that is not operated substantially for purposes of furtheringits own or someone else's business, trade, or profit interests, and thatis operated for purposes of conducting scientific research whose resultsare not intended to promote any particular product or industry. ``Representativeof the news media'' means a person actively gathering news for an entityorganized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. ``News''means information that is about current events or that would be of currentinterest to the public. News media entities include television and radiobroadcasters, publishers of periodicals (to the extent they publish ``news'')who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the generalpublic, and entities that may disseminate news through other media (e.g.,electronic dissemination of text). We will treat freelance journalistsas representatives of a news media entity if they can show a solid basisfor expecting publication through such an entity. A publication contractis such a basis, and the requester's past publication record may show sucha basis. (3) <T3>Other requesters. </T3>If your request is not the kind described byparagraph (a)(1) of this section or paragraph (a)(2) of this section, thenUSIA will charge you only for the search and the duplication. Also, wewill not charge you for the first two hours of search time or for the copyingcosts of the first 100 pages of duplication. (b) <T3>Fees to be charged_general provisions. </T3>(1) We may charge searchfees even if the records we find are exempt from disclosure, or even ifwe do not find any records at all. (2) We will not charge you any fee at all if the costs of routine collectionand processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of thefee. We have estimated that cost to be $5.00. (3) If we determine that you are (acting alone or with others) breakingdown a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid or reducethe fees charged, we may aggregate all these requests for purposes of calculatingthe fees charged. (4) We will charge interest on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st day followingthe day the bill was sent. The accrual of interest will be stayed uponreceipt of the fee, rather than upon its processing by USIA. Interest willbe at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of Title 32 U.S.C. (c) <T3>Fee Schedule_USIA will charge the following fees:</T3> (1) Manual searchingfor or reviewing of records: (i) When performed by employees at grade GS-1through GS-8 or FS-9 through FS-6_an hourly rate of $10.00 will be charged;(ii) When performed by employees at grade GS-9 through GS-13 or FS-5 throughFS-2_an hourly rate of $20.00 will be charged; (iii) When performed by employees at grade GS-14 or above or FS-2 or above_anhourly rate of $36.00 will be charged. (iv) When a search involves employees at more than one of these levels,we will charge the appropriate rate for each. (2) Computer searching and printing. The actual cost of operating the computerplus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given inparagraph (c)(1) of this section. (3) Photocopying standard size pages_$0.15 per page. (4) Photocopying odd-size documents (such as punchcards or blueprints)or reproducing other records (such as tapes)_the actual cost of operatingthe machine, plus the actual cost of the materials used, plus charges forthe time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1)of this section. (5) Certifying that records are true copies_this service is not requiredby the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, we will charge $10.00 per certification.(6) Sending records by express mail, certified mail, or other special methods.This service is not required by the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, wewill charge our actual cost. (7) Performing any other special service that you request and to whichwe agree_actual cost of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of anymaterials used, plus charges for the time of our employees, at the ratesgiven in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. (d) <T3>Procedures for assessing and collecting fees. </T3>(1) Agreement topay. We generally assume that when you request records you are willingto pay the fees we charge for services associated with your request. Youmay specify a limit on the amount you are willing to spend. We will notifyyou if it appears that the fees will exceed the limit and ask whether younevertheless want us to proceed with the search.(2) Advance payment. If you have failed to pay previous bills in a timelymanner, or if our initial review of your request indicates that we willcharge you fees exceeding $250.00, we will require you to pay your pastdue fees and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before we start searchingfor the records you want, or before we send them to you. In such cases,the administrative time limits as described in Section 503.6(b) above,will begin only after we come to an agreement with you over payment offees, or decide that fee waiver or reduction is appropriate.(e) <T3>Waiver or reduction of fees. </T3>We will waive or reduce the feeswe would otherwise charge if disclosure of the information meets both ofthe following tests (paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section): (1)It is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantlyto public understanding of government operations or activities, regardlessof any other public interest it may further. In making this determination,we may consider:(i) Whether the requester is in a position to contribute to public understanding;(ii) Whether the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessaryto understand the information; and,(iii) Whether the requester's intended use of the information would belikely to disseminate the information among the public, and(2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Commercialinterests include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Notonly profit-making corporations have commercial interests; so do nonprofitcorporations, individuals, unions, and other associations.(3) You must make your request for a waiver or reduction at the same timeyou make your request for records. Only the FOL Officer may make the decisionwhether to waive or reduce the fees. If we do not completely grant yourrequest for a waiver or reduction, the denial letter will designate theappeal official.<ITAG tagnum="66">andSection; 503.8_Exemptions.</ITAG>Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptionsto the mandatory disclosure of records. These exemptions and their applicationby the Agency are described below. In some cases, more than one exemptionmay apply to the same document. This section does not itself authorizethe giving of any pledge of confidentiality by any officer or employeeof the Agency.(a) <T3>Exemption one_National defense and foreign policy. </T3>We are notrequired to release records that are specifically authorized under criteriaestablished by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest ofnational defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classifiedpursuant to such Executive Order. Executive Order No. 12356 (1982) providesfor such classification. When the release of certain records may adverselyaffect U.S. relations with foreign countries, we usually consult with officialsof those area offices and/or with officials of the Department of State.We may also have in our possession records classified by another agency.If we do, we may consult with that agency or may refer your request tothat agency for their direct response to you, in which case we will notifyyou that we have made such a referral. (b) <T3>Exemption two_Internal personnel rules and practices. </T3>We are notrequired to release records that are related solely to the internal personnelrules and practices of an agency. We may withhold routine internal agencyprocedures such as guard schedules and luncheon periods. We may also withholdinternal records the release of which would help some persons circumventthe law or agency regulations.(c) <T3>Exemption three</T3>_<T3>Records exempted by other statutes. </T3>We are not required to releaserecords if another statute specifically allows us to withhold them. Anotherstatute may be used only if it absolutely prohibits disclosure or if itsets forth criteria identifying particular types of material to be withheld.(d) <T3>Exemption four</T3>_<T3>Trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information.</T3>We will withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial informationthat is obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.(1) <T3>Trade secrets. </T3>A trade secret is a secret, commercially valuableplan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing,compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said tobe the end product of either innovation or substantial effort. A directrelationship is necessary between the trade secret and the productive process.(2) <T3>Commercial or financial information, obtained from a person, and isprivileged or confidential. </T3>(i) Information is ``commercial or financial'' if it relates to businesses,commerce, trade, employment, profits, or finances (including personal finances).(ii) Information is obtained from someone outside the Federal Governmentor from someone within the Government who has a commercial or financialinterest in the information. ``Person'' includes an individual, partnership,corporation, association, state or foreign government, or other organization.Information is not ``obtained from a person'' if it is generated by USIAor another Federal agency.(iii) Information is ``privileged'' if it would ordinarily be protectedfrom disclosure in civil discovery by a recognized evidentiary privilege,such as the attorney-client privilege, or the work product privilege. Informationmay be privileged for this purpose under a privilege belonging to a personoutside the Government, unless the providing of the information to theGovernment rendered the information no longer protectible in civil discovery.  (iv) Information is ``confidential'' if it meets one of the following tests:(A) Disclosure may impair the Government's ability to obtain necessaryinformation in the future;  (B) Disclosure would substantially harm the competitive position of theperson who submitted the information;  (C) Disclosure would impair other Government interests, such as programeffectiveness and compliance; or  (D) Disclosure would impair other private interests, such as an interestin controlling availability of intrinsically valuable records, which aresold in the market by their owner.  (3) <T3>Designation of certain confidential information.</T3> A person whosubmits records to the Government may designate part or all of the informationin such records as exempt from disclosure under Exemption four. The personmay make this designation either at the time the records are submittedto the Government or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designationmust be in writing. The legend prescribed by a request for proposal orrequest for quotations pursuant to any agency regulation establishing asubstitute for the language is sufficient but not necessary for this purpose.Any such designation will expire ten years after the records were submittedto the Government.  (4) <T3>Predisclosure notification.</T3> The procedures in this paragraph applyto records that were submitted to the Government where we have substantialreason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be consideredexempt under Exemption four. Certain exceptions to these procedures arestated in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.  (i) When we receive a request for such records and we determine that wemay be required to disclose them, we will make reasonable efforts to notifythe submitter about these facts. The notice will inform the submitter aboutthe procedures and time limits for submission and consideration of objectionsto disclosure. If we must notify a large number of submitters, we may dothis by posting or publishing a notice in a place where the submittersare reasonably likely to become aware of it.  (ii) The submitter has five (5) working days from receipt of the noticeto object to disclosure of any part of the records and to state all basesfor its objections. (iii) We will give consideration to all bases that have been timely statedby the submitter. If we decide to disclose the records and the submitterstill does not agree, we will send a written notice to the submitter statingbriefly why we did not sustain its objections and will provide a copy ofthe records as we intend to release them. The notice will state that wewill disclose the records five (5) working days after the submitter receivesthe notice unless we are ordered by a United States District Court notto release them.  (iv) When a requester files suit under the FOIA to obtain records coveredby this paragraph, we will promptly notify the submitter.  (v) Whenever we send a notice to a submitter under paragraph (d)(4)(i)of this section, we will notify the requester that we are giving the submittera notice and an opportunity to object.  (5) <T3>Exceptions to predisclosure notification.</T3> The notice requirementsin paragraph (d)(4) of this section do not appy in the following situations:(i) We decide not to disclose the records;  (ii) The information has previously been published or made generally available; (iii) We have already notified the submitter of previous requests for thesame records and have come to an understanding with that submitter aboutthe records;  (iv) Disclosure is required by a statute other than the FOIA;  (v) Disclosure is required by a regulation, issued after notice and opportunityfor public comment, that specifies narrow categories of records that areto be disclosed under the FOIA, but in this case a submitter may stilldesignate records as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section andin exceptional cases, at our discretion, may follow the notice proceduresin paragraph (d)(4) of this section;  (vi) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this casewe will still give the submitter the written notice required by paragraph(d)(4)(iii) of this section (although this notice need not explain ourdecision or include a copy of the records).   (e) <T3>Exemption five</T3>_Internal memoranda. This exemption covers internalGovernment communications and notes that fall within a generally recognizedevidentiary privilege. Internal Govenment communications include an agency'scommunications with an outside consultant or other outside person, witha court, or with Congress, when those communications are for a purposesimilar to the purpose of privileged intra-agency communications. Someof the most common applicable privileges are:  (1) The deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects predecisionaldeliberative communications. A communication is protected under this privilegeif it was made before a final decision was reached on some question ofpolicy and if it expressed recommendations or opinions on that question.The purpose of this privilege is to prevent injury to the quality of theagency decisionmaking process by encouraging open and frank internal policydiscussions, by avoiding premature disclosure of policies not yet adopted,and by avoiding the public confusion that might result from disclosingreasons that were not in fact the ultimate grounds for an agency's decision.This privilege continues to protect predecisional documents even aftera decision is made. We will release purely factual material in a deliberativedocument unless that material is otherwise exempt. However, purely factualmaterial in a deliberative document is within this privilege if: (i) It is inextricably intertwined with the deliberative portions so thatit cannot reasonably be segregated, or (ii) It would reveal the nature of the deliberative portions, or (iii) Its disclosure would in some other way make possible an intrusioninto the decisionmaking process. (2) Attorney-client privilege. This privilege protects confidential communicationsbetween a lawyer and an employee or agent of the Government where an attorney-clientrelationship exists (e.g., where the lawyer is acting as attorney for theagency and the employee is communicating on behalf of the agency) and wherethe employee has communicated information to the attorney in confidencein order to obtain legal advice or assistance, and/or where the attorneyhas given advice to the client.  (3) Attorney work product privilege. This privilege protects documentsprepared by or for an agency, or by or for its representative (usuallyUSIA attorneys) in anticipation of litigation or for trial. It includesdocuments prepared for purposes of administrative adjudications as wellas court litigation. It includes documents prepared by program officesas well as by attorneys. It includes factual material in such documentsas well as material revealing opinions and tactics. The privilege continuesto protect the documents even after the litigation is closed.   (f) <T3>Exemption six_Clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. </T3>Wemay withhold personnel, medical, and similar files and personal informationabout individuals if disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarrantedinvasion of personal privacy.  (1) Balancing test. In deciding whether to release records that containpersonal or private information about someone else to a requester, we weighthe foreseeable harm of invading that individual's privacy against thepublic benefit that would result from the release of the information. Inour evaluation of requests for records, we attempt to guard against therelease of information that might involve a violation of personal privacyby a requester being able to ``piece together items'' or ``read betweenthe lines'' information that would normally be exempt from mandatory disclosure.(2) Information frequently withheld. We frequently withhold such informationas home addresses, ages, minority group status, social security numbers,individual's benefits, earning records, leave records, etc.   (g) <T3>Exemption seven_Law enforcement. </T3>We are not required to releaseinformation or records that the Government has compiled for law enforcementpurposes. The records may apply to actual or potential violations of eithercriminal or civil laws or regulations. We can withhold these records onlyto the extent that releasing them would cause harm in at least one of thefollowing situations: (1) Enforcement proceedings. We may withhold information when release couldreasonably be expected to interfere with prospective or ongoing law enforcementproceedings. Investigations of fraud and mismanagement, employee misconduct,and civil rights violations may fall into this category. In certain cases,we may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records that relate toviolations in order not to disclose that an investigation is in progressor may be conducted.  (2) Fair trial or impartial adjudication. We may withhold records whenrelease would deprive a person of a fair trial or an impartial adjudicationbecause of prejudicial publicity.  (3) Personal privacy. We are careful not to disclose information that couldreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personalprivacy. When a name surfaces in an investigation, that person is likelyto be vulnerable to innuendo, rumor, harassment, or retaliation.  (4) Confidential sources and information. We may withhold records whoserelease could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidentialsource of information. A confidential source may be an individual; a state,local, or foreign Government agency; or any private organization. The exemptionapplies whether the source provides information under an express promiseof confidentiality or under circumstances from which such an assurancecould be reasonably inferred. Also, where the record, or information init, has been compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority conductinga criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful nationalsecurity investigation, the exemption also protects all information suppliedby a confidential source. Also protected from mandatory disclosure is anyinformation which, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to jeopardizethe system of confidentiality that assures a flow of information from sourcesto investigatory agencies. (5) Techniques and procedures. We may withhold records reflecting specialtechniques or procedures of investigation or prosecution not otherwisegenerally known to the public. In some cases, it is not possible to describeeven in general terms those techniques without disclosing the very materialto be withheld. We may also withhold records whose release would discloseguidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if this disclosurecould reasonably be expected to create a risk that someone could circumventrequirements of law or of regulation.  (6) Life and physical safety. We may withhold records whose disclosurecould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety ofany individual. This protection extends to threats and harassment as wellas to physical violence. (h) <T3>Exemptions eight and nine_records on financial institutions and recordson wells. </T3>Exemption eight permits us to withhold records about regulationor supervision of financial institutions. (2) Exemption nine permits the withholding of geological and geophysicalinformation and data, including maps, concerning wells.   <ITAG tagnum="6">R.
