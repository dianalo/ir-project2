Kiesinger had been a member of the Nazi party from 1933 to 1945and worked in the foreign ministry's radio propaganda sectionduring World War II. He was never charged with war crimes oratrocities.   The Christian Democratic politician died in the TuebingenUniversity hospital of heart failure, his office in Bonn said in astatement released to the news media.   In 1966, Kiesinger succeeded fellow Christian DemocratChancellor Ludwig Erhard, whose mini-coalition with the small FreeDemocrats had broken up.   Kiesinger, serving as West Germany's third chancellor, was asymbol of reconciliation to many Germans. He grouped theconservative Christian Democrats and their Bavarian counterpartswith the leftist-leaning Social Democrats to forge what was calledthe ``Grand Coalition.''   It was the first German government in a generation to includethe Social Democrats, whose Willy Brandt served as the coalition'sforeign minister before taking over as chancellor in 1969.   Kiesinger, a Roman Catholic, was born April 6, 1904 in Ebingen,Baden-Wuerttemburg. Tall and silver-haired, he spoke with a vibrantvoice tinged with the dialect of his native Swabia.   As a 29-year-old lawyer, Kiesinger joined the Nazi party in1933, the year Adolf Hitler came to power. He said he becamedisillusioned with the party a year later because of the bloodypurge of storm trooper leader Ernst Roehm and his associates.   During World War II, Kiesinger worked in the radio propagandasection of the Nazi foreign ministry, acting as department head forsome of his term there.   After the war, he spent 16 months in an American internmentcamp. A German court fined him 50 marks, then $12.50, for being aparty member. The fine was remitted when the court ruled later thathe had risked his life to get a student out of a Nazi prison.   Kiesinger's Nazi past brought him much unfavorable publicitywhen he became a candidate for chancellor, and the issue cropped upagain during his term. He always denied any wrongdoing and declared:   ``I have clean hands. I know what I did and what I did not do.''   He forged stronger ties with the communist states of easternEurope, breaking with past policy. He opened diplomatic relationswith Romania and Yugoslavia, but his overtures suffered a setbackwhen the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968.   His government remained a resolute ally of the United States,but he feuded with President Johnson in 1967, when he complainedthat he had not been adequately consulted on a U.S.-Soviet nuclearweapons treaty.   He also let Johnson know that Bonn no longer could afford to buyenough U.S. arms to offset the cost of stationing U.S. troops inGermany. As a result, the United States withdrew 35,000 troops in1967.   His administration had inherited a recession, but the coalitionsuceeded in revitalizing the economy. Toward the end of hisKiesinger's tenure, however, the booming economy wrought highinflation that was a key to cracking the coalition he helped forge.</TEXT></DOC>
