It's common these days to regard retirement as a chance to starta second career, to keep working part time as a consultant, or tosee if a longtime hobby can be turned into a legitimate livelihood.   But the more money you can earn from such an endeavor, the morelikely you are to forfeit some or all of your annual SocialSecurity benefits.   Under the rules prevailing this year, retirees aged 62 to 64lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $2 they earn above$6,480 in any given year.   In the 65 to 69 age group, the cutoff point is $8,880. Nextyear, it's slated to rise to $9,360, beyond which $1 in benefitswill be negated for every $3 earned.   The restrictions don't apply to anyone aged 70 or older.   If you're drawing Social Security and working at a salaried job,there isn't much you can do about this situation _ other than lobbyfor, and hope for passage of, legislative proposals to make thelimits more generous.   But if you can set yourself up as an independent consultantworking for yourself and selling your services to others, you mayhave more flexibility, says William Brennan, editor of the monthlyFinancial Planning Reporter published by the accounting firm ofErnst andamp; Young.   In such circumstances, Brennan says, you might considerpostponing receipt of income from your work to future years inorder to minimize the bite of the Social Security limits.   With the notable exception of fees collected by people servingon boards of directors, ``self-employment earnings are only countedwhen received, not when `earned,''' he points out.   Thus, for example, a 64-year-old retiree doing free-lancecarpentry work this fall might choose to delay sending out somebills until yearend, so that payment doesn't count toward 1989earnings.   At age 69, the incentive to defer compensation would beespecially strong, since earnings are subject to no limit in thefollowing year.   To do this sort of thing, of course, you need to be able toestablish that you are truly self-employed, Brennan cautions.``Providing consulting exclusively to your former employer probablywon't work,'' he says.   Beyond having more than one customer, he observes, ``the realtest is the extent of your independence to make your own decisionsand set your own schedule.''   There also could be some pitfalls awaiting people who arelegally eligible to defer compensation, Brennan adds. The strategycould go awry if income tax rates are increased in future years.   If payment is put off for a significant time, inflation mayerode its value and it may not be available for you to invest itfor interest, dividends or capital gains.   There's also the question of how confident you are about thecustomer's ability and willingness to pay up when you eventuallywant to collect.   As popular as deferral strategies may be, Brennan concludes, itis prudent to make sure beforehand that their disadvantages won'toutweigh their benefits.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs.
