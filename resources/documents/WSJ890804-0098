Some question the effectiveness of this strategy. John Chipman of the University of Minnesota argued on this page in June that a country's trade balance depends on underlying macroeconomic conditions and that changes in exchange rates play no role. But the two are closely tied and jointly influence the trade balance.    For example, an increase in investment demand or in government spending can lead to larger trade deficits by raising current income and the demand for imports. If accompanied by a rise in interest rates, increases in demand will also be associated with currency appreciation and reduced competitiveness, producing an increase in the trade deficit beyond that associated with higher domestic income.    While the theoretical issues (including the desirability of minimizing trade imbalances) cannot be fully dealt with here, the experience of Taiwan and South Korea can help clarify the relationship between exchange rates and trade. Both Taiwan and Korea have had large trade surpluses and have sought to reduce them by letting their currencies appreciate against the dollar.    The charts trace the paths of competitiveness, as represented by the trade-weighted exchange rate, and the trade balances in Taiwan and Korea over the past 10 years up to the third quarter of 1988 (see accompanying chart-- WSJ Aug. 4, 1989). In the charts, real exchange-rate depreciation, or a gain in competitiveness, is represented by an upward movement in the shaded lines.    (The real exchange rate is a weighted average of the value of the New Taiwan dollar and the Korean won, respectively, against the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, and the German mark-with adjustments for the consumer price levels in these economies. The weights reflect the 1980 bileratal trade of Taiwan and Korea with industrial countries. The real trade balance illustrates changes in merchandise trade volumes in Taiwan and Korea, expressed in constant dollars. Both the exchange-rate and trade-balance series have been smoothed by taking three-quarter moving averages in order to emphasize the underlying trends.)    The charts show the trade-weighted exchange rates of Taiwan and Korea have steadily appreciated since late 1986, meaning a decline in competitiveness. This corresponds with a significant reduction in their trade surpluses. (Recent reports indicate the increase in Korea's trade surplus in the second half of 1988 was reversed in the first half of 1989.) Conversely, earlier exchange-rate depreciation was broadly associated with increases in the trade surplus in both economies. The relationship between exchange rates and trade in these two economies is confirmed by statistical analysis. (See my article in the spring 1989 San Francisco Fed Economic Review.)    However, changes in exchange rates and the trade balance do not always move together. For example, Taiwan's trade surplus increased sharply in the early 1980s, notwithstanding a marked currency appreciation. At the time, a slump in investment demand caused growth and the relative demand for imports to fall sharply, offsetting the tendency for the exchange-rate appreciation to reduce the trade balance. In contrast, after 1985, accelerating economic growth and a pickup in investment spending in Taiwan has reinforced the impact of exchange-rate appreciation, and contributed to a reduction in trade surpluses. Thus, other macroeconomic factors can significantly strengthen or weaken the observed relationship between changes in the exchange rate and the trade deficit.    Changes in exchange rates have also helped reduce the U.S. trade deficit in recent years. Between the third quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1989, the U.S. trade deficit declined 43% in volume terms, in the wake of a strong depreciation in the U.S. dollar. Because the dollar depreciation initially raised the cost of U.S. imports, declines in the volume of the trade deficit (which more accurately reflect the impact of exchange-rate changes on trade flows) were not reflected in declines in its dollar value until after 1987. &quot;Pace&quot; Prof. Chipman, they certainly have been evident since then.    Although exchange-rate changes matter, we have seen that other macroeconomic factors (such as investment, government spending and growth) also affect trade. As a result, efforts to reduce trade surpluses in Taiwan and Korea will be less effective if exchange-rate appreciation is not accompanied by macroeconomic policies that stimulate demand and increase imports in these two economies. By the same token, the appreciation of the currencies of Taiwan and Korea (and those of other countries) against the U.S. dollar will be less effective if the U.S. doesn't right its own fiscal ship.    In the absence of proper macroeconomic policies in the U.S., Taiwan's and Korea's trade surpluses will only be shifted to other economies, and U.S. trade deficits may persist. ---    Mr. Moreno is an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
