Though Britain criticized the joint initiative presentedby German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand, other member states welcomed it, sayingthey saw signs that a consensus is emerging on EC politicalunion talks. &quot;The French and Germans have moved (the debate)forwards, the British will take it a little backwards, andwe'll find a place somewhere in the middle,&quot; said aLuxembourg official.</LP><TEXT>   The Kohl-Mitterrand initiative doesn't attempt to settlemany of the most divisive issues in the political uniontalks, such as the precise powers of the European Parliamentor how foreign policy decisions will be made. Instead, itconcentrates on setting the broad goal of giving the EC adefense dimension for the first time.   The push to define the EC's goals comes in response to thebreathless pace of change in the Soviet Union and EasternEurope. Almost every country in Europe that isn't in the EC-- from neutral Sweden to former Warsaw Pact enemyCzechoslovakia -- has indicated a desire to join. The EC'sdrive to define its future is in part an attempt to servenotice to potential new members that the EC will no longer bejust a trade bloc, but a full-fledged member of the AtlanticAlliance.   &quot;We think it's important that the Europeans show clearlythrough concrete decision and institutional measures thatthey want to take greater responsibility in the fields ofsecurity and defense,&quot; Messrs. Mitterrand and Kohl said in anopening letter to Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers, who now headsthe EC's rotating presidency.   The plan is especially noteworthy because it reaffirms thepolitical commitment of the EC's driving force -- theFranco-German couple -- which is traditionally a key to anyEC decision. Political experts say the initiative shows thattwo leading politicians have bet their political future onthe success of the negotiations.   The proposal deals mainly with the long-term goal ofgiving the EC a role in European security, a task that upuntil now has been the exclusive purview of the U.S.-ledNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. In many ways, theinitiative is a more radical answer to a similar proposalmade 10 days ago by Italy and Britain. The Anglo-Italian plancalled for slow steps toward creating an independent Europeanpillar as part of the NATO alliance. The Franco-German plan,while not discounting the role of NATO, calls for giving theEC an immediate role to play.   &quot;Now we can confront both declarations and seekcompromises,&quot; said EC Commission President Jacques Delors.   The military implications of the Franco-German plan, whileappearing revolutionary, are still largely symbolic, analystssaid. In a footnote, the plan calls for the eventual creationof a &quot;European army corps&quot; that could bring differentnational army units under joint command of the nine-nationWestern European Union, the EC's defense forum.   But analysts said creation of a European army is a longway off. Germany, fearful of instability in Eastern Europe,remains committed to a strong U.S. presence in Europe throughNATO. France, on the other hand, has given no signs that itwill join NATO or abandon its independent nuclear force tosupranational control. &quot;Neither France nor Germany know whatthey mean by European defense,&quot; said Philippe MoreauDefarges, of the French Institute of International Relationsin Paris.   And even the French quietly admit that they wouldn't wantto see NATO abolished. German Defense Ministry sources saidexisting forces would be designated to the new joint force,rather than moved away from the NATO structure. &quot;This isprimarily a political declaration of intent-aimed atinvigorating the Maastricht summit,&quot; says a German defenseanalyst. &quot;There is no military planning called for in theaftermath of this declaration.&quot; (Maastricht, in theNetherlands, is the scheduled site of the next EC summit onpolitical unity, to be held in December.)   Besides giving a boost to the coming summit, theannouncement serves domestic political objectives both inGermany and in France. The government of Chancellor Kohl hasbattled for months over whether German forces can be sentoutside NATO's territory, which includes most of WesternEurope and Turkey. The Social Democrats oppose suchout-of-area activities and press for creation of a jointEuropean force capable of responding to political problems.Many German analysts and politicians say there is greatersupport for out-of-area activities as long as they occurunder the European flag.   A major success in Maastricht would also be a boost to Mr.Mitterrand, whose popularity has been falling and who facesfurther tough choices on cutting EC subsidies to farmers andaid to industry. He and Mr. Kohl have repeatedly held out thegoal of EC political union as one of their ultimate personalambitions, which if fulfilled, would guarantee them a placein history.</TEXT></DOC>
