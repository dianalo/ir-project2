The ruling is expected to give S corporation shareholders more flexibility in making arrangements to sell their shares, said one tax specialist, Robert Willens, a senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York.    In the September decision, Judge William M. Drennen, based in Washington, upheld the Internal Revenue Service in more than $35,000 of claims against Tirey L. Hume and his wife, Margaret, who had owned a one-third interest in an Oregon S corporation, Columbia Forge andamp; Machine Works Inc.    The Humes had argued that they didn't owe taxes on the S corporation for 1974 and 1975, because in 1971 certain Columbia shareholders had entered into an agreement to sell their shares to another company. The Humes argued that the agreement made Columbia no longer eligible for S corporation status, since S corporations can't have corporate shareholders. Therefore, the Humes reasoned, they no longer had to pay taxes on their share of Columbia's undistributed profits.    But the judge ruled that the S corporation status was valid until shares were actually sold, in 1975. So-called constructive-ownership rules, which treat optionees as shareholders, don't apply to S corporations, he said.    While negative for the Humes, who were also hit with a civil negligence penalty, the decision is useful for S corporation owners who wish to grant options on their shares, Mr. Willens indicated. </TEXT></DOC>
