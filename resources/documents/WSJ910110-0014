That, anyway, is Petrolane's official line. The bigpropane distributor, just 17 months after it was bought in a$1.2 billion leveraged deal by First Boston and QuantumChemical, says it isn't sure it will have sufficient moneythis year to make its debt payments. The company hasn't beenable to sell enough propane and is blaming totallyunforseeable events.</LP><TEXT>   But skeptics say Petrolane's current troubles prove onceagain that it's dangerous to pile debt upon even supposedlysteady businesses. Petrolane's story, they add, shows howpeople embraced debt in the 1980s without asking even basicquestions -- in Petrolane's case, what happens if the weatherchanges?   If Petrolane deteriorates further, its owners -- the WallStreet investment bank First Boston and the ethylene giantQuantum Chemical -- could lose their entire equityinvestments of about $90 million each. Petrolane's lossesalready have eroded the value of their stakes. Meanwhile,analysts say, Petrolane might soon have to ask its junkbondholders to forgive a lot of the $375 million in debt thatthey lent for the buy-out.   Petrolane buys and sells propane, mostly to Americans toheat their homes, so it needs harsh winters to prosper. Andit can't always pass along higher fuel costs to retailcustomers, so it is at the mercy of events that change energyprices.   In the past year, Petrolane paid a fortune to buy propane.And it was stricken by two warm winters in a row. Thecompany's cash flow has been running about 33% below itstargets.   Unless an arctic freeze takes hold soon, analysts say,Petrolane will barely have enough money to pay this year'sinterest bill of about $115 million, let alone make $50million of other debt payments due later this year. And withits finances deteriorating, some analysts say Petrolane'sbankers might balk at giving it all the working capital itneeds to keep going.   &quot;It's crazy to lever a company like that to death,&quot; saysNew York money manager and analyst Alan Gaines of GainesBerland. &quot;Now they're praying they'll be bailed out by coldweather and lower wholesale propane prices.&quot; Yet this winteris half over, he says, and Petrolane has debt falling duebefore next winter. Meanwhile, the Mideast crisis has pushedup all energy prices, including wholesale propane.   Recently, Mr. Gaines &quot;took a look&quot; at Petrolane's junkbonds. They were once popular and traded at more than 100cents on the dollar; now they are being offered in the low30s. Mr. Gaines passed on the bonds, saying: &quot;By the summer,they could trade at what? Maybe 15. Maybe 5.&quot;   Petrolane's Bill Owen, a financial vice president, saysthe company won't know until winter's end whether it mustrestructure its debt. Meanwhile, he thinks Petrolane'sbankers probably will waive some debt covenants to free upthe company's working capital lines of credit. &quot;What otherchoices do the banks have?&quot; he asks. &quot;When a businesss isinherently sound, all creditors come out better by workingout a solution.&quot;   There's too much &quot;Monday morning quarterbacking&quot; aboutPetrolane's buy-out, says Mr. Owen. The company would havepushed its debt maturities to later years if it had knownwhen it went private in 1989 that it was facing two of thewarmest winters in memory, he says, but who knew that? Duringhis 25 years in the propane business, &quot;it had a certainstability of cash flow,&quot; he says, making it &quot;an appropriatevehicle for a leveraged buy-out.&quot;   But Petrolane is a slave to the weather. Because of a warmfirst quarter in 1990, its retail business missed its saletargets by about 40 million gallons of propane, costing thecompany about $20 million in pretax profit, Mr. Owen says.   First Boston isn't saying much about Petrolane. It has hadother mishaps with buy-outs, losing a lot of money in recentyears on temporary &quot;bridge loans&quot; to Federated DepartmentStores and others. Petrolane's troubles spell bad news forQuantum Chemical, too; that company has a negative net worthand loads of debt, though its ethylene business isn't doingtoo badly and some analysts like its stock and junk bonds.   Quantum Chemical, a big propane player, says that despitethe buy-out's recent, &quot;unusual&quot; reverses, Petrolane is &quot;agreat franchise.&quot; Propane, a clean fuel, could have a brightfuture, a spokeswoman adds.   In 1989, when First Boston and Quantum Chemical teamed upto buy Petrolane, it seemed a smart move. They were buyingthe No. 2 distributor of propane to homes and industry, aboring but historically steady business that was supposed topay its debts easily and grow, enriching its new owners.   Instead, Petrolane's losses through September had eaten upall but $15 million of the $180 million in equity that thetwo partners originally plowed into the company. Neitherpartner will say if it will write down its Petrolaneinvestment. But both might have to do so if Petrolane doesn'tturn itself around, analysts say.   &quot;Only if Petrolane starts to generate strong cash flow canthe equity have value,&quot; says Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette'sCatherine Montgomery.   First Boston has earned big fees in the past by acting asQuantum Chemical's investment banker. Apparently, it hoped tomake at least 30% a year on its $90 million Petrolaneinvestment which, at the time, was a very large investmentfor a Wall Street firm to make in an industrial company.   The 1989 buy-out was not the first time that Petrolanechanged hands. A few years ago, Texas Eastern bought thecompany; then, in 1987, more than half of Petrolane was soldto the public as an energy partnership for $20.50 per unit.About two years later, First Boston and Quantum paid $30 aunit for all of Petrolane.   In the 1980s, many independent propane distributorschanged hands. Money manager Mr. Gaines says, &quot;They wereleveraged to the hilt and there was cutthroat competition,&quot;undermining what once was quite a good business.   Some people think Quantum Chemical, once a rumoredtakeover target, hoped that buying half of Petrolane wouldmake itself too big to be acquired. But with Petrolane,Quantum became the nation's leading propane player. And itplanned by merging its propane businesses to produce&quot;synergies,&quot; a Wall Street term denoting that, in a merger,two and two might add up to five. There have been &quot;economiesof scale,&quot; Quantum Chemical says, though analysts say thesavings weren't great.   Petrolane has made some strategic errors, asserts oneinvestment banker. A year ago, with propane prices soaringlong before the Mideast crisis, Petrolane loaded up onexpensive fuel, then couldn't sell enough of it when theweather thawed. And after it went private, it jacked upretail prices, losing some customers.   Petrolane's next step, says Donaldson Lufkin's Ms.Montgomery, might be to try to persuade bondholders to acceptmuch lower interest payments -- they're now getting 13 1/4% ayear -- and perhaps swap debt for equity in the company.Among other obligations, Petrolane has to pay $25 million ofbond interest Oct. 1. Ms. Montgomery doubts that thecompany's owners will funnel more money to Petrolane.   Says Mr. Gaines: &quot;The clock is ticking, and the debt iscoming due.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
