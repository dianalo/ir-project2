In a mid-December interview with this newspaper, Mr. Rabin predicted that violence in the territories would end within a week. The early tactics for dealing with Palestinian rioters, such as shootings, mass arrests and beatings, assumed that a policy of &quot;massive force&quot; would quickly quell disturbances.    Instead, Israeli troops have found themselves mired in continuing conflict. &quot;It has become a question of who will be tired first,&quot; the defense minister said in an interview at his Tel Aviv office Monday night. So far, he said, the Israeli population has been little affected, while Palestinians kept from work by the disturbances are under great economic stress.    In December, Mr. Rabin attributed the riots to efforts by Mideast radicals -- led by Syria, Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization -- to draw attention to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Although he said then that he didn't know all the reasons for the violence, he predicted the unrest in Gaza would quickly end. On Monday, however, Mr. Rabin said outsiders weren't in control of the demonstrations and acknowledged the protests probably will go on until a diplomatic solution settles the future of Gaza and the West Bank.    While demonstrators now are getting instructions from Palestinian radio stations in Syria and Iraq, Mr. Rabin said in the latest interview that outsiders aren't in control. &quot;It would be total hell here&quot; if the radio stations' directives were followed, he said. &quot;At best, about 5% of them are carried out.&quot;    The army will continue to use curfews and physical force against violent protests, Mr. Rabin said, carefully using the word &quot;hitting&quot; instead of &quot;beating&quot; to characterize the policy that has brought him widespread international criticism.    But soldiers have been told that they needn't force open the shops of Arabs taking part in commercial strikes. &quot;I want to reduce the areas of friction to what is really vital,&quot; he said.    So far, Palestinians haven't escalated the conflict by using firearms.    &quot;I don't believe that in the hundreds of demonstrations in the last two months no one was in possession of a pistol, a Kalashnikov {a Russian-made rifle} or a hand grenade,&quot; he said. That they haven't been used reflects the &quot;collective wisdom&quot; of the Palestinians, who recognize that trading rocks for guns would forfeit international sympathy, Mr. Rabin said.    U.S. Special Envoy Richard Murphy arrived in Israel yesterday to continue discussion of a new U.S. peace initiative, which Mr. Rabin said he &quot;welcomes.&quot;    Mr. Rabin, a member of Israel's Labor Party, has long held the position that the way to settle the occupied territories' future is through a general Israel-Arab peace negotiation in which Israel's main negotiating partner would be Jordan. &quot;I was for a political process before&quot; the unrest broke out, &quot;and I'm for it now,&quot; he said. &quot;I view the two things separately.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
