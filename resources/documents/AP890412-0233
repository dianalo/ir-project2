While original screenplays remain the most prevalent source offilms, it is heartening to see the comeback of novels.   Why so? Because from ``The Birth of a Nation'' to ``Gone Withthe Wind'' to ``Terms of Endearment,'' novels have lent filmentertainment a substance that is often lacking on a diet ofscripts originated by screenwriters and homogenized by countlessrewrites.   ``Winter People'' is the latest evidence. Adapted by CarolSobieski from John Ehle's novel, the film has faults and excesses.But it also offers a certain majesty and an accurate sense of timeand place _ the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Depression 1930s.   Wayland Jackson (Kurt Russell) is a watchmaker who is drivinghis motherless daughter (Amelia Burnette) to Philadelphia to starta new life. When their pickup truck is wrecked in a mountainstream, they take refuge with a mysterious woman (Kelly McGillis),who lives in a remote cabin with her fatherless baby boy.   The mystery unravels. McGillis has been ostracized by herfamily, the Wrights, who are the leading citizens of a nearbyvillage. The father of her child is the unruly son (Jeffrey Meek)of the lawless Campbell clan, longtime enemies of the Wrights.   Russell wins the young mother's confidence and love, and therespect of her family _ after proving his manhood on a bear hunt.When the father of McGillis' son dies mysteriously, thelong-smoldering feud between the Wrights and the Campbells eruptsin violence.   Director Ted Kotcheff manages to keep the complicated plotrunning smoothly, though at times the mountain dialect is hard tocomprehend. Kelly McGillis gives understated strength to her role,and Kurt Russell has his strongest characterization to date, thoughthe transition from milquetoast to macho man is less than smooth.   Lloyd Nolan and Mitchell Ryan are powerful as patriarchs of thetwo families. As the violent Campbell, Jeffrey Meek is terrifying.The mountain scenery have been stunningly photographed by FrancoisProtat.   ``Winter People'' was produced by Robert H. Solo for ColumbiaPictures. Scariness and sexual tension give it a PG-13 rating.Running time: 115 minutes.</TEXT><TEXT>   Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions:   G _ General audiences. All ages admitted.
