The Japanese electronics concern plans to spend $300million retooling an idled Volkswagen AG plant to produce onemillion television tubes annually for its large-screenTrinitron sets sold in the U.S. and in export markets. Theplant will have 1,000 employees within three years afterproduction begins in 1992.</LP><TEXT>   Sony said part of the additional investment will betargeted for its television manufacturing plant in San Diego.That plant will use more computerized manufacturing, movingmore of the labor-intensive work to facilities in Mexico,Sony officials said.   Though Sony also was expected to announce plans toassemble television sets in New Stanton, company officialssaid yesterday that a decision hasn't been made on thatissue. They said the company is still considering severallocations, including the former Volkswagen plant. Sonyofficials met this week with Kentucky officials to assurethem that that state was still being considered for thetelevision assembly plant.   Eventually, the site chosen for television assembly couldbe home to Sony's first U.S. production of high-definitiontelevision sets. Neil Vander Dussen, president of Sony Corp.of America, said Sony is awaiting federal governmentguidelines on the new technology, expected to be released in1991, before deciding where to locate U.S. production.   In winning over Sony for its television picture-tubeplant, Pennsylvania competed with several other states,including Kentucky and Ohio. The Pennsylvania incentivepackage promises about $23.5 million in low-interest loansfor renovations and job training grants, among other things.Kentucky apparently offered a hefty package valued at between$30 million and $40 million, including free land and fundsfor infrastructure improvements and training workers.   But Sony officials said they favored the New Stanton siteover others because of its proximity to interstate highwaysand the availability of skilled workers.   Moreover, Pennsylvania agreed to waive a $40 millionmortgage owed by Volkswagen in exchange for ownership of theWest German auto maker's plant and 1,200-acre site. Sony willpay about $21 million in lease payments for about 800 acresof the property.</TEXT></DOC>
