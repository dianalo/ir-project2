(products).andO;Ticker:    WDST.andO;Product:   WordStar 6.0 (Word processing software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationWord Processing Software.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Wordstar gives its loyal fans a new lookandM;Do you remember those good-old, bad-old days of CP/M?andP;  Do you rememberWordStar - the legendary word processor that gave microcomputers abusiness-tool respectability then was swept away by the MS-DOS generation ofslick, user-friendly word processors?andM;Supported mostly by loyal fans, WordStar survived the menu-driven,user-friendly era of word processing, and with the release of version 6.0, isclimbing back into contention.andM;This version retains and improves the powerful features that made theoriginal WordStar such a hit, and includes the desktop publishing (DTP)features demanded in a modern word processor.andM;WordStar 6.0 has a modern, Alt-Key, pull-down-menu interface.andM;The original control-key interface was loved by touch-typing professionalusers, but terrified beginners.andM;I never did understand why control-key sequences were harder to learn thanthe function-key sequences of other word processors, but WordStar was tarredas &quot;that control-key word processor&quot;.andM;Power users can still switch to the original control-key interface, orinstall it to come up as the default system.andM;Many of us do not need a complicated, full-blooded, disk-hogging,memory-grabbing, DTP program to typeset a few memos or a monthly newsletter.andO;We would be happy if our favorite word processor included some simple DTPfeatures.andM;Most word processor makers -- including WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, andWordStar recognized this and responded with &quot;version five&quot; word processorsthat included DTP features.andP;  WordStar 6.0 takes the evolution a stagefurther.andP;  This version includes some more sophisticated typesetting options.andM;For instance, &quot;kerning&quot; - the way typeset letters ten to wrap around eachother to even out the white space.andP;  (Look at the italic letters &quot;nf&quot; - noticehow the descender of the &quot;f&quot; wraps under the little curly tail (serif) of the&quot;n&quot; - that's kerning.)andM;Scalable fontsandM;WordStar 6.0 also supports fully scalable fonts.andP;  This means that the size ofcharacters can be changed in tiny increments.andM;Scalable fonts have long been a feature of PostScript laser printers.andO;Although most of the version 5.0 word processors include a PostScript driver,they only print characters in certain, pre-defined, character sizes.andM;WordStar 6.0 allows you to set a character size from tiny, right up to a sizethat fills the whole page with a single character.andP;  It will do this forPostScript printers, or the new scalable-font, Hewlett Packard Laserjet III.andM;Actually, when combined with the LaserJet III, WordStar 6.0 really shines.andO;HP and WordStar collaborated in the development of these two products andlaunched them simultaneously.andM;WordStar knows about all the bells and whistles of this new generationprinter.andM;Support for most other modern printers is also good.andP;  The complex process ofinstalling printer, bit-mapped fonts, scalable fonts, cartridge fonts, pagelayouts, and special features is simplified by a, menu driven installationprogram.andM;Other features include: better implementation of &quot;style tags&quot; that allowsweeping format changes to sections of a document, improved conversion ofdocument files to and from DisplayWrite, DCA/RFT, Microsoft Word, MultiMateAdvantage, and WordPerfect; and improved training and technicaldocumentation.andM;WordStar 6.0 comes with a bunch of support products.andP;  This is a mixed bag.andO;Most users will find the communications package and the file finder to be oflittle use, preferring more powerful, dedicated packages to do these jobs.andM;The outline utility is fairly useful, but is so badly integrated withWordStar that it becomes annoying - you must &quot;convert&quot; files back and forth.andM;On the other hand, the address-file mail-merge is useful, and thespell-checking thesaurus/dictionary is about the best you can get, and iscompletely integrated into the word processor.andP;  Single keystroke commandsspell-check and define a word.andM;WordStar 6.0 lists for $600.andM;Cairn MacGregor, a columnist with the Montreal Gazette, specializes in hightechnology writing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
