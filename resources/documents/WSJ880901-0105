Epitope Inc. has a plan to keep that apple from going bad in the first place.    The small Beaverton, Ore., biotechnology concern said it entered a year-long research agreement with Sakata Seed Corp. of Japan to determine whether it can control the ripening of vegetables, fruits and flowers using genetic engineering techniques. The ability to do so would obviously have benefits to growers and consumers alike, by reducing post-harvest spoilage and perhaps even widening the window of availability of certain seasonal agricultural products.    &quot;Anytime you can control ripening and bring products to the marketplace when you want, you've hit it big,&quot; says Richard A. Bock, senior vice president of Sutro andamp; Co.'s bioscience group in Los Angeles. &quot;You're talking about the potential ability to bring strawberries to market in January, or tomatoes to the market two weeks before they become seasonal.&quot;    Epitope is pinning its hopes on a gene, isolated by the company's director of research, A.J. Fero, that appears to control a hormone that produces ethylene, a gas that plays a predominant role in the ripening process. Banana growers, for example, have long applied ethylene manually to bananas to hasten their ripening.    But the Epitope research aims at using gene-transfer and tissue-culture techniques to create new vegetable hybrids with genetic codes that essentially would have them ripen on a grower's timetable, says Mr. Fero. Under its agreement with Sakata, Epitope will focus on the Japanese company's major products, broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower -- Sakata, for example, controls 80% of the world's broccoli seed market.    &quot;The early indications are that the technique works, but we are still in the experimental stages,&quot; cautioned Jerry Florence, an Epitope spokesman. He declined to discuss financial terms of Epitope's agreement with Sakata, although the one-year research contract could be extended another two to three years, depending on results.    Analysts say the Epitope-Sakata research, a decade ago the stuff of science fantasy, could be a major boon to the already burgeoning multibillion dollar agriculture-biotech market should it prove successful. Currently, only a handful of other companies, including Calgene Inc., are involved in tangential research and the payoffs could be enormous. Calgene, for example, is working on a genetic engineering technique that essentially keeps ripe tomatoes from turning quickly mushy by blocking the enzyme that causes softening. </TEXT></DOC>
