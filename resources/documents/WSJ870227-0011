The minimum tax has been around since 1978. Beginning this tax year, however, there will be an increase in the number of so-called preference items -- mostly items counted as deductions for purposes of the regular income tax -- that can trigger the alternative minimum tax, now set at 21%.    As a result, many individuals may for the first time have to pay taxes on 1987 income using the complex minimum-tax calculation.    Income earned in 1986 generally is safe from the minimum tax as long as the preference items don't equal more than 100% of a person's regular taxable income. In the 1987 tax year, however, preference items amounting to 83.3% of such income will trigger the minimum tax. And by 1988, when the maximum tax rate for most people is scheduled to decline to 28%, the amount of preference items needed to trigger the tax drops to 33% of taxable income.    If you think you might be liable for the minimum tax in 1987, figure your tax bill in both the usual way and the manner called for by the new minimum-tax rules. You'll generally have to pay whichever is higher.    The new tax law gives taxpayers on the minimum-tax borderline one break by wiping out the favorable tax treatment on long-term capital gains. The 60% of such gains that previously was shielded from regular tax was a preference item for the minimum tax. That preference is gone as of this year; but minimum-taxpayers won't get the benefit of certain other deductions.    The new rules will make it more expensive, for example, for many people to give appreciated property, such as stock, to charity. Donating stock instead of cash will still enable regular taxpayers to avoid tax on the capital gain while getting a deduction for the stock's current market value. But the stock's appreciation is now a preference item for the minimum tax. &quot;It can hit you when you're not expecting it,&quot; Leon Nad, a tax partner at Price Waterhouse, says.    Another example: The regular tax will permit limited deductions until 1990 for consumer interest and will let investors use at least some passive losses -- from rentals or from business activities where they aren't regularly involved in management -- to offset such income as salaries. Under the minimum tax, however, consumer-interest and passive-loss deductions become preference items.    Individuals who might be subject to the minimum tax will also have to be careful with home-equity loans. Regular tax allows homeowners to take out such loans for as much as the purchase price of the house plus improvements and to deduct the interest. Interest on even larger loans is deductible if the loan is used for medical or educational expenses.    By contrast, minimum-tax filers must use proceeds from a home-equity loan to &quot;substantially rehabilitate&quot; their property. And if they borrow more than the amount of their existing mortgage, the interest isn't deductible at all.    One bit of cheer is the new minimum-tax credit. Starting this year, all but four preference items will generate the credit. People paying the minimum tax this year can use the credit in future years when they pay regular income taxes.    ---   Ms. Bettner, based in Los Angeles, writes frequently on personal finance for The Wall Street Journal.    ---   Estimating the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for 1987    This work sheet will help you determine whether you couldbe liable for the minimum tax this year; you should seek anaccountant's help in figuring your actual minimum taxliability.
