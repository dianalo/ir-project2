The government will accelerate the elimination of importquotas, to stimulate competition in the Spanish market.Spanish companies no longer will need governmentauthorization for short-term foreign-currency loans foramounts exceeding 1.5 billion pesetas ($14.2 million).Spaniards also will be allowed to open bank accounts abroad.The moves are aimed at cutting the red tape that drives upthe cost of operating in Spain's financial markets.   To boost competitiveness, Spain plans to revamp laborlaws, streamline hiring procedures and introduce professionaltraining programs.   The Bank of Spain will be granted greater autonomy,particularly in monetary policy, which now is largely theresponsibility of the Economy Ministry.                                                                                                          DEVELOPMENT FUND FAVORS ASIA                                                                                                          A World Bank affiliate said it is investing a record $2.9billion in private companies in 46 developing countries thisyear, up from $2.2 billion last year. And for the first time,Asia will get more of the cash than any other region. Asiareplaced Latin America as the leader for InternationalFinance Corp. loans, as nations such as Thailand are growingfaster than traditional growth economies such as Brazil andArgentina. The IFC this year is investing in 152 projects.                                                                                                          CREDIT-CARD VENTURE IN VIETNAM                                                                                                          A Japanese consumer credit company, JCB Ltd., will launcha credit card operation in Vietnam next month jointly with aHanoi foreign-exchange bank. The move to have JCB cardshonored is in response to Japanese tourism's rapid growth inVietnam since it opened its economy to foreigners. About10,000 Japanese are expected to visit Vietnam this year, upfrom 4,000 last year. For now, JCB won't issue its cards inVietnam.                                                                                                          ITALY WARNED ON ECONOMY                                                                                                          The Italian economy's development faces serious risksbecause of rapid inflation, high unemployment, huge budgetdeficits, steep labor costs and widespread inefficiencies,the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentsaid. The 24-member group of wealthy nations warned Rome itmust tackle these problems if its economy is to benefit fromEurope's late-1992 market integration.                                                                                                          SINGAPORE PLANS CHEMICAL ISLAND                                                                                                          Singapore is planning a &quot;chemical island complex&quot; on sevensouthern islands to be linked by causeways and landreclamation. The complex could be as large as 7,410 acres andtake 10 to 15 years to complete. A Parliament member said ata chemical industry conference that the Asia-Pacific regionis expected to account for more than 40% of world-wide demandfor petrochemical products in this decade.                                                                                                          SEOUL'S ECONOMY ON RED ALERT                                                                                                          South Korea announced special measures to slow andstabilize the economy, marred by rising prices and a growingcurrent-account deficit. While tightening the money supply,Seoul will move to expand savings and boost exports, andbegin to deregulate interest rates this year instead of nextyear. Seoul also sought to dispel perceptions its effort tocut consumption is an anti-import move.                                                                                                          EUROPEAN TAX PLAN TAKES HEAT                                                                                                          European industry will battle efforts to tax the burningof fossil fuels in the European Community. The EC Commissionis reviving a plan to fight global warming by raising thecost to users of oil, natural gas and coal.   Though EC officials said the plan's overall effect was&quot;fiscally neutral,&quot; many industrialists foresee an added taxburden on business. An oil official said the industry wouldtake voluntary actions to achieve greater energy efficiency.   Unice, the European employers' federation, and oil,chemical, auto, metals and cement industry groups plan tolobby against the proposals, which they said would hurt theEC's competitiveness.   The plan stems from an EC decision last year to stabilizeby the year 2000 carbon-dioxide emissions, blamed for thegreenhouse effect, the atmosphere's slow warming withpotentially disastrous climatic consequences. The commissiondecided the best way to reduce the emissions was to boostenergy costs, thus prompting industry, households andmotorists to burn less fuel. The goal would be to raise oilprices about $10 a barrel to $30 by the end of the decade.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          The European Community is expected soon to seal anantitrust agreement with the U.S. on information swaps anddispute resolution, such as for corporate mergers. Talks alsoare scheduled on cooperation between securities watchdogs andon U.S. banking reform proposals, which European banks fearcould force them to increase reserves or reduce operations. .. . Japanese land prices show signs of stabilizing. ANational Land Agency survey found prices on average rose 2.7%from a year earlier for residential land and 3.4% forcommercial sites. Last year, both categories surged 13%.</TEXT></DOC>
