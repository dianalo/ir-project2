(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Judicial College, about tocelebrate 25 years of teaching America's judges how to judge, hascourses that cover everything from the ethical dilemmas of medicineto the proper way to wear that black robe.   And most of the 22,000 graduates, about one-third of all U.S.judges, have completed the one to four weeks of classes withoutincident.   But William B. Lawless, a former Notre Dame Law School dean whonow heads the college, can recollect at least one class that was abit too realistic. It landed five students _ all judges _ behindbars.   ``Oh, it was wonderful; those were experimental times,'' Lawlesssaid. ``We were trying everything to teach people the judicialprocess.''   The jurists went to a bar and, as part of the scheme, werepropositioned by two young women. A man pretending to be angryintervened and hit one of the startled judges in the stomach twice.   All were arrested and jailed, and it was several hours beforethey figured out it was an act to introduce them to the other sideof the bench.   ``A couple of them threatened to sue us for falseimprisonment,'' said Lawless, with a laugh. ``They dropped it,though. Yes, we have a checkered past.''   This weekend the school celebrates its 25th anniversary inceremonies presided over by Judge Joseph Wapner of television's``People's Court.''   The college was founed in 1963 by U.S. Supreme Court Justice TomClark, who saw a void in judicial training. As one former deanliked to say, ``Law schools train lawyers. They don't trainjudges.''   The college on the University of Nevada-Reno campus hasvolunteer rotating instructors from across the U.S. and is fundedby an endowment of more than $6.8 million in state funds, privatedonations and American Bar Association money.   Although the 1,600 who attend the college each year don't facejail any more, new judges usually begin with an intense four-weekgeneral course affectionately known as ``boot camp.''   The course explains just about everything from how to put onyour robe and how to conduct yourself in court to actual courtproceedings.   Other issues covered at the college are ways of keeping courtcases flowing; alcohol, drugs and the courts; how to handleevidence; how to write an opinion; sentencing guidelines; medicalevidence; search and seizure; jury instructions, and traffic court.   The college has ongoing courses to update judges on currentissues, like AIDS, surrogacy, bioethics, and conducts seminarsacross the country.   Graduates, who include U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra DayO'Connor, receive a certificate.   ``We're still growing,'' said Lawless, who has been dean sincelast September. One of the school's goals is to build a mockcourtroom.   The judges are encouraged to bring their families and often goto shows and casinos in their spare time. They also take advantageof the hiking, skiing and boating available in the area.   ``It was tough but extremely valuable to a new judge because ittouched on most of the issues judges have to deal with,'' saidAlabama Circuit Court Judge Joseph Colquitt of Tuscaloosa.   Colquitt said the training helped when he decided against ahospital that was trying to get court permission to amputate awoman's gangrenous leg, arguing that she would die without theoperation.   ``The last time I heard she was still walking around,'' thejudge said. ``What I did in that case was rely on what I hadlearned about prevailing law in similar cases.   ``In most jurisdictions you don't come up against the unusualcase. But every once in a while you do. Judges must be prepared andI think the National Judicial College does that.''</TEXT></DOC>
