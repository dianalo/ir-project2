Management and directors of the Minneapolis food and restaurant concern have been searching for a response for nearly a month, employing no less than four Wall Street investment banking firms at a cost of millions of dollars. Pillsbury's board meets again today, and while the company won't say whether a response will be forthcoming, events and outside pressures are almost certain to force one.    Perhaps most significant was this week's ruling by a Delaware Chancery Court that may restrict certain kinds of corporate poison pill defenses. On Tuesday, the court struck down Interco Inc.'s poison-pill defense against a $2.73 billion offer from the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C. The decision is under appeal.    Pillsbury has a similar poison pill defense, and tomorrow will have to defend it in the same court.    Although the outcome of Interco's appeal isn't clear, legal experts think the ruling can only hurt Pillsbury, since the court in that case decided that Interco was using its pill to delay a valid tender offer. &quot;If Pillsbury doesn't have a proposal by the time of the hearing, I think it will weaken their position,&quot; said Robert A. Helman, a partner with the Chicago law firm Mayer, Brown andamp; Platt.    Pillsbury shareholders both large and small have been chafing at the company's prolonged silence on an alternative. Some are tired of hearing nothing. One large institutional holder, David J. Greene andamp; Co., sent an angry telegram to Pillsbury, saying, &quot;We strongly object to management's refusal to meet with representatives of Grand Met.&quot;    Late yesterday, Grand Met issued a statement reaffirming that the companies aren't negotiating. &quot;All requests by Grand Metropolitan to open discussions with Pillsbury have been unanswered,&quot; it said.    Also yesterday, a Minnesota state judge granted class-action status to a shareholders' lawsuit seeking to force Pillsbury to accept Grand Met's offer.    The Interco decision caused Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. to change its recommendation on Pillsbury from a &quot;buy-hold&quot; to a &quot;sell&quot; yesterday. Noting that the stock had gone above $60, analyst Lawrence Adelman said the ruling &quot;seems to tie the hands of the management group and not necessitate a higher offer on the part of Grand Met.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Pillsbury shares closed at $61.50, up 25 cents.    Other analysts and some institutional portfolio managers think Pillsbury's options also are limited, given the company's recent operational problems. Many doubt the company could come up with a more attractive alternative than Grand Met's $60-a-share, all-cash bid.    Stephen M. Carnes, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis, believes any restructuring announced by Pillsbury would require the sale of all its restaurants, including its Burger King Corp. chain. &quot;If you're going to pay a $25 to $30 cash dividend you need to sell big assets,&quot; Mr. Carnes said. &quot;The company's sick and you're getting a 'well' price.&quot;    &quot;The company is a dead duck, and the only thing they can do is diminish the ultimate value to the shareholder, and that would be unfortunate,&quot; said Gerald R. Jordan Jr., president of Hellman, Jordan Management Co., which has &quot;substantially lightened up&quot; on what once was a 392,400-share holding.    Like many others, Mr. Jordan drew parallels between the recapitalization Kraft Inc. used to respond to Philip Morris Cos.' initial $90-a-share tender offer. That countermove included an $84 cash dividend to shareholders, another $14 in junk bonds and continued ownership of Kraft stock.    &quot;Today, the cost of junk bond financing has become prohibitive for anyone doing an LBO or offering securities to others,&quot; Mr. Jordan said. He is particularly unhappy at Pillsbury's consideration of a Pac Man defense in which it would buy shares of Grand Met to fend off the British distiller, gambling and franchise concern.    &quot;That's not in the shareholders' interest,&quot; he said. &quot;The fat is in the fire.&quot;    Alan Greene, managing partner of David J. Greene, said Grand Met's price &quot;is reasonable to generous. My hunch is they could negotiate four or five more points if they were willing to do a friendly transaction.&quot;    A Pillsbury spokesman declined to comment yesterday on the impact of the Interco case, or confirm that the board is meeting today. But another company executive said &quot;all the shots are being called by the lawyers and the bankers in New York . . . We're handholding with people in the dark.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
