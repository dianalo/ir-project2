Under plans outlined in the report, the New York FederalReserve Bank will pull back from surveillance of dealers,removing what some in the industry have perceived as acreditworthiness stamp of approval. At the same time, othersteps recommended in the report will make it easier for morefirms to become dealers, adding to market players' concernthat the financial strength of players on the other side oftrades will be lessened.</LP><TEXT>   These changes could force dealers to limit their tradingpartners, market players contend, and possibly accelerate thecollapse of firms that are already in trouble.   The report contains dozens of recommendations andconclusions offered by the Federal Reserve, the TreasuryDepartment and the Securities and Exchange Commission aftertheir four-month study of the world's largest debt market.   The review followed admissions last summer by SalomonBrothers Inc., the largest primary dealer, that it repeatedlyfalsified bids in Treasury auctions. The Salomonannouncements sent shockwaves through a marketplace that hadbeen a cozy old boys' network overseen by regulators willingto let the market handle its own problems.   As reported, the study, coupled with other steps takenlast year by the Treasury, proposes to overhaul the auctionsystem to lessen the possibility of collusion among dealers,tighten enforcement of the auction process, eliminate severeshort squeezes by selling more debt when needed, and torevamp the requirements to become a primary dealer.   The study also shows that the government is concernedabout the role in the government-securities market of &quot;hedgefunds,&quot; which are large, lightly regulated investment poolsthat aggressively move billions of dollars from market tomarket. Salomon, in its report on the scandal, mentionedseveral large hedge funds -- including Steinhardt PartnersL.P., Tiger Management Co. and Quantum Fund -- though nonehas been charged with any wrongdoing and none was mentionedin yesterday's report.   &quot;Events in the government-securities market have shownthat their capacity for leverage allows hedge funds to takelarge trading positions disproportionate to their creditbase,&quot; the report says. &quot;The sheer size of the positionstaken by the hedge funds raises concerns about systemic riskthat these funds may introduce into the financial markets.&quot;   The report also discloses that the Treasury has turnedover to the SEC the names of participants in several&quot;schemes&quot; for noncompetitive auction bids, in which smallinvestors can buy up to $5 million of auctioned notes orbonds at the average yield. The Treasury said that firmssubmitted bids in the names of employees or customers, thenkept the securities for the firms' accounts. The target firmstold the Treasury that the bids were proper, the report says.   The New York Fed's plan to pull back from the market willforce dealers to retreat from trading blindly with otherinvestors, said Stephen Thieke, president of J.P. MorganSecurities Inc. and the head of a Public SecuritiesAssociation panel on emerging issues. &quot;That's going to be areal challenge,&quot; he said. &quot;I never know who my counterpartyis&quot; in the current interdealer trading system.   Moreover, as the Fed reduces the barriers to entering theprimary-dealer system, &quot;I am going to be exposed to a wholenew set of firms I may not want to trade with,&quot; he said.   Clearly, the report's most controversial conclusions arethe Treasury's plans to sell more securities when needed tohead off &quot;acute and prolonged&quot; squeezes and to experimentwith a radically different auction system.   In the past, the Treasury has refused to reopen auctionsin severe squeezes, fearing that it would set a precedent ofhaving traders call for reopenings and hurt the Treasury byforcing bidders to be more cautious as they watched for moredebt to be sold on the market.   &quot;We've come to the conclusion that a reopening policy willbe a net positive for the market,&quot; said Jerome Powell, theassistant Treasury secretary who headed the task force. &quot;Wehave in mind here a very few, rare cases in which this actionwould be justified.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
