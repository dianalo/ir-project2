This prototype is analyzed fromtwo standpoints. First is the role of natural language for command andcontrol, its realistic requirements, and how well the role can be filledwith current practical technology. It is shown that natural languagetechniques are particularly useful in providing full functionality througha voice interface. Second, technical concepts for achieving the abovegoals are discussed and illustrated by their application in the prototypesystem. Methods are presented for organizing communication between thenatural language processing and the control applications so that most&quot;language&quot; knowledge is in the language processor, and new domains canbe easily accommodated. The main job of the language processor is viewedas identifying primitive actions and objects, even when vaguely specified.Lastly, the custom processor is contrasted with a commercially availablenatural language system.</TEXT></DOC>
