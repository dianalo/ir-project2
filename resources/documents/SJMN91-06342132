When I asked him for a spare key, he said that Ididn't have the right to enter his apartment without giving him 24-hour noticeand that there was no need for me to have a key. Do I have the right to aspare key in case of an emergency?;   A There is no law that requires yourtenant to give you a key to the apartment.;   Nevertheless, under Civil CodeSection 1954, you do have the right to enter the unit in an emergency withoutgiving 24-hour notice. In the event of a broken pipe or a fire in his unit, itwould be difficult for you to enter without a key. If you must force entry inan emergency because your tenant does not provide you with a key, you areentitled to collect from the tenant for any resulting damage to your property,including damage to the door itself.;   Explain to your tenant that you areaware of his right to privacy and that you do not intend to enter his unitwithout giving him sufficient notice. Despite his concerns, you havelegitimate rights in emergency situations where he may not be available toprovide access to the unit. Explain that preventing damage to the building mayalso protect his stereo and video equipment.;   To avoid situations such asyours, many owners include a clause in their rental agreements that prohibitstenants from changing the locks.;   If your tenant has a month-to-monthagreement, you may add such a provision; since your tenant has alreadyinstalled a new lock, you may also add a clause that requires him to provideyou with a spare key. You will have to wait 30 days for the clause to becomevalid.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911207  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  509  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, December 7, 199100342132,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
