Meanwhile, Boeing may be close to a sale of about 60 757s, divided evenly between firm orders and options, to Allegis Corp.'s United Airlines unit, according to individuals familiar with the transaction. The 757 model sells for about $40 million. With spare parts and training, the value of the United sale could be about $2.67 billion, the individuals said. The deal could be announced as early as the Allegis annual meeting tomorrow.    A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the American order. An Allegis spokesman would say only that &quot;we have some aging fleet types that need to be replaced.&quot;    American has scheduled a news briefing at 11 a.m. in New York by Robert Crandall, chairman, president and chief executive of AMR. Boeing, in an unusual step, also scheduled a news conference to announce a plane order at its Seattle headquarters, at 9 a.m. there. Neither of the companies would give details about the expected order.    Intense speculation about the two orders boosted Boeing's stock $2.125 to close at $53.875 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. That followed an increase of $1.25 on Monday, when Boeing was the third most active Big Board stock.    Such large orders for the 757 would help both the production rates and the image of the 186-seat aircraft. The 757 was designed with two engines and a two-person crew as an economical replacement for the aging Boeing 727, which has three engines and a three-person crew. But low fuel costs have encouraged airlines to hold on to their 727s. As a result, orders for the 757 have been slow in coming. Boeing has sold an average of only about 30 of the 757 model a year for the past nine years.    With the two expected orders, the 757 may be about to have its day, industry executives said. &quot;Very often this is what happens, that two or three operators will move simultaneously,&quot; said Morton Beyer, president of Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm in Arlington, Va. &quot;United is not going to let anybody one-up them, and the 757 is a very good airplane.&quot;    American's plans for financing its order weren't available. The carrier's last big Boeing order, a leasing arrangement for 15 of the 767 model, was described by industry executives as containing terms that were very favorable to American. A Boeing executive recently said the aircraft maker probably wouldn't enter into a leasing deal like that again.    American has said it needs new aircraft to replace the 164 727s still in its fleet, as well as some 737s the carrier received when it acquired Air Cal.    United would use its 757s to replace its DC-8s, which seat 194 people, the industry sources said. United has only 29 of the aircraft, but the carrier has been looking to expand its fleet. The DC-8s, which have a market value of about $10 million, probably would be sold to package carrier companies, the sources said.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Allegis closed at $81.25, up $1. AMR closed at $40, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
