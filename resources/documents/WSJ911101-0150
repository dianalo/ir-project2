Thischaracteristic is in evidence right from the start of Mr.Lovesey's new book, &quot;The Last Detective&quot; (PerfectCrime/Doubleday, 331 pages, $18.50). Known for his periodmysteries, including two series set in the Victorian era, Mr.Lovesey has now written his first completely contemporarynovel. But Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond, the book'stitular hero, sees himself as a relic of an earlier time.Diamond looks back with yearning to a day when policemen gotresults not from tapping at computers but from knocking ondoors.   The perplexing case confronting Diamond is the murder ofGeraldine Snoo, a former television soap opera actress foundfloating in Bristol's Chew Valley Lake. Was Ms. Snoo done inby her husband, Prof. Jackman, the English instructor withthe look of a champion tennis player? Was the professoradulterously involved with Dana Didrikson, mother of a12-year-old boy he saved from drowning? And what has any ofthis to do with two rare holograph letters gone missing fromJackman's &quot;Jane Austen in Bath&quot; exhibit?</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Lovesey maintains a wonderful tone throughout, pitchedsomewhere between the ring of truth and the call of the loon.Narrative sections shift from third to first person,heightening interest and keeping the reader pleasantlyoff-balance. The portly Detective Diamond initially seems afigure of fun but turns out to be something quite different.A comedy of bad manners, full of oddball characters and wackyevents, develops into a perfectly realized murder mysterywhose skillful misdirection never oversteps the bounds offair play.   Another English writer hailed for his wit is JonathanGash, who chronicles the exploits of a roguish antiquesexpert named Lovejoy. &quot;The Great California Game&quot; (St.Martin's Press, 249 pages, $19.95) is the 14th Lovejoyadventure. It brings its trouble-prone hero for the firsttime to America, and is timed to coincide with the new seasonof Lovejoy shows on Aandamp;E.   Despite its title, the book is set mostly in Manhattan,where Lovejoy has landed having escaped from Hong Kong at theend of 1989 and found temporary cover tending bar at anEighth Avenue eatery. But it isn't long before Lovejoy'spassion for antiques betrays him as a &quot;divvy&quot; -- someone withan almost preternatural ability to tell the real from thefake. His services are drafted by a spooky cartel ofbig-money types who are involved in an annual card tourneywith surrealistically high stakes.   Business tycoons, politicians, socialites and churchfigures are the cutthroat high rollers in a game funded by acomplex and fantastic scheme. Blackmailed into being a spy aswell as a divvy, Lovejoy improvises a perilous path through ashifting maze of double- and triple-crosses, journeying froma subterranean lair where hoods monitor above-ground crimevia closed-circuit television, to a religious theme parkpresided over by husband-and-wife evangelists, to thepenthouse office of a Big Apple real estate developer andcasino operator. After a New Orleans detour, Lovejoyeventually winds up in Malibu, site of the book's explosivenear-finale.   Lovejoy is at his best when he's appreciating the objectsthat mean so much to him -- the candlesticks, the Constables.But the book's bewildering number of characters and somewhatpreposterous plot make us wish for a speedy return to morefamiliar turf.   A whole planeload of English (and other European) citizensabandon their homeland for the U.S. in Ken Follett's latestthriller, &quot;Night Over Water&quot; (Morrow, 400 pages, $23). Thetime: September 1939, just after Britain has declared war onGermany. The setting: a Pan Am Flying Clipper, a luxuryairliner that sleeps 40 and crosses the Atlantic in a singleday. All those on board this airborne Ship of Fools areescaping various political and social entanglements.   There's Lord Oxenford, prominent British fascist, who isleaving the U.K. with his family to avoid arrest. Oxenford'sidealistic 19-year-old daughter, Margaret, hopes to elude hertyrannical father's rule once they're in the States. HarryMarks, thief on the lam, is equally smitten with Margaret andwith her mother's jewels. Carl Hartmann, Jewish physicist, isfleeing the Nazis. Beautiful Diana Lovesey is running awayfrom her gruff industrialist husband to begin a new life withan American boyfriend.   Other components in the mix include an FBI agent and hisgangster prisoner, a flight engineer whose wife is being heldcaptive by thugs and a businesswoman racing to Manhattan tokeep control of her company.   There's some bumpiness in the initial pages, as thestory's engines shudder into action. But once the multipleplots' propellers are spinning, Mr. Follett keeps a sure handon the controls. Paying passengers are guaranteed lots ofaccurate period detail, 12 narrow escapes, half a dozeninstances of unspeakable treachery, an equal number ofcourageous acts and at least two violent deaths before thebig Boeing B-314 makes its final watery touchdown.</TEXT></DOC>
