McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Commercial banks could be headed toward arecord one-year gain in earnings with the government reporting theirhighest six-month earnings ever and $7 billion in profits in thesecond quarter of 1989.   ``I think the industry has a chance to beat last year's all-timerecord earnings,'' Chairman L. William Seidman of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. said Wednesday as the agency posted theApril-June earnings report.   But Seidman cautioned that the year's earnings figures could bedampened by troubles involving Third World debt, real estate loansand the state of the economy.   Commercial banks recorded profits of $25.1 billion in 1988.   The FDIC, which insures bank deposits, said profits at the 12,944commercial banks in the second quarter were down from the record$7.3 billion in the January-March period. But, both quarterscombined totaled $14.3 billion, topping all previous six-monthrecords.   Banks increased their real estate lending by 12.8 percent whileboosting commercial lending by only 2.2 percent, the FDIC reportsaid.   Second quarter profits rose in 39 states, the District ofColumbia and Puerto Rico, but fell in 11 states, according to JohnJ. Quinn III, FDIC senior banking analyst.   Among those states reporting falling profits were Connecticut,Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.   ``Overall, we're seeing a shift of problems from the Southwest tothe Northeast, but the Northeast has nowhere near the kind ofproblems the Southwest has experienced in recent years'' followingthe decline in oil prices, Seidman said at a briefing.   The FDIC report said the ``increase in non-performing assets inthe Eastern regions has come from troubled loans to developingcountries and real estate.''   The report added, ``recent trends in Southwest bank performancesuggest that the prolonged deterioration of that region's bankingsector may have finally ended.''   But, it pointed out, ``Southwest banks still have the highestpercentage of non-performing assets, more than twice the nationalaverage, as well as the highest percentage of banks on the FDIC's`Problem List.'''   And despite the profits, banks continued to fail at a high rate.The FDIC said 101 banks have failed or required governmentassistance this year, the same number as in the first half of 1988.For all of last year, a post-Depression record of 221 failed.   The FDIC said the 12,944 banks operating at the end of June was arecord low since the agency was created in 1934. In addition to thebank failures, it attributed the low number to fewer new banks andthe conversion of multibank holding company subsidiaries intobranches.   But it said the number of ``problem banks'' has slipped to 1,356,the lowest level in four years and down from 1,455 a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
