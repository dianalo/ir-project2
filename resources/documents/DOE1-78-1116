Surface-bound anions were formed by adsorption of the salts.Alternatively, the surface-bound ion pair [HRuOs{sub 3}(CO){sub 13}]{sup-}{Al} was formed from [H{sub 2}RuOs{sub 3}(CO){sub 13}] by deprotonationon the surface; the anion is bonded to the surface through a bridgingcarbonyl group interacting with a surface Lewis acid site (Al{sup 3+}ion). This surface anion is readily converted at 50-70{sup 0}C into [H{sub3}RuOs{sub 3}(CO){sub 12}]{sup -}{Al}, evidently by reacting with surfacewater. The latter anion is also formed by deprotonation of [H{sub 4}RuOs{sub3}(CO){sub 12}] on the surface. [H{sub 3}RuOs{sub 3}(CO){sub 12}]{sup-}{Al} is the precursor of a catalyst for isomerization of but-1-eneto give cis- and trans-but-2-ene at 53-77{sup 0}C. The catalytic activityand the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics parameters were the same, whetherthe catalyst was prepared by adsorption of [Et{sub 4}][H{sub 3}RuOs{sub3}(CO){sub 13}] or from [H{sub 2}RuOs{sub 3}(CO){sub 13}], convertedinto [HRuOs{sub 3}(CO){sub 13}]{sup -}{Al} and then into [H{sub 3}RuOs{sub3}(CO){sub 12}]{sup -}{Al}. The catalyst was stable for andgt;2000 turnovers.Infrared spectra showed that [H{sub 3}RuOs{sub 3}(CO){sub 12}]{sup -}{Al}was the predominant surface organometallic species on the working catalyst.When the catalyst was used instead for ethylene hydrogenation, the activitychanged as the cluster was degraded; metal particles were formed, andthese and/or mononuclear metal complexes are the likely catalytic species.</TEXT></DOC>
