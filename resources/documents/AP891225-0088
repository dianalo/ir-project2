A cold front nosed into the northern Plains region and the upperMississippi Valley during the afternoon, kicking up snow and gustywind that sharply reducing visibility in some areas.   Squalls associated with the cold front produced heavy snow alongthe shoreline of Lake Superior, and up to 12 inches of new snow waspossible by Tuesday in parts of western and central Upper Michigannear the lakeshore, the weather service said.   A weak storm system brought light snow to the Tennessee Valleyearly Monday and snow flurries were reported as far south as thecentral Gulf Coast.
