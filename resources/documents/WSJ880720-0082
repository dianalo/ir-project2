In the year-earlier quarter, a tax credit of $319,000 made final net $1,232,000, or 16 cents a share.    The company also said operating income grew 35% as revenue surged by 88% in the quarter. The maker of high-powered business computers has been selling bigger and costlier machines. In the latest quarter, Sequent shipped 84 systems, and all but nine were the company's top-of-the-line Symmetry models, the company said, while last year it sold 38 systems, all of them less-powerful Balance models.    For the quarter, the company expects to report an operating income of $1,237,000, or 15 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier operating income of $913,000, or 12 cents a share.    Revenue in the quarter was $17,127,000 , compared with $9,070,000 a year earlier. The 1988 per-share figures were based on 8,180,000 outstanding shares, and the 1987 per-share figures were based on 7,520,000 outstanding shares.    Casey Powell, president and chief executive officer, noted that the year-ago figures for the quarter include $1 million in both revenue and net from licensing its computer technology to others, while the 1988 results didn't include any technology revenue.    For the six months, Sequent expects to report that operating income grew 40% to $2,177,000, or 27 cents a share, from the year earlier operating income of $1,560,000, or 23 cents a share. A tax credit of $350,000 in the 1988 period made final net $2,527,000, or 31 cents a share, and in the year-ago period, a tax-credit of $497,000 made final net $2,057,000, or 30 cents a share.    For the first half, revenue grew 89% to $31,370,000 from $16,619,000 in the 1987 period. The 1988 per-share figures were based on 8,142,000 average shares outstanding compared with 6,787,000 shares in the 1987 period. Also, according to Mr. Powell, the 1987 first-half figures reflected $2 million in both revenue and net from licensing its technology to others. Sequent didn't realize any revenue or net from technology licensing in the 1988 period. </TEXT></DOC>
