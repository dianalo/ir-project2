There were significant decreases in in vitro intestinal Ca transportin animals exposed to Cd for 2 or 3 months as compared with controls.Ca transport from everted gut sacs of normal rats showed a dose-dependentdecrease. /sup 45/Ca-binding activity to intestinal mucosa from Cd-exposedrats showed a lower level of decrease than that on control rat mucosa.The typical peak of Cd-binding protein obtained from Sephadex G-100 gelfiltration of /sup 109/Cd added to mucosal supernatant agreed with resultsof gel filtration obained after /sup 45/Ca had been added to the samesupernatant. Although there were 2 proteins binding Cd or Ca in the intestinalmucosa, with the same molecular weight of 10,000, these proteins wereshown to be different, since Cd did not bind with the Ca protein. Itwas concluded that inhibition of vitamin-D-non-stimulated Ca transportwas not caused by Cd bound to Ca-binding protein, but by some other factor.40 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
