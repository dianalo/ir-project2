As a general matter, these Federal standards preempt State andlocal standards and any other State and local requirements with respectto energy efficiency or energy use of these products. Among other things,NAECA requires DOE to consider amending the energy conservation standardsfor refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers; to establish standardsfor small gas furnaces; and to consider establishing energy conservationstandards for television sets.In accordance with NAECA, the Department has reviewed possible standardsfor refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers, small gas furnacesand television sets as discussed in today's notice of proposed rulemaking.For refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers, the Department isproposing a range of standards that includes not increasing the stringencyof the standard level. DOE is soliciting comments and information fromthe public to be considered in promulgating the final rule. As discussedin the proposed rule, the final rule will specify a specific level forrefrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers.For small gas furnaces, the Department is proposing to determine that standardswould result in a significant conservation of energy and be economicallyjustified. Therefore, the Department is today proposing to amend 10 CFRPart 430 to add standards for this product.Finally, for television sets, the Department is proposing to determinethat an energy conservation standard would result in a significant conservationof energy but would not be economically justified. Therefore, the Departmentis proposing to amend Part 430 to include a determination of no standardfor television sets.Based on an Environmental Assessment (EA), DOE has determined that noneof the proposed standards, including the ``no standard'' for televisionsets, are a major federal action significantly affecting the quality ofthe human environment within the meaning of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA). Therefore an Environmental Impact Statement will notbe prepared. The EA is part of the Technical Support Document for the proposedstandards and is available on request at the following address.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Availability</ITAG>Hearings and Dockets Branch, Office of Conservation and Renewable Energy,U.S. Department of Energy, Docket Number CE-RM-87-102, 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Room 6B-025, Washington, DC 20585: (202) 586-9320.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Michael J.

L. 91-190, 40 U.S.C. 4221 <T3>et seq., </T3>and the implementing regulations of the Council on EnvironmentalQuality (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1808). The EA addresses the possibleincremental environmental effects attributable to the application of theproposed standards to the design of refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,and freezers; and small gas furnaces. The EA also looked at the impactof energy conservation standards for television sets. As discussed in theGeneral Findings, the ``no standard'' standard for televisions will notchange the status quo and therefore will not result in any environmentalimpact. The effect of the proposed standards range from no change to aslight improvement in the outdoor environment as discussed in the GeneralFindings below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Approach Used in the Analysis</ITAG>This assessment evaluates the environmental impacts resulting from theproposed setting of new or amended energy-efficiency standards for refrigerators,refrigerator-freezers, freezers, and small gas furnaces and the proposedsetting of no standards for television sets in accordance with the NAECA.A complete description of the Engineering and Economic Analysis of theproposed standards may be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD).The two main environmental concerns addressed are emissions from fossilfuel fired electricity generation and the chlorofluorocarbons used in theproduction of rigid insulation foam.Four of the fourteen scenarios for product design changes described inthe Engineering Analysis of the TSD were chosen for study based on theirrelative importance as design measures. Values for energy savings thatresult from product design changes are also taken from the TSD.An in-depth analysis of particulate emissions is not included in this assessmentbecause particulate emissions are relatively small compared to sulfur andnitrogen oxide emissions. Current electricity generating methods are farcleaner than those of the past. In 1984, power plants contributed only7 percent of U.S. total particulate emissions as compared to contributionsof 83 percent and 34 percent to total SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2> emissions, respectively (EPA, 1986).<ITAG tagnum="84">General Findings</ITAG>1. Refrigerators, Refrigerator-Freezers and Freezers The proposed standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezersrange from retaining the federally mandated standards contained in NAECA,up to three more stringent standards. The greatest impacts of the proposedstandards, other than the minimum NAECA standards, are the result of generatingless electricity. Power plants' main environmental effects on air and waterresult from emissions of sulfur oxides (SO<T2>x</T2>), nitrogen oxides (NO<T2>x</T2>), and carbon dioxide (CO<T2>2</T2>). All SO<T2>x</T2> and NO<T2>x</T2>, emissions are expressed in the equivalent weights of SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2>, respectively. Carbon dioxide emissions are commonly expressedas tons of carbon. Additionally, there would be some shifting of CFC use.General findings are summarized below: <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Sulfur Dioxide </ITAG>The greatest decrease in air pollution will occur for sulfur dioxide. Thepossible reductions range from no change up to 151,000 tons or 0.9 percentof the U.S. SO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted by power plants by the year2010 for the most stringent standard proposed.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The upper levels are interpolated from data in Table 5.8of the Technical Support Document for energy savings and Tables 1, 2, 5,and 6 of the Environmental Assessment for pollutant reductions. The interpolationis made between standard level 1 (engineering level 3) and standard level4 (engineering level 8). <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Nitrogen Dioxide </ITAG>The possible reductions in NO<T2>2</T2> range from no change up to 100,000 tons or 1.0 percent of thetotal NO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted by power plants by the year2010 for the most stringent standard proposed.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Ibid.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Carbon Dioxide </ITAG>The possible reductions in CO<T2>2</T2> range from no change up to the equivalent of 9,180,000 tonsor 0.2 percent of the worldwide CO<T2>2</T2> emissions for the year 2010 for the most stringent standardproposed.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Ibid. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Chlorofluorocarbons </ITAG>An additional effect of some design change scenarios is an increased consumptionof CFC's. CFC-11 is contained in the rigid foam insulation used in theappliances and CFC-12 is the heat exchange fluid used in refrigeratorsand freezers. The possible increased use ranges from no change to one percentof the 1985 total United States CFC-11 and CFC-12 consumption for the moststringent standards proposed. However, since CFC production has been limited,any extra consumption would have to come from other uses and would notresult in a net increase in CFC production. None of the environmental impacts from the savings of SO<T2>2</T2>, NO<T2>2</T2>, or CO<T2>2</T2> from the range of proposed standards are considered to be significant.2. Small Gas FurnacesThe greatest impact of the proposed standard for small gas furnaces isa decrease in electricity consumption as some households shift from electricheating to small gas furnaces and decreases in gas and oil burned in homes.General findings are summarized below: <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Sulfur Dioxide </ITAG>The reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> would be 6800 tons or 4.2 percent of the emissions estimatedto come from residential fuel combustion during 2010. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Nitrogen Dioxide </ITAG>The reduction in NO<T2>2</T2> would be 5100 tons or 1.3 percent of the emissions estimatedto come from residential fuel combustion during 2010. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Carbon Dioxide </ITAG>The reduction in CO<T2>2</T2> would be equivalent to 569,000 tons of carbon or .01 percentof the worldwide CO<T2>2</T2> emissions for the year 2010. None of the environmental impacts from the savings of SO<T2>2</T2>, NO<T2>2</T2>, or CO<T2>2</T2> from the proposed standard are considered to be significant.3. Television Sets The proposed ``no standard'' standard for television sets results in noimpact on the environment since it will not change the status quo. DOEis unaware of any State or local energy conservation standards concerningtelevision sets that would be preempted by the ``no standard'' standard.The only state standard for television sets of which DOE is aware is theNew York State standard that bans the ``instant-on'' feature of tube typetelevisions. However, since tube type television sets are no longer manufactured,such standards currently have no effect. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determination </ITAG>Based upon the EA, DOE has determined that the proposed interim standardsdo not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the qualityof the human environment, within the meaning of NEPA. Therefore, an EnvironmentalImpact Statement is not required. <ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, November 7, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ernest C.
