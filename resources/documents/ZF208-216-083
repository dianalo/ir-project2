 The353-year-old institution that prides itself on providing the highest degreeof higher education, is itself getting an education in the nuances ofnetworking, as it becomes entwined in the down-to-earth realities of theelectronic age.andM;The land of the Crimson and White is getting a fiber optic backbone andbracing for the installation of some 22,000 new communications lines.andP;  Thoselines, which will lead to a future high-speed data network (HSDN), will reachout to some 350 university buildings scattered over a five-mile radius.andP;  Mostof those 22,000 lines will go into 180 campus buildings, which are beingcompletely rewired.andP;  Roughly 7,000 of the lines will go into studentfacilities, while the remaining 15,000 will serve the faculty and staff.andM;Thanks to the new network, Harvard students, staff and faculty will soon beable to tap into a range of telecommunications services, the mostsophisticated offerings coming via Integrated Services Digital Networks(ISDN) capabilities.andP;  Orchestrating and overseeing all of those offerings atHarvard is Morris Murphy, associate director of the Office for InformationTechnology.andM;A man for all systems, Murphy came to Harvard in 1985 after working 15 yearsat Polaroid Corp.andP;  Moving from the corporate to the college world seems tohave taught Murphy some lessons.andP;  To learn about those lessons and the HSDNhighways being built at Harvard, DATAMATION recently interviewed Murphy onthe banks of the Charles River.andM;Q: How did Harvard's telecommunications network evolve?andM;A: Based on interviews and a questionnaire, we came up with an architecturein the fall of 1986 that envisioned a high-speed data network that would sitabove the other university networks, acting as a king of network of networks.andO;Beneath that would sit a digital voice data switch to handle all of the voicenetworking in the university.andP;  This switch would also handle data networkingwhere appropriate.andP;  Also sitting beneath the high-speed data net would bevarious data centers and local area networks [LANs] that we except willcommunicate directly to the HSDN.andM;Q: Where do network developments stand now at Harvard?andM;A: We are now installing the No.andP;  5 ESS switch that we are leasing under a10-year contract with NYNEX.andP;  It will be a phased implementation over thenext six months.andP;  The switch is sort of a Centrax-like offering that NYNEXcalls Intellipath.andP;  We are putting in our own telecommunications facilitiesmanagement systems, and we're also installing our own fiber optic backbone.andO;And by next month we will have either issued an RFP [request for proposal] orfinalized the technical specifications for the high-speed data network.andM;Q: What type of network services will be available over the new network?andM;A: The network is a university utility.andP;  We are not going to force people touse one particular set of services or one single offering.andP;  The commitmentwe've made to people throughout the university is that, at the very least, wewill give them like for like.andP;  In other words, they can replace whateverthey've got now with something that will be the equivalent on the newnetwork.andP;  And if in fact they want to subscribe to enhanced services on thesingle-line voice set, they will be able to.andP;  So, things like voice mail willbe available as an optional enhanced service on the voice network.andM;We also have a group that offers service support for LAN consulting,installation and maintenance.andP;  And we will be encouraging people who eitherhave LANs or are installing LANs to take advantage of the high-speed datanetwork.andP;  This would give them access to external gateways and to otherservices throughout the university.andP;  Of course, LAN users could also haveaccess to the HSDN through the Integrated Services Digital Networkcapabilities of the No.andP;  5 ESS switch.andM;Q: Do you see particular applications evolving for particular segments of theHarvard community?andM;A: The administrative people would probably have more of a need to accesscentral databases for their administrative files and financial, budget andpurchasing systems.andP;  As more of its files go on line, the library may want tooffer students access to its catalog, either through the high-speed datanetwork or through the ISDN capabilities of the switch.andM;I would envision the faculty using things like voice mail to get messagesfrom students.andP;  They may also want to use their systems to distributeassignments and notes and accept work.andP;  In other words, they could begin touse a network to do any and all of the clerical and &quot;sneakernet&quot; types ofthings they currently do with students or with their peers outside theuniversity.andP;  We're trying to extend our network beyond the walls of theuniversity.andP;  The Northeast Academic Research Network [NEARNET] is one way todo that.andM;Q: What is the purpose of NEARNET?andM;A: Harvard, Boston University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,the three founders of NEARNET, got together because they felt the need toestablish a regional New England network that would be similar to NYSERNETdown in New York.andP;  This woule enable them to network with each other, and itwould also provide a springboard for access to the supercomputer centers foracademic and research information sponsored by the National ScienceFoundation.andM;Q: Do you see developments in networking at the university level mirroringwhat's going on in the corporate world?andM;A: I see some similarities and dissimilarities.andP;  While the two sectors aresimilar in most respects, I think the major differences come on the wide areanetworking side.andP;  Any major corporation has to have networking that isnationwide, as well as worldwide.andP;  In a university, which is moreself-contained, you also need wide area networking, but it isn't thelife-blood of the organization as it is in the corporate world.andP;  Withoutdistributed networks, a company's order entry systems wouldn't work, itswarehouses would come to a standstill and sales couldn't even be reported.andP;  Auniversity, on the other hand, whose business is either research oreducation, isn't under the gun to distribute that research today.andM;Q: Both corporations and colleges have to take steps to ensure networksecurity.andP;  How is Harvard dealing with the security issue?andM;A: Many universities actually have less security concerns than corporations.andO;And again, that's because the primary nature of the work is research, whichis available to anyone.andP;  In fact, when I first came to Harvard, I was shockedto discover what appeared to be a lack of security in some of the networking.andO;The same precautions aren't needed because information is open to the world,and there's no particular importance attached to who sees what.andO;Nevertheless, there tend to be more people at a university who have time ontheir hands and who want to crack security for the sheer fun of it.andP;  Thereare more of these types of people in universities than in corporations.andM;Q: Are you saying, then, that network security is a potential problem atHarvard?andM;A: No.andP;  Security is not a major problem at Harvard.andP;  But I say that withtongue in cheek because, even as we speak, there's one particular problemthat's plaguing us.andP;  We have a trace on three lines because there's somebodyfooling around inside one of the major data centers here.andP;  They've brokenthrough what this data center thought was some pretty good security.andP;  It justhappened last weekend.andP;  We think it's under control now.andM;Q: Even further in the future, what do you see on the networking horizon?andM;A: I envision network capacity becoming a commodity, just as computing hasbecome a commodity.andP;  The power of three IBM 1401 computers, mammoth machinesthat used to fill up an entire room 20 years ago, can now be found sitting onmy desktop in one personal computer.andP;  That same magnitude of advancement thatoccurred in the computing field is now happening in networking technology.andO;We are building the highways today that will lead to those advances tomorrow.andM;Q: How will those advances change the lives of university students?andM;A: Through networking technology, we hope to enrich their lives, enhancetheir educational experience, by letting them access the data they need tofrom where they actually are.andP;  The technology would let them make fastcontact with their professors and [allow for] quick turnaround and responsein study chores, all of which could save them valuable time so that theycould do more.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
