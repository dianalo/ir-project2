Dukakis aides, careful not to criticize the civil rights leader,point out that Dukakis will likely secure the nomination when theprimary season concludes on June 7 and thus will be negotiatingwith Jackson from a position of strength. They said Dukakis willnot make concessions that could hurt his chances against certainRepublican nominee George Bush.   ``Our negotiating position will be very strong,'' Dukakisspokesman Leslie Dach said in an interview Thursday. ``Our ultimategoal is to resolve our differences as much as we can. But we're notgoing to negotiate our basic stands. You're not going to see anykind of fundamental shifts.''   On the stump, Jackson contends he is swaying Dukakis. ``He isadjusting to a new agenda,'' Jackson told a California rally onThursday.   But in reality, Dukakis has rejected many Jackson proposals,including his calls for defense cuts and higher taxes for thewealthy and large corporations.   Dukakis aides also say a national health insurance proposalespoused by Jackson is far more expensive than an employer-fundedprogram backed by Dukakis, who also has rejected Jackson's call forspending $2.5 billion to improve education programs. ``We simplydon't feel there is the money there to spend,'' said Dukakis issuesadviser Tom Herman.   For now, Dukakis aides say they will confine the public debateover Dukakis-Jackson differences to public statements of thecandidates and ongoing discussions over the convention platform.   ``We hope they will reach as many agreements as they can andwhen that process is further along it will be time to go back seewhere our differences are,'' Dach said. ``We're very comfortablethat we will be at the convention with a very clear workingmajority.''   While the Dukakis campaign hopes to avoid public feuding or afallout with Jackson, it is at the same time sending subtle signalsto Jackson and expanding its outreach to black voters in caseJackson refuses to support Dukakis. Up to 100 black Dukakissupporters from across the country are scheduled to meet in Bostonon Monday to discuss a fall strategy.   ``I hope everybody has the same sense heading into thisconvention,'' Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said whenasked about potential conflicts with Jackson. ``There is a realsense that we Democrats can win. Bush has real vulnerabilities.   ``We Democrats, if we don't shoot ourselves in the foot, can winand I don't think there is anybody in our party who wants to wakeup the day after the election and have it said that if it wasn'tfor him we would have won.''   Estrich met with Jackson convention manager Ron Brown this weekand speaks frequently with her counterpart in the Jackson campaign,Gerald Austin. She refuses to discuss the substance of the talks.   Dukakis convention manager Marcia Hale also has scheduledmeetings with Brown, and the candidates themselves met privatelyWednesday following a debate in California.   ``Would I like to see a peaceful convention? Yes,'' Hale said.``But there are lots of negotiations that need to take place.''   Brown, in a telephone interview Friday, said: ``There might besome items that compromise cannot be found on. But I'm not preparedto say what our priority issues will be. ... There have not beenany substantive conversations on platform issues.''   He disputed the Dukakis aides' boast about negotiating strength.   ``We don't expect that anyone will have a nominating majority ofthe delegates when we go into the convention,'' Brown said. Despitethat position, it appears very likely Dukakis will have the 2,081delegates needed for nomination.   Dukakis aides insist their convention planning is just beginningbut say Jackson will have a major role. The Dukakis camp also isexpected to seek to appease Jackson by agreeing to a strongstatement denouncing apartheid in South Africa and supportingsanctions against the country, although it is unclear whetherDukakis wants such a statement as part of the platform or whetherhe will agree with Jackson's demand that South Africa be designateda terrorist state.   ``There are significant differences and they represent realpolicy disagreements,'' Dach said. ``But they trust each other andthey share a common goal. ... We want his support. It's obviouslycritical support.''</TEXT></DOC>
