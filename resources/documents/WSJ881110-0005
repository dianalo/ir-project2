At the same time, Congressional Democrats, who also scored big victories in Tuesday's election, will be sending the president an unequivocal message: If he won't propose taxes, they won't cut a budget deal. &quot;Spending cuts alone can't solve the problem,&quot; says House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski. &quot;Unless we bite the bullet and work out a fair plan to raise revenues, the threat will grow.&quot;    But if Mr. Bush gives in on taxes, his advisers say, it could be political suicide. &quot;He won't raise taxes,&quot; says New Hampshire Governor John Sununu, a Bush political confidant. &quot;He doesn't have to, and he said he wouldn't, so he won't.&quot;    The likely result? Budgetary gridlock, a possible financial crisis, and a presidency besieged almost immediately by pressing domestic and international economic problems.    In his news conference yesterday, Mr. Bush repeated his pledge not to raise taxes. &quot;I don't plan to deviate,&quot; he said. Instead, he hopes to reduce the deficit without tax increases by holding down spending and encouraging economic growth.    But that could prove impossible, especially given the intransigence of Congress. And without a budget deal, business leaders, economists and even some of Mr. Bush's own economic advisers agree with Mr. Greenspan that financial instability could quickly follow. Wall Street and foreign markets discounted the vice president's tough anti-tax rhetoric during the campaign, assuming he would drop his &quot;Read my lips; no new taxes&quot; line after the election. But if the rhetoric proves to be real, &quot;you could have some real problems,&quot; says Citicorp Chairman John Reed.    &quot;If action is not taken by Easter,&quot; says economist C. Fred Bergsten, there would be &quot;a grave risk of a financial crisis,&quot; and he adds: &quot;That could lead to a recession.&quot;    Mr. Bush is expected to make a nod toward deficit concerns by moving quickly to appoint Richard Darman, a seasoned veteran of President Reagan's budget battles, to be the director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Darman believes that progress on deficit reduction is needed to keep financial markets calm. But he is also committed to uphold the vice president's no-tax campaign promise.    Bush advisers insist that they can reduce the deficit without a tax increase, but if they are wrong, they still might avoid a crisis.    The economy has survived six years of unprecedented budget deficits without an economic crisis; and it could survive four more. Most economists now see the deficit as a slow-acting disease that only gradually weakens the rise in the nation's living standards. &quot;There is nothing in this analysis that says some big blowout will occur,&quot; says Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman.    Moreover, even if President Bush can reach a budget agreement with Congress, there isn't any guarantee that he will avoid a recession. The current economic expansion is already the longest in peacetime history, and a cut in government spending or an increase in taxes might be enough to bring it to an end.    In fact, some analysts argue that as Mr. Bush takes office, economic turmoil faces him whichever way he turns. &quot;Reagan's timing was fantastic,&quot; says economist David Hale. &quot;Bush's timing is not.&quot;    The legacy of deficits and debt that Mr. Bush inherits will become his most irksome burden. More than any other modern president, he must heed the whims of foreign investors who are bankrolling the U.S. economic expansion. Should they lose confidence in his policies, says economist Lawrence Chimerine, &quot;you could see a period of real pressure on the dollar, followed by rising interest rates that could lead us to recession.&quot;    Many of the nation's top business leaders share that fear. &quot;If foreign nations see us going into a new administration that again shows no concept of a plan for how to deal with the deficit,&quot; says Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Peterson, &quot;I think that could do some very real and lasting harm.&quot;    Some of Mr. Bush's closest economic advisers agree. &quot;If the new president gives any signals that he is not serious about deficit reduction, it would have an adverse effect on the dollar,&quot; says a veteran of the Bush campaign who is likely to play an important role in the new administration's economic policies.    Mr. Bush will bow to deficit concerns, aides say, by following through on his call for a &quot;budget summit&quot; with Congress. &quot;He will sit down soon after his inauguration and be very much involved personally in deficit reduction with congressional leadership,&quot; says economics adviser Michael Boskin.    In his press conference yesterday, the president-elect gave a hint of some flexibility in his definition of prohibited &quot;taxes.&quot; Referring to the surtax on high-income elderly used to finance the new catastrophic health-care program, Mr. Bush said: &quot;I don't consider that taxes.&quot;    Still, Democratic leaders of Congress will be reluctant even to negotiate with the new president, much less reach agreement, given his adamant campaign stance against tax increases and cuts in Social Security. &quot;It's going to be difficult to make much headway in a so-called budget summit if taxes and Social Security are off the table,&quot; says House Majority Leader Thomas Foley. &quot;If you start writing off things before you sit down, it makes agreements extremely difficult.&quot;    And Tuesday night, even Republican leaders Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas and Rep. Robert Michel of Illinois raised questions about Mr. Bush's ability to deal with the deficit and keep his no-tax pledge. &quot;The American people don't want more taxes,&quot; said Sen. Dole, &quot;but let's face it: If we're going to put together a deficit-reduction package, someone is going to raise the question of revenue, and then the president-elect is going to have to come to grips with that.&quot; Sen. Dole's own presidential bid failed in the primaries after Mr. Bush attacked him for refusing to take the no-tax pledge.    Without raising revenues, says House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray, &quot;You're going to have budgetary gridlock, and the bottom is going to drop out of the economy.&quot;    The prospect for deficit reduction has also been clouded by the problems engulfing the National Economic Commission. That blue-ribbon panel was established by Congress last year in hopes of providing &quot;political cover&quot; to help the new president deal with the deficit. Its co-chairmen, Democrat Robert Strauss and Republican Drew Lewis, are aiming for a package of spending reductions and tax increases to cut the deficit by $50 to $80 billion a year.    But the panel is torn by internal dissension, and it has received little clear support from the Bush camp. The co-chairmen originally hoped to submit a report by Dec. 21; but with the chances of reaching agreement looking increasingly slim, they are now likely to delay the reporting date until next year.    &quot;Initially, I did have hope&quot; for the National Economic Commission, says Rep. Leon Panetta, the California Democrat who will chair the House Budget Committee next year. &quot;But there's been an almost deliberate effort to undercut its credibility, particularly when it comes to revenue issues.&quot;    If budget negotiations break down, the administration is also likely to face severe difficulties in negotiating with the &quot;G-7&quot; industrialized countries. Barring signs of progress on the deficit, the other nations may be less inclined to cooperate in efforts to coordinate economic policies and stabilize the dollar.    &quot;There will be a major window of opportunity early next year for the U.S. to do something about its budget deficit,&quot; says a foreign monetary official. &quot;If he does not use that opportunity, the new president will be taking a very major risk. . . . The markets, and other governments, are expecting action on the deficit. And that will be made clear to the U.S.&quot;    Failure on the budget front may make it difficult for the new president to get Congress to consider other domestic initiatives. Efforts to cut the tax rate on capital gains, for instance, are almost certain to be rebuffed by Congress in the absence of a larger deficit-reduction package.    Deficit problems could also eliminate any prospect for an easing of short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Mr. Greenspan and his Fed colleagues have repeatedly made it clear that large budget deficits are forcing them into a tighter policy than they might otherwise follow.    &quot;The new president is going to start out with his hands tied, unable to do anything unless he solves this problem,&quot; says Carol Cox, head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.    A growing surplus in the Social Security trust fund has papered over a large portion of the deficit in other programs. The surplus shrank last year's overall deficit to $155 billion from almost $200 billion. But the trust-fund surplus has made it tougher than ever to win support for cuts in the costly program for the elderly, which accounts for more than a quarter of all nondefense spending.    Growing political support for new spending programs will also make dealing with the deficit more difficult. After years of budget restraint, members of Congress are anxious to enact costly new programs for the ill and the homeless. And Mr. Bush added to the political problem during his campaign by promising more than $10 billion a year in new spending programs and tax breaks.    The deficit quandary leads many Washington observers to conclude that Mr. Bush will be forced to backtrack on his no-tax pledge. &quot;I'm willing to say to you: Read my lips; George Bush will ask for a tax increase in his first four years as president,&quot; says Democratic Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Polls show that most Americans agree.    Congressional Democrats say they may force Mr. Bush to ask for a tax increase -- and then refuse to go along. &quot;George Bush should consider the possibility that the Senate Finance Committee might decide to keep his promise for him,&quot; says Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. &quot;That would destroy his presidency.&quot;    With partisan tensions running so high, it may take a crisis to force action on the deficit. Last October's stock market crash persuaded President Reagan finally to abandon his 1984 pledge to not raise taxes; similar financial problems might nudge Mr. Bush and the Congress into action next year. &quot;In that context,&quot; says Harvard economist Richard Cooper, &quot;a crisis might actually be welcome.&quot;    Without a crisis, the crunch is likely to come next fall, when the threat of automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law begins to approach. Current budget-office estimates suggest $20 billion to $30 billion in spending cuts or tax increases will be needed to avoid the harsh, across-the-board cuts. Congress and the president will either have to find a way to make those changes, or vote to waive the Gramm-Rudman law. Sen. Bradley predicts gasoline and cigarette taxes will help fill the gap. But GOP Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon says the targets may need to be adjusted.    In any event, the choices aren't pleasant. Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, says that after surveying his economic quandary, President Bush may decide to spend his first year concentrating &quot;on an activist foreign policy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
