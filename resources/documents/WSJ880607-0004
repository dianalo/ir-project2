Moore (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JAPAN CANDA FREST EUROP </CO><IN> MON PCS CMD FRX </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Major British banks raised their base rates one-half percentage point to 8.5%, the second boost in four days, as U.K. authorities scrambled to stanch the pound's recent decline.    Separately, West Germany's central bank reportedly exchanged at least $2 billion for marks through covert channels in the foreign-exchange market in the last week of May.    A further increase in U.K. base rates had been expected since Friday's boost to 8% from 7.5%, their lowest level in a decade. Interbank credit markets had already discounted an additional one-half percentage point jump by midday, when the Bank of England signaled the latest rise by again lifting one of its main money-market intervention rates.    Within an hour, Barclays PLC, Lloyds Bank PLC and the London unit of Citicorp increased their base rates. The Barclays boost took effect immediately, while the other two banks' moves were effective at the close of business. Similar increases by National Westminster Bank PLC and Midland Bank PLC go into effect today. Base rates are the benchmark for commercial lending in Britain.    The pound was relatively stable before and after the adjustment -- a marked contrast with last week's rate boost that came amid tumult in foreign-exchange markets. After opening weaker at about 3.0875 marks from Friday's close of 3.0991 marks, the pound edged slightly above 3.10 marks in listless morning dealing. The base-rate increase lifted the British currency to 3.105 marks but it skidded to 3.0933 marks in late trading.    A Bank of England spokesman said Monday's action followed &quot;an overall assessment&quot; based on a range of economic factors that &quot;pointed to the need for a further rise in interest rate.&quot;    He declined to elaborate.    Traders and economists fretted that the pound's lingering weakness could drive U.K. base rates up again soon. &quot;It's still too early to put a floor on the downside for sterling,&quot; said Derek Walker, a Midland Bank economist. &quot;If sterling remains soft -- consistently below 3.10 marks -- there is a chance of another rate rise.&quot;    Gavyn Davies, chief U.K. economist for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in London, was more confident that the present level of exchange rates and interest rates could stand in the continuing &quot;cat-and-mouse game between the authorities and the (foreign-exchange) markets.&quot; The rate increases restore earlier differentials between British rates and lower rates prevailing in the U.S. and West Germany, he said.    Other analysts said the gradual narrowing of the rate gap was one reason for the pound's sudden fall last week. With the gap closing, sterling-denominated investments appeal less to investors.    Exchange rates stand at the same level as last March, when banks cut their base rates to 8.5%, Mr. Davies said. That combination was acceptable enough to provide extended exchange-rate stability earlier this year, he added. The combination may work again.    In West Germany, the Bundesbank said its net monetary reserves fell to 95.9 billion marks ($55.56 billion), down 3.4 billion marks, in the week ended May 31, almost exclusively from foreign-currency sales. As most of the central bank's foreign reserves are in dollars, the drop reflected a massive unwinding of dollar positions it had built in support of the U.S. currency in the past two years. Because currency transactions are booked with a two-day delay, some of the dollar sales weren't included in its weekly statement, the Bundesbank said.    Dealers said they were stunned by the volume of the sales and the discretion with which the central bank managed to undertake the transaction. Observers were unable to confirm any of the interventions outside the fixing, as the central bank apparently used back channels and swore its partners to secrecy, they said.    Dealers said they were also surprised by the dollar's strength last week in light of the Bundesbank's massive sales.    &quot;It shows how bullish the market is on the dollar,&quot; said Michael Schnirel, a foreign-exchange dealer at Irving Trust Co. in Frankfurt.    Without the Bundesbank's interventions, the dollar might have moved up even higher, other dealers added.    Analysts said the bank was taking advantage of the dollar's strength since midMay to reverse earlier currency interventions, which had bloated money supply.    By linking the small, but open dollar sales at the fixing with the massive covert transactions, the Bundesbank helped reinforce the myth of its own market power, said Giles Keating, economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. &quot;They wanted to create the impression that the limited interventions at the fixing had a strong impact on the market sentiment,&quot; he said. &quot;With that, they were successful.&quot;    Foreign-exchange dealers and analysts said they expect the Bundesbank to continue its dollar sales in coming days. The central bank is believed to hold an estimated 45 billion marks in dollar reserves in its accounts, far more than it would like to hold, dealers said.    In late afternoon New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.7136 marks from 1.7278 marks Friday. It fell to 125.78 yen from 125.98 yen.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 125.62 yen.    On New York's Commodity Exchange Monday, current-delivery gold settled at $462.90 an ounce, down $1.90. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $464.40 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   Late New York Trading                  Monday, June 6, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
