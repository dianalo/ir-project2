The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished 14.96 pointshigher at 2,597.13 after a sharp loss on Monday.   Wall Street observers said the Fed's addition of reserves to thebanking system through customer repurchase agreements sparked arise in the bond market that helped boost stock prices.   Investors interpreted the Fed's action as evidence that the nextmove could be an easing of the discount rate, said Michael Metz,equities analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. The discount rate is theinterest the central bank charges its member banks.   ``Investors were in the mood to listen to favorable rumors andseized on this as a rationalization to nibble a bit,'' said Metz,adding that such an interest rate move by the Fed was unlikely.   Investors hope for a decline in short-term interest rates torevive sagging corporate profitability in the fourth quarter,analysts said. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell47.34 points on what analysts said was a response to unexpectedlyweak third-quarter earnings reports and a bleak near-term outlook.   The yield on long-term Treasury bonds fell sharply after theFed's move, reflecting bond investors' optimism about a rate cut.The federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks charge eachother for overnight loans, also declined.   ``We finally got the turn that we needed to stimulate the stockmarket,'' said L. Crandall Hays, analyst with Robert W. Baird andamp; Co.   Stock prices opened weak then seesawed through the morningsession following the previous day's losses.
