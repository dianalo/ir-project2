ACOSTrecommends that Britain should abandon further research and developmenton gas-cooled reactors and concentrate wholeheartedly on the PWR, followingwhat it says is the public inquiry's unequivocal endorsement of the Sizewell-Bdesign. The Advisory Council also comments on the fast reactor, in thecontext of what it calls the Government's responsibility to underpinlong-term ventures in power generation. It states that the technologyis approaching commercialization.</TEXT></DOC>
