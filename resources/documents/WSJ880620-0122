Separately, Mr. Nobrega was quoted in the Brazilian press over the weekend as saying that a long-expected $62 billion debt rescheduling agreement with the country's foreign bank creditors could be signed &quot;any moment,&quot; following the resolution of a dispute over whether Brazilian reserves held outside the country should be liable to seizure in the event of any subsequent Brazilian debt moratorium. According to Mr. Nobrega, the immunity of these funds has been guaranteed by the banks. Bankers couldn't be reached immediately for comment.    On Friday, President Jose Sarney, breaking openly with the military for the first time, fired Brigadier Paulo Roberto Camarinha after the armed forces' chief of staff declared in an interview last week that Planning Minister Joao Batista de Abreu &quot;might as well stay at home.&quot;    Brig. Camarinha, a popular figure within the armed forces who has consitently voiced discontent over salary levels, also said Brazil's Constituent Assembly was rife with corruption and that the country's inflation rate was &quot;disgraceful.&quot; His criticism was the bluntest attack by a senior officer on the country's civilian rulers since the military ended two decades of rule in 1985.    Mr. Sarney's quick response indicated that he feels strengthened following a recent vote granting him a five-year mandate, and that his commitment to Messrs. Nobrega and Abreu is firm.    There was no immediate indication of any restiveness within the armed forces after Brig. Camarinha's dismissal, although he was defiantly cheered and greeted with cries of &quot;Camarinha for president&quot; when he left his office for the last time. Political sources said Mr. Sarney received firm expressions of support from the ministers of the army, navy and air force.    Pay levels have been a consistent source of tension between the military and the civilian government. Most recently, Mr. Nobrega suspended inflation-linked pay increases for all state employees, including the military, and this has provoked acute anger among some sections of the armed forces. </TEXT></DOC>
