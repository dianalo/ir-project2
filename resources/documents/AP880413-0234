(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 19-year-old sailor accused ofkilling a shipmate's wife and child is incompetent to stand trialand meets the criteria for involuntary hospitalization, acourt-appointed psychiatrist said.   Walter T. Taylor has been suicidal since his arrest for thekillings, Dr. Ernest G. Miller said in a letter filed Tuesday withCircuit Judge R. Hudson Olliff.   Olliff will decide if Taylor is competent to stand trial. IfOlliff finds Taylor incompetent, the defendant will undergocounseling at a psychiatric center until he is competent.   Taylor is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in thekillings last August of Paula Smits and her 3-year-old daughter,Amanda. They died on Aug. 8 or 9, a few days after the USS Stark, aguided missile frigate, returned to Mayport Naval Air Station.   The defendant was a lookout aboard the Stark during the Iraqimissile attack that killed 37 of their shipmates last May 17 in thePersian Gulf. The victim's husband was aboard the USS Saratoga, anaircraft carrier.   Assistant public defenders Charles Cofer and Ann Finnell askedOlliff last week to order a psychiatric examination of theirclient, who is being held without bond in the Duval County Jail,because he was staring blankly and refusing to answer theirquestions.   Assistant State Attorney Cheryl Peek, who is prosecuting Taylor,said she will challenge the doctor's opinions during a competencyhearing scheduled for Friday.   Miller said Taylor is suffering from post-traumatic stresssyndrome, which has been found in Vietnam veterans and victims ofviolent crimes. The disorder was officially recognized by theAmerican Psychiatric Association in 1980.   Miller also said Taylor's father is serving a prison sentencefor murder.</TEXT></DOC>
