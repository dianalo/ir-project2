Stock funds, meanwhile, pulled in a robust $2.9 billionlast month, but some fund companies report slower sales inMay.</LP><TEXT>   Fueling the rush into bond funds is the disparity betweenmoney funds, which now yield less than 6%, and alternativessuch as government bond funds, where yields above 8% aren'tuncommon.   &quot;This is interest-rate shock,&quot; says Robert Leo, directorof mutual funds at Shearson Lehman Brothers. &quot;People aremoving out of CDs and money market funds, and into governmentbond funds and muni funds.&quot;   Last month's massive inflow into bond funds was well aheadof March's level, when bonds attracted $3.6 billion. April'sinflow was the highest level since March 1987, when bondfunds pulled in $9.9 billion during the euphoria thatpreceded the April 1987 bond market crash.   Cash inflow numbers are compiled by the Investment CompanyInstitute and cover new fund sales minus redemptions, plusthe net results of switches among funds in the same fundfamily. Reinvested dividends are excluded.   Fund company executives suspect that bond funds arepicking up assets at the expense of banks. And indeed, theInvestment Company Institute's numbers for April show that84% of the $6 billion going into bond funds came from newsales. The other 16% was picked up through exchanges fromother mutual funds, including money market funds.   Among different categories of bond funds, tax-freemunicipals were the big winner, pulling in $2.3 billionduring April. Funds that buy foreign bonds and funds thatinvest in Government National Mortgage Association bonds werealso popular.   The flood of money into GNMA funds is continuing duringMay, say fund companies. At Vanguard Group, for instance,half of the money going into the fund group's taxable bondfunds this month has ended up in the group's GNMA fund.That's got executives at the Valley Forge, Pa., fund groupworried.   &quot;The history of this industry is that, whenever you get ahuge capital flow into a fund, you should at least make surethat people know what they are buying,&quot; says John Bogle,Vanguard's chairman.   Mr. Bogle says Vanguard may write to shareholders of itsGNMA fund, explaining the risks involved in buying the fund.With a GNMA fund, he says, &quot;people have to know that they'retaking a price risk.&quot; If interest rates go up, GNMA issues --which are backed by pools of home mortgages -- suffer alongwith other bonds; if rates drop, there's a risk that a rushby homeowners to refinance mortgages will mean lower returnsthan investors had expected.   While most bond funds are pulling in heaps of money,interest in high-yielding junk-bond mutual funds is waning.During April, $312 million flowed into junk funds, comparedwith $493 million in March. And some fund groups even reportnet outflows from their junk-bond funds so far this month.   April's stock fund inflow of $2.9 billion was well aheadof March's $1.9 billion. But during April, interest in smallcompany stock funds dropped sharply, despite the stellarresults turned in by these funds so far this year. Lastmonth, just $444 million flowed into these so-calledaggressive growth funds, compared with $746 million in March.   Many fund groups say that the cash flows into stock fundsso far this month are flat or down compared with April. Butthere was one notable exception: Fidelity Investments, theU.S.'s largest manager of stock mutual funds, says cash ispouring into its stock funds at double April's pace.   If a survey conducted for Fidelity by the University ofMichigan Survey Research Center is any guide, then stockfunds will pick up more money in the months ahead. The surveyfound that, among mutual fund investors, the intention topurchase stock funds within the next three months is at 47%,up from 32% in April.   Stock mutual fund managers also seem to be gettingincreasingly bullish. In April, cash held by stock fundsdropped to 9.5% of stock fund assets. That's the lowest levelsince May 1989, and compares with 9.8% in March.   Falling fund cash levels is considered a bad sign for thestock market, because it means there's less money availableto invest in the market. Current cash levels aren't yet&quot;dangerously low,&quot; says A. Michael Lipper, president ofLipper Analytical Services, a mutual fund research firm.   But if cash levels get below 8%, he would start to worry.&quot;If it gets too low, it's probably a sign of the top of themarket,&quot; says Mr. Lipper.</TEXT></DOC>
