The maximum gain and efficiency are estimated at15.5 and 33%, respectively. The beam intensity is expected at -- 10/sup8/ for proton. The allocation of dipole magnets is determined on thebasis of the field measurement so as to suppress closed orbit distortion.The maximum closed orbit distortion is estimated at 9 mm owing to thefield error and the effective length error of dipole magnets. The stopband width of 3 {nu} = 5 excited by sextupole components of main magnetsis also estimated at 8 x 10/sup -4/ in the Cooler Ring MOde ({nu} x =1.75, {nu} y = 1.25).</TEXT></DOC>
