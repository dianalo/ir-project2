The policies of the big food retailers regarding bovine growth hormone, or BGH, became public yesterday as a coalition of 40 consumer, environmental and farm groups petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to halt the sale of dairy products containing BGH until the long-term health and economic effects of the hormone are fully studied.    The FDA hasn't yet approved BGH -- also known as bovine somatotropin -- for commercial use, but it has been allowing the sale of milk from BGH-treated herds on the ground that it doesn't pose a health hazard. One FDA official estimated the amount of BGH-tested milk on the market at less than 1% of the total supply.    The decision of the major chains to hold off to see whether the FDA gives its final approval, conceivably as early as January, was hailed as a breakthrough by the Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington-based group that opposes many applications of biotechnology. Jeremy Rifkin, president of the group, identified the chains as Safeway Stores Inc., Oakland, Calif.; Stop andamp; Shop Cos., Boston; Kroger Co., Cincinnati; Supermarkets General Corp., Woodbridge, N.J.; and Vons Cos., El Monte, Calif.    &quot;We aren't anti-BST {bovine somatotropin},&quot; said Jack Partridge, a Kroger spokesman. &quot;But if we're going to make any mistakes on this, we're going to make them on the side of safety.&quot;    A Safeway spokesman said that the chain requires assurances from its suppliers for Safeway's Lucerne brand that the milk is free of BGH. &quot;It was in 1986 that we first took this position,&quot; he said.    Tests show that BGH boosts milk production as much 25%, and many dairy groups fear widespread use of the hormone would cause a price-depressing glut of milk that would drive family farmers out of business. The groups also fear a consumer backlash at a time when so-called natural foods are in growing demand.    Four companies are working on versions of BGH -- Monsanto Co., American Cyanamid Co., Upjohn Co. and Eli Lilly Co. They have spent more than $100 million on research and development, each hopeful of capturing a large share of the $500 million-a-year market predicted for the growth hormone.    Opponents of BGH, in their petition to the FDA, cited scientific evidence that the hormone reduces the fertility of cows and increases their susceptibility to infectious diseases. They also said several questions about human health effects have yet to be answered.    In a position paper issued Aug. 4, the FDA said that BGH is safe in milk because it is a protein that breaks down into &quot;inactive fragments&quot; when consumed. BGH, the agency added, &quot;has always been present in milk . . . because it is produced naturally in the cows' pituitary.&quot;    The agency plans to publish early next year the research findings that will figure in whatever decision it makes on commercial marketing of BGH-treated milk. </TEXT></DOC>
