The offshore Sea Isle terminal, used for loading crude oil onto supertankers, was set on fire when it was hit by an Iranian missile. No ships were at the terminal, according to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report newswire accounts.    Oil prices, after an early rally, stabilized on indications the Kuwaitis would reactivate a floating buoy terminal about one mile south of Sea Isle to keep crude-oil supply commitments, analysts said.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude-oil contracts for December delivery rose 15 cents, to $20.20 a barrel. Petroleum-product prices posted modest gains.    On the spot, or noncontract, market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the bellwether U.S. crude, rose five cents, to $20.05 a barrel.    The restrained market move &quot;suggests that though there may be some near-term supply tightness, longer term there's nothing to worry about,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York.    Analysts said other factors kept a lid on a potential sharp rally. Reagan administration officials, who condemned the attack, said the U.S. wouldn't retaliate against Iran.    &quot;The measured response of the U.S. indicated that tensions wouldn't escalate further between the U.S. and Iran&quot; as a result of the incident, said Rick Donovan, head of the international energy department of E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., New York.    Four days ago, U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Persian Gulf, prompting Iran to vow for revenge. Relations between the two nations have been particularly tense since an Iranian missle struck a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker near the Sea Isle last Thursday.    Further stock market weakness also contributed to the muted oil-price action, some traders said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after rising two successive days following Monday's crash, fell broadly again yesterday.    &quot;There are still concerns that if economic growth slows, oil demand could dry up,&quot; said one trader at the Merc.    Some traders said liquidity and trading turnover could also be hampered by yesterday's announcement that Houston-based Enron Corp., the nation's largest pipeline operator, had discontinued its oil-trading unit in New York after unauthorized trading by certain former employees led to huge losses.    Enron's absence &quot;may make speculators in the market more nervous and have a temporary restraining effect on volume,&quot; said Michael Rothman, senior petroleum analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.    In other futures markets yesterday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle-future contracts plunged their daily permissible limit of 1.5 cents a pound on news of the stock market retreat. The move dashed the optimism of traders that cattle-futures prices were managing to separate themselves from swings in the financial-futures markets. &quot;Outside influences are still the main culprit,&quot; said Philip Stanley, a livestock analyst for Thomson McKinnon Securities. &quot;The charts are just a wreck.&quot; Yesterday's price drop brought the decline in most cattle contracts this week to about 4.5 cents a pound. That's the market's worst week since spring 1986, when the U.S. announced plans to pay diary operators to slaughter their herds, analysts said. Many traders moved out of the cattle market yesterday in anticipation of an Agriculture Department cattle-inventory report scheduled for release today. Although the report is expected to show a strong butcher rate, which would normally help boost nearby cattle futures, many traders don't want to take the chance of any surprises. &quot;There's a lot of confusion,&quot; said Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc., Chicago.    COPPER: The metal ran strong as tight supplies and strong demand continued. December delivery copper rose 1.90 cents a pound to 79.90 cents, 10 points shy of its high for the day. The rally was helped by a decline of 1,618 tons in Commodity Exchange copper warehouse stocks to 77,162 tons. The premium the December contract holds over more deferred positions increased yesterday by 15 points, indicating supplies are still tight. The same was true in London where the cash or nearby position's premium rose about 50% yesterday to the equivalent of about $135 per-metric-ton higher than the three-months position.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The price of many futures contracts dipped along with the stock market's slump. Some analysts, however, were encouraged by the relatively small size of the price drops. They said it was a sign of a growing attitude among traders that if a recession does emerge, it won't develop in time to depress prices for the periods covered by the nearby futures contracts. Futures contracts are also getting some support from rumors about the Soviet Union's interest in buying U.S. grain. &quot;We are still tied to the pyschology of the financial markets,&quot; said Jerry Gidel of G.H. Miller andamp; Co., Chicago. &quot;But I think we have a chance to pick up a little steam.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
