I fight to win,'' Mrs. Thatcher said as she lefther office at 10 Downing St. for the House of Commons, where asecond vote on the leadership of the ruling Conservative Party isscheduled for next week.   Mrs. Thatcher suffered a resounding defeat Tuesday when shefailed to stop a party leadership challenge by former defenseminister Michael Heseltine in the first round of voting amongConservative lawmakers.   The prime minister spent nearly 75 minutes in the House ofCommons, fielding questions after her brief report on the 34-nationsummit on European security, which she attended Monday and Tuesday.   When Paddy Ashdown, leader of the small Liberal DemocraticParty, suggested Mrs. Thatcher was ``in the twilight days of herpremiership,'' Mrs. Thatcher responded:   ``The first 11{ years haven't been so bad. With regard totwilight, please remember there are 24 hours in a day.''   Mrs. Thatcher also met today with Conservative leaders to assessher chances.   With Mrs. Thatcher weakened politically and her long-governingparty severely split, the opposition Labor Party - leading inopinion polls - is scenting victory.   ``I think people are far more likely to switch from her toMichael Heseltine than the other way around,'' said Conservativelawmaker Timothy Raison, who abstained on the first round.   Party leaders, including chairman Kenneth Baker and chief whipTimothy Renton, met with Mrs. Thatcher this afternoon. Renton, theparty's chief vote counter in Parliament, presumably gave Mrs.Thatcher his view on her support.   Lord Whitelaw, a former deputy prime minister and a seniorfigure in the party, also visited 10 Downing St. It was notimmediately known what they told her.   Mrs. Thatcher, Europe's longest-serving prime minister, felljust short of the 15 percent margin she needed to avoid a secondround of voting.   She received receiving 204 votes to 152 for Heseltine in thesecret ballot, with 16 lawmakers abstaining.   Conservative Party legislators, who hold 372 seats in the650-seat House of Commons, will vote for a second time nextTuesday, and Mrs. Thatcher would be expected to step down as primeminister if she does does not emerge victorious.   Rumors that Mrs. Thatcher would resign pushed up the Britishpound on currency exchanges late today, dealers said.   The Times of London today reported strong speculation amonglegislators that senior Tories would try to persuade thestrong-willed Mrs. Thatcher to reverse her decision to fight asecond round.   Mrs. Thatcher, who was in Paris for the 34-nation summit onEuropean security, is expected on Thursday to lead the debate onthe motion of no confidence proposed by opposition Labor Partyleader Neil Kinnock.   Heseltine could win the leadership by picking up the 16 votesthat abstained on Tuesday and persuading 19 of Mrs. Thatcher'ssupporters to change sides.   Other candidates have until noon Thursday to join the race.   In the second round, a simple majority can win, but othercandidates now are free to join the race. If necessary, a third andfinal ballot would be held Nov. 29.   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, has recently suffered a great loss inpopularity, in part because of a new per capita local services taxthat demands the same fee of prince and pauper alike.   Her government also has been blamed for high inflation and highinterest rates. The Conservatives have trailed Labor in opinionpolls for 16 months.   Heseltine, 57, also has criticized Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance tofully integrate Britain into the European Community.   She became prime minister when the Conservatives won the 1979general election and is now in her third term.   The next general election must be held by mid-1992 at the latestbut the prime minister of the day can call one any time beforethen.   If he becomes prime minister, Heseltine has pledged tosubstitute what he calls ``caring capitalism'' for Mrs. Thatcher'saustere free market policies.   In addition, he has focused on her lone opposition amongEuropean Common Market leaders to closer political and financialunity in the Community.   Heseltine has also promised to review the new per capita tax,which sparked anti-Tory riots in London and elsewhere this year.   Heseltine resigned as defense secretary in 1986 in a fight overrival merits of European and U.S. rescue packages for the Westlandhelicopter company.</TEXT></DOC>
