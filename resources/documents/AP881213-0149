The bones were discovered near the site of the old Jewish Ghettoin Warsaw last summer during a construction project which since hasbeen abandoned.   Historians determined that the site was a mass grave used by theNazis for Polish Jews who were shot or died of starvation in theghetto. Some non-Jewish Poles also were believed to be buried there.   In the ceremony carried out during a light snowfall, about 100wooden boxes of remains were carried by several dozen people from atemporary storage area to a specially build crypt at the site.   The rabbis removed the bones from the boxes, wrapped them inwhite cloths and lowered them into pre-formed concrete cubicles. Theentire site is to become a monument to the victims of genocide.   The ceremony, attended by Warsaw Mayor Jerzy Boleslawski andother dignitarites, was organized by the Polish VeteransOrganization and by the Nissenbaum Foundation, which restores andpreserves Jewish monuments in Poland.   ``We want to express our appreciation to the Polish governmentfor its courageous stand in preserving this entire area,'' saidRabbi Hertz Frankel of New York, speaking at the ceremony.   ``We participate in sorrow and mourning of our elder brothers,who gave us the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill,''' said BishopHenryk Muszczynski of Warsaw, who also took part in the prayers ofmourning led by the rabbis.   Before World War II, Poland was home to 3.5 million Jews. About 3million were slaughtered by the Nazis. Most of the rest left Polandafter the war, and today the Jewish population is estimated at about10,000.</TEXT></DOC>
