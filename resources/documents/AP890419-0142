He just wants to go home.''   In an emotional closing argument, Brendan Sullivan said Northbecame a ``sacrificial lamb'' in the Reagan White House and wasfired to spare the former president political harm.   ``Now he cries out,'' Sullivan said as the 12-week Iran-Contratrial wound toward its conclusion a few blocks from the White Housewhere North once worked. ``In a sense he has been a hostage. I askyou on the evidence to set him free.''   In his hour-long rebuttal, prosecutor John Keker put downSullivan's closing argument with the Shakespearian line: ``It wasall sound and fury, signifying nothing.''   ``You have heard a lot about courage at this trial,'' saidKeker. ``There's another kind of courage: courage to admit when youare wrong; courage to admit personal responsibility, courage toadmit guilt where appropriate. He (North) has not admitted any ofthose things; it's time for you to do it for him.''   North, a former Marine, is charged with 12 criminal counts oflying to Congress and the attorney general, illegally convertingtravelers checks to his own use and conspiracy to defraud theTreasury through a tax scam to support the Contra rebels fightingthe leftist Nicaraguan government.   If convicted, he could receive prison terms totaling 60 yearsand fines of $3 million.   Prosecutor John Keker was permitted time to address the jury afinal time after Sullivan concluded. Judge Gerhard Gesell isexpected to give the case to the jury on Thursday.   Sullivan, who has North's defense lawyer through tumultuouscongressional hearings and tedious courtoom maneuvering, seemed togrow emotional as he summed up the defense for the last time.   ``Greater love has no man than he be willing to lay down hislife for another,'' the lawyer read from a Bible in his hand.   ``That's the kind of man Ollie North is,'' said Sullivan. ``Nowhe cries out. In a sense he has been a hostage. I ask you on theevidence to set him free.''   ``Ollie North doesn't want to be a hero,'' the attorneydeclared. ``He just wants to go home.''   Sullivan described the Reagan administration and the Iran-Contraaffair this way:   ``It's like a big octopus. The president, McFarlane, Poindexter,Casey ... they are all reaching out to get Ollie North to runsomething. ... They are all reaching out to get him.''   Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter were national securityadvisers to President Reagan, and the late William Casey was CIAdirector.   Earlier, Sullivan said it was ``natural instinct'' for North todestroy documents because he was engaged in some of thegovernment's most secret operations.   ``It's a reasonable thing to do,'' Sullivan said of North'sdecision to destroy records as he prepared to leave the NationalSecurity Council staff in November 1986. ``The act of destroyingdocuments'' would be the ``natural instinct of anybody running acovert operation.''   ``Colonel North had charge of running some of the most secretoperations'' in the government, Sullivan said as North'sIran-Contra trial approached its end.   The former NSC aide is accused of altering, destroying,concealing and removing documents as the Iran-Contra affair emergedpublicly in November 1986.   North testified that among the documents he destroyed were memosreflecting the diversion of funds from the sale of weapons to Iranto the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. One memo reflecting a planneddiversion that North neglected to shred was found in his files onNov. 22, 1986 by an aide to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.   Elsewhere in his closing arguments, Sullivan said highlysensitive information distributed to CIA Director Casey andnational security adviser Poindexter in November 1985 showed thatHawk missiles were aboard a flight to Iran.   Sullivan referred to the foreign intelligence data to bolsterhis defense against charges that North prepared a false chronologyof events that prompted Casey and Poindexter to mislead Congress inNovember 1986.   North is accused of preparing documents stating that no one inthe U.S. government knew until January 1986 that Hawks were aboardan aircraft to Iran on the November 1985 flight assisted by theCIA. A CIA proprietary airline carried the shipment.   Sullivan held up a notebook stuffed with 417 pages of 168top-secret intercepted messages that pertained to the Hawk shipment.   The intelligence data was distributed immediately to Casey andPoindexter hours after it was gathered, he said.   Any accusation ``based on the charge that Ollie North was therepository of special information is wrong, false, inaccurate,misleading and unfair,'' Sullivan argued.   Referring to Casey as ``the master spy,'' he said: ``Is anybodyto believe he didn't know what was in the intercept book?''   Sullivan said the material is so sensitive that the jurors won'tbe permitted to see it. He held up a brief summary of theinformation culled from the intercepts.   When Casey testified to Congress on Nov. 21, 1986, he gave noindication that the CIA and National Security Council staff knewthe November 1985 shipment contained arms. Poindexter testifiedthat the U.S. government didn't learn until January 1986 thatIsrael had transferred 18 Hawk missiles to Iran.   The November 1985 Hawk shipment was of questionable legality. Itwas been retroactively legalized by a ``finding'' that PresidentReagan signed in December 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
