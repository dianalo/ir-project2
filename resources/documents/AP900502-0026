(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Sancilio's little sisterrepresents the 4-year-old boy's best, and perhaps only, hope forlife.   Doctors on Tuesday drew blood from the girl's umbilical cordduring birth in hopes of using it to save her leukemia-strickenbrother.   The blood was rushed to Indiana University to see if it matchesMichael's. If so, scientists will try for the first time to use theunique cells of umbilical cord blood to grow healthy bone marrow ina leukemia patient.   It will be several days before doctors know if there is a match,the chances of which were rated by doctors at 1-in-4.   In March, Michael was diagnosed with chronic myelogenousleukemia, a rare, incurable form of the disease that strikes fewerthan 1 percent of childhood leukemia victims, said Dr. StephenRodgers, the family's pediatrician. Children with the diseasegenerally survive less than a year after diagnosis, he said.   Leukemia patients normally are treated with bone marrowtransplants. But because time is short and the chances of finding acompatible donor are 1-in-20,000, doctors are attempting the newtreatment.   On Tuesday, doctors at Virginia Beach General Hospital took thefirst step in delivering Christina Grace Sancilio by Caesareansection. They clamped off the umbilical cord and removed about acup of umbilical cord blood.   Rodgers said umbilical blood contains special cells called stemcells that develop bone marrow in babies in their first nine months.   If Christina's blood matches Michael's, the cells will be grownat the university, which pioneered the procedure for the treatmentof some forms of anemia. Once scientists have grown a sheet of thecells, they will inject them into Michael's heart after hisdiseased bone marrow has been killed by radiation.   The new cells, in theory, will act as they do in a newborn,heading straight for the bone to produce bone marrow.   With sons Michael and Tony in his arms, Anthony Sancilio, 35,tried to express his joy and hope at seeing his daughter. ``I'mspeechless,'' he said. ``I'm thankful the baby is healthy andhopeful that we will have a match.''   Tests on 7-year-old Tony showed he was not a compatible donorfor his brother.   Dr. Leslie L. Wasserman, who delivered both Christina andMichael, said the collection of blood went smoothly, though thesurgical team had to make sure none of the mother's blood was mixedwith the umbilical cord blood.   Wasserman said a Caesarean section was undertaken because of33-year-old Denise Sancilio's difficulties in delivering Michael.He said mother and baby are doing fine.   The procedure has been done twice before to treat forms ofanemia. Because it has never been tried on a leukemia patient,doctors are unsure what to expect.   ``This is most likely his only chance,'' Rodgers said. ``It'sall going to take several months, and Michael will be close to theend of his disease when we try the transfusion.''   Even if the procedure is successful, Rodgers said, the childfaces a lifetime of treatment to ensure the body does not rejectthe new bone marrow.</TEXT></DOC>
