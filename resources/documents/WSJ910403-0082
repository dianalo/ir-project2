In a lengthy motion to a federal district court inPhoenix, Ariz., the RTC, the government agency created toclear up the thrift mess, said it will seek damages of morethan $50 million against the firm. The Cleveland law firmdeclined to comment on the charges, which arose from thegovernment's continuing investigations of the costly collapseof the savings-and-loan operations built by Charles Keating.</LP><TEXT>   An important part of the government's case involvescharges that lawyers, accountants and other professionalsaided and abetted Lincoln's problems by helping to conceal orcondone illegal activity. Lawyers working on the government'scase said that charges could be filed against several othermajor law and accounting firms.   Lawyers representing the government currently are holdingdiscussions with the Chicago law firm Sidley and Austin; theNew York law firm Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays and Handler; andthe accounting firms of Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. and Ernst andamp;Young.   According to lawyers for the government, the discussionscould lead to settlements, formal government charges ofwrongdoing, or a decision to drop proceedings against thefirms. RTC Chairman William Seidman said in February that asettlement with Ernst andamp; Young, whose predecessor firm didwork for Lincoln, is &quot;in the mill.&quot; The Phoenix firm ofMorrison, Hecker, Curtis, Kuder andamp; Parrish is representing theRTC in the Lincoln case.   The charges against Jones Day emerged in a governmentmotion asking the court's permission to make the prestigiousfirm a defendant in the civil case against Mr. Keating andhis associates. In the same motion, the RTC asked the courtto make First Bank National Association of Minneapolis andthe Phoenix law firm of Mariscal, Weeks, McIntyre andamp;Friedlander defendants.   In its suit, the government charged Mr. Keating and otherswith looting Lincoln for their own benefit. The complaintsaid that they &quot;required the cooperation, acquiescence andassistance of various professionals in order to successfullyimplement their scheme to defraud Lincoln and the regulatoryauthorities.&quot;   The RTC charged that First Bank National, formerly FirstNational Bank of Minneapolis, violated its fiduciaryresponsibility as the trustee of an Employee Stock Ownershipplan to which insiders at Lincoln and its parent, AmericanContinental Corp. of Phoenix, allegedly sold stock atinflated prices. Officials at the bank, a unit of First BankSystem Inc., couldn't be reached for comment. The RTC chargedMariscal Weeks with legal malpractice. An official of thefirm said he had no comment.   Details of the charges against Jones Day are contained ina 20-page section of the lengthy motion. The RTC assertedthat in 1985, Jones Day set out &quot;to market to thrifts anexpertise in the regulatory affairs of savings and loanassociations&quot; and was hired by Lincoln in 1986 to conduct anaudit of the thrift's regulatory compliance.   Instead, the firm helped the thrift &quot;in concealing vitalinformation from {federal} examiners and manufacturingdocuments for files, it helped {Lincoln} createafter-the-fact ratifications for transactions notappropriately authorized by the Lincoln Board, it allowedforgeries of minutes and resolutions to continue, and it madematerial misrepresentations&quot; to government regulators, theRTC charged.   The government's motion focused on the role of WilliamSchilling, a former thrift regulator who joined Jones Day.Although Mr. Schilling had criticized Lincoln's operatingmethods when he was with the government, he joined the JonesDay team working on Lincoln. The law firm then aidedLincoln's &quot;scheme to mislead the regulators and impede theperformance of the regulators' duty to protect Lincoln andultimately protect the federal deposit insurance fund&quot; fromlosses that could exceed $2 billion, the RTC said.   Mr. Schilling couldn't be reached for comment.   Separately, Lee Henkel, another former thrift regulator,could be made part of the case because of past dealings withLincoln, lawyers said. He is one of several people with whomthe government's lawyers have been holding discussions. Mr.Henkel, an Atlanta lawyer, was traveling in Europe andcouldn't be reached for comment.   Lincoln, which was based in Irvine, Calif., was seized bythe federal government in 1989, and its branches and depositswere sold last month to a unit of Great Western FinancialCorp., Beverly Hills, Calif. Meanwhile, people close to theSecurities and Exchange Commission have said that the agencyhas authorized fraud charges against American Continental,which has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.   Several federal and state government agencies areinvestigating or have charged Mr. Keating, who was chairmanof American Continental, in connection with alleged fraud andviolations of securities laws.</TEXT></DOC>
