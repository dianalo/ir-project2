PATRAN is a powerful program which greatlysimplifies the tasks of generating two- or three-dimensional geometrymodels, creating finite element grids, and applying boundary conditions.In order to use a model created in PATRAN in any analysis program, atranslator must be written to convert the model from the PATRAN neutralfile format into an input format specific to the analysis program. TRANSLis a versatile FORTRAN-77 subroutine library implemented on VAX computerswhich performs activities common to any interactive PATRAN translator.Its capabilities include reading specified PATRAN neutral file data intomemory, sorting neutral file data and general arrays, searching for aspecific piece of information, communicating with the user, and filehandling. A session file for automatic submission of input in a latertranslator session and a print file containing all communication withthe user may be automatically generated. The driver for the TRANSL subroutinelibrary is a program which reads all data from the neutral file intomemory and writes it out again in the same format. This program demonstratesthe use of TRANSL subroutines for developing a PATRAN translator andprovides a means for testing the TRANSL subroutines. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
