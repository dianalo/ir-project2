Incrustations mustbe evaluated from the initial phase of the project. This is during theexploration stage when representative reservoir fluid is available forthe purpose of determining: (1) the feasibility of the project, (2) theappropriate process, and (3) maintenance programs. Evaluation of incrustationsimplies the following activities: (1) complete characterization of thegeothermal fluid, (2) characterization of the incrustations, (3) characterizationof the reservoir, (4) determination of the rate of incrustation, and(5) evaluation of methods of control. The prediction of rates of incrustationformation is one of the most useful tools for selecting the process fora geothermoelectric plant. Nevertheless, little progress has been madein this area. Several general recommendations are included for engineersand scientists who design and operate geothermoelectric plants, as wellas some methods of incrustation control.</TEXT></DOC>
