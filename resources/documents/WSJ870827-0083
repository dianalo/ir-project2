Cyril Ramaphosa, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, said the rejection was virtually unanimous and that &quot;the strike continues until our demands are met.&quot; He said the union transmitted a telex message to the Chamber of Mines, which represents the country's six largest mining houses, &quot;to inform them that our entire membership on the striking mines has decided not to accept the chamber's offer.&quot;    There was no indication yesterday of when talks might resume between the mine owners and the union. Mr. Ramaphosa said the union remains willing &quot;at any time to resume negotiations&quot; and again urged that the dispute be referred to mediation, an idea the mineowners rejected when negotiations broke down in mid-July. James Motlatsi, president of the NUM, said, &quot;The ball is in the chamber's court.&quot;    Johann Liebenberg, leader of the employers' negotiating team, said that &quot;our managements will simply have to do whatever is necessary to bring it {the strike} to an end as quickly as possible. We think this is a sad miscalculation on the part of the union.&quot; The owners weren't specific about what they would do to end the walkout, but several already have begun dismissing strikers and threatening thousands of others with the same fate.    Meanwhile, Mr. Ramaphosa said the country's biggest labor federation, the 700,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions, was discussing possible sympathy strikes. He gave no details.    Disagreement on wages continues to block any settlement of the miners' strike, which began Aug. 9. The miners have shown some willingness to compromise on this issue, but the mine owners have yet to budge from their original position.    The NUM had been demanding a 30% across-the-board wage increase, as opposed to pay raises ranging up to 23% that were unilaterally implemented by the mine owners in July. However, Mr. Ramaphosa said union negotiators lowered their wage demand at talks on Tuesday to a 27% increase, &quot;with a view to inducing an offer from the chamber.&quot;    The mine owners had refused to discuss wages but then apparently dropped that position, opening the way to a resumption of negotiations. But Mr. Ramaphosa said wages were not discussed at Tuesday's bargaining session, the first since the strike began, and the mine owners at that meeting offered only an improvement in some other benefits.    Before the result of yesterday's membership vote was announced, NUM spokesman Kuben Pillay said the union leadership was split on whether to accept the offer. &quot;Some of us feel it would be strategic to accept the offer and others feel we must continue with the strike,&quot; Mr. Pillay said. The voting settled that question.    With yesterday's rejection of the owners' offer, striking miners continue to face the threat of mass firings. About 11,000 miners had been dismissed before negotiations resumed on Tuesday, and many thousands more face various deadlines to return to work or face dismissal.    Anglo American Corp., the country's largest mining house, said after the voting results were announced that it will concentrate on returning its mines to full production, indicating it may go ahead with firings of striking workers.    South African labor law allows blacks to strike legally but offers them no formal protection against punitive dismissal. Nonetheless, union leaders have said they would challenge any dismissals.    The union says 340,000 miners are on strike at 45 gold and coal mines. The mine owners, who claim that several thousand miners have returned to work, estimate the number of strikers at 210,000 at 29 mines. </TEXT></DOC>
