RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Activists planning a state-by-state legislativecampaign for abortion rights say they have little hope that a deeplydivided Supreme Court will protect their interests.   ``We will do everything we can to make this the issue of thecoming elections,'' said Molly Yard, president of the NationalOrganization for Women. ``We will seek to build a political army allacross the country.''   The aim, she said Tuesday, is to convince legislators they willpay a heavy price for supporting anti-abortion laws.   The high court's willingness to scrap the constitutional right toabortion it established 16 years ago appears now to hingeprecariously on the vote of Sandra Day O'Connor, the only woman inthe nation's history to serve as a Supreme Court justice.   Abortion rights groups say they have little reason to hope shewill vote to bar states from enacting tougher and tougher laws tolimit abortions.   ``She never met a regulation she doesn't like,'' said SarahWeddington, the lawyer who successfully argued the 1973 case of Roevs. Wade that legalized abortion.   ``We can't look to the courts for our protection on this anymore,'' said Patricia Ireland of the National Organization for Women.   Those assessments were prompted by the high court's ruling Mondaythat barely stopped short of letting states outlaw abortions.   In a series of 5-4 votes, the justices ended their 1988-89 termby removing some of the shackles that barred states from regulatingmost abortions for 16 years. In its next term beginning in October,the court could give states even broader power.   The court agreed to study three new abortion disputes, giving ita new opportunity to overturn Roe vs. Wade in 1990.   ``There is no longer a majority on the court to support Roe,''said Janet Benshoof of the American Civil Liberties Union.   Abortion opponents happily agreed.   ``Roe's days are numbered,'' said Randall Terry of OperationRescue.   O'Connor is one of five justices who have expressed hostility tothe 1973 ruling. In 1983 she said its central premise _ permittinggreater state control as a woman's pregnancy proceeds _ has ``nojustification in the law or logic.''   But if the 16-year-old structure is tottering, O'Connor has notyet announced a willingness to topple it.   The time is not ripe to discard it, she said, choosing instead touphold Missouri regulations limiting abortion rights on narrowergrounds.   She voted, for example, to let states require various medicaltests to determine whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is``viable'' or capable of surviving outside the womb.   The court's 1973 ruling allowed states to make it a crime toabort a viable fetus _ but the justices then drew the viability lineat 24 weeks.   The tests ordered by Missouri ``are to be performed whenviability is possible,'' O'Connor said.   That could add $150 or more to the cost of an abortion. But,O'Connor said, that ``does not impose an undue burden on a woman'sabortion decision.''   Justice Antonin Scalia's separate concurring opinion expressedfrustration with the caution of his fellow conservatives on thecourt.   ``It thus appears that the mansion of constitutionalized abortionlaw, constructed overnight in Roe vs. Wade, must be disassembleddoorjamb by doorjamb and never entirely brought down, no matter howwrong it may be,'' Scalia wrote.   Others on the court surely ready to dismantle the 16-year-oldruling are Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R.White and Anthony M. Kennedy.   The addition of Kennedy to the court last year has shifted thebalance of power on abortion and other issues as well.   Kennedy, O'Connor and Scalia are appointees of former PresidentReagan, who also elevated Rehnquist to chief justice to lead theswing to conservatism. White, named by former President Kennedy,votes with them on many key cases.</TEXT></DOC>
