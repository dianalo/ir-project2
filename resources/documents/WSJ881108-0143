The Nasdaq Composite Index of 4,600 OTC stocks slipped 4.51 to 376.51, a slightly sharper percentage decline than that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Decliners, including such active stocks as MCI Communications, Apple Computer and Nike, held a big 1,504-to-575 lead over advancers.    The composite's 4.51-point decline was its biggest since Aug. 15. And while the index is up about 14% for the year, it made all that gain by early March; the advances since then have been wiped out.    &quot;The problem is small investors aren't doing a lot,&quot; said John W. Bachmann, managing principal at Edward D. Jones andamp; Co. in St. Louis. The 1,300-office brokerage chain caters to individual investors, mostly in the Midwest.    The recent big takeover transactions involving a select few New York Stock Exchange issues haven't helped small investors regain interest in the OTC market, Mr. Bachmann said. &quot;Small investors are seeing things that are puzzling to them,&quot; he said. &quot;They see transactions such as Philip Morris/Kraft, with the incredible obscene fees to a few top executives and others who are involved, and that doesn't do much to instill (investors') confidence.&quot;    For several months, Mr. Bachmann said, investors have wanted to get past the Oct. 19 anniversary of the stock crash and today's election. Now that both milestones are safely behind, the OTC market might anticipate its usual January buying spurt, he and other traders said.    It didn't take much for traders to sell off OTC issues.    American Travellers, for example, plunged 1 5/8 to 4 5/8 -- a 26% fall to lead the decliners list after an analyst reiterated his long-term bullish view on the stock but cut his earnings estimates for this year and next. American Travellers, based in Warrington, Pa., is a supplemental-health insurer with a market value of about $15 million.    The analyst, Tom Richter of Robinson Humphrey Co., Atlanta, said he dropped his 1989 estimate from $1.30 a share to $1.10, and his estimate for this year from $1.05 a share to 95 cents. The company earned $1.02 a share in 1987. Mr. Richter cited concern over current price competition from Pioneer Financial Services and others. Pioneer closed unchanged at 11 1/4.    But even Mr. Richter said he was &quot;shocked&quot; at the size of American Travellers' tumble. Though some investors were nervous about the stock anyway, the 26% plunge showed how &quot;thin and skittish&quot; the market is, he said.    Among other decliners, Braintree Savings Bank fell 1 to 15 3/4 after rising 1 on Friday. The Braintree, Mass., bank said it terminated talks about a possible merger. It didn't say with whom it was talking.    Pantera's fell 3/8 to 5. The restaurant chain reported first-quarter net income of one cent a share, compared with a year-earlier loss, and said it filed for a proposed public offering of 1.1 million common shares.    Some other major restaurant issues showed modest advances, including Bob Evans Farms, up 1/8 to 16 3/8, and Sizzler Restaurants International, up 1/4 to 17 3/4. But Chili's fell 1/4 to 26 3/8 and Dunkin' Donuts declined 1/2 to 25 1/2. </TEXT></DOC>
