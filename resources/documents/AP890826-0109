Actor-filmmaker Robert Redford, who co-sponsored the four-dayconference with the Soviet Academy of Science, read a letter toPresident Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev:   ``The United States of America and the U.S.S.R. are the twolargest producers of greenhouse gases'' thought to cause globalwarming, Redford said.   ``We should provide the leadership in the search for commonsolutions to the global warming problem as well as for theenvironmental security of the world.''   The letter was signed by Redford and space researcher RoaldSegdeev, head of an 11-member Soviet delegation, who said the twonations must cooperate to undo the environmental damage they haveincurred.   ``For the crimes we've committed, as humans on the planet, we aresentenced to do this job. And I think it is a life-long sentence,''Segdeev said.   His comments ended the conference of Soviet and Americanscientists, political leaders, environmentalists, filmmakers andauthors. Among those attending were Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., andTim Wirth, D-Colo.; Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus; astronomer Carl Sagan,former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall; and cartoonist GarryTrudeau.   The attempt at ``greenhouse glasnost'' was not as much ascientific conference as it was an attempt to ``pass the baton''from scientists to policy-shapers in both countries, who need totake action, Redford said.   During the conference, scientists predicted that the greenhouseeffect, caused by rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide andother gases produced by industrial societies, could raise globaltemperatures by 2 to 10 degrees over the next century. That couldalter worldwide weather patterns and cause the melting of the polarice caps, flooding coastal regions.   To combat the rise of carbon dioxide, much of which comes fromthe burning of fossil fuels, the letter proposes the two superpowersform an ``environmental security alliance'' to:   _Promote energy-efficient technology.   _Halt production and use by the year 2000 of chlorofluorocarbons,another group of greenhouse gases, and ``substantially reduce''carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.   _Reduce the rate of worldwide deforestation and start theplanting of trees in unforested areas.   The letter was accompanied by a conference report detailingspecific strategies for reducing global warming.   In the past, Redford's Institute For Resource Management, aprivate environmental mediation group based at his Sundance resortin central Utah, has tackled offshore drilling in the Bering Sea,the construction of power plants in the Southwest and air qualityissues.</TEXT></DOC>
