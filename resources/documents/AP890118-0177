(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Sleeman, the kingpin in what isconsidered the most widespread case of public corruption in Vermonthistory, was sentenced Wednesday to a minimum of two years in jail.   Judge Francis McCaffrey sentenced the former Bennington schoolsuperintendent to jail terms of three to seven years on each count,the terms to be served concurrently, with a minimum of two yearsbehind bars.   Sleeman, 58, was convicted last fall of eight counts ofembezzlement and one count of false swearing, all stemming fromallegations he used school money for personal uses.   McCaffrey ordered Sleeman to make $8,425 in restitution and toperform 1,000 hours of community service.   Prosecutors had urged McCaffrey to give Sleeman five to 10 yearsin jail, while Sleeman's lawyer argued for no jail term, saying hisclient had suffered enough.   Sleeman was convicted of embezzling $4,285 in rent checks fromtwo school bank accounts for building space he leased, and of lyingabout the rent checks during a February 1986 inquest into theBennington school scandal.   His conviction came in the first of four trials he faces on aseries of charges that were prompted by the discovery in 1984 of a$2 million deficit in the Bennington School District.   In all, Sleeman is charged with embezzling $20,000 and a car. Hehas yet to be tried on 21 embezzlement counts and three counts offalse swearing stemming from state inquests in which he allegedlylied about his use of school funds.   Four former top-ranking school officials have been punished fortheir part in the scandal, though none has received jail time.</TEXT></DOC>
