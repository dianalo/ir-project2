The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, supported by othergroups, sent EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas a letter saying theSuperfund study plan ``usurps the legislative function and is aclear attempt to shift blame for the agency's sorry record.''   EPA plans to give $2.5 million to the Conservation Foundationfor a major study of the law under the direction of a steeringcommittee made up of 20 people from industry, the states and fourenvironmental groups. The law comes up for revision in 1991.   The steering committee ``includes representatives of industriesthat want to repeal the cornerstone of the law, the strict jointand several liability standard,'' said Bill Walsh of the publicinterest group, an advocacy organization that Ralph Nader helpedfound.   ``Taxpayers should not be forced to finance an industry effortto cripple the Superfund law,'' Walsh said.   ``Joint and several'' liability means that any company found tohave contributed to dumping, no matter how small the amount, couldbe held responsible for the entire cleanup cost. EPA has oftencalled the provision an indispensable tool in its enforcementefforts.   The four groups asked to take part were the EnvironmentalDefense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the SierraClub and the National Audubon Society. The fund said it had notdecided whether to participate, key officials at the council andthe society were away from their offices and the club said it didnot expect to participate.   Sierra Club lobbyist Blake Early said the club would like tohave the study ``redirected to focus on the problems EPA has had inimplementing the law and not whether Congress did the right thing.''   Linda Fisher, assistant EPA administrator for policy, planningand evaluation, said: ``No one in this agency would ever give upjoint and several liability. It goes to the core not only ofSuperfund, but hazardous waste management in general.''   She said the Superfund study will examine ``how it's beingimplemented, how you can increase state cleanups and how you canincrease private party cleanups.''   Joining Walsh's group in the request to Thomas were the CleanWater Action Project, Citizen Action, Environmental Action, theEnvironmental Policy Institute, Friends of the Earth, GreenpeaceUSA, the National Toxics Campaign, Maine Peoples Alliance, the NewJersey Environmental Federation, the Ohio Public Interest Campaign,OMB Watch, Public Citizen, the Rainbow Lobby and the Silicon ValleyToxics Campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
