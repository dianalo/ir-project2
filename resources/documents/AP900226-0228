Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank in New York quoted abid for gold at $408.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $7 fromFriday's late bid.   Another sharp decline in the Tokyo stock market overnight helpedthe dollar because the decline reduced chances that Japaneseauthorities would raise interest rates there, analysts said.   ``They can't raise interest rates because that would send theirstock and real estate markets into a tailspin,'' said JerryRothman, a currency broker for Elders Futures Inc.   He said the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve Board eachintervened in the currency markets during the trading day in aneffort to curb the dollar's rise and stop the yen's fall.   But Rothman and other dealers said the dollar sales by thecentral banks failed to drive the dollar lower.   ``This is the highest dollar level against the yen since lastJune,'' Rothman said. ``But there is little they can do about itshort of raising interest rates.''   Karen Gibbs, a senior vice president in financial futures atDean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago, said the dollar alsobenefited from its traditional role as a safe haven because of thefinancial uncertainty in Japan.
