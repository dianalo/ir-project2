But the company still believes it can deliver a fullsystem to the laboratory on time, Neil Davenport, presidentand chief executive, said.</LP><TEXT>   The Cray-3 is the brainchild of Seymour Cray, founder ofCray Research Inc. Mr. Cray spun off Cray Computer from CrayResearch to develop the machine, which uses gallium arsenidecircuits instead of silicon.   Mr. Davenport said the problems that caused the company tomiss a Dec. 9 demonstration date with the laboratory don'tinvolve the exotic technology. He said it isn't possible toaccurately assess the delay but said &quot;it appears that thereare no major obstacles preventing the demonstration of aworking machine in the coming months.&quot;   By missing the demonstration date, the company gaveLawrence Livermore an option to cancel its order, butsupercomputer experts say that is unlikely.   The lab plans to use the $30 million machine as the&quot;principal workhorse computer&quot; for the National EnergyResearch Supercomputer Center that the lab operates for theEnergy Department. About 4,000 researchers use the center forstudies on magnetic fusion, global warming and otherenergy-related topics, the spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
