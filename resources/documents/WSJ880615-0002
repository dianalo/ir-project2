Major tobacco companies aren't expected to make major business changes in the wake of the Cipollone verdict, because there is little incentive. Despite their diversification efforts of recent years, they are as addicted to cigarettes' cash flow as smokers are, allegedly, to nicotine.    &quot;(The Cipolone verdict) is a non-event for their businesses,&quot; said Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. analyst Roy D. Burry. &quot;Unless you get a massive settlement, it just doesn't affect demand for their product or pricing of it.&quot;    And it certainly doesn't affect profit margins, which are among the most lush in U.S. industry. Mr. Burry estimates operating margins for domestic tobacco businesses at 36% for Philip Morris Cos., 35% for RJR Nabisco and 31% for American Brands Inc., three of the nation's four biggest tobacco concerns.    Indeed, in a business sense, cigarette-makers seem nearly invulnerable to the slings and arrows of anti-smoking groups. If all cigarette advertising were banned, as some would like, the profit margins would just get wider. If excise taxes are increased, the dent in consumption is just temporary. After all, the cigarette makers raise prices semi-annually, like clockwork, and it only fattens profits without hastening sales declines.    And tobacco stocks looked far less vulnerable than might have been expected yesterday, registering only modest declines in reaction to the Cipollone verdict, which found Liggett Group Inc. liable for $400,000 in damages.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Liggett Group shares closed at $7.625, off 50 cents; Philip Morris shares finished at $83.25, off $1.75; RJR at $47, off $1; Loews Corp. shares fell 25 cents to $65.125; and American Brands stock rose 25 cents, to $45.125.    Certainly, this is an at-best mature industry. Annual unit volumes of cigarettes sold have been declining at a steady rate of about 2% a year. But the tobacco companies are playing a sophisticated end-game, in which the cash they reap is invested in their non-tobacco businesses. A $4 billion capital improvements program for RJR Nabisco's food businesses, for instance, is being largely funded with tobacco cash. Cash is also put toward acquiring still more non-tobacco businesses, such as the recent purchase by American Brands of some office products and home and hardware businesses from E-II Holdings Inc.    But even as tobacco companies assemble many non-tobacco businesses, cigarettes remain king-sized profit centers. At Philip Morris, tobacco accounted for only 53% of the company's sales last year but about 80% of operating profit. American Brands' domestic tobacco business accounted for only 15% of total sales but 40% of operating profit. Loews' Lorillard Inc. unit contributed 18% of revenue but 35% of all profit. RJR's tobacco business accounted for 40% of sales but 67% of profit.    One reason this is so lucrative: the major cigarette-makers have slashed their manufacturing costs with highly automated plants. Another is that they are turning increasingly to international markets, where smoking often doesn't have such a bad rap as a health hazard and where previously untapped markets, like Japan, are opening up. While RJR's domestic cigarette volume declined 1.6% last year, its international sales jumped more than 10%.    Those kinds of contributions weigh heavily against companies now trying to distance themselves from tobacco or even to divest. RJR considered making a master limited partnership out of its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. last year but ultimately decided against it for reasons that remain relevant today.    &quot;Given the value the tobacco company has and the complexity of something like that, it didn't look like it would benefit the company,&quot; an RJR spokeswoman said.    Indeed, some analysts say that, far from reorganizing their structures post-Cipollone, most tobacco companies would be ready to invest in themselves as they are. &quot;I think they will be more inclined to share repurchase programs,&quot; said Diana K. Temple of Salomon Brothers Inc., noting that this would help support their sagging stocks and would follow a recent pattern. RJR recently bought back about 21 million of its shares in a &quot;Dutch auction&quot; and now is in the process of repurchasing about five million more shares. Philip Morris is in the midst of a 10 million-share stock buy-back program.    But some analysts also think the Cipollone aftershocks could trigger a new round of acquisitions by tobacco companies seeking to further diversify. &quot;In 1985 R.J. Reynolds bought Nabisco and Philip Morris bought General Foods, at a time litigation was first being raised as a specter,&quot; said Kurt Feuerman, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;(The tobacco companies) are clearly looking at acquisitions, although I don't know that anything's different today vs. last week.&quot;    Certainly Liggett Group, the only pure tobacco company and the only clear loser in the Cipollone case, admits that it seeks to diversify. It is &quot;looking for a company where it could capitalize on the same sources of distribution,&quot; a spokesman said. But he added that Liggett had been on the prowl since last year and not as a result of the court verdict.    But tobacco companies have at best a mixed record in making acquisitions. Some analysts note that in obtaining a food company, R.J. Reynolds -- now RJR Nabisco -- bought into an industry nearly as mature as tobacco. And Philip Morris's Miller brewing and General Foods units are regarded as less than stellar. &quot;In terms of diversification strategies, (tobacco companies) have had their ups and downs, mostly downs in many cases,&quot; said Ms. Temple, the analyst.    A Philip Morris spokesman defended Miller and General Foods, saying &quot;We've been satisfied with both acquisitions, though we think we can do better.&quot; But he conceded the units' profits inherently pale compared with those of the cigarette business, in which Philip Morris is the biggest seller.    Fueled by the success of its Marlboro brand and buoyed, like other tobacco companies, by strong export growth, Philip Morris's cigarette profits only keep rising. From 1988 to 1992, the company expects to have some $10 billion of excess cash flow, due mainly to the tobacco business.    Few think the tide against smoking can be turned by the &quot;smokeless cigarette&quot; being developed by RJR, or any other purportedly &quot;safer&quot; cigarettes in the works. But few also think smokers' consumption decline will be hastened or the companies' end-game shortened by the Cipollone case. &quot;The headlines will be here today and tomorrow, but I doubt the story has longevity,&quot; said Alvin Achenbaum, a New York marketing consultant who works with tobacco companies. &quot;There will be the legal implications, but I don't that it will do anything to affect the marketing of cigarettes.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
