It was far from clear that Iraq would succeed in the ployto drive a wedge between the U.S. and its Arab allies. Themissile attack wasn't as destructive as Iraq might havehoped. At the entreating of U.S. officials, Israel signaledthat it intended to show restraint in reacting. But itrefused to forswear any response. This morning, Lt. Gen. DanShomron, Israel's chief of staff, said that Iraqi missileattacks &quot;cannot go without a response.&quot; He added: &quot;I thinkit's still understandable that I don't intend to enter intodetails.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Zalman Shoval, Israel's ambassador to the U.S., said latelast night that Iraq may have fired more than 10 Soviet-madeScud missiles at Israel, and that at least three hitpopulated areas, two in Tel Aviv and one in Haifa. Butcasualties were light: the ambassador said six or sevenIsraelis were injured.   The attack on Israel wasn't the only escalation that Iraqileader Saddam Hussein undertook last night. His forces alsofired a Soviet-made Scud missile at the big Saudi air base inDhahran, an official said. The missile was shot down by aPatriot air-defense system that American troops brought withthem to Saudi Arabia.   Both Israel and the Pentagon concluded last night that allof the warheads contained conventional explosives, instead ofthe deadly poison gas that Iraq has in its possession. As anexplosive weapon, the SCUD is relatively modest compared tothe damage a warplane can inflict.   Still, the attack changed the complexion of theinternational military drive to expel Iraqi forces fromKuwait, which had begun just 24 hours earlier. It wasn'tclear whether the Iraqi move represented the beginning of abold counterattack by dictator Saddam Hussein or a desperateattempt to rally the Arab world to his side before hismilitary power is demolished by relentless U.S. air strikes.If last night represented Saddam Hussein's best shot atturning the course of the war, it fell well short of the markfor now.   The danger for the U.S. was that the attack -- howeverlimited in its military effect -- may arous an Israelireaction that vastly complicates the Gulf crisis. The Israeligovernment &quot;reserves the right to respond in any way it deemsfit,&quot; Ambassador Shoval said.   An Israeli strike-back would place an enormous strain onthe 28-nation international coalition opposing Iraq thatPresident Bush painstakingly assembled over the last fivemonths. Iraq is calculating that by drawing Israel into abroad Middle East war, it would turn the war into anArab-Israeli conflict and force America's Arab allies,particularly Syria and Egypt, to break from Washington'sside.   The attack even raises the risk that Jordan could be drawninto the war, because Jordan has warned that it won't allowIsraeli warplanes to fly over its space on their way tolaunch retaliatory attacks on neighboring Iraq.   But the fact that the missiles contained conventionalrather than chemical warheads reduces the political pressureon Israeli leaders to conduct a massive response. A moremodest retaliation by Israel would reduce the damage Iraq ishoping to inflict on the unity of the American-led coalitionfighting to expel it from Kuwait. When Secretary of StateJames Baker visited the region last week and discussed theprecise scenario now unfolding, he said he was assured byArab leaders in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United ArabEmirates that they recognized Israel had a right to defenditself after an attack.   Syria wasn't as reassuring. Its foreign minister said onlythat Israel shouldn't intervene.   But there now is another problem for the U.S.: In order tokeep the Israeli reaction in check, American militaryplanners may feel compelled to step up their own campaignagainst Iraq simply to demonstrate to Israeli officials thatthey don't need to move on their own to cut Iraq's militarythreat down to size.   Indeed, a Pentagon official said that the allied battleplan has been altered to hit hard at mobile Scud missilelaunchers known to remain in western Iraq. &quot;The Scud threatstill exists,&quot; the official said. &quot;The next couple of daysthere will continue to be very intensive air operations.&quot;That could push the American military campaign ahead fasterthan U.S. planners originally thought most prudent.   The Bush administration clearly was moving almostimmediately to moderate the Israeli response. Secretary ofState James Baker, who was at the White House, called IsraeliPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as well as the ambassadors fromSaudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria. The White House said Mr. Baker&quot;assured the prime minister that the U.S. is continuing itsefforts to eliminate this threat.&quot;   It seemed likely that the attack on Israel was launched bymobile Soviet-engineered Scud missiles that U.S. officialsconceded they didn't hit in their initial bombing raids onIraqi targets because the missiles weren't immediately found.Gen. Colin Powell and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney hadearlier warned U.S. lawmakers in briefings yesterday thatthey were still concerned about the mobile Scud missiles.They said pilots were told to keep any eye out for the mobileSCUDS, and try to eliminate them if they could.   It was clear early yesterday that more of Baghdad'smilitary machine survived the first onslaught from the U.S.than some initially thought.   Contrary to initial reports, Iraq's Air Force wasn't allbut destroyed in Wednesday night's raids. Rather, seniorPentagon oficials said, it appeared that less than half ofIraq's planes were destroyed in those first missions.   Beginning prior to the Scud attack, the U.S. was launchingwave after wave of aircraft at Iraq yesterday and last night.As of late in the day, it counted just one plane lost withits pilot killed. Two British jets and a Kuwaiti jet alsowere downed.   In many cases, attacking Allied-force planes headed backto the same priority military targets struck in the firstwaves, hoping to complete the destruction. Officials said thewar was likely to remain strictly an air campaign for somedays, before ground assaults and amphibious landings areattempted -- unless Iraq's response changes in such a way asto demand faster ground action.   Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, said that while Iraq's air force, command-and-controlsystem and missile systems had been heavily damaged, theyhadn't been put out of commission fully.   Privately, senior military officials said clouds over Iraqhad prevented space satellites from rendering as detailed areport on the damage as the Pentagon had sought.   Many of the remaining planes were believed confined totheir bases by damage to runways and buildings. But militaryofficials observed that runways can be repaired quickly andneed to be hit again and again. Damage to chemical andnuclear plants and to command posts is harder to assessquickly, they said.   Of particular concern to the Pentagon were planes hiddenin hardened bunkers or dispersed to distant bases, and mobileScud missile launchers that still could lob chemical warheadsinto Israeli or Saudi cities.   Gen. Powell said &quot;all of our systems are tuned up andqueued, trying to locate mobile Scud launchers, of course.&quot;   He added: &quot;If they leave their airplanes in bunkers, thenthose airplanes are not up giving us difficulty. And we knowwhere the bunkers are, and in due course, we will take careof it.&quot;   Another critical target is Iraq's elite Republican Guardtroops, who are expected to be the heart of Baghdad'sresistance on the ground. It isn't certain how much damagethese forces suffered, but several top military officialsscoffed at early reports the units had been &quot;decimated.&quot;   Pentagon officials said the Air Force last night wasstaging intense bombing raids on Iraqi ground troops,especially the Republican Guards. But they described asexaggerated some reports from Saudi Arabia which describedthe attacks as saturation &quot;carpet bombing.&quot;   Overall, the Pentagon said U.S. pilots had flown over1,000 missions in the first 14 hours and hundreds more asyesterday wore on. Gen. Powell said those missions, called&quot;sorties,&quot; were judged 80% effective. That means 80% of themsucceeded in delivering their weapons and returning. He saidthe rest either had mechanical problems, ran into badweather, or weren't able to pinpoint their targets.   The U.S. flights came in addition to missions flown byBritish, French, Saudi and Kuwaiti pilots and at least 100launches of conventionally-armed Tomahawk cruise missiles.   Throughout the day, Pentagon officials tried to temper theelation initially aroused by the first night's sorties. &quot;Wehave landed our first, best punch,&quot; a senior Pentagonofficial explained, &quot;It's been very effective. But he {SaddamHussein} still has a very powerful army for us to cope with.Remember, he never said he'd beat us with his air force.&quot;   The same view was echoed by outside experts. &quot;Let's notget too euphoric,&quot; said retired Admiral Thomas Moorer, formerchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. &quot;They {the U.S.military} have got to analyze what they did, and determinewhich targets need restriking to make this a thoroughsuccess.&quot;   &quot;It's early days,&quot; said former Defense Secretary HaroldBrown. &quot;It is a very successful and effective beginning, butthe first reports of damage are almost always too optimistic.And the main attack on ground forces is yet to come.&quot;   &quot;It could be like Libya,&quot; said defense analyst PierreSprey. &quot;Smart weapons didn't do very well in Libya. Until weget photographic evidence, we won't know how well we did inIraq.&quot;   Mr. Sprey, for one, expects the allied raids missed moretargets than they hit. What's more, many types of targets,even if hit hard, can be repaired fairly quickly.   &quot;Airfields would be very easily reconstituted,&quot; Mr. Spreysaid. &quot;So would communications towers and radars. In Vietnam,it was our experience that it was almost impossible to putout radar for more than 24 hours.&quot;   ---   Robert S.
