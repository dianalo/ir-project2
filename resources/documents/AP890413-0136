(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former executives of a Californiadefense contractor were convicted of conspiracy and wire fraudThursday in the first trial arising from the Pentagon corruptionscandal.   A federal court jury deliberated nearly 36 hours over four daysbefore returning guilty verdicts against George Kaub and EugeneSullivan, former vice presidents of Teledyne Electronics of NewburyPark, Calif.   Each was convicted on one count of conspiracy. Kaub was foundguilty on five counts of wire fraud and two counts of filing falsestatements. Sullivan was convicted on three counts of wire fraud.   A third defendant, Dale Schnittjer, was acquitted on conspiracyand wire fraud charges by U.S. District Judge Richard Williamsafter the jury failed to reach a verdict against him. Schnittjer isalso a former vice president of Teledyne Electronics.   All the defendants were found innocent of bribery, a chargestemming from the government's contention that the formerexecutives knew money was paid to a Navy engineer for insideinformation about a $24 million contract for hand-held radar testequipment.   Kaub, who faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in jail and afine of $2 million, hung his head and stared at the defense tableafter the bailiff read the verdict.   Sullivan could be sentenced to 20 years in jail and fined amaximum of $1 million. He appeared impassive.   Schnittjer had a hint of a smile on his face.   Williams set sentencing for June 7 as attorneys for Kaub andSullivan said they would appeal the verdict.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said he was pleased withthe convictions, which he called significant.``This sends a messageto corporate America that they cannot wash their hands of this typeof activity,'' he said after the four women and eight men returnedtheir verdict.   He said the government's ``Ill Wind'' investigation intokickbacks, payoffs and fraud in the Defense Department's$150-billion-a-year purchasing system was ``expanding andcontinuing.''   The Pentagon procurement investigation began in mid-1986 but wasnot publicly disclosed until June 1988, when federal agents armedwith search warrants descended on defense contractors fromcoast-to-coast.   The first indictment was handed up in January. Besides the threeTeledyne executives, it names private consultants William Parkinand Fred Lackner; Stuart Berlin, a Navy official, and TeledyneIndustries, the parent of Teledyne Electronics.   All pleaded guilty in advance of the trial execept for thecompany officials. Teledyne pleaded guilty to conspiracy and filingfalse statements. It paid $4.3 million in fines, penalties anddamages.   During the trial, Parkin and Lackner testified they had paidbribes to Berlin in exchange for his illegal help on the radarcontract Teledyne was awarded in July 1987. Berlin admittedreceiving Teledyne's money passed through the consultants.   Aronica argued that Kaub, Sullivan and Schnittjer had conspiredto pay Parkin a total of $160,000 for his help on the radarcontract. Most of the money, $150,000, was to be paid after thecontract came through, he said.   According to Aronica, the defendants, whom he described as``smart ... capable ... and very, very careful,'' knew that Parkinand his associates were engaged in illegitimate activites. ``Everystep possible was taken to conceal it,'' he said.   Defense attorneys, however, said their clients were the victimsof a conspiracy devised by Parkin, Lackner, Berlin and MichaelSavaides, another former Teledyne employee who worked in Washingtonand had pleaded guilty.   ``My client was kept in the dark,'' George O'Connell, Sullivan'slawyer, said in his closing argument.   Much of the evidence in the case came from wire taps that thegovernment placed on Parkin's telephone. The jury listened to tapesof the conservations between Parkin and the defendants. The wirefraud counts stemmed from those tape-recorded conversations.   Kaub was charged with filing false statements because heauthorized notifying the Defense Department that Teledyne had nothired consultants to work on the radar contract.   Schnittjer's attorney, Stanley Mortenson, said his client cameto Teledyne Electronics after the company had been awarded theradar contract.   But Aronica said Schnittjer was the person who paid Parkin morethan $18,000 of the $150,000 he was to receive once the Pentagonordered the equipment from Teledyne.   Parkin, a former Navy official who worked for a variety ofdefense contractors including Boeing, signed his original contractwith Teledyne in November 1985.   Payments stopped once the Ill Wind investigation became public.   The jury found Schnittjer innocent of four wire fraud counts,but it could not reach a unanimous decision on whether Schnittjerwas guilty of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud.   Williams, at Mortenson's request, dismissed those counts.</TEXT></DOC>
