Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky also announced, ata news conference devoted entirely to ecology, that the SovietUnion two days ago ratified the 1987 Montreal treaty on protectingthe ozone layer.   Petrovsky told reporters that life on earth ``transcendedideological differences.''   He called for an environmental summit meeting of 15 to 20 topworld leaders, proposed a series of international meetings on theenvironment and said funds saved from disarmament should be used toupgrade the environment.   Petrovsky said the Soviet Union would follow international lawsand regulations concerning the environment, including compensationthat could be paid for environmental accidents, like the Chernobylnuclear plant disaster.   Moscow has seldom, if ever before, championed environmentalcauses and has been notably absent from joining internationalecological decrees. The Soviets have been known more for exportingarms and building heavy, often polluting, industry in the ThirdWorld.   Now, Moscow says, saving the Amazon rain forests, ending toxicwaste dumping in Africa and saving endangered species are high onits list of priorities.   The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 awakened his government to thedangers of nuclear radiation and a broad policy debate was underway, Petrovsky said.   The pollution of Lake Baykal in Asia and dangerous emissions byautomobiles also were serious problems and would be addressed, hesaid in answer to questions about what the Soviet Union would do inits own territory.   ``Ensuring environmental security has become second only toeliminating the nuclear risk in the battle for the survival ofmankind,'' said Petrovsky, who is attending the 43rd GeneralAssembly.   His statement echoed the words of Soviet Foreign Minister EduardA. Shevardnadze, who devoted more time to the environment than todisarmament in his recent speech to the assembly.   Petrovsky called protection of the environment an example ofSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``new political thinking''and an important part of a new comprehensive system ofinternational peace and security.   He said that just as the world must transcend blocs and nationalpolitics to save the world from nuclear war, so it also mustaddress environmental problems on a global scale.   Petrovsky said, ``The biosphere does not accept discussion fromstrength, division of the world into systems and blocs. Ittranscends ideological differences.''   He proposed an International Environmental Security Fund,channeling funds from phased-out or defunct military programs intoecological concerns. He proposed the United Nations play a largerrole in safeguarding the environment and said ``an internationalmechanism'' must be created to work out solutions regarding urgentecological problems.   Petrovsky proposed three emergency meetings under U.N. auspices:   _In 1989 a meeting of international experts on the health of theearth.   _In 1990 a meting of the top leaders of 15 to 20 nationsrepresenting all continents and the Non-Aligned Movement.   _A second U.N. international conference on the environment to beattended by heads of state and government, before the 1992 targetdate.   Petrovsky also said the international community should adoptbinding principles and rules of behavior. He said these wouldinclude broad exchange of information on ecological questions;mutual access to advanced technologies, and strict accountabilityof states for their environmental protection activities andecological accidents.</TEXT></DOC>
