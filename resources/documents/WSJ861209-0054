The new tax law softens the sting by generally giving workers full rights to their retirement benefits after five years instead of the previously mandated 10. But, says consultant Hewitt Associates, employees who change employers even after five years can still end their careers with far smaller retirement benefits than those with similar pay records who spend all their time with one concern.    The job-hopper penalty is especially severe at companies with defined-benefit plans, since such pensions are often based on the last five years' pay. For career employees, these last five years generally bring the biggest earnings; earlier lower-paying years are ignored. For job-switchers, however, calculations are based on the last five years at each company, years of low earnings as well as years of high pay.    Job-switching is also penalized by defined-contribution plans if workers must wait before becoming eligible.    MALE vs. FEMALE: What a difference it makes in business careers.    Separate surveys of corporate officers by executive search firms -- one of females by Heidrick andamp; Struggles and one essentially of only males by Korn/Ferry International -- underscore sharp disparities in the routes, rewards and penalties of getting to the top. The male officers tend to be older, 51 against 44, and have been at their companies longer. Though they put in the same 55-hour weeks, the men earn $215,000 a year, compared to $116,810 for the women.    To advance their careers, 82% of the women say they have paid with personal sacrifices. One in five never married; among males, only 0.7% have never wed. One-fifth of the women are separated or divorced, five times the male rate. More than half are childless; 95% of the men had children, and the average had three.    INSIDER-TRADING SCANDAL prompts renewed warnings at some concerns.    Lotus Development Corp. dispatches strongly worded letters to its workers cautioning against stock trading based on inside information. At Raytheon Co., a new videotape and booklet are going out this month on a whole host of ethical questions, including the handling of confidential information; this supplements specific warnings against insider dealings that come from the legal department twice a year.    But CBS Inc. -- the setting of a takeover drama and a management shake-up in recent months -- says it's satisfied with its policies in place. It says warnings on confidential information and insider trading have been presented to each new employee for the past five years; it doesn't see any need to sound the clarions anew.    National Medical Enterprises also is standing pat; &quot;we think our policies are working reasonably well.&quot;    LOOKING FOR A JOB during the holiday season isn't such a dumb idea, says Costello, Erdlen andamp; Co. Employment activity slackens in December, but companies running ads now &quot;are serious about filling their openings immediately,&quot; the consultant explains. &quot;And there are fewer respondents.&quot;    WHO GETS THE BONUS? The boss gets the biggest one, according to an analysis of proxy statements by consultant Towers, Perrin, Forster andamp; Crosby. In 1985, chief executives received bonuses equivalent to 73% of their base pay. Down the chain of command, the bonuses slimmed noticeably -- to 68% of base pay for the second-highest-paid executive, and to 57% for No. 3.    SMOKING RESTRICTIONS spread beyond the federal restraints imposed this past week. The Administrative Management Society says 42% of the companies responding to its poll said they had official policies on the rights of smokers and nonsmokers. In 1980, only 16% had such rules.    SHARING THE WEALTH, New York style. The state is turning over to private employers the names of top performers on a civil service test for college graduates seeking administrative careers. &quot;We get many more candidates than we can can place,&quot; an official explains.    THOUGH PAY DEFERRALS lift payroll costs, companies allow more of them.    Lower individual tax rates coming in 1987 and 1988 are tempting some executives to postpone income due this year and next. But lower business tax rates, also coming, mean that each of those deferred compensation dollars will cost employers 22% more after taxes than they do today. Yet, a survey by consultant A.S. Hansen finds that 23% of major U.S. corporations are allowing executives to defer more income; only 3% are making them cut back.    FPL Group, the holding company for Florida Power andamp; Light Co., says it is working up a plan to allow executives to defer a portion of their salaries and bonuses for several years. Ryder System Inc. acknowledges a rush to defer could cost it money, but it doesn't view the added expense as &quot;a big concern.&quot;    CDI Corp., however, says it mulled modifying its deferral policy and concluded it was just &quot;too much trouble.&quot;    THE CHECKOFF: Frisk the computer! Retailers blame only three-quarters of their inventory &quot;shrinkage&quot; on theft, says Arthur Young andamp; Co., CPAs. A quarter of the loss stems from poor records. . . . For corporate presents this Christmas to employees and clients, don't give food or cash, says Best Products Co., which sells merchandise gifts: &quot;If you can spend it or eat it, it doesn't make a very lasting impression.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
