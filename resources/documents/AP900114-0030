They were accused of giving a false account after militaryofficers viewed ABC-TV videotape of the shooting, said an armyspokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Also Sunday, a Palestinian man died of gunshot wounds sufferedin a clash between masked Arabs and Israeli soldiers three weeksago in the Gaza Strip, the army said.   The victim was identified as Abdulla al-Rekhawi, 42, of theRafah refugee camp. Two other Palestinians were killed in the clash.   After al-Rekhawi's funeral, Palestinians blocked roads withstone barricades and burned tires, Arab reports said.   His death raised to 647 the number of Palestinians killed byIsraelis in the 25-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israelirule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   At least 170 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, moston suspicion of collaborating with Israel, and 43 Israelis havedied.   The border policemen, members of a paramilitary unit that workswith army troops in the territories, were suspended by Maj. Gen.Yitzhak Mordechai, head of the army's Central Command, andInspector Gen. Meshulam Amit, the border police commander.   The victim, 18-year-old Fadi Zabakli of Bethlehem, was shot inthe head during a demonstration Dec. 28 and died Jan. 7.   The army initially said Zabakli and fellow Palestinians carriedaxes and ignored warning shots and orders to halt.   Troops are required to shout a warning and fire in the airbefore aiming at a suspect's legs.   Mordechai ordered a probe after ABC-TV reported that the youthswere not armed and that no warning shots were fired. The videotapewas aired Saturday on Israel television.   The names of the two men charged were not made public.   Meanwhile, a military court demoted Israeli Lt. David Lior tothe rank of sergeant and sentenced him to 45 days in jail formistreating a Palestinian prisoner, army radio said.   According to the radio, Lior kicked and beat a Palestinian afterthe suspect cursed him in a jeep en route to the lockup. ThePalestinian was apprehended for throwing stones.   Also Sunday, Italy's ambassador to Israel, Alberto Bartoli,filed a protest on behalf of the European Community with theIsraeli Foreign Ministry over police handling of peace rallies inJerusalem last month.   More than 50 people were injured Dec. 30 when police charged asection of the crowd that had gathered to form a ``human chain''for peace around Jerusalem's Old City. Many were Italian and otherEuropean activists.   Police said stones and bottles were thrown, but reporters saw nostone throwing before the police moved in.   A day earlier, police fired tear gas and used night sticks tobreak up a women's peace march after an outlawed Palestinian flagwas raised.   Bartoli's statement criticized ``unjustified use of generalizedviolence against hundreds of people during authorized, peacefuldemonstrations.''   The statement also criticized Israel's decision last week to banforeign travel by nine Palestinian activists. It said the actionwas ``not conducive to the climate of confidence necessary for any(peace) negotiation.''</TEXT></DOC>
