(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OBJECTS AND DISTRIBUTED network computing were made for each otherDistributed network computing supports diversity: of operating systems,applications, databases, and input/output devices.andP;  While making moreresources available to users, this scheme also raises complexity.andP;  From theuser's perspective, format conversions are a nuisance, and even understandingwhat's on the network can be difficult.andP;  If this is the case, networks won'tbe used to their full potential.andM;Applying object orientation to distributed network computing reduces thiscomplexity and promises to raise overall usability.andP;  Distributed objectmanagement raises the details of interaction across networks to high -levelabstractions.andP;  Datafiles are associated with applications: Call a salesreport object, and a data file is given to you in the appropriate applicationcontext.andP;  Printing is as simple as dropping a Me icon on a printer icon.andP;  Thesame applies for fax and mail.andP;  Underneath the covers, network protocols,compound document data streams, and document conversion routines are at work,but the user isn't exposed to them.andM;What is distributed object management? Object management describesapplications and other resources as objects&quot;black boxes,&quot; from the user'sperspective-to make them easy to manipulate and integrate.andP;  These objects welike building blocks that users themselves employ to structure their use ofnetwork resources.andP;  Distributed object management extends this paradigmacross networks (see illustration below).andM;This notion of objects is borrowed from the object-oriented design paradigm.andO;Resources are specified as abstract objects-encapsulated bundles of data,properties, and operations.andP;  These objects communicate with other objectsthrough interfaces; their internals are kept hidden from view.andP;  A user tellsa document object to print, and the object itself invokes that operation, ormethod, on itself.andP;  Extending this concept across a network requires anadditional layer of interobject communication, both methods and protocols.andM;&quot;The principle in object-oriented application-to-application communication is'Ask, don't touch.' That has to work on both the local level and on thedistributed level,&quot; says Bob Bressler, vice president of research anddevelopment for 3Com Corporation.andP;  &quot;We don't want the applications to care ifthere's a network.&quot;andM;This article examines the distributed object management (DOM) systems underdevelopment at IBM, Digital, Data General, Unisys, Hewlett-Packard/Apollo,and 3Com.andP;  These are the first of their kind-DOM is virgin territory-and theyare described here for the first time.andP;  The article concludes with anexamination of the future of electronic mail and objects.andM;Job #1: Reduce ComplexityandM;The list priority for network objects is reducing the complexity ofdistributed network computing.andP;  This is a model that assumes that diverseresources from different manufacturers are attached to the network.andP;  Itdemands transparent access to these resources and intelligent interactionbetween them.andP;  The more users and even network administrators are aware ofthe network, the slower applications of distributed network computing willprogress.andM;In distributed object management, printers and services like mail,applications, and files are defined as objects.andP;  Ideally, these objects arerepresented as icons on a user's display.andP;  Printing a document becomes assimple as dragging an icon representing the document file over to an iconrepresenting the printer and dropping it.andP;  This simple user action kicks intoaction directories and object management systems to get die task done.andO;Directly manipulable icons aren't a prequisite, however.andP;  There's also a needto front-end distributed object management with character-based displays.andO;Failure to do so will leave millions of terminal and character-based PC usersstranded in the past.andM;Specifying network resources as objects yields other interestingopponunities.andP;  Take security.andP;  Access levels can be defined as behaviors ofobject classes.andP;  This makes the access status of resources and the accessrights of users consistent and makes changes to security statusstraightforward.andM;As noted earlier, ease-of-use extends to the managers of networks as well asto users.andP;  By abstracting network resources to a set of specifications thatis independent of the implementaion of those specifications, distributedobject management makes networks inherently flexible.andP;  Network configurationis dramatically simplified using this approach.andP;  When resources or users areadded to the network, their identity, location, access rights, and so on arecollected in an interface, usually at the nearest server or directoryservice.andP;  Other members of the network can then work with the new resource.andO;Also, adding a new kind of printer to the network will be a matter ofextending the class defining printer objects to encompass the new printer'scharacteristics.andM;Objects also open interesting possibilities for network administration.andP;  Aclass of network object, say, a fax server queue, can be given thecharacteristic of usage sensitivity.andP;  Every time the &quot;star fax&quot; method isinvoked on that object, it automatically sends a &quot;usage notification&quot; methodto a metering object.andP;  The metering object then spits out reports every weekfor the network administrator.andM;Next Step: Reusable ComponentsandM;In the long term, object management will enable a new approach toapplications.andP;  The object building blocks on networks will get smaller andmore specialized, and users will use them to build applications specific totheir jobs.andP;  Rather than buy a word processor with an integral, inferioroutliner, users will be able to combine a text processing object with anoutliner object to get the best function on demand.andP;  Distributed objectmanagement promises to extend this notion across networks and across thesystems and software of different vendors.andM;Reusability is where the real payoff of object orientation lies.andP;  As objectmanagement systems spread, more and more objects-tools, pieces ofapplications, routines, etc.-will become available to users.andP;  Objectmanagement holds the promise of allowing sophisticated users to plug theseinto patterns that serve their individualized needs locally or acrossnetworks.andP;  But reusability is a benefit largely dependent on standards oragreements that allow objects from multiple vendors to play together onheterogeneous networks.andP;  Pulling off distributed object management systems isa difficult technical challenge, but the standards question is even tougher.andM;The Object Management GroupandM;Fortunately, a group of vendors and users has begun addressing the standardsissues.andP;  The Object Management Group (OMG) was formed in April byHewlett-Packard, Data General, Unisys, 3Com, Sun Microsystems, AmericanAirlines, and five others.andP;  Working groups are being formed now in thevarious technical areas of interest.andM;Object management and its distributed offshoot are in their infancy.andP;  Theprinciple example of object management adopted by the OMG-the ObjectManagement Facility (OMF) in Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) NewWave-isn't even dueout until the end of the year.andP;  Yet, major vendors recognize that theopportunity of distributed object management is greatest if multivendorsystems are involved.andM;&quot;There's been a change in the industry,&quot; says Mark Koschmann, vice presidentof research and development for Unisys.andP;  &quot;Previously, each company did itsown proprietary architecture.andP;  But customers don't want that anymore.&quot;andM;There are some big names missing from the OMG's roster of members.andP;  NeitherIBM nor Digital nor ATandamp;T has joined, not to mention Microsoft, Lotus, andNovell.andP;  Digital and ATandamp;T sent informal representatives to the OMG's firstmeeting, and are clearly interested.andP;  OMG's challenge is to bring others intothe fold.andM;DOM: The ConceptsandM;Distributed object management (DOM) adds a network to object management.andP;  Butwhat does that mean? A DOM system requires five basic components.andM;An object model of the network, which starts at the workstations at the frontend and extends across the network to servers and other workstations.andM;An object registration/management facility, which keepsandM;track of the pointers to the various components of each object, or someequivalent.andP;  Vendors are using two approaches to object registration.andP;  Thefirst is to place it in the hands of individual applications.andP;  Apple andDigital do this today.andP;  The second is to use an independent facility.andP;  Up'sNewWave Object Management Facility, IBM's Object Registration Facility, andthe similar facilities under development at Data General and Unisys are theleading examples.andM;* A duality of objects, for the sake of performance.andP;  Views ofandM;data and their underlying data should be separated but linked on the network.andO;All vendors of object management systems implement this separation in oneform or another.andP;  (See illustration above.)andM;* Communications methods, like remote procedure calls, inandM;terprocess communications, and even electronic mail, and the protocols thatsupport object interaction across links.andM;*Object directories, which function as repositories of informaandM;tion about objects on the network and their relationships to other objects.andO;All vendors are working on directories based on the X.500 standard of theInternational Standards Organization (ISO).andP;  X.500 isn't complete, and sovendors we adding extensions with the proviso that they'll align with thestandard when it is complete.andM;Data General's Object UtilityandM;Data General's blueprint for the '90s is Distributed Application Architecture(DAA).andP;  DAA uses object orientation and open standards to integrateworkstations, servers, and compute engineson distributed networks.andP;  DG hasbeen putting the foundation for DAA in place during the last year-we Motorola88000 chip, OSI protocols, and de facto standards like Novell's NetWare andTCP/IP.andP;  But that's just the plumbing.andP;  The key to the architecture isdistributed object management.andP;  Products implementing DAA will come late thisyear or early next.andM;Data General's goal with DAA is to transform complex network computingresources into a user-controlled, flexible utility.andP;  That means users willhave access to rich information resources on networks and be able to usethem-without knowing where they reside, in what combination they're beingused, or which vendor made them.andP;  Data General calls this &quot;user-centeredcomputing.&quot; It is enabled by applying object orientation to the management ofnetwork resources.andM;Standards are the basis for DAA, and Data General can be expected to producea portable network environment.andP;  This means servers will be based on Unix,and system services will be transport and network independent.andP;  DG isimplementing DAA in this way so that it can sell its products to OEMs.andO;Third-party distribution is a keystone of DG's strategy.andM;CONCEPTS.andP;  DAA is built on the client-server architecture.andP;  Clients can beany of the major major workstation platforms, including OS/2 withPresentation Manager, Unix workstations with Motif, the Macintosh, MS-DOSwith Windows, and character-based terminals.andP;  DAA will rely on Unix serversto provide basic network services-directories, gateways, systemmanagement-and shared user facilities like mad, time management, and files.andO;(See illustration below.)andM;OBJECTS.andP;  There we three kinds of objects in DG's scheme, &quot;Presentationobjects&quot; are views of &quot;functional objects.' A functional object might be atext file linked to a word processing program.andP;  It resides on a server, andusers at workstations work with views of it.andP;  &quot;Service objects&quot;-Mail, print,gateway-are the third kind of objectandM;Objects can be as small as dates and names or as large as documents andapplications.andP;  The architecture is designed to handle a range of granularity.andO;DG's model supports classes and multiple inheritance, aggregate objects,dynamic binding of data and methods, a variety of transaction models,security, and versions of objects.andM;THE OBJECT DATA MODEL.andP;  The object data model describes the network as acollection of objects.andP;  It specifies multiuser access to shared objects,supports queries of network databases, is SQL-based database independent,defines shared services like mail and files, and is the locus ofadministration and management control and security for the network.andM;OBJECT REGISTRATION/ MANAGEMENT.andP;  The Object Database (ODB) is thecornerstone of DAA.andP;  It is really an object manager like the ObjectManagement Facility (Ow in NewWave, as opposed to a full database managementsystem (DBMS).andP;  The ODB is layered atop any SQL-based relational DBMS engine.andM;DG's ODB is to networks what the OMF is to workstations-and then some.andP;  TheOMF links the elements that make up an object-data files and programfiles-and manages their calling and interaction.andP;  DG's ODB, using a directoryservice, establishes the links between object components, between objects ina compound object, and between functional objects like documents and serviceobjects like printers, inboxes, and calendars.andP;  Unlike NewWave's OBF, DG'sfacility also provides multiple inheritance, security, and other services.andM;The ODB simplifies application development into four elements:andM;A class, which describes objects as being related and able to inheritproperties and data from one another.andP;  Printers might be placed in a class,for example.andP;  A class can be a superclass of another class or an aggregate ofother classes, and can have associated methods and attributes that areindividually named.andM;An instance, which is a manifestation of a class.andP;  InstancesandM;can be associated with a named attribute, with other instances (comprising anaggregate object), or with an associative link to another instance.andM;* Amethod, which is a behavior, or operation, supported byandM;classes of objects.andP;  The print method would be supported by text objects aswell as table objects.andM;*A link, which connects two classes or instances of classes.andP;  OBJECT SQL.andO;The ODB is written in C as an object-oriented application.andP;  DG provides anobject-oriented version of the SQL language as the interface for workstationapplications to access network services.andP;  DG's object extensions to SQL addnew syntax, hke Execute Method (name of class, etc.), Bind To and Unbind From(database identification), Create and Delete (instance nature of class name,etc.).andP;  This syntax is directed both at interaction with the database and&quot;tension of the classes and methods supported in the system.andP;  The Create andModify statements are the way new superclasses, attributes, and parts areadded to class objects and methods.andP;  DG intends to make its Object SQL (OSQL)available to OEMs and standards bodies.andP;  It has trademarked OSQL, and acopyright of its extensions is pending.andM;OSQL Application Development Utilities.andP;  An ODB Object Structure Generatorand an ODB OSQL Preprocessor help developers generate the C applications codethat actually manipulates the database and the network objects it holds.andP;  TheObject Structure Generator yields C structures for manipulating theattributes of an instance of an object using OSQL.andP;  The OSQL Preprocessortransforms OSQL statements into C code so that they can be executed via aremote procedure call (RPC).andM;DAA also provides a Local Object Manager for Unix and OS/2 workstations thatcreates and manages die links between elements in objects on workstations.andO;The Local Object Manager is not implemented for DOS PCs or terminals.andM;VIEW-DATA SEPARATION.andP;  Presentation objects and functional objects separateviews of an object from its actual semantics.andP;  In addition to supportingbetter network performance, this scheme allows DG to slip its object systemunder the native user interfaces of a whole host of workstations.andP;  DG hasdefined a Task Language to link the two levels of objects.andM;COMMUNICATION METHODS.andP;  DG divides networked resources into &quot;shared objectdomains&quot; based wound Unix servers.andP;  Users are typically associated with oneobject domain.andP;  They can get access to other domains directly, by asking fora resource by name, or they can ask for a display of services on otherdomains.andP;  For example, if the fax server in a domain goes down, users in thatdomain could find the fax servers in other domains and request access tothem.andP;  What's missing from this scheme is a global object manager.andP;  A globalview of network resources could help optimize resource utilization and trackusage patterns to help in load-balancing.andP;  Development of this capability isclearly a direction for DG.andM;Distribution is provided in DAA via remote procedure calls and distributedservices.andP;  In its active role, the ODB is itself an application that plays arole in processing.andP;  An RPC is used only to pass methods to the ODB forexecution, distributing an application's processing between server and clientto optimal balance.andM;DG has designed the Application Access Protocol (AAP) to support clientserverinteraction with functional objects.andP;  A Service Access Protocol invokesspecific service operations.andP;  These protocols support four methods that giveusers access to applications and resources independent of LAN transports andRPC mechanisms.andM;* Get AttributeandM;* Set AttributeandM;* Execute MethodandM;* Get Class HandleandM;This model prefers that methods be executed on objects where those objectsreside.andP;  Objects don't zip around the network, although they could if theuser preferred that.andP;  Objects can be moved, but not dynamically.andP;  OBJECTDIRECTORY AND OTHER SERVICES.andP;  Six services are defined as service objects.andO;Conceptually, these objects define separate services that plug into a commonbackplane.andP;  Distributed services like mail will be implemented by allowingobjects on separate ODB servers to interact using the directory serverobject.andP;  The directory server is implemented using the X.500 internationalstandard for directory services.andM;Other service objects are authentication, security, verification,notification, and system management.andP;  Each of these may be replicated tooptimize resource utilization, network loads, and availability.andP;  For example,the mail service may be implemented as replicated &quot;post office&quot; objects ondifferent nodes.andP;  The user's inbox and outbox may reside on the same node asthe local post office object, but don't necessarily have to.andP;  Apollo:NewWave's Missing Link?andM;NewWave and its Object Management Facility provide strong object managementsupport on DOS workstations today, and HP plans to make OMF the heart of adistributed object management system based on OS/2 and Unix.andP;  HP was juststarting to design a way for OMF to be extended across networks when itbought Apollo Computer.andM;Apollo's experience in object orientation is the sleeper in the HP purchase.andO;Yes, HP will benefit from the market share in engineering workstations itpicked up in the deal, but Apollo's work in defining an object-orienteddistributed network architecture also fills a gap in HP's object strategy.andO;At the time of the purchase, Apollo had begun work on a set of protocolsdefining interaction between objects on a distributed network.andP;  At presstime, this effort, called the Common Store Project, was intact.andP;  We believethe project will lay the foundation for HP to extend NewWave over networks(see illustration above).andM;CONCEPTS: OBJECTS.andP;  The basic NewWave object is a datafile that knows whichapplication operates on it.andP;  This is called application/data binding, and itapplies the basic notion of encapsulation to datafiles.andP;  In NewWave, objectsare responsible for creating and maintaining their own information.andP;  A salesreport object might comprise an Excel data file linked to the Excelspreadsheet program.andP;  Users click, and the application and file are summoned.andM;TYPES OF OBJECTS.andP;  Applications bound with data are known in NewWave asSimple Objects or User Objects.andP;  Other kinds of objects included areContainers, Office Tools, and Compound Objects.andM;* Containers hold other objects.andP;  Folders, for &quot;ample, are obandM;jects.andM;* Office Tools are facilities like file drawers, printers, and theandM;waste basket.andP;  These are immutable.andM;* Compound Objects comprise simple objects or other comandM;pound objects.andP;  They respond to commands as if they were single entities.andP;  Ifa compound object is told to print, it will pass the command on to itssubobjects.andM;OBJECT REGISTRATION/MANAGEMENT.andP;  NewWave's OMF is a directory of referenceslinking datafiles and application programs.andP;  To the user, these linkedentities are objects.andP;  OMF manages the bindings between datafiles andapplication progams, manages system services like office tools, and providesinformation links between objects.andM;OMF creates and manages file names for the datafiles that are pan of anobject.andP;  When an object is invoked, OMF passes the the name to theappropriate application.andP;  Datafiles and program files are kept in differentsubdirectories.andP;  The user is entirely shielded from the DOS file system, OMFeven automatically distributes datafiles among multiple subdirectories tooptimize performance.andM;VIEW-DATA SEPARATION.andP;  Hp has demonstrated a prototype network version ofNewWave-based on technology that will go into the OS/2 and Unix versions ofthe environment-that allows users to invoke objects arrayed in an &quot;outeroffice&quot; area of their displays.andP;  Network printers, for example, arerepresented by icons in this special area.andP;  Users can drag a document iconfrom their local NewWave Office to a printer icon in the &quot;outer office&quot; touse a network printer.andP;  Users designate local objects as network/sharableobjects by placing them into their outer offices.andP;  This scheme also extendsthe live links between objects permitted under NewWave across a network.andM;This approach builds knowledge of the network into local ONEs.andP;  Local OUFsaccess remote objects and retum Views of those objects.andP;  The underlying,persistent object remains on its hos&quot; only a view of it travels across thenetwork.andP;  The link between object view and object semantics is the Agent TaskLanguage, which functions like a protocol operating across the network tolink two ONFs.andM;This approach works, although it is a little rough.andP;  Certainly, users areaware of the network.andP;  In DG's DAA, by comparison, objects aren't separatedinto local and network categories, although they can be.andP;  HP hasn't announceda network capability because it is still setting details like how to managemultiuser access of remote application and service objects.andP;  HP doesn't planto support distributed object links under DOS.andP;  DOS simply doesn't providethe preemptive, multitasking system that can efficiently manage networkinteractions between objects.andP;  However, DOS users will be able to move andcopy objects to and from OS/2 and Unix workstations or servers.andM;We expect HP's solution to be based on Apollo Computer's Network ComputingArchitecture (NCA), which has already brought us the Network Computing System(NCS) remote procedure call mechanism and the NCA Location Broker directoryservice.andP;  NewWave and NCA are simpatico in their views of objects, andthere's every reason to expect that HP will layer its application environmenton Apollo's network computing framework and Unix.andM;THE COMMON STORE PROJECT.andP;  Apollo's Common Store project will develop theprotocols needed to support distributed object management under Apollo'sNetwork Computing Architecture.andP;  Apollo's plan is to provide the same basiccommunications facilities as Data General will in its DAA.andP;  The differencesare that NCA is based on one RPC mechanism, the Remote Computing System(RCS), and Apollo is later than DG getting out of the starting blocks.andO;Indeed, man details of Apollo's plan are not clear at this point.andP;  Whatfollows is a discussion of the strategy,andM;Objects in the Network Computing Architecture are like those defined byNewWave and Data General's DAA.andP;  Printers, files, applications, and so on arethe basic objects recognized by the system; each has a unique identifier.andO;Actions on die system are performed on objec ts, but the entity invoking theaction may or may not itself be an object.andM;SERVER-CENTRIC DESIGN.andP;  The Network Computing Architecture is based on aclient-server model.andP;  All objects on die network are registered with aserver.andP;  For example, a print server is responsible for print queue objects;it registers and manages them.andP;  The server, in turn, &quot;announces&quot; its set ofobjects to the network by registering it with a global location broker.andP;  Eachserver updates the state of its object set at different intervals.andM;Any object that has been &quot;announced&quot; by its server is assumed to be active byApollo's current implementation of NCA.andP;  The NCS run-time system knows how toget to objects and sets up a pipe to reach them.andP;  Thus, NCA does not includeobject activation/deactivation at this point.andP;  Apollo concedes that thisfacility isn't appropriate when objects are in storage rather than active.andO;This is an area of development for NCS.andM;Object names operate on two levels.andP;  Each is automatically tagged with aunique system identifier when it is added to the network.andP;  But each can alsobe known to users on the network by a more natural name-a file name, Unixpatch name, etc.andP;  Name servers, then, map these informal names to the systemidentifiers.andP;  The identifiers are independent of the name of die object'slocation, which makes it easy to move objects on the network.andM;OBJECT DIRECTORY AND OTHER SERVICES.andP;  Servers perform two of the three basicfunctions of the Network Computing Architecture: naming objects and locatingobjects.andP;  The NCS performs the other, invoking methods on objects.andM;Naming objects is the func don of the Name Server.andP;  There may be one or moreper network.andM;Locating objects is the function of the Location Broker.andP;  NCA assumes thepresence of a global location broker that knows the whereabouts of allobjects on the network.andP;  There may be more than one global location broker ifperformance or contention conditions require it.andP;  Apollo's Network ComputingSystem comes with standard locating classes.andP;  One class maintains indexedfiles.andP;  Another is die file system, which includes classes for opening andclosing files and for reading and writing bytes to files.andM;COMMUNICATIONS METHODS.andP;  Invoking methods on objects is the province of dieremote procedure call.andP;  It is Eke a pipe w carry messages invoking methods.andO;The messages themselves are another, as yet incomplete, layer in thisarchitecture.andP;  Apollo developers are defining protocols to activate anddeactivate objects, lock and unlock objects, start and end transactionsbetween objects, retrieve objects, and invoke methods on remote objects.andM;The activate/deactivate protocol will add a dimension to NCA that it lackstoday.andP;  Cuff enfly, NCA has no notion of objects that are not active.andP;  TheNCS remote procedure call mechanism can find a database server object, butdoesn't know how to activate a passive object held by it.andP;  NCA will continueto define some objects that are always active.andP;  Displays, printers, andE-mail servers are &quot;amples.andP;  OfficeVision :IBM's Object ViewandM;IBM's new OfficeVision product line introduces an objectoriented applicationsenvironment based on OS/2 Extended Edition.andP;  OfficeVision Release 1 isn't thefull environment.andP;  Rather, it sets the stage for the real McCoy, Release 2,by adding function to today's conventional E-mail packages.andP;  IBM's goal withRelease 1 is to introduce cooperative processing between LAN front ends andSAA hosts as well as some of the function in Release 2.andM;Release 1 provides direct manipulation of resources through a graphicalinterface, integration of applications and information, and data-sharing.andO;Release 2 provides an open desktop metaphor, Release 1 doesn't.andM;CONCEPTS: OBJECTS.andP;  OfficeVision data objects are the size of files andrecords.andP;  Data objects are datafiles associated with applications, or ObjectHandlers.andP;  A spreadsheet file containing the month's results in salesterritories can be associated with a spreadsheet as a data object.andO;Double-clicking on the objecteither an icon or a text listing-calls the fileand invokes the spreadsheet application.andP;  Moving past the stage when objectsare huge conglomerations of files and applications will take time, IBMasserts.andP;  Release 2 objects will be at the file and record level ofgranularity.andP;  The OfficeVision architecture win accommodate more extensiveuse of objects when that approach to writing software becomes prevalent.andM;In addition to data objects, OfficeVision defines container objects, whichstore other objects, and device objects, which process other objects.andO;OfficeVision's In-basket, File Cabinet, and Folders are containers; theOut-basket, Printer objects, Phone objec% and Scanners are device objects.andM;OBJECT REGISTRATION/MANAGEMENT.andP;  The Object Registration Service inOfficeVision manages connections between objects in die same way thatNewWave's OMF does.andP;  Shared objects are stored in a Registration Serviceresiding on a network server.andP;  (See illustration, page 9.) Initially, IBMwill develop Registration Service components for OS/2, followed by versionsfor VM, OS/400, and MVS over time.andP;  When the program is complete, an OS/2workstation will be able to request objects on any S AA hosts.andM;VIEW-DATA SEPARATION.andP;  Each OfficeVision object has two built-in instances,the acwal object and a view of the object.andP;  Users gain access to sharedobjects by either copying them into their local systems or by requestingviews of them.andP;  Users themselves will have some discretion over whether theycan access a view or an actual object, although IBM also plans to make thechoice context-sensitive.andP;  COMMUNICATIONS METHODS.andP;  Interactions betweenOfficeVision objects take place over LU6.2 sessions.andP;  IBM is designing theprotocols governing object interaction.andM;The data streams defined in MO: DCA will eventually allow robust interactionsbetween objects.andP;  If two objects support MO: DCA, they'll be able to carry ona rich interactionfor &quot;ample, passing a document with all of its formatting,with full manipulation capabilities on either end.andP;  Strangely, OfficeVisionRelease 2 does not support MO:DCA data streams.andP;  MO:DCA support is adevelopment direction for the productand the sooner the better.andM;OBJECT DIRECTORY AND OTHER SERVICES.andP;  At press time, IBM was still workingout die details of its network strategy for OfficeVision.andP;  By shipment time,the picture will be clear.andP;  Among the questions being addressed, says SandyCureton, manager of application integration, are: Should any OfficeVisionuser be allowed to register objects on a server, making them shared? Orshould only a LAN administrator be allowed to register shared objects?andM;Digital's NAS Enters an Object EraandM;Digital's Network Applications Support (NAS) is a set of application servicesthat provide distributed applications integration across multivendor systems.andO;NAS is an implementation of Digital's Application Integration Architecture.andO;Digital is applying object orientation to enhance its NAS applicationenvironment.andP;  Digital's goal with this environment is to provide a platformfor tailorable applications and advanced services like task automation atopVMS or Ultrix.andM;Today, NAS includes DECwindows, the Compound Document Architecture (CDA)toolkit and Convener Library, DECforms, GKS and PHIGS graphics support,Mailbus, SQL Services, and DECprint.andP;  Support for distributed objectmanagement-through something called Application Control Services (ACS) andCDA-is clearly part of Digital's plan, although it isn't there yet.andM;We can see object NAS taking shape in Digital's new DECdecision, adecision-support environment, and DECwrite, a compound document editor thatallows Live Links.andP;  These applications are based on DECwindows, ACS, and CDAservices.andP;  (See illustration to left.)andM;CONCEPTS: OBJECTS.andP;  Objects in NAS correspond to those found in theenvironments discussed earlier in this article.andM;OBJECT REGISTRATION/MANAGEMENT.andP;  The links between components in a compounddocument/object are currently provided by the Live Links feature of CDA.andO;Live Links are stored independently of the document/objec% and can bereferenced by applications other than the one that created diem, both locallyand across a network.andP;  Live Links also include an &quot;auto-update&quot; feature thatkeeps die documents/objects they define in sync with the latest version oftheir underlying data.andM;There are three kinds of Live Links: data finks connect a datafile to adocumentlobject, application finks give applicadons access todocuments/objects created by different applications, and script links areused to fink applications in a taskautomation series.andM;Live Links are currently encoded document by document.andP;  DECwrite, one ofDigital's new NAS -based applications, uses ACS and CDA to create Live Linksbetween the elements of a compound document.andP;  These Live Links are extendibleto the task automation feature of DECdecision, which is called Builder.andP;  Thisallows the result of a series of analysis tasks to be linked into a DECwritedocument.andM;Digital is studying die usefulness of a facility that would store arid trackthese links independent of the document they pertain to-something like theObject Management Facility in HP's NewWave.andP;  The Builder component inDECdecision is likely to be that facility.andP;  Builder today is specific toDECdecision, but Digital has signaled that it intends to make Builder ageneral facility available across applications.andP;  Builder already uses scriptlinks to automate tasks, and it provides the beginnings of a local repositoryof information about local objects.andP;  The next step for Digital is tostrengthen this repository and provide support for networked objects in itsApplication Control Services.andM;Access, another DECdecision facility, will also become a generalized serviceavailable to all NAS applications.andP;  Access allows users to tap multipledatabases, using object classes to mask the complexity of operations hkefetch, store, modify a record, and join.andP;  Together, Builder, Access, and LiveLinks will be added to a layer in NAS called Application Control Services.andM;VIEW-DATA SEPARATION.andP;  Digita1's CDA provides the means for presentations ofan object to be separated from the semantics, or content, of the objectitself.andP;  CDA allows for different views of the same content.andM;COMMUNICATIONS METHODS.andP;  Application Control Services (ACS) provides thepipes and protocols within DECnet for applications to talk and work together.andO;The tools themselves leverage the integration services.andP;  Digital providesselected services now, but more are likely to follow.andM;Now, for example, Builder uses DECwindows' Global Select feature to open apipeline between two applications.andP;  The two applications then interact, withthe target telling the source what form it can accept data in.andP;  Datainterchange ranges from low levels, like ASCII, to the intelligent level ofapplications supporting Digital's CDA.andM;CDA provides for interchange of richly encoded data, text, and graphics usingan object-oriented paradigm.andP;  CDA applications understand common data strewns(the DDIF and DTIF formats), and a sophisticated interchange between them cantake place.andP;  Alternatively, users can use the DECwindows clipboard to moveinformation between applications.andM;Digital can be expected to incorporate a remote procedure call mechanism-theresult of its work with Apollo Computer's Network Computing Services (NCS)-tothe range of options for object interaction.andP;  Other higherlevel ApplicationControl Services supporting application-to-application communications acrossa network are also likely, as well as a distributed global repository ofshared objects.andM;OBJECT DIRECTORY AND OTHER SERVICES.andP;  Digital can be expected to use an X.500directory to provide object directory services.andM;Unisys's ODA-Based StrategyandM;Unisys Corporation is working on a system w manage internation betweenobjects-documents, principally-on Unix-based distributed networks.andP;  Thestrategy, called the Document Management System (DMS) within Unisys,leverages three major standards: die Office Document Architecture (ODA) andits Office Document Interchange Format (ODIF), the X.500 directory standard,and Unix.andM;Unisys's goal is to use its DMS to manage interaction between documents andobjects created with a variety of thirdparty applications in the Unix, DOS,and OS/2 environments without requiring their modification or encapsulation.andO;Unlike HP's NewWave, which requires applications to be written to itsapplication programming interface or specially encapsulated, Unisys willaccommodate existing applications in its DMS and also provide an API foradvanced services.andM;Unisys was one of the founders of the Object Management Group, and willsubmit its work on DMS for consideration as the OMG begins to craftstandards.andP;  On its way to the standards window at OMG, Unisys will bump intoData General, Hewlett-Packard/Apollo, and 3Com, each of which is workingtoward the same goal.andM;CONCEPTS.andP;  Unisys's Document Management System is inherently a network-basedsystem.andP;  It includes mail and directory services, as well as interobjectcommunication protocols.andM;Unisys's Document Management System will run on Unix-based client-servernetworks.andP;  It will allow, however, integration of DOS and OS/2 clients.andP;  Userinterfaces will be implemented as front ends; the base system will include acharacterbased interface.andP;  OBJECTS: PROFILES.andP;  In DMA, objects are ODA&quot;profiles,&quot; containing information about their origin, location,characteristics, and behavior.andP;  These objects are very similar to the kind ofobjects managed by Data General's DAA and HP/Apollo's NewWave-NCA; they aredatafiles linked to particular applications.andP;  Compound objects can alsocontain other objects, and resources, like mail and printers, are alsodefined as objects.andM;OBJECT REGISTRATION/MANAGEMENT.andP;  Unisys is working on an object registrationfacility that is similar to NewWave's Object Management Facility.andP;  It createsand manages the links between elements of objects.andP;  DMA's facility willprovide an API for application developers to gain access to a graphicalinterface and advanced services.andP;  Applications written to the API will allowusers to directly manipulate objects by maneuvering icons on a screen, forexample.andM;But DMA will also recognize objects incorporating applications that are notwritten to its API.andP;  Users can register profile information about theseobjects with the facility using a menubased interface.andP;  These objects will bevisible to users, but won't participate in the services Unisys offers in itsenvironment.andP;  For example, they won't be directly manipulable by users.andP;  Andshould Unisys layer a task automation facility over its object facility,these objects won't be able to use it.andM;VIEW-DATA SEPARATION.andP;  DMA will feature the same basic view-data separationas the other distributed object management environments discussed in thisarticle.andP;  Unisys is working on the protocols to govern the relationshipsbetween views and their underlying data objects.andP;  COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.andO;Unisys's system can be viewed as an object filing system that resides abovethe native Unix, DOS, or OS/2 file system.andP;  Users will have access to thenative file system from within Unisys's en vironment.andP;  DMA will use Unixservers and three different transports.andP;  Novell's NetWare, with PortableNetWare servers, will support DOS clients.andP;  LAN Manager is the transport forOS/2 workstations, and LAN Man ager for Unix and LM/X servers will supportUnix clients.andM;Unisys is working with a third party on a network-portable remote procedurecall mechanism for DMA.andP;  The goal is an RPC for a variety of environments,including NetWare and OS/2.andM;Unisys will need protocols like Data General's AAP and SAP to allow objectsto interact on networks.andP;  Developers are working on these, although the workis in its formative stages.andP;  Indeed, Unisys's primary interest in the ObjectManagement Group is the potential for defining consensus protocols from amongthe hundreds of potential commands that could govern interaction betweenobjects.andP;  ODA AND ODIF.andP;  The environment is based on ODA's ODIF with Unisysextensions.andP;  The extensions give ODIF the additional definitions Unisys needsto make it a vehicle for object interaction.andP;  ODIF defines much of theprofile information Unisys needs in its system already-it recognizesimages-and it is a neutral &quot;standard&quot; platform.andP;  ODA also provides amechanism for hot links between objects.andM;Unisys's extensions to ODIF will encompass data ems like spreadsheets, whicharen't recognized by ODIF.andM;OBJECT DIRECTORY AND OTHER SERVICES.andP;  Unisys Document Management System willeventually use an X.500 directory service to manage object profiles, registerthe names of objects, and keep track of copies and revisions.andP;  The directoryservice will also store user information,andM;The system will also use Unisys's existing electronic mail system to sendobjects around the network.andP;  Interaction with the mail system will be via asimple user interface.andM;3Com's Object Management PlatformandM;The main thrust of 3Com's efforts in networked objects is defining directoryand network object management services built on an X.500 directory.andP;  3Com isalso defining protocols that will allow objects to interact across networks,3Com's work will be presented to the OMG, says Bob Bressler.andP;  But 3Com'sprimary motivation for joining OMG was not to pitch its technology.andP;  Rather,Bressler hopes that distributed object management will make networks easierto use, and thus, easier to sell.andM;CONCEPTS: DIRECTORY SERVICES.andP;  In distributed object management, directoriesmust be much more than are those found on today's electronic mail networks.andO;They must be repositories of information about network objects-resources likeprinters and Email, as well as shared functional objects.andP;  In 3Com's vision,directories provide an interface and tools to model network information and adatabase with a query facility.andM;3Com's directory will be a repository of information about the objects on thenetwork and their relationships toother objects.andP;  It will be implemented,according to the X.500 standard, as a specialized hierarchical database withits own query language.andP;  This repository, in tum, will provide a base fornetwork management services.andM;Following the X.500 model, 3Com's directory will be fully distributed andreplicatable.andP;  X.500 does not define replication mechanisms, so 3Com willprovide its own extension to the standard to provide this capability.andM;From a functional standpoint, object directories help make network operationsinvisible to users.andP;  Imagine a word processing application configured as atext editor residing on a workstation and a spelling checker residing on aserver.andP;  Ideally, the user will want to toss documents against the spellingchecker without knowing or caring where it is on the network.andP;  This requiresdirectories, naming services, and a mechanism for passing calls between thetext editor and die spelling checker.andM;From an administrative standpoint, directory services are the key to managingdie network.andP;  They provide a window into network operations.andM;DISTRIBUTION OF DIRECTORIES.andP;  The X.500 standard governs the way directorieshold information about what die other directories are holding.andP;  What'smissing is a protocol that allows systems to synchronize and hold up-to-datecopies of information.andP;  3Com is working on filling this gap in its directorywith a protocol and methods for object storage.andP;  The strategy calls forperiodic complete resynchronization of directories and broadcasts from onedirectory to others on the network after updates.andP;  The scheme is similar toconcurrency control in a  database.andM;GLOBAL REPOSITORY.andP;  3Com's distributed depository will allow userorganizations to set up global repositories of network information.andP;  Giventhe 3Com directory's capabilities, this becomes strictly an implementationchoice.andM;DIRECTORY SERVICES.andP;  Object registration is accomplished through a networkmanagement application or via a user facility.andP;  Typically, networkadministrators will be responsible for adding, say, printers to the networkand registering them with the directory.andP;  Users will be able to add objectsto the directory's database and specify its access level.andM;Alternatively, a network administrator can switch over to a dynamic mode,which automates some network chores, If, for example, the directory can getthe information it needs from a printer automatically, that printer can beadded and configured without the administrator's intervention.andM;The Role of E-MailandM;Current development efforts in distributed object management focus onso-called synchronous object interaction.andP;  That is, objects sending messagesasking other objects to execute methods expect those methods to be carriedout immediately.andP;  There's also a place for &quot;asynchronous&quot; object interaction,and, in this realm, electronic mail holds strong potential.andM;In distributed object management systems like the ones discussed above, mailis a way of transmitting documents.andP;  But what about the potential of mail forcarrying messages between objects? These messages would invoke methods thatdidn't require an immediate response, nor, perhaps, any response at all.andM;THE OPPORTUNITIES: EDI.andP;  Consider an electronic data interchange application,for example.andP;  XYZ Corporation's inventory object, responding to a low-supplycondition, tells an agent to order 10,000 Type B bolts for delivery in twoweeks from supplier QRS Corporation.andP;  The agent passes the message to the neworder object at QRS Corporation, which updates the scheduling object, and soforth.andP;  There may not be a reply to XYZ Corporation's agent; it could travelthrough E-mail.andP;  Possibly a &quot;message received&quot; reply would be necessary.andM;This kind of interaction between objects is very different than the kinddiscussed in the examples above.andP;  E-mail can be a store-and-forward mechanismfor objects to conduct their work over.andP;  In fact, E-mail and asynchronousdistributed object management represent a future enhancement of thetechnology.andM;The likely evolution of the technology is to use E-mail to transport objectsfrom one system to another.andP;  This capability has been implemented by MetaphorComputer Systems Incorporated in its Data Interpretation System, for example,Users can send application &quot;capsules,&quot; which are like objects, to oneanother.andM;The next step would be to provide object directory services in E-mailnetworks to help route objects.andP;  Directory services would also aid in networkmanagement.andP;  The next enhancement would be to use E-mail to transport objectsbetween heterogeneous, incompatible environments.andP;  In this case, E-mail wouldprovide the necessary transformations of objects.andP;  Finally, we wiU arrive atapplications like the one discussed in the EDI example above.andM;Soft-Switch Incorporated has suggested three designs for incorporatingelectronic mail into object networks.andP;  (See illustration, page 13.) Eachscenario assumes several advances from today's technology.andP;  First,corporations will need backbone mail networks linking the variety of systemsin their inventories.andP;  Second, we'll need better-defined programminginterfaces to mail servers-hke those taking shape in the P3/P7 X.400 protocolboundary for application connectivity.andP;  Last, we'll need naming and locationservices on our backbone mail networks.andM;ConclusionandM;Distributed object management is taking shape now.andP;  IBM, Digital, andHP/Apollo have recognized its values within their worlds, and they areputting in place the pieces to implement it by next year.andP;  Data General andUnisys are defining systems that promise to leverage open standards beforeIBM, Digital, and HP do.andP;  And vendors like 3Com wiU certainly help to roundout these environments with management support.andM;As these vendors push their products, the Object Management Group has begundiscussing where they should all come together.andP;  Call this standards-making,call it implementors' agreements-it adds up to the same thing.andP;  There's aforum and a framework in place to begin working out how objects fromdifferent vendors will play in an overall distributed object managementenvironment.andM;One of the most surprising aspects of this field is its youth.andP;  As notedearlier, this is virgin turf.andP;  Data General has taken the bold step ofselecting, from the hundreds of possible commands, four that comprise aprotocol for network object interaction.andP;  Will the OMG members go along withthis? Will there be &quot;tensions? We'll learn these answers soon.andM;Users can and should play a role in helping to define this environment.andP;  Notethat American Airlines has joined the OMG.andP;  Membership is open.andP;  Barringparticipation in OMG, users should get started now in understanding howdistributed object management can make network computing more functional yeteasier to use in their corporations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
