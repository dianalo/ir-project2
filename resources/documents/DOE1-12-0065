The fluorescence was excited with a BSV-11 Mo tube. The contentsof Rh, Pd, and Cd were determined with the white spectrum of energy 30-40keV. It is also possible to analyze for Zn and Pt with this excitation.However, to improve the sensitivity and reduce the errors in determiningplatinum, they used the characteristic radiation from the tube anode.In analyzing for elements lighter than nickel, it is necessary to employexcitation from a secondary nickel target. The sensitivity in that elementrange is determined mainly by the performance of the x-ray detector.The authors used the K{alpha} lines of all the elements apart from zincand platinum, for which they used the K{beta}and L{beta}lines correspondingly,while in the analysis for zinc, it is necessary to correct for the overlapbetween the K{beta}line of zinc and L{sup 1} of platinum.</TEXT></DOC>
