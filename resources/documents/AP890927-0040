(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An elderly PTL contributor called JimBakker the most underpaid man in America, while a judge tiring of aseries of character witnesses asked defense attorneys to wrap uptheir case.   Marjorie Grey, who bought 32 of the $1,000 ``lifetimepartnerships'' at PTL, testified in Bakker's fraud trial that shewould gladly give money to the ministry again. However, hertestimony was later disallowed because she had attended earliersessions of the trial.   ``I'd do it all over again,'' the 74-year-old Ms. Grey said.``I'm interested in seeing that PTL is not taken away from us. JimBakker is one of the best people I've ever known.''   Ms. Grey was one of four satisfied PTL partners to testifyTuesday. The PTL founder's attorneys have presented 34 witnesses _most of them faithful contributors or former Bakker employees.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter called the number of characterwitnesses ``ridiculous,'' and told defense attorney Harold Bender:``We'll go on a little longer, but I'm getting tired of it. I thinkthe jury is, too, but it's up to you.''   Bender said the defense could conclude its case Friday.   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers by diverting more than$3.7 million in PTL money to fund a lavish lifestyle. He could besentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5 million ifconvicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.   In her testimony, Ms. Grey said she never had difficulty usingher partnerships, which gave her the right to annual stays at theHeritage USA religious theme park.   Prosecutors contend the partnerships that were sold greatlyoutnumbered those available. Prosecution witnesses had testifiedthey had trouble getting reservations.   Under cross-examination, Ms. Grey said she did not mind thatsome of the partnership money would go for bonuses to Bakker.   ``Oprah Winfrey gets $32 million for one TV show. He's the mostgrossly underpaid man in America today,'' she said of Bakker.   Also testifying Tuesday was Iva Mae Gravenar, who bought threelifetime partnerships. She also said she never had a problemgetting a room at Heritage USA.   ``Mr. Bakker didn't promise anything he didn't deliver,'' saidMs. Gravenar, of Salisbury, Md. ``Everything he said he was goingto give us, he gave us.''   Much of PTL's former theme park at Fort Mill, S.C., has beenclosed permanently. Hurricane Hugo knocked out electricity andphones at the Heritage USA park, hastening the closing, said M.C.Benton, the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the property.   In Orlando, Fla., Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, said the hurricanewas an example of God's wrath.   ``I said I believe the storm hitting Charlotte was a warning toCharlotte,'' Mrs. Bakker said in a telephone interview. ``I said ithad nothing to do with Jim and Tammy Bakker, but it did have to dowith the way the people in Charlotte, North Carolina, have treatedGod's people.''</TEXT></DOC>
