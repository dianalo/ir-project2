All input quantities for the computercode are treated as stochastic quantities. The measured results of theSalt Block II experiment are within the range of the SPECTROM-58 computedresults. However, the range of calculated results that arises from theuncertainty in the input quantities is so large that an evaluation ofthe aptness of SPECTROM-58 is precluded. The current uncertainty in severalof the input parameters must be reduced through laboratory testing beforethe Salt Block II experiment can be used for validating SPECTROM-58.29 refs., 22 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
