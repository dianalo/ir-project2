flowable material for use in applications where it      is desirable to reinitialize the padding device for subsequent use in      absorbing and/or distributing impact forces. One application for which the      padding device is particularly well suited is as a foot padding device in      footwear. In this application, the device provides improved absorption and      distribution of impact forces generated when the footwear contacts a      surface, as well as improved lateral support for the foot. In a preferred      embodiment, a primary chamber is positioned under the area to be padded,      and a plurality of secondary chambers, each fluidly connected to the      primary chamber, are positioned around the padded area. The impact force      of the user's foot deforms the primary chamber, thereby forcing some of      the flowable material contained therein to flow into the secondary      chambers. The rate of deformation of the primary chamber exceeds the flow      rate into the secondary chambers, thereby providing a cushioning effect.      When the portion of the footwear coinciding with the primary chamber loses      contact with the ground, the force is removed from the primary chamber,      thereby allowing the secondary chambers to contract and force some of the      flowable materials contained therein back into the primary chamber to      reinitialize the padding device. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates generally to the field of padding devices, and more      particularly, to chambered padding devices which are used to at least      partially absorb and/or distribute forces and which are      self-reinitializing after removal of at least a portion of the force for      subsequent use. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  A number of padding devices to relieve impact forces are known. For      example, walking, jogging, and running generate large forces which are      transferred throughout the body to such stress-sensitive areas as the knee      and hip joints, as well as the lower back, where they then must be      absorbed by the body. However, the origin of impact is the feet, and      although quite possibly not as stress-sensitive as the above identified      regions, the pressures experienced by the feet are magnified by the impact      forces being applied over a relatively small area, typically the ball and      heel of the foot. Consequently, there have been numerous attempts to not      only reduce the overall stress imposed upon the body, but to also reduce      the level of discomfort often experienced by the feet, all by utilizing      impact absorbing devices in footwear. </PAR><PAR>  Foam cushions are commonly used in footwear and other articles of clothing      for absorbing impact force and can either be built into the footwear or be      separately insertable. The basic concept of utilizing extra foam      cushioning is that some of the forces of impact will be dissipated or      absorbed in compressing the foam cushion. When the force is removed, the      foam cushion will theoretically expand, in essence reinitializing itself      for repeated absorbtion of impact forces. </PAR><PAR>  There are a wide variety of foams available which have different properties      and characteristics. However, foams in general have numerous inherent      deficiencies which adversely affect their performance as impact force      absorbers. For instance, &quot;soft&quot; foams offer little or no protection and      dissipate little if any of the energy transferred at impact since they are      easily compressed, and in fact tend to bottom out (fully compress) when      subjected to a large force. &quot;Harder&quot; foams, on the other hand, may      dissipate more energy by having a higher resistance to compression, but      such pads will tend to adversely affect the comfort experienced by the      user since there will not be much &quot;give&quot; in the pad, resulting in the      impact forces being transferred to the body. </PAR><PAR>  Regardless of the type of foam used as an impact force absorber, there may      also be problems with an undesirable increase in the weight, for example,      of the shoe in which the pad is used. Moreover, the lateral stability      offered by the footwear by use of the additional foam pad may deteriorate      since the distance from the ground to the bottom of the foot will quite      naturally increase, thereby increasing the possibility of a user injuring      an ankle or knee. Furthermore, a natural inherent characteristic of most      foams is that over a given number of cycles of compression and expansion,      the resiliency will eventually be affected such that the foam will become      fatigued and no longer absorb impact forces as effectively as a foam which      has not experienced cyclic fatigue. </PAR><PAR>  Because of these types of undesirable characteristics exhibited by foam      materials, numerous alternatives for absorbing impact forces have been      developed. Instead of using foams as the impact absorbing medium, gases      such as air and various liquids have been incorporated into certain      configurations to enhance the impact absorbtion and distribution      characteristics provided, for example, by footwear padding devices. Some      of these alternative methods and devices will be discussed in the      following paragraphs. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,728 by Frecentese, issued Apr. 28, 1981, discloses a      jogging shoe with an adjustable shock absorbing system. The shock      absorbing system includes a plurality of inwardly compressible piston-like      protrusions on the bottom of the sole which communicate with a single air      chamber contained within the sole of the shoe. The air chamber is inflated      to an initial pressure by means of a valve which accesses the air chamber      from outside the sole of the shoe. In operation, as a person walks, jogs,      or runs, the pistonlike protrusions on the bottom of the sole of the shoe      individually compress as they contact the ground. This compression of the      pistons compresses the air contained within the air chamber which results      in the absorbtion and distribution of the impact forces. Although      Frecentese discloses a shock absorbing system for footwear, the disclosure      is restricted to using air in a single chamber as the shock absorbing      medium. Moreover, the disclosure of Frecentese is restricted to a system      which is constructed within the sole of the shoe. Consequently, if the      shock absorbing system fails, presumably the entire shoe would have to be      replaced. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,342,157 by Gilbert, issued Aug. 3, 1982, discloses a shock      absorbing system made up of two independent cushions which are both filled      with a liquid and a gas, the liquid occupying a majority of the volume of      the cushion. These cushions are constructed within the sole of a shoe and      are preferably placed in those portions of the shoe coinciding with the      heel and ball areas of the foot. The apparent shock absorbing concept      desired by Gilbert is simply providing compressible cushions to protect      these areas of the foot, the cushions merely being a liquid/gas      combination rather than a foam. Although disclosing the use of      liquid/gas-filled cushions in footwear, there is no disclosure or      suggestion of using any fluid communication between the chambers as a way      to absorb and/or distribute impact forces. Furthermore, the disclosure      requires that the cushions be constructed within the sole of the shoe.      Consequently, if the cushions rupture, the entire shoe would presumably      have to be replaced. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,217,705 by Donzis, issued Aug. 19, 1980, discloses a      flexible, self-contained, fluid-filled support device for use in footwear.      The support device is an insertable cushion which approximates the contour      of a foot. The cushion is formed by sealing two plies of material on the      periphery and then sealing numerous portions of the cushion interior of      the periphery to form a plurality of interconnected chambers. Fluid      communication between the chambers is limited to a path around the      periphery and is further restricted when the cushion is flexed, which in      essence pinches off the flow channels to effectively create a plurality of      isolated chambers. Therefore, impact forces are absorbed by deformation of      the cushion without utilizing a substantial transfer of fluid to lower      pressure regions of the cushion to more effectively absorb and/or      distribute impact forces. Moreover, there is no disclosure or suggestion      that the individual chambers are capable of a self-pumping action to      transfer fluid throughout the pad, instead requiring the application of a      force thereon to transfer a limited amount of fluid to other regions of      the pad. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,538,902 by Cole et al., issued Nov. 16, 1982, discloses a      shock absorbing system having interconnected, fluid-filled chambers which      are partially constructed within the sole of the shoe. Although a majority      of the chambers are contained within the sole, a portion of each cushion      extends beneath the sole and thus actually comes into contact with the      ground. One embodiment suggests positioning one chamber to coincide with      the heel and two chambers to coincide with the ball area of the foot, the      heel chamber being fluidly communicable with the two ball area chambers.      The shock absorbing function disclosed by Cole et al. begins with the heel      impacting the heel chamber. This impact deforms the heel chamber and      forces some of the fluid contained therein to flow into the two ball area      chambers. When the ball area chambers strike the ground, these chambers      deform and some of the fluid contained therein is forced to flow back into      the heel chamber. Consequently, fluid is transferred from front to back to      absorb and distribute the impact forces. Although disclosing an      interconnected, multi-chambered, fluid-filled shock absorbing system, Cole      et al. do not disclose or suggest that any of the chambers themselves      exhibit a self-pumping action, instead requiring the application of a      force to transfer fluid to the other chamber or chambers. Moreover, the      disclosure is restricted to a system which is constructed within the sole      of the shoe. Furthermore, Cole et al. do not disclose or suggest providing      for improved lateral support by using chambers in the shoe which are      positioned around the periphery of the foot or a portion thereof. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,430 by Peterson, issued Jul. 10, 1984, discloses a      shock absorbing system constructed within the sole of a shoe consisting of      two interconnected, fluid-filled chambers. The chambers are positioned      under the heel and arch portions of the foot. Unlike the assembly      disclosed in Cole et al. above, the chambers are totally contained within      the sole of the shoe, i.e., the chambers do not bulge below the sole of      the shoe. The impact absorbing function initiates when the heel strikes      the rear chamber and the fluid contained therein is forced to flow into      the other chamber, causing it to expand. The chambers, however, provide a      certain resistance to expansion. This, coupled with the somewhat      restricted connecting passageways, serves to absorb some of the impact      forces. The process is reversed when the forward cushion experiences an      applied force. Although Peterson discloses a multi-chambered, fluidly      connected impact absorbing device, the disclosure of Peterson is      restricted to a system which is constructed within the shoe. A further      problem with the systems disclosed by both Peterson and Cole et al. is      that they provide no impact absorption if both chambers are compressed      simultaneously as presumably would happen when one jumps straight up and      down. Moreover, Peterson does not disclose or suggest providing improved      lateral support by placing chambers in the shoe around the periphery of      the foot or a portion thereof. Furthermore, Peterson does not disclose or      suggest that some of the chambers exhibit self-pumping characteristics,      instead requiring the application of a force to a chamber to transfer      fluid to the other chamber. </PAR><PAR>  In summary, the above-discussed padding devices for footwear which use a      fluid medium to absorb and/or distribute impact forces are inadequate in a      number of respects. Initially, many of the references disclose devices      which are built into the sole of the footwear. When any portion of the      shock absorbing system malfunctions or wears out, the entire shoe      presumably must be replaced. In addition, none of the references appear to      disclose improving the lateral support of the shoe by positioning a      chamber or chambers around the periphery of the foot or a portion thereof.      Furthermore, all of the references which implement interconnected,      multi-chambered shock absorbing systems require that a force be exerted on      or near the chambers themselves to move fluid to lower pressure regions.      Therefore, if forces are not alternatively applied to each chamber in a      precisely timed manner, they will not function effectively. </PAR><PAR>  It would be advantageous to have a padding device which overcomes the      deficiencies of known devices, namely by providing a padding device which      uses fluidly communicable chambers to effectively and efficiently absorb      and distribute impact forces, and which is self reinitializing for      subsequent use. It would also be advantageous to provide a device which      improves the lateral support of footwear for applications where such a      feature would be appropriate. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention, a self-reinitializing padding      device is provided which utilizes fluidly interconnected chambers      containing flowable material to at least partially absorb and/or      distribute forces. This self-reinitializing feature allows the present      invention to be used in a wide variety of applications. The preferred      application is for protecting the foot or portions thereof since this      particular area is subjected to cyclic type forces during walking,      jogging, or running, thereby requiring a padding device capable of rapid      reinitialization to offer adequate protection. However,      self-reinitialization of padding devices is also desirable in applications      where the force is more random, but still repeated. For instance, the      present invention may be used to protect any region of the body, such as      the elbow, hand, or knee which often experience a force when engaged in      various activities. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is a primary      chamber which contains or is capable of containing flowable material.      Positioned radially outwardly from the primary chamber are a plurality of      secondary chambers which are individually connected to the primary chamber      and which also contain or are capable of containing flowable material. The      secondary chambers do not necessarily have to be positioned equidistant      from the main chamber, but instead may be positioned to coincide with the      perimeter of the region to be protected, for instance the heel in the foot      pad application. In order to accommodate variations in distance from the      primary chamber, the channels connecting the primary chamber to each of      the secondary chambers will vary in length and cross-sectional area. The      channels connecting secondary chambers which are closer to the primary      chamber are shorter and have smaller cross-sectional areas than those      which are located farther away from the primary chamber. This allows each      secondary chamber to expand and contract at substantially the same rate as      a result of intaking and exhausting flowable materials, as will be      discussed below. The primary chamber, secondary chambers, and the      connecting channels forming the padding device each are capable of      containing flowable material, and at least one of these elements will      always contain flowable material throughout operation of the padding      device. </PAR><PAR>  In another embodiment of the present invention there is a single,      substantially tubular secondary chamber located radially outwardly from,      and fluidly connected with, a primary chamber, the secondary chamber again      being positionable to coincide with the perimeter of the object to be      protected, for instance the heel in the foot pad application.      Consequently, as above, all points on the secondary chamber may not      necessarily be equidistant from the primary chamber. The plurality of      interconnecting channels which connect various portions of the secondary      chamber to the primary chamber thus may vary length and cross-sectional      area for the same reasons discussed above. The primary chamber, secondary      chamber, and the connecting channels forming the padding device are each      capable of containing flowable material, and at least one of these      elements will contain flowable material throughout operation of the      padding device. </PAR><PAR>  The padding device of the present invention absorbs and/or distributes      impact forces in a similar manner, regardless of the application for which      it is being used. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity, the following      description will focus on just one of the many applications of the padding      devices, that being when it is used as a foot pad. When the padding device      is used in a footwear application, as a foot pad, either being built      within the footwear or being separately insertable therewithin, the      primary chamber is positioned to coincide with a certain portion of the      foot, most commonly the heel. When the heel of the footwear strikes the      ground, the user's heel deforms the primary chamber which forces some of      the flowable material contained therein to flow to the secondary chambers.      Total instantaneous deformation of the primary chamber, i.e., bottoming      out, is prevented by the restrictive nature of the channels connecting the      primary chamber and the secondary chambers. The rate of deformation of the      primary chamber is thus greater than the rate of transfer of flowable      materials to the secondary chambers through the channels. Consequently,      the channels provide back-pressure to the primary chamber which aids in      the absorbtion of some of the impact forces. Moreover, the energy required      to transfer the flowable materials to the secondary chambers dissipates      some of the energy transferred at impact, as does the stretching of the      secondary chambers as they receive flowable materials from the primary      chamber. </PAR><PAR>  Not only are some of the impact forces absorbed as described, but such      forces are also distributed to the outer portions of the heel by the      transfer of flowable materials from the primary chamber to each of the      secondary chambers where such forces are then absorbed by the outer      portions of the heel. The secondary chambers in their expanded state also      provide improved lateral support since they will in essence form a barrier      around the perimeter of the heel. </PAR><PAR>  The materials forming the secondary chambers must allow the secondary      chambers to exhibit self-pumping characteristics--that is, allow the      secondary chambers to exhaust a certain volume of flowable material back      to the primary chamber after the force or a portion thereof is removed      from the primary chamber, without requiring the application of an external      force to such secondary chambers. Consequently, since such materials are      used in the present invention, when the force of the heel is removed from      the primary chamber the secondary chambers act like self contained pumps      and contract, having been stretched beyond their maximum unstressed      volumetric capacity, and force at least some of the flowable material      contained therein to flow back into the primary chamber to reinitialize      the system for subsequent impact force absorbtion/distribution functions. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a top view of one embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the padding device of FIG. 1 taken      along line II--II of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a top view of another embodiment of the present invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the padding device of FIG. 3 taken      along line IV--IV of FIG. 3. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention will be described with reference to the attached      figures which illustrate one configuration of the present invention. As      previously discussed, the preferred application of the present invention      is as a foot pad. Due to the cyclic nature of the application of forces to      a foot, the self-reinitialization feature of the present invention is      highly desirable when the pad is employed in footwear. However,      applications where random, but still repeated, forces are experienced will      also benefit from use of the present invention and its self-reinitializing      feature. Such applications include those where protection is desired of a      bone protuberant area, as well as other sensitive areas such as the elbow,      hand, and knee, which commonly need protection when engaging in certain      activities, including various sports. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 1 and 2 are a top and cross-sectional view taken along line II--II of      FIG. 1, respectively, of a preferred embodiment of the present invention.      Padding device 10 is an enclosure formed by joining elastic material 20 to      backing material 30. Backing material 30 may be either an elastic or      nonelastic material. Elastic material 20 is sealed to backing material 30      in a configuration having a primary chamber 40, a plurality of secondary      chambers 50 which are located radially outwardly from primary chamber 40      and which are positioned to coincide with the perimeter of the object to      be protected, e.g., a heel in the foot padding device application. In this      regard, the primary chamber 40 includes a front portion 42, two laterally      displaced side portions 44, and a rear portion 46 which is longitudinally      displaced from the front portion 42. Consequently, in the embodiment      illustrated in FIG. 1, the secondary chambers 50 are positioned outwardly      from the two side portions 44 and the rear portion 46 of the primary      chamber 40. More particularly, at least a portion of one of the secondary      chambers 50 is positioned outwardly from each of the side portions 44 at a      location which is longitudinally between the front and rear portions 42,      46. </PAR><PAR>  Also included in padding device 10 are a plurality of connecting channels      60 connecting each secondary chamber 50 to primary chamber 40. At least      one of primary chamber 40, secondary chambers 50, and connecting channels      60 will contain flowable material, which acts as the medium for absorbing      and distributing impact forces, throughout the operation of padding device      10. Each of these elements and their placement in the configuration will      be discussed in more detail below to illustrate the attendant advantages      of the present invention, namely a padding device which is      self-reinitializing and which offers improved force absorbtion and      distribution characteristics. Further, in appropriate applications such as      when the padding device of the present invention is used to protect the      foot, it also offers improved lateral support. </PAR><PAR>  Padding device 10 is an enclosure formed by sealing elastic material 20 to      backing material 30 in the desired configuration, namely primary chamber      40, secondary chambers 50, and connecting channels 60. Elastic material 20      can be any pliable, lightweight material which has a certain degree of      elasticity, as well as a high resistance to puncturing. As will be      discussed in more detail below regarding the interaction of the elements      of padding device 10, elastic material 20 is specifically needed in order      for secondary chambers 50 to be able to pump flowable materials back into      primary chamber 40 without requiring the exertion of a force on secondary      chambers 50 (i.e., the device is self-reinitializing). Examples of      materials which are suitable for elastic material 20 include polyurethane      or polyvinyl (e.g. polyvinylchloride) materials, acetals; acrylics;      cellulosics; chlorinated polyethers; fluorocarbons, such as      polytetrafluorethylene (TFE), polychlorotrifluoro-ethylene (CTEE), and      fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP); nylons (polyamides); polycarbonates;      polyethylenes (including copolymers); polybutylenes; polypropylenes;      polystyrenes; polyesters; and polysulfones; the preferred material being      polyurethane. Depending on the resistance to puncturing of the particular      material selected, the thickness of elastic material 20 will typically      range from about 0.1 millimeters to about 0.5 millimeters. </PAR><PAR>  Backing material 30 may be any pliable, lightweight material which is      either elastic or nonelastic and which has a high resistance to      puncturing. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, backing material      30 will be a pliable, lightweight, substantially nonelastic material such      as urethane laminate, the preferred material being a nylon reinforced      urethane. However, backing material 30 can also be elastic and exhibit the      same or similar characteristics as those materials identified as being      suitable for elastic material 20. Again, depending upon the resistance to      puncturing of the selected material, the thickness of backing material 30      will typically range from about 0.1 millimeters to about 0.5 millimeters. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIGS. 1      and 2, primary chamber 40 is substantially centrally located on padding      device 10. However, primary chamber 40 can be positioned anywhere on      padding device 10 to accommodate the cushioning of any desired object or      portion of the human anatomy. Primary chamber 40 is shown as being      semi-circular in shape, the semi-circle being closed on the forward      portion of padding device 10 by a line which connects two points on the      semi-circle. The radius of the semi-circular portion of primary chamber 40      in the foot pad application will generally range from about 20 millimeters      to about 40 millimeters. Primary chamber 40 is capable of containing      flowable material and will generally have an amount of flowable material,      when not being subjected to an applied force, occupying about 50 to about      100 percent of the volume of primary chamber 40. Primary chamber 40 will      have a thickness generally ranging from about 2 millimeters to about 10      millimeters when containing this volume of flowable material. Although      primary chamber 40 has been described in detail as to the shape and      dimensions thereof as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, it is to be expressly      recognized that the size and shape of primary chamber 40 can be modified      to accommodate protection of any object for which padding is desired,      i.e., the configuration may be tailored to the desired use. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2,      secondary chambers 50 are located radially outwardly from primary chamber      40 and are positioned to coincide with the perimeter of the object to be      protected, in this case the heel of a foot. In this particular application      (foot pad) all secondary chambers 50 are not equidistant from primary      chamber 40. Each secondary chamber 50 is substantially circular in shape,      having a diameter typically ranging from about 5 millimeters to about 30      millimeters. Secondary chambers 50 are capable of containing flowable      material and when at their maximum volume, generally 100% of the volume of      such secondary chambers 50 will be occupied by such flowable materials.      When at their normal maximum volume, such as when a force has been fully      applied to primary chamber 40, secondary chambers 50 will have a thickness      ranging from about 2 millimeters to about 10 millimeters. However, it is      to be understood that not all secondary chambers 50 will contain the same      amount of flowable material at all times due to the placement of the force      on primary chamber 40, i.e., an off-center placement of a force on primary      chamber 40 generally will cause more flowable materials to flow into those      secondary chambers 50 nearest the application of such force. Although the      preferred embodiment of secondary chambers 50 have been described as      having such shape and dimensions, it is to be expressly recognized that      any shape and dimension of secondary chambers 50 can be utilized.      Moreover, the placement of secondary chambers 50 will depend upon the      particular application with which padding device 10 is being used,      particularly the shape of the region to be protected. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in FIGS. 1 and      2, connecting channels 60 connect each secondary chamber 50 to primary      chamber 40. The connecting channels 60 are not necessarily the same      length, since secondary chambers 50 do not have to be equidistant from      primary chamber 40. The cross-sectional area of connecting channels 60      depends on the distance between the particular secondary chamber 50 and      the primary chamber 40. Secondary chambers 50 that are closer to primary      chamber 40 will have connecting channels 60 that are shorter and a      cross-sectional area which is smaller than those connecting channels 60      which connect secondary chambers 50 which are located farther away from      primary chamber 40. This is to ensure that each secondary chamber 50      expands and contracts at substantially the same rate when a force has been      centrally applied to primary chamber 40. In the preferred embodiment of      the present invention, the cross-sectional diameter of connecting channels      60 will range from about 1 millimeter to about 15 millimeters. Channels 60      are also capable of containing flowable material and will generally have      100 percent of their volume occupied when a force is being applied to      primary chamber 40. </PAR><PAR>  Another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 3 and      4, FIG. 3 being a top view of padding device 70 and FIG. 4 being a      cross-sectional view of FIG. 3 taken along line IV--IV. Padding device 70      is an enclosure formed by joining elastic material 80 to backing material      90, both of which have characteristics similar to elastic material and      backing material 30 in the preferred embodiment discussed above. Elastic      material 80 is sealed to backing material 90 in a configuration having a      primary chamber 100, having a front portion 102, two laterally displaced      side portions 104, and a rear portion 106 longitudinally displaced from      the front portion 102, secondary chamber 110, and a plurality of      connecting channels 120 connecting secondary chamber 110 to primary      chamber 100 in a plurality of locations. At least one of primary chamber      100, secondary chamber 110, and connecting channels 120 will contain      flowable material, which acts as the shock absorbing and distributing      medium, throughout the operation of padding device 70. Each of these      elements and their positioning in the configuration will be discussed in      more detail below to better illustrate the attendant advantages of the      present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Padding device 70 is an enclosure formed by sealing elastic material 80 to      backing material 90 in the desired configuration, namely primary chamber      100, secondary chamber 110, and connecting channels 120. Elastic material      80, backing material 90, primary chamber 100, and connecting channels 120      all have the same or similar features, characteristics, and positioning in      the configuration as the corresponding elements of the preferred      embodiment. However, secondary chamber 110 in this embodiment differs from      secondary chambers 50 of the preferred embodiment in certain respects. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4,      secondary chamber 110 is a single enclosure which is positioned radially      outwardly from primary chamber 100 to coincide with the perimeter of the      object to be protected. In this regard, at least a portion of the      secondary chamber 110 is positioned outwardly from the two side portions      104 of the primary chamber 100 at a location which is longitudinally      between the front and rear portions 102, 106 of the primary chamber 100,      with portions of the secondary chamber 110 also being positioned outwardly      from the rear portion 106 of the primary chamber 100. All points on      secondary chamber 110 need not necessarily be equidistant from primary      chamber 100. Consequently, connecting channels 120 may have varying      lengths and cross-sectional areas similar to connecting channels 60 in the      preferred embodiment. Secondary chamber 110 is somewhat tubular in shape      and is capable of containing flowable material which generally occupies      100 percent of the volume of certain sections of secondary chamber 110      when a force is being applied to primary chamber 100. However, it is to be      understood that the application of an off-center force on primary chamber      100 will affect the flow of flowable material into secondary chamber 110      as discussed above. </PAR><PAR>  The flowable materials useful in the present invention can be any liquid.      Preferred liquids are those having a viscosity ranging from about 0.8      centipoise to about 15,000 centipoise. Examples of suitable liquids      include glycerin, water, oils, fats, greases, and the like. In order to      reduce the overall weight of the padding device, small, lightweight      particles may be included in the flowable material to reduce its total      density. Preferred materials include: (1) mixtures of wax, oil, and      spherical particles; and (2) mixtures of water and/or glycerine, a      viscosity-increasing agent (for example, guar, agar, polyethylene oxide or      cellulose materials such as carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose      and hydroxyethylcellulose or mineral thickeners such as attapulgite clays      (e.g. Attagel.TM.) and fumed silica (e.g. Cab-O-Sil.TM.)), and spherical      particles. </PAR><PAR>  Regarding the method of constructing both embodiments of the present      invention, reference will only be made to the preferred embodiment since      the method of construction is the same although the specific      configurations of various embodiments are different. Elastic material 20      is affixed to backing material 30, preferably by heat sealing the      materials or by using other methods known to those skilled in the art, to      form a configuration comprised of a primary chamber 40, a plurality of      secondary chambers 50, and connecting channels 60 joining each secondary      chamber 50 to primary chamber 40. A small opening is left in the enclosure      for insertion of a filling apparatus into the formed enclosure. The      filling device is thereafter inserted into the opening and a predetermined      volume of flowable material is placed therein, the volume of fluid      inserted ranging from about 20 to about 100 percent of the total available      volume of primary chamber 40, secondary chambers 50, and connecting      channels 60. When the desired volume has been injected, the filling device      is removed and the opening between elastic material 20 and backing      material 30 is sealed. </PAR><PAR>  The above-described structural characteristics of both padding device 10      and padding device 70 allows the present invention to be used in a wide      variety of applications where it is desirable to have a padding device      which, after being subjected to a force and absorbing and/or distributing      at least a portion of the force, will reinitialize itself for subsequent      use. This self-reinitializing feature is particularly desirable for      applications in which repeated or cyclic forces are applied. Consequently,      the preferred application of the present invention is as a foot padding      device. In this application, certain portions of the foot, such as the      heel and the ball, are subjected to these types of repeated forces when      walking, jogging or running. </PAR><PAR>  Other applications for the present invention would include those in which      the applied force(s) may not necessarily be as cyclic as those produced by      walking, jogging, or running. For instance, the present invention would be      suitable for offering protection to participants of many sporting      activities. In this regard, the present invention may be used as an elbow,      knee, or hand pad. Depending upon the portion of the body to be protected,      regardless of the activity, whether it be sporting or otherwise, the      configuration of the present invention may be modified accordingly. More      particularly, the sizes, shapes, and positions of elements of the present      invention may be specifically tailored for the intended end use. The      general force absorbtion and distribution characteristics of the present      invention, particularly the manner of reinitialization, is also similar      regardless of the particular application for which it is being used. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment of the invention, padding device 10 is inserted      into footwear. However, it is to be expressly understood that padding      device 10 can also be incorporated into the construction of the footwear.      Primary chamber 40 is positioned to cushion a certain portion of the      user's foot, most commonly the heel. As the user moves about, the heel      exerts a force on primary chamber 40. The exertion of this force deforms      primary chamber 40 which forces some of the flowable material contained      therein to flow through connecting channels 60 into the plurality of      secondary chambers 50 positioned around the perimeter of the heel. Total      instantaneous deformation of primary chamber 40, i.e., bottoming out, is      prevented by the restrictive nature of connecting channels 60. The rate of      deformation of primary chamber 40 produced by the application of the force      is greater than the rate of flow out of primary chamber 40 through      connecting channels 60 into secondary chambers 50. Channels 60 are      specifically designed so that the total volume of flowable materials      contained in primary chamber 40 cannot be displaced instantaneously      through channels 60. Connecting channels 60, therefore, provide      back-pressure to primary chamber 40, which in conjunction with the initial      deformation of primary chamber 40, provides one way in which padding      device 10 absorbs impact forces. </PAR><PAR>  Although the flowable material contained in primary chamber 40 does not      instantaneously flow into secondary chambers 50 when a force is initially      exerted on primary chamber 40, flow from primary chamber 40 will continue      into secondary chambers 50 until either the force is removed from primary      chamber 40 or it is substantially emptied of flowable material. The energy      required to transfer such flowable materials dissipates a portion of the      impact forces. As flowable material from primary chamber 40 flows into      secondary chambers 50, elastic material 20, which forms a portion of      secondary chambers 50, allows for the expansion thereof. This expansion of      secondary chamber 50 also dissipates some of the energy transferred to      padding device 10 by the impact forces. As the force continues to be      applied to primary chamber 40, the volume increase in secondary chambers      50 will also result in some of the impact forces being distributed to the      outer portions of the heel. </PAR><PAR>  The expansion of secondary chambers 50 in the above-described manners      serves another function in addition to absorbing and distributing impact      forces. Immediately prior to the time when the heel will be lifted from      the surface, thereby removing the applied force, the heel will be fully      seated in primary chamber 40. Coinciding with this depression of primary      chamber 40 is the forming of a barrier around the outer contours of the      foot, more particularly the heel, as a result of expansion of secondary      chambers 50. This barrier around the outer contour of the foot, in      conjunction with the heel being fully seated in primary chamber 40,      provides improved lateral support for the footwear. </PAR><PAR>  When the force is removed from primary chamber 40 by the heel lifting from      the contacted surface, padding device 10 provides a means for      reinitializing the system to allow for repetition of the above-described      method for absorbing and distributing impact forces. As described above,      secondary chambers 50, due to the elasticity of elastic material 20,      expand from an increase in volume when a force is applied to primary      chamber 40. When the force is removed from primary chamber 40 (the heel      coming off of the ground), elastic material 20 forming secondary chambers      50 will contract and attempt to substantially retain its original shape      and volume. When secondary chambers 50 contract in this manner, they act      as individual pumps, and as a result some of the flowable material      contained in secondary chambers 50 is forced to flow back into primary      chamber 40. After all secondary chambers 50 have contracted in this      manner, all or a substantial portion of the volume of flowable material      initially present in primary chamber 40 before impact is placed back into      primary chamber 40. Padding device 10 is then ready for subsequent cycles      of absorbtion and distribution of impact forces. </PAR><PAR>  The attendant advantages with both embodiments of the present invention are      not achievable by known padding devices. The concept of using a plurality      of secondary chambers or a single secondary chamber positioned radially      outwardly from a primary chamber provides a means for distributing impact      forces over a broader area. As described above, as the secondary      chamber(s) expand and receive flowable material from the primary chamber,      some of the impact forces directed upon the primary chamber is transferred      to the outer secondary chamber(s). Therefore, since the force is applied      over a larger area, the pressure experienced by a particular object is      decreased. </PAR><PAR>  Another attendant advantage of the present invention is the positioning of      the secondary chamber(s). As stated above, the secondary chamber(s) may be      located radially outwardly from the primary chamber and positioned to      coincide with the perimeter of the object to be protected. This is      desirable in some applications, primarily the foot pad application. For      instance, when used as a heel pad, the heel depresses the primary chamber      and seats itself therein and the flowable material is forced to flow into      the secondary chamber(s). When the heel is totally depressed in the      primary chamber, the volume of flowable material in the secondary      chamber(s) is at a maximum volume. In essence, a barrier is then formed by      the secondary chamber(s) which surrounds the outer portion of the heel,      thereby improving the lateral support of the footwear which thus decreases      the likelihood of injuring an ankle or a knee, which is a prime      consideration in athletic shoes. </PAR><PAR>  Another attendant advantage of the present invention relates to those      characteristics possessed by the secondary chambers. The elastic materials      forming the secondary chamber(s) allows the secondary chamber(s) to expand      and contract as forces are applied and removed from the primary chamber.      Expansion of the secondary chambers dissipates some of the energy      transferred to the padding device at impact and distributes these impact      forces over a larger area. </PAR><PAR>  With further regard to the secondary chambers, the ability of the secondary      chamber(s) to contract without requiring the application of a force      thereon, a direct result of the elasticity of the materials forming the      secondary chambers, allows the secondary chambers to behave like pumps to      reinitialize the system by transferring flowable materials back to the      primary chamber. Consequently, the padding device can be used on limited      areas, such as the heel, which experience essentially only a single force      and thus does not require the placement of a second chamber in another      region which also experiences an applied force to properly function. </PAR><PAR>  While various embodiments of the present invention have been described in      detail, it is apparent that modifications and adaptations of those      embodiments will occur to those skilled in the art. However, it is to be      expressly understood that such modifications and adaptations are within      the spirit and scope of the present invention, as set forth in the claims      which follow below. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
