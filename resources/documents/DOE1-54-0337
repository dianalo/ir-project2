Recent trends in actual trade patterns and in thetheory of trade and the multinational enterprise are reviewed. The increasingprominence of intraindustry trade has prompted further development intrade theory, while changes in the theory of the multinational enterprise(MNE) have been hard pressed to keep up with changes in MNE activity.Empirical research suggests tentatively that the full employment impactsof the recent American trade deficit have been distributed more evenlyacross census regions than is commonly believed. There has been littleempirical research on the regional impacts of MNEs in the United States,although considerably more has been done in the British Isles;much ofthis has been little guided by economic theory of the MNE or by locationtheory. Opportunities for regional/spatial analysis of foreign tradelie in spatial assessment of comparative advantage. The spatial versionof industrial organization theory, spatial pricing/spatial competitiontheory (SP/SC), has been used in limited analysis of issues in MNE activity,and there appear to be opportunities for extension of SP/SC modelinginto issues of informational asymmetry that could bear on MNE choices.Additionally, locational modeling of integrated, multi-plant firms couldoffer insights into certain aspects of MNE operational behavior. Studiesof the regional impacts of MNE activity in the United States, or in othercountries, needs to take better account of the branch plant as a memberof a multi-plant firm in a noncompetitive industry than has been doneto date.</TEXT></DOC>
