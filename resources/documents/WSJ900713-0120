The poll on social issues found that most Americans thesedays seem generally tolerant on a wide range of issues, fromsexuality to race. Meanwhile, those issues that do pushvoters' &quot;hot buttons&quot; don't seem to primarily favor eitherpolitical party.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The story on social issues is fascinating because itreveals a country that is not ideologically aligned with theleft or the right, but that has a fundamental sense of whatshould constitute public morality in 1990,&quot; say pollstersPeter Hart and Robert Teeter, who conducted the survey forthe Journal and NBC.   The poll, one of four special quarterly surveys theJournal and NBC conduct on various topics, found that someissues seem to represent part of a core set of beliefs orstandards for Americans. When these are violated, moreconservative attitudes seem to prevail. For example, 71% ofvoters surveyed favor the death penalty; 57% support aconstitutional amendment to prohibit burning the flag; 54%favor restrictions on public funding for art that some peoplemay deem obscene.   But on issues involving health and welfare, or affectingprivacy and personal rights, more liberal views seem to holdsway. A principal example is abortion. While 52% of thosepolled said they personally consider abortion to be wrong --a figure that has remained constant in nearly a decade ofsurveys -- an even larger majority of 60% said abortionshouldn't be made illegal.   When asked to choose which among three statements cameclosest to their own views, 57% said abortion should be leftup to the woman and her doctor, 33% said it should beavailable only in cases of rape and incest, and 8% said itshould be illegal in all circumstances. Americans turn moreconservative, however, when the question of abortion rightsis mixed with that of parental rights. By a margin of 75% to21%, they support laws requiring that parents be notifiedbefore a girl under age 18 can have an abortion.   Abortion remains an issue of great intensity at both endsof the spectrum. Yet the Journal/NBC poll also shows itsdivided political impact: Asked which party best deals withthe issue, 27% of voters said Democrats, 20% saidRepublicans, and 35% said both or neither.   Race relations present Americans with a different set ofconflicts. Most voters see the nation making some strides:Asked whether blacks are better off than they were a decadeago, 69% of whites and 60% of blacks said yes. But on otherissues, sharp racial divisions are evident. &quot;When it comes torace, whites tend to see the glass as half full, blacks tendto see the glass as two-thirds empty,&quot; say Mr. Hart and Mr.Teeter.   For example, 40% of whites, but only 20% of blacks,believe relations between their races are either good or verygood; just over a quarter of the whites, but half of theblacks, say relations are fairly poor to poor. The blackskepticism cuts across all age groups and is particularlypronounced among men.   And while 76% of blacks believe they are discriminatedagainst, only 29% of whites agree with them. On the otherhand, whites as well as blacks solidly backaffirmative-action plans in business, providing they contain&quot;no rigid quotas.&quot; And only 15% of whites said they believeblacks are getting too much special treatment.   While the poll found that whites have roughly the sameviews toward Asian-Americans and Hispanics as toward blacks,black voters' attitudes toward these other ethnic groups aremore complex. While they tend to see Hispanics asdiscriminated against, they take a more critical view towardAsian-Americans, with 28% saying they receive too manyspecial advantages.   On a number of other social issues, the Journal/NBC pollfound that Americans seem to share a number of broadattitudes that don't fit neatly into a liberal orconservative profile. In some cases, in fact, largemajorities of voters took the same view despite starkdifferences in how they viewed themselves ideologically:   For example, 73% of voters support banning the sale ofso-called &quot;assault&quot; weapons and semiautomatic rifles. Thefigure was 86% among those the pollsters identified as socialliberals; more surprisingly, even 61% of social conservativesagreed. Equally surprisingly, 58% of social liberals back thedeath penalty. (Black voters, however, are split down themiddle on the question.)   The proposal for a law requiring employers to give unpaidleave to new parents or those caring for sick relatives isanother example of an issue that is popular across the board.Overall, 71% of voters in the poll favor the measure, andmajorities support it in all categories.   &quot;When you find that even 52% of social conservatives favorparental leave, and 58% of social liberals favor the deathpenalty, you have a pretty good consensus,&quot; the pollsterssay.   Compared with other major issues, though, few votersvolunteer the social issues when they are asked to name themost important matters facing the country. Few also giveeither political party a huge edge in addressing such issues.The result, Mr. Hart says, is that neither political partyenters the next election with a clear advantage on thesocial-issues debate.   Instead, the Journal/NBC poll suggests that many votersseem to be searching for a broadly tolerant middle ground.For example, 57% of those polled favor rating and restrictingmusic containing obscenities, much as movies are rated andrestricted now. Fewer than one in three voters would ban suchmusic. On the question of AIDS, 78% said the federalgovernment should continue to make research and treatment atop priority, rather than divert some of the resources toother diseases.   Lost in the sometimes wrenching debates over social-policyquestions in recent years is the fact that on many of theseissues -- abortion, for one -- attitudes haven't shiftedsubstantially in a decade or more. But the Journal/NBC pollfound one area where views clearly have sharply changed:premarital sex. In a September 1978 Gallup poll, 50% of thosepolled said sex before marriage was wrong and 41% said itwasn't; in the new Journal/NBC poll, 60% don't object topremarital sex, while only 33% say it is wrong.   But as some things change, some constants remain. Of thosesurveyed in the Journal/NBC poll, 60% say religion isextremely or very important in their lives. An even largerpercentage, 69%, say religion is either as or more importantto them than it was to their parents when they were growingup.   --- Which party best represents your views on the followingissues?
