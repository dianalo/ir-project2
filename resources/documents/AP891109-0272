The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the clearance, whichis required when the holder of a railroad seeks to acquire another,said Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith.   ``This is part of the process,'' Ms. Smith said Wednesday.``Both Georgia-Pacific and Great Northern control railroads, andthis is a clearance necessary for approval to acquire GreatNorthern's railroads.''   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific now controls four ``short line''railroads, used primarily to transport products and raw materialsto and from company facilities in California, Arkansas, Louisianaand Mississippi.   Great Northern, based in Norwalk, Conn., also controls four raillines _ two in Georgia, one in Mississippi and one in Wisconsin.   Georgia-Pacific last month announced a $3.13 billion offer toacquire Great Northern. The Atlanta company has offered $58 a sharefor each of Great Northern's approximately 54 million shares ofoutstanding stock.   Great Northern is expected to respond to the offer next week.The tender offer expires at midnight EST Nov. 29.   Stephen Hill, Great Northern's director of investor relations,declined to comment on the ICC decision and on his company'scontinued consideration of the Georgia-Pacific offer.   ``We have to issue a formal response next week, and we will,''Hill said.   Since the announcement of Georgia-Pacific's takeover bid, GreatNorthern's officers have been named in two separate federallawsuits challenging anti-takeover measures taken by the directors.The lawsuits were filed in Portland, Maine, where Great Northern isincorporated.</TEXT></DOC>
