(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lockheed Corp.'s prototypeof a 21st century fighter jet made its first flight Saturday in awinner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar AdvancedTactical Fighter contract.   The YF-22 was airborne just 18 minutes, taking off from AirForce Plant 42 in Palmdale and ending 25 mile away at this desertflight test center.   The flight was a milestone in a high-stakes contest between anaerospace team headed by Lockheed and a team led by Northrop Corp.for 1,250 ATF jets, to be built at a projected cost of $51 millionper plane.   The winner must produce a jet that is highly maneuverable, usesradar-evading stealth technology and can fly twice the speed ofsound for long periods of time. The Air Force wants 750 of the newplanes and the Navy needs 500.   Pilot Dave Ferguson said the YF-22 flew as expected although theflight was shortened by 42 minutes because of problems at groundtelemetry stations.   The jet burned so much fuel while sitting on the runway waitingfor takeoff that there wasn't enough left for the scheduledone-hour flight.   ``It was a very easy airplane to fly,'' said Ferguson, adding,``I would be happy to put fuel in it and fly it this afternoon.''   The jet reached an altitude of 12,500 feet and a speed of about280 mph. The two-tone gray jet with stubby wings and a V-shapedtail touched down smoothly in a light rain.   The YF-22 was built by Lockheed, General Dynamics Corp. andBoeing Co. It was unveiled in Palmdale Aug. 29, two days after theYF-23, built by Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., madeits first flight.   Lockheed Vice President Sherman Mullin, head of the YF-22project, said he could not compare the two planes because he didn'thave enough information about the YF-23.   Each team has spent about $600 million producing two prototypejets each.   ``It's obviously an extremely important program to us,'' saidMullin. ``(But) it's not a program that's going to make or breakthe Lockheed Corp.''   Both planes are built of advanced composite materials. TheLockheed aircraft has stubby wings. The Northrop fighter has alonger, cigarlike fuselage and a wingspread that looks like a kite.   ``This is a great day from a technological perspective,'' saidGary L. Denman, who heads an Air Force research division. ``I canassure you, what's out there in the airplane is the best in theworld.''   Survival of the advanced fighter program was threatened byCongress until Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The crisis hasenhanced prospects for approval of major defense contracts.   If Northrop and McDonnell Douglas win the contract, the YF-23would be built in California. The Lockheed-General Dynamics-Boeingteam plans to build YF-22s in Marietta, Ga., if it wins. Theselection is due in 1991.   The $51 million cost of each jet is about twice that of the AirForce's present top fighter, the F-15 Eagle.</TEXT></DOC>
