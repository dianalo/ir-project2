Members of the executive branch and independent agencies areprohibited from supplementing salaries with fees and honoraria forjob-related activities. Violators are subject to up to a year inprison.   Congressional salaries are now $89,500 a year, which senatorsmay supplement with honoraria in an amount not to exceed 40 percentof their salaries. The percentage for House members is 30 percent.   Weld said the payment of $2,000 fees to members of Congress whovisited a business establishment over which their committee hadjurisdiction ``would be a laydown criminal case if performed bysomebody in the executive branch.''   ``You have the double standard (of) criminal acts by one branchof government'' being legal in another ``and that really is neitherlogical nor is it consonant with the notion of fair play,'' Weldsaid in remarks at the National Press Club.   He said raising congressional salaries and applying the ban onoutside payments would end ``any risk that these fees or honorariawould be influencing a legislator's sense of how to spend his time,much less his vote.'' Higher salaries might attract talented peoplewho otherwise would be unable to afford being in Congress.   In response to questions, he rejected the suggestion that hiscomments were an attempt to overshadow the fact that a number ofReagan administration officials are under criminal investigation orhave been convicted of crimes.   ``My remarks today are the same as remarks I've been giving ...since 1978,'' said Weld, a former U.S. attorney in Boston and aformer candidate for state attorney general in Massachusetts.   Weld's boss, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, is underinvestigation in the Wedtech scandal and in connection with a $1billion proposed Iraqi pipeline project that may have involvedplanned payoffs to the Israeli Labor Party.   Weld also criticized Congress for excluding itself from coverageof conflict-of-interest laws, which former White House politicaldirector Lyn Nofziger was convicted last month of violating onbehalf of scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and two other clients.   The assistant attorney general noted the lack of restrictions onlobbying by former congressmen.   ``The day after a congressman leaves office, he is free to lobbyhis former colleagues on behalf of himself or his friends orclients, while continuing to enjoy full access to the House andSenate floors,'' said Weld. ``As recent events have made abundantlyclear, such behavior by a former member of the executive branchwould land one in jail.''   Nofziger, under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, was foundguilty of lobbying his former agency within one year after he leftthe government on matters in which the agency had beensubstantially involved.   The matters pertained to a federal contract for Wedtech, thecontinued production of A10 anti-tank aircraft and civilian manningof Navy ships.   Nofziger faces sentencing later this month.</TEXT></DOC>
