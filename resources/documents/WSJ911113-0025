In a speech at a fund-raising luncheon in New Yorkyesterday, Mr. Bush said, &quot;I'd frankly like to see thecredit-card rates down. I believe that would help stimulatethe consumer and get the consumer confidence moving again.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But bankers and industry consultants said credit-cardrates are unlikely to come down from their current averagerate of 18.8%, and one banker called President Bush'sstatement another way of blaming the &quot;ills of the economy onbanks.&quot;   Even among a handful of banks that are responding toconsumer criticisms, lower-rate cards are being offered onlyto their best customers, and with reluctance.   The banks aren't &quot;going to give up their profits without abattle,&quot; said Robert Heady, editor of Bank Rate Monitor, anewsletter that tracks credit-card rates. &quot;The rates havebeen fixed in cement and that's not going to change soon.&quot;   Spencer Nilson, publisher of the Nilson Report, anindustry newsletter, said consumers aren't spending becauseof the economy, not because of high credit-card rates. &quot;In arecessionary period, people are trying to pay down theirdebt,&quot; Mr. Nilson said. &quot;They're not going to rack up moredebt just because interest rates went down.&quot;   But consumer advocacy groups lauded President Bush for&quot;finally acknowledging the exorbitant rates,&quot; although theycouldn't see the rates going down as a result. The averagecredit-card rate has hovered between 18.7% and 18.9% thisyear although the cost of funds have dropped considerably forbanks. The prime rate, for example, has dropped 2.5percentage points, to 7.5%, since the beginning of the year.   &quot;The President's announcement isn't enough for banks togive up their profitable revenue stream.&quot; said a spokeswomanfor the Bankcard Holders of America, a Herndon, Va., consumergroup.   Banks have blamed high credit-card rates on increaseddelinquency rates and lower revenue as a result of moreconsumers paying down their debt. &quot;Expenses are rising whilerevenues are declining,&quot; said Mr. Nilson.   But some banks, albeit quietly, have begun heedingconsumer criticism. Several banks, trying to stem attrition,have started offering lower-rate cards to certain customersin the last several months.   First Chicago Corp. recently cut credit-card rates to someof its most creditworthy customers to 14.4%. That movefollowed the lead of Citicorp, which offers its Choice cardwith a tiered rate of 13.8% for card holders with balancesabove $1,300 and 16.9% for balances below that.   But consumers are apparently getting more savvy aboutshopping around for the best rates. Robert McKinley,publisher of RAM Research Bankcard Update, said 30% ofconsumers now carry credit cards that have variable rates,which fluctuate depending on the prime rate and otherfactors, but is generally lower than fixed rates. That's upfrom 10% in 1986.   &quot;The industry is slowly responding to the criticism,&quot; Mr.McKinley said. &quot;They'll offer an alternative card if youask.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
