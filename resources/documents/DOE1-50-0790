As these types of insulationshave highly anisotropic properties, the total heat transfer characteristicsmust be determined. Data are presented on the thermal diffusivity andthermal conductivity of four types of MIs and are compared to the baselineAdvanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation currently used on the SpaceShuttle Orbiter. In addition, the high temperature properties of thefibers used in these MIs are discussed. The fibers investigated includedsilica and three types of aluminoborosilicate (ABS). Static tension testswere performed at temperatures up to 1200 C and the ultimate strain,tensile strength, and tensile modulus of single fibers were determined.</TEXT></DOC>
