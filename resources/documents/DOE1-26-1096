As inother metals, the Kr precipitates in small cavities. Electron diffractiondemonstrates that the Kr precipitates are solid, fcc crystals alignedwith each other and the Ni lattice. The trends are similar to those observedfor Kr precipitation in Al at room temperature. The average Kr latticeparameter, determined from the electron diffraction, increases with increasingKr fluence from 0.515 nm to an asymptotic value of 0.545 nm. The asymptoticlimit is due to the melting of the larger Kr precipitates. The mismatchbetween the Kr and Ni lattices is as large as 55%. Diffuse electron scatteringwas observed from large, liquid Kr precipitates. This occurs for Kr fluencesabove 5 . 10/sup 20/Kr/sup +/m/sup -2/ in Ni and above 2.5 . 10/sup 20/Kr/sup+/m/sup -2/ in Al. At room temperature, the largest solid Kr precipitateobserved in dark field images was 8.3 nm in diameter compared to 4.7nm in Al. The larger precipitates are liquid or gas. The solid Kr metalsat the same lattice parameter in both Ni and Al suggesting that the meltingis thermodynamic in nature and independent of the host material.</TEXT></DOC>
