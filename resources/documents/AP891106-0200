They blockedcity roads and bridges, too, shutting down the city for nearly aweek in hopes that the chaos would topple Premier Li Peng andothers who ordered the army attack.   Gansu Gov. Jia Zhijie mobilized thousands of police to removethe blockades and round up protesters. ``When a rat runs across thestreet, everybody cries, `Kill it,''' he said grimly.   Lanzhou is far from the most remote place where peopleprotested. The government says 80 cities were affected, but thenumber seems much larger.   Domestic radio in May reported marches in a dozen cities andtowns in the southwestern province of Sichuan alone, including someplaces so small they could not be found in an atlas. A recenttraveler to a dozen semi-rural county towns was told in each thatprotests were held there in the spring.   During the height of the movement, hundreds of thousands ofstudents traveled between Beijing and other cities, sharinginformation and funds. Although their illegal unions have beendisbanded, ties of sympathy remain.   Asked if he believed the protests were counter-revolutionary,one student in Xian declared: ``We have brains, we also arestudents. Students all over the country are in unison.''   Several months into the new school year, this unison seemsunlikely to translate into action anytime soon.   Under the most intense and wide-reaching government attack inyears on dissent and anything else that offends the leaders, mostpeople _ students included _ have subsided into silentintrospection.   There are reports that gambling and drinking are on the increaseamong students. At one technical school, students were foundgambling at mah-jongg, an ancient tile game, and were givendemerits, a fellow student said.   ``The students are depressed. They don't cooperate. They don't`biaotai' (make the ritual declaration of their political loyalty)or if they do it's just perfunctory,'' said Wang Shuying, aprovincial government employee, privately confirming what teachersand students have said.   ``The political education has no impact. People are trying toleave. Those who before were willing to wait for their work unitsto send them abroad are trying now to pay their own way.''   Wang, who does not speak a foreign language, has no hope ofleaving. He wavers between bitter envy of the students' arroganceand a shared hatred for the party.   ``Wang Dan and the others, their lives were easy,'' she said,referring to a top Beijing student leader now under arrest.``That's why they dared speak _they had no political experience.''   She has spent most of her more than 30 years under the inheritedstigma of her parents' 1957 label as ``rightists.''   ``Speaking out does no good,'' she said, anger in her voice.``You can't change anything. You can only make it harder foryourself later on. The arm cannot be stronger than the leg.'' Theleg in China is the Communist Party.   ``Chinese intellectuals are weak,'' she adds. ``Yes, I countmyself among them. There's something lacking in our character. Whyhave all modern Chinese leaders been peasants? Look at MaoTse-tung, Deng Xiaoping.''   Wei shares some of Wang's doubts.   ``We talked about democracy, but no one really knew what itis,'' he said. ``I only know what it is not. How does it work? Weneed to find out more about it.''   When, like thousands of students, he traveled to Beijing in Mayto join the sit-in in Tiananmen Square, he found the movementpresided over by a few students who were inaccessible behindcordons of pickets, just like party leaders.   ``Some people say that in 30 years when this generation comes topower, we will overthrow the system,'' he said. ``But others say wewill only change the name of the party from Communist and nothingwill really change, just like the Communists replaced the emperorsbut became new emperors.   ``Deng Xiaoping was suppressed once, and now he suppressesothers. Some say Wu'er Kaixi (a student leader who fled to theUnited States) will be the next Deng Xiaoping.''   In the end, Wang said, it may not matter whether theintellectuals choose socialism or capitalism, democracy orauthoritarianism. Rising unemployment and the gap in livingstandards between cities and villages may trigger mass anger thatwill put China's future, once again, in the hands of peasantsmotivated not by democracy but by their pocketbooks.   Chengdu's experience may be telling. Many of those who clashedwith police there in early June, setting buses on fire and throwingbricks and stones, were peasants come from the countryside to lookfor work. Both of the two men executed in Chengdu were peasants _one was 61, the other was 19.</TEXT><TEXT>   The penalty was heavy, but some still look back with nostalgiaon the heady days of spring.   ``Students from the Communications University went aroundcollecting money to give the students in Beijing,'' a Xian factoryworker recalled, waiting wearily at midnight for a late train.``People didn't think, I have 10 bucks, I'll give the students 5.They gave whatever money they had.''   As in Beijing, most of the scars of Xian's protests have beenscrubbed or painted over. A young office worker stood in the rainin Xincheng Square, where Xian students held a month-long sit-in inthe spring, and looked about as if searching for the vanishedbanners and tents.   ``It looked just like Tiananmen Square,'' he said. ``They had abroadcast station over here and another at the bell tower. Thestudents closed off the street, but I got in and took somephotographs.''   He keeps the negatives hidden, unprinted, waiting for a moretolerant time.   Wei, too, has hidden photographs and memories.   ``Everyone thinks Beijing people are great. I had no place tostay and a man offered to take me in. My friend was walking downthe street in Beijing and a man stopped him and said, `Are you astudent?' The man took him to a restaurant and gave him a bigdinner.   ``I am proud I went. I don't know what will happen in thefuture, but it was history and I saw it.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
