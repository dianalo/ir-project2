Imported luxury cars, special supplies of food, pleasure tripsabroad and rounds of banqueting all must come to an end, the partyPolitburo ordered in its most serious attack yet on endemiccorruption that has cost the party much popular support.   If carried out, the Politburo order would affect officials atthe uppermost levels of the party and government, who have beenexempt from anti-corruption and austerity drives.   The Politburo's notice was read on television at the end of atwo-day closed meeting in Zhongnanhai, the party compound where topleaders maintain homes of relative luxury. Zhongnanhai once waspart of the imperial palace, and its red walls have become a symbolto ordinary Chinese of the privileges of those in power.   The Politburo order clearly was triggered by the studentdemocracy movement that was crushed in June, which drew hundreds ofthousands of supporters with the slogan, ``Oppose corruption.''   The students also lampooned children of senior officials whoenjoy top posts in government and business, including Deng's son,whom they nicknamed ``Prince Pufang.''   The Politburo ordered two companies directly under the StateCouncil, or cabinet, be shut down, including the Kang HuaDevelopment Corp., which is linked to Deng Pufang.   Kang Hua was formed under the auspices of Deng Pufang's ChinaWelfare Fund for the Handicapped, and it allegedly used theconnection to evade taxes while developing into one of China'slargest foreign trade companies.   The party also shut down the China Industry and CommerceEconomic Development Corp. and ordered two leading investmentcompanies to merge.   It gave the spouses and children of senior government and partyofficials until Sept. 1 to resign from jobs in ``commercialbusiness and trading companies.''   The Politburo notice also:   _ Ordered a shake-up of state companies dealing in foreigntrade, material supplies and finance. Trade officials already havesaid they plan to sharply reduce the number of companies authorizedto conduct foreign trade.   _ Banned party Politburo, party Secretariat and State Councilpersonnel from driving imported cars and exchanging banquets andgifts paid for with state funds.   _ Said ministers and provincial leaders may travel abroad onlyon business relevant to their posts, and cannot accept invitationsfrom foreign businessmen. Offers of trips abroad have becomepopular bribes.   _ Ordered an end to special food supplies for high officials``who shall have the same ration and pay the same price as ordinarycitizens.''   _ Ordered severe punishment for corruption.   As early as the 1960s, the public image of China's Communistleaders had changed from that of spartan revolutionaries to apampered elite. But it took the economic decentralization of thepast decade to add bribery and black marketeering to the list ofofficial privileges.   Since ending the student protests and purging party GeneralSecretary Zhao Ziyang, the party has blamed him for its corruptionproblem, although he was party chief for only two years.   A Chinese student who helped lead the pro-democracydemonstrations in Beijing told a conference in Chicago that a``goddess of democracy'' statue will be raised again in TiananmenSquare.   ``Some say China has no hope for democracy, but I say the hopeis just beginning,'' said Wu'er Kaixi, 21, speaking in Chicago atthe opening session of a weekend congress of Chinese students inthe United States.   ``I believe the Chinese can be united and will erect a goddessof democracy in Tiananmen Square one day,'' he said. A statue madeof plaster and resembling the Statue of Liberty was placed in thesquare by the demonstrating students but it was torn apart when themilitary moved in June 3-4.   Wu'er fled during the crackdown and managed to escape to Paris.More than 300 people attended Friday's session at the University ofIllinois-Chicago.   Wu'er, speaking in Chinese, said, ``If the present communistgovernment is so confident that people love them, why should theybe scared of elections?   ``Because there is a chance they (the leaders) may end up inhistory's wastebasket.''</TEXT></DOC>
