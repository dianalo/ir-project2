Kennedy Jr. has pleaded guilty tospeeding and driving an uninspected car, but plans to contestcharges that his car was unregistered and uninsured, a newspaperreports.   Kennedy, 28, is expected to appear Friday before anadministrative law judge at a state Motor Vehicles office, the DailyNews reported today.   The lack of insurance on Kennedy's 1973 Volkswagen was the mostserious offense cited on July 7, said George Filieau, a MotorVehicles spokesman.   Kennedy, sworn in this week as an assistant district attorney inManhattan, pleaded guilty by mail and paid what he thought was owedfor the speeding and inspection tickets.   However, his check was returned because it was insufficient andhe still has to register the car, according to Filieau.
