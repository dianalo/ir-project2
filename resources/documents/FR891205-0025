Introduction</ITAG>A. Statutory AuthorityEPA is adding nine chemicals to the list of toxic substances under section313(c) of EPCRA. Section 313 of EPCRA requires owners and operators ofcovered facilities to report annually their releases of listed toxic chemicals.EPCRA section 313(d)(1) authorizes EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicalsfrom the list of toxic chemicals by rulemaking at any time. Section 313(d)(2)states that a chemical may be added if the Administrator determines thatthere is sufficient evidence to establish that a chemical is known to causeor can reasonably be anticipated to cause adverse acute human health effectsbeyond facility site boundaries based on frequently recurring or continuousreleases, chronic human health effects, or environmental toxicity.B. BackgroundOn April 21, 1989 (54 FR 16138), EPA issued a proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to add 10 chemicals to the list of toxic chemicalsunder section 313 of EPCRA.EPA proposed the addition of these nine chemicals on the basis of theircarcinogenicity or other chronic toxicity as reflected in determinationsmade under section 102 of CERCLA. EPA also proposed the addition of toluenediisocyanate(mixed isomers). It is expected that mixtures of these isomers will generallycause the same health and environmental effects as the individual isomersalready included on the section 313 list. A detailed description of EPA'smethodology and rationale for the addition of these chemicals can be foundin the proposed rule. The following table lists the 10 chemicals whichwere proposed for addition to the section 313 list. As discussed below,EPA is not finalizing its proposal to add diethylamine to the section 313list at this time. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L1,i1,xls50,r50,5,5,15,20</C>Table 1._Proposed Addition Candidates:CERCLA Section 102 Chemicals with Cancer and Chronic Toxicity Concerns<H1>CAS Registry Number</H1><H1>Chemical Name</H1><H1>RQ Score</H1><H1>Basis of Score</H1><H1>Federal Register Citation</H1><H1>Chemical Specific Docket Number</H1><ITAG tagnum="2">78-88-6<D>2,3-DICHLOROPROPENE</D><D>100</D><D>CTX</D><D>51 FR 34534</D><D>102RQ-R1-2-1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">99-65-0<D> m-DINITROBENZENE</D><D>100</D><D>CTX</D><D>50 FR 13456</D><D>102RQ-10-3-60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">100-25-4<D>p-DINITROBENZENE</D><D>100</D><D>CTX</D><D>50 FR 13456</D><D>102RQ-10-3-60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">107-18-6<D>ALLYL ALCOHOL</D><D>100</D><D>CTX</D><D>50 FR 13456</D><D>102RQ-10-3-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">109-89-7<D>DIETHYLAMINE</D><D>100</D><D>CTX</D><D>51 FR 34534</D><D>102RQ-R1-2-1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">120-58-1<D>ISOSAFROLE</D><D>100</D><D>CARC</D><D>54 FR 33426</D><D>102RQ-273C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">528-29-0<D>o-DINITROBENZENE</D><D> 100</D><D>CTX</D><D>50 FR 13456</D><D>102RQ-10-3-60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">8001-58-9<D>CREOSOTE</D><D> 1</D><D> CARC</D><D>54 FR 33426</D><D>102RQ-273C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">25321-14-6<D>DINITROTOLUENE (mixed isomers)</D><D>10</D><D>CARC</D><D>54 FR 33426</D><D>102RQ-273C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">26471-62-5<D>TOLUENEDIISOCYANATE (mixed isomers)</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note</T4>: Known production volumes range from 236,000 to 315,000,000lbs/yr.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">CTX = Chronic Toxicity; CARC = Potential Carcinogenicity.</ITAG>While the section 313 list has been modified in the past to reflect EPA'sresponse to 37 section 313 petitions, this is the Agency's first internallyinitiated list modification. EPA plans to continue to review and modifythis list as necessary to be consistent with the section 313 list criteria.Reporting for the identified chemicals will be required for activitiesduring the 1990 calendar year. As such, the first reports for the addedchemicals must be submitted to EPA and States by July 1, 1991.<ITAG tagnum="84"> II. Summary of Public Comment</ITAG>The public comment period on the proposed rule ended on June 5, 1989. Atotal of six comments were received from: Environmental Action Foundation(EAF); Hoechst Celanese Corporation; Entergy Services, Incorporated; TheWorking Group on Community Right-to-Know; National Wildlife Federation(NWF); and American Wood Preservers Institute (AWPI).Almost all of the commenters expressed a strong support for EPA's initiativeto add chemicals to the section 313 list. Along with their support, commentswere received on EPA's methodology, the addition of diethylamine, and ToxicRelease Inventory reporting of creosote.Comments received from Entergy Services, Inc. dealt exclusively with theirdesire for EPA to adjust the CERCLA reportable quantity (RQ) for creosotefrom 1 lb to 100 lbs. This comment is not relevant to this final rule toadd creosote to the section 313 list but has been referred to EPA's Officeof Solid Waste and Emergency Response for its consideration.A. MethodologyAs discussed in the preamble of the proposed rule, EPA used a methodologypremised on the review of analyses conducted under section 102 of CERCLA.EPA utilized those CERCLA reportable quantities (RQs) that had been establishedbecause of cancer or other chronic health effects.EAF and NWF both had the opinion that EPA was overly restrictive in settingcriteria for addition to the section 313 list. NWF comments focused onthe fact that neither acute human toxicity nor environmental toxicity wereconsidered in the proposal. EPA specifically addressed this issue in the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="21"> In reviewing the RQ methodology for its application to the section313(d)(2) criteria, EPA wanted to ensure that chemicals which are addedto the section 313 list have high concerns for properties which are mostrelevant to section 313. For example, ignitability and reactivity whichare not specifically mentioned in section 313(d) have not been consideredin this rulemaking. For this reason, EPA considered only the criteria ofchronic toxicity and carcinogenicity. Although aquatic and mammalian toxicityare relevant to section 313, EPA chose to only address chronic human toxicityin this rulemaking. As previously stated, this is EPA's first attempt toinitiate modification to the section 313 list; other section 313 toxicityendpoints, such as aquatic and mammalian toxicity, will be considered infuture modifications.</ITAG>EPA will consider acute toxicity and environmental toxicity for futureadditions to the list.EAF commented that reactivity, explosivity, and ignitability should alsobe considered for making additions to the list.EPA evaluates chemicals for addition to and deletion from the section 313list by applying the criteria established under section 313(d)(2). Whilethe above properties are not explicitly cited as criteria for modificationsto the list, EPA can consider these properties as they may potentiallyrelate to the specific criteria under section 313(d)(2) in future rulemakings.B. Chemicals and Chemical ListsEAF and NWF both stated that while the proposed additions to the section313 list are certainly warranted, many more chemicals and chemical listsneed to be evaluated. EAF generally stated that non-EPA lists should beconsidered for addition. NWF specifically suggested adding chemicals fromthe Priority Pollutant List of the Clean Water Act, sections 302 and 304of EPCRA, section 3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAct (FIFRA), section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(RCRA), section 103(a) of CERCLA, and hazardous chemicals under the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard.EPA certainly recognizes that there are many more chemicals which stillneed to be evaluated for addition to the section 313 list. As stated inthe proposed rule:<ITAG tagnum="21">This action represents only the first attempt by EPA to modify thelist of reportable chemicals under section 313. EPA will continue to lookto other sources to add chemicals to the list which pose known or anticipatedhealth and environmental hazards as established in section 313(d). TheAgency is currently looking into a more comprehensive effort in developinga process to screen chemicals for addition to and deletion from the section313 list.</ITAG>While only at the beginning stages, EPA has begun to develop a processto screen chemicals for potential addition to the list. This will involvethe evaluation of regulatory and non-regulatory lists, as developed withinand outside the Agency.EAF commented that they are concerned by one of the reasons EPA gives forusing the CERCLA section 102 list as a starting point; that toxicologicalevaluations have already been conducted for CERCLA section 102 chemicals.They object to such criteria stating that little is known about many chemicalsprecisely because reporting has not been required.EPA can only add chemicals to the list if these chemicals can be reasonablyanticipated to cause one of the human health or environmental effects statedin section 313(d)(2). In other words, under section 313 EPA cannot placea reporting burden on the reporting community for a chemical for whichEPA cannot reasonably anticipate human health or environmental concerns.Using the toxicological evaluations that have already been conducted forthe CERCLA section 102 chemicals allowed EPA to rely on data on carcinogenicityand chronic toxicity which has already been reviewed by EPA. EPA believesthat these assessments are adequate to make the finding under section 313(d)(2)that the chemicals can be reasonably anticipated to cause cancer or otherchronic effects to humans.C. Arbitrary Selection of CERCLA RQ ValuesMany of the commenters stated that EPA's selection of an RQ of 100 lbsis arbitrary and is not an indication of toxicity. Certain commenters statedthat many chemicals with higher RQs may meet the criteria as establishedunder section 313(d)(2) for addition to the list.EPA's selection of the 100 lb RQ as a screening tool was based on its experiencewith the methodology and criteria to assign RQ scores for each of the sevenprimary areas; potential carcinogenicity, chronic toxicity, acute toxicity,environmental toxicity, mammalian toxicity, reactivity, and ignitability.EPA believes that chemicals with an RQ of 100 lbs for either cancer orchronic toxicity would most certainly meet the criteria under section 313(d)(2).However, this does not imply that chemicals assigned RQ values greaterthan 100 lbs do not necessarily meet the criteria under section 313(d)(2).D. Multiple Criteria for Addition to the ListTwo comments were received which interpreted the methodology for the proposedchemicals as requiring that more than one criterion under section 313(d)(2)had to be met to add a chemical to the section 313 list. The statute clearlystates that the Administrator need only to establish that a chemical meetany one of the criteria to warrant addition to the section 313 list.EPA agrees that a chemical only needs to meet one of the criteria for healthand environmental effects under section 313(d)(2). There seems to be someconfusion with respect to the methodology employed in the proposal. Thecommenters may have assumed that EPA considered only the final publishedRQ in screening chemicals for addition.As stated in the proposal:<ITAG tagnum="21">CERCLA section 102(a) allows EPA to adjust RQ levels for specificchemicals. In establishing and adjusting the RQ levels, EPA evaluates theintrinsic physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of each chemical.The primary criteria used to adjust an RQ for a particular chemical arecarcinogenicity, chronic toxicity, aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity,ignitability, and reactivity. EPA assigns RQ values for each of the sixprimary areas mentioned above. Chemicals with final RQ scores of 100 orless based on aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity, ignitability, and reactivitywere screened for scores reflecting assessments based on their cancer andchronic toxicity potential. In other words, a chemical with a final RQof 1 pound based on reactivity was still screened for its carcinogenicityand chronic toxicity scores. If [either] score is less than or equal to100 pounds, then the chemical meets the threshold outlined in this proposal.</ITAG>The Agency recognizes that a chemical only needs to satisfy one of thetoxicity criteria to warrant its addition to the section 313 list. Forthis rulemaking, EPA only evaluated the RQ values that were assigned specificallyfor cancer or chronic toxicity. As another example, allyl alcohol has beenevaluated specifically for chronic toxicity where an RQ of 100 lbs hasbeen assigned for chronic toxicity. While this chemical may have an evenlower RQ value for one of the other endpoints mentioned above, only thechronic toxicity and carcinogenicity RQ values were considered.E. Production VolumeEPA received several comments regarding the use of production volume asa criterion for listing and on the use of the TSCA Confidential UpdateSystem (CUS).Commenters questioned any use of production volume for additions to thelist, claiming that facilities which exceed the reporting thresholds wouldreport under section 313 and those facilities which fall below would not.Commenters stated that it is inappropriate for EPA to look at productionvolume at all. The Agency should only examine chemicals' potential healthand environmental effects.Many commenters also questioned the use of the TSCA CUS noting its limitationswith respect to inorganic chemicals, its accuracy, and the fact that itis a confidential data base being used for community right-to-know purposes.If production volume is going to play a role in making additions to thesection 313 list, commenters stated that other production volume data shouldbe considered.EPA's position on these issues has been set forth in the proposal. TheCERCLA section 102 list was screened for production volume to eliminatefrom consideration any chemical without a known production volume of atleast 25,000 pounds, because 25,000 pounds is the reporting threshold formanufacturers and processors under section 313 of EPCRA. EPA wanted toensure that it adds chemicals to the list which will result in valuableinformation on chemical releases into the environment. The public is notserved if EPA adds chemicals to the list for which no reports would bereceived because the chemicals are not produced. For this reason, EPA believesit is appropriate to consider production volume on potential candidatesfor addition once an evaluation of the health and environmental toxicityhas been conducted.EPA agrees with the commenters that other sources, in addition to the TSCACUS data base, should be considered in future rulemakings to include importationand chemical intermediates. It is important to stress that this is EPA'sfirst attempt to add chemicals to the list and a more comprehensive processfor making modifications to the section 313 list is being developed.F. DiethylamineHoechst Celanese Corp. commented on the available data on diethylamineand requested that EPA reconsider the addition of this chemical to thesection 313 list. EPA cited a 1951 study conducted by Brieger and Hodesas the basis for chronic toxicity concerns. Hoechst Celanese raises severalissues with respect to this study.(1) The study used the rabbit as the exposure species, which is an unconventionalchoice for inhalation studies by today's standards.(2) Only six animals were used per dose group and the sex was not specified.(3) While the investigators noted multiple corneal erosions and edema at50 ppm, no such effects were noted at 100 ppm.(4) The study was only 6 weeks in duration.Hoechst Celanese provided a much more recent study with diethylamine conductedby (Lynch, et. al.) at the National Institute of Occupational Safety andHealth (NIOSH) in 1986. The Lynch study was 24 weeks in duration and used200 rats (100 male and female) per dose group. No effects were noted atthe 25 ppm dose level. At 250 ppm, the primary effects were related torespiratory irritation. None of the effects cited in the earlier studywere cited in the Lynch study.A review of the Brieger and Hodes study indicates that this study was notconducted using EPA guidelines (conducted before there was an EPA), thatit is a less than perfect study, but that the study is sufficient for settingand supporting a CERCLA RQ for chronic toxicity. It should be noted thatthe Lynch study is being evaluated for a possible technical update of theCERCLA RQ for diethylamine. The contention that the rabbit is an unconventionalchoice for inhalation testing relates to the difficulty of conducting thistype of test in rabbits. It does not make the rabbit an inappropriate testspecies for this chemical. In fact, it is possible that the variance betweenthe Brieger and Hodes study and the Lynch study indicates that the rabbitis a more sensitive species for the subject chemical.However, the Hoechst Celanese comments do raise concerns regarding EPA'sselection of this chemical for addition to the section 313 list of toxicchemicals. The low number of animals used in the Brieger study, the shortduration of the study, the lack of a dose-dependent response, and the lackof confirmation in the more recent Lynch study are factors that indicatea need for further analysis before EPA adds this chemical to the section313 list. Therefore, EPA is not adding diethylamine to the section 313list pending further review.G. CreosoteThe AWPI provided comment on the proposed addition of creosote to the section313 list. The industry is generally supportive of this idea, provided thatreporting of creosote is in lieu of, and not in addition to, reportingof its listed constituents. AWPI's comments addressed four specific issues:listing of creosote as a section 313 toxic chemical; reporting of creosoteunder section 313 in lieu of its constituents; creosote emissions estimationmethodologies; and the carcinogenicity of creosote.1. <T3> Listing creosote as a distinct compound.</T3> Creosote is a distillationproduct from coal tar pitch. As such, it is a naturally occurring mixturein that it is not manufactured by the assembly or formulation of ingredientsnor are any other substances intentionally added to it during its processing.Creosote is composed of as many as 200 individual components with 20 beinggenerally recognized at levels of 1.0 percent or greater. (Three of thesechemicals are individually listed on the section 313 list: anthracene,dibenzofuran, and naphthalene.) Industry believes that health risk assessmentsof the whole compound (creosote) are appropriate and are sufficient indicatorsof real world toxicity and exposures.AWPI's main point is that numerous government entities have regulated andcontinue to look at creosote as a discrete compound with a distinct chemicalidentity: creosote is a listed hazardous waste under the RCRA and is aCERCLA hazardous substance. Beyond EPA, OSHA regulates creosote as a hazardoussubstance in the workplace, and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) andthe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have both evaluatedthe carcinogenicity of creosote as a discrete entity. AWPI also pointsto the fact that creosote has been assigned a CAS registry number.EPA generally agrees with AWPI with respect to treating creosote as a distinctentity and that reporting under section 313 should take place for thatentity in lieu of the individual components. EPA wants to ensure, however,that release determinations are expressed properly under section 313.Recognizing the complexity of creosote with respect to its constituents,EPA believes that release estimates under EPCRA section 313 should be fortotal organics attributable to creosote that are released to each medium.For example, while creosote is manufactured, processed, or used, releasesto air might occur from the volatile components of creosote. While thenumber of individual components and percentages of the volatiles wouldbe different from the original creosote mixture, EPA believes that thetotal amount of these volatiles must be reported as emissions of creosoteto air. EPA is stressing this point since, in the above example, it mightbe interpreted that creosote (in its entirety) is not being emitted intothe air and as such, emissions are reported as zero.While the policy under section 313 has not necessarily been to considera CAS registry number as the identifier for determining the reportabilityof a substance, EPA agrees with AWPI that treating creosote as a discretechemical substance is reasonable for this particular situation.2. <T3> Reporting creosote on Form R in lieu of its constituents.</T3> AWPIhas pointed out that creosote is handled and applied as a discrete compoundby government, health professionals, and industry. It makes sense to continuethis approach in all regulatory contexts. Reporting of creosote and itssection 313 listed constituents would result in double counting of emissions.AWPI has also indicated that the burden of reporting for individual listedchemicals within creosote is greater than the burden would be for reportingfor creosote in lieu of its constituents.EPA agrees that reporting emissions of creosote should be in lieu of reportingsection 313 listed components. Anthracene, dibenzofuran, and naphthaleneare all major components of creosote. Individual reports for these substancesas they result from creosote would not be required. However, it shouldbe emphasized that facilities which separately employ a section 313 listedchemical (such as the above three) in any manufacture, process, or useactivity are still subject to reporting releases of those chemicals. Forexample, a creosote solution in naphthalene would be considered to containtwo reportable section 313 chemicals. Estimations of the releases wouldhave to be made for the naphthalene solvent as well as creosote.Reporting creosote as a single entity is somewhat precedent setting undersection 313. In the past, EPA guidance to reporting has been chemical-specific.Individual section 313 listed chemicals in mixtures, whether or not themixture is described by a CAS registry number, require threshold and releasedeterminations for the individual listed chemical(s). With respect to creosote,facilities are currently making estimates of releases for the three individuallylisted chemicals. According to AWPI, making a single report for releasesof the entity, creosote will be less burdensome than reporting individuallisted chemicals. Estimating releases for creosote, while less burdensome,will not necessarily be straightforward. As such, EPA is providing guidancebelow for estimating creosote releases.3.<T3> Carcinogenicity of creosote.</T3> AWPI contends that the IARC andNTP reviews on creosote are incomplete because they do not include unpublishedstudies. The unpublished studies are referred to by AWPI as three epidemiologicalstudies which show that exposure to creosote in the wood treating industrydoes not adversely affect human health.With regard to the cancer criterion under section 313, EPA must concludethat a chemical causes or can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancerin humans in order to include that chemical on the section 313 list. Aswith IARC and NTP, EPA can only consider data which are available whenassessing the potential toxicity of any chemical. While there may be unpublishedepidemiological studies on creosote which AWPI claims show no adverse humanhealth related effects, there are still data to indicate that there islimited human evidence, and sufficient animal evidence to reasonably anticipatethat creosote causes cancer in humans. IARC and NTP have concluded thatcreosote is a possible human carcinogen. It should be noted that AWPI didnot include these unpublished reports in their comments. Despite AWPI commentsconcerning the epidemiologic studies, it still supported the listing ofcreosote under section 313.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Statutory Findings</ITAG>After assessing public comment and the rulemaking record, EPA has determinedthat the chemical substances identified in Table 1 above (with the exceptionof diethylamine) meet the statutory toxicity criteria for listing undersection 313(d)(2) of EPCRA. These determinations and the specific toxiceffects of each chemical are set forth in detail in the preamble of theproposed rule and the accompanying rulemaking record.In summary, EPA finds that isosafrole, creosote, and dinitrotoluene (mixedisomers) are known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancerin humans. EPA has also determined that ortho-, meta-, and para-dinitrobenzeneare known or can reasonably be anticipated to cause serious reproductivedysfunctions in humans. EPA has determined that there is sufficient evidencethat allyl alcohol and 2,3-dichloropropene are known to cause or can reasonablybe anticipated to cause serious chronic health effects in humans. Finally,EPA concludes that mixed isomers of toluenediisocyanate causes or can reasonablybe anticipated to cause serious or irreversible chronic effect in humans.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Guidance for Reporting Creosote</ITAG>Estimating releases of creosote for purposes of section 313 should be basedon the total organics attributable to creosote that are released to eachmedium. Contributions to the release not known to be due to creosote perse can be factored out. For example, total organics might include amountsof pentachlorophenol from other processes at the facility which shouldbe subtracted. Fugitive emissions, solid wastes, and storage tank lossesmay be partially due to solvents, such as topped coal tar distillate, inthe mixture and these releases can be factored out using weight fractionsof these other substances.For air releases, fugitive emissions from equipment leaks such as pumpsand valves can be estimated by using the average Synthetic Organic ChemicalManufacturing Industry (SOCMI) emission factors for heavy liquid organics.If the facility had screening data for hydrocarbon leaks (defined as greaterthan 10,000 ppm) then this data can be used in conjunction with the leakingand non-leaking SOCMI fugitive emission factors. These fugitive emissionfactors are available in Appendix D of Estimating Releases and Waste TreatmentEfficiencies for the Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Form, EPA 560/4-88-002.Stack releases of creosote can be based on measured total volatile organicsor hydrocarbons. Air emissions for storage tanks can be estimated withEPA published equations using the average molecular weight and vapor pressurefor the creosote liquid at the storage temperature. If the molecular weightand vapor pressure of the creosote is not available, it can be calculatedusing the liquid concentration, molecular weight, and vapor pressure ofthe individual components. This procedure is further described in AppendixC of EPA 560/4-88-002.For water releases, estimates can be based on the measured total organicconcentration in wastewater times the wastewater volume. If this is notavailable, the concentration could be based on the solubility of creosotein water. Solid wastes should be based on the measured weight or volume(multiplied times density) of the creosote waste.As an alternative approach, a facility could build its estimates on a chemical-by-chemicalbasis, including at a minimum, the 20 most abundant constituents of creosote.However, a covered facility would not be required to file separate reportsfor anthracene, dibenzofuran, or napthalene based on their presence increosote.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Rulemaking Record</ITAG>The record supporting this rule is contained in the docket number OPTS-400021Aand in the CERCLA dockets referenced in Table 1. Nonconfidential documents,including an index of the docket, are available to the public in the TSCAPublic Docket Office from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excludinglegal holidays. The TSCA Public Docket Office is located at EPA Headquarters,Rm. NE-G004, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC. The CERCLA dockets which arepart of this rulemaking are available to the public in the CERCLA PublicDocket Office which is located at EPA Headquarters, Rm. M2427, 401 M St.,SW., Washington, DC.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Assessment Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires each Federal agency to classify as``major'' any rule likely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets.EPA's economic analysis estimates up to 619 additional reports entailingannual costs to EPA, industry, and States of about $755,000 as a resultof the addition of nine chemicals to the section 313 list of toxic chemicals.EPA anticipates that this addition will not have a significant effect oncompetition, costs, or prices. Therefore, EPA has determined that thisrule is not ``major.''This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by E.O. 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency toperform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likelyto have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.''40 CFR part 372 exempts certain small businesses from reporting; specifically,those facilities with fewer than 10 full-time employees. This exclusionexempts about one-half of all manufacturing facilities in Standard IndustrialClassification (SIC) codes 20 through 39 from section 313 reporting. EPAestimates that the addition of 9 chemicals will require reporting fromless than 1 percent of manufacturing facilities with between 10 and 50employees.The analysis supporting this rule anticipates that no segment of the manufacturingsector is likely to suffer significant adverse effects because of thisrule. Reporting costs are estimated at less than 0.25 percent of mediansales per report for affected facilities with 10 to 19 full-time employeesin manufacturing SICs 20 through 39. Based on the 9 chemicals, it is unlikelythat any facilities with 10 to 19 employees will have to file reports formore than 1 chemical.Therefore, EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities and that no Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis is needed.C. Paperwork Reduction ActOMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in thisrule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3> and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0093.The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 33 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 726 Jackson PlaceNW., Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 372</ITAG>Community right-to-know, Environmental protection, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Toxic chemicals.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 28, l989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6"> William F.
