Vietnam said the withdrawal marked the end of its militaryinvolvement in Cambodia, but guerrillas claim thousands ofVietnamese soldiers remain, wearing Cambodian uniforms.   Schoolchildren, peasants and city dwellers lined Highway 1,waving flags and tree branches at the thousands of passing troopsin a government-orchestrated welcoming ceremony.   ``My wife is more beautiful now than ever,'' one soldier said ashe held hands with his spouse, who dashed the last few yards toembrace her husband.   Vietnam had promised it would have all of its 26,000 troops outof Cambodia by Sept. 26, and the withdrawal sparked fears thatCambodia will slide into protracted civil war as government troopstry to fight the three-party guerrilla coalition without Vietnamesehelp.   Vietnam's invasion in December 1978 ousted the Khmer Rougeregime, which had ruled Cambodia since 1975. During that time, theKhmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands, practicing a radicalbrand of agrarian communism. Now the Khmer Rouge is the strongestof the three-party guerrilla front.   Guerrilla radio reports monitored in Bangkok on Tuesday claimedresistance forces had seized two more areas in a gem-rich region inwestern Cambodia, killing some Vietnamese troops in the fighting.   Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Banh recently confirmed thatguerrillas held some areas near Pailin.   At Moc Bai, a Vietnamese cultural troop serenaded hundreds ofsoldiers with popular tunes as they sat in a football-field sizebuffer zone between the two countries. Several military officersgave patriotic speeches, praising the ``solidarity of theVietnamese and Cambodian peoples.''   Then, with the whine of a motorcycle siren, the convoy began.   Led by an American-made jeep and Soviet-made armored personnelcarriers, the soldiers scurried into trucks and roared home,followed by trucks of their comrades.   ``I am so happy to be leaving Cambodia,'' a soldier from Can Thoprovince said as his 3-year-old daughter tugged at his hair.   Many men said they were worried that after receiving a hero'swelcome, they will have trouble finding jobs. Hanoi has demobilizedmore than a half-million soldiers in recent years, Gen. Tran CongMan, editor of Vietnam's official army newspaper, said in a recentinterview with The Associated Press. Unemployment is also high.   Freshly painted posters praising Vietnam's army lined Highway 1.The narrow, potholed highway was one of the main invasion routesused by Vietnamese troops almost 11 years ago when they poured intoCambodia.   In addition to the 10,000 troops at Moc Bai, Vietnamese soldierscrossed over at port towns on the Mekong River and at several otherlocations overland. Logistics and artillery divisions, along withwounded soldiers, crossed the border at Samat, several miles northof Moc Bai. Tanks and armored personnel carriers arrived at theport town of Rach Gai.   Outside of Moc Bai, the convoy stopped and started as localvillagers crowded around the trucks to cheer the soldiers.   At Go Dau, a toothless farmer ran to one truck and tossed thesoldiers packets of rice and pork wrapped in banana leaves.   ``Thank you, grandfather,'' one soldier said. Many of the troopshad spent the night on Highway 1, sleeping under trucks.   State-run television Tuesday night devoted a lengthy program tothe pullout as did the newspaper of the Vietnamese Communist Party.In an editorial the paper said Vietnam's ``special'' relationshipwith Cambodia would continue. Cambodian resistance groups haveclaimed Vietnam wants to colonize Cambodia.   In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamese government officials confirmedthat Vietnam and Cambodia would renegotiate their treaty of ``peaceand friendship,'' imposed on the Cambodian government soon after itwas installed in Phnom Penh.   The treaty, which is basically a mutual defense pact, conflictswith Cambodia's stated goal of neutrality. Cambodian Prime MinisterHun Sen had earlier said he hoped the treaty would be renegotiatedsoon.   However, the officials said such renegotiation would not affectVietnamese military support of the Phnom Penh government. They saidsuch support, through arms transfers, advice and intelligence,would last as long as nations such as China and Thailand continueto support the guerrilla resistance front. The Soviet Union isCambodia's main arms supplier.</TEXT></DOC>
