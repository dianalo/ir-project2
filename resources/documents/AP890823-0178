Pinochet also said the military, after leaving power in March,will not accept ``reprisals'' _ apparently prosecution of militaryofficials _ for human rights violations.   He said the winner of the December presidential election shouldanswer his demands before the change of government.   In a speech marking his 16th anniversary as army commander, the73-year-old military leader said the future civilian government willhave to accept a still-prominent role for the armed forces.   The improvement of relations between civilians and military willdepend ``on the total acceptance'' of his demands, Pinochet said.   Pinochet, who spoke to hundreds of military officers andgovernment officials at the Military Academy, made clear that hisdemands were discussed with commanders of the other services.   He was appointed army commander on Aug. 23, 1973 by civilianPresident Salvador Allende. Nineteen days later, Pinochet led thebloody military coup that toppled Allende, an avowed Marxist.   The demands listed by Pinochet included that he continue as armycommander, and that the chiefs of the air force, navy and nationalpolice also continue in their jobs. The demands fall under acontroversial constitutional clause that the opposition has promisedto change.   Other demands were that the powerful military courts remainunchanged, the armed forces be allowed to organize ranks and asevere anti-terrorist law be fully enforced.   Chile's next president will be chosen in an election scheduledfor Dec. 14 and will take office on March 11. The opposition'ssingle candidate, Patricio Aylwin, a centrist, is widely favored todefeat the government candidate Hernan Buchi.   Pinochet was obliged to call the election after losing areferendum last October on a proposal to extend his rule until 1997.   Pinochet also said the armed forces ``will not tolerate any ofmembers being humilliated or mistreated for their actions, whichwere aimed at saving Chile.''   After seizing power, the armed forces launched a severerepression of Allende's supporters. Thousands were arrested and manywere killed, tortured or sent into exile.   The opposition has promised to look into human rights abuses andbring those responsible for them to trial.</TEXT></DOC>
