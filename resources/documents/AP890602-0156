But because of ``America's Most Wanted,'' a suspect in thedrug-related torture-slaying of 12 persons in Mexico was nabbed inArizona in April. Last month, an escapee from a California jailcharged with jewel theft and kidnapping was caught in Rapid City,S.D.   And this week, an 18-year search for John E. List, wanted inconnection with the shooting deaths of his mother, wife and threechildren in Westfield, N.J., ended in Richmond, Va., after the casewas featured on the Fox television program on May 21 and promptedsome 300 phoned-in tips.   This ratings mainstay of the fledgling Fox network has turned 22million Sunday viewers into bloodhounds, responding to televisedmug shots and dramatized re-enactments of crimes with up to 5,000phoned-in tips every week.   Since ``America's Most Wanted'' first aired 15 months ago, 79 ofthe 154 fugitives profiled have been captured, and 48 were thedirect result of viewer tips, said Michael Linder, the program'sexecutive producer.   TV fare like this is a long way from ``The Ed Sullivan Show,''the Sunday sine qua non of a generation ago. After 67 episodes,``America's Most Wanted'' has attracted both strong supporters anddetractors.   Citing the program's success in drawing attention to fugitives,Los Angeles County officials last February began circulatingdescriptions and photographs of wanted criminals among all countyemployees.   The FBI, despite initial skepticism, is now a firm supporter ofthe TV program and has cooperated with producers on a number ofcases, including the List case.   ``The FBI has told us that there is no way to estimate thenumber of Americans alive today because of `America's MostWanted,''' said Linder in an interview.   ``There is a benefit that goes beyond simply arrestingfugitives. These are among the nation's most violent criminals.Capturing them means prevention of murders and other seriouscrimes,'' he said.   The International Association of Chiefs of Police, in Arlington,Va., gave ``America's Most Wanted'' an ``excellence in media''award last October.   But the American Civil Liberties Union has raised questionsabout the program's fairness.   ``Our worry is that the program portrays the actual crime priorto an indictment or conviction in a way that suggests guilt,'' saidColleen O'Connor, national director of public education. ``It hasthe effect of validating the accusation. That could preempt theright to a fair trial in some cases.''   ``It would be one thing if the show only functioned like anelectronic post office billboard,'' she said. ``But it's quiteanother if the content of a program describes something as truethat could be debatable.''   Linder said his show has not proven prejudicial to criminaldefendants.   ``In every case that has gone to court, local prosecutors andlawyers have been able to agree on juries that hadn't see`America's Most Wanted,''' he said.   Others have questioned whether the program leads to neighborssnitching on neighbors, causing authorities to harass innocentpersons.   Replied Linder: ``We tell our viewers they can call anonymously.But fully 65 percent are willing to leave their numbers forfollowup by law enforcement investigators. People are not usingthis show to bother their neighbors.''</TEXT></DOC>
