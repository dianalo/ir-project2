The Kremlin's double-track approach seems aimed at wringingmaximum publicity benefits from the missile withdrawal, whileavoiding any commitment to the intermediate-range nuclear forces(INF) treaty before the U.S. Senate votes on its ratification.   The Soviets also have gone public in recent days withaccusations that the United States has designs to bust the treatyand that U.S. officials are trying to renege on agreements made atthe Washington summit in December.   Soviet President Andrei A. Gromyko took the rhetoric a stepfurther Thursday by claiming progress now depends exclusively onWashington in superpower negotiations seeking a 50 percent cut instrategic nuclear arms.   Gromyko told the Hungarian Parliament in a speech that whetherthose negotiations in Geneva succeed or fail ``will depend, ofcourse, on how seriously these talks are treated by the UnitedStates.''   The medium-range missile treaty signed Dec. 8 by PresidentReagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev already has been approved by theruling Communist Party Politburo, but will not go into effect untilit is formally ratified by the Supreme Soviet, the Sovietparliament.   Soviet officials acknowledge their reluctance to committhemselves to the treaty stems from Senate refusal to approve the1979 SALT-II treaty that set limits for strategic nuclear weapons.   Gromyko, who served as Soviet foreign minister for almost threedecades, indicated the Kremlin leadership feels speedy Senateaction now is necessary to keep up the momentum on arms control.   The world ``is awaiting the ratification of the Soviet-AmericanINF treaty,'' Gromyko said. ``It is important to avoid a slowingdown of the pace of advance in the talks on questions ofdisarmament.''   During Secretary of State George Shultz's visit to Moscow thisweek, the superpowers gave their negotiators one month to draftanti-cheating and other key provisions of a strategic arms pact.   Shultz told reporters it was ``extremely important'' to spur onwork in Geneva if Reagan and Gorbachev are to sign the treaty attheir fourth summit, planned for May or June in Moscow.   The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet, which rubber-stamps decisionsmade by the party leadership, has consigned the INF treaty to aspecial subcommittee. There has been no official mention of when itmay be ratified.   Meanwhile, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate ArmedServices Committee, has said the treaty, which bans missiles withranges from 300 to 3,400 miles, will not be ratified until hispanel finishes a line-by-line scrutiny of it.   Although the ratification process is out of the spotlight in theSoviet Union, the Kremlin has been loudly announcing its mostrecent moves on disarmament and casting doubts on the intentions ofthe U.S. government.   On Thursday, a train loaded with dismantled Soviet SS-12missiles left a town near Dresden, East Germany, for the SovietUnion, and Soviet troops at Hranice, Czechoslovakia, began removingshorter-range missiles stationed in there.   Withdrawal of the SS-12s, mandated by the INF treaty, is beingcarried out early as ``further evidence of the socialist countries'serious and responsible approach to the task of fully abolishingnuclear weapons,'' the official Soviet Tass news agency said.   Radio Moscow said in an international news broadcast that themissile pullback is ``widely viewed as a gesture of good willundertaken even before the Soviet-American treaty comes intoforce.''   However, Czechoslovakia's state-run CTK news agency quoted theSoviet commander in charge of the missiles as saying they would notbe destroyed until the treaty is approved. Soviet media did not saywhen the SS-12s would be eliminated.   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and other American officialshave said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization needs to modernizeits battlefield nuclear weapons to make up for the U.S.-builtweapons banned under the INF treaty.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov saidSunday, however, that those plans clash with the treaty and calledthem ``incompatible with the strengthening of European security.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   John-Thor Dahlburg, a correspondent for TheAssociated Press based in Moscow, and writes frequently onsuperpower relations and arms control issues.</TEXT></DOC>
