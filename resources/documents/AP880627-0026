The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the Health CareFinancing Administration was producing reports that ``were oftennot fully responsive to congressional needs, were frequently lateand were variable in their technical adequacy.''   The GAO, in a report issued Sunday, attributed some of theproblems to the lengthy review and revision process conducted byadministration policy makers both inside and outside the healthfield.   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the House GovernmentOperations subcommittee on human resources, said the report raisesserious questions about how important decisions affecting healthcare are made.   ``If policies are made on the basis of inadequate or misleadinginformation, or if the information needed is not provided on time,then we can expect health care to deteriorate,'' Weiss, whorequested the report, said in a statement.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Meese Is a Big Seller</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A slogan condemning Attorney General EdwinMeese III that has drawn the wrath of law enforcement officials isalso drawing big sales numbers at a bookstore in the nation'scapital that can't keep enough T-shirts with the logo in stock.   T-shirts with the colorful logo ``Experts Agree: Meese is aPig'' are the hottest-selling item ever stocked by the CommonConcerns bookstore, manager David Marcuse says. He estimated thatabout 1,000 of them have been sold so far.   The T-shirts are produced by a group of punk rock musicians andfans who say they got into the business after they were arrestedfor putting up posters with the ``Meese is a Pig'' slogan in placeswhere no posting is allowed.   Group members say they decided to sell T-shirts to get out theirmessage in another way and to raise money to cover their legalexpenses.   ``We weren't intending to become a T-shirt fashion fad,'' saidMark Andersen, spokesman for the group.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Record Solar Disturbances Possible</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration says increased sunspot activity in the next fewyears could lead to the most intense solar disturbances everrecorded.   Such intense disturbances can have serious effects, includinginterfering with broadcasting, damage to sensitive electronicsystems in satellite and disturbances in electrical power andtelephone transmissions.   The NOAA said Sunday they have detected increased sunspotactivity recently, signalling solar activity that some scientistshave speculated can affect the climate on Earth.   Changes in rainfall patterns have occurred roughly in parallelwith changes on the sun over the years. However, proving that thetwo are connected has, so far, eluded science.   Sunspots occur in cycles of approximately 11 years.Climatologists have found slight variations in rainfall patterns inthe United States over periods of 11 years in the central andwestern states and over 22 years in the eastern states.   The current cycle began in September 1986 and already has seenrecord rates of increase in sunspots and radiation from the sun,according to Gary Heckman, head of the NOAA-Air Force SpaceEnvironment Services Center in Boulder, Colo.</TEXT></DOC>
