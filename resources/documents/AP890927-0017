Nearly three-fourths of the world's coarse grains _ corn,barley, sorghum, oats and rye _ are grown in the United States,Soviet Union, European Economic Community, China and Eastern Europe.   The United States alone produces about 30 percent of the total,mostly as corn, which as a livestock ``feed grain'' is the mainingredient for producing meat, poultry and dairy products forAmerican consumers.   One of the U.S. goals in the current Uruguay Round ofnegotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is toeventually eliminate agricultural trade barriers, includingsubsidies that would impair free trade.   The report, one of a series by the department's EconomicResearch Service, is in the October issue of Agricultural Outlookmagazine.   ``While there are adjustment costs involved in moving away fromprotectionism, both theory and research results suggest that thebenefits of free trade outweigh the costs,'' the report said. ``Butbecause there never has been free trade in agriculture, thefindings in these articles are, of necessity, speculative.''   If the move toward free trade is successful, it ``would push upthe volume of world coarse grain trade and increase grain prices,''the report said.   ``U.S. exports likely would increase in response to risingdemand,'' the report said. ``In turn, market receipts for U.S.producers would go up as world prices rose.''   However, it added, total returns to farmers would decline,including losses in government payments _ unless some kind of``decoupled'' income support was provided.   Coarse grain production in the United States would probablyincrease as much of the land idled under annual federal acreageprograms returned to production, the report said. And U.S.livestock producers would likely boost output to help fill a risingworld demand for meat.   ``World meat consumption would go up as the EEC and Japanremoved trade barriers, which would lower their domestic consumermeat prices,'' the report said. ``More U.S. livestock productionwould boost the demand for U.S. coarse grains.''   As a result of a move away from protectionism, world coarsegrain production ``would shift away from inefficient producers tomore efficient ones,'' the report said. That would occur withinindividual countries as well as around the world.   ``The U.S., Argentina and Thailand, all efficient producers,probably would increase output,'' the report said. ``However,production likely would decline in the EEC, Japan and Taiwan.''   Over the long haul, coarse grain production probably wouldincrease because of the rise in world livestock prices. The reportassumed that the rise in meat demand and prices would be triggeredby a growing population and rising incomes, particularly in theThird World.   ``Because of lower domestic coarse grain prices, EEC farmersprobably would reduce production,'' the report said. ``But the sizeof the adjustment would depend on how relative prices changed andhow much land went out of production.''   Livestock producers in the EEC would increase their feeddemands, which could force the 12-nation trading bloc into becominga net importer of coarse grains once again.   China, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe _ the other majorproducers of coarse grains _ probably will not participate in thisround of GATT trade reform, the report said.   As it is now, the United States, EEC, Argentina, Canada, China,Australia, Thailand and South Africa account for more than 90percent of the world's coarse grain exports. The U.S. share was 55percent in the 1985-87 period.   Some of the major exporters also are importers, and there havebeen shifts. For example, the report said, since 1985 the EEC andChina have changed from being net importers to net exporters.   The biggest coarse grain importers include Japan, EEC, SovietUnion, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan, Eastern Europe andMexico. These account for nearly three-fourths of the world totalcoarse grain imports.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of miles of track cast off by thebig railroad companies are a growing part of the ruraltransportation network as local or regional systems, says anAgriculture Department report.   Martin ``Buzz'' Fitzpatrick, administrator of the department'sOffice of Transportation, said Tuesday the number and mileage ofsmall railroads began to increase in the 1970s but gained a fullhead of steam in the mid-1980s.   ``However, future growth in the local and regional railroadmovement probably will be determined by the outcome of courtrulings as to the rights of rail labor in branch line sales and intransactions that create new railroads,'' he said.   Since the Staggers Act of 1980, which eased the way for the bigcompanies to sell off unprofitable branch lines, nearly 200 newsmall railroads have been formed, the report said. A fifth of theseare owned by shippers.   ``Local and regional railroads now operate over approximately 15percent of the nation's rail system, or 30,000 miles, and employ30,000 people,'' the report said. ``Last year, these carriersgenerated $1.5 billion in revenues.''   Small railroads include local freight lines that earn less than$20 million annually and operate less than 350 miles of track.Regional freight lines earn between $20 million and $87 millionannually and operate at least 350 miles of track.   The report said that as much as 25,000 additional miles of railline is expected to be cast off by the bigger Class I railroadsbefore they are finished with restructuring plans. Eighteenthousand miles are to be sold to small railroads over the next twoyears.</TEXT></DOC>
