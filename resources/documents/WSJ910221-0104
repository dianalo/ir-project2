Stertz   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/21/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   GM C LABOR</CO><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)</IN><LP>   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Workers at one of Chrysler Corp.'stwo St. Louis assembly plants selected a three-shift workschedule that will allow the auto maker to build an extra50,000 minivans a year.   But depressed auto sales will prevent Chrysler officialsfrom taking advantage of the added production that they'vebeen trying to get for more than two years. Instead, thecompany said it will indefinitely delay the start of a thirdshift until conditions in the U.S. auto market improve.</LP><TEXT>   Winning the flexibility to build more of the profitableminivans was the main reason Chrysler executives said theyaccepted a costly new contract with the United Auto Workersunion last fall. A three-shift system would sharply boostprofits by providing extra vehicle production without thehuge expense of building new factories or expanding existingones.   Under that contract, the UAW agreed to have hourly workersat the St. Louis plant choose among three options to addproduction without expanding the plant. Earlier this month,UAW Local 110 members elected to work in three seven-hourshifts for five days a week. They had been working under amore traditional schedule of two eight-hour shifts five daysa week, with overtime regularly tacked on weekdays andweekends.   When the third shift starts at the minivan plant, Chryslerwill recall about 1,000 of the 1,900 assembly workers laidoff from a nearby car-assembly plant that the auto maker willpermanently close this year. Bringing back the workers wasthe primary reason Chrysler managed to reclaim, in its 1990fourth-quarter earnings, $63 million of the $577 millioncharge taken a year earlier to cover plant closing costs.   No U.S. auto assembly plants have tried to operate withthree shifts. Critics say the additional work leaves littletime for maintenance and causes equipment to wear out faster.   The practice, however, is used successfully in Europe by afew auto makers, including General Motors Corp. GM is nownegotiating with the UAW to use a three-shift or similarschedule at its Lordstown, Ohio, plant, which makes theChevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird compact cars. Even inthe current depressed car market, the Lordstown plant hasworked overtime in some recent weeks because those models areselling relatively well.</TEXT></DOC>
