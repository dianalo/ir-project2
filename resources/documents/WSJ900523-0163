Deere attributed its second-quarter and year-to-dateimprovements to increased sales, higher production volumesand improved operating efficiency in the company's NorthAmerican operations. The company also noted that thesix-month results last year were adversely affected by themanufacturing start-up costs of new combines and largetractors.   &quot;North American agricultural conditions continue to befavorable, and our outlook for retail sales of John Deereagricultural equipment remains positive,&quot; the company said.   The company said that improved moisture conditions shouldstimulate demand for lawn and grounds-care equipment. Outsidethe U.S. and Canada, the company said, retail sales of JohnDeere farm equipment are expected to be &quot;modestly&quot; higherthis year.   Due to increased interest rates and slower constructionactivity, particularly in the eastern United States andCanada, the company said the outlook for North Americanretail sales of John Deere industrial equipment has become&quot;cautious.&quot;   The company said its &quot;overall outlook&quot; for the remainderof the year looks positive, but inflation and pricecompetition demands cost-control efforts and improvedoperating efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
