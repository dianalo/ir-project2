Klein</HL><DATE>05/18/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A8</SO><LP>   Chesapeake, Va. -- Dale Eggeling, who makes her living onthe Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, has some tipsfor how you golfers out there might improve your games. Shesays you should keep your heads down, bring your clubs backlow and slow, and have a baby.   OK, I know that some of you, especially you men, mighthave trouble following all of her advice. Nevertheless, the36-year-old pro, a sun-tanned brunette who laughs easily,says it is heartfelt and backed by results.</LP><TEXT>   Before she gave birth to Dustin Elias E. on March 1, 1988,Eggeling's best money-winning year in her 14 on the LPGA tourwas 1982, when she earned $57,691. But she nearly equaledthat last year, and with this year scarcely one-third gone,she's already pocketed $67,887, including her largest singlecheck -- $27,750 for finishing second in the Oldsmobile LPGAClassic in Lake Worth, Fla., in February. She's 14th on thetour's current list, her highest position ever.   &quot;People ask me what's my secret. I tell them there is none-- it's just that I've grown up a lot these past coupleyears,&quot; said Eggeling during last week's Crestar Classichere. &quot;Having a baby changed my whole perspective. Somethingwas always missing from my life, and I never knew what itwas. Now I have it.   &quot;I'm more responsible and spending my time better. I'mfocused and really practicing for the first time. It'sshowing up in my scores, and -- you know what? -- it actuallyseems kind of easy. I should have thought of it long ago.&quot;   Eggeling's paean to motherhood is swelling throughout theLPGA's ranks. Time was when moms were about as rare aspedal-pushers in women's golf, but now quite a few playersqualify. The tour counts 17 regulars who travel with theirkids much of the time. To its &quot;official&quot; hairspray, shampoo,anti-perspirant and beautician-image consultant, the LPGA hasadded an official child-care provider. That's Kinder-CareLearning Centers Inc., whose branches provide free pickup anddelivery for golfers' tots at tournament sites.   The tour's most illustrious mom is Nancy Lopez. An LPGAHall of Fame member at age 33, she has won 42 tour events, 15of which have come after the birth of her first child in1983. She and husband Ray Knight, the ex-baseball player,have two children, Ashley, 6, and Erinn, almost 4.   Laura Baugh just gave birth to a daughter, Haley, makingher the LPGA's fertility champ among active orsoon-to-be-active players with three children. Cathy Gerringshares with Eggeling 1990's &quot;most-improved&quot; title. The motherof a 20-month-old, she has jumped from 90th on the money listlast year to 12th currently, with winnings of $78,470.   Needless to say, being a mom on the golf tour ain't allbaby powder and cuddles. Gerring says that sleepless nightscaused by her son Zachary's ear infections, caused her tomiss the cuts in 10 of her first 11 tournaments last year.&quot;When you're practicing, you feel you should be with yourchildren, and when you're with your children, you feel youshould be practicing,&quot; testifies Baugh.   It helps to have a husband in the business, or, at least,along for the ride. Moms Baugh, Gerring, Juli Inkster andJudy Dickinson all are married to golf pros who sometimesaccompany them on the links. Cathy Reynolds's husband, DanaDeroux, is her caddy. Myra Blackwelder's husband, Worth, isInkster's caddy. How's that for a potential conflict ofinterest?   Dale Eggeling's hubby, Mike, also is a LPGA tourist. Hetravels the circuit on behalf of Taylor Made Golf, a clubmaker whose products Dale uses. The two met in 1975 at theUniversity of South Florida, where Dale played on the women'sgolf team and Mike was captain of the men's unit. He, too,turned pro after leaving school and tried twice withoutsuccess to qualify for the PGA tour.   &quot;We took stock and decided to put all our eggs in whatseemed to be our best basket, which was my career,&quot; saysDale. &quot;Mike's been great about it.&quot;   After a few lean years getting started, Eggeling has beena steady if not spectacular performer, with average annualwinnings of about $45,000. She's won just one tourney, a l980event in Boston, and says that it was so long ago that aboutall she remembers about it was that she was ill with walkingpneumonia.   She notes that she had an infection that caused her rightknee to swell during her two best 1990 showings -- the secondat Lake Worth and a third place the next week at the Phar-MorInverrary Classic in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., at which sheearned $21,666, and wonders if there's a connection.   &quot;Lately, when Mike asks how I feel and I say `Fine,' hesays, `Too bad,'&quot; she smiles.   Unlike some LPGA parents, the Tampa, Fla.-based Eggelingsdon't travel by van, choosing planes and hotels even thoughthey're more expensive. &quot;I enjoy having someone make up myroom,&quot; Dale notes. Mike's mother sometimes accompanies themas a baby sitter, and they've also used take-along nanniesand commercial day care. They pitch in, too, of course.   &quot;Don't let anybody kid you; no matter how much help youhave, motherhood is work,&quot; declares Dale.   But she goes on that less time has, for her, been more.&quot;Mike and I used to have a lot of `lazy time,' but we suredon't any more, and we've had to cut back on hobbies andsocial things that were distracting,&quot; she says. &quot;Now, whenI'm at a tournament, that's where my mind is.&quot;   The sweetest fruit of Eggeling's new regime came in herFebruary finishes. She shot final rounds of 67 and 69 to tiePat Bradley for the 72-hole lead at the Oldsmobile beforelosing in a playoff, and the next week, at the Inverrary,started off with rounds of 69 and 68.   Eggeling promised to buy Dustin a gift every time shebroke 70, and admits to being hard-pressed during her streak.&quot;I got him an outfit after the 67 and a toy after the 69, butthe next week I gave him IOUs until we got home,&quot; she says.&quot;When you travel, you can't lug too much stuff.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
