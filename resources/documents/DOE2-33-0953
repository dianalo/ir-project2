Essentialexpenditure on research and development is being devoted mainly to thefield of gasification and gas cleaning. An unavoidable prerequisite fora decision on whether to apply this technology on a large engineeringscale, is that the gasifier and the associated gas cleaning equipmenthave been proved in a demonstration plant to such a degree that a commercialcombined cycle power plant with integrated coal gasification is feasible.Finally the fuel gas price has to be determined on the basis of concretecapital and operating costs for the gasification route, including gascleaning, in order to be able to make a decision on the economics ofthe combined cycle power plant.</TEXT></DOC>
