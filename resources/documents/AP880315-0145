Roy Hofheinz, former mayor, county judge and prime mover behindconstruction of the stadium, built the six-story apartment,including a barber shop, game room, bowling alley, putting greensand a shooting gallery, not to mention a superb view of the playingfield.   Hofheinz died in 1982, and had not lived in his stadium homesince 1975. Much of it already has been converted to viewing areasand special viewing boxes. This week the rest will be torn down,and will become part of a new 15,000-seat area.   In Hofheinz's master bedroom and drawing room, there are 30-footceilings, gold-plated fixtures, handcarved woodwork and a bathroomwith sunken tub and sauna.   A slanting floor in the Tipsy Tavern gives guests a feelingbeing so before they take a drink. In the apartment's chapel,changeable windows offered worshipers their choice of a cross, aStar of David or a Buddhist symbol.   Hofheinz lived in the apartment off and on from 1965, when theAstrodome was built, to 1975. He died at age 70.</TEXT></DOC>
