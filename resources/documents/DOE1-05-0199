<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-05-0199 </DOCNO><TEXT>In FY 1985 a 1,000m class well (BS-1) was drilled and the preliminarysurvey was started in order to confirm the conditions indicating theexistence of reservoir in the Hohi-Sugabaru Region, the typical regionfor the middle and high temperature hot water resources. During the steamextraction test at the well BS-1, the inlet pressure was 4.6kg/cm{sup2}, the amount of steam was about 33t/h and the hot water of about 126t/hgushed out. As the result, the hot water of 190-210`C was confirmed,but the temperature of the reservoir remained as cool as about 20-30`C.If the reservoir temperature drops by about 10`C as the continuous extractionand reinjection of hot water are done due to electricity generation,it is expected that no steam outlet necessary for the power generationbe obtainable. Accordingly, taking into consideration also the environmentaladaptability such as the scaling problem, development of the binary cyclepower generation system adopting downhole pumps capable for coping withthis problem becomes necessary in the Hohi Region.
