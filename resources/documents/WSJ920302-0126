Mr. Paul and other defendants named in the 22-countindictment allegedly used the fraudulent securities purchasein 1988 to try to conceal CenTrust's perilous financialcondition from regulators. The indictment charged thatanother person involved in the conspiracy to cover upproblems at CenTrust was Ghaith Pharaon, an alleged front manfor BCCI, the international bank that collapsed last yearafter being seized by regulators from several countries. BCCIwas controlled by BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A.</LP><TEXT>   The goal of the conspiracy, according to the indictment,was to make it appear that there was investor interest inCenTrust at a time that regulators were investigatingallegations of false internal accounting by the thrift.CenTrust eventually repurchased the securities for more thanBCCI had paid, the indictment said, and Mr. Pharaon allegedlykept the difference of $331,500.
