Following a prolonged and often bitter discussion, the bill failed on a procedural issue. Passage would have required 60 of the 100 senators' assent to waive budget limits set forth in a resolution earlier this year, but the vote fell three short.    The compromise measure, hammered out in conference committee, was adopted by the House last week. Yesterday's defeat came amid increasing congressional sensitivity about federal deficits and the budget talks going on simultaneously in the Capitol.    Supporters, who hoped for quick passage of the measure, charged that a small group of GOP lawmakers used the budget talks as an excuse to derail a bill they simply oppose. Supporters also argued that, although the bill would entail spending an estimated $47 million over the budget limits, that excess amount would be eliminated in a subsequent measure to generally reduce the budget.    Lawmakers also clashed on the ultimate costs of the bill; supporters cited Congressional Budget Office figures putting it at $30.6 billion over two years, while the Reagan administration, which has strenuously opposed the bill, said it could cost much more.    While yesterday's vote raises the prospect that a housing bill may not be enacted this year, all the existing programs will likely continue; most have been operating under stopgap legislation for the past seven years.    &quot;People were too sensitive about being charged with budget busting,&quot; complained Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), chairman of the Senate's housing subcommittee and a lead sponsor of the bill. He argued that the defeat wasn't related to what he said was strong, underlying support for the bill, an earlier version of which passed the Senate in March by a margin of 71-27.    &quot;People who would support the bill were reluctant to vote to waive the budget act,&quot; he said. He said certain senators were particularly vulnerable to criticisms that they were acting irresponsibly regarding the deficit.    But opponents of the measure argued that the bill does indeed raise spending at a time the nation can ill afford it.    &quot;You can't get around the fact that this bill is an absolute budget buster -- in the midst of a budget crisis -- in the name of housing reform,&quot; shouted Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), the ranking GOP member of the committee and one of the GOP lawmakers who blocked the bill.    The measure, the first bill specifically for housing authorization to reach the Senate floor in seven years, would essentially maintain current housing and community development programs for two years. Supporters say the funding, estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at $15 billion the first year and $15.6 billion the second, would trim spending slightly below current levels; the Reagan administration's budget analysts maintain it would cost at least $19 billion the first year.    If adopted, the measure also would eliminate the need for annual authorization of the Federal Housing Administration's popular mortgage insurance programs, such as the one that aids first-time and low-income home buyers by guaranteeing mortgages. On Sunday, operating authority for the programs expired for the second time this year; the president yesterday signed a measure extending them until Dec. 2. Both supporters and opponents of the bill said they hope to resolve their differences in time to avoid another shutdown.    It's unclear when the Senate will next take up the measure. A parliamentary move by Sen. Cranston brought the original bill back before the Senate. GOP opponents, led by William Armstrong (R., Colo.), said they would bring a substitute to the floor in several days, removing features they find most objectionable. If that move fails, they said they will seek to amend the original bill to accomplish the same objective.    Sen. Cranston said he also would try to amend the bill to remove grounds for a procedural move like the one that blocked passage yesterday.    That measure also would have created a new housing program to subsidize home purchases by low-income buyers in devastated areas, and establish new rules to avoid displacement of low-income renters by federally funded community development projects.    But those are among the provisions that have been most strongly opposed by the Reagan administration. The White House has said that President Reagan will veto the bill.    The bill does contain measures the administration supports, however, including the expansion of a project to allow public housing residents to manage and eventually purchase their homes. </TEXT></DOC>
