Gorbachev's pledge towithdraw forces from Eastern Europe.   In a speech Dec. 7 at the United Nations, the Soviet leaderpromised to reduce military forces by half a million in two yearsand pull 50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks out of East Germany,Czechoslovakia and Hungary.   Gorbachev's commitment was seen as a boost to East-West talks inVienna on reducing conventional forces in Europe, which could beginby March.   Col.-Gen. Ferenc Karpati, the defense minister, said in atelevision interview Tuesday the preparations for withdrawing someof the 62,000 Red Army troops from Hungary were nearly complete. Hesaid an armored division was among the units scheduled to leave.   The official news agency MTI quoted Communist Party chief KarolyGrosz as telling the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai the pullout``is to commence within weeks,'' but neither he nor Karpati gave adate.   Karpati refused to name a date when asked later by an AssociatedPress reporter. He said the Gorbachev speech indicated withdrawalwould be more likely late this year, but ``it could also be ashorter period (sooner). The preparatory work is ending.''   He would not answer a question about whether a symbolicwithdrawal of a small force might come before the Vienna talks onconventional forces begin.   The defense minister said pulling out some Red Army forces was a``political step ... intended to show the world the Soviet Union isnot insisting on the idea of having troops in these countries.''   Hungary, a leading proponent of reform in the Soviet bloc, haswelcomed Gorbachev's plans for reduced defense spending andpolitical liberalization.   In the Hungarian parliament Tuesday, members debated two new lawson freedom of assembly and association that should give citizens theright to hold demonstrations and form independent organizations andpolitical parties.   Several deputies objected to a provision in the bill onassociations that, in effect, would prevent political parties frombeing active until next year.   Votes were scheduled for Wednesday.   Dozens of independent political groups have sprung up in recentmonths, many with specific platforms. At least two are full-fledgedparties and want to enter candidates in the 1990 elections.   Frigyes Puja, a former foreign minister voicing the reservationsof more conservative Communists, asked that reference to ``politicalparties'' be removed and a separate statute regulating parties bepassed next year.   Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said in the debate the rights ofassociation and assembly are ``inalienable.'' He also outlined plansto make Hungary the second nation in the Soviet bloc after Poland toallow an alternative to compulsory military service.   Karpati said in the TV interview the alternative-service programshould become law by midyear. About 100 Hungarians are in jail forrefusing to serve the required 18 months in the army.   Poland and Hungary have serious economic problems, includinglarge debts to Western banks, and are reducing their defensebudgets. After Gorbachev promised the Soviet troop withdrawals,Karpati announced cuts in defense spending for 1989 of 17 percent inreal terms.   In a speech made public over the weekend, Gorbachev saidpreliminary study had shown Soviet defense spending could be reducedwithout endangering security.   Hungary pioneered economic reform in the Soviet bloc during the1960s, but stalled in the 1970s. Grosz is promoting market-orientedchanges in hopes of improving the economy and reducing the $17billion foreign debt, highest per capita in the Eastern bloc.   Price increases for many foodstuffs took effect Monday. Thousandsof workers in northeastern Hungary held a 10-minute warning strikeand official trade unions demanded wage hikes to catch up.   Statistics published Tuesday said 2.6 million of Hungary's 10.6million people were officially classified as poor in 1987. Nofigures are available for 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
