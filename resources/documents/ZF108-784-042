 On your desk are a fewdozen pictures from your scanner.andP;  But your vector-based drawing programcan't modify or edit these bitmapped images.andP;  So how can you fit thebitmapped peg into the vector hole?andP;  The answer is an autotracing program,which converts the groups of pixels that make up a bitmapped image into themanipulable &quot;objects&quot; that make up a vector image.andM;Until a few years ago you had to trace bitmapped images over by hand beforeyou could use them in your drawing program.andP;  Then some drawing programs addedtracing functions that let you select each of the separate shapes in abitmapped image for the program to trace.andP;  Last year, Adobe Streamline firstoffered true autotracing, in which you simply tell the program the name of abitmapped file and sit back as it traces the entire image by itself.andM;Today, many illustration programs come with full-featured autotracingprograms of their own, including some that can trace color images as well asblack and white.andP;  If that's the case, you won't need a standalone package;our testing showed the best of them (Micrografx Designer and Corel-DRAW) tobe just as good as or better than any standalone.andP;  But if your favoritedrawing package does not have good autotracing, Streamline and itscompetitor, QuickTrace, from Mitsubishi, are quality programs that will beable to fill in the gap for you.andM;IT'S ALL IN THE IMAGEandM;Tracing works by identifying groups of pixels that form lines or outlines andtranslating them into mathematically defined nodes and vectors.andM;This isn't as easy as it sounds.andP;  In fact, you will probably have to do aconsiderable degree of touching up in order to retain all the details of theoriginal.andP;  Here's why.andM;A bitmapped line in a scanned image is actually an irregular clump of pixels,and the tracing program has to determine the ideal centerline of thatirregular clump by a process of averaging that sacrifices detail.andP;  Theprogram has to decide whether to strip away one or more layers of possiblyextraneous pixels (which might be significant detail or just &quot;noise&quot;introduced by the scanner) from the outer edge of the clump before averagingthe remaining ones into a line that can be defined mathematically.andM;Prepare to make some tedious adjustments to the program's options before youget it right.andP;  You must decide which of two basic techniques the tracingprogram should use: the centerline method, which converts clumps of pixelsinto lines, or the outline method, which converts them into outlines.andP;  Withmost images, the choice between the two is clear.andP;  But some images require adelicate combination of the two methods, with clumps of pixels below acertain width converted into lines and clumps larger than that widthconverted into outlines.andM;Autotracing programs aren't perfect, but they work well enough to be a realhelp sometimes.andP;  They allow relatively unskilled users to include the kind ofgraphics into their presentations and desktop publications that couldotherwise be produced only by skilled artists.andP;  If you need the images andcan't draw them yourself, the time you spend adjusting the options for bestresults will be far outweighed by the time you save.andM;Adobe StreamlineandM;Adobe Systems' $395 Adobe Streamline was the first autotracing program thatlet you select an image and sit back while the program did all the dirty workof tracing it for you.andP;  Even with the increased competition from QuickTraceand the autotracing functions available in full-scale drawing packages,Streamline continues to hold its own as one of the most impressive performersin the field, although a somewhat pricey one.andP;  Since Streamline runs underWindows, you can easily switch back and forth between Streamline andWindows-based drawing programs such as CorelDRAW, Micrografx Designer, andAdobe Illustrator--the three programs to which it exports directly.andP;  Thelatest versions of CorelDRAW and Micrografx Designer already have excellentautotracing functions of their own, so if you use these, you don't needStreamline.andP;  But if you're using Adobe Illustrator, or working with filescreated by a very-high-resolution scanner, or simply converting bitmappedimages to vector-based .EPS, Streamline may be just what you need.andM;Few Windows applications are as straightforward to use as Streamline.andP;  Youselect one or more .PCX, TIFF, or MacPaint files from a menu, and the programdoes the rest.andP;  The screen shows the progress of the tracing by drawing theconverted image as you watch, and also by reporting the percentage ofcompletion.andP;  You can modify tracing and export options for individual filesor set permanent defaults that apply to all the files in the batch.andP;  If youdon't have enough expanded memory to convert a large image, or if you wantonly part of a scanned image, you can limit the conversion to a rectangularblock, which you select with the mouse.andM;HIGHLY TUNABLEandM;Streamline offers the two basic conversion methods, outline and centerline,plus a combined method that uses outline conversion for bitmapped regionsabove a specified thickness and centerline conversion for thinner regions.andO;Options for outline conversion include setting the &quot;noise&quot; level, which tellsthe program whether to trace or ignore stray pixels.andP;  Options for centerlineconversion include the number of pixels that the program strips frombitmapped lines before finding the average center of a line.andP;  You can alsochoose to convert white lines on a black background instead of the usualblack on white.andM;All three conversion methods can be fine-tuned to adjust the degree to whichthe converted image will match the fine details of the bitmap.andP;  You can alsoadjust the output so that it better reflects images that consist mostly oflong straight lines or short curved ones.andP;  You can choose to convert imagesonly into straight lines or only into curves.andP;  You can't select fillpatterns, though you can do this in your drawing program.andM;With irregular outlines, Streamline does a superb job.andP;  It sometimes hasslight difficulties making parallel lines come out parallel, and you'llprobably have to work to get the combination outline and centerline method toproduce manageable output.andP;  But if you're looking for an elegant,Windows-based program for autotracing alone, make a beeline for Streamline.andM;QuickTraceandM;Mitsubishi's $245 QuickTrace is high in speed and power, low in cost and RAMrequirements, and middling in the quality of its user interface.andP;  Like otherautotracing programs, it lets you choose a scanned bitmap image and modify afew options while the program does the conversion.andM;Unlike Streamline, QuickTrace uses DOS's 640K and nothing more; it doesn'tuse Windows or GEM or any other graphics-based interface.andP;  Within theselimits, the designers of QuickTrace evidently worked to rival Streamline andgenerally succeeded.andP;  Conversions tend to be faster than Streamline's, withequal or marginally superior results in PC Labs' tests.andP;  As in Streamline,some parallel lines come out less than parallel, but the effect is slight andinfrequent.andP;  QuickTrace lets you convert only TIFF files, not .PCX, and,unlike Streamline and the best drawing programs, doesn't let you select partof an image to trace.andM;Besides the standard outline and centerline tracing methods, QuickTraceoffers a method that it calls &quot;coloring&quot; because the results vaguely resemblea child's coloring book.andP;  Imagine a flag divided into three panels, with theleft and right panels shaded black and the middle one unshaded.andP;  With thiskind of image, the outline method generates a trace with only two objects: anouter, shaded one that corresponds to the two original outer panels and theconnecting lines above and below the central unshaded panel; and an inner,unshaded object that corresponds to the original center panel.andP;  But the&quot;coloring&quot; method creates three separate boxes corresponding to the originalthree panels, so later manipulation is far easier.andM;MANY OPTIONSandM;QuickTrace gives you a range of options for thinning thick lines and settingline widths, color and fill patterns, arc formats, and other details.andP;  As theprogram processes an image, it displays different colored lines to indicatethe kinds of curves being converted.andP;  (You lose this feature with VGAmonochrome.)andM;QuickTrace exports to .EPS, .CGM, and Micrografx .DRW formats.andP;  You cancreate .EPS files in standard or Adobe Illustrator format, or with an addedDOS header and TIFF image for previewing.andP;  Options for .CGM files tailor theoutput for the ANSI standard, or for Freelance Plus, PageMaker, Ventura, orWordPerfect.andP;  You can also export to Harvard Graphics, but because of thelimitations of that program, the resulting image will use only straightlines.andM;When buying QuickTrace, you must choose between three versions: the $245version for desktop publishing (the one we tested), the original $245 versionthat exports only to Freelance, or the $295 version for output to AutoCAD.andM;The clunkiest part of QuickTrace is its interface, which makes you specifydrives by pressing the Ins key and doesn't give you any first-lettershortcuts for navigating its menus.andP;  If you can live with these trivialinconveniences, you'll find that QuickTrace's speed and accuracy are wellworth its modest price.andM;Adobe StreamlineandM;Adobe Systems Inc., 1585 Charleston Rd., P.O.
