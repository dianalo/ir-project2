TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CANDA GOVMTENVIRONMENT (ENV)PETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel suggested that Canadians are advocating strong U.S. controls on acid rain and oppose oil development in an Alaskan refuge in order to make the U.S. more dependent on Canadian energy.    Mr. Hodel, meeting with reporters yesterday, called it &quot;astonishing&quot; that Canada had opposed oil exploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, adjacent to Canada on Alaska's North Slope. Canada's opposition, he said, continues a history in which &quot;Canadians have abused&quot; their influence in the U.S. &quot;for what I think is the furtherance of their own economic activity.&quot;    The interior secretary's statements are likely to exacerbate tensions between Canada and the U.S. on international trade and environmental protection.    Last month, Vice President George Bush attempted to soothe those tensions in a visit with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in Ottawa. But relations are likely to remain strained as President Reagan prepares to make his own visit to Ottawa April 5 and 6.    Mr. Hodel called Canada's opposition to oil development on the Arctic refuge &quot;absolutely an easy 'pro-environmental' position for them to take at no cost to them.&quot; Noting that Canada produces oil and natural gas, he added, &quot;to the extent to which they persuade us to blindfold ourselves as to our own resources, they put us in a position where we will be more dependent upon their resources at a higher price.&quot;    The secretary described Canadians' pressure for tighter U.S. acid-rain controls as &quot;their efforts to make it more costly and difficult to generate electricity in the U.S.&quot; Tough restrictions on U.S. electric plants, he said, would &quot;have the effect, whether it was their intention or not, of increasing the potential market for excess Canadian electricity in the U.S.&quot;    &quot;I hope,&quot; Mr. Hodel concluded, &quot;that the U.S. isn't so naive and foolish that we fall for that kind of doublespeak.&quot; While serving as energy secretary, Mr. Hodel opposed Canadian electricity imports into the Northeastern U.S., but the sales eventually were approved.    Jim Wright, head of the environment section at the Canadian Embassy here, dismissed Secretary Hodel's comments as part of a &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot; While calling the theory &quot;ridiculous,&quot; he said &quot;it is of concern to us when we hear it from senior representatives of the U.S. government.&quot;    Meanwhile, Canadians are complaining that the U.S. has failed to keep its commitments to fund clean coal-burning demonstration plants.    A report prepared by special envoys Drew Lewis of the U.S. and William Davis of Canada called for the U.S. to spend $1 billion a year for five years on certain kinds of demonstration projects, with half of the money to come from the federal government. The Reagan administration claims the U.S. will spend that amount.    But the U.S. counts research unrelated to the clean-coal projects. For the clean-coal projects, which are aimed at reducing acid rain, the federal government plans to spend a total of only $750 million. Canada contends that only $1.7 billion has been slated by the U.S. government and private sector combined for projects that meet the criteria in the report. </TEXT></DOC>
