The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said the penalties are the largest ever proposed against a construction firm. The agency began inspecting ABC Utilities after a company worker died March 23 when an unshored trench collapsed at a construction site at Azle, Texas.    Frank White, deputy assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said the company has consistently ignored federal rules regarding trenches, which the agency said are one of the most hazardous of construction operations. OSHA cited ABC Utilities in 1983 for trench-safety violations in connection with the death of another worker, and again in 1985 for similar violations.    Frank Wolfe, owner of closely held ABC Utilities, said he was &quot;shocked by the size of the fine and by their interpretation of what happened on the site.&quot; He said he plans to appeal the OSHA ruling. Mr. Wolfe said that in the incident under investigation, work had been halted to bring in shoring equipment and the employee who was killed had been told three times to leave the trench but failed to do so. </TEXT></DOC>
