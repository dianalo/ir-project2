Rather than hunt for reserves of premium light sweet crudeoil or low-priced but marketable natural gas, the maverickcompany is putting its entire exploration and developmentbudget into finding and producing the thick crude known asheavy oil. While a few companies are venturing timidly intoheavy-oil exploration and development, many Canadianproducers think CS is foolish to bet exclusively on thefuture of heavy crude.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Heavy oil is everywhere in Canada; you're tripping overit, not like in the U.S.,&quot; says Dennis Sharp, founder andpresident of CS Resources. &quot;Sure, it would be nice to be inlight crude or even producing natural gas, but this is a realopportunity and the future of the industry.&quot; Heavy oil's onlydirect use is making asphalt for roads and driveways, but thecrude can also be upgraded into a lighter oil, which can thenrefined into gasoline, heating oil and other products.   Mr. Sharp's view astonishes some of his colleagues in theoil industry. The price of heavy oil continues to languish ataround $14 a barrel, compared with about $23 a barrel forlight crude. (It costs about $5 a barrel, plus extensivecapital investment, to upgrade heavy crude to a lighter-gradeoil.) There's also an oversupply of the heavier oil, keepingprices low. Many Canadian producers this year have shut downproduction at their heavy-oil fields and deferred plans toproduce more.   David Claydon, chairman and chief executive officer of BPCanada Inc., a unit of British Petroleum PLC, said thecompany is unlikely to proceed with earlier plans to expandproduction at its Wolf Lake property. The site, a jointventure between BP Canada and state-controlled Petro-Canada,produces bitumen, an extremely heavy oil that can only beextracted after forcing steam into the field to liquefy theoil.   Right now, Mr. Claydon said, the two companies areproducing only enough bitumen to cover the costs of theproject. BP Canada, he says, plans to use its revenue fromthe production of lighter crude to finance natural gasexploration and development.   While CS Resources is unique in its single-minded pursuitof heavy oil, some companies are slowly beginning to developplans to exploit the resource. While the price for the thick,gooey oil has only improved slightly from record low levelsearly this year, producers and analysts say new technology ishelping to cut production costs and demand is starting torise.   Pentti Kerkkainen, an analyst with Midland Walwyn CapitalInc. in Calgary, says the advent of horizontal drilling hasmade the recovery of larger quantities of heavy oil moreeconomically feasible. As the term implies, a horizontal wellis drilled sideways through an area of oil-bearing rock,allowing the company to access more reserves than it can witha conventional vertical well.   &quot;With horizontal drilling, you can almost doubleproduction rates of heavy oil,&quot; Mr. Kerkkainen said; thatmakes it cheaper to produce each barrel of heavy crude.   William Trickett, president and chief executive ofCalgary-based Morgan Hydrocarbons Inc., says it costs hiscompany only three Canadian dollars (US$2.67) a barrel toproduce heavy oil from the horizontal wells it has drilled,compared with an average of C$4 a barrel for light crudeproduced from conventional vertical wells.   &quot;We made the decision two years ago to exploit our heavyoil reserves, when we realized there just wasn't that muchlight premium crude to be found any more,&quot; Mr. Trickett said.&quot;The investments in heavy oil and horizontal drilling arepaying off in spades.&quot;   Canada's National Energy Board calculated earlier thisyear that the country has about 41.6 billion barrels of lightoil that is ultimately recoverable. In contrast, ultimatelyrecoverable reserves of conventional heavy oil are 6.78billion barrels and of the very heavy bitumen 308.21 billionbarrels.   Another sign of hope for companies with reserves of heavyoil is a likely increase in demand from upgraders, whichconvert the thick crude into a lighter, more valuableproduct. Next year, demand for heavy crude from upgraders isexpected to increase by about 100,000 barrels daily as newupgrading capacity comes on stream in both the U.S. andCanada. That, producers say, will help to resolve an18-month-long oversupply problem that has plagued theindustry by helping to keep prices low.   &quot;By late 1992 or 1993, there might even be more demand{for heavy crude} than supply,&quot; said Gordon Willmon, managerof heavy oil for Imperial Oil Ltd.'s Esso Resources unit. Mr.Willmon said Esso is close to a decision to expand productionof bitumen at its Cold Lake, Alberta, facility, a projectthat was mothballed last year when prices dropped.   &quot;Prices aren't much better, but the outlook is better thanwe've seen in a while,&quot; said Mr. Willmon. Arden Haynes,chairman and chief executive of Imperial Oil, which is 70%owned by Exxon Corp., has said the company views heavy oil asits major upstream investment opportunity, and that thecompany is contemplating once again a decade-old plan tobuild an upgrader of its own, a project that would cost atleast $3 billion.   On a smaller scale, Saskatchewan Oil andamp; Gas Corp. isalready creating its own market. Earlier this year, Saskoilpaid C$8.4 million for a Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, asphaltplant. The facility uses heavy oil to make asphalt and isalso able to store 880,000 barrels of oil if the market pricefor the commodity declines.   &quot;We'd also like to see the Sarnia to Montreal pipelinereopened and dedicated to taking a heavier crude through torefineries in Quebec,&quot; he said. The pipeline, owned byInterprovincial Pipe Line Ltd. of Edmonton, was closedearlier this year.   Most analysts and industry experts agree that companiesseeking ways to produce heavy oil economically areconfronting an issue that the whole industry will have tocome to terms with this decade. Less and less valuable lightcrude is likely to be discovered, they say, whereas heavy oilremains relatively plentiful.   &quot;They're just leading the way,&quot; says Jim Doak, an analystwith First Marathon Securities Ltd. in Toronto. Mr. Doakpoints out that Esso Resources is already seeing a decline inits production of conventional light oil as its major fieldsare played out. &quot;They have to replace it with something tokeep cash flow and earnings up,&quot; he said.   In a report published this summer, Canada's NationalEnergy Board concluded that the proportion of heavy oil inCanada's total crude production will increase substantially.In 1990, the report said, 29% of crude produced in Canada washeavy grade, a figure the board expects to jump to 39% by2010.   &quot;The reality is that you can go out and look for light oiland you won't find much, but you'll find a lot of heavy,&quot;says Dan McNamara of the Canadian Petroleum Association, anindustry group. Prices may still be &quot;terrible,&quot; he adds, but&quot;folks will reduce their unit costs and figure out how tomake money.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
