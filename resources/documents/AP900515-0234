Boone Pickens that accuse the country'sbiggest automakers of colluding to keep consumer prices high andsome shareholder dividends low.   Pickens accused Toyota Motor Co. and its powerful advertisingagency Dentsu last week of attempting to block publication of theads, which contend that collusive business practices force higherprices on consumers. Toyota and Dentsu denied the allegations.   The takeover strategist charged that Toyota intervened becauseof his battle to exercise ownership rights in Koito ManufacturingCo., an auto lighting equipment maker close to Toyota. Pickens isthe largest stockholder in Koito.   The Asahi Shimbun, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun and the YomiuriShimbun, all major dailies, published identical ads from Pickens intheir Tuesday morning editions. None of the ads, which also blameJapan's big automakers for low returns to shareholders of autoparts companies, mentioned any automaker by name.   Pickens' lawyer, Kanji Ishizumi, said the ad as originallysubmitted named Toyota, Honda and Nissan Motor Co. as leaders ofseparate automobile keiretsu, or business groups, that force theirauto parts makers to sell parts at low prices.   However, Ishizumi said, he was forced to drop their namesbecause it was the only way to get the ads published.   Ishizumi said the fact that all three newspapers ran the same adon the same day illustrates the degree to which the move wascalculated after Pickens made his charges public.   ``After media coverage of the issue, the newspapers compromisedand printed the ads,'' Ishizumi said.   Pickens' laywer said he was disappointed the newspapers did notcomply with his request to run the ad on staggered days. ``It'slike fireworks, everyone will read the ad and forget about it atonce,'' he said.   ``The auto industry is booming, but because of the keiretsu webelieve auto parts makers are forced to sell their parts atinappropriately low prices to the makers,'' the published ads said.   ``We think the automakers, as a group, damage the profits ofauto parts makers and reduce the dividends of shareholders bybeating down the prices of auto parts,'' the ad said.   Last week, a representive of the Yomiuri Shimbun said the ad hadbeen rejected twice, but that the daily paper was considering usingthe ad if it dropped references to Toyota and Honda, two of thenewspaper's biggest advertising clients.   The paper was concerned the ad might confuse consumers, addedIkuo Terai of the Yomiuri's advertising department.   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun denied five days ago that anyrepresentative of Pickens had approached the paper to publish thead.   Pickens has said he tried to place the ads in an effort tomotivate the Japanese public to complain about how the big businesscartels force higher prices on consumers.   The ad requests that Japanese consumers with any information on``unfair practices'' among carmakers to send it to Pickens inDallas, Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
