The growth of superconducting UBe{sub13} films was easier than that of UPt{sub 3} films because of much lowerpreparation temperature. Superconducting properties of UBe{sub 13} filmswere very similar to those of UBe{sub 13} bulk material. Even thoughx-ray-diffraction analysis showed that well-ordered UPt{sub 3} filmshad been prepared, the superconducting properties of the UPt{sub 3} filmswere poor because of the presence of small concentrations of impurityphases. Impurity-phase formation was difficult to deal with because temperaturesas high as 1200{sup 0}C were required in the processing and because ofthe great sensitivity of UPt{sub 3} to impurities. A difference betweenUBe{sub 13} films and bulk materials is the absence of the resistancepeak at 2.4 K observed in bulk material in the films, a result that suggeststhat the resistance peak is unrelated to superconductivity. This is incontrast with a common view that it is. However, the broad maximum inthe normal-state resistance found near 20 K was observed. The temperaturedependence of the parallel and perpendicular critical magnetic fieldsof UBe{sub 13} films were measured.</TEXT></DOC>
