(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who sued his ex-girlfriend to preventher from having an abortion dropped his lawsuit Wednesday, saying hebelieved she wasn't pregnant.   Elton K. Johnson dropped his lawsuit after learning through avariety of sources, though not from a medical examination, that the23-year-old woman known as ``Jane Doe'' was not pregnant, said hisattorney, Richard G. Whiting.   However, the woman's attorney said Johnson knew no more about herclient's condition Wednesday than when he began his court fight lastweek.   ``They've dropped the case. ... We take the position that that isa victory,'' said attorney Victoria Eslinger.   The withdrawal nullified a court order barring the woman fromseeking an abortion, canceled a Lexington Family Court hearing onthe lawsuit scheduled for Thursday and left Ms. Eslinger's clientfree to do what she wished.   Ms. Eslinger said the woman ``was extremely relieved'' byJohnson's decision. The woman still refuses to say whether she ispregnant or not, her attorney said.   Whiting asked the woman to take a pregnancy test, but she refused.   Johnson and the woman had a three-month relationship that ended amonth ago, but Johnson had wanted her to carry the fetus to term ifshe was pregnant, Ms. Eslinger said.   On Aug. 23, Johnson won the temporary restraining order, whichhad been set to expire next Monday.   Ms. Eslinger said the withdrawal of the lawsuit vindicated herbelief that the Family Court did not have jurisdiction in the caseand affirmed what she said was a woman's right to terminate apregnancy in the first three months.   Whiting countered that the case did not need to proceed onceJohnson became convinced the woman was not pregnant. ``I don't thinkthis particular case ended up being a test on any issue because itwas stopped,'' he said.   Steven Bates, executive director of the South Carolina chapter ofthe American Civil Liberties Union, said the lawsuit appeared to bepart of a concerted effort by anti-abortion activists to alter thelaw.   ``This is guerilla warfare by the right-to-lifers,'' Bates said.``There is no legal basis for bringing these actions.''   Whiting said Johnson's motives were sincere. ``This case was notbrought for publicity reasons,'' he said, predicting the U.S.Supreme Court's July decision expanding the states' right to limitabortion could spark similar cases.</TEXT></DOC>
