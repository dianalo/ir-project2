No less an expert than John Walsh, director of marketplanning at Rohr Industries, believes that the Big Threemanufacturers aren't going to be delivering nearly as manyairliners as they insist they are -- not in the near term,and not over the long haul, either.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;When we look at the fundamentals, we see a lot ofpotential for postponing things,&quot; says Mr. Walsh, whose ChulaVista, Calif., company supplies Boeing, McDonnell Douglas andAirbus Industrie of Europe with engine housings,thrust-reversers and other parts.   For investors, &quot;What's open to question is how much of aslip there will be in deliveries, and how much of that isalready reflected in the shares&quot; of the airplane suppliers,says William Deatherage of Dean Witter Reynolds. He and otherWall Street analysts recently downgraded Boeing to a &quot;hold&quot;from a &quot;buy,&quot; partly because of acceleratedresearch-and-development expenses the company will incur onits new 777 airliner.   Already, industry deliveries are slipping. Since March1990, Mr. Walsh says, 150 aircraft that were supposed to besent to the airlines through 1992 have been delayed, or insome cases, canceled outright.   S.G. Warburg Securities of London envisions industrydeliveries tumbling to 397 aircraft in 1993 from 779 thisyear. &quot;The impact on those who have geared up their overheadand financial exposure in the belief that a golden era forcivil aviation has dawned will be devastating,&quot; the firmwarns in a recent report. Warburg believes Boeing could lose350 of the 1,800 or so orders on its books; it citesprecedents such as the 1968-1972 slump when Boeing's aircraftdeliveries plunged almost 75%.   The outlook is important for investors to consider becauseever more of this decade's deliveries will be wide-bodyairliners selling for $100 million or more. With more than60% of an aircraft's purchase price routinely handed fromairline to builder at the time the plane is received, delaysand cancellations can cut straight to the bottom line.   Steve Lewins, of Chancellor Capital Management, doubtsBoeing's earnings will take a hit because, given its $100billion-plus business backlog, other airlines are likely tostep up and take the planes that weaker carriers pass over.He still expects profit of $4.85 a share this year.Nonetheless, he recently downgraded Boeing from a top rankingto a neutral because, he says, &quot;all the good news is out&quot;about the stock; &quot;These stretch-outs are going to be anegative.&quot;   Boeing has lagged behind the market of late, subsidingfrom more than 52 in February to Friday's 49 1/2 but stillabove the year-end 45 3/8. McDonnell Douglas, whose stockprice of 40 1/2 largely reflects its role as the nation's No.1 defense contractor, this year has traded as low as 26 1/2and as high as 51 1/2. Rohr ended at 17 7/8 Friday, up from ayear-end close of 16 3/8.   Mr. Walsh's sobering view of the aircraft market-presentedat a recent industry conference sponsored by SpeedNews, anaviation newsletter -- stands in sharp contrast to theanalyses issued by airframe manufacturers themselves. Boeingjust published its annual long-term outlook, which forecasts8,848 jetliner deliveries for the industry through 2005. JohnHayhurst, vice president of marketing at the Seattle company,calls the airlines' current travails &quot;a hiccup.&quot;   Airbus presented to the conference an even rosierforecast, which anticipates 9,200 new planes being absorbedby carriers during the period. With a world-wide backlog of3,700 jetliners, &quot;you can have, say, 10% of it slip withoutaffecting the solidity of the system,&quot; says David Jennings,Airbus's vice president of marketing. McDonnell Douglas'schief economist, Adam Pilarski, expects a total of 8,730deliveries industrywide during the next 15 years. &quot;We reallylooked for evidence of market maturation, and we couldn'tfind it,&quot; he says.   But Mr. Walsh envisions a strikingly slower pace: 7,555planes entering service over the next 15 years. With the Gulfwar over, &quot;we've already assumed that oil will be at or below$20 a barrel by June 1991,&quot; he explains. &quot;But we seedepressed housing, auto and banking sectors, a large warbill, rapidly eroding Eastern European economies . . . and anawesome U.S. budget deficit.&quot;   Many analysts remain confident that when the airlineindustry emerges from its nadir, cash-rich Boeing is in greatshape to capitalize on its No. 1 market share. McDonnellDouglas, despite incessantly sour earnings, could also bepoised for a turnabout with the launch of its MD-11 jumbojet.   Even Dr. Gloom is quick to say that 7,555 is a lot ofairplanes. And, he adds, there could be a &quot;substantialpost-1995 stimulus to the travel markets and aircraft sales&quot;as a result of demand from Eastern Europe, the Soviet Unionand possibly China.   But for companies judged on their quarter-to-quarterearnings performance -- and for the investors who seekconsistency in those numbers -- 1995 is a long way away.Concedes McDonnell Douglas's Mr. Pilarski: &quot;You can drown inthe short term.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
