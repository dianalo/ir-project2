On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate _ the benchmark grade of U.S. crude _ plunged 40cents Thursday to settle at $17.72 a barrel, the lowest level of thesession. The contract had jumped 58 cents on Wednesday and hit ahigh of $18.48 at one point Thursday.   Among refined petroleum contracts traded on the exchangeThursday, February home heating oil closed down 1.26 cents at 50.87cents a gallon, after rising 1.43 cents on Wednesday.   The February contract for unleaded gasoline, which rose 1.30cents on Wednesday, settled off 1.65 cents at 49.87 cents a gallon.   The seven non-OPEC countries, including Mexico and Egypt, saidafter the daylong meeting in London Thursday that they'd supportOPEC's target price of $18 a barrel. But they didn't specify in ajoint statement with OPEC whether they would cut their oilproduction to do so, and analysts said that troubled many traders.   ``They didn't recommend any specific action,'' said NaumanBarakat, vice president of energy investments at Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. ``Their statement was so vague that it didn't reallymean anything.''   Speculation that independent producers might offer to cut theircollective oil production by at least 5 percent had sent oil pricessharply higher on Wednesday and early Thursday, following a selloffon Tuesday.   OPEC General Secretary Subroto said that the 5 percent cut ``isan option.''   Oil prices have risen sharply since early October, a month beforethe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to limitits production to 18.5 million barrels a day. The agreement waseffective Jan. 1.   OPEC members are now producing an estimated 19.5 million barrelsa day, down as much as 3.5 million barrels a day from the fourthquarter.</TEXT></DOC>
