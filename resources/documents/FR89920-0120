Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from August 25, 1989 through September 8, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on September 6, 1989 (54 FR 37040). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) Involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,and should cite the publication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By October 20, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filedby the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety andLicensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and theSecretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issuea notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Carolina Power andamp; Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County,North Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>October 26, 1988, as supplementedMarch 30, 1989, June 13, 1989, and August 4, 1989. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendments reviseTechnical Specifications (TS) Section 3/4 4.6, ``Pressure/Temperature Limits'',to modify the current TS wording, the Limiting Conditions for Operation,and Pressure/Temperature Limit Curves to make them consistent with theguidance contained in Generic Letter 88-11, ``NRC Position on RadiationEmbrittlement Of Reactor Vessel Materials And Its Impact On Plant Operations,''dated July 12, 1988. Repagination of TS Sections 3/4.4.6, 3/4.4.7, and3/4.4.8, is included to accommodate the three additional pages resultingfrom this proposed amendment. Bases pages will also be changed accordingly.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazard consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazard consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Aproposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.Currently TS Section 3.4.6.1 specifies reactor vessel shell temperatureand reactor vessel pressure. The proposed change revises this wording tospecify reactor coolant system temperature and pressure. The licensee provideda no significant hazards consideration analysis to support a no significanthazards consideration for this change as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The change does not involve a significant hazards considerations forthe following reasons: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Reactor coolant system temperature and pressure are currently utilizedto comply with the requirements of TS Section 3/4.4.6 and have been evaluatedto confirm that they are representative of the vessel shell temperatureand vessel pressure. The proposed change is being requested to clarifythe specification to preclude potential confusion. The reactor coolantsystem temperature, measured at the recirculation pump suction, is actuallylower than that of the vessel shell during various phases of operation(i.e., reactor startup, operation, and immediately following reactor shutdown)because of the effects of gamma heating of the reactor vessel. Therefore,use of recirculation pump suction temperature is more conservative duringthese operational phases. Since the coolant system data is representativeof the vessel shell temperature, the probability of a pressure boundaryfailure will remain the same and will provide the same limitations on theconsequences of a pressure boundary failure. Based on this reasoning, CPandamp;Lhas determined that the proposed amendment does not involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated becausethe postulated accident scenario and accident initiators remain the same.Moreover, the source of the data used to satisfy the requirements of TSSection 3/4.4.6 is representative of the reactor vessel shell temperature.The change in wording will have no impact on reactor coolant system operationand will not create the possibility of any new accident mode. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Revision of the wording to reflect the actual data source willclarify the specification. Since the reactor coolant system temperature(taken at the reactor recirculation pump suction) is representative of,and at times slightly more conservative than the reactor vessel shell temperature,the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety. </ITAG>The proposed change replaces the present temperature/pressure limit curvescontained in Figures 3.4.6.1-1 through 3.4.6.1-3 with five new curves.The new curves cover the same operational conditions as the previous curves(i.e., non-nuclear heatup, low power physics tests, cooldown followinga shutdown, criticality and inservice hydrostatic tests) along with twoadditional curves for hydrostatic and leak tests. This results in threehydrostatic and leak test curves which cover testing operations at lessthan or equal to 8, 10, and 12 effective full power years (EFPY). The licensee'sanalyses of no significant hazards follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The change does not involve a significant hazards consideration forthe following reasons: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The revised temperature/pressure limit curves are based on themost current regulatory requirements along with actual neutron flux/fluencedata. These curves provide the necessary safety margin to assure structuralintegrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary. This safety marginis designed to preclude the probability of a pressure boundary failure.The consequences of a pressure boundary failure are not impacted by theproposed change. Since these curves are based on the most current regulatoryguidance and fluence data, CPandamp;L has determined that the proposed amendmentdoes not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The accidents analyzed in Chapter 15 of the Updated FSAR are notaffected by the revised temperature/pressure limit curves. These curvesare designed to provide fracture protection for the reactor coolant pressureboundary and do not create any new accident modes. Accident modes for thereactor coolant pressure boundary, due to nonductile failure, are wellunderstood within the industry. The temperature/pressure limit curves merelyprovide the protection mechanisms to preclude such a failure. Therefore,the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Temperature/pressure limit curves are designed to provide a specificmargin of safety. This margin is required to be at least as great as thatspecified in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, AppendixG, and Appendix G to 10CFR50. The revised curves are based on the latestNRC guidelines (Regulatory Guide 1.99, Rev. 2), along with the actual neutronflux/fluence data for the Brunswick Units. Thus, the revised curves providea greater confidence level than the present curves. Based on this reasoningCPandamp;L has determined that the proposed amendment does not involve asignificant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The proposed change adds additional limiting conditions for operation toTS Section 3.4.6.1 for hydrostatic or leak testing and for the reactorvessel flange and head flange temperatures with the reactor vessel headbolting studs under tension. The licensee provided the following no significanthazards analysis. <ITAG tagnum="21">The change does not involve a significant hazards consideration forthe following reasons: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed limiting conditions for operation provide added protectionagainst the probability of a reactor coolant pressure boundary failureduring hydrostatic and leak testing and during conditions when the vesselhead bolting studs are under tension. The consequences of a reactor coolantpressure boundary failure are not affected by the additional operationalconstraints. Based on this reasoning, CPandamp;L has determined that theproposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The accidents analyzed in Chapter 15 of the Updated FSAR are notaffected by the additional limiting conditions for operation. The additionaloperational constraints have been added to comply with the current regulationand provide added reactor coolant pressure boundary protection. As statedpreviously, accident modes for reactor coolant pressure boundary due tononductile failure are well understood within the industry. The revisedlimiting conditions for operation merely provide an additional protectionmechanism without creating any new accident modes. Therefore, the proposedamendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The additional limiting conditions for operation were added toassure adequate safety margins during hydrostatic and leak testing, andto place limits on the reactor vessel flange and head flange temperatureswhen the head bolting studs are under tension. These additional operationalconstraints provide added safety margin relative to the requirements of10CFR50, Appendix G. Based on this reasoning, CPandamp;L has determined thatthe proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety. </ITAG>The proposed change repaginates TS Section 3/4.4.6, Section 3/4.4.7, andSection 3/4.4.8 to accommodate three additional pages. The licensee providedthe following no significant hazards analysis. <ITAG tagnum="21">The change does not involve a significant hazards consideration forthe following reasons: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed change is an administrative change to the TechnicalSpecifications to prevent the need for adding subpages. Repagination isnecessary to accommodate additional text and figures, and has no impacton the specification. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involvea significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed change is purely administrative. It will provide numericalconsistency of the pages within the specified TS Sections without creatingany change to the technical content of the specifications. Therefore, theproposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed change is to an administrative change. There willbe no impact on the specification as a result of this change. The changewill merely provide numerical consistency of the pages in the specifiedsections, and will eliminate the need for using subpages. Therefore, theproposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety. </ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendmentdoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S.

Adensam <ITAG tagnum="84">Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, Docket No. 50-213, HaddamNeck Plant, Middlesex County, Connecticut </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 28, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment willremove cycle specific parameters from the Technical Specifications (TS)as recommended in Generic Letter 88-16, ``Removal of Cycle-Specific ParameterLimits from Technical Specifications.'' In addition, in TS Section 3.1.3.5,fully withdrawn position has been redefined as 317 steps; in TS Section3.4.1.4.1 some flexibility regarding RHR operation during heatup has beenadded because of problems during the last outage; and TS Section 3.4.9.1has been clarified to allow the low temperature overpressure protectionsystem to be isolated during performance of RCS hydrostatic and leak testing.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. In accordance with10 CFR 50.92 Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company has reviewed the proposedTechnical Specification and concluded that they do not involve a significanthazards consideration because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. I. Generic Letter 88-16 Related Changes There are no design basis accidents impacted by the format change to relocatethe cycle-specific parameter limits from the technical specifications tothe Technical Report Supporting Cycle Operation (TRSCO). The Cycle 16 parameterlimits are provided in the Core Operating Limits Section of the TRSCO.The Cycle 16 reload has affected some of the core physics parameters. Theseparameters were input to the design basis accident and transient analysis.The design basis LOCA and non-LOCA transients were evaluated to determinewhat impact resulted from the Cycle 16 reload core. As discussed in theTRSCO, there is little if any impact on the consequences of any designbasis transients. In addition, neither the proposed technical specificationchanges nor the Cycle 16 reload affect the probability of occurrence ofany design basis accidents. Therefore, these proposed changes are concludedto not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof any accidents previously analyzed. II. Axial Offset/LHGR/DNB Parameters These proposed changes are clarifications of existing surveillance requirements.These changes have no impact on the operation of the Haddam Neck Plant.The axial offset surveillance cannot be accurately performed until a minimumof three days operation at 80% and the RCS flow rate surveillance cannotbe accurately performed until achieving 100% power. Therefore, the proposedchanges ensure that proper and accurate surveillance tests are performed.The linear heat generation rate (LHGR) surveillance as proposed ensuresthat the LHGR will not exceed the initial conditions assumed for the LOCAanalyses prior to performing the axial offset surveillance. As such, thereis no impact on the probability or consequences of any accident previouslyevaluated. III. Control Rod Insertion Limits Changing the ``all rods out'' position from 320 steps to 317 steps doesnot impact the probability or consequences of any design basis accidents.The 317 step position is based on the interface between the fuel assembliesand the control rods. All the physical models used in the cycle designand determination of safety analysis input parameters assume that the ``allrods out'' position is 317 steps. No safety systems are affected by thischange nor are any design basis events affected. This proposed change moreprecisely reflects the physical configuration in the core. IV. RCS Heatup/RCS Hydrostatic and Leak Testing The proposed changes allow the operating RHR pump to be deenergized duringRCS heatup and allows the LTOPS to be isolated during the performance ofRCS hydrostatic or leak testing. Clarifications to the testing, heatup,and cooldown curves are also included. The proposed technical specification changes do not affect the probabilityof failure of the RHR or LTOP systems. The LTOPS is not required duringthe performance of a hydrostatic and/or leak test provided they are performedabove 245anddegrees; F and 235anddegrees; F respectively, and a heatup rateless than/or equal to 10 F/hour is maintained for one hour prior to andduring the test. The RHR system would purposely be taken out of service during an RCS heatupin MODE 5 with low decay heat by deenergizing the operating RHR pump. Shuttingoff the pump does not affect the probability of failure of that pump, nordoes it affect the probability of failure of the remaining operable pump.Overall, these proposed changes do not affect the probability or consequencesof any design basis accidents nor do the changes increase the probabilityof a failure of a safety system or degrade the performance of a safetysystem below that assumed in the design basis analysis. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously evaluated I. Generic Letter 88-16 Related Changes There are no failure modes associated with the proposed technical specificationschanges on the Cycle 16 reload. A review of the affected on-LOCA and LOCAtransients has demonstrated that the plant response has not been modifiedto the point where a new accident has been identified. Accordingly, thesechanges are concluded to not present the possibility for a new unanalyzedaccident. II. Axial Offset/LGHR/DNB Parameters These changes provide clarifications and a correction of existing technicalspecifications to ensure that the surveillance requirements are effectiveand perform their intended function. There is no impact on plant operationor response. Therefore, it is concluded that these proposed changes donot present the possibility for a new unanalyzed accident. III. Control Rod Insertion Limits The proposed change redefines the ``all rods out'' position to more preciselyreflect the physical relationship between the fuel and control rods. Theplant response is not modified by this proposed change nor are there anynew failure modes presented. The proposed change does not impact the probabilityof an accident to the point where it should be considered within the designbasis. IV. RCS Heatup/RCS Hydrostatic and Leak Testing The plant response due to the proposed changes has not been modified tothe point where it can be considered that a new accident has been defined.The hydrostatic and leak tests will continue to be performed above 245anddegrees;F and 235anddegrees; F respectively. Taking the RHR pump out of service inMODE 5 with low decay heat will allow a normal RCS heatup. The failure mode of a low temperature, overpressurization event occurringbelow 315anddegrees; F while the LTOPS is isolated, has already been analyzed.Limiting the heatup rate to less than or equal to 10 degrees F while theLTOPS is out of service addresses this potential. Therefore, these proposedchanges do not create the potential for a new unanalyzed accident. Thereare no failure modes associated with taking the operating RHR pump outof service during an RCS heatup since the performance of the RHR systemis not affected. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety I. Generic Letter 88-16 Related Changes The proposed changes to the technical specifications and the Cycle 16 reloadhave been evaluated for their impact on non-LOCA and LOCA design basisevents. Since as previously stated there is no impact on the consequencesof the design basis events, therefore, it follows that there is no impacton the protective boundaries. There are no failure modes associated withthe proposed changes or the Cycle 16 reload. Therefore, there is no impacton the margin of safety. II. Axial Offset/LGHR/DNB Parameters These proposed changes do not involve any failure modes or changes in plantoperation or transient response. These changes are proposed to better ensurethat operating limits are maintained. Therefore, there is no impact onthe margin of safety. III. Control Rod Insertion Limits This proposed change has no impact on the protective boundaries of theplant. There are no failure modes associated with this change and thereis no affect on the safety limits. This proposed change simply reflectsthe physical configuration in the core more precisely. IV. RCS Heatup/RCS Hydrostatic and Leak Testing The proposed changes do not impact the protective boundaries. Performanceof a hydrostatic and/or leak test above 245anddegrees; F or 235anddegrees;F respectively while maintaining a heatup rate less than 10anddegrees; F/hourone hour prior to and during the test assures that the margin of safetyrequired by 10 CFR 50 Appendix G is maintained. Deenergizing the operatingRHR pump in MODE 5 with low decay heat will result in a controlled RCSheatup without affecting the protective boundaries. The NRC staff has reviewed this analysis and based on this review, it appearsthat the three standards are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposesto determine that the application for amendment involves no significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Russell Library, 123 BroadStreet, Middletown, Connecticut 06457. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499.<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

In accordance with10 CFR 50.92 Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company has reviewed the proposedTechnical Specifications and concluded that they do not involve a significanthazards consideration because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. The modifications to the ECCS will provide for redundant isolation of theHPSI miniflow during sump recirculation and will resolve single failureconcerns in the chemical and volume control system (CVCS), RHR, HPSI, andLPSI systems. As such, these modifications will not adversely impact theconsequences of design basis accidents because they do not change the ECCSdelivery rates. The proposed changes to the ECCS surveillance requirementswill provide added assurance that the ECCS modification will operate reliably.The physical improvements to ECCS will improve reliability and redundancyof the system, and as a result, will not adversely impact the probabilityor consequences of previously analyzed accidents. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously evaluated. The proposed changes to the technical specifications ensure that the plantresponse is within the design basis. No new failure modes are introducedby these proposed technical specification requirements. The proposed changesimprove ECCS reliability and redundancy. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety The physical changes made to the plant that are reflected in these proposedtechnical specifications provide an enhancement to the protective boundariesby increasing redundancy and reliability. The surveillance requirementsimposed by this proposed change also assure the reliability of these components.The proposed changes to the technical specifications do not impact thesafety limits for the protective boundaries. Therefore, the proposed changedoes not result in a reduction of any margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed this analysis and based on this review, it appearsthat the three standards are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposesto determine that the application for amendment involves no significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Russell Library, 123 BroadStreet, Middletown, Connecticut 06457. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499.<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.<T3>Containment Spray Valves </T3> The proposed change to TS 3.3.B.2.c would change the containment spraysystem valves' allowable out-of-service time from 24 hours to 72 hours.License Amendment No. 132 (issued June 29, 1988) changed the allowableout-of-service time for the containment spray pumps from 24 hours to 72hours. Due to an administrative error during the preparation of LicenseAmendment No. 132, the allowable out-of-service time from these valveswas not changed at that time. Therefore, the proposed change would makethe allowable out-of-service time for these valves consistent with theallowable out-of-service time for the containment spray valves. Since theproposed change is an administrative change to the technical specificationsto achieve consistency throughout the technical specifications (72 hourallowable out-of-service time for all equipment in the containment spraysystem), the proposed change meets Example (1) of the Commission's Examplesof Amendments That Are Considered Not Likely To Involve Significant HazardsConsiderations (51 FR 7751, dated March 6, 1986) and therefore the staffproposes that this proposed change will not involve a Significant HazardsConsideration. <T3>Spray Additive Tank </T3> The proposed addition of TS 3.3.B.2.d would permit reactor operation tocontinue for up to 72 hours with the spray additive tank and its associatedpiping, valves and eductors inoperable provided both containment spraypumps and the five fan cooler units are operable. In the absence of thisproposed addition, TS 3.0.1 would be applied. TS 3.0.1 would require theunit to be in hot shutdown within 7 hours and in cold shutdown within thefollowing 30 hours if the spray additive tank or its associated equipmentare inoperable. The licensee provided the following analysis of this proposed change anddetermined that this proposed change would not involve a Significant HazardsConsideration because operation of Indian Point Unit No 2 in accordancewith this proposed change would not: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since the Spray Additive Tank and its associated piping, valves andeductors are a passive system with the exception of its two isolation valveswhich are air operated, fail open, and installed in parallel; since thesecomponents deal only with accident mitigation; and since these componentsdo not provide any sort of automatic initiation; there are no credibleequipment failures that would initiate an accident. In addition, sincethe entire assembly is located outside containment, there are no crediblefailures attributable to this equipment that could directly affect theReactor Coolant System. Thus, unavailability of the Spray Additive Tankwould not significantly increase the probability of an accident previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to a significant increase in the consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated, it is important to note that the accident mitigationcapabilities of the Spray Additive Tank are the removal of iodine fromthe containment atmosphere and the pH balancing of the recirculated waterto prevent corrosion in a post-LOCA condition. In addressing the iodineremoval capability of the Spray Additive Tank, a plant-specific PRA evaluationwas conducted to determine the effects of a 72 hour LCO. The results ofthis evaluation determined that a 72 hour LCO showed an inconsequentialincrease in the public health risk. In addition, Section 1.1 of WCAP-11611(``Methodology for Elimination of the Containment Spray Additive'', March1988) states: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Analyses performed by Westinghouse, utilizing current NRC methodology(SRP 6.5.2, Revision 1) and combined with knowledge gained from many studieson the behavior of iodine in the post-LOCA environment, have demonstratedthe relatively minor role of the spray additive in meeting the dose guidelinesof 10 CFR 100. The proposed Revision 2 to SRP 6.5.2 goes even further indemonstrating this relatively minor role of the spray additive by eliminatingits consideration.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As for pH balancing, it is also possible to add NaOH to the BoricAcid Batching Tank and then inject the solution via the normal Chemicaland Volume Control System charging paths into the Reactor Coolant System.The solution would flow out the break that caused the LOCA, mix with waterin the bottom of the containment and provide the necessary pH balance.This additional injection pathway methodology is already contained in ourEmergency Operating Procedures (ES-1.3, ``Transfer to Cold Leg Recirculation'')as the alternate method for assuring long term pH control. Finally, theproposed LCO has the same time limit as the Standard Technical Specifications'LCO. Thus, it is concluded that there is no significant increase in theconsequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, this proposed change to Technical Specification 3.3.B.2does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change provides an LCO for the Spray Additive Tank thathas the same time limit as the Standard Technical Specification' LCO. Nophysical changes to the Spray Additive Tank or its associated componentsare required with respect to this proposed LCO. Therefore, the proposedchange to Technical Specification 3.3.B.2 does not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The accident mitigation capabilities of the Spray Additive Tank arethe removal of iodine from the containment atmosphere and the pH balancingof the recirculated water to prevent corrosion in a post-LOCA condition.As discussed above, a plant-specific PRA evaluation determined that a 72hour LCO showed an inconsequential increase in the public health risk.Additionally, Section 1.1 of WCAP-11611 (``Methodology for Eliminationof the Containment Spray Additive'', March 1988) concluded that the roleof the spray additive in meeting the dose guidelines of 10CFR100 is relativelyminor and that the proposed Revision 2 to SRP 6.5.2 goes even further indemonstrating this relatively minor role of the spray additive by eliminatingits consideration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As for pH balancing, alternative proceduralized paths exist to addNaOH to the Boric Acid Batching Tank and then inject the solution via thenormal Chemical and Volume Control System charging paths into the ReactorCoolant System. The solution would flow out the break that caused the LOCA,mix with water in the bottom of the containment and provide the necessarypH balance. This injection path is not affected by the proposed change.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed change to Technical Specification 3.3.B.2does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>Based on the above discussion, the licensee determined that the proposedchange to TS 3.3.B.2.d does not involve a Significant Hazards Consideration.The staff agrees with the licensee's analysis and proposes that this proposedchange will not involve a Significant Hazards Consideration. <T3>Battery Chargers </T3> The proposed addition of TS 3.7.B.5 would permit reactor operation to continuefor up to 24 hours with one battery charger inoperable provided the otherthree battery chargers and their associated batteries are operable andthe affected battery is determined operable by performance of TS 4.6.C.1within 1 hour and every 8 hours thereafter. In the absence of this proposedaddition, TS 3.0.1 would be applied. TS 3.0.1 would require the unit tobe in hot shutdown within 7 hours and in cold shutdown within the following30 hours if one battery charger is inoperable. The licensee provided the following analysis of this proposed change anddetermined that this proposed change would not involve a Significant HazardsConsideration because operation of Indian Point Unit No. 2 in accordancewith this proposed change would not: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Upon loss of the Battery Charger, the associated Station Battery wouldsupply power to the affected loads. Thus, a time period exists when theBattery Charger can be out of service and there would be no effect on plantoperation nor any impact on the plant design basis because unaffected safetysystems are still operable and the Battery Charger is not necessary tomitigate design basis accidents. Upon entering the proposed LCO the operatorswould be aware what loads are carried by the affected Station Battery andthrough the use of existing procedures inappropriate operator action dueto degraded voltage on the affected bus would be precluded. Thus, unavailabilityof the Battery Charger would not significantly increase the probabilityof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to a significant increase in the consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated, the proposed LCO requires the other three StationBatteries be operable and that the surveillance under Technical Specification4.6.C.1 be implemented frequently on the affected Station Battery to assureits continued operability. By more frequent monitoring of critical batteryparameters, timely actions can be taken to assure Station Battery longevity.Under Technical Specification 3.7.B there is an existing LCO which allowsone Station Battery to be inoperable for 24 hours providing all four BatteryChargers and the other three Station Batteries are operable. Under boththe existing LCO for the Station batteries and the proposed LCO for theBattery Chargers, the single active failure of a safety-related component,coincident with a Loss-Of-Offsite-Power (LOOP) would still be the mostlimiting accident condition. It has been determined that the existing LCOon the Station Batteries bounds the proposed LCO on the Battery Chargers.Therefore, the consequences of an accident previously evaluated remainedunchanged. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, this proposed change to Technical Specification 3.7.B doesnot involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.

Under Technical Specification3.7.B there is an existing LCO which allows one Station Battery to be inoperablefor 24 hours providing all four Battery Chargers and the other three StationBatteries are operable. The existing LCO on the Station Batteries boundsthe proposed LCO on the Battery Chargers because equipment that could losepower during a Loss-Of-Offsite-Power coincident with a postulated accidentunder the existing Station Battery LCO, would retain power under the proposedBattery Charger LCO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed change to Technical Specification 3.7.B doesnot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3.

Although the Battery Chargerwill now be allowed a limited out of service time of 24 hours maximum,this condition is bounded by the already allowed LCO on the Station Batteriesbecause equipment that could lose power during a Loss-Of-Offsite-Powercoincident with a postulated accident under the existing Station BatteryLCO, would retain power under the proposed Battery Charger LCO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed change to Technical Specification 3.7.B doesnot involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>Based on the above discussion, the licensee determined that the proposedaddition of TS 3.7.B.5 does not involve a Significant Hazards Consideration.The staff agrees with the licensee's analysis and proposes that this proposedchange will not involve a Significant Hazards Consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>White Plains Public Library,100 Martime Avenue, White Plains, New York, 10610. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Brent L.

(1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated becausethe organizational changes will not affect the protected safe storage modethe facility is in. Furthermore, the Technical Specification continue torequire that NASA provides whatever resources are required to maintainthe facility in a condition that poses no hazard to the general publicor to the environment.

The proposed changewould also delete the applicability of the extension provisions of Specification4.0.2 from the surveillance. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with a proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three standards in the amendment application.In regard to the three standards, the licensee provided the following analysis.The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the dieselgenerators are standby equipment which do not contribute to the occurrenceof an accident. Extension of the surveillance frequency from 18 monthsto a maximum of 30 months does not change either the diesel-generator functionor its operation. The proposal to increase monitoring of certain diesel-generatorparameters will serve to identify adverse operating trends. The abilityof the diesel-generators to respond and operate as required will not bedegraded as concurred with by the manufacturer of the diesel-generators.The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated since the diesel-generatorscannot initiate an accident and no hardware changes are being made. Onmatters related to nuclear safety, all accidents are bounded by previousanalysis and no new malfunctions are involved. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety since the assumptions in the licensee's Updated Safety AnalysisReport (USAR) remain unchanged and the diesel-generators will continueto perform their function. Past experience with this class of equipment,the demonstrated reliability of the diesel-generators at Davis-Besse, andthe increased trending of the diesel-generator operating parameters toidentify adverse operating trends will provide reasonable assurance thatthere will not be any significant degradation in diesel-generator reliability.The staff has reviewed and agrees with the licensee's no significant hazardsconsideration determination analysis.

The licensee has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with the requirementsof 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that the request does not involve asignificant hazard consideration. The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards considerationbecause the operation of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station in accordancewith these changes would: 1.

A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has provided the following analysis of no significant hazardsconsiderations using the Commission's standards. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. In the proposed change,when a radiation monitor is allowed to be taken out of service, redundantoperable radiation monitors are still in service. The monitors that remainin service provide the same signal to the same equipment and at the samesetpoint as the monitor that is removed from service. The additional allowedoutage time associated with this change is insignificant when comparedto the probability of an event which requires actuation, coincident witha failure of the remaining operable detector. The proposed change doesnot affect the ability of the monitors to perform their intended safetyfunction. Additionally, the current technical specifications allows oneof the two safety trains of either system to be out of service for 7 days.The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any previously evaluated. There are no new failuremodes or mechanisms associated with the proposed change. This change doesnot involve any modification in the operational limits or physical designof the involved systems. The change merely allows an extended time periodfor the diagnosis and repair of radiation monitoring systems, thus reducingthe excessive use of the emergency exhaust systems for the control roomand fuel building. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. This change does not affect any technical specification marginof safety. This change allows appropriate actions commensurate with thesignificance of the monitor malfunction, provided the malfunction doesnot affect the capability of the monitors to perform their safety function.Based on the previous discussions, the licensee concluded that the proposedamendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; does not create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; does not involve a reduction in the required margin of safety.The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. The staff, therefore, proposes to determine that the licensee's requestdoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Callaway County Public Library,710 Court Street, Fulton, Missouri 65251 and the John M.

An evaluation performed by Westinghouse ElectricCorporation for the Westinghouse Owners Group Turbine Valve Test Frequency(TVTF) evaluation subgroup (WCAP-11525) provides justification for theproposed change. The specific TS change proposed would include the following: (1) a replacementof the monthly surveillance requirement for turbine governor and stop valveswith the variable surveillance frequency requirement consistent with WCAP-11525,not to exceed one year; (2) removal of the operational limitation waiverfor the monthly surveillance on Table TS 4.1-3. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards (10 CFR 50.92(c)) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.In regard to the proposed amendment, the licensee has determined the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The referenced analysis as reported in WCAP-11525 provides an evaluationof the probability of turbine missile ejection for the purpose of justifyinga reduction in the frequency of turbine valve testing. In a letter to WestinghouseElectric Corporation dated February 2, 1987 (C E Rossi, USNRC to J A Martin,Westinghouse), the commission established acceptable criteria for the probabilityof generating a turbine missile from an unfavorably oriented turbine (acceptableprobability of missile generation [less than] 1.0 x 10-5). The evaluationin WCAP-11525 shows that the probability of a missile ejection incidentfor turbine valve test intervals of up to one year is significantly lessthan the established acceptance criteria. The small change in the probabilityof generating a turbine missile with longer turbine valve testing intervalsdoes not represent a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment decreases the frequency at which turbine valvesare tested. The proposed amendment does not change the kind, number, ortype of overspeed protection components available. Changing the frequencyof turbine valve testing does not result in a significant change in thefailure rate or change failure modes for the turbine valves. Therefore,the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As noted above and as shown in WCAP-11525, this change to the KewauneeTechnical Specifications will not result in a significant reduction inthe margin of safety for missile ejection. The probability of missile ejectionremains acceptably small and within guidelines established by the NRC Staff.</ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's determination related to no significanthazards consideration and concurs with its finding. On this basis, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of Wisconsin LibraryLearning Center, 2420 Nicolet Drive, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>David Baker, Esq., Foley and Lardner, P.O.Box 2193 Orlando, Florida 31082. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John N.

The proposed change would acceleratethe removal of the ``S'' capsule to the fall of 1990 and delay the removalof the ``P'' capsule until the fall of 1996. In addition, the bases sectionwould be changed to reflect Point Beach's participation in the Babcockand Wilcox Master Integrated Reactor Vessel Surveillance Program. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92 for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequenceof an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed revisions to the surveillance capsule removal schedule arerequired to reflect flux reductions underway and Point Beach's participationin the BWOG's Master Integrated Reactor Vessel Surveillance Program. Therevised surveillance capsule withdrawal schedule will provide reactor vesselmaterials data more representative of that predicted at End of Life (EOL)and 150% EOL. These changes also are required to satisfy the requirementsof 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix H, and ASTM E185-82. The proposed changes tothe surveillance capsule withdrawal schedule would have no bearing on theprobability or consequences of an accident previously identified sinceit involves only a schedular change necessary to keep Point Beach in compliancewith the regulations and does not involve any physical change or modificationto the plant or associated facilities. For the same reason, the proposedchanges cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentthan any accident previously identified.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By October 20, 1989, the licensee mayfile a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendmentto the subject facility operating license and any person whose interestmay be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a partyin the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene.Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filedin accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic LicensingProceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petitionfor leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or anAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by theChairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on therequest and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
