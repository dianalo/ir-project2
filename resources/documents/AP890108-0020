For some, it will be a Chinese puzzle that nonetheless will haveto be solved _ there just isn't enough money coming in to coverrequired outlays. Most states will be able to make it by sticking tofairly tight budgets. A lucky few will be able to salt money away orgive breaks to taxpayers.   Bound up in the legislative purse strings are calls to improveeducation, including raises for teachers; relieve prisonovercrowding; repair highways; lower property taxes, and spend moreon human services ranging from fighting drug abuse to cleaning upthe environment.   There are also non-money items: AIDS legislation in Virginia,Utah, Illinois; the death penalty in Rhode Island and Kansas;insurance reform in California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and SouthCarolina, and government restructuring in Mississippi and NorthDakota.   Finances loom foremost. The National Conference of StateLegislatures, in a survey released Friday of staff analysts in the50 legislatures, found that more than half said the main fiscalissue was obtaining enough revenue to balance state budgets. Otherfindings showed a broad concern for the soundness of state finances.   ``We are literally being tugged at from all sides, and frankly Idon't think our resources are able to be stretched much further,''said Senate President Philip Rock of Illinois, where Gov. James R.Thompson has campaigned unsuccessfully for an income tax increasethe past two years.   Lawmakers, having read voters' lips, are loath to talk about taxincreases. However, the idea is being considered in states with thebiggest money woes: West Virginia, New York, Massachusetts, Arizonaand Louisiana.   West Virginia, with a budget of only $1.46 billion, may be theworst off. It will need an additional $290 million in revenue tomeet bills in the new fiscal year, said House Finance ChairmanGeorge Farley, and that's without a newly uncovered loss ininvestments and other setbacks totaling $390 million. Farley said atax increase of $75 million to $80 million is necessary, and a salestax on food, abolished in the early 1980s, may reappear.   New York and Massachusetts saw surpluses from previous yearsquickly turn into deficits.   Massachusetts has a projected shortfall of at least $636 millionin the current $11.6 billion budget, and Gov. Michael S. Dukakisrecently proposed laying off 300 managerial employees and otherspending cuts. Many believe he will seek an increase in the gasolinetax and a cut in capital gains tax deductions.   New York is short by more than $1 billion this year, according toGov. Mario Cuomo. For the fiscal year beginning April 1, Cuomo hasestimated that even with his less-then-inflation budget he will needan additional $700 million in revenue, and he has already proposedincreasing ``sin taxes'' on cigarettes and alcohol to raise about$200 million. The third year of a three-year tax cut could bedelayed, too, although Cuomo is reluctant to do so.   The riches-to-rags example is not lost on well-off states likeHawaii, Kansas, Idaho, Utah, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon,Virginia and Wisconsin. ``It's real easy to make a tax cut rightnow, and we all look good for re-election,'' said Hawaii HouseFinance Committee Chairman Joseph Souki. ``But is that the wisestthing?''   For the majority of states, which fall somewhere in the middle,there will be hard choices. Many have balanced-budget requirementsin their constitutions.   Minnesota is in far better shape than it was two years ago, andGov. Rudy Perpich's biennial budget is expected to be $13.9 billion,a 14.5 percent spending increase that would be achieved withoutraising taxes. But even so, ``it's a very, very, very, very tightbudget,'' he said. ``I mean, tight budget. Some of the favoritesthat I've been very supportive of _ be it the arts, tourism _ it'sjust not there this time.''   Educational spending ranks high on most states' lists.``Education and economic development go together,'' said Max Coll,chairman of New Mexico's House Appropriations and Finance Committee.``Who is going to relocate or expand in a state that doesn't offer areally good education system at both the public school and highereducation levels?''   Even after budgets are settled, lawmakers won't lack items todebate. Rising auto insurance rates are expected to come underscrutiny in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Californiais awaiting the results of a court challenge to Proposition 103, acitizens' initiative passed in November that requires a 20 percentrate rollback for most kinds of insurance.   There may be an effort to repeal Illinois' year-old requirementfor premarital testing for exposure to the AIDS virus. In Utah,there are bills calling for mandatory reporting of people who testpositive for the virus, mandatory testing of inmates and astrengthening of laws to protect the privacy of AIDS patients.Virginia's General Assembly also will consider bills requiring AIDStests for sex-crime suspects and making it a felony to knowinglydonate or sell AIDS-tainted blood.</TEXT></DOC>
