Mitchell deplores the fact that &quot;the federal tax system has become less progressive, and thus less fair, since the mid-1970s.&quot; What Sen. Mitchell presents as a universal truth should be considered as a personal opinion only. Actually, there are many who believe that the fair tax system means that each pays the same proportion of his earnings in taxes. If you work harder or work with more ingenuity your income should be larger.    I am a university professor and I do not belong to the top 1% of taxpayers with average income in excess of $400,000. My earnings are far from this amount. However, I strongly believe that the tax system should be only slightly progressive. Socking the rich is a shortsighted strategy. It doesn't take long before nobody is left to be socked, and then the common folks will be even harder hit with taxes.    Besides, in a free society one should be convinced that harder work leads to a better life. Those who think otherwise should study the unenviable social situation in countries where the after-tax income is practically flat for all working people. As an emigrant from Poland I know more on this matter than can be compressed in such a short letter.    Richard B. Hetnarski   Rochester Institute of Technology   Rochester, N.Y. </TEXT></DOC>
