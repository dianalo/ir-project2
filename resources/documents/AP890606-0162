Those 18 Michigan districts started out with a population of514,560 each in 1980. As of July 1, 1986, according to the CensusBureau, the population of the 13th Congressional District inDetroit had declined to 444,600. The Fifth District, which includesGrand Rapids, had grown to 552,000.   Population isn't the only criteria. In states with a history ofracial bias, redistricting plans must be cleared by the JusticeDepartment to assure they don't discriminate against minorities.   Whatever the process, cries of ``gerrymander'' are certain to beheard across the land from politicians who didn't have the votes toget their own redistricting plan approved.   The term comes from Massachusets Gov. Elbridge Gerry, who isbetter remembered for the redistricting bill he signed in 1811 thanfor the fact that he also signed the Declaration of Independence.The redistricting bill, designed to help Democrats and weakenFederalists, created a salamander-shaped district that wasimmediately dubbed a ``gerrymander.''   But the general rule is: better to be accused of gerrymanderingthan to be gerrymandered.   Republicans cried gerrymander frequently in the early 1980s,pointing often at the most notorious recent example of the genre _the California plan attributed to the late Rep. Phil Burton. Itredrew congressional lines in a manner that Republicans claimedcost them five seats.   At the time, the governor of California was a Democrat and theparty controlled both chambers of the legislature. The Republicanswere nothing more than injured bystanders who appealedunsuccessfully to the courts for redress.   While Republicans cry foul about Democratic redistricting,Democrat Ann Lewis says the first partisan shot came from the GOP.   ``The Republicans of Indiana began the redistricting yeargloriously by using their political strength to eliminate oneDemocratic congressman and endanger others,'' said Lewis, thenpolitical director of the Democratic National Committee. ``And theRepublican Party spent the rest of the year complaining thatDemocratic majorities were trying to act in a partisan fashion.''   Republicans entered 1981 with high hopes. Reagan had just takenoffice and dreams of a historic political realignment were dancingin GOP heads. The 1980 Census had found a major shift of populationfrom traditionally Democratic industrial states to the moreconservative Sunbelt.   Banks of computers were set up at the Republican NationalCommittee as party leaders predicted technology would provide asubstantial advantage.   But in state after state, the Democratic politicians outwittedthe GOP's computers.   ``They had three computers, $4 million and a staff of 40,'' saidLewis. ``I had two typewriters, one and a half staff people and nobudget allocation at all....   ``But I had more friends than they did. I had more legislatorsthan they did and ultimately we were able to produce more votesthan they did.''   Rich Bond, a Republican consultant and former RNC politicaldirector, still gnashes his teeth when reminded of the 1981redistricting.   ``The Republican National Committee thought it had a technicaledge and talked about it a lot and it flopped,'' he said.   Redistricting can be an unsettling experience for politicianswho normally are among the nation's most secure elected officials.Most congressmen, while on the ballot every two years, have whatamount to ten-year terms. For example, 99 percent of the Housemembers who sought another term in 1988 were re-elected.   Listen to Tom Hofeller, redistricting expert for the HouseRepublican campaign committee:   ``You're not really a veteran in redistricting until you've satdown at a strategy session during the middle of the process andsaid, `We know we're safe here. They can't possibly screw us here.'And had the Mack truck come and run right over you.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 11</NOTE></DOC>
