They would score a political and psychological coupby taking some B-2 work away from Northrop Corp.   But Lockheed officials know they must avoid publiclybad-mouthing their rival and, in doing so, angering theirmain customers by criticizing the Air Force's management ofthe troubled program.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, Lockheed is embroiled in its own budget andpublic-relations tussles with the Pentagon over its F-117stealth fighter. In the afterglow of the Gulf War, Air Forceleaders tried to sell Congress on the B-2 and the importanceof stealth by capitalizing on the F-117's performance againstIraq. But with the B-2's capabilities increasingly suspect,the Air Force now is emphasizing that the F-117 also hadtechnical problems.   Secretary Donald Rice, for instance, infuriated Lockheed'sdesigners last month by publicly confirming that the earlyF-117s had serious radar-evading shortcomings and that twoprototypes crashed during flight tests. &quot;It really boils myblood to see the Air Force diminish the F-117 just to maskthe B-2's problems,&quot; a Lockheed manager says.   The Senate has further muddied the waters by approvingmore than $1 billion to buy as many as 24 more stealthfighters -- over the objections of the Pentagon, which wouldprefer more General Dynamics Corp. F-16s. Such orders wouldbe a windfall for Lockheed, but its management prefers a lowprofile until the final vote so as not to antagonize the AirForce.</TEXT></DOC>
