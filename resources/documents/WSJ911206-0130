That is now being rectified,with a (Sicilianesque) vengeance. Chiefly this is due toAurelio Zen, the Italian police inspector featured in theacclaimed suspense novels of Michael Dibdin. &quot;Vendetta&quot;(Perfect Crime, 260 pages, $18.50) is the third chroniclefeaturing Zen.   The Italy this clever but beleaguered inspector maneuversin is brimming with treachery. An officer of the Criminalpolsection of the Ministry of the Interior, Zen must be wary notonly of the expected thugs and terrorists but also ofbadgering bureaucrats, vindictive colleagues and schemingpoliticians. Expedience takes precedence over truth in thisenvironment, and framing a plausible fall guy is oftenpreferred to nailing the real villain. Those like Zen who tryto retain some degree of integrity are mocked, disbelieved orused by more cynical peers.</LP><TEXT>   In &quot;Vendetta,&quot; Inspector Zen is told to look into thekilling of a wealthy Sardinian developer who, with his wifeand guests, was shotgunned in the dining room of his heavilyprotected estate. All evidence points to the builder's sleazyassociate, but his conviction would taint an influentialgovernment figure. Zen's brief: Find a substitute culprit.   To complicate matters, the inspector is apparently beingstalked by an ex-convict with a murderous grudge. And Zen --divorced and living with his aged mother -- becomes entangledin the domestic problems of a married woman at work with whomhe is infatuated. Yet the strands of this cat's cradle areexpertly manipulated by Mr. Dibdin. &quot;Vendetta&quot; has tension,wit, a strong sense of place and a somewhat hapless hero youcan't help but root for.   Aurelio Zen works in Rome but was raised in Venice -- withits murky canals, narrow alleys and covered passageways anideal locale for a mystery. Edward Sklepowich last yearlaunched a series of Venetian mysteries featuring amateursleuth Urbino Macintyre, an expatriate American author whospecializes in biographies of such celebrated Venice-dwellersas Marcel Proust. The second in this Macintyre series,&quot;Farewell to the Flesh&quot; (Morrow, 334 pages, $19), takes placeduring the Carnevale festival, when elaborate disguisesmaximize the potential for fatal treachery.   First to fall prey to the hazards of the season is ValGibbon, an insidious British photographer whosepicture-taking may mask a less reputable form of prying. WhenGibbon is found stabbed to death, the nuns running the&quot;pensione&quot; where the Englishman lived ask Macintyre toinvestigate. Aiding the biographer's discreet inquiries ishis friend, the Contessa da Capo-Zendrini, an English-bornwoman who gives Macintyre entree into Venetian society.   &quot;Farewell's&quot; intrigue develops nicely, but the book ismost notable for its descriptions of the watery city and itseccentric residents. So beguiling are the book's wordpictures that a crucial revelation is hidden beneath ournoses in a manner worthy of &quot;The Purloined Letter.&quot;   Tokyo and London are the main locations for Emma Lathen's&quot;East Is East&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, 268 pages, $19), the 21stcase to be solved by John Putnam Thatcher, a New York bankerand amateur detective more normally found in the vicinity ofWall Street. In Japan on a routine matter, Thatcher getscaught up in the efforts of a flamboyant American businessmanto drive a wedge into the Japanese market. Official hearingsinto a proposed venture are interrupted by a murder andrumors of high-level bribery. Thatcher and crew travel backto America and then to England before getting to the bottomline. There's not much special sense of place here -- meetingrooms and hotel suites are pretty much the same, world-wide-- but the serviceable story line and some knowledgeablebusiness chat provide a few hours' pleasant diversion.   For a bit more than that, seek out the trade paperbackreissue of Richard Hugo's &quot;Death and the Good Life&quot; (ClarkCity Press, P.O. Box 1358, Livingston, Mont. 59047; 256pages, $9.95), a mystery novel first published a decade ago.Hugo, who died in 1982, was a noted poet and creative-writingteacher. His only book of fiction reflects the sensibilitiesof a man who knew how to make every word count. Al &quot;MushHeart&quot; Barnes is the hero and narrator of Hugo's quirkypolice procedural, which ranges from Plains, Mont., toOrofino, Idaho, and Portland, Ore.   &quot;Mush Heart&quot; (a nickname stemming from a reluctance tocome down hard on the lesser lawbreakers) is a veteranSeattle police detective now working as a deputy sheriff inMontana's Sanders County, where the normal placidity isbroken by a pair of brutal ax murders. His investigation ofthese killings leads Barnes to another unsolved murder from20 years ago. Four more corpses accumulate before thedetective can find the fatal links between past and present.   Hugo's plot line is filled with startling twists, and hisminor characters are real individuals. The main attraction,though, is Barnes, who once wanted to write verse and stillhas the habit of collecting imagery. &quot;Why does a Ferris wheelseem more still when it's stopped than a car does?&quot; he muses.It takes a poet to turn his own backyard into a land ofmystery.</TEXT></DOC>
