No pickup</NOTE><DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The opposition Social Democratsscored big gains in parliamentary elections Wednesday, butConservative Prime Minister Poul Schlueter said he will try to stayon by expanding his center-right minority government.   ``I will seek to build the broadest possible foundation for anon-socialist government,'' he said.   Schlueter, who has headed successive center-right coalitionssince 1982, said final results showed a continued non-socialistmajority of 91 seats in the 179-seat Folketing, or parliament.   With all ballots counted, the Social Democrats had gained 14seats for a total of 69.   Social Democratic Party leader Svend Auken demanded thatSchlueter resign, saying, ``Now is the time for a change ofgovernment and a new majority in Danish politics.''   But Schlueter said he will invite two small centrist parties,the Center Democrats and the Christian People's Party, to join hiscoalition of Conservatives, Liberals and Social Liberals, whichdropped one seat for a total of 66.   ``We must discuss the three-party coalition tomorrow (Thursday),but it's clear there is a non-socialist majority,'' he said.   If formed, it would control 89 seats in parliament - one shy ofa majority.   The Social Democrats' success was largely at the expense of theallied Socialist People's Party, which slipped from 24 to 15 seats.   It was uncertain if the Social Liberals, who dropped three oftheir 10 seats, would stay in the government.   Economy Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, the Social Liberalleader, said the party would support Schlueter's efforts to head anew government in any case.   The Center Democrats and Christian People's Party took part in around-table discussion among party leaders after returns were in,but declined to say if they would accept Schlueter's offer to joina new coalition.   Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's Liberals gained sevenseats for a total of 29, while Schlueter's Conservatives droppedfrom 35 seats to 30.   The Center Democrats held their nine seats and the ChristianPeople's Party kept its four.   Thirteen parties fielded candidates, but only the eight that satin the outgoing parliament secured the 2 percent of the vote neededto be represented.   Schlueter called the election on Nov. 22 when the SocialDemocrats blocked parliamentary passage of the government's financebill.   Voter turnout from among the 3.9 million registered voters was82.8 prcent, compared with 85.7 in the 1988 ballot. It wasDenmark's fourth parliamentary election in six years.</TEXT></DOC>
