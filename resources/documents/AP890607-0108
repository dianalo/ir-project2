The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment andhousing voted unanimously to subpoena Deborah Dean, who wasexecutive assistant to then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce in 1982-87.   The position of assistant secretary of housing turned overfrequently during the Pierce years, but Ms. Dean was there throughmost of his term, said Celia Boddington, staff member for thesubcommittee headed by Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.   The subcommittee is investigating allegations that well-connectedRepublicans were favored in a federal subsidy program for low-incomehousing construction.   James Watt, who served as interior secretary under PresidentReagan, has agreed to testify Friday about his role, after leavingoffice, as a consultant to a developer who got one of the subsidycontracts.   The developer, Judith Siegel, president of Landex Corp., hastestified that Watt helped her get a contract for a 312-unit projectin Essex, Md., under the federal government's ModerateRehabilitation Program.   The subcommittee said Watt was paid $300,000 for his services.   HUD said June 1 it was resuming subsidies, under new rules, forthe rehabilitation of privately owned housing used by low-income andmoderate-income families.   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp had suspended the program in April afterthe department's inspector general reported it had been mismanagedand riddled with favortism for former high-ranking Republicansserving as consultants to developers.   On May 25, Pierce, who headed HUD through the Reagan presidency,defended his role in the subsidy program, saying he tried to kill it.   Pierce told the subcommittee that department officials used theirdiscretion in awarding subsidies to selected developers but that wasbecause Congress in 1984 waived requirements specifying fair-shareallocation practices.</TEXT></DOC>
