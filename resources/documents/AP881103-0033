Meanwhile, Treasury Police commandos on Wednesday night stormed aprison where inmates had held three hostages for 45 hours.Authorities said three prisoners and a hostage were killed in theraid.   The guerrilla raids Wednesday followed by hours a rebel mortarattack on national guard headquarters in San Salvador that left fourdead and 37 wounded.   Rebels attacked a sugar refinery nine miles north of the capitalbefore dawn Wednesday, said the head of plant security, whoidentified himself only as Sgt. Sandoval.   ``They attacked us with mortars and rifle fire, but they didn'tdestroy the machinery. They damaged the offices, and they killedfour soldiers ... and wounded four others,'' he said.   About the same time, rebels killed two national guardsmen in a30-minute attack on a post at a nearby highway bridge, militarysources said.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said theguerrillas were mounting a coincident diplomatic effort in theregion ``to portray themselves as somehow more moderate in theirstance and more powerful than they really are.''   Redman said the attacks did not alter plans by Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz to attend a foreign ministers meeting of theOrganization of American States in San Salvador in mid-November.   Four soldiers were killed and 37 people, including sevencivilians, were wounded in the national guard attack Tuesday, thelargest rebel strike in the capital since January 1981.   The national guard is part of El Salvador's armed forces andparticipates in counterinsurgency operations.   About 65,000 people have been killed in the 9-year-old war, themajority of them civilians.   The prison assault ended a standoff that began when three inmatesjumped two guards and took their rifles at the prison inQuezaltepeque, 15 miles north of San Salvador.   The assailants, along with three other inmates, demandedpolitical asylum in Mexico in exchange for releasing the hostages, anurse and two prison guards.   Communications Minister Roberto Viera told reporters that about100 prisoners not involved in the hostage-taking had tried to fleethe prison, which was surrounded by troops.   The attempted escape provoked the six hostage-takers, who threw agrenade and began shooting at the troops and fleeing prisoners,Viera said.   ``When the rioters began firing, the special forces intervened,''Viera said.   Reporters on the scene saw the commandos blow open the doors ofprison cells and toss tear gas grenades inside to force theprisoners out.   Viera said three of the six hostage-takers and one of the guardsthey had held were killed. The nurse and the other guard were freedunharmed, while a prisoner not involved in the hostage-taking wasslightly wounded, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
