The paper discusses whathas been learned from the research at NASA on the behavior and failuremechanisms of coatings, life modeling development, crystal phases inzirconia-yttria coatings, and optimization of coatings exposed to hotsalt condensates. The need for automation and quality control duringboth research and production is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
