 It'sdesigned to work with Microsoft C 6.0 and 5.1 in large model only.andM;The translator comes in a fairly spartan package.andP;  The software fits on one1.44MB or two 1.2MB diskettes.andP;  The documentation comes in a one-inch binderthat includes a 27-page installation and user guide and a copy of the ATandamp;T2.1 Release Product Reference ManualandM;Installation is a six-step process.andP;  Although the process involves moremanual steps than any other C++, it's thorough and not difficult.andM;The translator comes in real and protected-mode, extended-memory versions.andO;The manual warns that incompatible terminate-and-stay-resident programs maycause the protected-mode version to fail.andP;  I verified this feature on my veryfirst test; the translator terminated with an internal error,  free storeexhausted.&quot; the problem went away when I unloaded ced, the residentcommand-line editor.andM;The system provides only two support tools: a compiler driver and a namedemangler.andP;  The driver conveniently accepts any combination of source files,object files, and libraries and builds an executable.andP;  It can also justpreprocess, preprocess and run cfront, or compile to an object file.andP;  Thedriver can pass options through to the C compiler.andP;  Unfortunately, it thinksc files are C++ source; it won't let you mix C and C++ files on the commandline.andP;  The library includes both iostream.h and stream.h for compatibilitywith v.1.x programs.andP;  The library classes do not have any documentation.andM;I was excited at the prospect of testing a cfront 2.1 system but wasdisappointed at how often it terminated abnormally.andP;  It turned in the poorestscores on the basic C++ features tests and compiled very few of the medium tolarge programs I tried to use.andP;  Nevertheless, it did have its shiningmoments; it turned in the best score on the negative compiler breaker tests.andO;I'd like to take another look at this product when it's a little more stable.andO;Until then, I can't recommend it.andM;NOT QUITE THERE YETandM;Since C++ grew up in the UNIX environment, we would expect the language to bevery strong under UNIX.andP;  To test the strength of the language, we requestedUNIX C++ products from almost a dozen vendors.andP;  The response was less thanoverwhelming.andP;  After considerable pressure, we finally acquired products toevaluate from Comeau Computing, Intek, Oregon Software, and the Santa CruzOperation.andM;Testing was done by a team of three on Acer 25MHZ 80386-based systemsequipped with 4MB RAM, 300MB hard disks, and VGA monitors.andP;  Tests were doneunder SCO UNIX, SCO XENIX, and Interactive 386/ix.andM;Comeau Computing's C++ is the only full version of C++ 2.1 available, otherthan ATandamp;T's.andP;  It's a complete implementation of C++ 2.1, as defined by theATandamp;T cfront program.andM;Comeau Computing C++ is available for several small-machine UNIXimplementations.andP;  It runs on all 386 and 486 UNIX and XENIX-based machines,the ATandamp;T UNIX PC and 3B2, and a number of other platforms.andP;  A lifetime freetechnical-support policy accompanies the product.andP;  The support staff deservesspecial commendation for handling all questions politely.andP;  Comeau alsoanswers questions through BIX, CompuServe, and uunet.andP;  UNIX versions ofComeau C++ offer a 30-day, money-back guarantee.andM;Comeau C++, a translating compiler, performs a full syntax and semantic checkof C++ programs, then generates C code for use with a C compiler.andP;  It doesn'tgenerate binary files itself The C++ compiler calls and executes the native Ccompiler.andM;The command como invokes the Comeau compiler and creates an intermediate Cfile after the syntax, semantic, and type checks.andP;  The native C compiler isthen invoked transparently as a second-pass object generator.andP;  Since a syntaxcheck has already been performed, the C compiler's checks can be disabled.andM;A number of command flags allow control of the compiler.andP;  Syntax checks canbe performed during development without the full object-code generation.andP;  Aswitch allows generation of either Kandamp;R or ANSI C.andM;Comeau C++ is the only v. 2.1 release of C++ on the UNIX market.andP;  The verygood technical support will be useful to those who require hand-holding toget up and going, while the money-back guarantee gives a interestingincentive to try the Comeau compiler.andP;  It's also a competitively pricedproduct.andP;  The interactive version tested retails for $250.andP;  Other ports havedifferent prices.andM;The product installed cleanly and functioned perfectly every time.andP;  Itgenerated excellent C code and compiled perfectly in every case (assuming theC++ code passed the checks, of course).andP;  All in all, we were very pleased andrecommend the product.andM;Oregon C++ is a full compiler that generates a binary file from C++ input.andO;The package includes the preprocessor, compiler driver, compiler, postlinker,and debugger.andP;  Oregon C++ comes with a 90-day, money-back guarantee.andP;  Supportservices are on a contractual basis, with different levels of supportavailable.andP;  Technical support is available by phone, Oregon's BBS, and uucp.andM;Oregon C++ accepts both C++ and C source, with some compatibility issuescovered in the documentation.andP;  The native system's &quot; compiler isn't used.andM;The distribution media contains several items: the C++ debugger, apostlinker, and a copy of the public-domain object-oriented library developedby the National Institutes of Health.andP;  The Oregon C++ product requires 2MB ofdisk space, with an additional megabyte if the National Institutes of Healthlibrary is used.andP;  We tested the SCO XENIX/UNIX version.andM;A script file installs the product and gives the user choices fordirectories.andP;  The install script files won't create directories for you.andP;  Theinstallation uses tar to copy from the distribution media.andP;  The instructionsrecommend creating a new temporary directory to hold the files prior to fullinstallation.andP;  Two scripts are run, one for the compiler and one for theinclude files.andP;  Environment variables must be set up by the user.andM;The Oregon C+ + compiler generates C code written in Kandamp;R C, ANSI May 1988draft standard proposal C, and C+ + that conforms to the cfront 2.0.andP;  Thev.2.0 code-generation option doesn't support multiple inheritance.andM;A considerable number of compiler options let the Oregon system perform theuser's requirements.andP;  The compiler produces well-optimized code and seems tobe very efficient.andP;  Oregon's source-level debugger for C++ and C handlesobject-oriented code quite well.andP;  It supports the usual assortment ofdebugger capabilities and includes a short tutorial.andM;The Oregon compiler generated solid, tight binary programs from source.andP;  Thedebugger is a welcome aid to the programmer's toolkit.andP;  The 90-day,money-back guarantee also encourages programmers to try the Oregon product.andM;Intek C++, based on ATandamp;T's cfront v.2.0 generates C code, which the nativecompiler converts to an executable format.andP;  The Intek product is availableonly for UNIX System V/386, and requires a minimum of 2MB of RAM.andP;  Technicalsupport is available on uunet, CompuServe, and via telephone.andP;  The Intek UNIXversion is cross-compatible with its DOS version.andM;The Intek package consists of several diskettes that are installed using theregular install routines of the host UNIX version.andP;  Also included are fourshrink-wrapped sets of documentation.andP;  The Intek documentation consists oflarge sheets that are three-hole-punched.andP;  Our copy didn't include a binder.andO;Most of the documentation consists of standard ATandamp;T reprints: the C ++language system release 2.0 notes, product reference and library manuals, andselected readings.andP;  The Intek programmer's guide that accompanies the ATandamp;Tmaterial is about 25 pages long and covers the Intek C++ system.andP;  The Intekprogrammer's guide was somewhat terse.andM;The Intek C++ compiler uses a cfront translator, just like the ATandamp;T release.andO;This translator converts C++ code to C, after the preprocessor has expandedmacros and include files.andP;  The Intek compiler offers several options,including generating standard Kandamp;R C or ANSI C.andM;We tested the Intek compiler with the same program as the other two C++versions tested here, and it functioned as expected: the product caught allour intentional bugs and cleanly expanded the convoluted constructs we triedto throw its way.andM;A fourth C++ for UNIX is HCR C++ from SCO Canada.andP;  Documentation includesStanley Lippman's C++ Primer (Redding, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1989), a binderfor release notes and  selected readings&quot; on C++, a language referencemanual, and a manual for class library extensions.andM;SCO uses the standard ATandamp;T documents for the release notes and readings.andP;  Afew SCO-written pages cover installation of its product.andP;  The referencemanual and library reference are also ATandamp;T's.andP;  The class library extensionsare from SCO, NIH, and InterViews (a GUI library).andP;  SCO includes the dbXtradebugger (also originally from HCR) as a debugging tool.andP;  The SCO packagealso includes replacements for several standard UNIX tools: lexx ++, make ++,nm ++, prof ++ and yacc ++.andM;The class library extensions are comprehensive.andP;  The NIH library, is alsofound in the Oregon C++ compiler mentioned earlier.andP;  SCO adds the InterViewsClass Library, which provides extensive graphical interface tools.andP;  This is avery interesting library and certainly a valuable addition to the SCO C++.andO;The documentation is comprehensive and includes good user notes.andM;We have used HCR's dbXtra for several years now and find it a very goodsource level debugger.andP;  This is a welcome addition to the HCR package.andM;The complete SCO C++ package requires 3MB of disk space for the compiler, 2MBfor the debugger, and 3MB for the libraries.andP;  The compiler requires 512K ofRAM.andM;We tested SCO C++ under both SCO UNIX and Interactive 386/ix.andP;  Both performedvirtually identically, differing only in an operating-system-specific mannerfor the speed of compilation and execution.andP;  We put the SCO C + + through afew of the same tests we gave the other compilers in this review, and itperformed flawlessly with each.andP;  It's a solid product.andP;  An ATandamp;T 2.1-compliantversion was in late beta release at the time of review and should beavailable by the time you read this.andM;We have no difficulty recommending this compiler, and its presentation isexcellent.andP;  SCO's packaging and presentation are by far the best of the foursystems.andP;  The compiler is as good as the rest, but the add-on libraries(especially InterViews) provide excellent incentives to buy.andM;All four C++ compilers handled our test suites properly.andP;  The lack of  flash&quot;of the UNIX products, compared to some of the DOS C++ compilers availablesurprised (and disappointed) the entire test team.andP;  Certainly thedocumentation for most of these products lives up to UNIX stereotypes: terse,unfriendly, and seldom useful.andM;None of these products would provide a stand-alone environment for a newcomerto C++ : users would need additional books or manuals to learn C++ properly.andO;While the vendor isn't obligated to provide tutorials, instruction, orfriendliness in the documentation, one would expect the lessons learned inthe DOS market to filter through to the UNIX field.andP;  SCO's C++ does make someovertures to beginners, as it includes the Lippman book.andM;These products are deficient; they aren't.andP;  They all work well, and do whatis expected from a C++ compiler.andP;  They just lack sizzle.andM;So which UNIX compiler to try? Granted, we only looked at four out of almosta dozen, but the four we tested show that you can expect a solid product thatfunctions well.andM;Of the four, only Comeau's was shipping the newest release of the evolvinglanguage standard.andP;  (SCO's version was still in beta.) Oregon is one releaseback; Intek is two back.andP;  Comeau and Oregon offer money-back guarantees,which help make them safer choices,andM;The Oregon product generates binary directly.andP;  The package includes adebugger and has good documentation.andP;  The Comeau product offers BjarneStroustrup's The C++ Programming Language as a reference and is the leastexpensive of the four.andP;  Lifetime technical support is free with Comeau's C++.andO;HCR C+ + has a good heritage and has, by far, the best documentation.andM;Comeau Computing's C ++ has the little extras the others lack, includingcurrency with the latest ATandamp;T release, a low price, and a money-backguarantee.andP;  SCO's HCR C++ is also excellent, although significantly moreexpensive than Comeau's.andP;  For real development, this is the product.andP;  For amore tentative commitment, Comeau provides excellent value for the money.andP;  Onthe whole, though, we wish Borland International's Turbo C++  was availablefor UNIX !andP;  Tim Parker</TEXT></DOC>
