Soils in the Ozarks are usually saturated with water in thespring but those regions with low water retention capacities dry outby the end of summer and create a seasonally xeric environment. Theseareas are found on rhyolite bedrock, where soils are thin and rich incoarse material (15-55%), and on certain carbonate rocks, which tendto have cherty, impermeable residuum layers at depths of 0.6-1 meters,in the overlying soils. Individual leaf spectra show no discernible variationsin xeric as opposed to surrounding forests. The xeric forests exhibitflat-topped canopies and a more open understory. This physiognomic differencerelative to surrounding areas apparently controls the high near IR reflectances.Thus, the TM data, through surrogate measurements of forest type, providedirect and useful information about soils and bedrock in this area.</TEXT></DOC>
