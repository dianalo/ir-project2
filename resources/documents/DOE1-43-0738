Experiments were performed using narrow-bandsynchrotron radiation at 5, 20.8, 21, and 30 nm. Free-standing gold transmissiongratings served as waveguide structures. These structures had a 300-nmgrating period with waveguide channel widths as small as 100 nm and wereas thick as 700 nm in the direction of guided-wave transmission. Guided-wavephenomena were manifest in strongly asymmetric diffraction patterns resultingfrom the angular tilt of the transmission-grating normal from the incident-beamdirection.</TEXT></DOC>
