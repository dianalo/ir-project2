Finding: Section 202(t)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(1))prohibits payment of monthly benefits to any individual who is not a UnitedStates citizen or national for any month after he or she has been outsidethe United States for 6 consecutive months. This prohibition does not applyto such an individual where one of the exceptions described in section202(t)(2) through 202(t)(5) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)through 402(t)(5)) affects his or her case. Section 202(t)(2) of the Social Security Act provides that, subject tocertain residency requirements of section 202(t)(11), the prohibition againstpayment shall not apply to any individual who is a citizen of a countrywhich the Secretary of Health and Human Servcies finds has in effect asocial insurance or pension system which is of general application in suchcountry and which: (1) Pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, on accountof old age, retirement, or death; and (2) Permits individuals who are United States citizens but not citizensof that country and who qualify for such benefits to receive those benefits,or the actuarial equivalent thereof, while outside the foreign countryregardless of the duration of the absence. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has delegated the authorityto make such a finding to the Commissioner of Social Security. The Commissionerhas redelegated that authority to the Director of the International PolicyStaff. Under that authority the Director of the International Policy Staffhas approved a finding that Zaire (formerly the Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville)),beginning April 1, 1988, has a social insurance system of general applicationin effect which pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof,on account of old age, retirement, or death, but that under this socialinsurance system, citizens of the United States who are citizens of Zaireand who leave Zaire, are not permitted to receive such benefits, or theiractuarial equivalent, at the full rate without qualification or restrictionwhile outside that country. Accordingly, it is hereby determined and found that Zaire has in effect,beginning April 1, 1988, a social insurance system which meets the requirementsof section 202(t)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)(A)),but not the requirements of section 202(t)(2)(B) of the Act (42 U.S.C.402(t)(2)(B). This finding also affects the application of subparagraphs (A) and (B)of section 202(t)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(4) (A)and (B)). That section provides that, subject to certain residency requirementsof section 202(t)(11), section 202(t)(1) shall not be applicable to benefitspayable on the earnings record of an individual who has 40 quarters ofcoverage under Social Security or who has resided in the United Statesfor a period of periods aggregating 10 years or more. However, the provisionsof subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 202(t)(4) shall not apply to anindividual who is a citizen of a foreign country that has in effect a socialinsurance or pension system which is of general application in such countryand which satisfies the provisions of subparagraphs (A) of section 202(t)(2)but not the provisions of subparagraph (B) of section 202(t)(2). By Virture of the finding with respect to section 202(t)(2) herein, theprovisions of subparagraph (A) and (B) of section 202(t)(4) do not applyto citizens of Zaire beginning April 1, 1988. This revises our previous finding, published at 28 FR 9966 on September13, 1963, that Zaire (formerly known as the Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville))had in effect a social insurance or pension system that meets the requirementsof both subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 202(t)(2) of the Social SecurityAct.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> J.
