Air Force Gen. Paulo Roberto Camarinha, 65, was ousted Fridayafter giving a nearly one-hour interview Thursday night to thegovernment news agency EBN.   The announcement of the firing was made by Ronaldo Costa Couto,Sarney's chief of staff. He refused to give a reason for thedismissal and said only that a replacement would be named later.   In Thursday's interview, Camarinha criticized the planningminister and an economic program imposed by Sarney that froze thesalaries of civil servants to combat runaway inflation.   ``Salaries are frozen and prices shoot up everyday. To deny thisis impossible,'' he said in the interview. ``All you have to do isgo to the supermarket, the malls. Shops are empty. If things arelike this now, what's going to happen in 1989?''   Camarinha is one of six military ministers in thecivilian-controlled Cabinet of Sarney. He is the first militaryofficial to be fired under Sarney, who took office in 1985 when thearmed forces voluntarily returned to the barracks after 21 years inpower.   Camarinha, who has 44 years of service, is also the firsttop-ranking military officer to be publicly critical of the Sarneygovernment. In the armed forces, he was highly regarded and verypopular because he always stood up for their rights.   Rotated among the army, navy and air force, the position ofjoint chief of staff is not considered the most important militaryposts but it is one of the top six.   Army Minister Gen. Leonidas Goncalves was in China and hisministry refused to comment when contacted by telephone by TheAssociated Press. Goncalves is one of Sarney's closest advisers.   Sarney, who led the military-supported government party duringthe armed forces' regime, was chosen by the outgoing military asthe running mate of the late Tancredo Neves, who died before takingoffice.   Sarney, who became president in his place, seldom makesdecisions of great magnitude without consulting the military first.   There was no immediate comment from the other militaryministries.   Camarinha criticized congress and judicial system officials whoearn up to the equivalent of $7,000 a month. He called them``maharajas,'' a Portuguese term for corrupt officials.   He also criticized Planning Minister Joao Batista de Abreu forthe country's galloping inflation, expected to reach 600 percent bythe end of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
