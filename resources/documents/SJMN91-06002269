She wrote this article for the Baltimore Sun.Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     Consumers will be big winners when the new requirements for the nutrientlabel become effective.;    Old requirements will still be used, including&quot;serving size&quot; in standard, common household measures, &quot;number of servings percontainer&quot; and &quot;total calories.&quot;;    &quot;Percent RDA&quot; of vitamins A and C; the Bvitamins (niacin, thiamine and riboflavin); and minerals (calcium and iron)will disappear, because of space limitations and the fact that few Americanssuffer from vitamin deficiencies.;    Totals to be listed in grams;  Newrequirements that reflect current food-related health concerns will include&quot;total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol,&quot; &quot;sodium,&quot; &quot;total carbohydrates,complex carbohydrates and sugar,&quot; &quot;total protein&quot; and &quot;dietary fiber.&quot;;   Debate once raged over whether to use percentage of calories from fat, proteinand carbohydrate in grams. It is impossible to calculate the amount of fat youhave eaten in a day by adding up percentages.;    Fortunately, we will getgrams, which are easy to add up for an accurate picture.;    Women who aremaintaining normal weight average about 2,000 calories a day and should haveabout 43 grams of protein and no more than 66 grams of fat, with the remainderof food choices coming from carbohydrates. Most of the carbohydrates should becomplex (about 250 grams), with simple carbohydrates (sugars) limited to about50 grams.;    Men of normal weight average about 3,000 calories a day andshould have about 56 grams of protein and no more than 100 grams of fat, withthe remainder of choices coming from carbohydrates. Men too should get most oftheir carbohydrates from the complex sources (425 grams) and limit simplesugars to 75 grams.;    This new law will benefit consumers in several otherways:;    The Department of Health and Human Services must educate consumersabout the importance of the label information for maintaining healthful eatinghabits.;    The Food and Drug Administration must review scientificinformation to decide whether health claims, such as &quot;fiber prevents cancer,&quot;are valid and can appear on labels.;    True but misleading claims will beeliminated. For instance, the claim that solid vegetable shortening &quot;containsno cholesterol&quot; is true. But it contains large quantities of saturated fat,which raises blood cholesterol levels in many people.;    The validity ofhealth claims for vitamin and mineral supplements must be evaluated.;   Confusing terms such as &quot;lite,&quot; &quot;reduced&quot; and &quot;free&quot; must have standardmeanings when used on labels.;    The bad news, of course, is that this willtake a while. Proposed regulations will take one year. Final regulations willnot be completed for another six months. Only then will manufacturers knowenough about actual legal requirements to begin producing labels that meetconsumer needs.;    But it's a start!;     FERRETING OUT THE FAT; To figurewhat percent of calorie intake comes from fat, the consumer must total bothcalories and grams of fat. One gram of fat contains nine calories. Thecalculation showed that fat contribute 38 percent of the calories in thissample lunch -- well above the 30 percent recommended in governmentguidelines.; CHICKEN SALAD: 6 ounces chicken (estimated); 240 calories; 7grams fat; 2.2 grams saturated fat.; ICEBERG LETTUCE: One-quarter cup shredded(estimated); 1 calorie; 0 grams fat; TOMATO: 2 slices; 6 calories; Trace offat; No saturated fat; CHEDDAR CHEESE: 1 ounce; 115 calories; 9 grams fat; 6.1grams saturated fat; CROISSANT: 235 calories; 12 grams fat; 3.5 gramssaturated fat; SOFT DRINK: 12 ounces Classic Coca-Cola; 145 calories; No fat;PEACH YOGURT: 8 ounces (non-fat); 190 calories; Less than 1 gram fat; POTATOCHIPS: 1 ounce (15 chips); 173 calories; 12 grams fat; 3 grams saturated fat;TOTALS: CALORIES: 1205; FAT: 51.5 grams andequals; 38 percent of total calories;SATURATED FAT: 16.9 grams andequals; 13 percent of total calories.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  COLLEEN PIERRE  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910102  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  729  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 2, 199100002269,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
