Maj. Gen. Clive Milner, the Canadian commander of the U.N. forcethat has been on the Mediterranean island since 1964, said thelimited disengagement was ``an important first step'' towardreducing the chances of confrontation.   A U.N. statement said the Greek Cypriot National Guard and theTurkish Cypriot forces each pulled out of 12 observation posts inthree sectors along the dividing Green Line.   In some sections of the buffer zone, rival forces were only afew yards apart.   Government spokesman Akis Fantis said the withdrawal was ``afirst step toward the full demilitarization of Nicosia.''   Cyprus has been devided since July 1974, when the Turkish armyinvaded after a coup by militant Greek Cypriots seeking unity withGreece.   The Turks seized the northern third of the island. The minorityTurkish Cypriots, 18 percent of the 650,000 population, declared abreakaway republic there in 1983.   Milner said today's Nicosia withdrawal ``will help preventincidents and reduce tension in the city.''   It follows a sharp increase in violence along the 112-milebuffer zone that slices the island in two. The zone is patrolled by2,180 soldiers from nine countries in the U.N. Force in Cyprus.   A Greek Cypriot National Guard soldier shot and wounded aTurkish Cypriot soldier on the Green Line in Nicosia on May 7, thenkilled himself.   Five people were killed by gunfire between May and December lastyear, the same number of fatalities reported between 1976 and lastMay.   The limited pullback came amid reunification talks that aremaking little headway between President George Vassiliou, the GreekCypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.   The government was expected to begin repairing 60 houses aroundthe abandoned posts to encourage Greek Cypriots to return to thelong-deserted area.</TEXT></DOC>
