The new regulations would sharply increase maximum penalties for persons convicted of trading securities using nonpublic information. They also would broaden the definition of an &quot;insider.&quot;    &quot;In light of concerns raised by a widely publicized case of insider trading in the U.S., involving Ivan Boesky, . . . I would like to see this matter dealt with quickly,&quot; said Monte Kwinter, Ontario's minister of financial institutions.    Because Ontario's capital, Toronto, is Canada's business and financial center, Ontario's securities laws often set a trend for the whole country.    The proposals set a minimum fine equal to the profit made by the insider, and a maximum of $1 million (Canadian) or three times the profit, whichever is greater. A maximum jail sentence of two years was also proposed. Under existing law, the maximum penalty for offenders is one year in jail and/or a $2,000 fine for individuals and a $25,000 fine for corporations.    In addition, the existing law only provides for prosecution of an &quot;insider&quot; who acquires nonpublic information by virtue of his close connection with a company that issues securities. The new law would expand the definition of &quot;insider&quot; to include a person outside the company who gets privileged information from an inside source. </TEXT></DOC>
