The three-man panel ordered Saatchi, a London-based holding company for advertising and consulting concerns, to pay monetary damages to Mr. Jacoby. The decision, which is binding, said damages will be determined by arbitration at a future date. Damages won't exceed the value of the five-year personal-service contract, which industry sources estimated at $5 million to $7 million.    The panel's decision is the latest blow to Saatchi, which has seen its share price dip after news that it was rebuffed in two attempts to buy banks, and after the resignation of its top advertising officer last week. In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Saatchi closed at $27 a share, down 37.5 cents.    Since Mr. Jacoby's removal, Bates has been merged with another Saatchi advertising unit to form Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide. Donald M. Zuckert, who succeeded Mr. Jacoby and who now is president and chief operating officer of Backer, noted that the arbitrators merely ruled on the contract, and didn't vindicate Mr. Jacoby's behavior.    &quot;I think the decision is fair,&quot; Mr. Zuckert said. &quot;It is clear to me that they did breach his contract&quot; according to its narrow terms. Saatchi executives couldn't be reached for comment.    Saatchi removed Mr. Jacoby as chairman and chief executive officer of Bates last September, after he engineered an unauthorized, surprise management shakeup. Saatchi offered Mr. Jacoby a job within the parent organization, but his contract specifically called for him to remain Bates's top officer for five years.    Mr. Jacoby brought the matter up for arbitration, claiming Saatchi breached his contract. Saatchi countered that it had removed him for cause.    Several Bates executives went before the panel to detail the unauthorized shakeup and other issues, including Mr. Jacoby's alleged allotting of valuable Bates shares to at least one favored employee who didn't otherwise qualify.    In finding that Saatchi didn't show cause, the arbitration panel ruled that the company didn't prove Mr. Jacoby's actions had the &quot;effect of materially injuring the reputation, business or business relationships of Ted Bates within the meaning of his contract.&quot;    The panel also held that Mr. Jacoby can't go into advertising until Sept. 18, 1988, and can't take away Bates employees or clients until March 31, 1991, when his contract would expire. Mr. Jacoby, reached at his New Jersey home, said he was &quot;delighted&quot; with the decision. </TEXT></DOC>
