(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A business professor held hostage inBeruit for 20 months said Monday the collapse of Lebanesegovernmental and economic institutions led to his kidnapping in 1986.   Mithileshwar Singh, 61, said he hopes President Bush will directan effort to ``resolve the problems'' in Lebanon that have broughtthe kidnappings of Americans and other foreigners in the strife-torncountry.   ``Harmony cannot be gained through terrorism and the seizing ofhostages, but I do ask the governments to show more consideration''of conditions in Beruit, Singh said.   He said his captors ``have very little consideration for thefreedom of people. We were not allowed to go out of the room. Theirattitude was very commanding. It was, `Be a good hostage. Don't goover the limit set by us.'''   Singh said he wouldn't speculate on who was funding the groupthat held him prisoner.   He also declined to answer questions about escape attempts by himor other hostages. ``I would not like to comment at all aboutthis,'' he said.   ``The political process has come to a halt and there is no one toprovide safety and security to the millions of people living in thecountry,'' said Singh, who was released by the Islamic Jihad on Oct.3.   Singh, who taught at a now-defunct college in Grand Junction forseveral years and calls the western Colorado city home, was teachingat the American University of Beirut when he was abducted Jan. 24,1986.   A citizen of India, Singh has been a resident alien in the UnitedStates for more than a decade. He said pressure from the Indiangovernment, coupled with his age and poor health, were the likelyreasons for his release.   ``You can say there is no government in Lebanon. Economicinstitutions are falling apart,'' Singh said. ``In such a chaoticcondition, the country has become further subdivided into factions.''   As a result of many factions competing for control of thecountry, he said, his kidnappers were able to pose as securityguards at the university.   Singh said he and about eight other foreign instructors wereinvited to a meeting Jan. 24, 1986, by the chief of campus security.They were to discuss strengthened security and meet new guards hiredby the campus chief, Singh said.   Instead, Singh and the three other male instructors werehandcuffed at gunpoint and driven to an apartment, the first of 10places he would be held before he was released.   ``Our treatment was to some extent acceptable, but some of theconditions were intolerable and even indescribable,'' he said.   The captives were kept chained to the floor ``most of the time,''Singh said. They were freed only for bathroom trips and for transferto other apartments.   ``This caused great emotional and physical hardship,'' he said.   However, Singh said his captors provided medicine he and otherhostages needed for medical problems and brought him a doctor whenhe fell ``greatly sick.''</TEXT></DOC>
