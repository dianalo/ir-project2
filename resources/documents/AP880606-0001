(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic Govs. Richard Celeste of Ohio andMario Cuomo of New York proposed Monday that Midwestern statesvoluntarily cut power plant emissions blamed for acid rain in returnfor federal aid to institute the reductions.   The proposal is aimed at breaking a deadlock in Congress overcutting emissions that are believed responsible for acid rain in theeastern United States and Canada without economically crippling theMidwest, the two governors said in a joint statement.   Celeste said the proposal ``strikes the balance between the needto protect jobs and clean up the environment without hanging like aDamocles' sword over the coal industry.''   Cuomo called the agreement a ``terrific idea'' which he hopes canbe sold to other governors and to Congress.   The proposal will be introduced in Congress shortly as anamendment to the federal Clean Air Act by U.S. Sen. Daniel PatrickMoynihan, D-N.Y., said Gary Fryer, Cuomo's chief spokesman.   According to the two governors, the proposal calls for a 10million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-firedutility plants nationwide in three stages by the year 2003 and a 3million-ton reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions by 1998.   Officials say about 23 million tons of sulfur dioxide and about10 million tons of nitrogen dioxide are expelled into the atmospherenationally each year, with the biggest bulk emitted from severalMidwestern states.   The two governors estimated it would cost about $1.8 billion ayear to reduce emissions under the plan. They proposed thatpolluters would pay half that cost, the oil industry would pay $650million a year and the federal government would pay the remaining$250 million annually.   The proposal also calls for a 10-year, $2.5 billion expansion offederal ``clean coal'' programs to develop new technologies forreducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. That moneywould be handed out on a 50 percent matching-grant basis, the twogovernors said.   The plan calls for the federal Environmental Protection Agency toadminister the emissions reduction program.   Other proposed Clean Air Act amendments now being considered byCongress would require Midwestern states to meet stricter emissionslimits in a shorter time period.   ``People like Dick Celeste who are very pragmatic and very smart,they see coming down the road a heavier hit on them than our billwould propose,'' Cuomo said. ``Plus, they see a chance to have thefederal government pick up 50 percent of their costs of going to thenew technology. So it (the proposal) serves a lot of differentinterests at the same time.''   At a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, Celeste said the acidrain issue has been delayed too long by those who ``prefer what isgoing on in Ohio now _ nothing. We're tiptoeing past the graveyard''he said, adding the state's economy will suffer if a compromise isnot found.   Celeste admitted the plan would face stiff opposition fromutilities and coal producers and said he is willing to compromise aslong as some amount of federal funding is retained.   American Electric Power Co. said it would have to cancel plans tobuild the world's largest clean-coal plant, near New Haven, W.Va.,if the proposal is passed. The Columbus-based company also saidaverage electricity rates for customers of its eight subsidiaryutilities in seven states would increase as much as 15 percent.   New York is one of eight Northeastern states suing the EPA in theU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., to demand thatthe agency order seven Midwestern and Southern states to reducesulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants.   The agreement will not affect New York's pursuit of the suit,Cuomo administration officials said.   New York has claimed that hundreds of lakes in its AdirondackMountains have high acid levels that are dangerous to plant andanimal life.   Many environmentalists in the eastern United States and Canadamaintain that emissions coming mainly from the Midwest are carriedeastward by the wind and fall to the ground as acid rain or snow.</TEXT></DOC>
