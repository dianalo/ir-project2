(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state is looking for ways to keep itshigh school achievement tests under wraps after it was forced tocancel an exam when the answers were published in the New York Post.   The newspaper, saying it was showing that illicitly obtainedtests were widely available, published the answer sheet to achemistry test Tuesday, the day it was to be given to an estimated80,000 students across the state.   Officials probing the theft of the test results have found theexams were widely available to students in New York City, saidEducation Commissioner Thomas Sobol. Tests in biology, math, Frenchand global studies also were reported to be available, he said.   ``We are considering several measures which will improve oursecurity in the future,'' Sobol said.   Thomas Gilles, a spokesman for the state attorney general, saidthe office was investigating reports the tests and results werebeing sold for $2,000, although some tests were available for aslittle as $5 or $10 the night before the exam.   The regents tests, given in 17 subjects over a one-week period inlate June, are taken by high school students and generally accountfor a portion of a students' grade.   After the Post published the chemistry answers, they were quicklydistributed through copy and fax machines across the state, forcingonly the second cancelation in the test's history.   Jerry Nachman, editor of the Post, said it took a reporter 15minutes to find a copy of a test after he was assigned to checkreports they were stolen.   He said the test results were published on the front page as aservice to students who were planning to take the exam legitimatelywhen there was so much cheating going on.   ``Their inability to recognize the ingenuity of teen-agers,coupled with the proliferation of photocopiers and fax machines, wassilly,'' Nachman said.   Sobol said the department believed it could contain the damage toNew York City and that the tests could have been given elsewhere inthe state on Tuesday. But several hours after the newspaper waspublished, it became clear this was impossible, he said.   The Education Department is considering suing the Post for thecost of preparing and giving a replacement test, said Sobol'sspokeswoman, Linda Fisher. She estimated those costs at $250,000.   ``If they want to sue us, fine,'' Nachman said. ``I think thediscovery will be very revealing to us and all our colleagues in thepress.''   In Plattsburgh, near the Canadian border, Plattsburgh High Schooljunior Katie King said she was relieved, but the cancellation left anagging doubt.   ``In a way, I'm curious what I would have gotten on the regents... in a way I'm kind of disappointed,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
