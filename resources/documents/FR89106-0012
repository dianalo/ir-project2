Part 107 of the Federal Aviation Regulations waspromulgated to provide a secure environment in which air carriers can operate.Airport operators are required by Part 107 to have an FAA-approved airportsecurity program. The approved security program must describe the functionsand procedures to control access to certain areas of the airport and tocontrol movement of persons and vehicles within those areas. The PersonnelIdentification Procedures contained in airport security programs providea means of control once an individual has gained access to a restrictedarea. The FAA is concerned that these procedures could allow an individualusing forged, stolen, or noncurrent identification to compromise the securedareas. The FAA is also concerned that former employees could use theirfamiliarity with airline and airport procedures to succeed in enteringa secured area and possibly commit a criminal act on board an aircraft.The December 7, 1987, tragedy involving Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA)Flight 1771, in which 38 passengers and 5 crewmembers were killed afterdeparting Los Angeles International Airport, highlighted FAA's interestin improving the control of access to secured areas of an airport. An airportarea where access to aircraft and airport facilities is possible shouldbe accessible only to an individual who is authorized to be in that area.These areas should be controlled carefully to prevent tampering with aircraftand airport facilities and to preclude tragic consequences.The FAA accelerated its efforts to head off the type of situation potentiallyreflected by the crash of PSA Flight 1771 and to improve the level of securitygenerally. This acceleration resulted in the promulgation of an emergencyfinal rule amending the preboarding screening procedures contained in Parts108 and 129 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (52 FR 48508; December22, 1987). To complement the procedures required by that emergency regulationand to expand the performance standards of security systems at airports,on March 11, 1988, the FAA issued Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice)No. 88-6 (53 FR 9094; March 18, 1988). That notice proposed that airportoperators, whose airports met certain criteria, be required to submit tothe Administrator, for approval and inclusion in their approved securityprograms, amendments to their programs that ensure that only those personsauthorized to have access to secured areas of an airport are able to obtainthat access and also ensure that such access is denied immediately to individualswhose authority to have access changes. It further proposed that the programprovide for a means to differentiate between persons authorized to haveaccess to only a particular portion of the secured area and persons authorizedto have access only to other portions or to the entire secured area. Toprovide this increased control of locations on the airport, the FAA proposedin Notice No. 88-6 the installation of a computer-controlled card accesssystem. The notice also proposed that airport operators be allowed to installalternative systems which, in the Administrator's judgment, would havethe same capabilities as the computer-card system and would provide anequivalent level of security.Additionally, Notice No. 88-6 specifically stated that the proposal wouldsupplement, not replace, the existing photo identification system requiredby an airport operator's approved security program. The continuous displayof the individual identification in secured areas is necessary so thatunauthorized individuals can be challenged in accordance with andSection;107.13.However, the notice proposed that the airport operator be given the optionof integrating the system proposed by Notice No. 88-6 with the photo identificationsystem and issuing a single credential.  The anticipated capabilities of a computer-controlled card access systemwere discussed in Notice No. 88-6. In addition to being able to monitoreach location where access to the secured area is permitted by means ofa ``card reader'' linked to the control computer, the system would be designedto provide for unique coding for each card. The system would also be capableof performing other functions that can improve an airport's security profileincluding the ability to cause an alert when access is denied to a personwho attempts to use an invalid card and to establish a log of the system'sactivity. The notice intentionally did not address the details regardingthe actual locations of the card readers and the operational methods tobe employed by the system since each individual airport would employ asystem specific to its needs.  In Notice No. 88-6, the FAA proposed a 4-phase schedule for airport operatorsto submit to the Administrator amendments to their security programs. Thephases were based on the total number of persons screened annually at anairport. (The preamble to the proposed rule incorrectly stated ``numberof passengers screened'' annually.)  The notice proposed that, upon approval of the amendment by the Administrator,airport operators would fully implement their systems within 6 months fromthe date of approval. However, the Administrator could allow up to an additional6 months for implementation of the system at certain locations on eachairport. The intent was to ensure implementation at the most critical airportlocations and to allow additional time for implementation at locationsthat provide access to more remote locations on the airport.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments  </ITAG>As of May 31, 1988, the FAA received 122 written comments in response toNotice No. 88-6 from organizations representing the aviation industry,air carriers, individuals, manufacturers, and airports. The majority ofthe commenters object to the proposal either in part or in its entirety.They believe the proposal to be premature and lacking in its evaluationof complex issues. Numerous commenters support the intent of the proposedrule but express concern because it lacked specificity about the requirementsand because they made incorrect assumptions about the scope of the requirements.The following discussion is intended to address the comments and explainthe FAA's response to the concerns identified in the 122 comments receivedthrough May 31, 1988. The FAA has reviewed and considered late-filed commentsto determine if any new issues were raised or any significant, new factualinformation was provided.  Six commenters request a 60-day extension of the May 2, 1988, closing datefor comments on Notice No. 88-6 including requests from the American Associationof Airport Executives (AAAE), the Airport Operators Council International(AOCI), and the Regional Airline Association (RAA). A letter was also receivedfrom the Air Transport Association (ATA) in support of the AAAE and AOCIrequests. They comment that, considering the magnitude of the issue, moretime is needed to allow for wider distribution and discussion, to prepareadditional information concerning the costs associated with the proposedsystem, and to allow maximum comments and facilitate an open exchange ofideas. The FAA denied the requests for extension. However, the FAA continuedto consider late-filed comments beyond July 2, the date on which the requestedextension period would have expired.  Twelve commenters are recommending that Notice No. 88-6 be withdrawn toallow time for the FAA, airport operators and tenants, and other interestedparties to explore the total security problem that might exist at airports.At least three commenters are requesting a public hearing which they believewill allow them to air their concerns and expose pertinent issues therebyproviding the FAA and the aviation community with necessary information.Ten commenters specifically request the FAA to conduct a study of the technologythat is available regarding automated access control systems to determinethe most appropriate system to accomplish the objective of the proposals.Several commenters, including the ATA and AAAE, recommend that the FAAconduct a pilot program at several airports to evaluate more realisticallythe issues involved in this rulemaking.      While worthy of merit under less compelling circumstances, the implementationof any of these recommendations would result in the postponement of a securitymeasure intended to promote the safety of air transportation and thereforemust be balanced carefully against that goal. The information that wouldbe provided to the FAA through a public hearing would duplicate, to a largeextent, that already contained in Docket No. 25568. Through its experienceat more than a dozen major airports and other facilities, the FAA has beenmade aware of most of the existing technology regarding computerized accesscontrol systems and is confident that technology is available to meet therequirements of this final rule. Additionally, the FAA historically hasbeen reviewing and evaluating all aspects of an airport operator's securityprogram to ensure that it is commensurate with the size, layout, location,and activity level of the particular airport. Consequently, the FAA fullyexpects to be involved early on regarding the scope and design of a systemthat meets the required performance standards or an approved alternativethat will comply with the final rule. From its historical role, as wellas its early participation in the process outlined in this final rule,the FAA believes that the requirements of this rulemaking are both realisticand supportable.The FAA plans also to issue general guidelines to assist airport operatorsin their selection of a system, method, or procedure and preparation ofan amendment. The guidelines also will assist FAA personnel in their reviewand approval of the amendment containing an airport operator's proposedstrategy to install and implement a system, method, or procedure that meetsthe performance standards or an approved alternative. In summary, the FAA'sinput and involvement at the very early stage will address many of thecommenters' concerns that might otherwise argue for delaying final action.Funding was another concern identified by 46 commenters. Most of them indicatethat the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) would be their only source offunding. Many airport managers make reference to the notice which statesthat the proposed system would be eligible for funding under AIP; however,their concern is that the amount of AIP funding available would not coverall costs. Commenters also express concern that other airport improvementprojects would be impeded due to the diversion of AIP funds. Several ofthe commenters recommend that the FAA consider making other funds availableif a final rule is issued. Lastly, the commenters state that the shortimplementation schedule proposed in the notice could make AIP funding impossibledue to the amount of time needed to process such requests.The majority of the airports covered by this rule are primary airports.These airports, particularly the larger ones, have historically fundedmuch or most of their capital development without Federal financial aid.In addition, primary airports receive entitlement funds each year underthe AIP. It is expected that these airport sponsors would use the AIP entitlementsor their own resources to fund required security capital costs. To theextent that these resources are not adequate at smaller airports and dependingon the availability of other funding sources within the AIP, the FAA wouldconsider supporting the program with funding, as necessary. Since the finalrule includes a revised implementation schedule, the FAA believes thatnormal funding within the AIP should be sufficient to aid airports, anda ``set aside'' fund is not necessary.Fifty-eight commenters are concerned about the costs that would be involvedto achieve compliance with the requirement being proposed. They believethe cost figures reflected in the notice to be underestimated. Severalcommenters, including the ATA, AAAE, and AOCI, provide details of estimatedcosts. Those organizations indicate that the FAA cost estimates are underestimatedby as much as a factor of 10. For that reason, the commenters believe thatthe Regulatory Evaluation is not accurate. They also state that the regulationbeing proposed meets the criteria for a major regulation under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and, therefore, requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis.In response to the concerns regarding the estimated costs of the proposal,the FAA reviewed further the data contained in its Regulatory Evaluation.The results of that review are reflected in the evaluation for the finalrule. A summary of the Regulatory Evaluation is included in this preambleunder the heading ``Economic Summary.''The concerns identified by the commenters regarding the implementationof the proposal reflect the extremely tight timeframe proposed in NoticeNo. 88-6. Twenty-nine commenters contend that the unrealistic schedulemakes compliance impossible considering the time-consuming process involvedfor budgeting, designing, bidding, procuring, and installing a system.Several commenters are recommending 2 years in addition to the time proposedin Notice No. 88-6. One commenter recommends that the compliance time forthis requirement be 3 years following the allocation of dedicated AIP funds.The FAA agrees with the commenters regarding their concerns about the implementationschedule proposed in Notice No. 88-6. Accordingly, the final rule containsa revised implementation schedule. The revised schedule constitutes a significantchange from the language proposed in Notice No. 88-6.Thirteen commenters express concern for the effectiveness of a system thatairport operators might be forced to implement if they are subject to theschedule proposed in the notice. If 269 airports were required to complywith the schedule as proposed in the notice, the overdemand for qualifiedvendors would require using inexperienced contractors and companies. Thecommenters are in favor of extending the time period for implementationsince compliance with the proposed schedule could have a detrimental effecton the system quality and reliability, especially at medium- and small-sizedairports.The FAA considers these concerns to be valid, and as stated above, theschedule contained in the final rule is revised. Current data indicatethat 270 airports would be required to comply with a final rule.The performance standards associated with a computer-controlled card accesssystem causes serious concerns for at least 14 of the commenters. Ninecommenters believe the time-date requirement for controlling access tobe impractical due to necessary adjustments in work schedules to meet demands.Their specific concern is for the impact it will have on day-to-day operations;e.g., reassigning staff personnel, using different gates for delayed flights,working overtime, and changing workshifts.If a computer-controlled card system is selected by an airport operatorto meet the requirements of the final rule, the FAA anticipates that thesystem would be designed to have unique coding for each card so that thecomputer can be reprogrammed in minutes to revise the access authorizedby a specific card. Such details will be developed in the context of theamendment to an airport's approved security program and will take intoaccount the need for operational flexibility. The FAA plans to issue generalguidelines on system operation.Many of the commenters express concern for terminology contained in thenotice. ``Secured area'' is not defined in Part 107 or 108 of the FAR.Two commenters request a definition of ``immediately'' which is statedin the proposal to indicate when access should be denied to individualswhose authority changes. Other commenters express concern regarding theuse of the word ``airports'' versus ``airport operators'' in the preambleto Notice No. 88-6. Twenty commenters are concerned about an apparent conflictthat centers around the airport operator's responsibilities for securityunder Part 107 and those of air carriers subject to Part 108 who have enteredinto exclusive use agreements with airport operators. The commenters urgethe FAA to clarify this issue before proceeding with a final rule. Onecommenter requests standardization by the FAA in its interpretation ofa final rule.The FAA intentionally did not define ``secured area'' in the notice, noris it defined in the final rule. To do so could result in the compromiseof airport operators' security programs. Use of the term ``immediately''is intended to stress the urgency with which an airport operator shouldact to deny access to secured areas by unauthorized individuals. The preambleto Notice No. 88-6 used the phrase ``in a matter of minutes.'' Althoughthe FAA has not further defined this term in the final rule, the FAA believesthat the time interval should be the reasonable minimum time necessaryto adjust the database to deny access to an individual. Regarding the useof the word ``airport,'' the FAA agrees that the preamble statement referencedby the commenters creates confusion. However, the proposed rule and thefinal rule clearly establish that the regulated entity is the airport operator.Finally, the FAA does not view the use of the term ``airport operator''as being inappropriate notwithstanding that an airport operator may haveentered into an exclusive use agreement with an air carrier. When enteringinto an exclusive use agreement, the air carrier must accept the controlsand procedures levied upon it by the airport operator. In such a case,the airport operator may be required to establish additional controls ormodify existing ones for selected areas of an airport to comply with thisfinal rule.The FAA agrees with the commenter who requests that the FAA standardizeits interpretation of a final rule to prevent serious differences in itsimplementation. The FAA will accomplish the requested standardization throughthe issuance of guidance to the various FAA regions for dissemination tothe civil aviation security inspectors.A number of commenters express concern that individuals who ordinarilyhave access at several airports (such as crewmembers or officials of amultiairport jurisdiction) would need a card for each airport. At leastfive commenters recommend that a commonality exist among the systems topreclude possible confusion and inconvenience stemming from individualsystems which deny access to the above individuals. The commenters, inessence, recommend that the FAA require access control systems that arecompatible on a national basis.The FAA does not agree at this time that imposing uniformity is warranted.First, it would require imposing a uniform type of system, e.g., a computer-controlledcard system. Moreover, requiring each airport to have a system with nationwidecapacity and compatibility (capable of storing hundreds of thousands ofnames) would drive system costs up and would benefit only a small segmentof the individuals who are associated with the regulated entities. Moreover,since the final rule expands the opportunity to use an alternative system,method, or procedure in response to the comments, nationwide uniformityis not practicable. However, an effort is underway to study the feasibilityof an access system with multiairport capabilities. The FAA anticipatesthat operational issues will be identified in the study.Twenty commenters address the issue of alternative access control systemsthat provide an equivalent level of security. Many of these commenters,including operators of small airports, state that nonautomated systemsshould be permitted. They believe that the requirement for the alternativeto have the same capabilities as a computer-controlled card system is toorestrictive. Ten comments were received from people who are in the businessof providing systems for access control. The intent of these commentersis to make the FAA aware of technologies that are available, and, moreimportantly, to recommend that a final rule not require one type of systemwhile allowing others to be used by exception as proposed in Notice No.88-6.The FAA agrees that, in addition to the specific technology identifiedin Notice No. 88-6, others may be available to meet the objectives of theproposal. The FAA also envisions that operators of the smaller airportsmay be able to meet the requirements of this final rule with minimal orno computer-assisted hardware installation. The final rule is revised accordingly.The lack of specificity regarding the doors, gates, or other locationsthat would be involved in the implementation of the proposed system isof concern to 24 commenters. They contend that the number of access pointsto be controlled will significantly impact the cost of the system. Theyalso express concern about the applicability of a rule to those pointsthat give access to various suppliers who are making daily deliveries totenants in a restricted area and to the current escort procedures thatprovide construction workers with daily or temporary access to restrictedareas. Seven commenters believe the proposal to be in conflict with firecodes.For the same reason that ``secured area'' was not defined, the FAA wasnot specific regarding doors, gates, and other locations to be controlled.To do so would compromise an airport operator's security program. For thatreason, the FAA specifically requested that airport operators not discussin their comments specific details of current or proposed security arrangements.The FAA-planned guidance for the various FAA regions will assist the FAApersonnel and airport operators in the identification of those access pointsthat should be subject to control by the system, method, or procedure requiredby this final rule. The FAA does not envision that every door or otheraccess point will need the enhanced access controls. In response to theconcern regarding suppliers, the intended effect of the requirement proposedby the notice will not allow the FAA to consider the inconvenience of sucha requirement to any one group. Escort procedures are associated with anairport's identification system, and Notice No. 88-6 stated that the proposalwould supplement, not replace, an existing identification system requiredby an airport operator's security program. Escorting of persons will continueto be permitted under the rule.Twenty-nine commenters state that the complicated and expensive automatedsecurity measures proposed by the notice are not necessary at small airportssince small airports experience different types of problems than do largeairports. Nineteen commenters specifically state that the current proceduresare adequate and that the level of security anticipated by the FAA throughthe final rule can only be obtained via greater discipline of personneland more training on security issues. Six commenters recommend an evaluationof different airports to determine the scope of security needs and to giveconsideration to the complexity of operations before effecting a rule torequire all airports to have a complex and expensive computer-controlledsystem.The FAA agrees with the commenters and recognizes that security variesfrom airport to airport. The final rule is revised to permit FAA approvalof an alternative system, method, or procedure that provides an appropriatelevel of security commensurate with an airport's needs.At least three commenters express concern that Notice No. 88-6 does notaddress the impact on fixed based operators (FBO) and request clarificationof this issue. Eleven commenters express the same concern for general aviation(GA) operations.Upon adoption of a final rule, the airport operator would be the regulatedparty. As tenants of the airport, FBO's and GA operations would be subjectto the control procedures identified by the airport operator.Seventeen commenters state that the required system will not prevent aperson from violating security measures if that person has such a desire.At least three commenters state that the required system will not preventthe PSA Flight 1771 type of tragedy.The FAA believes that the emergency final rule amending the preboardingscreening procedures complemented by the requirements of this rule to requireairport operators to implement a positive access control system will substantiallyincrease the overall level of security and will minimize the likelihoodof a PSA Flight 1771 type of situation.Finally, 11 persons comment that the proposed regulation will, at the veryleast, enhance security to a minimal degree. They contend that in somecases security will deteriorate if all issues involved at any one airportare not considered in the system design and implementation.The FAA believes that the final rule will enhance airport security beyonda minimal degree since its intent is to preclude access to secured areasby unauthorized persons. Since the commenters did not identify the specificissues to be considered to prevent a deterioration of security, the FAAcannot adequately respond to that concern.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Rule</ITAG>After considering the comments, the FAA is amending Part 107 to add a newandSection; 107.14 to require improved access control to secured areas ofcertain airports. The final rule revises the proposed rule in several significantrespects as a result of the comments received.<T3>Section 107.14(a).</T3> Paragraph (a) of andSection; 107.14 is revisedin three ways from the proposal. First, the amendment to an airport operator'sapproved security program is to be submitted to the Director of Civil AviationSecurity rather than the Administrator. The substitution of the Directorof Civil Aviation Security for the Administrator has been made throughoutandSection; 107.14. Second, the last two sentences of proposed paragraph(a), dealing with the timeframe for implementation of a required system,have been deleted. The implementation schedule is found in paragraph (c)of andSection; 107.14 of the final rule and is discussed below. Third, therequirement of paragraph (a) that certain airport operators submit, forapproval and inclusion in their approved security programs, amendmentsthat provide for the installation and use of a computer-controlled cardsystem for access to secured areas of the airport, has been modified. Paragraph(a) now requires the installation and use of a system, method, or procedurethat meets specified performance standards to control access to securedareas of the airport. This change allows the installation and use of systems,methods, or procedures other than computer-controlled card systems whichmay be currently available or that become available in the future as technologyevolves and that meet the performance standards.<T3>Section 107.14(b).</T3> Paragraph (b) of andSection; 107.14 addressesthe approval of alternative systems, methods, or procedures. The finalrule reflects major changes from the proposed rule as a result of commentsreceived. Approval of an alternative under the final rule is not tied tohaving the same capabilities as the system, method, or procedure meetingthe performance standards of paragraph (a). This permits approval of otherthan automated systems. However, the critical element for approval of anyalternative is the same in the final rule as it was in the proposed rule;the alternative must provide an overall level of security equal to thatwhich would be provided by the type of system, method, or procedure describedin paragraph (a).<T3>Section 107.14(c). </T3>Paragraph (c) of the proposed rule sets forththe schedule for airport operators to submit the amendments to their approvedsecurity programs required by paragraph (a) or (b). The final rule retainsthe 4-phase approach and the timeframes for airports subject to each phaseto submit their amendments. Airport operators may submit their amendmentsprior to the date required by this final rule. For example, since someairport operators will be able to meet the requirements of the rule withoutinstalling a system, method, or procedure that meets the performance standardsof paragraph (a), and will be able to meet the intent of the rule on amuch faster timeframe, they are encouraged to submit their plans beforethe dates required by the final rule.Operators of Phase I airports, where 25 million or more persons are screenedannually or as designated by the Director of Civil Aviation Security, mustsubmit amendments by 6 months after the effective date of the final rule.Operators of Phase II airports, where more than 2 million persons are screenedannually, must submit amendments by 6 months after the effective date ofthe final rule. Operators of Phase III airports, where 500,000 to 2 millionpersons are screened annually, must submit amendments by 12 months afterthe effective date of the final rule. Operators of Phase IV airports, whereless than 500,000 persons are screened annually, must submit amendmentsby 12 months after the effective date of the final rule.Paragraph (c) of the final rule also includes an implementation schedule.The implementation timeframe, which was in paragraph (a) of the proposedrule, is substantially revised in the final rule. The proposed rule providedthat ``the system must be in use within 6 months'' after approval of anairport operator's amendment to its approved security program. The proposedrule also provided for an additional 6 months at certain locations on anairport. The short timeframe of the proposed rule applied to airports inall four phases.The final rule is different in several major respects. First, the implementationschedule is now linked to the phases. The final rule provides that thesystem, method, or procedure must be fully operational within 18 monthsafter approval of an airport operator's amendment to its approved securityprogram only at Phase I airports. Operators of Phase II airports have 24months after approval of the amendments to their approved security programs.Operators of Phase III and IV airports have 30 months. The approved amendmentfor each airport shall specify how the system, method, or procedure willbe fully operational within the appropriate timeframe.Finally, paragraph (c) has added language to address the situation wherean existing airport becomes subject to the requirements of andSection; 107.14after the effective date of the final rule. The timeframes for such anairport operator to submit an amendment to its approved security programand to specify that the system, method, or procedure must be fully operationaldepend on the phase that is applicable to the airport.<T3>Section 107.14(d). </T3>A new paragraph (d) is included in the finalrule to address the situation of brand new airports commencing operationsafter December 31, 1990. It is FAA's view that new airports should meetthe requirements of section 107.14 when they commence operations sincethe improved access control requirements of the rule can be included inthe design for these new airports and at a lower cost than a subsequentretrofit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Summary</ITAG>The following is a summary of the final cost impact and benefit assessmentof this rule amending Part 107 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to provideenhanced control of access to secured areas at certain U.S. airports. Afull regulatory evaluation has been inserted into the public docket forthis rulemaking.For purposes only of this evaluation, the projected economic impact ofthe rule is based on the costs of installing and operating a computer-controlledcard access system. Other access control systems, methods, or proceduresmay be permitted as a means of compliance with this rule subject to theapproval of the Director of Civil Aviation Security.Fifty-eight of the 122 written comments received as of May 31, 1988, inresponse to Notice No. 88-6 published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 18, 1988, pertain to the economic impactof the proposal. These comments were submitted by industry associations,individual airport authorities, air services, and producers of airportsecurity equipment. The vast majority of these comments generally statethat the FAA had underestimated the total costs required for compliancewith the proposed rule.Many of these comments are premised on two basic assumptions: (1) Thatthe FAA underestimated the cost per access point, and (2) that the FAAunderestimated the number of access points requiring enhanced control atairports.The FAA has carefully reviewed its own cost estimates in light of commentsreceived and does not agree that it underestimated the cost per accesspoint. The FAA's estimates of design, testing, hardware, installation,maintenance, software update, and security card replacement costs werebased on price quotes of manufacturers of computer card access systems.Cost per access area will differ for airports of different sizes, due tothe large number of variables in required equipment, labor and maintenanceand structural alterations associated with retrofit of existing systems.Thus, it is misleading to estimate total costs of the proposed rulemakingbased on the cost per access area of one or two airports, as was done bysome commenters.Regarding the number of access points, the FAA believes that several commentersmisunderstand the scope of the proposed rulemaking and have therefore overestimatedthe number of access points that the rule would require to have enhancedaccess controls (system, method, or procedure). In determining the numberof doors that would be affected, the FAA did not envision that every doorin a terminal area would need to be so controlled. Rather, the design ofmany airport buildings permits a ``funneling through'' effect which wouldminimize the number of doors requiring such enhanced control. In general,funnelling persons through a single point with enhanced access controlsto an area would eliminate the need to have such controls at subsequentdoors.Therefore, for its economic analysis of the final rule, the FAA has notrevised its estimates of the average number of access points that wouldneed to be controlled in the four categories of airports. The number ofaccess points for airports of each phase remains as follows in the economicanalysis of the final rule:<ITAG tagnum="14">Phase I: 128 access points</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Phase II: 60 access points</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Phase III: 25 access points</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Phase IV: 10 access points</ITAG>Several airport operators comment that the cost of the required securitymeasure described in Notice No. 88-6 is excessive and would impose a heavyfinancial burden on them. The FAA recognizess these concerns and has thereforeemphasized in the final rule that an airport operator may submit an amendmentto its security program for approval by the Director of Civil AviationSecurity, which does not necessarily require a computer card or automatedsystem. The Director of Civil Aviation Security may approve such an alternativesystem, method, or procedure if, in the Director's judgment, it providesan overall level of security equal to that of a system, method or proceduremeeting the performance standards outlined in the final rule. These performancestandards, although stringent, do not specifically require use of a computerizedor automated system.In addition, the implementation schedule for affected airports has beenrevised in the final rule to allow more time for compliance, particularlyfor medium- and small-sized airports. One positive effect of this changemay be to spread up-front costs for installation over a longer period oftime, easing the burden on many airport operators. <ITAG tagnum="84">Costs</ITAG>This analysis of the costs of compliance with the final rule is premisedon the assumption that all 270 airports will install computer-controlledcard access systems. In actuality, many airport operators, particularlyof medium- and small-sized airports in Phases III and IV, may install alternativeaccess control systems, methods, or procedures, with the approval of theDirector of Civil Aviation Security, that may prove to be less costly thanthe computer card systems. Therefore, the actual costs of this rule maybe less than the estimated costs in this analysis.Estimated costs of implementing controlled access systems at 270 airportsin the United States, in accordance with the specifications and revisedschedule of new andSection; 107.14, are $169.9 million in 1987 dollars, and$119.1 million discounted present value (employing a 10 percent discountrate), for the 10-year evaluation period from 1989-1998. For Phase I airports,average hardware and installation costs are expected to be $1,465,600,with average annual recurring costs of approximately $126,600. For PhaseII airports, average hardware and installation costs are expected to be$732,000, with annual recurring costs of approximately $88,730. For PhaseIII airports, average hardware and installation costs are expected to be$245,000, with annual recurring costs of approximately $42,969. For PhaseIV airports, average hardware and installation costs are expected to be$56,000, with annual recurring costs of approximately $3,100. Table I showsthe total of these costs by phase of airport and by year for the 270 airportsaffected by this rule.The revised implementation schedules specified in this rule for airportsof the four phases, permitting installation, maintenance and labor coststo commence later than indicated in the Initial Regulatory Evaluation,have the effect of slightly reducing the present value of total costs.Nonetheless, overall estimated costs of compliance have increased fromestimates in the Initial Regulatory Evaluation, as a result of an increasein the number of airports in each phase. According to a recent review,there are 17 rather than 16 airports in Phase I, 54 rather than 48 airportsin Phase II, 46 rather than 45 airports in Phase III, and 153 rather than160 airports in Phase IV.<ITAG tagnum="84">Benefits</ITAG>The primary benefit of this rule will be the prevention of potential fatalitiesand injuries and the destruction of property resulting from a criminalact or an act of air piracy. The tragic loss on December 7, 1987, of 38passengers and 5 crewmembers aboard PSA Flight 1771, serves as a basisfor focusing on the type of catastrophic event that may be prevented byadopting new security regulations. It is important to recognize that thePSA Flight 1771 incident involved a smaller aircraft and passenger loadthan a typical Part 121 air carrier operation. If such a criminal act wereperpetrated in a larger or more heavily loaded aircraft, the casualty losswould have been significantly higher.The estimated $119.1 million cost (discounted present value) of this rulecan be recovered fully if one incident, involving the loss of 170 livesand a wide-bodied jet transport of the type typically used in domesticoperations, is prevented as a result of requiring improved security programsat U.S. airports during the 10 years following adoption of this rule. Thisdetermination is based upon a minimum value of $1.0 million per life saved,used in FAA regulatory evaluations, and an aircraft hull value of approximately$30.0 million, discounted from the middle of the 10-year evaluation periodto account for the uncertainty of when such an incident may be prevented.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination</ITAG>This amendment would affect 270 of the 427 airports subject to the securityprovisions of Part 107. The FAA's small entity size standards criteriondefine a small airport as one owned by a county, city, town or other jurisdictionwith a population of 49,999 or less. Applying the FAA's size thresholdcriterion, 76 of the 427 airports are small. Since only 22 of the 270 airportsthat would be required to comply with this proposal are small, the requirementfor the enhanced access controls will not affect a substantial number (atleast one third) of the 76 small airports subject to Part 107. Therefore,this final rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive ornegative, on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table I._Cost of Computer-Controlled Card Access Systems for Years1989-1998</T4><H1>Year</H1><H1>Phase I</H1><H1>Phase II</H1><H1>Phase III</H1><H1>Phase IV</H1><H1>Total Costs</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1989 <D>\2\ $9,444,067 </D><D>$13,417,920 </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>$22,861,987</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990 <D>\2\ 18,599,133 </D><D>\2\ 24,312,420 </D><D>\2\ 5,359,491 </D><D> </D><D>48,271,044</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1991 <D>\1\ 1,989,000 </D><D>\2\ 14,430,420 </D><D>\2\ 5,646,991 </D><D> </D><D>22,066,411</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1992 <D>1,989,000 </D><D>\1\ 4,548,420 </D><D>\2\ 5,646,991 </D><D>\2\ 8,698,050 </D><D>20,882,461</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1993 <D>1,989,000 </D><D>4,548,420 </D><D>\1\ 1,890,324 </D><D>\1\ 359,550 </D><D>8,787,294</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1994 <D>2,641,800 </D><D>4,548,420 </D><D>1,890,324 </D><D>359,550 </D><D>9,440,094</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1995 <D>1,989,000 </D><D>5,520,420 </D><D>1,890,324 </D><D>359,550 </D><D>9,759,294</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1996 <D>1,989,000 </D><D>4,548,420 </D><D>2,235,324 </D><D>818,550 </D><D>9,591,294</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1997 <D>1,989,000 </D><D>4,548,420 </D><D>1,890,324 </D><D>359,550 </D><D>8,787,294</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1998 <D>2,641,800 </D><D>4,548,420 </D><D>1,890,324 </D><D>359,550 </D><D>9,440,094</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Cost (1987 dollars) <D>45,260,800</D><D>84,971,700 </D><D>28,340,416 </D><D>11,314,350 </D><D>169,887,266</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Cost (present value; 10% discount rate) <D>33,345,586 </D><D>60,267,176 </D><D>18,312,651 </D><D>7,224,445 </D><D>119,149,858</D><F>\1\ Recurring annual costs include security access card replacement,computer maintenance, software update and support, and additional labor.Recurring costs also include card readers maintenance every 4th year.</F><F>\2\ One-time installation costs include planning and procurement ofcomputers, peripheral equipment, card readers, security access cards, engineeringsite survey and design, and Manager/Operator training.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Trade Impact Statement  </ITAG>This rule is expected to have no impact on trade opportunities for bothU.S. firms doing business overseas and foreign firms doing business inthe United States. This amendment affects only certain domestic airportssubject to Part 107 of the FAR. Since there is virtually no foreign competitionfor the services provided by U.S. domestic airports, there is expectedto be no impact on trade opportunities for either U.S. firms overseas orforeign firms in the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reporting and Recordkeeping  </ITAG>The requirements in the current regulations (Part 107) for an airport operatorto submit an airport security program and amendments to the FAA for approvalwere approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under ControlNo. 2120-0075. Pursuant to this final rule, the FAA forwarded an amendmentto Control No. 2120-0075 to OMB in accordance with the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511). OMB approved the FAA's amendment of ControlNo. 2120-0075 on January 3, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications  </ITAG>The FAA believes that airport operators and sponsors will not be undulyburdened by the requirements of the final rule based on (1) the availabilityof AIP funding; (2) potential lower costs associated with alternative systems,methods, or procedures; and (3) the extended implementation schedule providingamortization of installations costs. On these bases, the FAA has determinedthat this regulation will not have a substantial direct effect on the States,on the relationship between the National Government and the States, oron the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparationof a Federalism assessment is not warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion  </ITAG>For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings inthe Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade ImpactAnalysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not major underExecutive Order 12291. In addition, it is certified that this rule willnot have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantialnumber of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980. Because of the substantial public interest resulting fromNotice No. 88-6, this rule is considered significant under the DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). A copy of thefinal regulatory evaluation of the rule, including a Regulatory FlexibilityDetermination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT''</T2>.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 107  </ITAG>Transportation, Air safety, Safety, Aviation safety, Air transportation,Air carriers, Aircraft, Airports, Airplanes, Airlines, Aviation security,Secured areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Amendment  </ITAG>Accordingly, Part 107 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part107) is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 107_AIRPORT SECURITY  </ITAG>1.
