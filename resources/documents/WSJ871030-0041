The company, which makes environmental quality controls and energy-conversion systems, said it will build a 25.8-megawatt combined-cycle power plant in Kern County, Calif., for MidSun Partners L.P., a California-based limited partnership. Work is expected to begin next March and be completed in December 1988.    In the second project, the company will rehabilitate four steam generators owned by Montenay Power Corp. of Miami. The four units are expected to be overhauled by September 1989, Zurn said. </TEXT></DOC>
