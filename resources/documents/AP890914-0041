Jesse Helms' effort tobar federal subsidies for sexually explicit or blasphemous art _ butthe fight is far from over.   The House voted 264-153 Wednesday to reject Helms' proposedrestrictions on the National Endowment for the Arts.   ``We're telling Jesse we respect freedom of expression,'' Rep.Don Edwards, D-Calif., said afterward.   However, the chief House supporter of Helms' measure predicts atleast one more vote on the highly charged battle over theendowment's awarding of $45,000 this year to help finance twocontroversial exhibits.   ``The debate now shifts to the hinterland,'' said freshman Rep.Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif. ``I believe Sen. Helms has a few rabbitsup his sleeve.''   For two months, a coalition of Christian, conservative andRepublican groups have campaigned for Helms' amendment to the Senateversion of a 1990 appropriations bill for the endowment, theInterior Department and several other agencies.   Organizations supporting the arts also mobilized a campaigncasting the issue as a battle over artistic freedom.   Helms' measure would ban federal subsidies of ``obscene orindecent material, including ... depictions of sadomasochism,homoeroticism, the exploitation of children or individuals engagedin sex acts.''   It also would prohibit taxpayer funding of art that ``denigratesthe objects or beliefs of ... a particular religion or non-religionor ... a person, group or class of citizens on the basis of race,creed, sex, handicap or national origin.''   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., the endowment's chief supporter in theHouse, said it erred in awarding grants for the two exhibits _ oneincluding a photograph by Andre Serrano of a picture of Christ on across submerged in a jar of urine, and the other a show by the latephotographer Robert Mapplethorpe that included explicit photos ofhomosexual acts and a nude boy.   But Yates said two mistakes out of some 4,000 annual grants donot warrant imposing a ``lingering death'' on an agency whosesubsidies are used to foster cultural enrichment across the country.   Yates said Helms' measure ``establishes a broad and sweepingpattern of censorship. This is the start of George Orwell's bigbrother; it's the communist approach to art.''   The endowment's critics questioned whether the government shouldbe using tax dollars at all to subsidize art.   ``The question is sponsorship, not censorship,`` saidRohrabacher. ``Artists can do whatever they want on their own timeand with their own dime.''   Democrats united behind Yates, rejecting Helms' measure by amargin of 212-38. House Republicans, whose campaign committeealready has used the issue against selected incumbent Democrats,supported the ban by 116-52.   Before the vote, Democratic leaders thwarted an attempt todisplay on the House floor copies of the offending photographs. Rep.George Brown, D-Calif., who was presiding over the House at thetime, denied the request by assistant GOP Whip Robert Walker ofPennsylvania, saying the exhibit would upset the decorum of theHouse.   The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, fearing a cut in itsfunds from the endowment, in June canceled a planned show ofMapplethorpe's photos.   The second-ranking officer of the Corcoran and the organizer ofthe Mapplethorpe show, Jane Livingston, resigned Wednesday, sayingshe planned to complete a book. She said that though she was``appalled'' at the cancellation, done without consulting her, herresignation ``very well may have happened now without any of theother events.''   Yates, who chairs the House subcommittee responsible for theendowment's annual funding, tried to halt the arts fundingcontroversy two months ago by cutting its $171.4 million budget fornext year by $45,000 _ the amount of federal grants that went towardthe Mapplethorpe and Serrano exhibits.</TEXT></DOC>
