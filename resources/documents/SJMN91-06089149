Theirresponsible new master plan being proposed does nothing to address the noiseproblem.;    We heard much about the possible options to increasecommercial-air carrier operations and the great increase in revenues for SanJose. The only mention of noise was a note that the Federal AviationAdministration has mandated that all Stage 2 aircraft (older, noisier models)be phased out by 1999, eight years away and likely to be extended.;    I amnot opposed to expansion. What I am opposed to is the increased noise andpollution that expansion will bring if unchecked. There are viable solutions,such as phasing out Stage 2 aircraft by next year.;    The airport should notbe allowed to expand until these problems are addressed.;    -- Sam Miller;San Jose  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910329  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  208  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 29, 199100089149,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
