But the committee, in its $305 billion fiscal 1990 defense bill,voted to keep alive the controversial V-22 Osprey tilt-rotoraircraft, inviting Cheney to change his mind about canceling theprogram.   Committee chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,the senior Republican on the panel, said the final bill was approvedunanimously.   At a news conference, Nunn and Warner expressed strong supportfor the B-2 program. But Nunn said he had ``sticker shock'' from thehigh costs of producing the bomber.   ``If that plane doesn't fly, the debate's over,'' Nunn said.``It's far too expensive to be a stealth taxi.''   The plane designed to evade Soviet radar has yet to fly, but thefirst test could come as soon as Saturday. The plane has beenundergoing runway testing this week in Palmdale, Calif.   The committee voted to increase spending on the Strategic DefenseInitiative by $800 million next year, to $4.5 billion, which isstill $366 million below the administration request.   ``We expect to be severely challenged on the floor on that,''Nunn said.   The committee also:   _Endorsed a 3.6 percent military pay raise, along with increasesin flight pay and medical benefits.   _Earmarked additional spending for cleaning up waste atDepartment of Energy military nuclear facilities. Members approved$1.8 billion, $418 million above the administration request.Additional money would also be provided for research on new clean-uptechniques.   _Included $100 million for research on the proposed aerospaceplane which would take off and land like a regular jet but fly atgreat speeds in the upper atmosphere.   _Provided $30 million for developing lighter and better infantryweapons.   The B-2 is considered the most expensive plane in history. Withdevelopment costs added, each will cost between $500 million and$650 million, and the military intends to buy 132 over the next fewyears.   The Senate committee trimmed $300 million from theadministration's $4.7 billion request for the B-2 program next yearand included in its bill a series of testing requirements before theplane could go into full production. Then, the cost of each planemust be held to $295 million after development costs, Nunn said.   The jet, if successful, could force the Soviets to totally revamptheir air defense system at a cost far exceeding the B-2 price tag,Nunn said.   The decision to cut the F-14D was a tough one, Nunn said, addingthat he felt obligated to back Cheney in his effort to controldefense spending.   The House committee overruled both Cheney and its own chairman,voting to authorize production of the newest version of the F-14D.Warner said there was similar sentiment in the Senate panel, but``the two of us stood there like a stone wall.''   The Senate committee also approved Cheney's request to endseveral other weapons programs, including production of the F15-Efighter after fiscal 1991, the Apache helicopter after fiscal 1991,the Army Helicopter Improvement Program, the Phoenix missile, theM88 tank-recovery tow vehicle, and an SSN-688 nuclear submarine.   The exception came when the committee voted to keep alive theOsprey, which takes off like a helicopter then flies like anairplane. The Marine Corps is backing the program, but Cheneydecided to cancel it.   The committee bill would complete development of the aircraft butnot begin production. Nunn said the committee ``is hopeful'' theDefense Department would find a way to justify production of theplane.</TEXT></DOC>
