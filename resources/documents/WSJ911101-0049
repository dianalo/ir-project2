The Treasury's latest 30-year bond, the market's benchmarkissue, ended about 1/8 point lower yesterday, a loss of about$1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue'syield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price,rose to 7.91% from 7.90%.</LP><TEXT>   But while the benchmark bond declined, prices of mostintermediate and short-term notes rose. Shorter-termsecurities took heart from confirmation that the FederalReserve cut the federal funds rate to 5% Wednesday and bycomments from White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, whosaid &quot;there could be other drops to come&quot; in interest rates.The federal funds rate is the rate that banks charge eachother for overnight loans.   The Fed's latest move and the potential for further cutscreated strong demand for intermediate maturities, such asfive-year Treasurys, among money managers seeking to lock inyield, says John Hickey, chief officer for Treasury andinvestments at the New York branch of Kansallis Osake Pankki,a Finnish bank.   But there was little demand yesterday for longer-termsecurities.   Late in the day, Treasury prices declined a little furtheron reports of stronger-than-expected growth in money supply,considered a sign of economic strength.   The Federal Reserve reported that the money supply measureknown as M2 grew $9.6 billion in the latest reporting week,compared with expectations of a $4.1 billion rise.   That puts M2, the most widely watched of the moneymeasures by the Fed, just inside the central bank's targetband. M2 is growing at a 2.6% rate from a fourth quarter 1990base, just above the bottom of the Fed's 2.5% to 6.5% targetrange.   Despite the second successive strong gain in weekly M2,market participants aren't certain of a change in the trendof weak money growth.   &quot;It's important to keep it in perspective. We're stillbouncing along the bottom&quot; of the Fed's targets, says MatthewAlexy, senior analyst at Deutsche Bank Government SecuritiesInc., who notes that the Fed would already have seen themoney supply data when it apparently cut rates Wednesday.   Also released late in the session, the NationalAssociation of Purchasing Management's October index droppedto 53.5% from 55% in September. That was right at marketexpectations.   Some traders were reluctant to respond to the NAPM indexbecause it was released sooner than expected. The data hadbeen due out Friday, and the early release surprised some,Deutsche Bank's Mr. Alexy says.   Other data released in the early part of the session, suchas jobless claims, had minimal effect. Initial claims forstate unemployment insurance fell 47,000 in the latest week.Many analysts discounted the report, saying the drop was dueto seasonal factors related to the Columbus Day holiday.   The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, whichis available only to subscribers, was said to have fallen to78.3 in October from 83.0 in September.   On the economic slate for today is the October'semployment report, considered one of the most importanteconomic indicators.   Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have risen only 18,000 inOctober and the unemployment rate is forecast to be up 0.1percentage point to 6.8%, according to a consensus ofeconomists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.   Some analysts believe that the Fed may cut interest ratesagain if the employment report shows weakness. &quot;We will havea discount rate cut . . . most likely immediately followingthe employment report,&quot; says Albert Gross, chief economist atRefco Inc.   The discount rate is the rate at which the Fed lends tobanks. It stands now at 5% and Mr. Gross looks for a cut inthe rate to 4.5%.   Traders note that a cut in the discount rate is largelyfactored into bond prices already.   &quot;If we don't get a discount rate cut {Friday}, we canassume that we'll get it Tuesday&quot; when the Fed'spolicy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets inWashington, says Paul McCormack, government trading managerat Chase Securities Inc.   Also due out today is the latest report on the index ofleading economic indicators. The index is forecast to havebeen unchanged in the month, according to another Dow JonesCapital Markets Report consensus of economists.   Both the employment report and the index of leadingeconomic indicators are due to be released at 8:30 a.m. EST.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended mixed. The Treasury's benchmark 30-yearbond ended at 102 10/32 to yield 7.91% compared with 10215/32 to yield 7.90%.   The latest two-year notes were unchanged at 100 17/32 toyield 5.70%. But 10-year notes were higher at 102 24/32 toyield 7.45% compared with 102 22/32 to yield 7.46%. Rates onTresury bills were little changed.   In when-issued trading, the 30-year bond to be sold nextThursday were quoted at a yield of 7.88%. The when-issued10-year note to be sold Wednesday was quoted at 7.45% whilethe three-year notes to be sold Tuesday was quoted at 5.99%.                                                                                                          Corporates andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Junk bond prices barely moved yesterday, althoughhigh-risk, high-yield bonds of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.jumped on the success of the food and tobacco giant'spreferred stock offering.   RJR Nabisco late yesterday successfully sold 200 milliondepositary shares, priced at $10.125 each for a dividendyield of 8.247%. Each depositary share represents one-quartershare of preferred equity redemption cumulative stock.   Even though the terms of the offering weren't known untilafter the market close, junk bond traders said RJR Nabiscobonds were buoyed by rumors throughout the day that earlyefforts to place the issue had been going smoothly.   RJR Nabisco's 15% pay-in-kind debentures jumped two pointsto finish at 116 7/8. Pay-in-kind issues pay interest in theform of additional securities.   Meanwhile, in the secondary market for investment-gradecorporate debt, prices of high-grade bonds were mixed.   The recent decline in interest rates encouraged a numberof issuers to sell debt. Almost $500 million of new debt wassold yesterday with the biggest issuer of the day beingtelecommunications concern MCI Communications Corp. MCIoffered $250 million of five-year senior notes yielding7.664%.   Municipal Securities                                                                                                          Active municipals ended unchanged to 1/8 point lower inlethargic dealings.   Bucking the municipal market's downward trend,Massachusetts Water Resources Authority bonds posted gains ofas much as 3/8 point.   Late in the session, the authority's 5.75% securities of2021 were quoted at 86 1/8, up 3/8, to yield 6.83%. Asmattering of institutional buying was cited by dealers.   Strong investor demand has left few of the bonds availableto trade in the market, despite the authority's $300 millionoffering earlier this month, dealers added.   The bonds also are attractive because they are discountbonds. Discount bonds are sold at a price below their parvalue. These bonds are attractive in a rising market becausethere is more room for appreciation before the bonds reachtheir par value.   In limited new issue dealings yesterday, an unsold balanceof about $10 million was reported late in the session onRochester, N.Y.'s offering of $80.24 million of various bondanticipation notes.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities prices ended higher.   Among secondary issues, Government National MortgageAssociation 8% securities for November delivery were up 4/32at 99 12/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 8%securities were 3/32 firmer at 99 2/32 and Federal NationalMortgage Association 8% securities were up 3/32 at 98 29/32.   In the asset-backed market, Citibank's $1.69 billionglobal credit-card securities offering was priced generallyin line with expectations and was reportedly received warmlyby investors. Citibank is a unit of Citicorp.   Demand was strong enough to prompt underwriters led byFirst Boston Corp. to boost the size from the original $1.405billion.   The $650 million of senior two-year securities were pricedto yield 6.322%, while the $850 million of senior seven-yearsecurities yielded 7.961%. Yield spreads above Treasurys were0.63 percentage point and 0.825 percentage point,respectively.   The $80.5 million subordinated two-year securities yielded6.689%, a percentage point above Treasurys, and $105.5million subordinated seven-year securities yielded 8.436%.   All but the subordinated seven-year securities were pricedin line with expectations. The 1.30 percentage point yieldspread on these seven-year securities was wider than theexpected 1.20 to 1.25 percentage point range.</TEXT></DOC>
