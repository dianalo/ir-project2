The opposition condemned the move, and for the first time innine years more Japanese said they supported the opposition partiesthan the governing Liberal Democratic Party, according to anewspaper poll.   In 35 years of unbroken rule, the Liberal Democrats had nevercompletely ignored the opposition in voting on the budget, eventhough they hold an overwhelming majority in Parliament.   The $455 billion budget was subject to only two days of publicdebate in February. According to the constitution, the budget nowgoes to the upper house for approval, but it will be implemented onMay 27 if that assembly fails to pass it.   The opposition had stalled budget deliberations since Februaryby boycotting parliamentary sessions to press their demand thatformer Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone testify about his links toRecruit Co., a business and publishing conglomerate at the centerof the bribery and stock-profiteering scandal.   The government has been operating on an interim budget sinceApril 1. With the government unable to issue bonds or authorize newpublic works projects, analysts said business confidence was indanger of falling. This may have helped prompt the move by theLiberal Democratic Party, which has close ties with big business,analysts said.   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita announced he wouldresign after the budget is approved to take responsibility for theRecruit scandal, which has brought sharp public criticism of hisadministration and his party.   Japanese political tradition holds that the governing partyshould provide an opportunity for opposition parties to participatein parliamentary debate and vote even if they comprise only aminority.   Opposition politicians blocked a hallway leading to the lowerhouse in an attempt to prevent the vote on the budget, but guardspushed them aside to get Speaker Kenzaburo Hara into the 512-seatchamber.   One independent lawmaker voted against the budget, which passedby a 281-1 margin.   The party's budget action was ``an outrage unprecedented sincethe end of World War II ... and a serious challenge to thepeople,'' said Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party,the largest opposition group.   The deputy speaker of the house, a former Socialist, said hewould resign his post, while an upper house lawmaker from a minoropposition party said he would quit Parliament to protest thegoverning party's move. Four Liberal Democrats also boycotted thevote in protest against their party's action, while 11 members wereabsent.   In a survey conducted by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, 44 percentof 2,403 respondents said they supported one of Japan's five mainopposition parties or other minor parties, while 42 percent saidthey supported the Liberal Democrats. The poll was takenimmediately after Takeshita announced his plans to resign and wasto appear in the newspaper's Saturday editions.   An Asahi editorial Saturday called for the dissolution ofParliament for new elections and a ``radical reform of politics inour country.''   Takeshita is to leave Saturday for a week-long trip to SoutheastAsia and is expected to step down after his return.   News reports continued to speculate on who would be hissuccessor, with many analysts expecting that former ForeignMinister Masayoshi Ito, 75, would eventually accept the postalthough he has so far refused suggestions that he take the job.   In the scandal, Recruit sold unlisted stocks at low prices toabout 160 prominent people, including politicians and businessmen.Many of the recipients sold their shares after they were listedpublicly and rose sharply in value.   Takeshita has admitted receiving more than $1 million inpolitical donations from Recruit in 1985-87.   Before attending the budget session, Takeshita attended thefuneral of Ihei Aoki, his top aide and fund controller, whocommitted suicide Wednesday.   Aoki had purchased Recruit shares and used the profits tofinance Takeshita's political expenses. The prime minister'sannouncement Tuesday that he would resign apparently prompted Aokito hang himself.</TEXT></DOC>
