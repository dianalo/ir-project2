A nation doesn't buildsubmarines, nuclear missiles, tanks and helicopters if it's really broke.Money doesn't matter to the Soviets -- to them it's just paper. Rather, whatmatters is their forward base, Cuba! Communism, we now remember, isexpansionist.;   Communist tyranny can never really exist in harmony with freenations. Freedom actually works in Germany, France, England, and so on. Andthose examples are just too close to the Soviet borders for the Red Army, theKGB, or the rejuvenated Communist Party to take lying down.;   Let's hope theaverage Russian can, just for once, stop the Army of World Revolution in itstracks! Let's hope the apparatchiks fall flat on their faces. Pray.;   -- MarkJ. Johnson; Redwood City; CUSTOMS OFFICERS WERE RUDE, RACIST; A few weeks agoI returned to the United States at San Francisco airport, only to experienceobnoxious and racist behavior by customs officers.;   Some passengers weredirected to a special customs line, the only one with an X-ray scanner. Inline for some 45 minutes, I noted that only one person in that line was white.Most were Orientals, many elderly, with a mix of U.S. and foreign citizens.;  The X-ray scanner, like those used to scan hand baggage at airports, had aconveyer belt about 3 feet off the ground. A customs officer stood by thisbelt, snapping at people to lift their bags onto the machine. Many passengerswere hard put to get the bags up, but the customs officer was impatient, rude,unhelpful and forbade others to help.;   After going through the scanner, somebags were hand-inspected. The inspecting officers exchanged racist jokes aboutOriental people, wondered aloud why people came if they couldn't speak thelanguage, and exchanged tales about the &quot;weird&quot; things that Chinese andJapanese ate. Impatient with passengers who couldn't follow an Americanaccent, the officers shouted at them (communication by intimidation?).;   Igathered that some passengers had food in their possession. U.S. Customsprovides few instructions on what food is allowed in; any food may beconfiscated at the discretion of the customs officer on the spot.;   Why can'tU.S. Customs: 1) be polite, 2) provide a scanner that doesn't require you tobe a weight-lifter, 3) make explicit rules about foods that are not allowed in(presumably business importers have this figured out), and 4) provide theirofficers basic training in manners and in other cultures and foods?;   --Shripad Tuljapurkar; Mountain View; Distracted drivers; are the real hazard; Iread with interest your article concerning the danger of car phones (Living,Aug. 15). While I am not a car phone owner (I can't afford one!), I am writingin defense of them.;   As the article pointed out, these &quot;toys&quot; can literallybe a life-saving tool. And while I agree that pulling to the side of the roadto make or receive calls is certainly the solution to the problem of unfocuseddriving, I would like to point out that car phone owners are not the onlydrivers concentrating on matters not pertaining to good driving.;   I am amother of two children, and I have seen many of my peers with two, three, fouror more kids in the car or van. If you think a business deal is distracting onthe road, try breaking up a fist fight, searching for a fallen pacifier orholding a bottle in a baby's mouth -- all the while remaining alert to roadsafety. Furthermore, I have seen drivers reading maps, engaging in heatedarguments with passengers, kissing, putting on make-up, flirting withoccupants of neighboring vehicles, eating a messy sandwich, etc., whileattempting to maneuver a vehicle in traffic.;   Let's give the car phone folksa break and ask all drivers to pull over when they are involved in activitiesthat take their minds off the task at hand, ensuring greater safety foreveryone on the road.;   -- Brenda L.
