DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court has rejected Democraticpresidential candidate Michael Dukakis' attempt to use his power asgovernor to block a Massachusetts National Guard training mission inCentral America.   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-sentence orderTuesday affirming a May 6 decision by U.S. District Judge RobertKeeton, who upheld federal supremacy over the National Guard.   ``Having examined the briefs of the parties ... and having hadthe benefit of oral argument, we affirm the judgment on the basisstated in the district court's well-reasoned opinion,'' the appealscourt said.   Dukakis sued in January to block the assignment of 13 publicrelations specialists in the Massachusetts Guard to Honduras andPanama for two weeks in May because of his opposition to Reaganadministration policies in the region.   In his presidential campaign, Dukakis has denounced theadministration for its ``failed and illegal'' policy of supportingNicaraguan rebels, and he said sending Guard troops to the regionwas an attempt to intimidate Nicaragua.   Dukakis, who was campaigning Tuesday in California and Colorado,had no immediate comment on the appellate decision. A press aide,Steven Crawford, said the governor was disappointed that the courtchose not to uphold the ``important principle'' of state authority.   State Attorney General James Shannon, who represented Dukakis incourt, said he would wait until another federal appeals court rulesin a similar challenge before deciding whether to appeal to the U.S.Supreme Court.   John Bolton, chief of the civil division in the U.S. JusticeDepartment, said he was pleased by the ruling: ``It represents thecomplete vindication of the administration's position.''   After Keeton issued his ruling in May, Dukakis appealed but didnot try to stop the Massachusetts troops from participating in theexercises, which involved road-building.   In his decision, Keeton explicitly upheld the constitutionalityof the Montgomery Amendment, a 1986 act of Congress that saysgovernors may not decline such assignments ``because of anyobjection to the location, purpose, type or schedule of suchactivity.''   ``At issue in this case is the constitutional status of themodern National Guard,'' Keeton wrote, framing his question in termsof competing clauses in the U.S. Constitution that divided controlover the new nation's militia between the federal government and thestates.   Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department argued that the ``ArmyClause'' in the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate say overthe nation's entire military apparatus. They described Dukakis'position as ``a dagger aimed at the heart of national defense.''   The Massachusetts' attorney general's office, representingDukakis, had claimed that the ``Militia Clause'' reserved power tothe governors over training the militia.   Assistant Attorney General Douglas Wilkins stressed the``original intent'' of the Constitution's framers, arguing thatstate control over the ``militia'' was essentially undisturbed bythe many reorganizations of the nation's military.   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, joined by Massachusetts and nineother states, challenged the law last year in U.S. District Court inSt. Paul and lost. The case is now on appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
