The series comprised 60 patients withTIA, who underwent the two procedures with a mean interval of 16 days.Conventional angiography was generally superior to IV-DSA, and this wasparticularly marked in the siphons and cerebral arteries. Only the excellentIV-DSA examinations obtained in a few patients with TIA could be acceptedas final pre-operative procedures. Accurate imaging of the lesions andcollateral flow pattern usually required intra-arterial injections, andintra-arterial DSA is now usually preferred.</TEXT></DOC>
