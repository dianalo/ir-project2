Morethan 300 people have been killed.   The strife comes at a time when Indian politicians, lackingclear-cut ideologies, are defining their vote blocs by religion.   Police with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled five northern Indiantowns Saturday after renewed Hindu-Moslem clashes claimed 13 morelives, the Press Trust of India said. Police also said more victimswere discovered from clashes Friday, bringing the overall deathtotal to at least 305.   The issue has shaken Prime Minister V.P. Singh's centristgovernment, which gained power 11 months ago. It is in troublebecause it lost the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party, aright-wing Hindu group. Singh faces a confidence vote Wednesday.   Singh might soon be deposed or relegated to a caretaker role,which would leave India limping toward new elections four yearsahead of schedule.   Both the riots and government crisis were precipitated by theefforts of Hindu fundamentalists to build a temple where theybelieve the god Rama was born, which happens to be under theAyodhya mosque. The Bharatiya Janata fervently espoused the templeproject.   Emboldened by its make-or-break position in the government, theparty claims to speak for India's Hindu majority.   Its rhetoric, however, often resembles that of an embattledminority - especially after Singh, a Hindu, tried to halt thetemple project while the courts sorted out conflicting Hindu-Moslemclaims to the site.   Moslemsare only 12 percent of India's 880 million people andtend to keep a low profile, especially when it comes toconfrontation with the Hindu majority of 82 percent. Despite this,they went to court in an effort to save the 460-year-old Ayodhyamosque, fearing that if it went, others would follow.   The Moslem suit provoked a tempestuous reaction.   ``They want to swallow the whole of India,'' said Vijay KumarMalhotra, secretary of the Bharatiya Janata and a parliamentarian.``They have the government siding with them. The Indian homeminister is a Moslem. In India, to be a Hindu has become a crime.''   A year ago, Indians were anxious for change and weary ofallegations of corruption against Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Theysplintered their vote; nobody won, everyone lost.   Gandhi's Congress Party got 37 percent of the 522 Parliamentseats, Singh's National Front coalition got 27 percent and theBharatiya Janata bounced from near-obscurity to 17 percent. Singhteamed with the Bharatiya Janata and the Communists to forge amajority.   There was little discernible difference in the platforms ofdemocratic socialism presented by the Congress Party and NationalFront, and the Communists stood only slightly to the left.   Even the Bharatiya Janata's written manifesto was similar tothose of the Congress and the National Front, but its oratoryappealed to a nationalism that increasingly tended toward Hindufundamentalism.   Because Singh's coalition was considered shaky from the start,everyone started anticipating new elections and staking outconstituencies.   The Moslems minority can be pivotal in close elections. TheCongress Party and National Front compete for the Moslem vote andneed to win Hindus back from the Bharatiya Janata.   ``More and more riots are becoming political statements,'' saidAshis Nandy, a political analyst with the Center for the Study ofDeveloping Societies, an independent think tank.   Many analysts say religious blocs have become more important inthe absence of ideological constituencies. Almost any issue, suchas Ayodhya, that entices or placates one group alienates orthreatens another.   ``Religion is being used as a political tool,'' said Rev. ArokiaDoss, a Jesuit theologian who studies the interaction of India'sdifferent faiths.   M.J. Akbar, Congress Party spokesman, singled out the BharatiyaJanata Party for blame in the Ayodhya violence, but added:   ``You can get freedom by winning a war of independence. A nationcan be formed by a revolution, but the state only stabilizes afterits civil war.''   Akbar, a Moslem who has written extensively on India's internalfrictions, would not characterize India's current situation ascivil war, but ``a process of confrontation in order to achievepolitical power.''   Although riots and rebellions are frequent in India, it also hasa rich history of nonviolent protest and religious tolerance.   It broke free of British colonial rule in 1947 through peacefulprotests and strikes led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, revered as theMahatma, or ``Great Soul.''   On the verge of that independence, however, it broke apart onreligious lines and was partitioned into India, predominatelyHindu, and Pakistan, overwhelmingly Moslem.   There was a bloody transmigration in which 1 million peopledied, but nearly as many Moslems remain in India as now live inPakistan.   Memories of those violent days continue to stir Hindu-Moslemantagonism, but Nandy found one legacy of hope.   ``Even after a million killed, we could go back to a normallife,'' he said. ``It left its scars, but one could go back tocivilized living. But that's the optimistic view.''   The pessimistic view?   ``Each party will continue to play its own games.''</TEXT></DOC>
