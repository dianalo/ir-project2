The Conference Board, an industry-supported, non-profit economic research concern, said its help-wanted advertising index for November fell to 160, down from October's 163, but 17 points above the year-ago reading of 143.    The index, which uses 1967 as a base of 100, measures the volume of classified advertising in 51 major newspapers. Kenneth Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said while November's decline may represent &quot;only a pause in a long-running upward trend, there is reason to believe that this trend in labor demand came to a halt following the October stock market crash.&quot; He said a rise in unemployment seems likely, with some forecasts projecting a 6.5% unemployment rate a year from now.    Advertising volume rose slightly in five of the nine regions of the country, while four fell. Both the South Atlantic area, which includes Washington, D.C., Atlanta and Miami, and the Pacific area, with Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, showed steep declines from the month before. </TEXT></DOC>
