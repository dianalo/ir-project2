Japan had offered to remove quotas on all but two of 10 categories of agricultural products that a dispute-settlement panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had ruled violated international trade rules. Yesterday, when other GATT members backed the U.S. position that Tokyo should dismantle the quotas on all 10 product categories, Japan blocked the adoption of the panel's report, claiming that it needs more time to consider its options.    That brought a threat from the Reagan administration to retaliate if Japan continues to impede the GATT action. In a statement, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter warned that the U.S. would &quot;pursue its legitimate interests through other means&quot; if Japan doesn't &quot;live up to its GATT responsibilities.&quot;    Depending on what Tokyo does next, the dispute could be quietly resolved through a series of established trade procedures, or it could escalate to punitive U.S. actions such as additional tariffs on certain Japanese products.    Tokyo has acknowledged that it faces sharp domestic opposition to liberalizing trade in the two problem categories. One is powdered skim milk, a product on which farmers on the northern island of Hokkaido are heavily dependent. The other is starch, which provides for the livelihoods of numerous sweet-potato farmers on southern Kyushu, another Japanese island.    Some U.S. officials speculated that Japan could just be dragging out the process until it can settle somehow with the aggrieved Japanese farmers.    However, another alternative for Japan would be to accept the GATT finding without reservations but to remove quotas only on the product groups it previously proposed to liberalize. Under GATT procedures, that would leave the U.S. entitled to demand compensation, such as reduced tariffs on other products. But that might be a more bearable cost for Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party than losing farm votes on which it usually depends.    A similar dispute over Japanese import quotas on leather goods was resolved in such a way last year. Japan wouldn't eliminate the quotas completely as the U.S. demanded, but it offered lower tariffs on a number of U.S. products in compensation.    A Japanese diplomat said he couldn't predict his governmnent's choice. &quot;It's a very political issue,&quot; he acknowledged.    GATT is a United Nations-sponsored body that sets and enforces rules for international trade. Yesterday, Mr. Yeutter stood on principle to justify his rejection of anything less than full Japanese compliance with the GATT panel's ruling. &quot;If Japan is permitted to block the report, it will deal a very serious blow to this mechanism, damaging the very international trading system that has made its prosperity possible,&quot; he said.    At the same time, the House reasserted its pique over Japan's trade behavior by voting 399-17 to effectively ban Japanese construction companies from U.S. government-financed construction projects if Japan doesn't extend equivalent privileges to U.S. concerns. The Reagan administration could waive the ban, however. The provision, introduced by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, was incorporated into the omnibus House spending bill for fiscal 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
