Introduction</ITAG> On June 2, 1989, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'')filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''),pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),\1\<NOTE/> and rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> a proposed rule change to trade ``Exchange Stock Portfolios''(``ESP's''), standardized baskets of stocks, on the floor of the exchange.The proposed rule change consists of changes to existing Exchange rules,the adoption of a new ``800 series'' of rules that apply solely to ESPtrading, the adoption of guidelines to implement certain provisions ofthe proposed rules, and an ESP fee schedule. Amendments No. 1, 2, and 3,submitted on September 1 and 13 and October 18, 1989, respectively, proposedadditional changes to the Exchange's rules, fees and the statements ofpurposes governing the proposed rule change.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C 78s(b)(1) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1989). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In Amendment No. 2, The NYSE proposed, among other things,that the Commission initially approve proposed NYSE Rules 805 and 806 foronly a 6-month period. In amendments No. 2 and 3, the exchange requestedaccelerated approval of file No. SR-NYSE-89-05, as amended. Notice of the proposed rule change was provided by the issuance of a Commissionrelease (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26908, June 8, 1989), andby publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 25516, June 15, 1989). Nine comment letterswere received regarding the proposed rule change.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/> \4\ <T3>See</T3> notes 59-71,<T3> infra</T3> and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of the Proposal</ITAG> A. ESP Description. The ESP service enables the trading of standardized baskets of stocksat an aggregate price in a single execution on the Exchange's stock Floor.\5\<NOTE/> An ESP trade will result in a transfer to the buyer of ownershipof each of the component stocks. When the transaction is completed, thebuyer will be entitled to all rights attending ownership of the basketstocks (including rights to vote and receive dividends), and will be freeto sell or hold each stock separately.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ NYSE Rule 800(b)(iii) defines the term ``basket'' as ``agroup of stocks that the Exchange designates as eligible for executionin a single trade through the ESP service and that consists of stocks whoseinclusion and relative representation in the group are determined by theinclusion and relative representation of their current market prices inawidely-disseminated stock index reflecting the stock market as a whole.''<T3> See also</T3> the definition contained in proposed Rule 431(a)(8).NYSE Rule 801: (1) Limits ESP trading to baskets that the Exchange hasapproved; (2) authorizes the Exchange to change the component stocks comprisinga basket; and (3) requires that a basket's component stocks have been admittedto dealings for ESP purposes on an ``issued'', ``when issued'', or ``whendistributed'' basis. <T3>See also</T3> NYSE Rule 804. That same buyer may later sell the basket stocks he acquired, either individuallyor through another ESP trade. In order to sell the basket stocks throughthe ESP service, they must be identical as a group with the standardizedESP basket at the time of sale. If a buyer has sold individual basket stocksand has not separately re-acquired them, or if changes have been made tothe index sincethe basket was purchased, the buyer will havew to ``rebalance''his position by purchasing or borrowing the additional securities so thathe can deliver all the current ESP stocks in their proportionate numberof shares. Initially, ESP trading will be available for executions of a standardizedbasket of 500 stocks comprising the ``Standard andamp; Poor's (``Sandamp;P'')500 (``Sandamp;P 500'') Portfolio Index.''\6\<NOTE/> At the commencement of ESP trading, each 500-stock ESP willhave a value of approximately $5 million.\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Section 12(a) of the act generally prohibits the tradingof a security on a national securities exchange unless the security isrequested on the exchange. Upon application by an exchange and Commissionapproval, however, section 129(f)(1) of the Act and Rule 12f-1 thereunderauthorize the Commission to extend unlisted trading privileges (``UTP'')to any security registered pursuant to Sections 12(b) or (g) of the Act.The NYSE's Sandamp;P 500 Portfolio Index currently is comprised of 39 stocksthat are not listed for trading on the NYSE. Pursuant to Section 12(f)of the Act, the Exchange has submitted applications for UTP in 206 stocksfor the limited purpose of ESP stock basket trading based upon the Sandamp;P500 Portfolio Index, which the Commission has approved by separate order.Because the composition of the market baskets will change from time totime as the composition of the Sandamp;P 500 Index changes, it will be necessaryfor the NYSE to request UTP in additional securities in the future. Section12(f)(5) of the Act requires that 10 days' notice be provided to the issuerof a security for which UTP has been requested. This requirement couldhamper trading in standardized market baskets, as the NYSE cannot receive10 days advance notice of changes in the Sandamp;P 500 Index.To remedy this,the Commission is considering a new rule [Rule 12a-7] that will exemptfrom section 12(a), solely for the purpose of market basket trading, securitiesincluded in a standardized market basket product approved by the Commissionpursuant to section 19(b) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/> \7\ The dollar value of a basket bid or offer is determinedby multiplying the basket multiplier and the number of index points bidor offered. NYSE Rule 801.10. Pursuant to NYSE Rule 800(b)(v), the term``basket multiplier'' is defined as an amount which, when multiplied bythe current price of a basket expressed in index points, establishes thedollar value of the basket. Subject to compliance with Rule 19b-4 underthe Act, the Exchange shall from time to time specify each basket's multiplier.The Exchange will issue specifications setting forth the number of sharesof each of a basket's component stocks that comprise a basket based upona formula that determines the percentage of the total index that each componentstock represents. NYSE Rule 801.10. The Sandamp;P 500 Portfolio Index is nearly identical to the Sandamp;P 500Index, containing the same stocks and with virtually the same capitalizationweighting. It differs in two respects to accommodate standardized baskettrading. First, the Sandamp;P 500 Portfolio Index is designed so that fractionalshare interests that would result from a basket derived directly from theSandamp;P 500 Index are rounded up or down to the nearest whole share. Becauseof this factor, a basket based on the Sandamp;P 500 Portfolio Index willnot contain fractional shares.Second, in order to decrease the occasions when rebalancing is necessaryto liquidate a basket position, the Exchange may not adjust the Sandamp;P500 Portfolio Index every time Sandamp;P adjusts the Sandamp;P 500 Index. Ata minimum, the Exchange will adjust the Sandamp;P 500 Portfolio Index eachcalendar quarter. The Exchange will determine when additional adjustmentswill be made to the Sandamp;P 500 Portfolio Index in response to adjustmentsmade to the Sandamp;P 500 Index. Generally, such additional adjustments willbe made whenever an index stock is substituted or some other corporateevent occurs that affects significantly an index stock's relative capitalizationin the Sandamp;P 500 Index, such as the issuance of stock dividends or specialcash distributions. Whenever an adjustment is made to the Sandamp;P 500 PortfolioIndex, all intervening changes to the Sandamp;P 500 Index will be incorporatedas well.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The NYSE states that index information will be readilyavailable to investors. The Exchange will use Sandamp;P's Index Alert Systemto disseminate current information about the composition and capitalizationweighting of the Sandamp;P 500 Portfolio Index. In addition, the Exchangewill maintain in files available to the public current data on the compositionof the component stocks and their relative representation in the Indexand the method of calculating the Index. The Exchange also will make availablecomputer disks containing all current data on the state of the Index aswell as a facility for disseminating current data on the component stocksthrough commercial electronic mail.The NYSE states that even with these two differences, the Sandamp;P 500 PortfolioIndex closely tracks the Sandamp;P 500 Index. During the latter half of 1988,the ``tracking'' error between the two indexes never exceeded .02 indexpoints.Under andSection; 220.18(a) of Regulation T,\9\<NOTE/> ESP trades would be subject to the 50% initial margin requirementapplicable to exchange-traded equity securities. In addition, basket stocksthat are acquired through an ESP transaction would be subject to the 25%maintenance margin requirement set out in NYSE Rule 431(c)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 12 CFR 220.18(a) (1989).B. ESP Market Structure.1. <T3>Competitive Basket Market Makers.</T3>_The Exchange will not use itsstandard specialist system to trade ESPs, but instead will employ a marketstructure consisting of ``Competitive Basket Market Makers'' (``CBMMs''),Exchange specialists, Floor brokers, and an ESP ``Basket Book Broker''(``BBB''). The CBMMs will perform the principal market-making functionfor ESP trading,\10\<NOTE/> and registration as a CBMM will trigger specific market-makingobligations. In contrast to the traditional exchange specialist, CBMMswill not be required to maintain a presence on the Floor. They may fulfilltheir market-making functions through their upstairs ESP terminals, whichwill provide them with the same basket data available to the crowd on theFloor, plus order-entry capability and identification of their own enteredorders. Under proposed NYSE Rule 36.20, CBMMs (or CBMM nominees) on theFloor also will have telephone access to their upstairs desks.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ In addition to the CBMMs' principal market-making functionfor ESP trading, specialists and the BBB perform a secondary, passive ESPmarket-making function. <T3>See</T3> notes 17-32, <T3>infra</T3> and accompanying text.Pursuant to NYSE Rule 807A(a), a NYSE member or member organization mayregister as a CBMM by satisfying such registration requirements as theExchange may from time to time specify. Registered CBMMs must meet a minimum$10 million capital requirement over and above any and all other federaland/or Exchange capital requirements.\11\<NOTE/> Exchange members or member organizations registered as CBMMsin the ESP market basket would be treated as specialists for margin purposes,and would be entitled to good faith margin treatment for ESP transactionseffected in their CBMM accounts.\12\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ NYSE Rule 807A(d). <T3>See also,</T3> Rule 15c3-1 under the Act, 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 (1989);NYSE Rule 325.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Under proposed NYSE Rule 431(e)(2)(D), a member organizationmay clear and carry a CBMM's ESP trades upon such margin as the memberand market maker may agree so long as the resulting margin adequately coversthe risk attendant to the Market Functions Account (<T3>i.e.,</T3> CBMM account) in which the ESP transactions are carried.Moreover, NYSE Rule 807A(g) authorizes a CBMM to have a bank or a memberfinance its ESP transactions in a special or joint account on a marginbasis that is mutually agreeable with the carrying organization.NYSE Rule 807A(e) authorizes CBMMs to withdraw voluntarily their CBMM registrationwith proper notice to the Exchange. The NYSE Guidelines for the 800 SeriesRules_Basket Trading (``Basket Guidelines'') establish a 30 day writtennotice requirement for withdrawal of a CBMM registration. A CBMM, however,may not give such notice prior to the 60th day after its registration becomeseffective, and hence must remain registered as a CBMM until at least the90th day following the effective date of its registration. A member ormember organization so withdrawing its CBMM registration will not be eligibleto re-register as a CBMM for 30 days after such withdrawal. Moreover, aCBMM may petition the Exchange's Department of Market Surveillance in writingto suspend its CBMM market-making obligations, but only for cause.In return for the CBMM franchise, member firms undertake certain affirmativemarket-making obligations set forth in NYSE Rule 807B. The following specificobligations govern CBMM market-making activities: (1) A CBMM may make aproprietary bid or offer only in a manner consistent with the maintenanceof a fair and orderly market; (2) a CBMM must help alleviate temporarydisparities between supply and demand; (3) a CBMM must effect proprietarytrades in a reasonable and orderly manner in relation to the market ingeneral and to the basket market; and (4) a CBMM must maintain a continuous,two-sided quotation in the basket subject to a specified bid-ask parameter.13<NOTE/> The rule authorizes a CBMM to comply with its market-makingobligations by having a Floor broker represent and execute orders on itsbehalf.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>13 In addition, NYSE Rule 803 imposes on CBMMs obligationscomparable to those that Rule 11Ac1-1 under the Act, 17 CFR 240.11Ac1-1(the firm quote rule) and NYSE Rule 60 impose with respect to quotationsfor individual stocks. Basket quotations always will be firm under Rule803, except when the basket market is in the call mode. <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 816.The Basket Guidelines include a general requirement that a CBMM must maintaina spread of not greater than two index points during normal market conditionsas the bid-ask parameter. Nevertheless, whenever the spread in the Sandamp;P500 Index quote 14<NOTE/> exceeds two points, the required bid-ask spread can equalthat spread.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>14 The Sandamp;P 500 Index quotation reflects the mathematicalaggregation of all the bid and offer quotations of the component stocksmultiplied by their respective percentage weighting.Although CBMMs, like Floor brokers and BBBs, can represent customer orders,as a general matter, NYSE Rule 809 establishes that only CBMMs can initiatebasket trades for their own accounts on the Floor or from terminals.15<NOTE/> Thus, only CBMMs can facilitate a customer's ESP transaction.16<NOTE/> In addition, proposed NYSE Rule 111(g) authorizes a CBMMto initiate proprietary trades to liquidate a position in a component stockthat the CBMM established through basket transactions in the same tradingsession, whether acquired to accommodate customers, to meet his market-makingobligations, or otherwise.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>15 Pursuant to NYSE Rule 809, a non-CBMM member may initiateproprietary basket trades on the Floor to offset a basket transaction madein error or, subject to NYSE Rule 92, a non-CBMM member on the Floor mayaccept proprietary basket orders initiated off the Floor.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>16 <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 806.2. <T3>Specialists.</T3> NYSE specialists in the individual stocks comprisingthe ESP basket will, in the aggregate, act as one passive ESP market maker.Whenever all of the basket's component stocks listed on the Exchange areopen for trading, NYSE Rule 803(e) requires that the Exchange automaticallycalculate and disseminate through the ESP system at 15-second intervalsthe aggregate Tier 1 and Tier 2 quotations in all basket stocks.17<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>17 <T3>See</T3> proposed NYSE Rule 104.11A. NYSE Rule 803(e) permits specialistparticipation in the basket market through aggregate Tier 1 and Tier 2quotes only when all the NYSE-listed stocks that comprise the Sandamp;P 500Portfolio Index are open. Thus, no component stock specialist participatesin the basket market unless all participate.A specialists's ``Tier 1 component stock'' quotation means the price ofthe best published bid and published offer for a basket's component stockthat is listed on the Exchange.18<NOTE/> An ``aggregate Tier 1'' quotation will be derived from theweighted summation of the prevailing bids and offers for each of the basket'scomponent stocks as disseminated through the consolidated quotation system,plus the Tier 1 ``mini-basket'' bid and offer for the non-NYSE componentstocks.19<NOTE/> When a basket order is executed at the aggregate Tier 1 quote,upon receiving the basket execution notice through the ESP service, a specialistmust assign, take, or supply the number of shares of the component stockat the execution price needed to complete one basket and must report thesize and price as a trade to the consolidated tape.20<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>18 <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 800(b)(xi). The terms ``published bid'' and ``publishedoffer'' have the meaning given to them in Rule 11Ac1-1 under the Act, 17CFR 240.11Ac1-1. <T3>See also</T3> proposed NYSE Rule 104.11A.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>19 <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 803(e). <T3>See also</T3> notes 28-32, <T3>infra</T3> and accompanying text for a description of the BBB's obligationto supply the Tier 1 and Tier 2 ``mini-basket'' quotations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>20 <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rules 800(b)(iv), 800(b)(xi), and proposed NYSE Rule104A.11A.NYSE Rule 800(b)(xii) defines a ``Tier 2 component stock'' quotation asa bid or offer for the number of shares of a basket's component stock necessaryto comprise three baskets. NYSE Rule 803(e) specifies that the ``aggregateTier 2'' quotation derives from the weighted summation of the prevailingbids and offers for each of the component stocks necessary to fill threebaskets, plus the Tier 2 ``mini-basket'' bid and offer for the non-NYSEcomponent stocks.21<NOTE/> The aggregate Tier 2 quote represents a bid or offer forthree baskets, and is designed to operate as a limit off-market, away fromthe Tier 1 quote. The Basket Guidelines specify that the quotes for thecomponent stocks comprising the Tier 2 aggregate quotation may each be``auto-quoted'' at, or \1/8\ or \1/4\ point away from, the Tier 1 individualquote.22<NOTE/> If a basket order is executed at the aggregate Tier 2 quote,each component stock specialist must assign, take, or supply at the executionprice the number of shares of his specialty stock needed to complete threebaskets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>21 <T3>See</T3> note 30, <T3>infra</T3> and accompanying test, for a definition of ``mini-basket''quotations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>22 The Basket Guidelines provide that the Exchange's Departmentof Market Surveillance may grant requests for wider settings consistentwith applicable Exchange Depth Guidelines.When the ESP system sends a basket execution notice to the component stockspecialist indicating that a basket order has been executed at the aggregateTier 1 or Tier 2 quotation, the specialist must assign the execution atthe execution price to interest on his book or in the trading crowd inaccordance with existing stock rules of priority and precedence,\2\\3\<NOTE/> as well as report the price to the consolidated tape.\2\\4\<NOTE/> Because the ESP system will calculate and disseminate theaggregate Tier 1 and Tier 2 quotes only once every 15 seconds, and becauseof the human and system time involved in entering an ESP trade and disseminatingthe execution notices, the Tier 1 or Tier 2 execution price indicated ina basket execution notice may be superior or inferior to the prevailingmarket quotation at the time the specialist receives the execution notice.Nevertheless, the execution price indicated in the execution notice alwayswill apply. If the execution price indicated in the notice is inferiorto the prevailing market price, the specialist must assign the executionto the bid or offer then having priority at the price indicated in thenotice. If the execution price indicated in the notice is superior, thespecialist must take or supply the necessary shares. The specialist alsois required to take or supply the necessary shares when the size of theinterest on the book or in the trading crowd at or better than the executionprice is insufficient or, in a non-firm market, when it is impracticalfor him to assign the execution to the book or trading crowd.\2\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rules 71 and 72.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ <T3>See</T3> proposed NYSE Rule 104.11A.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ <T3>Id.</T3>3. <T3>The Basket Book Broker.</T3> Under NYSE Rule 808, the BBB presidesover all ESP executions, executes orders entrusted to him, maintains theESP display unit, arranges the opening of the ESP market, presides overthe ESP call market, maintains a market in mini-baskets, reports ESP tradesto market data vendors, and otherwise generally supervises the ESP market.Qualified members or member organizations may register as a BBB,\2\\6\<NOTE/> and the BBB franchise may be operated on a rotational basis.\2\\7\<NOTE/> Each BBB must arrange to have a member qualified to act asa BBB in attendance during all business hours.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ The BBB may be affiliated with a CBMM, but the twounits must be separated in accordance with the guidelines of NYSE Rule98. <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 808(h).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ A BBB may withdraw its registration by providing theExchange's Department of Market Surveillance with 30 days' written notice.NYSE Rule 808(g).The ESP display unit is maintained by the BBB. The display unit on theFloor provides members in the trading crowd ESP market data that is alsoavailable off-Floor through vendors (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the ESP last sale price and current best quote, with sizes),as well as the size interest at each minimum tick away from the prevailingbid and offer for the basket. Thus, the display unit allows the tradingcrowd to see both the ESP bid-offer spread and the depth of the ESP market.Only the BBB's terminal has both execution and confirmation capabilities.All basket executions must be entered into the system by the BBB, and onlythe BBB's data display identifies the entering member firms. The BBB usesa terminal to perform its order entry function. CBMMs also may enter ordersthrough their upstairs terminals. CBMMs and brokers in the crowd also mayenter orders in terminals near the trading location. If the CBMM or brokerorder would result in an execution, then the BBB would enter the executioninto the system.The BBB has responsibility for the ESP limit order ``book.'' NYSE Rule808(f) requires a BBB to execute promptly any immediately-executable limitorders entrusted to him at the price shown on the display unit, in accordancewith price and time priority, against the prevailing contra-side interestuntil the order is filled, and to place promptly any other limit orderson the basket display unit.In conjunction with specialist participation for purposes of Tier 1 andTier 2 basket executions, the BBB acts also as a passive market maker withrespect to those stocks that are not NYSE-listed.\2\\8\<NOTE/> The BBB makes a market in the ``mini-basket'' \2\\9\<NOTE/> by disseminating ``Tier 1 mini-basket'' quotations and ``Tier2 mini-basket'' quotations, <T3>i.e.</T3>, ``bids and offers for the mini-basket that are related tothe markets for the stocks included in the mini-basket in accordance withsuch parameters as the Exchange may from time to time prescribe.'' \3\\0\<NOTE/> The Basket Guidelines provide that the BBB must establishTier 1 and Tier 2 quotes expressed in \1/8\ point increments either asfollows or pursuant to such other criteria as the Exchange's Market SurveillanceDepartment may prescribe. In establishing his Tier 1 quote, the BBB mustround the weighted sum of the bids (offers) for the mini-basket's componentstocks down (up) to the nearest \1/8\ point and must set his bid (offer)no more than \1/8\ point lower (higher) than that rounded value. The BBBmust establish his Tier 2 bid (offer) no more than \1/4\ point lower (higher)than his Tier 1 bid (offer). When a basket order is executed at the aggregateTier 1 or Tier 2 quotation, the BBB must take or supply the necessary mini-basketsat the price indicated in the basket execution notice.\3\\1\<NOTE/> Upon the execution of a basket transaction, NYSE rule 808.15requires the BBB to report for dissemination, and submit to the Exchangefor comparison, such transaction-related information as the Exchange prescribes.\3\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ As discussed above, ESP trading initially will be availablefor executions of a standardized basket of 500 stocks based on the Sandamp;P500 Portfolio Index, which is nearly identical to the Sandamp;P 500 Index.Because the Sandamp;P 500 Portfolio Index currently is comprised of 39 stocksthat are not listed for trading on the NYSE, UTP will be necessary in orderto trade these non-NYSE-listed issues as part of an ESP stock basket. <T3>See</T3> discussion at note 6, <T3>supra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ NYSE Rule 800(b)(ix) defines the term ``mini-basket''as ``a group of stocks that consist of those of a basket's stocks thatare not listed for trading on the Exchange and whose inclusion and relativerepresentation in the group are determined by the inclusion and relativerepresentation of their current market prices in the stock index from whichthe basket is derived.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ NYSE Rule 808.20(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ NYSE Rule 808.20(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ <T3>See also</T3> NYSE Rule 817.C. ESP Trading Rules.\3\\3\1. <NOTE/> <T3>Acceptable Orders, Limit Orders and the Book.</T3> NYSE Rule 802(d)permits only market and limit orders to be entered on the basket displayunit. Additionally, in contrast to traditional block trading procedures,\3\\4\<NOTE/> the ESP rules provide no special rules to handle large ``one-sided''stock basket orders. Rather, the rules for ESP trading provide that ordersmay be executed against opposite-side limit orders on the display unitat their displayed prices, in accordance with price and time priority,until the order is filled, thereby allowing a larger buyer or seller ofbaskets to ``walk the book'' without having to effect the execution ata single ``clean-up'' price.\3\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ <T3>See</T3> File No. SR-NSCC-89-08, Securities Exchange Act Release No.27021 (July 11, 1989), 54 FR 30125 (July 18, 1989), and Securities ExchangeAct Release No. 27207 (September 1, 1989), 54 FR 37859 (September 13, 1989)for a description of the clearance and settlement rules applicable to ESPs.<T3>See also</T3> NYSE rule 817.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> NYSE rule 127.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 808(f).2. <T3>Rules of Priority, Parity and Precedence.</T3> For purposes of ESPtrading, NYSE Rule 805 makes no distinction between proprietary and customerbasket orders. Accordingly, ESP priority rules, based strictly on timeand price, apply equally to agency and principal interest.\36\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ The Exchange has proposed that the Commission initiallyapprove Rule 805 for only a six-month period. Once the Exchange has experiencein the operation of Rule 805 in the basket market, the Exchange will proposepermanent approval of Rule 805, either in its current form or modifiedin light of market experience.ESP baskets will trade in an auction market based on strict time and pricepriority, and traditional rules of priority or precedence based on sizedo not apply to ESP trading.\37\<NOTE/> The highest bid and the lowest offer will have priority.\38\<NOTE/> Aggregate Tier 1 and Tier 2 bids and offers, however, areaccorded priority over all other bids and offers at the same price. Otherwise,bids and offers displayed on the basket display unit enjoy priority basedon the order of entry into the ESP service.\39\<NOTE/> Basket orders will retain time priority once they are enteredon the display unit, and intervening trades will not result in a new auction.\40\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> NYSE Rules 71 and 72.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ NYSE Rules 805(a) and 805(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ NYSE Rules 805(b)(i) and 805(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ NYSE Rules 805(b)(iii) and 805(c).3. <T3>Crossing Orders.</T3> Under NYSE Rule 805(d), a member may cross twoagency orders without exposing either side, but only at a price that isbetter than the best bid and offer on the ESP display unit and only ifthe crossing price is announced to the trading crowd. Thus, a Floor brokeror CBMM can cleanly cross customer orders for ESPs anywhere within theprevailing ESP quote, by executing the cross on the Floor, and then givingit to the BBB to enter into the system.\41\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ As stated <T3>supra</T3> note 3, the Exchange has proposed that the Commission approveRule 805 for only a six-month period.CBMMs also can enter agency crosses through their terminals by sequentialentry of each side, although they risk a break-up during the time it takesto enter the second side. In either case, if the crossing price is at oraway from the prevailing bid of offer, the broker or CBMM can execute thecross only by clearing the book of all quotes that have priority.

IOC orders may be placed at anytime during the day prior to the close of trading, but only as crosses.Because the closing Sandamp;P 500 Index value is based on the weighted sumof the closing prices of the 500 component stocks, the IOC trade pricewill be appended and disseminated after the 4:00 execution of the IOC orders.\46\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 802.20.6. <T3>Trading Halts and Call Markets.</T3> ESP basket trading would haltunder NYSE Rule 816(b) when market activity triggers the Rule 80B ``circuitbreakers''.\47\<NOTE/> Moreover, under NYSE Rule 816(b), the Exchange's Senior Officersor Floor Directors can halt ESP trading when the condition of the marketso warrants.\48\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ NYSE Rule 80B, the Exchange's ``circuit breaker'' rule,provides procedures for one-hour trading halt in the trading of all securitiesafter a 250-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA'')and a two-hour trading halt after a 400-point decline. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26198 (October 19, 1988),53 FR 41637 (order approving NYSE, American Stock Exchange, Chicago BoardOptions Exchange, and National Association of Securities Dealers circuitbreaker proposals).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ The Commission notes in addition that the practical effectof a Commission-ordered suspension of trading in a basket component stockpursuant to section 12(k) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 781(k), would be a haltin ESP basket trading. Because transactions in such a security would beprohibited while such a trading halt was in effect, basket transactionscould not take place until the suspension of trading ended.In addition, under Rule 816(b) and the Basket Guidelines, a call marketis mandatory if more than 30% of the weighted value of the index is notopen for trading <T3>and</T3> trading in the related futures contract has reached the dailyprice limit (or trading in the contract has halted).

The Exchange contends that the ESP service will address marketinefficiencies resulting from the fragmented executions currently accordedprogram trading strategies.\5\\7\<NOTE/> The Exchange believes that the proposed ESP market structureis designed to attract and concentrate the ``block positioning''\5\\8\<NOTE/> capital necessary to support ESP trading. The Exchange furtherbelieves that ESP trading will reduce the transaction and price impactcosts associated with current index-related trading strategies throughthe ESP service's single, aggregated execution function. Finally, the Exchangestates that the ESP trading service may reduce the price volatility associatedwith institutional demands and selling pressures that their index-orientedtrading strategies currently transmit to individual component stocks andwhich may translate into overall market volatility.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\7\ ``Program trading'' generally is defined as the simultaneousentry, but separate execution, of multiple orders together in a packagetrade.

Program trading includes the purchases or sales ofstocks that are part of a coordinated trading strategy, even if the purchasesor sales are neither entered or executed contemporaneously, not part ofa trading strategy involving options or futures contracts on an index stockgroup, or options on any such futures contracts, or otherwise relatingto a stock market index.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\ Section 3(a)(38) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(38),defines the term ``market maker'' as ``any dealer acting in the capacityof a block positioner.''

TheCommission received a comment letter from the Commodity Futures TradingCommission (``CFTC'') \5\\9\<NOTE/> stating that ESP transactions are ``spot transactions insecurities'', and therefore are not ``contracts of sale of a commodityfor future delivery under section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Commodity ExchangeAct.'' \6\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Jean A.

Donovan, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, CBOT, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated July 17, 1989.A third comment letter was received from the Alliance of Floor Brokers(``AFB''),\6\\2\<NOTE/> whose membership is comprised predominantly of NYSE Floorbrokers. In general, the AFB letter criticizes certain aspects of the ESPmarket structure as anti-competitive. The AFB also believes that ESP tradingmay exacerbate structural market risks that already exist because of theunequal regulatory treatment accorded derivative products. The AFB arguesthat, in comparison to existing equity auction market trading procedures,the alternative trading procedures envisioned by the ESP system ultimatelywould result in a fragmented securities market structure with increasedmarket volatility. In a report appended to its comment letter, the AFBmade the following specific comments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\2\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Michael D. Robbins, President, AFB, to JonathanG. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated July 13, 1989.(1) The AFB criticized the lack of compatibility of the ESP rules packagewith traditional auction market concepts embodied in NYSE Rule 92 thatattempt to eliminate conflicts of interest that may arise in an auctionmarket environment. The AFB argued that a CBMM should be required to handoff all customer orders to an independent agent if the CBMM seeks to continueto trade for its own account.(2) The AFB contends that parity\63\<NOTE/> should be allowed at the basket point-of-sale, because absolutetime and price priority will serve to dampen participation by portfoliomanagers if they must reveal their trading intentions in advance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ Namely, customer orders and proprietary orders are accordedequal execution priorities.(3) The AFB argues that all crosses, whether agency to agency or principalto agency, should be subject to price betterment at the basket point-of-saleand that all brokers, not just CBMMs, should be permitted to effect facilitationcrosses.(4) The AFB argues for more basket order interaction with the ``tradingcrowd,'' and contends that the BBB should be allowed to stop basket commitmentswhenever appropriate in the hope of achieving price improvement.(5) The AFB contends that when a specialist receives a basket executionnotice, that execution should receive a better price in the equity pieceswhenever available at the equity point-of-sale.(6) The AFB contends that the ability of a larger buyer or seller to disadvantagethe limit orders on the book essentially with prior knowledge that inferiorpriced prints will take place is counter to existing block trading rules.Specifically, the AFB argues that this type of dealing is predatory whenthe prior knowledge is shared with a market maker who then takes part ofthe contra side at a clean up price after intervening public orders havebeen disadvantaged. Accordingly, the AFB believes some form of block tradingprotection is necessary for ESP transactions.(7) The AFB agreed with the Exchange's logic supporting its request forshort sale relief when the specialist is required to participate in anexecution and the specialist is short the stock. The AFB also supportedthe Exchange's request for short sale relief when a CBMM supplies stockon a minus or zero-minus tick because the prices of the individual equityprices are priced independently. The AFB, however, criticized the NYSE'srequest to extend short sale relief to the basket point-of-sale as a potentiallydisruptive deregulatory initiative. The AFB also claims that such reliefwould foment a regime of anti-competitive and inequitable short sale regulationin comparison to the regulation of the short selling of individual stocks.Specifically, the AFB posits the example of shorting an industry group(<T3>i.e.</T3>, oil stocks) through ESP short sales in a fashion that isotherwise not available in the retail equity market.Richard Ney andamp; Associates Asset Management Inc. (``Ney''), an investmentmanagement company, criticized the configuration of ESP transaction reporting.\64\<NOTE/> The Commission also received letters from Thomas G. and RuthM. Roberts (``the Roberts'') and from Dr. Burton Roger (``Dr. Roger''),individual investors residing in California, who similarly criticized theExchange's proposed transaction reporting plan as it would apply to thebasket's constituent stocks.\65\<NOTE/> Specifically, Ney, the Roberts, and Dr. Roger criticizedthe lack of real time price and volume reporting for the ESP stock componentswhen NYSE specialists do not participate in a basket execution. TuckerAnthony, Inc. (``Tucker Anthony''), an investment management firm,\66\<NOTE/> criticizes the ESP system as an institutional and proprietarytrading vehicle whose trading will increase market volatility.

The Exchange believes that the rules supporting ESP trading aredesigned appropriately to accommodate the particular needs of the portfoliomarket in a fair and competitive market structure.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ <T3>See</T3> letter from James E. Buck, Secretary, NYSE, to Mary Revell,Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated September 6, 1989.In response to the specific issues raised in the comment letters, the Exchangemade the following comments.(1) In response to the concern that the proposed ESP market structure wouldrequire CBMMs to make markets while allowing them to handle customer orders,the Exchange contends that if CBMMs cannot trade for their own accountswhile holding customer orders, they would either have to cease providingtwo-sided quotations while holding customer orders, or they would haveto hand off all of their customer orders. The Exchange concluded that theformer alternative would lead to inadequte support for the product, whilethe latter alternative ignores a fundamental market reality, namely, thatthe potential ESP market-making firms are the very same firms that arelikely to handle customer orders. Accordingly, the Exchange struck a balancebetween the two competing concerns by proposing a basket market structurethat allows a market maker holding customer orders to maintain a two-sidedquotation, while executing customer orders against those quotations andotherwise trading in furtherance of its affirmative obligations.(2) In response to the contention that parity should be allowed at thebasket point-of-sale, the Exchange contends that absolute time and pricepriority is essential to attracting upstairs capital to the ESP basketmarket. The Exchange states that strict priorities are necessary to assureupstairs market makers that an order will be executed when the market reachesthe specified price, thus providing them with an incentive to place andleave orders in the system. The Exchange notes that the minimum ESP tickis 1/100th the size of the tick in the average Exchange-traded stock, andshould provide traders ample room to compete by betttering the market.(3) In response to the suggestion that all crosses should be subject toprice betterment at the basket point-of-sale, the Exchange stated thatit believes that the limitations on when ESP crosses must be exposed forprice improvement are reasonable when viewed in the context of the absolutetime and price priorities imposed by the ESP rules. The Exchange contendsthat no exposure is necessary for agency crosses because both sides ofthe order will receive prices better than the prevailing quotations inthe market. The Exchange further contends that the lack of exposure forprincipal crosses when the price to the customer is a minimum tick insidethe bid or offer is reasonable because the customer receives an immediateexecution at the best available price. In addition, it encourages marketmakers to bring order flow to the Floor because it provides them with certaintyin executing crosses, so long as they are prepared to provide the customerthe best possible price.In response to the argument that all brokers should be able to effect facilitationcrosses, the Exchange stated its belief that allowing only CBMMs to effectproprietary crosses is an appropriate limitation when viewed in the overallcontext of the ESP market structure. In particular, because market makerswill assume significant obligations and will incur significant costs inhelping to maintain a fair and orderly market, the Exchange believes itis reasonable to limit to CBMMs the ability to effect facilitation crosses.The Exchange believes that without this limitation it would be difficultto attract sufficient market-making expertise.(4) The Exchange notes, in response to the argument for more basket orderinteraction with the trading crowd, that the ESP rules provide for priceimprovement at the basket point-of-sale: because orders are ``flashed''electronically to all market participants, both upstairs and Floor traderscan interact with that order and improve the best bid or offer in the system.(5) In response to the argument for price improvement at the equity point-of-sale,the Exchange argues that the issue of possible price improvement at theequity point-of-sale in a basket execution that involves Tier 1 or Tier2 specialist participation arises because the specialist's aggregate quotationsare updated only every 15 seconds, and an unavoidable delay occurs betweenthe basket execution and the integration of that execution in the marketsfor the component stocks. As a result, when a specialist receives a basketexecution notice, there could be a quotation in the stock superior to theprice specified in the notice. The Exchange contends that it is reasonableto award the benefits of the improved price to the participant in the marketfor the component stock, who is much more likely to be a retail customerinterested in receiving the best price for his order. The Exchange furthercontends that such a resoluton is a reasonable one for a basket customerwho may view a speedy execution with price certainty as more importantthan a relatively insignificant improvement in the price of a $5 millionbasket.(6) In response to concerns raised regarding the ability of large buyersor sellers to walk the book, the Exchange notes that the ESP basket marketis an institutional market comprised of the equivalent of large block orderscompeting for execution according to strict price and time priorities.Accordingly, the Exchange believes that ESP trading does not require aregulatory structure modeled on its retail auction market which is designedto integrate both retail and institutional order flow and to protect retailorder flow from inferior block executions at ``gap'' prices.\71\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 127.(7) Finally, in response to concerns raised about the NYSE proposal forrelief from the short sale rule, the Exchange notes that ESPs, much likeoptions and futures, will be priced derivatively. Because the Exchangealso expects ESP trading to be somewhat discontinuous, with potentiallylong intervals between trades, the Exchange believes that there is notlikely to be much of a price relationship between the last tick in theESP market and the actual direction of market movements in the ESP marketand the actual direction of market movements in the component stocks. TheExchange contends, moreover, that it is impractical to apply the shortsale rule at the basket point-of-sale since it will not be easy to determinewhen a person is ``short'' a basket that contains 500 component stocks.Thus, the Exchange reasons that it is impractical and competitively disadvantageousto apply short sale restrictions at the basket point-of-sale.In response to the suggestion that a market participant might use the marketbasket to short a particular industry group, the Exchange counters thatthe risk inherent in such a trading strategy is prohibitively expensive,because the trader would be required to cover the unwanted stock shortpositions at a price no higher than the price at which it sold the stocks.Moreover, the Exchange notes that the general anti-fraud rules of the Exchangeand the Commission will apply fully to ESP trading, and that the Exchange'sdetailed surveillance procedures will operate to capture any such anomaloustrading patterns that may evidence a manipulative or otherwise fraudulenttrading strategy.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion.</ITAG>A. IntroductionAfter careful consideration of the comments received, applicable statutoryprovisions, and relevant policy considerations, the Commission believesthat the NYSE's basket trading proposal is reasonably desinged to preventfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitableprinciples of trades, provide for an equitable allocation of fees, andis consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. For thesereasons and for the additional reasons set forth below, the Commissionfinds that approval of the Exchange's proposed rule change relating tostock basket trading is consistent with the requirements of the Act andthe rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securitiesexchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of sections 6(b) (4)and (5).\72\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (4) and (5) (1982).B.

This could addan additional layer of liquidity and concentrated capital to the marketin order to help absorb the volume and velocity of trading associated withindex-related trading strategies.\76\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ SEC, Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break</T3> (February 1988) (``Staff Report'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ <T3>See also,</T3> Securities and Exchange Commission Recommendations Regardingthe October 1987 Market Break contained in Testimony of David S.

Grundfest, ``WouldMore Regulation Prevent Another black Monday?'', Address before the CATOInstitute Policy Forum on July 20, 1988, at 13-14 (available at the Commission);H. Stoll and R.

Stoll, <T3>Portfolio Trading,</T3> Working Paper No. 87-14 (September 1987) (availableat the Owen Graduate School of Management, Vanderbilt University).Furthermore, because ESP market basket will be traded on the Exchange Floorat a single location in an ``open book'' environment, members in the crowdwill be able to see both the ESP bid-offer spread and the depth of theESP market, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the size of the buying and/or selling interest at each minimumtick away from the prevailing bid and offer for the basket. Program tradingorder flow entered into the system and imbalances resulting therefrom thuswill be disclosed, thereby ameliorating curent market information limitationsin identifying program trade executions (or overhanging program orders)in the individual stocks.\77\<NOTE/> Finally, by creating a trading vehicle for an aggregatedbasket of standardized portfolios of stocks in a single execution withminimal ``execution slippage,'' \78\<NOTE/> the ESP trading system will provide an efficient mechanismto trade, clear and settle stock baskets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ The NYSE's concept of an open, fully-disclosed book tosupport ESP trading is consistent with suggestions offered by various studiesof the October 1987 Market Break. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> the Brady Report, <T3>supra</T3> note 75 at vii. <T3>See also</T3> Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, <T3>Reflections on the Stock Market Crash of October 1987</T3> (January25, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ ``Execution slippage'' may be defined as the adverseprice impact that currently accompanies the fragmented execution of programtrades. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> the Katzenbach Report at note 29.The Commission believes the ESP trading will provide institutional investorswith a cost efficient means to make investment decisions based on the directionof standardized measures of stock market segments and the stock marketas a whole, and may provide stock market participants several advantagesover existing methods of effecting progam trades of stocks and transactionsin portfolios of securities. The Commission recognizes that the ESP marketwill have different trading dynamics than the market for the individualstocks, and that the regulatory structure for individual stocks may notbe best suited for ESP trading. For the reasons discussed below, the Commissionfinds that the deviations from this structure proposed by the NYSE reasonablyare designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and fairand orderly markets. Furthermore, the Commission believes that ESP tradingwill not lead unduly toward a more fragmented and volatile market, becausethe ``open book'' environment, customer crossing and facilitation rules,and the combination of both ``auction'' and ``dealer'' attributes in thetrading system for ESPs are consistent with the development of an openand competitive national market system.C. MarginAs discussed above, ESP trades would be subject to the to percent initialmargin requirement applicable to exchange-traded equity securities. Marketmakers who are designated as CBMMs in the ESP market basket would be treatedas specialist for margin purposes, and would be entitled to good faithmargin treatment for ESP transactions effected in their CBMM account.Because the purchase of an ESP results in the physical delivery of eachstock composing the basket, Regulation T requires a 50 percent initialmargin requirement. For the same reasons, the Commission believes thatit is appropriate to apply the NYSE equity security maintenance marginrequirement of 25 percent to ESPs.The Commission also finds that, in light of their affirmative market makingobligations, the NYSE proposal appropriately treats CBMMs as ``specialists''for the purpose of receiving exempt credit treatment under Regulation Tand U.\79\<NOTE/> In order for CBMMs to qualify for exempt credit, however,the Commission believes that it is necessary for CBMMs to segregate market-makingpositions from other positions (<T3>e.g.,</T3> proprietary and arbitrage transactions).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ The BBB also will be entitled to exempt credit, but onlywith respect to transactions entered into pursuant to its role as passivemarket maker in the ``mini-basket.''D. Agency Crosses, Proprietary Tradingand Customer FacilitationsRule 805(d) provides that any member or member organization may cross agencyorders. As discussed above, however, under NYSE Rules 806 and 809 onlyCBMMs can initiate basket trades for their own accounts on the Floor orfrom terminals, and CBMMs alone will be able to facilitate customer ordersthrough proprietary trading on the Floor.80<NOTE/> Thus, only CBMMs may effect proprietary cross transactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>80 A non-CBMM member may initiate proprietary basket tradeson the Floor to offset a basket transaction made in error, however, or,subject to NYSE Rule 92, a non-CBMM member on the Floor may accept proprietarybasket orders initiated off the Floor.In response to concerns voiced by the commentators that these provisionswere anti-competitive, the Exchange contended that such a structural tradeoffwas necessary to attract sufficient upstairs market-making participation.81<NOTE/> In return for this trading ``monopoly'', the Exchange emphasizedthat CBMMs will be required to undertake specific affirmative obligationsin connection with their ESP market-making operations. For example, Rule807 establishes affirmative market-making obligations, including the requirementto maintain a fair and orderly ESP market. Moreover, CBMMs must help alleviatetemporary disparity between supply and demand through proprietary tradingoperations. In addition, CBMMs also must maintain a continuous, two-sidedfirm quotation in the basket.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>81 NYSE September 6 letter, <T3>supra</T3> note 70.The Exchange also emphasized that CBMMs will incur the terminal and othersystems and personnel costs necessary to support their market-making function.Furthermore, once registered, operation of a CBMM franchise demonstratesa significant capital commitment to the ESP market because a CBMM willnot be permitted to withdraw its registration except on 30 days' notice,82<NOTE/> and if a CBMM does withdraw its registration, it will notbe permitted to re-register for 30 additional days.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>82 In addition, because the member or member organizationmay not give such notice prior to the 60th day after its registration becomeseffective, a CBMM must continue to function as such for at least 90 days.<T3>See</T3> Basket Guidelines.The Commission believes that the unique capabilities provided to marketmakers in the ESP market raise difficult questions under the Act. On theone hand, the limitations on direct proprietary facilitations by otherNYSE members may discourage their use of ESPs, thus reducing liquidity.On the other hand, the NYSE is attempting to provide, through CBMM participation,a continous basket trading market, something which has heretofore beenunavailable. It is difficult to predict whether the market will expandand be characterized by active basket trading, or whether trading willbe sporadic. At least in its initial stages, when the latter assumptionmay be correct, the Commission finds that it is consistent with the Actfor the NYSE to build in necessary incentives to ensure active market-makingparticipation. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to approve, ona temporary six-month basis, the NYSE's limitations on proprietary tradingcontained in NYSE Rule 806. If during the next six months, however, ESPsbecome actively traded, no artificial market-making incentives should benecessary and the Commission would expect the NYSE to revise its rulesto permit basket trading and facilitation by all member firms.E. Customer Protection Rules and Rules of Priority, Parity and Precedence<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Customer Protection</ITAG>NYSE Rule 92 protects against conflicts of interest when a member holdsa customer order and trades for a proprietary account by imposing specificrequirements on how the member must price and handle customer orders inthese circumstances. Under NYSE Rule 800(c)(i), however, a member who holdsor has knowledge of a customer's unexecuted order for one or more of abasket's component stocks still may initiate proprietary basket transactions,despite the otherwise contrary application of Rule 92. Thus, while holdingcustomer orders, the ESP rules allow a market maker to maintain a two-sidedquotation, executing customer orders against those quotations and otherwisetrading in furtherance of its affirmative obligations. The Rule 92 restrictionsapply when a CBMM seeks to trade for its own account at the then-prevailingbid or offer (if not pursuant to its affirmative obligations), or to breakup a facilitation.83<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>831 <T3>See supra</T3> note 44.The Commission believes that the exceptions proposed for CBMMs are appropriatemeasures to facilitate liquidity in an institutional market. Because ofthe size of the ESP's unit of trading and the screen-based trading systememployed, ESPs require the participation of large, well-capitalized upstairsfirms. Because these firms are integrated, any restriction on their abilityto handle customer orders almost certainly would discourage them from registeringas CBMMs. While the Commission is concerned over the potential that CBMMsmight prefer their own proprietary order over a customer order or ``frontrun''that customer order, the Commission recognizes that effectively the samepotential for abuse exists today when upstairs firms execute programs throughthe NYSE's Designated Order Turnaround (``DOT'') system. The Commissionis satisfied that the NYSE's present surveillance and examination programsare capable of detecting any such improper trading. The Commission alsonotes that the Rule 92 restrictions still apply when a CBMM seeks to ``hit''the then-prevailing bid or offer for a proprietary account (if not pursuantto its affirmative obligations), or to break up a facilitation. Accordingly,in light of the unique market structure of ESPs and the institutional natureof the market, the Commission finds that the NYSE's limitation of Rule92 is consistent with the Act.2. <T3>Rules of Priority, Parity and Precedence.</T3> Pursuant to NYSE Rule805, the ESP basket market will trade under a regime of strict price andtime priority. Accordingly, for purposes of determining ESP execution priorities,there is no distinction between proprietary and customer basket order.\84\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ In contrast, Rule 11a1-1(T)(a)(3) under the Act, 17 CFR240.11a1-1(T)(a)(3), generally provides an exemption from Section 11(a)conditioned on providing customer orders priority over orders of the exchangemember handling those orders at the same price. Members whose ESP ordersare subject to Section 11(a)'s limitations will have available the exemptionsprovided in Rule 11a2-2(T) as well as Rule 11a1-1(T) in executing theseorders.The Commission agrees with the Exchange that rules of time and price priorityare appropriate in an institutional basket product that will trade in lotsof $5 million. Coupled with the ``open book'' environment of the ESP basketmarket, rules of time priority should promote a more ``transparent'' ESPmarket by providing institutions with an incentive to place and leave ordersin the system. This should result in order flow and imbalances being morefully disclosed, thereby ameliorating current market information limitationsthat may result when program trades are executed in the individual stocks.The alternative of granting institutional customer orders a preferenceover market maker orders would allow institutions to price broker-dealerCBMMs out of the market without those institutions accepting the affirmativeobligations required of market makers. The result might be significantdisincentives to market making and less liquidity. Accordingly, becausethe Commission believes that strict time and price priority provides afair market regimen for ESPs, the Commission has determined to approvedNYSE Rule 805 for a six-month period. F. Price Improvement and Price ProtectionAs discussed above, the ESP rules provide variations from the usual NYSEmarket structure in several other instances to accommodate ESP trading.First, the rules for ESP trading allow orders to be executed against opposite-sidelimit orders on the display unit at their displayed prices, in accordancewith price and time priority, until the order is filled, thereby allowinga larger buyer or seller of baskets to ``walk the book'' without havingto effect the execution at a single ``clean-up''price.\85\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 808(f).Second, the proposed ESP rules \86\<NOTE/> provide that when a specialist receives a notice indicatingthe execuion of a Tier 1 or Tier 2 basket trade, he or she must assignthat interest at the price specified in the notice to whomever has priorityat that time or take or supply the component stock at the execution price.\87\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ <T3>See</T3> proposed NYSE Rule 104.11A(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ Moreover, although NYSE Rule 812 requires a CBMM to guaranteethe purchase or sale of a basket at the price at which he ``stops'' a basket,the Exchange is not requiring the BBB to ``stop'' basket market ordersto achieve price improvement. Because of the fact that ESP baskets tradein lots of $5 million, the Commission believes it is reasonable for theExchange not to require the BBB to stop basket orders in what may proveto be an illusory attempt at achieving price improvement, because the BBBwould ultimately bear the risk of any adverse market moves whenever itwould stop a basket commitment.The Commission believes that the trading rules proposed by the NYSE areconsistent with the Act. The ``gap pricing'' protections set forth in NYSERule 127 for block transactions in individual securities are designed toensure that small public limit orders do not receive block executions inferiorto those of the block trade. Application of similar protections in theESP market would first raise difficult definitional questions as to whatwas an ESP block. In addition, it is not clear that the sophisticated institutionsparticipating in the ESP market require the identical protections developedfor retail public investors in the equity market. In this connection, itis important to note that the absolute time priority provided in the ESPmarket protects limit orders from being ``sized out'' by larger ordersthat would be provided precedence in the market for individual securities.Therefore, the Commission believes that the absence of gap pricing protectionsfor ESP limit orders in light of the institutional nature of the marketand the advantage provided limit orders by time priority is appropriate.Similarly, the Commission believes that the special rules regarding Tier1 and Tier 2 specialist executions are appropriate because it is reasonableto award the benefit of any improved price to the participant in the marketfor the component stock, who is much more likely to be a retail customerinterested in receiving the best price for his order, and because a basketcustomer is likely to view a speedy execution with price certainty as moreimportant than a relatively insignificant improvement in the price of a$5 million basket.G. Exemption RequestsThe Exchange has requested that the Commission grant exemptions from Rules10a-1, 10b-6, 10b-7, 10b-8, 10b-10, 10b-13, 15c1-5, and 15c1-6 under theAct \8\\8\<NOTE/> to facilitate trading in ESPs.\8\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\8\ 17 CFR 240.10a-1, 240.10b-6, 240.10b-7, 240.10b-8,240.10b-10, 240.10b-13, 240.15c1-5 and 240.15c1-6 (1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\9\ <T3>See</T3> letters from Donald J. Solodar, Senior Vice President, NYSE,to Larry Bergmann, Associate Director, SEC, dated September 25 and October12, 1989.Rule 10a-1 provides that short sales \9\\0\<NOTE/> of exchange-listed securities may not be effected at a priceless than the price at which the immediately preceding sale was effected(``minus tick'') or at a price equal to the last sale if the last precedingtransaction at a different price was at a higher price (``zero-minus tick'').The Exchange has requested relief from Rule 10a-1 in three areas. First,the Exchange seeks an exemption form Rule 10a-1 as it would apply to theindividual component stocks traded in an ESP transaction and to transactionsin the ESPs themselves. Second, the Exchange requests an exemption analogousto the ``block positioner'' exemption in paragraph (e)(13) of Rule 10a-1.\9\\1\<NOTE/> The requested exemption would permit CBMMs selling stockacquired in an ESP transaction to disregard, when netting positions forpurposes of Rule 10a-1, a short position that is the subject of one ormore offsetting positions created in the course of bona fide arbitrage,risk arbitrage, or bona fide hedging activities. Third, the Exchange isrequesting relief from the operation of the short sale rule as it wouldapply to a specialist's obligation to trade for its own account when thespecialist participates in a Tier 1 or a Tier 2 execution through a ``passivesale,'' <T3>i.e.</T3>, when the specialist is acting as the seller of last resortwho is required to fulfill a trading commitment at a given price.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\0\ A short sale is defined in Rule 3b-3 under the Act,17 CFR 240.3b-3, as any sale of a security that the seller does not ownor any sale that is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowedby, or for the account of, the seller. Rule 3b-3 provides further thata person shall be deemed to own a security only to the exent that thatperson has a net long position in that security.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\1\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20715 (March 6, 1984),49 FR 9414 (March 13, 1984).Rule 10b-6 limits the ability of underwriters, issuers, or certain otherpersons to bid for or purchase a security being distributed, or a relatedsecurity, during the distribution of that security. Rule 10b-7 regulatesstabilizing transactions in connection with an offering of securities.Rule 10b-8 restricts bids and purchases of rights, and offers and salesof the underlying stock, by persons participating in a rights offering.Rule 10b-10 requires broker-dealers to provide customers with a writtenconfirmation that includes the identity, price, and number of shares orunits of a security purchased or sold by the customer.\9\\2\<NOTE/> Rule 10b-13 prohibits persons making a tender offer for asecurity from purchasing or arranging to purchase that security otherwisethan pursuant to the tender offer. Rule 15c1-5 requires a broker-dealerto disclose that it has a control relationship with an issuer before executinga transaction in that issuer's securities. Rule 15c1-6 requires a broker-dealerto disclose any participation or financial interest in the distributionof a security, at or before the completion of a transaction in such securityfor the account of a customer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\2\ <T3>See</T3> notes 54-56, <T3>supra</T3> and accompanying text for a description of the NYSE's proposedmethodology for allocating an execution price to each component stock ina basket.The Commission believes that transactions in ESPs generally do not involvethe same concerns that are applicable to transactions in individual stocks,and that appropriate conditional relief from Rules 10a-1, 10b-6, 10b-7,10b-8, 10b-10 is necessary if the benefits of ESP trading are to be achieved.With respect to Rules 15c1-5 and 15c1-6, in recognition of the unique natureof ESP transactions, the Division has determined that transactions in ESPsare unlikely to give rise to the abuses the rules were designed to preventand accordingly, the Division is taking a no-action position under theserules. Accordingly, the Commission's staff today has issued a letter grantingcertain exemptions and taking certain no-action positions with respectto the treatment of transactions in ESPs under these rules.H. NYSE Rules 95, 96, 97, 104, 107, 112 and 312(g)A variety of Exchange rules impose transaction restrictions designed toameliorate conflicts of interest that arise in connection with the intersectionof proprietary trading operations and customer operations. Proposed Rule800(c) would exempt ESP trading from these customer protection rules.For example, NYSE Rule 95.20 generally prohibits specialists from initiatingdiscretionary orders in specialty stocks. Proposed NYSE Rule 800(c)(ii)would allow a specialist to originate basket orders for discretionary accountseven if the basket contains his specialty stocks, despite the otherwisecontrary provisions of NYSE Rule 95.20. Similarly, a member who holds orhas granted an option on a basket's component stock may still initiateproprietary basket transactions under Rule 800(c)(iii), despite the otherwisecontrary operation of Rule 96.Exchange Rule 97 generally restricts block positioners from trading ina manipulative manner that would be inconsistent with the informationaladvantages derived from the intersection of their customer and proprietarytrading operations. Proposed Rule 800(c)(iv) exempts a member from theoperation of the otherwise applicable tick tests contained in Rule 97 ifhe or she has acquired a long stock position as a result of a member'sbasket transactions.Additionally, a stock specialist may initiate basket transactions underRule 800(c)(v), even if the basket contains a specialty stock, despitethe otherwise contrary provisions of Rule 104. Nevertheless, under Rule800(c)(vi), a specialist, registered competitive market maker or competitivetrader must include in any calculation of his aggregate stock positionany stock that he has acquired by means of one or more basket transactionsfor the purposes of the stock trading limitations imposed by Rules 104,107 and 112. Finally, NYSE Rule 312(g) places restrictions on an Exchange member corporationeffecting transactions, or making recommendations, in its own securitiesor in securities issued by any corporation controlling, controlled by,or under common control with the member corporations (collectively, an``affiliated issue''). The rule is designed to protect against potentialconflicts of interest and potential misuses of corporate information. Appliedliterally to basket trading, however, the rule would prohibit a memberfirm that is affiliated to any of the component companies included in astandardized market basket product approved by the Commission from: (1)Making recommendations or effecting customer transactions in baskets, (2)making a market in baskets, or (3) executing ``split'' orders for customersin baskets if the customer wanted to exclude the stock of the affiliatedissuer, because the member firm would have to buy or sell the stock forits own account to accommodate the customer. Paragraph (vii) of NYSE Rule 800(c) would apply Rule 312(g) to market baskets\93\<NOTE/> as follows: (1) Member corporations of the NYSE would bepermitted to recommend and effect customer market basket transactions withoutrestrictions; (2) an Exchange member corporation that is a market makerin stock baskets (<T3>e.g., </T3>CBMMs on the NYSE or other exchange-designated basket marketmakers) would be permitted to buy and sell baskets for proprietary accountswithout restrictions; (3) if an Exchange member that is a CBMM or otherexchange-designated basket market maker liquidates one or more componentstock positions with respect to a basket that it holds in its market-makinginventory, the CBMM or such other exchange-designated basket market makerwill have until the close of the day following such action to liquidateits position in the stock of an affiliated issuer; and (4) if an Exchangemember corporation that is neither a CBMM nor a basket market maker designatedon another exchange acquires a position in the stock of an affiliated issuerthrough its execution of a split order, the member corporation would haveuntil the close of business on the day following the transaction to disposeof the position in the stock of the affiliated issuer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ Amendment No. 3 to the Exchange's rule filing clarifiesthat the operation of NYSE Rule 800(c)(vii) is generic in its applicationto baskets traded on other national securities exchanges. The Exchange contends that the Rule 800(c) provisions appropriately balancecustomer protection concerns against potential conflicts that could arisewhile members and member organizations service customers and provide liquidityto the basket market. Consistent with the no-action position taken by theCommission staff with regard to the operation of Rules 15c1-5 and 15c1-6under the Act,\94\<NOTE/> the Commission believes that the amended operation of ExchangeRules 95, 96, 97, 104, 107, 112 and 312(g) as they relate to ESP tradingstrike an appropriate balance between customer protection concerns andany potential trading abuses by members and member organizations, becauseinvestors will make basket trading decisions based on the market as a wholeand not on stock-specific criteria, and any proprietary trading undertakenby a member or member organization in this connection does not entail themanipulative concerns that these Exchange rules are intended to addressin the context of individual stock trading. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ <T3>See </T3>note 92 <T3>supra </T3>and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Transaction and Quotation Data Reporting </ITAG>Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act,\95\<NOTE/> the NYSE is required to collect and disseminate transactiondata on securities listed and traded on the Exchange. The NYSE will providetrading facilities through the ESP service for reported securities (ascomponents of baskets) but will not report transactions in the componentstocks, as is required by Rule 11Aa3-1.\96\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\95\ Rule 11Aa3-1, the transaction reporting rule, generallyrequires that exchanges file transaction reporting plans governing thecollection, processing and dissemination of last sale data on securitiestraded on the exchanges. 17 CFR 240.11Aa3-1 (1989). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\96\ By separate order, The Commission has granted the NYSEan exemption from this requirement. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27390 (October 26, 1989).The Exchange intends to disseminate basket last sale information and quotationsto market data vendors, thereby assuring that all ESP market participantswill have ready access to the ESP transaction reports and quotations. Tier1 and Tier 2 executions in the NYSE-listed component stocks will be disseminatedto market data vendors in the same manner as individual executions in thecomponent stocks. In addition, proposed Rule 803 will impose on membersobligations consistent with those imposed by Rule 11Ac1-1 under the Act\97\<NOTE/> and Exchange Rule 60 with respect to the quotations for individualstocks. Basket quotations always will be firm under Rule 803, except whenthe market is in a call mode. However, outside of the existing marketsin the individual component stocks trading on the Exchange in compliancewith Rules 11Aa3-1 and 11Ac1-1, no quotes or last sale reporting will beavailable for the individual constituent stocks that comprise a stock basketwhen it trades under the ESP market structure, unless an order is executedagainst a Tier 1 or Tier 2 aggregate quotation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\97\ 17 CFR 240.11Ac1-1 (1989). Rule 11Ac1-1 imposes quotecollection obligations on exchanges and associations and requires broker-dealerquotations, subject to specific exceptions, to be firm at the price andsize publicly disseminated. The Commission notes that Rule 11Ac1-1 appliesto quotations for ESP baskets. For the frist six months of ESP trading, the NYSE will not disseminateon a consolidated basis the total trading volume for each of the componentstocks represented by ESP transactions either during or after the tradingday. The NYSE believes that its proposal to exclude end-of-day transactionvolume in the ESP component stocks from the consolidated transaction volumefigures is appropriate to provide the Commission and the Exchange withan opportunity to assess whether the absence of individual basket componentstocks in the end-of-day consolidated volume figures merits modificationin light of actual trading experience.\98\<NOTE/> The NYSE has, however, committed at the end of the firstsix months of basket trading to submit to the Commission a proposed rulechange that will provide for the inclusion of end-of-day transaction volumein the ESP component stocks in the consolidated transaction volume figures.\99\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\98\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Richard A. Grasso, President and CEO, NYSE, toBrandon C. Becker, Associate Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC,dated October 4, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\99\ <T3>Id. </T3>The Exchange has reserved the right to provide views and informationthat would express its continued opposition to the addition of end-of-daytransaction volume in the ESP component stocks in the consolidated transactionvolume figures. Ney, the Roberts, and Dr. Roger criticized the proposed configuration ofESP transaction reporting, which would not include price and volume breakdownsin the component stocks of a basket trade. Because ESP trades are executedat aggregated prices, the Exchange contends that a last sale reportingrequirement for the price and volume of a basket's individual componentstocks does not translate well into the ESP context.The Commission agrees with the Exchange that, with the exception of specialistTier 1 and Tier 2 executions, real-time last sale and volume reportingfor the individual component stocks underlying a basket trade would notbe appropriate in the ESP context. Pricing of the baskets is based on theaggregate value of the underlying securities and thus any assignment ofa ``price'' to any of the component stocks in the basket would be arbitrary.For these reasons, the Commission believes that the proposed reportingrequirements, even though they deviate to a certain extent from the requirementsof Rule 11Aa3-1, are, nevertheless, consistent with the Act. In addition,the Commission believes that a six-month delay in implementing consolidatedreporting of end-of-day transaction volume in the basket component stocksis reasonable in order to determine whether such consolidation would provideuseful information to market participants. The Commission believes that conditional relief from Rule 11Aa3-1 for ESPtransactions is necessary and appropriate. Accordingly, the Commissionhas issued an order exempting the NYSE from certain requirements in thatrule with respect to transactions in ESPs.\100\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\100\ <T3>See supra</T3> note 96.J. Surveillance Procedures The proposed ESP market structure raises various surveillance concerns.The Commission believes that the Exchange's enhanced ESP surveillance proceduresshould capture any potentially abusive trading practices of market participantsattempting to profit unfairly from the information advantages that theirfiduciary and market positions entail. In this connection, the Commissionexpects the Exchange to exercise its Rule 814 authority to surveil ESPtraining through routine post-trade monitoring, program trading reports,revamped Form 81s, intermarket surveillance, its surveillance agreementwith the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Exchange's own frontrunningcircular. The Exchange should be able to monitor and police derivativeactivity relating to ESP trading and program trading, as well as questionabletransactions that may relate to customer conflicts of interest. Finally,the Commission believes that the Exchange should use its existing proceduresto discipline members and member organizations that abuse their fiduciarypositions and informational advantages to the detriment of customers andthe public interest. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion. </ITAG>The Commission believes that the ESP market structure balances appropriatelythe competing concerns of various Exchange constituencies in a manner consistentwith just and equitable principles of trade. Given the institutional characterof stock portfolio trading that ESP trading is designed to capture, theCommission agrees that the Exchange's chosen market structure, which accordsinstitutions strict price-time priority, is a fair and competitive marketstructure. Finally, the Commission's section 19 authority and the Rule19b-4 process allow the Commission and the Exchange sufficient flexibilityto modify ESP trading in light of actual trading experience and any futuredevelopments that materially affect the ESP market structure.\101\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\101\ The Commission believes that the 30 day comment periodthat accompanied publication of the Exchange's proposal and the Commission'scontinued willingness to entertain all comments that precede its actionas providing an adequate public forum to vet all the issues and concernsthat may have accompanied the ESP proposal. Accordingly, it is unnecessaryto hold public hearings on the NYSE proposal. Accordingly, based upon the aformentioned factors, the Commission findsthat the Exchange's proposed rule change relating to the trading of ESPstock baskets is properly within its jurisdiction and consistent with therequirements of sections 6(b)(4) and (5) and the rules and regulationsthereunder.\102\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\102\ The Commission notes that approval of the proposed rulechange is based upon a determination that the terms of ESP basket tradingare consistent with the requirements of the Act. If the terms of the ESPbasket market structure, including the index multiplier, are changed inany material way, however, it would be necessary for the NYSE to submita proposed rule change to the Commission in order to afford the publican opportunity to review the proposed modification and for the Commissionto review its prior determination. The Commission finds good cause for approving those portions of the NYSE'sproposal that were amended by Amendments 1, 2, and 3 prior to the thirtiethday after the date of publication of the amendments in the<T4> Federal Register.</T4> The original filing was the subject of a 35-daynotice period that generated several comment letters. The amendments madeonly minimal changes to the proposal as noticed. In addition, acceleratedapproval is necessary because ESP trading is scheduled to begin on October26, 1989. Because of the Commission view of the benefits that may resultfrom the trading of a basket of stocks on a national securities exchange,the Commission believes a good cause finding is justified. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and argumentsconcerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should filesix copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission,all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposedrule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communicationsrelating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person,other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance withthe provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copyingin the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington,DC.
