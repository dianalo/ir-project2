And this summer is a perfect time to go see it, for it has been substantially enriched by two high-quality temporary exhibitions connected with Mr. and Mrs. Walter H. Annenberg.    The first of these is a loan exhibition of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings from the Annenbergs' collection itself; the second is a show of two Cezanne sketchbooks that the Annenbergs recently gave to the museum.    The paintings collection includes works by most of the major impressionist and post-impressionist artists, including Degas, Manet, Monet, Renoir, Seurat, Gauguin, van Gogh and Cezanne. Many of the pictures are of very fine quality and some are among the real masterpieces of the period. The taste behind this collection is, however, a very particular one. Although impressionist painting is frequently associated with ingratiating images of lyrical sweetness, the Annenberg collection is marked by a certain austerity of taste. Some of the best pictures here are among the toughest or most untypical by the artists who painted them.    Monet's &quot;The Bench&quot; (1873) is both eccentric and tough, surprisingly dramatic and tense. A woman seated on a garden bench looks out at us, confused, it seems, by something. Just behind her, a man in a top hat leans insinuatingly forward, his left hand casually breaching the fencelike back of the bench. Standing at the far end of the garden, a woman with a parasol seems to observe the encounter unnoticed. Monet has bathed the scene in brilliant sunlight accented with bright red geraniums, giving it the full, ripe open-air impressionist feel -- at first glance. Yet the more you look at the picture, the more disturbing it becomes, and the more the idyllic setting seems to act as a foil for the mysterious and unsettling human drama that is being acted out in it.    While the other five Monets lack this edge, they are all beautifully painted, especially the exquisite &quot;Camille Monet in the Garden at Argenteuil&quot; (1876), with its remarkably rendered warm sun and cool shadows.    The Annenberg Renoirs are less exciting. The large &quot;Daughters of Catulle Mendes&quot; (1888), a portrait of young girls around a piano, is unevenly painted -- the wooden floor looks as if it is made of bird feathers -- and somewhat mawkish. The little &quot;Nini in the Garden&quot; (1875-76), though pretty, is slight, and suffers a bit from the proximity of the strong Monets.    Manet's &quot;Madame Manet at Bellevue&quot; (1880), an enigmatic portrait in which the sitter's hat covers her eyes, is a remarkable exercise in bravura brushwork. Among the three pictures by Degas, &quot;At the Milliner's&quot; (1881) is particularly haunting. And of the four fine Gauguins, it is the haunting double portrait of a gaunt Polynesian mother and her subdued but sensual grown daughter that stops you in your tracks.    The single most spectacular painting in the collection is probably van Gogh's &quot;Woman Rocking a Cradle&quot; (1889), one of five versions that the artist did of the same theme, and arguably the most powerful of them. In all of these paintings, Augustine Roulin, the wife of the only close friend van Gogh made in Arles, sits in front of floral wallpaper, holding a rope that's meant to rock a cradle. Although we do not see the cradle, the umbilical rope and the intense pattern of lush blooms almost assail the eye with their forceful and rhythmic message of motherhood and fertility. The colors in this painting, especially the blazing contrasts of reds and greens, reinforce its remarkable intensity. (Upstairs, in the museum's permanent collection, is a companion piece, van Gogh's predominantly yellow portrait of Mrs. Roulin with the baby.)    The other van Goghs in the collection are also very strong. These include two powerfully agitated renderings of olive groves, a spectacularly ethereal depiction of a vase of white roses, and a relatively early (circa 1886) flower painting, awkward but intense, that shows van Gogh just as he was developing his mature style.    To my mind, however, the most absorbing body of work here is by Cezanne. The Cezannes run in date from the striking early portrait of the artist's uncle Dominique as a Dominican monk, painted around 1866, to a handful of powerful late works. The level of quality -- with the exception of a dreary watercolor of Mont Sainte-Victoire that hardly looks like it was done by Cezanne -- is also exceptional. These include a panoramic late oil of Mont Sainte-Victoire (that holds up well even to Cezanne's celebrated rendering of the same subject, which is in the museum's own collection), an astonishingly lush and translucent watercolor of a still life with a watermelon and pomegranates, and an austerely geometrical depiction of a seated peasant.    But even more impressive than these, I think, is the extraordinary landscape painting called &quot;The House with Cracked Walls&quot; (1892-94). In this picture of a decaying house perched on an outcropping of rock, Cezanne has created a rich metaphor for the passage of time. The intricate geometry of the rocks seems to evoke the geological history of the very earth the house stands on. Particularly remarkable is the way the large cracks in the house are echoed by the tree trunks that stand next to it, drawing an exact parallel between the forces of growth and decay.    The two Cezanne sketchbooks show the artist in a more informal light, of course, but this is a wonderful opportunity to see his restless hand and mind at work. Now he takes a pencil and makes a small sketch of a pair of scissors; now he captures his son asleep. There are also studies for painting compositions, sketches done from paintings and sculptures in the Louvre, and some unusual Paris cityscapes. There is hardly a single sheet here, no matter how slight, that is not a pleasure to look at.    Both exhibitions are accompanied by informative, well-illustrated catalogs and both close Sept. 17. After that, the paintings will be returned to the Annenbergs until next summer, when they will be on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Plans have also been made for subsequent showings at the Los Angeles County Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. This is a major collection, which, it is rumored, will eventually be given to a major museum -- and a number of museums will no doubt be making a strong case for it in the months to come. In this exhibition, the Philadelphia Museum has made its own case very well. </TEXT></DOC>
