Shultz openedwide-ranging talks Monday in which he intends to confront visitingSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze about massive Sovietarms shipments to Central America.   They met for 90 minutes to set their agenda for the next twodays. Also, Shevardnadze told reporters, he had ``a very generalreview of the international situation'' with Shultz.   The dispute over Central America appeared unlikely to spoilprogress in efforts to reduce U.S. and Soviet nuclear arms orpreparations for the next superpower summit meeting in Moscow.   Shevardnadze was expected to offer a late-May summit date and tohave it accepted by President Reagan after they meet Wednesday atthe White House.   The Soviet foreign minister called his first session with Shultz``organizational.'' Asked if a date for the summit would be setduring his visit, Shevardnadze said, ``I think so.''   A treaty to slash U.S. and Soviet armories of long-range nucleararms by 30 percent to 50 percent is the projected centerpiece ofReagan's fourth meeting with General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   While Shultz said Sunday the agreement was not yet ``in thebag,'' U.S. and Soviet experts will try to square drafts of theirtreaty proposals during Shevardnadze's three-day visit.   But the wars in Nicaragua and Afghanistan cast a cloud on thepre-summit preprarations.   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway and StateDepartment spokesman Charles E. Redman accused Moscow of anunceasing supply of weapons to the leftist government in Nicaragua.   Apparently referring also to the reported supply of Sovietrifles and other arms to embattled Panamanian strongman ManuelAntonio Noriega from Cuba, Ms. Ridgway said: ``What we need now isan end to the continued Soviet provision of these high levels ofmilitary equipment.''   Redman, meanwhile, accused the Soviets of shipping more than3,000 tons of equipment to Nicaragua in January and February alone.   For a number of years, the Soviets have supplied Nicaragua with$500 million to $600 million in assistance annually, he said. ``Icertainly don't see it as an issue heating up,'' Redman said, butSoviet military support is a ``continuing cause for concern.''   In Afghanistan, meanwhile, the United States has been armingrebels fighting a Marxist government backed by an estimated 120,000Soviet troops and weapons.   The United States is demanding the Soviets withdraw the troopsand also end the aid. Negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistanreached an impasse last week, but Shultz evidently was not preparedto seek a compromise solution with Shevardnadze.   ``They're the ones who got into Afghanistan and the ones whohave to figure out how they are going to get out,'' Ms. Ridgwaysaid.   Reagan, at a White House ceremony to sign an Afghanistan Dayproclamation approved by Congress, said:   ``We may be approaching an historic moment. We all hope thatwhat we hear from Moscow means there will be a complete andirreversible withdrawal of all the Soviet forces from Afghanistan,that the Afghan people will be able to freely determine their ownfuture, and that the millions of refugees can return to their homeswith dignity.''   Shultz's first session with Shevardnadze dealt primarily withsetting an agenda for their talks on Tuesday and Wednesday. Theywill take up four main issues: arms control, human rights, regionaldisputes and U.S.-Soviet relations generally.   That is the traditional lineup for what has become monthlymeetings between Shultz and Shevardnadze, alternating betweenWashington and Moscow.   But in a novel break with tradition, instead of scheduling aformal dinner Tuesday night, Shultz arranged a buffet at the StateDepartment _ simultaneously with the showing in the Ben Franklinreception room of the movie, ``That's Entertainment.''   And Tuesday morning, a new ``risk-reduction'' center will beopened at the State Department to provide quicker communicationbetween the two capitals in order to avoid accidental nuclear war.   A formal agreement was signed here last September. A center isbeing established in Moscow, as well.   Satellite links will transmit information between the twocapitals, augmenting an existing telecommunications hotline.</TEXT></DOC>
