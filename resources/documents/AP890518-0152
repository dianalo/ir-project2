The statement by Mikhail S. Solomentsev, who was retired fromthe Politburo in September, was read at a regular briefing byForeign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev.   ``I believe it is my party and civic duty to state that theassertions by the investigators of the U.S.S.R. ProcuratorGeneral's Office are a brazen provocation, a vile and downrightbase lie,'' the statement said.   ``Never and under no circumstances had I given a pretext forsuch accusations.''   Before his retirement, Solomentsev was in charge of the PartyControl Commission, which disciplines party members who violaterules.   His statement followed by two days a denial by Politburo memberYegor K. Ligachev, who has been considered a conservativecounterweight to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a potentialrival.   Perfiliev also read Ligachev's statement, which previously hadbeen distributed by Novosti news agency.   Solomentsev and Ligachev were reacting to statements made bycriminal investigators Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov, who arefamous throughout the Soviet Union for their probe into corruptionin Uzbekistan.   Both Ligachev and Solomentsev said they demanded aninvestigation of the charges, and that the results be published.   Gdlyan was elected to the new Congress of People's Deputiesparliament in March with about 87 percent of the vote in a Moscowregion.   On Sunday, two days after mentioning Ligachev and Solomentsev inconnection with the continuing investigation, Ivanov won 61 percentof the vote in a race among more than two dozen candidates inLeningrad.</TEXT></DOC>
