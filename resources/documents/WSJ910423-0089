The pact, announced here Monday, shows the growingpressure for companies to share the rapidly escalating costsof staying in the chip business.</LP><TEXT>   It also underscores that the U.S., more and more, willlook to Japan for that help. ATandamp;T at the same time is one ofthe leading members of a U.S. government-industry consortiumestablished to ensure an independent, domestic base ofsemiconductor technology. While ATandamp;T officials insist theywon't share with NEC any of the know-how they get from thatgroup, called Sematech, they added that they don't expectthat Sematech can give them everything they need.   Original expectations by some proponents that Sematechcould develop purely American leading-edge process technologywere &quot;really unrealistic,&quot; said William J. Warwick, presidentof ATandamp;T's semiconductor unit. &quot;Sematech is not likely to be ayear ahead of the Japanese.&quot;   Meanwhile, U.S. and Japanese government officials arescheduled today to resume talks on a new agreement aimed atboosting U.S. chip sales in Japan. The two events aren'tentirely coincidental, as Japanese government and industryare trying to encourage more trans-Pacific alliances as a wayof reducing trade tensions.   Under the ATandamp;T-NEC pact, the two companies will worktogether to develop all the technologies needed to makesemiconductors two generations more advanced than those nowon the market. Those chips, which will begin to be producedin large quantities in 1995, will be able to pack 16 timesmore information on a chip than today's semiconductors,allowing full computer systems on one sliver of silicon. Onthose new chips, electric pulses will travel one-third of amicron -- one micron is 1/25,000 of an inch -- circuitry thatis half the size of the current state-of-the-art technology.The development cost of shrinking electronics to that levelcould be around $400 million, twice the cost of the previousgeneration.   ATandamp;T and NEC hope to reduce that bill by sharing researchand development in nearly 30 crucial &quot;process technologies.&quot;Each company will lead about half the projects, and will sendresearchers to work in the other's labs. The two companiesalso will share the patents for the work developed together.Both companies portrayed this as a marriage of equals givingeach other access to superior technologies.   The contract runs until January 1993, but executives ofboth companies said they will explore joint production,sharing other technologies, and working together in a similarway on even more sophisticated generations of semiconductors.   &quot;We have signed an agreement that demonstrates eachcompany's intent to develop a long-term cooperativerelationship in microelectronics,&quot; said Tomohiro Matsumura,NEC's executive vice president in charge of semiconductors.   All of that sounds like what some in the U.S. had hopedSematech would help spur among U.S. companies. ATandamp;T evenprovided Sematech with an earlier generation of many of thesame types of process technologies that ATandamp;T now plans towork on with NEC. But Mr. Warwick said that, while Sematechwould help revive the U.S. semicondcutor equipment industry,it couldn't help companies like ATandamp;T preserve leading-edgeproduction technologies. He added that ATandamp;T had searched invain for an American partner before settling on NEC.   &quot;We couldn't come together with any of the leading-edgeAmerican companies,&quot; said Mr. Warwick. &quot;They have a moreentrepreneurial focus which makes it more difficult for themto cooperate.&quot;   The new contract expands on a partnership formed by thetwo companies just less than a year ago in the rapidlygrowing field of customized chips. Mr. Warwick said thatagreement helped ATandamp;T enter a new field of semiconductors,and has helped boost significantly ATandamp;T's chip sales to NEC.   ATandamp;T also has an agreement with Mitsubishi Electric Co. tomanufacture and market certain memory chips, while sharingrelated technologies.   Several other U.S. and Japanese companies have formedalliances in recent years to share various stages of researchand production. Texas Instruments Inc. for example, startedshipping samples of the next generation of basic memory chipsin December after developing the design with Hitachi Ltd.   But all the previous alliances are limited to specifictypes of chips, while the ATandamp;T-NEC agreement coverstechnologies that can be used for the whole range ofsemiconductors the two companies make.   Agreement by other companies &quot;cover what vegetables youuse, this is how you cook,&quot; said David Hytha, head of ATandamp;T'sJapan semiconductor operations.</TEXT></DOC>
