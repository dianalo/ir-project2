This applies particularly to systems in which modern controland protection equipment is installed, since this guarantees maximumoperating reliability and availability of the generation and distributionplant. Even the most careful designs cannot completely exclude faultsin a utility's installations. Fault localization and recording of transientbehaviour provide potential for fast fault elimination, and thus enhancethe availability of the overall system. Fault analyses also contributeto the planning of preventive measures and so help to avoid damage toelectrical installations and machines.</TEXT></DOC>
