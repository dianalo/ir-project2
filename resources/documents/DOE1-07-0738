Nickel and other alloying element atoms were introduced intothe surface layers of zirconium by Ar ion mixing. The alloyed sampleswere oxidized in dry air or pure oxygen at temperatures ranging from400 deg C to 800 deg C. The oxidation kinetics, the structure and theelement concentration profiles in the surface layers were studied bymeans of NRA, AES and X-ray diffraction. The influence of doped atomson the stress in the lattice and the types of defects in the oxide layersare considered to be the main factors which produce the variations inthe oxidation kinetics.</TEXT></DOC>
