Group Discusses Options for Dealing with Global Warming</HEAD><DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.N. group on global warming completed workFriday on a list of possible actions countries could take tocontrol the emission of gases that cause the so-called greenhouseeffect.   The working group, which concluded a weeklong session Friday,did not make specific recommendations. It simply compiled a list ofoptions that it will submit to its parent body, theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is scheduled tomeet in February in Washington. The list was not released.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was establishedlast year by the U.N. Environment Program and the WorldMeteorological Organization.   The working group is one of three that are examining the problemof global warming caused by the greenhouse effect, with the aim ofeventually drafting an international convention on global warming.   According to the greenhouse theory, temperatures around theworld are slowly rising because of a buildup of gases that isallowing sunlight into the atmosphere but preventing heat fromescaping. Although the theory is widely accepted, scientists differover whether the greenhouse effect is causing global warming now orwhether that will happen sometime in the future.   The 43-nation working group discussed ``many of the options thatwould go into forming a framework agreement'' on global warming butdid not actually work on drafting a convention, the chairman, Dr.Frederick Bernthal of the United States, said at a news conference.   The three main gases thought to cause the greenhouse effect arecarbon dioxide, which is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels;methane, which comes from a variety of sources including leakagefrom coal mines and pipelines; and chloroflourocarbons, or CFCs,used in refrigeration and aerosol sprays.   A vice chairman of the group, Jiein Luo of China, said thatwhile emissions from industrialized countries have stabilized, itis ``unavoidable'' that those from developing countries willincrease. He said it is therefore necessary to ``protect theenvironment and climate on the one hand, but on the other hand notto hurt the development of these economies.''   Bernthal said financial assistance and technology transfers fromindustrialized countries to the developed world could help solvethe problem, but there is no clear estimate of how much money willbe needed.</TEXT></DOC>
