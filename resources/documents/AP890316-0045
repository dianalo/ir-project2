Border Plan</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Central American diplomats have reachedtentative agreement on a plan that would bring U.N. peacekeepingtroops into the region to monitor guerrilla movements.   The foreign ministers of Nicaragua, Salvador, Honduras, CostaRica and Guatemala are to meet March 29-30 in San Jose, the CostaRican capital, to adopt the plan.   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco of Nicaragua saidadoption would be ``a formality.'' Honduran Ambassador RobertoFlores Bermudez and U.N. officials also confirmed Wednesday'sagreement in principle.   Up to 11,000 Nicaraguan Contra rebels supported by the UnitedStates have bases in Honduras from which they launch raids intoNicaragua. They are the prime focus of the U.N. plan.   A U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thepeacekeeping plan does not conflict with President Bush's intentionto supply humanitarian aid to the Contras.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Tuesday that aninternational border patrol force was ``not inconsistent'' with theBush administration's policy goals.   The U.N. military observers are to operate in the region toverify reports of guerrilla activity and, by their presence, detersuch raids.   The United Nations has drafted a plan calling for up to 100military observers backed by 60 pilots, drivers and civilianadministrators from Canada, Spain and West Germany.   The peacekeepers are to focus on the Nicaragua-Honduras border tocheck allegations of raids by the Contras, and the ElSalvador-Honduras border, according to the draft proposal.   El Salvador says the leftist insurgents trying to overthrow ElSalvador's U.S.-supported government operate from secret bases inHonduras without that government's permission, and that Nicaraguasupplies the rebels.   The peacekeepers also are to monitor the Costa Rica-Nicaraguaborder, and will use speedboats to patrol the Gulf of Fonseca, whichlinks Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador on their Pacific coasts.</TEXT></DOC>
