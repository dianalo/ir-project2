Systolic computations are composed of simple systolic components,called atomic systolic computations. A nonprocedural language for specifyingatomic systolic computations is illustrated. Its associated translatorand runtime system are then discussed. Translation, focusing on the communicationissues of the systolic computation (i.e., interprocessor I/O and externalI/O), produces systolic modules (C programs) that can be compiled andexecuted. The goals of the SDEF project are threefold: 1) to offer systolicalgorithm researchers an executable notation; 2) to increase the productivityof developers producing reliable systolic application software; 3) tooffer the software systems community a notation (intermediate language)for higher-level systolic software tool development.</TEXT></DOC>
