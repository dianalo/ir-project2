But what -- if anything -- is to replace that policy?    Congressional Democrats, who are riled that White House officials apparently disobeyed legal restrictions against military aid to the Contras, talk about blocking future assistance. They say a cutoff is necessary to reassert Congress's foreign-policy perogatives.    As an alternative, most Democrats would like to revive stalled regional peace talks, but they concede it is impossible to force the Reagan administration to negotiate with Managua. In the next breath, they typically rebuke the ruling Sandinistas as untrustworthy Marxists.    Speaking of the post-scandal Nicaragua policy, Florida Rep. Dante Fascell, a Democrat and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, says: &quot;I don't know how this is going to work out.&quot;    While the Democrats equivocate, the administration is responding to the crisis by prescribing an escalation of the Contra war effort. This high-risk strategy threatens to leave the U.S. with a major Contra refugee problem unless the Democrats can be convinced to support future funding and give the Contras a chance to win.    Washington is pressing the Contras to move from their bases inside Honduras into Nicaragua, and thus take the offensive for the first time in years. U.S. officials are counting on the dubious assumption that with new weapons and training included in the recently approved $100 million aid package, the rebel force can make military headway against a Sandinista army several times its size.    Once the Contras begin to win battles and hold territory, so the hoped-for scenario goes, Congress will be faced with the proposition of pulling the plug on a promising anti-communist force. The Democrats, fearing they will be blamed in the 1988 elections for &quot;losing Nicaragua,&quot; would be forced to approve future Contra aid programs despite the Iran-Contra funds transfer.    &quot;The Democrats face the dilemma that the president has a veto over their alternative and vice versa,&quot; says William Leo-Grande, an American University political scientist and adviser to congressional Democrats. &quot;The most likely outcome is we end up with no policy, or rather a policy of hostility toward the Sandinistas in which we aren't able to overthrow them or negotiate with them. It's our Cuba policy of the 1960s all over again.&quot;    The need to avert a replica of Cuba in Nicaragua is about the only thing conservatives and liberals agree on when it comes to Central American affairs. Each side accuses the other of making that least-favored outcome more likely. Opponents of the current policy say the Contra war works in the Sandinistas' favor by giving them the excuse at home and abroad for their repressive policies and deepening ties to the Eastern bloc. Policy makers counterargue that military pressure is needed to reform -- if not overthrow -- the Managua regime and scare off the Soviets from meddling in Central America.    It will be difficult for either side to gain the upper hand soon. Congressional opponents have an opportunity to derail the policy by withholding the final $40 million of the $100 million aid package, which is scheduled for distribution to the Contras in February. But because Democrats doubt they can get a two-thirds majority to override a certain presidential veto of such a resolution, they are debating among themselves whether to fight at all. &quot;We may keep our powder dry&quot; for a vote later in the year against granting additional funding, an influential Democratic congressional aide says.    Contra leaders say they look forward to the military challenge. &quot;It's in our ballpark,&quot; says Carlos Ulvert, the Contra foreign secretary. He and other Contras assert that congressional stinginess until this year kept the Contras from picking up steam on the battlefield. Mr. Ulvert adds: &quot;If we're going to have 10,000 men in Nicaragua better trained and better supplied, their military presence is going to be felt.&quot;    Others, including supporters of the Contras, aren't so sure. &quot;Deep in my heart,&quot; says Georges A. Fauriol, a conservative scholar at Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International Studies, &quot;I find it hard to believe that the Contras can establish themselves well enough in the military domain to impress the international community and Congress.&quot; He predicts that Congress will respond to the scandal by putting new conditions and limitations on aid that will further throttle the Contra military effort.    Sam C. Sarkesian, a military analyst at Loyola University of Chicago, argues that the administration tactic of speeding up the infiltration of Contras into Nicaragua mistakenly exchanges the policy of slowly building up the counterrevolution for a war of attrition.    &quot;I don't know what you do with 15,000 (Contras) after the $100 million of aid,&quot; he says. &quot;Then what do you say after a year? 'I'm sorry'? This has shades of the Cuban Brigade at the Bay of Pigs.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
