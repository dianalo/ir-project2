In a five-page administrative complaint to be formallyfiled today with an administrative law judge, the commissionsaid the contract restricts competition in the marketing ofcollege football telecasts, reducing the selection of gamesfor consumers.</LP><TEXT>   The FTC action threatens the ABC network's lock on nearlyall nationally televised college football games. Earlier thisyear, the CFA and ABC signed a $215 million contract thatcommitted 63 of the association's 66 members to broadcasttheir football games on the network from 1991 to 1995. TheFTC could seek to have the contract voided and could prohibitany other agreements that restrict competition.   A lawyer familiar with the case said the FTC filing willresult in private negotiations between the agency and thedefendants. If no compromise is reached, the administrativelaw judge would rule on the complaint after a hearing inWashington Nov. 13. The defendants can appeal a ruling to thefull commission.   Lewis Engman, the Washington lawyer for CFA, said hisclient's broadcast arrangement doesn't restrain competition,noting that &quot;there are hundreds of football games availablenow&quot; on television. He said the CFA is &quot;confident thecommission ultimately will see that the contracts are goodfor viewers and competiton.&quot; Capital Cities/ABC officialscouldn't be reached for comment yesterday.   The FTC, in bringing charges against ABC Sports and theDenver-based College Football Association, essentially ispursuing an arrangement that has been in force since 1984,first between the CFA and CBS Inc., and now involving ABC.The FTC complaint isn't expected to affect CBS's broadcastsof CFA games this year.   In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NationalCollegiate Athletic Association had violated antitrust lawsby acting as the sole, mandatory negotiating agent for allcollege teams in the bargaining for television rights.   A spate of smaller contracts with various collegeconferences followed, with teams able to decide whether totake part in the television contracts. ABC made the most ofthe new pacts. ABC already has an exclusive arrangement withall teams in the Big Ten and Pacific 10 conferences and ABCadded the CFA contract in February, which gave the network amonopoly on nearly all nationally televised college games.The CFA consists of about 20 major independent universitiesand most of the major athletic conferences.   That monopoly was broken only by the surprise withdrawalof the University of Notre Dame, which signed its own, morelucrative television deal with General Electric Co.'s NBCnetwork.   The FTC refused to confirm or deny the plans for acomplaint, but said it will hold a news conference thismorning &quot;to announce a major antitrust action concerningcollege athletics.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
