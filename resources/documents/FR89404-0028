Chenok, President, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.<ITAG tagnum="84">Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Azcuenaga </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I dissent from the decision to accept for public comment the proposedconsent agreement with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.To the extent that this matter presents legally cognizable efficiency justificationsthat are unique to the accounting profession, the case breaks new ground.In addressing whether a violation of law has occurred, however, we haveexplored the theoretical costs of the challenged ethical rules far morerigorously than their benefits. It would be useful and responsible to devoteat least as much effort to understanding the value of longstanding tenetsof professionalism as to understanding their costs before changing thosetenets by fiat. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Analysis of ProposedConsent Order to Aid Public Comment </ITAG>The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, anagreement to a proposed consent order from the American Institute of CertifiedPublic Accountants (``AICPA''). The agreement would settle charges by theFederal Trade Commission that AICPA has violated section 5 of the FederalTrade Commission Act by restraining competition among certified publicaccountants (``CPAs'') in the United States. The Commission charged AICPAwith injuring consumers by unreasonably restricting CPAs' use of contingentfees and commissions for providing services to nonattest clients; referralfees; and truthful, nondeceptive advertising, solicitation and trade names.AICPA agreed to the proposed consent order for settlement purposes onlyand does not admit that it violated the law as alleged in the complaint.The Commission has placed the proposed consent order on the public recordfor sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Commentsreceived during this period will become part of the public record. Aftersixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and thecomments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreementor make final the agreement's proposed order. The Complaint The Commission has prepared a complaint to issue along with the proposedorder. The complaint alleges that AICPA is a voluntary association of almost264,000 CPAs, about three-quarters of the CPAs in the United States. ManyAICPA members are in the practice of public accounting and compete amongthemselves and with other CPAs. AICPA maintains and enforces a Code ofProfessional Conduct that it has used to restrain competition among CPAs.According to the complaint, AICPA has restricted the methods CPAs may useto set their fees. AICPA has prohibited CPAs from providing professionalservices on a contingent fee or commission basis to all persons, includingthose for whom a CPA is not also performing attest services. An attestservice, for purposes of the complaint, means any of the following: anaudit; a review of a financial statement; a compilation of a financialstatement when the CPA expects, or reasonably might expect, that a thirdparty will rely on the compilation and the CPA does not disclose a lackof independence; and an examination of prospective financial information.AICPA's contingent fee and commission restrictions have harmed consumersin various ways. For example, the contingent fee rule has prevented CPAsfrom agreeing to assist State governments to obtain Medicare refunds fromthe United States Government for no fee if the States receive no refunds.Moreover, the commission rule has prevented CPAs from assisting consumersby preparing financial plans and accepting payment in the form of commissionsonly when consumers buy financial products recommended by the CPA.The complaint further alleges that AICPA has restricted CPAs' use of truthful,nondeceptive advertising, including self-laudatory or comparative advertising,testimonial or endorsement advertising, and advertising that AICPA mayfind not professionally dignified or in good taste. For example, AICPA'sinterpretations of its advertising rules may have deterred CPAs from advertisingthat they are ``real tax experts,'' that they offer ``the expertise ofa large national firm,'' or that ``John Smith says that our firm was particularlyresponsive to his needs.'' According to the complaint, AICPA has also restricted CPAs from directlysoliciting potential clients and from paying referral fees. These restrictionsmay have prevented CPAs from soliciting clients by mail and paying marketingfirms to refer clients to them. Finally, the complaint alleges that AICPA has restricted CPAs' use of nondeceptivetrade names. For example, AICPA's rules may have prevented CPAs from usingtrade names such as ``Suburban Computer Services'' and ``Smith and Jones,CPAs, Tax Services'' even if such a name truthfully reflects services providedby the CPA. According to the complaint, AICPA has restrained competition among CPAsbased on price, quality, and other terms of service; deprived consumersof information about the availability, price, and quality of CPA services;and deprived consumers of the benefits of free and open competition amongCPAs. <T3>The Proposed Consent Order</T3> The proposed consent order prohibits AICPA from restricting CPAs from providingprofessional services for a contingent fee or a disclosed commission toany person for whom the CPA is not also performing an attest service. AICPAmay continue prohibiting members from using these methods of payment fora CPA's attest clients. The order prohibits AICPA from restricting CPAs' use of referral fees thatare disclosed. The proposed order prohibits AICPA from restricting advertising, solicitation,or the use of trade names by CPAs, unless AICPA reasonably believes suchactivities would be false or deceptive within the meaning of Section 5of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The order also prohibits AICPA from encouraging or assisting any associationof accountants to engage in any act that would violate the order if doneby AICPA. Finally, the proposed consent order requires AICPA to distribute a copyof the order and any revised ethics rules to AICPA personnel, AICPA members,and each state society of CPAs; publish the order in AICPA's ``Journalof Accountancy''; publish and distribute to AICPA personnel and membersrevised versions of AICPA's code, bylaws, interpretations, ethical rulings,or other policy statements or guidelines that comply with the order; andfile compliance reports. The purpose of this analysis is to aid public comment on the proposed order.It is not an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed orderand it does not modify in any way their terms.  <ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
