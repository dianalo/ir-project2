A majority of the 24,000 third-, seventh- and 11th graderstested by the National Assessment of Educational Progress knew whata joystick and a keyboard were, but most had little or no workingknowledge of computer functions or programs.   Despite the much-ballyhooed, decade-old ``classroom computerrevolution,'' most schools have yet to make effective use ofcomputers to teach reading, math or science, according to the82-page NAEP report entitled, ``Computer Competence: The FirstNational Assessment.''   Among 837 school computer coordinators surveyed, NAEP found 32percent of third-grade coordinators, 23 percent of seventh-gradecoordinators, and 10 percent of 11th grade coordinators did notfeel adequately prepared to teach computer science.   More than 90 percent of third graders and 86 percent of seventhgraders said they liked using computers, and more than half saidthey wished they used them more.   However, a majority said they lacked adequate access tocomputers at school or at home. The report also found schoolcurricula haven't changed to make effective use of computers, andmost teachers aren't adequately trained.   ``The difference is between knowing a little about the computer,and being able to use it effectively. Few American school childrencan do the latter,'' said Marc Tucker, president of the NationalCenter on Education and the Economy in Washington, who called theNAEP results ``disappointing.''   NAEP is a project established 19 years ago by the U.S. Congressto conduct national surveys of various educational skills. It isadministered by the Educational Testing Service in LawrenceTownship, N.J.   NAEP examined grade schoolers across the country during thespring of 1986. It used multiple choice questions to test studentknowledge about computers and to gather information about theirfeelings toward computers and how much exposure they have to them.   Among the report's findings:   _ White students scored 5 percent to 8 percent higher on averagethan blacks and Hispanics, mainly due to greater access tocomputers at home and in school. Boys also outperformed girlsslightly, private school students had an edge over publicschoolers, and Northeastern students knew more about computers thanthose in other regions.   _ Most third graders could identify the main parts of acomputer, such as the keyboard, floppy disk and joystick. Byseventh grade, nearly all could.   But only three out of ten 11th graders knew what an algorithm is(``a step by step process for solving a given type of problem.'')   Only 32.3 percent of third graders, 34.3 percent of seventhgraders, and 46 percent of 11th graders could correctly answer:``What is the main role of a computer program?'' (Answer: ``To tellthe computer what to do.'')   _ Except for word processing, students generally scored poorlyon questions dealing with computer applications _ making graphicsor working with databases, for example _ because students said theyhardly ever got a chance to practice.   _ More than eight of 10 seventh- and 11th-graders said theynever used computers to make a database, slightly over half saidthey never used them to write letters, stories or reports, androughly three-quarters said they never used them to make graphs.   _ Student knowledge of three common computer languages _ Logo,BASIC and Pascal _ was also found to be poor largely because onlyabout 10 percent of students said they had written computerprograms more than once a week. About two-thirds of those surveyedsaid they had never written computer programs.   The grim assessment suggests that schools have only dented theignorance most students and teachers have of computers despite thehuge purchases of equipment by many schools during the 1980s. In1980, 15 percent of elementary schools and 50 percent of highschools offered computer instruction. By 1985, 82 percent ofelementary schools and 93 percent of secondary schools did so.   ``Although some schools offer excellent computer curricula, manyother schools apparently do not provide effective instruction, atleast in computer applications and programming, to a largeproportion of pupils,'' the survey concluded.</TEXT></DOC>
