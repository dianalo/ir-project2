Trading was brisk on the New York Mercantile Exchange during asell-off that wiped away most of the gains achieved in the previoussession.   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, settled 43 cents lower at $19.99 a barrel. Thecontract had gone up 47 cents a barrel on Tuesday.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the Maycontract for unleaded gasoline slid by 3.03 cents to 66.43 cents agallon. The contract had risen by 1.61 cents and 0.88 cent onTuesday and Monday, respectively.   May wholesale home heating oil, which rose 0.89 cent Tuesday,fell 2.01 cents to 51.63 cents a gallon.   Jerry Samuels, an energy broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,said the selling came in response to reports stating that OPEClately has exceeded its crude production quota and that traffic andoutput in Alaska have returned to normal following the disruptionscaused by one of the world's worst oil spills.   ``It was a wild day. Several bearish elements sent the marketdown,'' Samuels said.   The price retreat occurred despite an industry report showing anuncommonly large drop in crude oil stocks during the latest week.The American Petroleum Institute said for the week ended March 31domestic crude oil stocks fell 12.8 million barrels to 324.58million.   Crude inventories have been drawn down due to delays inshipments from Alaska's oil fields while a cleanup operation takesplace.   It was reported Wednesday that flow through the Alaskan pipelinereturned to its normal daily level of 2.1 million barrels.   Oil flow from the North Slope had been cut by 60 percent becausethe spill restricted tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, but traffichas increased.   Energy prices have rallied recently, responding to the temporarysupply squeeze in the aftermath of a massive oil spill by an ExxonCorp. tanker at the Valdez, Alaska, port.   There was no confirmation of reports concerning the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries' crude oil output levels.</TEXT></DOC>
