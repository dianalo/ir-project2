(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The decision to relocate half thejournalists from the space shuttle press center by midnight beforelaunch was condemned as irrational and illogical Wednesday byreporters assigned to the Discovery liftoff.   ``The logic escapes me.'' said Kathy Sawyer of the WashingtonPost.   The Air Force, citing safety concerns in the aftermath of theChallenger disaster, is limiting the number of reporters at NASA'sComplex 39 press site to 1,800. More than 5,000 have applied forcredentials.   ``I don't understand the difference between having 4,000 hereand 1,800 here,'' said John Wilford of The New York Times. ``It'sjust a lousy situation.''   The Times and the Post, like all newspapers, were beingrestricted to two staffers at the press site until an hour afterlaunch. Sawyer said the limitation would make her work``logistically much more difficult,'' since facilities at theremote site are rudimentary.   Studies conducted by the Air Force in the wake of the Jan. 28,1986, Challenger accident and a Titan 34D explosion three monthslater have raised safety concerns about the press site 4.2 milesfrom launch pad 39B.   Reporters restricted from the main site will view the launchfrom a location about 6{ miles from the pad along the NASA Causeway.   The studies concern the patterns of falling debris from solidrockets should they malfunction just after launch and have to beblown up by a signal from the ground.   Jerry Hannifin, a Time magazine correspondent who has beencovering space launches from the beginning, has protested to theWhite House and NASA.   ``There are far greater dangers from mosquitoes that might becarrying yellow fever or malaria (at the secondary press site) thanfrom an exploding SRB (solid rocket booster),'' he said.   ``We're separated from our mission. It's ominous,'' Hannifinsaid. ``I've covered World War II, Korea, Southeast Asia. This isjust part of the business. It's our decision.''   ``I'm not convinced it's totally a matter of safety. I think themilitary would prefer to launch this stuff just as they launchTitans _ in secrecy.''   NASA is allowing its regular day shift, about 12,800 workers, tobe on duty.</TEXT></DOC>
