The forecast is slightly higher than the consensus of private economists, but it is far below the 3.5% forecast the administration issued last summer.    The downward revision reflects the stock market crash as well as the increase in interest rates and tightening of monetary policy since the last forecast, said Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors.    He said the administration's forecast assumes the Fed next year will allow the money supply, as defined by the central bank's M-2 measure, to expand within the Fed's stated target range of between 5% and 8%. If the Fed doesn't meet its target, Mr. Sprinkel said, &quot;that . . . will create problems.&quot;    The money supply has been growing at a 4% pace in the past 12 months. But recently released minutes from the November meeting of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee meeting show that the panel expected the money supply to grow at an annual rate of between 6% and 7% from September through December.    A spokesman for the Fed didn't have any response to Mr. Sprinkel's comments. He said that the Open Market Committee is scheduled to review its target for money supply growth in early February.    Although Mr. Sprinkel was careful to avoid directly criticizing the Fed, he is a monetarist who believes the Fed should provide for steady growth of the money supply. Some monetarists have been warning recently that Fed policy is too tight and threatens to produce an economic slowdown.    The administration's economic forecast was endorsed by Mr. Sprinkel, the secretary of the Treasury and the director of the Office of Management and Budget. It now becomes a key ingredient in the president's proposed federal budget for fiscal 1989, which begins next Oct. 1. That document is expected to be finished in early or mid-February.    Normally, budget writers prefer forecasts showing strong economic growth ahead because that implies the government will have a lot of revenue. Every 1% reduction in the projected growth of the gross national product, the value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S., trims expected federal revenue by nearly $6 billion a year.    Early in the Reagan years, the administration's forecasts were embarrassingly rosy. But lately they have been more in line with economists' expectations. According to Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an Arizona newsletter that tracks various forecasts, the consensus is that the economy will grow about 2% next year, although several prominent economists expect the economy to perform as well or even better than the administration does.    The administration's projected 2.4% growth rate, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988, is adjusted for inflation. The administration expects the inflation rate next year, as measured by the consumer price index, to be about 4.3%.    As do many other economists, the administration's team of economists expect consumer spending to be sluggish in 1988, largely because of the stock market crash. Mr. Sprinkel said growth in consumer spending next year will be less than the inflation-adjusted 2% increase expected for 1987.    On the plus side, however, the administration expects a surge in exports because the dollar has fallen on world markets. Mr. Sprinkel said 1% of the expected 2.4% growth is expected to come from an improvement in the U.S. trade deficit.    The administration also foresees a decline in interest rates. It predicts that the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds will average 8% next year, compared with 8.4% in 1987, and that the yield on three-month Treasury bills will average 5.3%, compared with 5.8% in 1987. The Blue Chip consensus expects the three-month rate at an average of 6% next year.    By projecting lower interest rates, the administration helps the OMB budget-writing team. A one percentage point reduction in interest rates saves the federal government about $6 billion a year.    Mr. Sprinkel said the administration expects the unemployment rate to average 5.8% next year, about the same as current levels.    The administration expects economic growth to rebound after the effects of the stock market crash wane. It forecasts a 3.5% growth rate for 1989 and 1990 and steadily falling interest rates and inflation rates. But forecasters, inside government and out, have a poor record in predicting economic trends that far in the future. </TEXT></DOC>
