The students have staged a sit-in on embassy grounds for a week,but said officials have offered no solution.   Today, they padlocked the embassy gates and barricaded them withtables, leaving Chinese staff standing bewildered outside.   One student said Zaire's military attache drove up in a car butthe students refused to let him in.   Theo Bitufuila, 26, who recently graduated from the ChineseTraditional Medicine College in Shanghai, said his governmentagreed to give students in China about $90 for monthly livingexpenses.   ``It hasn't paid in 23 months,'' he said, speaking through thecompound's iron gates. Zaire now has 89 students in China, mostpursuing undergraduate degrees in the sciences.   They have been living on about $67 a month paid by the Chinesegovernment, but many also have borrowed from their schools and areunder pressure to repay the debts, the students said.   Bitufuila and other recent graduates said their government alsohas failed to provide plane tickets home. ``The agreement is thatChina pays the tickets out and our government pays them back,'' hesaid.   Ambassador Lombo Lomangamanga, who met with students Saturday,refused to comment.   ``We have written letters for a long time now, not only to himbut to (the government in) Zaire, and there is no answer,'' saidManu Kapapa, 29, who just graduated from Shanghai's ChinaUniversity of Chemical Technology. Zairean students in othercountries also complain they have not received stipends.   The Zaireans are one of the largest groups out of 1,500 Africansstudying under Chinese scholarships this year.   Their presence has triggered racial conflicts in the past as inDecember, when African and Chinese students clashed in the easterncity of Nanjing after Africans brought Chinese women to a schooldance. Before the week of clashes ended, thousands of Chinesemarched through the streets shouting, ``Kill the black devils.''   Senegal sent its 18 students home, but students from Ghana andMali complained their governments would not let them leave.</TEXT></DOC>
