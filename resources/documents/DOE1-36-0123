<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0123 </DOCNO><TEXT>Advances in stress/strain measurement technology are recalled in a collectionof the author's previously published papers. Topics discussed includephotogrid determination of strain distribution, measurement of strainin the plastic range, the use of stainless steel in jet-aircraft structures,operating stresses in ship propellers, and dynamic-pressure measurementin a liquid-Na pipe using an electromechanical dilatometer. Considerationis given to bonded resistance strain gages for use on offshore oil platforms,power-plant vibration absorber systems, and residual-stress measurementin rapid-transit axles. Each paper is provided with a brief historical/autobiographicalintroduction. 65 references.</TEXT></DOC>
