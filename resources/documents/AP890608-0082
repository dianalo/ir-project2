At a hearing, Chief U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson said hewill rule Friday whether to combine criminal charges that accuseSecord of lying to Congress to cover up personal profits in theIran-Contra affair with 1988 allegations that Secord slipped illegalgifts to Oliver L. North.   Thomas Green, Secord's attorney, argued against bringing the twosets of charges together. He said one of nine counts brought inApril, obstruction of Congress, is ``incredibly broad'' and willresult in a lengthy battle over the use of classified material.Prosecutors have said they plan to introduce no classified materialif Secord is tried on the consolidated charges.   Green urged Robinson to try Secord separately on the gratuitiescharges relating to North, a step Green said would enable a trial inthe next month or so.   ``You wouldn't want that,'' the judge said.   ``I would love that,'' Green insisted.   Green said charges involving Secord's alleged lies to Congressdon't relate to the gratuities counts.   The judge said, however, that ``broad discretion'' is ``given totrial courts'' under federal rules that allow consolidation ofseparate indictments and that there doesn't need to be ``mechanicallinkage.''   At a previous hearing, Nov. 19 was mentioned by lawyers as apossible starting date for a trial on consolidated indictments.   The government is pressing to join the two sets of charges andplans to abandon wide-ranging conspiracy and theft counts accusingSecord of being involved in the diversion of Iran arms-sales profitsto the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   Because of the ``limited scope'' of the remaining charges, anyeffort by Secord to present classified material in his defense``will be a claim with very little likelihood of success,'' thegovernment said in court papers filed Wednesday.   Identical conspiracy and theft charges against North were droppedbecause of national security concerns. The government refuses todeclassify sensitive material that would have to be presented incourt in a trial of those charges.   Secord, who became an arms dealer after retiring as an Air Forcemajor general, is charged in a March 16, 1988 indictment withoffering and paying illegal gratuities to North.   In a separate indictment handed up in April, Secord is accused oflying to Congress about his alleged profits in the Iran-Contraaffair, which the government says were in excess of $1 million.   North, then a White House aide, enlisted Secord to run arms tothe Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to therebels. Secord also was accused in the April indictment of lyingwhen he denied that any money from a complex of overseas companiesknown as the Enterprise benefited North.   ``With the requested consolidation ... the government will offerno classified documents as exhibits'' in the prosecution's case, thegovernment said in court papers.   It said Willard Zucker, who moved money in the Iran-Contra affairfor Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim, will be theprincipal witness regarding the charges of lying to Congress.   Zucker, a former Internal Revenue Service lawyer now living inSwitzerland, will be ``a key witness'' for the government on thegratuities charges, the independent counsel's office said.   The gratuities charges involve a $13,800 home security system forNorth and a $200,000 fund set aside for the education of hischildren.   North was convicted last month of accepting the security systemfrom Secord, along with falsifying and destroying documents andaiding and abetting in the obstruction of Congress. He will besentenced June 23.</TEXT></DOC>
