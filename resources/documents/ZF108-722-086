Inc. (with its CDR-72) all have two 50-pin SCSIports for connecting to the Mac and other SCSI peripherals.andP;  The NEC CDR-35and the drives from Denon America Inc. offer only one 50-pin port, requiringthese drives to be last in the SCSI chain.andP;  The Procom Technology Inc. playercomes with two 25-pin SCSI ports.andM;Speed?andP;  All CD-ROM players available for the Mac are much slower than theslowest hard drives.andP;  Three of the drives we tested from Toshiba, CDTechnology and Procom are built around Toshiba's drive mechanism.andP;  Thesethree drives were the fastest of the group, although the AppleCD SC was onlyslightly slower.andP;  Both the Toshiba-based drives and the Apple drive weretypically twice as fast as the other drives we tested.andM;Our benchmarks (see below) measure data throughput when copying files from acompact disc.andP;  Because most CD-ROMs essentially are large storage bins, thistest reflects real-world use.andP;  The average access times of all CD-ROM drivesare slow, ranging from 350 to 1,500 milliseconds.andP;  This becomes especiallyapparent when they are used interactively and even more so in multi-usersituations that force the player to read non-contiguous sections of a disc.andM;Pioneer CD-ROM Changer DRM-600.andP;  The Pioneer drive is the first-everauto-changing CD player for the Mac.andP;  The disc-changing feature worked well,although there were delays of several seconds when switching between discs.andO;The drive was always much quicker than switching CDs by hand.andM;The Pioneer player mounts up to six discs on the desktop at the same time,allowing simultaneous access to files on more than one disc.andP;  Pioneer alsoprovides a &quot;jukebox&quot; HyperCard stack to play audio CDs.andP;  The stack allows youto select songs from six CDs for playback in any order.andP;  The player has RCAjacks for sound output to an amplifier.andM;Unfortunately, the Pioneer drive was the slowest of the drives we tested.andO;However, we found the multiple-disc feature very useful.andM;NEC CDR-35.andP;  The NEC CDR-35 has two unique features: an external set ofaudio-CD controls and a detachable audio unit.andP;  We found the external audiocontrols useful, since we could play audio CDs without using software orbeing connected to the Mac, but this is not exactly a productivity boon.andP;  TheCDR-35's speed was marginal.andM;The base unit has the smallest footprint of the drives we tested.andP;  The CDR-35is the only top-loading drive and also the only one that doesn't require acaddy.andP;  The player detaches from the power supply portion but does not workwith batteries.andP;  A 10.5-volt DC adapter must be purchased separately tooperate the player without the base power supply.andM;NEC also sells a battery for the base unit, making this drive truly portable.andO;The NEC CDR-35 and the CD Technology Porta-Drive are the only drives that canbe used with battery packs.andM;Toshiba XM-3201 A1-MAC.andP;  We found the Toshiba to be the most transportable ofthe drives.andP;  Although it is larger than the CDR-35 and the Porta-Drive, itdoes not require an external power supply.andP;  This unit looks and feels moresolid and dur-able than the two smaller drives.andM;None of the three Toshiba-based drives has RCA jacks to connect the player toan amplifier, and they all have three-position switches for volume.andP;  Thethree-position switches are annoying and do not offer the fine volume controlfound on the other drives.andM;CD Technology Porta-Drive.andP;  The CD Technology drive is the smallest of thefast Toshiba-based drives.andP;  The drive is powered by a large external powersupply, making the drive less portable than its name would suggest, althougha battery pack is available for $200.andP;  Like the other Toshiba-based drives,it has weak audio output capabilities.andM;Procom HiPerformance CD-ROM.andP;  This drive is the largest of the Toshiba-baseddrives.andP;  Its footprint is the same size as the AppleCD's, and the drive fitsnicely under a Mac SE.andP;  The Procom is the only one of the drives we tested touse 25-pin SCSI connectors.andP;  While the 25-pin connectors are non-standard,you can easily connect other SCSI devices with the standard 25-pin-to-50-pincable.andM;AppleCD SC.andP;  While it does not have any features that make it stand out inthe field of CD-ROM players, the AppleCD SC offers the basic necessities:reasonably fast access time and a volume knob for audio output from theheadphone jack and RCA jacks.andM;The AppleCD SC comes with a handy CD Remote desk accessory for playing audioCDs.andP;  The drive is also quick, offering performance only slightly worse thanthe Toshiba-based drives.andP;  The AppleCD SC is much faster than the NEC, OAI,Denon and Pioneer drives.andM;NEC CDR-72.andP;  The NEC CDR-72 is NEC's full-size CD offering.andP;  While notportable like the CDR-35, it is a faster drive with two SCSI ports and RCAjacks.andP;  This drive is a no-frills player, and while not particularly fast, itworked fine in our tests.andP;  The drive has a footprint slightly smaller than acompact Mac.andM;Denon DRD-253.andP;  The Denon player is one of the slower drives we reviewed.andO;The drive does have both RCA jacks and a headphone jack for audio output, andit comes with an application for playing audio CDs.andP;  However, the music stopswhen you quit the application, so you must run it in the background to playmusic continuously.andP;  The Denon drive is the only drive to supply an internalspeaker for monitoring audio CDs.andP;  We found the speaker useful, although thesound quality is about as bad as that from a cheap transistor radio.andM;This drive, like the OAI drive, was oversize.andP;  The case is sturdy but takesup far more desk space than the smaller drives.andM;OAI Access CD.andP;  This drive uses a mechanism from Laser Magnetic StorageInternational Co.andP;  OAI is currently the only company to sell these drives tothe Mac market.andP;  Unfortunately, the mechanism is mounted in a 12.5-inch-widecase and is quite slow.andM;The LMSI mechanism uses a non-standard caddy that is difficult to open andconfusing to use.andP;  The caddy is a poorly designed, two-piece contraption withone piece holding the disc, while the other acts as a protective cover.andM;Conclusions.andP;  All the CD players we reviewed are acceptable for occasionaluse.andP;  Certain drives, such as the Pioneer and the NEC CDR-35, have featuresthat made them stand out from the crowd.andP;  Unfortunately, the CDR-35 and thePioneer drive both were quite slow.andP;  The six-disc capability of the Pioneerdrive is an excellent feature.andP;  If you want to access more than one CD at atime, the Pioneer drive is your only choice.andM;We would have liked to have seen a drive with a fast mechanism, two 50-pinSCSI ports, high-quality audio software, RCA jacks and an external set ofcontrols for audio CD access.andP;  Even the best drives compromised on some ofthese features.andP;  The AppleCD SC came closest to our ideal drive.andM;We recommend the Toshiba XM-3201 A1-MAC, CD Technology Porta-Drive, theProcom HiPerformance CD and AppleCD SC for speed.andP;  Although their audiocapabilities were lacking, these drives were the top performers in ourbenchmarks.andP;  The Denon and OAI drives are bulky, slow and not recommended.andM;We tested nine CD-ROM players for the Mac, and while none of the drivescombined all the features we wanted, the drives were all acceptable.andP;  Speedis an important factor in choosing a CD-ROM player, but all are slow --  muchslower than hard drives.andP;  The CD Technology Porta-Drive, Procom HiPerformanceCD, Toshiba XM-3201 A1-MAC and the AppleCD SC were much faster than the otherfive players.andP;  The AppleCD SC offered a good mix of features and performance,but for pure speed, the CD Technology, Procom and Toshiba drives were better.andM;Of the five slower CD players, the NEC CDR-35 and the Pioneer DRM-600 hadunique traits.andP;  The CDR-35 is compact, is the smallest of the units wetested, and has a set of external audio CD controls.andP;  It's also the leastexpensive by a margin of more than $200.andP;  The Pioneer drive has a six-discmagazine and can load six CDs on the desktop at the same time.andM;The NEC CDR-35 and the CD Technology Porta-Drive can both run off of optionalexternal battery packs.andP;  The OAI and Denon drives, while functional, wereoversize units with slow access times.andM;AppleandM;AppleCD SC: $899andM;20525 Mariani Ave., Cupertino, Calif.andP;  95014; (408) 996-1010andM;CD Technology Inc.andM;Porta-Drive: $895andM;708 Montague Expressway, Suite 407, San Jose, Calif.andP;
