Smith, of Rockville, Md., said the blacks expressed their concernthat Bush has yet to name a black to one a high-level job.   ``Obviously that concern did come up,'' Smith said. ``Hisresponse was that we will over the term be pleased. He did not makeany specific commitments as to numbers and individuals.''   The session between Bush and his GOP supporters was friendly andwithout rancor, members of the group said.   Arthur Fletcher, a businessman from Washington and a formerofficial in the Nixon and Ford administrations, said ``one of thetragedies of the moment right now'' is that the Bush people wouldhave to ``look all over the place'' to find qualified blackRepublicans for good jobs.   The GOP, he said, needs to lure more blacks into the fold.   Bush told the blacks that he meant what he said about ``wantingto be a president for all the people,'' and he promised to carry outhis campaign pledge to ``speak out against the remaining vestiges ofprejudice and bigotry and whatever.''   Bush told the group about his telephone call to Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev earlier in the day in which he offeredcondolences for the ``horrible disaster situation'' caused by anearthquake in Soviet Armenia.   The ``very good meeting'' between Bush, President Reagan andGorbachev in New York on Wednesday was marred only by theearthquake, Bush said. The disaster ``put a cloud and a damper onthe visit at the end,'' he said. Gorbachev cut short his trip to theUnited States to return to the Soviet Union.   Reagan and other U.S. officials offered U.S. aid, if needed, andBush said the ``American people will want to hold out their hands tothose families who lost loved ones.''   ``Nobody really knows the numbers of people killed, but I had anopportunity to tell him how strongly Barbara and I feel in humanterms about that loss,'' Bush said.   The blacks gave Bush a standing ovation as he entered the roomwhere they had been engaged in a question-and-answer session withVice President-elect Dan Quayle. Also attending the meeting was LeeAtwater, whom Bush has recommended as the next chairman of theRepublican National Committee.   Spokeswoman Sheila Tate said Bush would be ``soliciting theadvice from black leaders on people to serve in all levels ofgovernment.'' On Friday, the vice president will meet with BenjaminHooks, head of the NAACP.   In advance of Thursday's meeting, Les Range, a black businessmanfrom Jackson, Miss., said he was disappointed no blacks had beentapped so far.   ``I want to make sure there are blacks in the Cabinet,'' Rangesaid. ``But the way things are shaping up, there's not much left.''   Bush has made almost a dozen high-level appointments, includingnine that have Cabinet status. Among those selected are one woman,Carla Hills, named as the U.S. trade representative, and oneHispanic, holdover Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos.   If no blacks are placed at the head of Cabinet agencies, Rangesaid, he will urge Bush to name them to sub-Cabinet-level jobs.Bush, he said, is ``sensitive to the needs of minorities.''   Several blacks have been mentioned for visible jobs in the newadministration. For instance, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, president ofthe Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, is under considerationfor secretary of health and human services.   Sullivan said he has told Bush transition aides that he wasinterested in the No. 1 job at that department but not in the secondjob.   Robert Woodson, a black businessman from North Carolina, is alsoin the running for secretary of housing and urban development. Butthe leading prospect seems to be Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.   Alan Keyes, a former State Department official who ranunsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Maryland this year, wasthought to have a shot at becoming U.N. ambassador. Instead, thatposition was given to Thomas Pickering, a career diplomat who hasserved as ambassador in El Salvador, Israel, Nigeria and Jordan.   Pickering played a minor role in the Iran-Contra affair while hewas in El Salvador. He testified before Congress that he hadassisted in arranging a secret donation of more than $1 million tothe Nicaraguan Contras at the time the United States was prohiitedfrom aiding the rebels.   Tate dismissed questions about Pickering's role. ``All of thequestions that have been raised have been reviewed. ... There isnothing remotely illegal,'' she said.   Bush, his voice hoarse because of a cold, made his comments onthe Armenian earthquake at a picture-taking session for theunveiling of the inaugural license plate. He attached the red, whiteand blue plate with the No. 1 on it to his black limousine.</TEXT></DOC>
