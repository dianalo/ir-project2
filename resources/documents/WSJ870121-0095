All this firepower is aimed not at a Ralph Nader-style corporate regulator but at a small data-collection office the General Accounting Office thinks Congress should set up. Moreover, there's some support for the idea inside the Reagan administration, including some offices at the Pentagon.    The current budget squeeze, coupled with the Pentagon's refusal to drop any of its new weapons projects, translates into big pressures on the companies' profit margins. Fearing a future with many arms programs to work on but stingy returns, contractors fret that they may be entering an era of &quot;profitless prosperity.&quot;    The problem is that while the Pentagon and the Congress are both determined to adjust contractor profits, neither can say just what the complex industry's profits are today. Within the Pentagon, accountants have been bickering for two years over whether the defense industry has reaped a windfall from the Reagan military buildup. The new office is designed to fill the information gap.    &quot;I can't remember an issue where the industry's been so agitated,&quot; says one aerospace lobbyist. Officials fear that after gathering data on contractor profits, the new agency would make recommendations on how to regulate profits and that these would eventually be codified by rules or laws. &quot;It looks like the last step toward turning the industry into a public utility,&quot; says David Smith, defense analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc.    &quot;The basic fact is that the Defense Department doesn't collect complete data on profits,&quot; says Richard Kaufman, general counsel to the Joint Economic Committee. &quot;That leaves Congress in a blind position.&quot;    Over the past two years, the Defense Department has generated confusing reports on whether the industry was ripping off the Pentagon during the Reagan military buildup. A report issued by the Office of the Secretary of Defense concluded that contractors earned &quot;equitable&quot; profits, but suggested that tougher negotiating policies were needed.    A subsequent report by the Navy charged that this study was &quot;methodologically wrong,&quot; and that it understated the industry's profits. According to the Navy, companies' profits on defense work were 15% to 20% higher than on commercial work. Moreover, the Navy study showed that many companies depended on weapons jobs to generate profits during periods when commercial activities weren't making money.    The GAO, a watchdog agency of Congress, then conducted a study that came closer to the Navy's conclusions. But a defense-industry group did a study that tended to support the original Defense Department report. &quot;There's no agreement on how to measure profits,&quot; says Earle Williams, chief executive of BDM Corp., a McLean, Va., technical-services company. &quot;The numbers yield wildly varying results.&quot;    Since Pentagon officials don't agree on how to measure industry profits, they have trouble developing policies for setting profit levels in contracts. For example, a Pentagon rule designed to lower slightly contractors' profits in some cases actually had the consequence of raising them. The department revised the rules when it learned of this.    The proposed profits agency, which is being pushed by the GAO and is likely to become a pet project of Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.), would devise a new method for calculating contractors' profits, and would then require continual reports from the industry.    Some Pentagon officials say they'd welcome the data. &quot;If we had better information, we'd know how much fat there is,&quot; says a Navy contracting specialist. &quot;We've certainly been in the dark.&quot; However, the Defense Department formally opposes the plan, arguing in a letter to the GAO that Pentagon audits are adequate.    The agency would collect financial data on companies' commercial businesses as well as their defense work. Mr. Caffiaux charges that this is &quot;unwarranted government interference.&quot; Another lobbyist fighting the proposal likens it to a requirement &quot;to walk naked down Wall Street.&quot;    Industry officials also charge that the new agency wouldn't respect the confidentiality of corporate records. &quot;They'll just give it to Congress,&quot; one executive complains. &quot;That's a problem that can be easily resolved,&quot; the Joint Economic Committee's Mr. Kaufman says. &quot;This is done all the time.&quot;    What upsets many contractors is that the government wants information on both commercial and military work, which suggests some officials believe the two should be comparable. &quot;There should be no comparison,&quot; insists BDM's Mr. Williams.    He and other industry executives argue that higher profits are needed in the defense business to encourage companies to sink funds into researching the next generation of weapons.    Part of the industry's strategy for fighting the plan is to enlist the Pentagon in the lobbying struggle by arguing that the new agency would usurp the Defense Department's authority. Some industry officials are working to spark stronger Pentagon opposition from the newly installed undersecretary for acquisition polices, Richard Godwin. &quot;This is a manhood issue for Godwin,&quot; says one industry executive. &quot;Hopefully, he's going to come off the shelf.&quot;    However, the so-called &quot;acquisition czar&quot; isn't actively fighting the plan yet. And although the proposed agency would collect information from the industry, it wouldn't have the authority to do more than recommend policies.    Meanwhile, the Defense Department is reviewing its profit policies and might find the data useful. For example, the Pentagon has recently said it will base profits more on levels of capital investment that contractors make in defense-related plants and equipment than on costs, as in the past. A continual profits-monitoring system might make it easier to track the consequences of this and other changes.    ---              How Contractors Fare Under Reagan   Military aerospace profits measured as a return on sales                    1984     1983     1982     1981     1980 Boeing             10.7%    10.5%    11.0%    11.0%     7.3% General Dynamics   10.3     10.0      9.6      8.2      6.9 General Electric   13.7     11.7     11.1     11.1     10.5 Lockheed            8.2      7.9      8.1      8.8      7.6 Martin Marietta     7.8      8.0      7.0     N.A.
