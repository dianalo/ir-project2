In my Jan. 2 letter, I said the courtwould have admitted the tape into evidence. Mr. Kochcountered by pointing to Section 4506 of the New York CivilPractice Law and Rules, which provides that any communicationillegally recorded is inadmissible in a New York court.   As any law student should know, Mr. Koch is wrong. DespiteNew York's Section 4506, the &quot;Bonfire&quot; court was required toadmit the tape recording into evidence because it proved thedefendant innocent. Sherman McCoy has a constitutional rightto present evidence that would exonerate him. In Davis v.Alaska, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a defendant'sconstitutional right to present exculpatory evidence is&quot;paramount to the State's policy.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, as Mr. Koch would have found out had he done hislegal homework, New York courts have recognized that Section4506's prohibition against using illegally obtainedrecordings would not apply when it would stop a criminalcourt from learning the truth. In People v. McGrath, NewYork's highest court stated that before excluding taperecordings under Section 4506, a court should determinewhether the benefits of that law -- deterring people fromeavesdropping -- were outweighed by the &quot;detrimental impactupon the truth-finding process&quot; that would be caused byexcluding the evidence. Based on this ruling, the New YorkSupreme Court Appellate Division, in People v. Hughes, ruledthat Section 4506 does not prohibit use of illegally obtainedrecordings to show that a defendant who took the witnessstand is lying.   In my classes, doing one's homework requires more thanmerely reading statutes. It requires that students read theConstitution and relevant cases as well.   Alan M.
