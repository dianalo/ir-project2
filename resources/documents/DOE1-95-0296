This technique presents the base for description ofnuclear reactor as an antineutrino source and is capable to regard reactoroperating mode and temporal peculiarities of neutrino experiment procedures.Direct realization of the given technique is limited by the WWER-440reactor example. The calculation results of {nu}-spectra of /sup 235/U/subth/, /sup 239/Pu/sub th/, /sup 238/U/sub f/, /sup 241/Pu/sub th/ fissionproducts are presented in dependence on irradiation time. A special attentionis paid to short-lived nuclei and to the analysis of their role in formationof antineutrino spectrum of fission products. The obtained results areused for calculation of cross sections of antineutrino interaction withproton, deutron and electron. Approximation technique for calculationof irradiated fuel {nu} spectra with application of equilibrium {nu}spectra is considered.</TEXT></DOC>
