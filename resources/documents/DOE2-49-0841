<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-49-0841 </DOCNO><TEXT>An SiO{sub 2} poor rock from the Beitbridge region of the Central Limpopocontains cordierite, sapphirine, spinel, corundum [COR], biotite, gedrite,rutile [RU], ilmenite [IL: X/sub Fe/=.91] and plagioclase [X/sub An/=.92]. BI, GD and COR appear to be primary phases from which the otherswere derived. SA and CD occur as discrete grains and as symplectiticintergrowths. Spinel occurs as porphyroblasts wholly within massive SA.Ru, Il and COR are intimately associated and generally occur within massiveSA. PLAG, mostly sericitized, occurs in border zones between symplectiteand CD. Phase equilibria involving GD-COR-SA suggest pressure in excessof 10 kbar at 800-850{sup 0}C. Nearly isothermal decompression resultedin the breakdown of kornerupine + COR to CD + SA symplectite at about6 kbar. The present study is consistent with earlier work of Harris andHolland that suggested the formation of CD-OPX in nearby rocks occurredat 4 kbar, 750{sup 0}C, and with the study of Windley et al. that inferredequilibration of associated kyanite-bearing rocks at 10 kbar, 800{sup0}C. Isothermal uplift, such as recorded here, has not been describedin many other areas and is difficult to explain. It may be explainedby tectonic thickening of the crust followed by rapid uplift and erosion,or by uplift of the lower crust as a result of extensional tectonics.</TEXT></DOC>
