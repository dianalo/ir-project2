(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four activists were arrestedtoday after they sealed themselves into an office at the BurroughsWellcome Inc. headquarters to protest the price of an AIDS drug.   ``We've been trying to deal with this company for two years,''said Peter Staley, one of the four men led in shackles from thebuilding 45 minutes after the takeover began.   The activists were charged with trespassing and damage toproperty.   The pharmaceutical company produces Retrovir, which costspatients or their insurers $8,000 to $10,000 a year, making it themost expensive drug ever marketed. Formerly known asazidothymidine, or AZT, the drug is the only U.S.government-approved medicine aimed at halting the virus that causesacquired immune deficiency syndrome.   The four protesters, who are scheduled for a May 4 courtappearance, are members of the New York-based AIDS Committee toUnleash Power, said Jay Blotcher, a spokesman for the group. Hesaid Staley, 28, is a former Wall Street bond trader who hasAIDS-related symptoms.   Staley, who said the activists were unarmed and non-violent,said they intended to maintain their takeover until their demandswere met.   ``We want a 25 percent reduction of the price of AZT,'' saidStaley. ``We want them to subsidize the government assistanceprogram on AZT.''   Burroughs Wellcome spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett said the protestwas ``misdirected because we have been trying for three years toget AIDS therapy to people suffering the disease.''   Dan Baker, another ACT-UP spokesman, said sheriff's deputies andBurroughs Wellcome guards broke down a non-permanent wall to get tothe activists, who had chained themselves to a door. He said hisgroup would pay for damages.   Baker claimed Burroughs Wellcome made an 80 percent profit onthe drug. Ms. Bartlett said Burroughs Wellcome had never releasedfigures on its profit and she didn't know where the 80 percentfigure came from.   Tests on AZT showed it can stop the AIDS virus from replicating,but does not cure patients. An estimated 8 percent of AIDS patientsbeing tested died while on the drug, compared with 40 percent whodied while taking a placebo during a nine-month test period.   The drug also increasingly is being prescribed for patients whotest positive for the human immunodeficiency virus but have notdeveloped any of the infections or cancers that kill AIDS patients.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control have estimated 1.5 millionAmericans are infected with the virus.</TEXT></DOC>
