Kaufman, (Office ofProtected Resources), 301-427-2319.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Before enactment of the amendments (Pub. L. 100-711)) to the Marine MammalProtection Act (MMPA) on November 23, 1988, the MMPA prohibited the takeof marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing unless authorized bya general incidental take permit or a small take exemption. Before a generalpermit could be issued, NOAA Fisheries was required to determine that thepopulation stock from which a marine mammal was to be taken was withinits optimum sustainable population (OSP) and that the marine mammal stockwould not be disadvantaged by the incidental take. If these determinationscould not be made because of the level of take that would occur or becausea marine mammal stock could not be determined to be within its OSP, nopermit could be issued for that particular marine mammal stock.On January 26, 1988, NOAA Fisheries announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 2069), its intention to prepare an EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) on the proposed reissuance of domestic general permits(other than the general permit for incidental take of porpoise in the easterntropical Pacific) that authorized commercial fishermen, primarily in westcoast waters, to take marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations.These general permits were scheduled to expire on December 31, 1988. Inaddition, two small take exemptions issued under section 101(a)(4) of theMMPA in 1984 were scheduled to expire on that date. Public scoping meetingswere held in Washington, DC (March 22, 1988) and San Francisco, CA (April8, 1988). In preparing the draft EIS, NOAA Fisheries determined that thereis insufficient information to determine whether most of the marine mammalstocks that interact with commercial fishing are within their OSP. Thissuggested that NOAA Fisheries would not be able to issue permits to authorizethe incidental take of certain marine mammal stocks.On February 16, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit in <T3>Kokechik Fishermen's Ass'n v. the Secretary of Commerce, </T3>839 F.2d.795 (D.C. Cir. 1988), issued a decision which further jeopardized NOAAFisheries' ability to issue any general incidental take permits or smalltake exemptions. The court upheld a District Court decision setting asidethe marine mannal incidental take permit issued in 1987 to the Japanesesalmon driftnet fishery (52 FR 19874). The majority concluded, as did thelower court, that NOAA Fisheries is not authorized by the MMPA to issuea permit allowing the incidental take of a marine mammal species that iswithin its OSP_in this instance Dall's porpoise_if the permitted activitywill also involve the occasional taking of other species of marine mammalsfor which no permit can be issued. As a result of the <T3>Kokechik </T3>decision and the fact that there is insufficient informationto determine whether most marine mammal stocks are within OSP levels, NOAAFisheries determined that some existing general permits or small take exemptionscould not be reissued and that some new authorizations could not be issuedfor foreign or domestic fishing operations within the U.S. Exclusive EconomicZone.On November 23, 1988, the President signed Pub. L. 100-711, reauthorizingand amending the MMPA. These amendments (section 114) replace existingprovisions for granting incidental take authority to commercial fishermenwith an interim exemption system valid until October 1, 1993. The primaryobjective of this new system is to provide a means to obtain reliable andaccurate information about interactions between commercial fishermen andmarine mammals while allowing commercial fishing operations to continuedespite NOAA Fisheries' inability to make necessary OSP findings. The informationcollected would be used to develop a long-term program to manage incidentaltakings of marine mammals associated with commercial fisheries. As a preliminarystep to establishing the exemption system, the amendments require the Secretaryof Commerce (Secreatary) to publish a list of fisheries along with thenumber of vessels or persons involved in each such fishery that have thefollowing:(I) A frequent incidental taking of marine mammals;(II) An occasional incidental taking of marine mammals; or(III) A remote likelihood of, or no known incidental taking of marine mammals.The Secretary is required to publish a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and provide an opportunity for comments on thisproposed list of fisheries within 60 days of the enactment of the MMPAamendments and to publish a final list within 120 days of the date of enactment.Changes to the list will be announced to the public through notice in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>; public comment will be solicited.In order to engage lawfully in fisheries in categories I and II, ownersof vessels must register with the Secretary to obtain an exemption to takemarine mammals incidentally, must display or possess physical evidenceof the exemption, and must submit periodic reports to NOAA Fisheries. Inaddition, vessels engaged in category I fisheries must take on board anatural resources observer if requested by the Secretary. Fishing in acategory I or II fishery without an exemption is a violation of the MMPAand owners and masters of comercial fishing vessels are subject to penaltiesunder this provision of the law. Owners of vessels in category III fisheriesare not required to register with the Secretary to obtain an exemptionbut they must report all lethal incidental takings.As long as the owner of a vessel complies with exemption requirements,he and his master and crew are exempt from penalties under the MMPA forincidental takings of marine mammals (other than the taking of Californiasea otters and the intentional lethal taking of Steller sea lions, cetaceans,or marine mammals from depleted stocks) in a fishery to which the exemptionapplies. The exemption system will be available only to U.S. vessels orforeign vessels that have valid fishing permits issued under section 204(b)of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Exemptions providedby section 114 are not available to vessels fishing in the yellowfin tunapurse seine fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific.The Secretary is required to establish verification programs to substantiatethe data submitted by fishermen. Verification will include education effortsregarding information to be reported, interviews with fishermen and otheractivities that will enable the Secretary to determine the reliability,the nature, type and extent of the incidental taking that occurs in a fishery.Observers will be placed on board vessels participating in a category Ifishery to monitor between 20 and 35 percent of the fishing operationsby vessels in the fishery. The Secretary may exempt vessels from observercoverage for certain reasons, such as protecting the health and safetyof the observer or ensuring the safe operation of the vessel. Observerswill be prohibited from bringing a civil action under any law of the UnitedStates for injury, illness, disability or death incurred during serviceas an observer against the vessel or vessel owner unless caused by thewillful misconduct of the vessel owner. This provision does not apply ifthe observer performs duties in service to the vessel. The Secretary shall establish alternative observation programs to obtainstatistically reliable information on category I fisheries for which therequired level of observer coverage cannot be met or for any other fisheryabout which reliable information is not otherwise available. The alternativeobservation programs can include, but are not limited to, direct observationof fishing activities from vessels, airplanes, or points on shore. If the Secretary finds that incidental takings are having an immediateand significant adverse effect on a marine mammal population or that morethan 1,350 Steller sea lions or 50 northern fur seals will be lethallytaken in one year, then he can issue emergency regulations to prevent,to the maximum extent practicable, further take. The Secretary must consultwith the appropriate regional Fishery Management Council or State beforetaking such action. If the Secretary finds that incidental takings arenot having an immediate and significant adverse impact but will likelyhave a significant adverse impact over a period of time longer than oneyear, then he must request a Fishery Management Council or State to takeactions that will mitigate the adverse impact. The Secretary also has generalauthority to impose conditions and restrictions on exemptions that he issues.The Secretary is also required to specify how catch data and other informationwill be reported and to establish an information management system to processand analyze data received from the verification programs and other sources.To protect the confidentiality of fishermen, the system will provide forpublic access to aggregated data only. Finally the amendments in this section require the Secretary, in consultationwith the Marine Mammal Commission, the States, the fishing industry, thegeneral public, the regional Fishery Management Councils, and other Federalagencies, to recommend to Congress by January 1, 1992, a proposed systemto govern the incidental taking of marine mammals after this section expires.<ITAG tagnum="84">Consultation With the Marine Mammal Commission</ITAG>As required by the amendments, NOAA Fisheries has consulted with the MarineMammal Commission on the development of the lists of fisheries. The Commissionwas provided a copy of the proposed lists of fisheries and rationale aspart of this consultation. Written comments and 3 reports discussing marinemammal/fisheries interactions were provided to NOAA Fisheries by the Commission.The Commission's letter has been made a part of the record and is availableupon request (see address). The reports, ``Workshop On Marine Mammal-FisheriesInteractions In The Northeastern Pacific'' [NTIS PB80-17544]; ``WorkshopOn Marine Mammal-Fisheries Interactions'' [NTIS PB82-189507]; and ``WorkshopOn Measures To Address Marine Mammal/Fisheries Interactions In California''[NTIS PB86-219060], are available from the U.S. Department of Commerce,National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161.The Commission recommended that several changes be made to the proposedlist of fisheries. NOAA Fisheries has decided not to make most of thesechanges at this time, but will consider these changes during the commentperiod. Therefore, public comment is specifically requested on the followingquotations from the Commission's letter on the categorization of variousfisheries:<ITAG tagnum="21">For the most part, the Commission has no information with which todisagree with the placement of fisheries into the three frequency categoriesproposed by the Service. However, there are a few instances in which wesuggest modifications to the list. Most notably, we believe that the salmongillnet fisheries * * * and the California gillnet fisheries for whitesea bass and other species * * * proposed for listing in category II shouldbe moved to category I. In making this suggestion, we note that these fisheriesare very similar to other gillnet fisheries proposed for inclusion in categoryI and, as they occur in areas in which marine mammals are known to occur,are reasonably likely to take marine mammals with a similar frequency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * drawing analogies between fisheries can be helpful in classifyingthose fisheries for which few incidental take data are available. The Commissionbelieves that the Service can and should use such analogies more than itapparently has in formulating the list. In particular, fisheries with potentiallysubstantial incidental take rates have been placed in cateogry II becausethere currently is insufficient documentary evidence from observation ofthat fishery to support a category I listing. We therefore recommend theaddition of a third criteria for listing under category I as follows: ``byanalogy with a fishery listed in category I, it is likely that a `frequent'take of marine mammals occurs.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * Recognizing that the incidental take of marine mammals withina fishery may be considerably higher in some locations or may be higherfor certain segments of a fishing season, the Commission is concerned aboutcategorizing fisheries based solely on fishery wide averages. The systemfor determining what constitutes a fishery or for classifying those fisheriesmust have enough flexibility to take into account such local or seasonalvariations. For instance, if vessels have a high probability of takingmarine mammals for one month of a six month season, the fishery shouldbe listed as a category I fishery for at least part of the year. Similarly,local concentrations of incidental takes should be reflected either inhow fisheries are listed or how they are classified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A further problem arises in the discussion of what constitutes ``frequent,''``occasional,'' and ``remote likelihood'' for purposes of categorizingfisheries. These definitions all are expressed in terms of the likelihoodof an observer on a representative vessel witnessing the incidental takeof a marine mammal during an ``observer stint.'' What constitutes an observerstint, however, is unclear. The Commission believes that the Service shouldadopt definitions based upon a more precise standard. We therefore recommendthat these terms be defined in terms of the likelihood of an individualvessel taking a marine mammal per fishing season or per year.</ITAG>NOAA Fisheries will continue consulting with the Commission on the listof fisheries and other matters pertaining to the exemption process.<ITAG tagnum="84">Schedule of Events</ITAG>NOAA Fisheries provides the following tentative schedule to implement theexemption provisions of section 114:<ITAG tagnum="15">March 23_(1) Day 120.

Tables 1, 2 and 3 describe west coast fisheries, whileTables 4, 5 and 6 describe the east coast fisheries, including the Gulfof Mexico. The proposed lists identify and categorize fisheries accordingto their levels of frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals. Timelycomments received on the proposed lists and categories will be consideredin compiling the final list to be published by March 23, 1989.Before completing these proposed lists, the agency held two public meetings,one in Seattle, WA, on December 16 and one in Washington, DC on December19, at which the public was invited to comment on how the list should bedeveloped. NOAA Fisheries also mailed a draft proposed list of fisheriesto States, Regional Fishery Management Councils, environmental groups,fishing industry representatives and other interested parties. Commentsreceived from these groups and during the public meetings were consideredto the extent time allowed.In compiling the proposed lists of fisheries, the agency was faced withtwo major tasks. First, it was necessary to identify all fisheries thatwould be eligible for the exemption provided by section 114. To ensurea sensible application of the provisions of the amendments, NOAA Fisheriesidentified commercial fisheries according to gear type, species of fishcaught, geographic distribution or some combination of these. In many instances,fisheries were identified according to groupings used by State agenciesfor management purposes. The list is meant to include all fisheries operatingin U.S. waters or under U.S. jurisdiction with the exception of Japanesesalmon gillnet fisheries and the eastern tropical Pacific yellowfin tunapurse seine fishery which were explicitly excluded from the exemption providedin section 114.The second major task was deciding in which of the three categories eachfishery should be placed based on the frequency of incidental takings.The amendments establish three categories according to whether there isfrequent incidental taking (category I), occasional incidental taking (categoryII) or a remote likelihood or no known incidental taking (category III).The Committee Reports (Senate Report 100-592 and House of Representatives100-970) accompanying the amendments recognize that for the first yearsection 114 is in effect, the Secretary may not have adequate data necessaryto determine accurately the placement of all fisheries into categories.Accordingly, these reports recommend six fisheries to be included in categoryI and two fisheries to be included in category III. NOAA Fisheries hasincluded these fisheries in the recommended categories for the proposedlist.To categorize all other fisheries, it was necessary to interpret and define``frequent,'' ``occasional,'' and ``remote likelihood.'' NOAA Fisheriesdecided to define these terms based more on qualitative standards thanquantitative ones due to the lack of reliable data documenting many commercialfishery interactions with marine mammals. NOAA Fisheries considered theCommittee Reports and comments from those involved in the development ofthe amendments, including Congressional staff. As a result, NOAA Fisheriesconcluded that ``frequent,'' ``occasional'' and ``remote likelihood'' wereintended by Congress to be evaluated on the average frequency with whichmarine mammals are taken incidentally in a fishery. This interpretationwould place observers on board vessels in fisheries where the likelihoodof observing interactions with marine mammals would be maximized.NOAA Fisheries therefore interprets Congressional intent to be that categorizationof fisheries should not be based on the status of stocks of marine mammalspecies or the likelihood of a significant adverse impact on a species.Other actions, such as mitigating measures, voluntary placement of observersand alternative observation programs, are available under the amendmentsto address situations where incidental take may not be frequent but commercialfishing may be adversely affecting a marine mammal population or wherethere are critical research needs.Using this interpretation, ``frequent'' is defined to mean that it is highlylikely that more than one incidental taking will be noted during a standardobservation period by an observer on a randomly selected vessel. ``Occasional''is defined to mean that there is some likelihood that an incidental takingwill be noted during a standard observation period by an observer on arandomly selected vessel, but that there is little likelihood that morethan one incidental taking will be noted during the standard observationperiod. And, ``remote likelihood'' is defined to mean that it is highlyunlikely that any incidental takings will be noted during a standard observationperiod by an observer on a randomly selected vessel.For purposes of categorizing fisheries, NOAA Fisheries considered incidentaltaking to mean accidental entanglement and serious injury or death, assuggested by Committee Reports, and intentional takings to protect gear,catch or person. Intentional takings are included because the amendmentsexpressly require vessels in category I and II fisheries to report suchtakings and because these takings are the primary type of taking in severalfisheries.These definitions were applied to categorize fisheries according to thefollowing guidelines. If sufficient documented information was availableto estimate the frequency of incidental takings of marine mammals, suchinformation was used in categorizing that fishery. If there was not sufficientdocumented information to estimate the frequency of incidental takings,the agency looked to other factors that would indicate the likelihood ofincidental takings such as gear types, fishing techniques, species fished,areas fished and duration of a fishing season. If these factors indicateda likelihood of at least occasional incidental takings, but the frequencycould not be estimated because of insufficient documented information,the fishery was placed in category II.If available information or other factors indicated that the likelihoodof incidental takings in a fishery would be so rare or exceptional as tobe remote or non-existent, that fishery was placed in category III.The definitions and criteria used in identifying and categorizing fisherieswill be incorporated into the notice to be published by March 23, 1989.The final list will be developed after considering comments received onthis proposed list. The final list will be subject to revision at leaston an annual basis during the five-year exemption period after notice andopportunity for public comment. NOAA Fisheries anticipates that as informationbecomes available, there will be a number of revisions made to the list.The following sections discuss the specific criteria for placing fisheriesin one of three categories designated by Congress.<ITAG tagnum="84">Category I Fisheries_Tables 1 and 4</ITAG>Tables 1 and 4 comprise the list of commercial fisheries conducted in U.S.waters that were considered to have frequent incidental takings of marinemammals. Fisheries were included in this list based on the following criteria:(1) Committee Reports recommended that the fishery be placed in categoryI; or,(2) There is sufficient documented information indicating a ``frequent''incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery.Category I Fisheries Indicated by Committee ReportThe Committee Report of the House of Representatives identified the PrinceWilliam Sound/Copper River set and drift gillnet fisheries, Unimak Passand False Pass (Alaska Peninsula) salmon drift gillnet fisheries, ColumbiaRiver salmon drift gillnet fisheries, the Washington and Oregon threshershark drift gillnet fishery, and the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska groundfishtrawl fisheries as Category I fisheries. The Senate Committee Report affirmedthe House of Representatives' list and added the Unimak Pass and FalsePass purse seine salmon fishery. Not all of these fisheries would qualifyas Category I fisheries under the second criterion above because thereis not sufficient documented information to estimate accurately the frequencyof incidental takings in all cases. However, NOAA Fisheries considers Congressionalintent to be adequate justification for placing them in Category I in theproposed list for purposes of soliciting comments. Moreover, most of thesefisheries were identified and jointly suggested to Congress by representativesof the environmental community and the fishing industry as category I fisheries.At the end of the first year, observer data should either verify or refutethe placing of these fisheries in category I. These fisheries are brieflydiscussed below in terms of available information concerning incidentaltakings. After considering all available information, timely comments received,and any other pertinent factors, NOAA Fisheries may decide to recategorizesome of these fisheries in the final list.Matkin and Fay (1980) reported that approximately 1,000 marine mammalswere entangled or killed in the Copper River Delta/Prince William Soundsalmon drift gillnet fishery during the 1978 season. The approximate compositionof the kill was 516 harbor seals, 333 northern sea lions, 10 Dall's porpoise,44 harbor porpoise and 66 sea otters. Unpublished data collected by Wynneindicate that the levels of interaction probably were of the same orderof magnitude in 1988.There is not sufficient information available to estimate reliably thefrequency of incidental takings in the Prince William Sound set gillnetfishery for salmon and the Alaska Peninsula (Unimak Pass and False Pass)drift gillnet fishery. However, northern sea lions, harbor seals and seaotters reside in the area and they are known to interact with similar gearin the Prince William Sound/Copper River drift gillnet fishery. Thereforethere is a high potential for the taking of northern sea lions, sea ottersand harbor seals in these fisheries.The results of monitoring programs for the salmon gillnet fisheries inthe Columbia River and adjacent waters were reported by Beach et al. (1985).Estimated harbor seal mortality in Grays Harbor, Willipa Bay and the ColumbiaRiver was 335 animals in 1980. In 1981, total mortality was projected forthe Columbia River at 335 harbor seals. California sea lion mortality inthe fishery ranged from 4 to 45 animals over the same period. In additioncommercial fishermen frequently harass mammals away from their nets. Someof these animals entangle in the nets and drown, and others are killedafter attempts to harass them away from fishing operations fail.Committee Reports identified the Washington and Oregon drift gillnet fisheryfor thresher shark as a Category I fishery. NOAA Fisheries believes thatthese reports identified only part of this fishery. The California driftnetthresher shark fishery represents the southern end of this fishery andshould be combined with the Washington/Oregon portion. Therefore, NOAAFisheries has added the California extension of this fishery to CategoryI. The thresher shark is a highly migratory species that occurs along theentire west coast. The majority of the thresher shark fleet originatesin California where they fish for swordfish as well as shark. The Washingtonand Oregon fishery is conducted largely by California fishermen who havefollowed the sharks north in the summer months. The drift gillnet fisheryfor thresher shark is a relatively young fishery that started around theChannel Islands in southern California in 1977. Miller et al. (1983) estimatedthat the fishery off of southern California killed between 600 and 1200California sea lions between September 1980 and September 1981. In 1983,the State of California promulgated regulations to reduce the incidentalmortality of California sea lions. As a result of the new regulations,and the 1983-84 El Nino event, the fishery moved offshore and extendedto the north and billfish became an important target species. Since thisshift, there have been too few observers placed to produce statisticallyreliable estimates of incidental marine mammal mortality. Diamond et al.(1987) reported that the redistribution of the fishing effort contributedto a reduction in the rate of California sea lion mortality but had movedthe fishery into areas where it interacts with more species of marine mammals.Between Diamond et al. (1987) and preliminary unpublished data from the1988 Washington and Oregon observer program, 15 different species of marinemammals have been observed taken in this fishery. Given the potential forthis fishery to take large numbers of marine mammals and the diversityof marine mammal species known to have been taken in the fishery, NOAAFisheries proposes that the entire west coast drift net fishery for threshershark and swordfish be placed in Category I.The Bering Sea/Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl fishery interacts with 14different species of marine mammals. Loughlin et al. (1983), Loughlin andNelson (1986), and unpublished observer reports prepared annually by theNOAA Fisheries National Marine Mammal Laboratory, indicate that most ofthese were taken in the foreign and joint venture fisheries. Loughlin andNelson (1986) estimated that 958 to 1,436 northern sea lions were killedin the Shelikof Strait fishery in 1982. However, mortalities decreasedsubstantially in following years and the fishery has become largely domesticin nature. Unpublished data from Craig (Alaska Department of Fish and Game)indicate a low level of interaction between the domestic trawl fleet andmarine mammals; only 4 northern sea lions were caught during 1,176 trawlhauls observed during the 1978 through 1988 seasons.Observer data in the North Pacific groundfish trawl fishery indicate thatthe degree of interaction with marine mammals varies widely according tothe time of year, location of the fishery, species of fish sought and thetype of trawl gear used. NOAA Fisheries is interested in defining thesesegments as precisely as possible. This will enable NOAA Fisheries to moreaccurately identify those segments with frequent interactions and to developappropriate mitigation measures, if necessary.Melteff and Rosenberg (1984) indicated ``frequent encounters'' occur betweenthe South Unimak (Unimak Pass and False Pass) salmon purse seine fisheryand marine mammals. During 1987, however, the fishery lasted only 110 hoursand reports submitted by Certificate of Inclusion holders and the Stateobserver program indicated that entangling, seriously injuring, or killinga marine mammal in this fishery is highly unlikely. Additional Category I Fisheries NOAA Fisheries propose to include the following west coast fisheries toCategory I: the Prince William Sound and Southern Bering Sea sablefishlongline fisheries; the Washington marine set gillnet fishery for salmonin areas 4, 4A, and 4B; and the California halibut and angel shark setgillnet fishery. Two east coast fisheries are proposed to be included inCategory I: the foreign mackerel trawl fishery and the Gulf of Marine gillnetfishery. These fisheries are being placed in Category I because ``frequent''incidental taking of marine mammals has been documented. Interactions between sablefish longline fisheries and killer whales inPrince William Sound have resulted in losses of fish reported to be ashigh as 25 percent of the catch. Similar sablefish/killer whale interactionsare known to occur in the Southern Bering Sea south of 57 degrees Northlatitude and east of 170 degrees West longitude as well. To deter thisdepredation of catch, fishermen intentionally harass the whales and ifharassment fails, some fishermen have attempted to kill the whales thatdepredate their catch. Such attempted killings are in violation of theMMPA. Dahlheim (1988) and unpublished studies by Matkin presume a mortality(based on the absence of known individuals) in Prince William Sound ofthree killer whales in 1985, three in 1986, one each in 1987 and 1988.Also, some mortalities are believed to have occurred in the Southern BeringSea sablefish longline fishery. The available evidence indicates frequentintentional takings of killer whales in this fishery. NOAA Fisheries proposes to include the Washington marine set gillnet fisheryfor salmon in Washington's Fisheries Management and Reporting Areas 4,4A, and 4B in Category I. Available information, based on reports and observations,indicates there is a frequent incidental taking of marine mammals in thisfishery. The California Department of Fish and Game has been monitoring set netfisheries in near shore waters since 1983. From 1983 through 1985, theestimated mortality of California sea lions was between 2,207 and 3,427annually and the estimated mortality of harbor seals increased from 834to 1,886 animals per year (Hanan, et al. 1988). The California halibutand angel shark fisheries account for most of this mortality. These fisheriesalso take common dolphins, harbor porpoise, sea otters (which would notbe authorized under the exemption system) and a small number of gray whales.Based on the high total number of documented takings and the number ofvessels in these fisheries, there is sufficient indication that these fisherieshave frequent incidental takings of marine mammals. In East coast fisheries, the foreign mackerel trawl fishery listed in Table4 is included as a category I fishery based on 100 percent observer coveragefrom 1984-88. During this period a total of 286 animals were killed atan observed rate of kill per day of 0.1 (or one every 10 days). The averageobserver trip was two weeks. This information documents a frequent incidentaltaking in this fishery. The Gulf of Maine gillnet fishery listed in Table 4 is also being placedin category I based on reports and observations documented in Gilbert andWynne (1987). This study documented that in one segment of the fisheryat least 100 marine mammals were incidentally taken by 11-22 vessels overa fishing season. This information indicates a frequent incidental takingof marine mammals in this fishery.<ITAG tagnum="84">Category II Fisheries_Tables 2 and 5</ITAG>Tables 2 and 5 comprise the list of fisheries that have an ``occasionalincidental take of marine mammals.'' No Category II fisheries were identifiedin Congressional Reports on the amendments. These fisheries were includedin this category based on the following criteria:(1) There is information indicating an ``occasional'' incidental takingof marine mammals in the fishery; or(2) In the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidentaltaking of marine mammals, there is a likelihood of at least an ``occasional''incidental taking in the fishery based on factors such as gear type, fishingtechniques, species fished, areas fished, or duration of fishing season.A brief discussion of these fisheries follows.Given the known incidence of marine mammals in the area, and that the salmongillnet fisheries listed in Table 2 use gear similar to the gear observedby Matkin and Fay (1980) in the Copper River Delta and by Beach et al.(1985) in the Columbia River, there is some likelihood of an occasionalincidental take of marine mammals. In addition there are reports indicatingthat incidental takes of marine mammals are more than a rare or exceptionalevent in most salmon gillnet fisheries. However, there is insufficientinformation to estimate reliably the frequency of the takes. Examples ofreports in various salmon gillnet fisheries are discussed below.The NOAA Fisheries Alaska Region documented six humpback whale entanglements,resulting in at least one mortality in the southeast Alaska drift gillnetfishery for salmon in 1987. This appears to be an anomalous year and maynot be a reliable estimate of the frequency of incidental takes.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Region has received reports that fishermen in theYakatat set gillnet fishery for salmon occasionally shoot northern sealions (the amendments do not provide an exemption for such takings) andharbor seals to prevent loss of catch or damage of gear. This fishery alsotook a gray whale in 1988.Twelve beluga whales were reported taken in 1983 in the Bristol Bay setand drift gillnet fisheries for salmon (Frost et al. 1984). But since fewother published reports of interactions with salmon gillnet fisheries inAlaska, Washington, or Oregon are available, this information does notconstitute sufficient justification to place this fishery in Category I.Certificate of Inclusion holders have reported incidental marine mammaltakes in the Puget Sound and Straits of Juan de Fuca salmon gillnet fisherybut these reports are not sufficient to estimate reliably the actual frequencyof incidental takings.The gillnet fisheries for California white sea bass, yellowtail, and soupfinshark were placed in Category II because the gear is similar to the gearused in other fisheries with frequent incidental takings and there is knownincidence of marine mammals in the areas fished. These fisheries use meshsizes large enough to capture California sea lions and harbor seals. Hananet al. (1988) estimated the total mortality of California sea lions andharbor seals in these fisheries to be small compared to the take in thehalibut and angel shark fisheries. The white croaker and bonito/flyingfish gillnets use smaller mesh but takes of marine mammals are reportedand there is some likelihood of occasional incidental takings.The salmon troll fisheries are included in Category II based on fishermenreports and the likelihood of at least an occasional intentional take toprotect gear or catch. The entanglement of marine mammals is a rare event,but the loss of hooked fish to seals and sea lions occurs on at least anoccasional basis. Fishermen use various methods, including firearms, todeter marine mammals from stealing hooked fish. When this type of deterrencehas failed, fishermen have been known to shoot at and sometimes kill animalsthat continue to depredate their catch. Based on interviews with fishermen,Miller et al. (1983) reported that approximately 300 California sea lionswere killed in the California salmon troll fishery in 1980. This information,however, is insufficient to conclude the frequency of incidental takings.NOAA Fisheries proposes placing Alaskan salmon beach and purse seine fisheries(other than those in Unimak Pass) in Category II. Given the type of fisheryand area fished there is a likelihood of at least occasional intentionaltakings in order to protect gear or catch.The Hawaiian trolling rod-and-reel fishery is included in Category II basedon the likelihood of frequent interactions with dolphins. The interactionsreported are usually dolphins removing bait.The California round haul fisheries are proposed for listing in CategoryII based on information from Miller et al. (1983) documenting at leastan occasional mortality of several species of cetaceans.The Alaska longline groundfish fishery has a likelihood of intentionaltakings to protect gear or catch similar to the Prince William Sound andsoutheastern Bering Sea longline fishery for sablefish. Also, based ongear type, fishermen reports, and other factors there is some likelihoodof at least occasional entanglement of marine mammals. However, there isinsufficient information to estimate the frequency of incidental takings.The remainder of the west coast fisheries listed in Category II (the Metlakatlafishtrap fishery in Alaska, the handline and jig fisheries in Hawaii, thesquid dip net fishery, and the aquaculture salmon fisheries) are includedbecause available information from fishermen reports, studies (e.g. Milleret al. 1983 and Kuljis 1987), and other factors mentioned in criteriontwo indicate that marine mammals are at least occasionally intentionallytaken by fishermen to protect gear and their catch from damage by marinemammals. Information is too sparse to document the frequency of incidentaltakings.Certain east coast fisheries are also being proposed for Category II. TheSouthern New England, Mid-Atlantic offshore squid and Atlantic Ocean mackerelfisheries listed in Table 5, are placed in Category II because there issome information indicating that there is at least an occasional incidentaltaking of a variety of marine mammals. This is based on observer reportsin joint venture operations. There were 33 reported takes of marine mammalsfrom 1985-88 with a high of 20 in 1986. Consequently, these reports combinedwith the likelihood of at least occasional incidental takings based onthe type of fishery and gear involved, justify inclusion of this fisheryin Category II.The Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico pelagic longline fisheries listedin Table 5 are proposed as Category II fisheries. Information collectedby observers on the Japanese fleet of longliners operating in Northeastwaters documented at least occasional incidental takings of marine mammals.Since this fleet is similar in most respects to other pelagic longliners,there is a likelihood of at least occasional incidental takings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Category III Fisheries_Tables 3 and 6</ITAG>Tables 3 and 6 comprise the list of fisheries that have been determinedto have ``a remote likelihood of or no known incidental taking of a marinemammal.'' These fisheries were included in Category II based on the followingcriteria:(1) Committee Reports recommended that the fishery be placed in CategoryIII;(2) There is information indicating no more than a remote likelihood ofan incidental taking of a marine mammal in one fishery; or(3) In the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidentaltaking or where there is no known taking of marine mammals, other factorssuch as gear type, fishing techniques, species fished, areas fished, orduration of fishing season suggest no more than a remote likelihood ofan incidental take;In making this determination, the agency relied on the Senate CommitteeReport which stated that ``fisheries such as the shrimp trawl fishery andmenhaden purse seine fishery in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico,where hundreds of thousands of sets or tows may result in a small totalmortality of animals annually, would be placed in [Category III]'' (SenateCommittee Report, page 17).There is no information available suggesting that the northern Bering Seagillnet fisheries incidentally take marine mammals. Based on factors describedin criterion 3 above, there is only a remote likelihood of a taking incidentalto these fisheries.The likelihood of incidental take of marine mammals in the other categoryIII gillnet fisheries is remote because the seasons are extremely short(e.g. herring fisheries), the mesh size is too small to entangle (e.g.shad, smelt, and herring), or they are conducted in areas where mammalsgenerally are not present (e.g. mullet).Troll fisheries for species other than salmon rarely report losses of fishto marine mammals. Incidental take in troll fisheries usually occurs asintentional lethal removal of animals that are depredating catch and gear.Since troll fisheries identified in Table 3 have not reported fish lossesand troll gear only rarely entangles a marine mammal, NOAA Fisheries believesthat the likelihood that these fisheries will take a marine mammal is remoteand proposes placing them in category III.Marine mammal interactions have been documented for only a few of the roundhaul fisheries (including beach seines and throw nets) identified in Table3. The likelihood of entanglement, serious injury, or mortality of marinemammals as a result of these interactions is remote. No marine mammal interactionshave been reported from the remainder of the round haul fisheries identifiedin Table 3.Marine mammal interactions have also been documented for longline fisheries,but the likelihood of entanglement or intentional takings is remote. Morecommonly, the mammals raid the baited hooks, diminishing the fishermen'sefficiency.With the exception of Alaska, the west coast trawl fisheries generallyhave a remote likelihood of incidentally taking a marine mammal. On rareoccasions, marine mammals may become entrapped in trawl nets. In the Pacificwhiting fishery observers have documented between 1 and 12 takings of marinemammals per year since 1976 by foreign and joint venture operations. Interactionstend to be with pinnipeds attempting to remove fish from the cod end asthe net is retrieved (Miller et al. 1983). Fishermen generally are notbothered by this and few reports of intentional lethal removal are known.Since the likelihood of mortality, serious injury, or entanglement is remoteNOAA Fisheries proposes placing these fisheries in Category III.The nature of the gear or methods used in the remainder of the fisheriesin Table 3 is such that the likelihood of entanglement, serious injury,or mortality of a marine mammal or intentional takings to protect gearor catch is remote.For the following East coast fisheries, there have been reports and informationconcerning incidental takings in these fisheries, but based on factorsmentioned in criterion (3) above there is only a remote likelihood of thesetakings.The Gulf of Maine (GME) Tub Trawl identified in Table 6, is a bottom longlineoperation that occurs within 25 miles offshore. The interactions reportedare usually seals robbing bait and fish from the hooks. But, there is onlya remote likelihood of entanglement or intentional takings to protect gearor catch.Only five vessels are licensed for the GME, Southern New England (SNE),Mid-Atlantic (MDA) Atlantic bluefin tuna purse seine fishery. In 1986,three humpback whales were reported taken by these vessels. This appearsto be an anomalous event because there have been no other reports of marinemammals taken in other years. Since the season for this fishery is veryshort and the purse seines are relatively small compared to those usedin other types of tuna fisheries, there is only a remote likelihood ofincidental takings in this fishery.There have been no reports of marine mammal mortalities in the GME AtlanticHerring Purse Seine and Fixed Gear fisheries. Marine mammals do becomecaptured by gear in these fisheries, but because mesh size of nets usedis small there is only a remote likelihood of entanglement. When marinemammals are captured in this gear, they are generally released withoutinjury.Based on gear type and areas fished, the GME, SNE and MDA coastal gillnetfisheries have only a remote likelihood of incidentally taking marine mammals.These fisheries take place within the lower reaches of the large riversystems, or near the coastal embayments along the East Coast. The fisheriescommonly occur in the spring during anadromous fish runs. Mammal abundancein the coastal areas is usually low at that time. A small gillnet fisheryoperates year-round in the Mid-Atlantic area for various pelagic fish species.The fine mesh nets do not entangle the larger mammal species that frequentthe area.Although there have been some reports of entanglement of marine mammalsin gear used by SNE and MDA Trap and Pound Net fishery, the likelihoodis remote. The reports of entanglement often involve decaying carcassesthat have floated into the gear.There have been periodic reports of marine mammals being entangled in lobsterlines and gear over the past fifteen years in the Gulf of Maine/SouthernNew England inshore lobster pot fishery. However, given the large numberof individual vessels, the nature of this fishery and the gear type used,the likelihood of incidental takings is remote.The GME Atlantic salmon farming fishery is a growing industry along thecoast of Maine. The marine mammal interactions involve seal interferencewith the pens. Non-harassing methods, such as double netting around thepens, have been used to protect fish to date. At this time, however, theredoes not appear to be more than a remote likelihood of entanglement orintentional takings of these marine mammals.For the remaining fisheries listed in Table 6, there is only a remote likelihoodof incidental takings based on gear type, the nature of these fisheries,and other factors listed in criterion 3 above.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Beach, R.J., A.C.
