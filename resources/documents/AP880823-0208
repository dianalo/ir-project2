The 1.4 percent gain in grocery store prices was led by a 9.6percent jump in egg costs, a 7.4 percent boost in poultry costs anda 4.7 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables.   July's overall gain, if it persisted for 12 months, would amountto a yearly inflation rate of 5.2 percent.   The department noted in today's announcement that the food pricegains ``reflect rising input prices, at least partially due to theadverse summer weather,'' and showed that, except for food, pricegains were moderate.   Excluding food and energy costs, consumer prices rose 0.3percent last month, slightly less than the average monthly increaseposted in the first half of 1988.   Energy costs were up 0.3 percent, largely due to a 0.7 percentincrease in gasoline prices. Still, gasoline is slightly cheaperthan in December and 28.1 percent under its price peak of March1981.   Housing costs rose at a 0.3 percent pace for the sixth straightmonth as declines in home heating oil and electricity costs offsethigher charges for natural gas.   Clothing prices dropped 0.6 percent after falling 0.3 percent inJune; those prices had risen 3.8 percent in the first five monthsof 1988.   The Labor Department said that larger than usual end-of-seasonprice reductions in women's clothing were responsible for most ofthe declines.   Medical care costs jumped 0.7 percent to a level 6.6 percentabove where they had been a year ago. Hospital expenses were up 1.0percent while the cost of prescription and over-the-counter drugsgained 0.9 percent.   Transportation expenses rose 0.4 percent after a 0.2 percentrise in June. The higher gasoline prices were largely to blame.   New car prices were unchanged while automobile financing costsgained 0.2 percent. Used car prices were up 0.5 percent _ theirsecond consecutive increase _ but were still below their level atthe end of 1987.   Tobacco prices were up 2.7 percent, the steepest gain for anymajor segment of the monthly price compilation.   Despite the food price increase, meat costs overall declinedslightly as pork prices dropped 2.2 percent and beef and vealprices rose just 0.1 percent as farmers trimmed herds.   Cereal and bakery product prices gained 1.1 percent whilecooking oil posted a 1.0 percent price increase.   Food costs overall rose 1.0 percent for the month as sloweradvances of 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, were postedfor restaurant meals and alcoholic beverages.   The July increases brought the consumer price index to 118.5,meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 1982would have cost $118.50 last month, 50 cents more than in June and$4.70 more than a year ago.   The Reagan administration, labor unions and major businessgroups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce _ contrary to theFederal Reserve Board _ all maintain that inflation remains undercontrol and that any one-month rise in consumer prices poses noproblem.   The Federal Reserve earlier this month boosted its discountrate, the interest it charges for overnight loans to banks, from6.0 percent to 6.5 percent, out of concerns that inflation wasbeginning to gain a toehold on the economy.   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co. of New York,said a 0.5 percent increase in wholesale prices last month shouldbe taken as a ``red flag of warning'' that the U.S. economy is on amuch higher inflation curve than the 4 percent to 5 percent thathad been forecast for this year.   ``The behavior of wages, tightness of labor markets,increasingly tighter product markets and running out of slackbetween potential and actual output all suggest a higher range ofinflation as an ongoing reality,'' he said.   Because of that, Sinai and other pessimists on the inflationfront said the Federal Reserve can be expected to ``lean'' towardraising interest rates again after boosting them half a percentagepoint earlier this month, but not necessarily before the Novemberelection.   Other analysts, however, agree with the administration andbusiness and labor groups that inflation remains under control.   Michael Evans, who runs an economic forecasting firm inWashington, said most analysts were ``spooked'' by the Julyincrease in wholesale prices.   ``In spite of what you may read in the headlines about thenegative effects of the drought, too many people working or toomuch being produced ..., inflation expectations have returned tonormal,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
