The Supreme National Council, created last week during talks inIndonesia's capital, Jakarta, met for three hours at the CambodianEmbassy. The embassy had been abandoned since 1975, but 100 Thaiworkers cleared it of overgrown foliage and repainted it over theweekend.   ``There were some problems, and we will have to resumediscussions tomorrow,'' said Premier Hun Sen of theVietnamese-installed government. He would not elaborate.   The council has six seats for the Vietnam-installed Phnom Penhgovernment and two spots for each of the rebel factions. The planalso allows for a 13th seat for a chairman, but the post remains indispute.   The guerrillas want Sihanouk to hold the chairman seat. A ThaiForeign Ministry official said Hun Sen replied that Sihanouk couldonly be chairman if he also takes the spot of one of the dozenregular members.   Sihanouk officials accused Hun Sen of ``intransigence.''   The council now includes six representatives of Hun Sen'sgovernment and two representatives from each of the three alliedguerrilla groups.   Not discussed were other items Hun Sen placed on the agenda:choosing a delegation to this week's U.N. General Assembly, andarranging a ``voluntary cease-fire'' and an end to outside militaryaid.   The rebel coalition includes the non-Communist forces ofSihanouk and former Cambodian premier Son Sann, who have beenbacked by Washington, and the Chinese-backed Communist Khmer Rouge,ousted by the Vietamese in 1978.   During nearly four years in power, the Khmer Rouge tried totransform Cambodia into a radical agrarian society, resulting inthe deaths of nearly 1 million people.   The Supreme National Council would cede much of its authority tothe United Nations, which would administer the country until freeelections. U.N. officials have said up to 20,000 troops andcivilian personnel could be sent to Cambodia to oversee the plan.   The U.N. plan, which also calls for disarming the four armies,was adopted Aug. 28 by the five permanent members of the U.N.Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britainand France.   Hun Sen met in the session with Khieu Samphan of the KhmerRouge, Son Sann of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front andPrince Norodom Ranariddh, who commands forces loyal to Sihanouk,his father.   The sparsely furnished meeting room was decorated with freshflowers and photographs of Cambodia, including one of Angkor Wat,ancient capital of its greatest civilization.</TEXT></DOC>
