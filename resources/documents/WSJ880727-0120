First the Vietnamese engineer, now 39, spent three years in a re-education camp, won by virtue of the degree he held from Long Beach University in the U.S. Then came last year's journey by foot, bus and ferry from Vietnam, across the Mekong River into Cambodia, down to a rendezvous at a coastal village where a boat was waiting, all to wash ashore in Thailand with his wife just before Christmas. Now Mr. and Mrs. Chuong are stuck here, in one of the fiberboard-and-bamboo-thatch huts that are home to 24,418 other Vietnamese, Hmong, Khmer and Lao refugees.    But in the camps Mr. Chuong is one of the lucky ones, because his two brothers and a sister living in California are his magic ticket to America. For Southeast Asia, by contrast, the Chuongs are but part of a renewed surge of refugees from Indochina that represents the region's biggest headache next to the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. Pointing to the thousands of refugees that have been waiting years for resettlement, Asian governments talk &quot;crisis proportions&quot; and &quot;compassion fatigue.&quot; They are calling the new arrivals &quot;economic migrants,&quot; a charge disputed by even the political victims.    &quot;If you want to talk about freedom, in Vietnam they don't have the freedom to practice their religion, to go on strike, to travel or even to choose their jobs,&quot; says Mr. Chuong, a soft-spoken man dressed in gray-striped slacks, sandals and a blue sports shirt. &quot;What do you call that -- political or economic?&quot;    Although the distinction between political and economic refugees has surfaced before, it has been given new impetus by Hanoi's announcement this month that it may start to take people back. The governor of Hong Kong, Sir David Wilson, invoked it in London last week when he stated on BBC radio that the people leaving Vietnam now &quot;are not refugees.&quot; In Bangkok this month the ASEAN foreign ministers in a joint communique similarly called for &quot;effective measures&quot; to ensure the &quot;return of those who do not meet international criteria for refugee status.&quot; Even the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Jean-Pierre Hocke, has spoken of &quot;those leaving for socioeconomic reasons or reasons of personal convenience,&quot; and Secretary of State George Shultz wrapped up his Asian trip with a reference to the need of people &quot;whose motivations are basically economic.&quot;    The reason this is more than arguing angels on pinheads is that the label &quot;economic migrants&quot; paves the way for packing these people back to Vietnam and thus discourages others from coming. In turn, because any kind of forced repatriation would invoke a storm of unwanted international protest, the moral claim to asylum of these refugees must first be undermined, by comparing them with, say, Mexicans who cross the U.S. border for work.    &quot;The term 'economic migrant' is not backed up by any evidence,&quot; says Bob Medrala, director of the American Relief Committee, which provides medical care for camps in Thailand. Mr. Medrala points out that Mexican illegals make no such claims about being refugees and face no penalties when they return home. Economic migrant, he says, &quot;is used here to conjure up images of evil, conniving, money-hungry gangs of entrepreneurs. It does not even begin to get at the desperation of these people.&quot;    But governments employ the term &quot;economic migrants&quot; not because it's more precise but because they know the only way to stop boat people from coming is repatriation; even those squatting it out in the hideous concrete camps of Hong Kong stubbornly say they would leave Vietnam all over again for the chance of being free. The realization that they mean what they say has spawned some ugly policies and threats of uglier ones to come. In January, for example, Thailand began pushing back Vietnamese boats along its coastlines. Indonesia has been redirecting boats toward Malaysia for some time now; Singapore has consistently refused to let people land; and Malaysia announced that next spring any unsettled refugees will simply be given boats and provisions to set sail again.    But it has been left to Hong Kong to push for the least honest route with a screening policy that deems all new arrivals illegal immigrants unless they can prove otherwise. One indication how fair any such screening is bound to be is illustrated by government statements that 90% of arrivals are economic migrants before any were in fact screened. Most of these people, moreover, are peasants; ask them why they left and you're not going to get quotations from Leszek Kolakowski's &quot;Main Currents of Marxism.&quot; But for bureaucracies determined to make the refugees disappear simply by defining them out of existence, the boat people's simple answers to pointed questions will allow their names to be erased from the refugee column and penciled in under the newly created one of economic migrant.    &quot;Economic migrant has no meaning in law,&quot; notes the director of the Political Asylum Project for the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Arthur C. Helton. &quot;It's always used by governments -- left, right and middle -- to prejudge cases.&quot;    Part of the problem is the existing definition of refugees under the U.N. protocol, now enshrined in U.S. law: someone with a &quot;well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.&quot; Government officials point out that the new wave of boat people are not ethnic Chinese fleeing racial persecution and that many are North Vietnamese and thus have nothing to single them out. UNHCR officials craftily avoid a stand by saying that they favor anything that helps them identify real refugees who need their help. But as any former resident would attest, trying to separate the economic from the political in a totalitarian society is like trying to separate the blue from the sky.    Prior to becoming a party to the U.N. protocol in 1980, American law concerning refugees did appear to have taken the blanket nature of totalitarian misery into account in a clause that referred to those fleeing &quot;from any Communist or Communist-dominated country or area.&quot; The figures today suggest refugee policy would benefit from a return to that recognition. Of the 12 million people the UNHCR recognizes as refugees, the lion's share are those fleeing Marxist regimes: some 5.4 million from Afghanistan; at least 1.4 million from Ethiopia; more than 600,000 from Mozambique; some 400,000 from Angola, and the more than 400,000 from Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. In other words, these people are refugees from a system.    Ultimately, the latest moves to reclassify these refugees as &quot;economic migrants&quot; represent a surrender to the same sterile philosophy that set off the exodus in the first place, an irony not lost on those who work amid the barbed wire and corrugated tin of the closed camps. &quot;It's frustrating for us to see people spinning their wheels in a place like this when they could be productive somewhere else,&quot; says Don Sharp, a doctor here at Phanat Nikhom who has also treated Afghan refugees in Pakistan. &quot;The world should be fighting to get these people to come.&quot;    ---   Mr. McGurn is deputy editorial page editor of The Asian Wall Street Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
