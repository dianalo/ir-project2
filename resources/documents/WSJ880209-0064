Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BNK REL </IN><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four former officers and borrowers of now-failed Texas banks and savings and loan associations agreed to plead guilty to federal banking-law violations and to cooperate with a continuing bank-fraud investigation here.    One of the four, John G. Smith, is a former top official at now-defunct Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association of Dallas. Vernon was one of Texas's most highflying Sandamp;L institutions. It was known for its fancy private air fleet, posh California beach house and a loan portfolio in which 96% of the loans were bad when it was seized by regulators last year. Mr. Smith's cooperation may be extremely valuable in the government's criminal inquiry of Vernon.    A fifth Sandamp;L borrower was charged by a federal grand jury here in a three-count indictment with conspiracy, aiding the misapplication of a thrift's funds and making false statements to thrift regulators. The indictment stems out of an alleged kickback scheme in which the borrower, Donald W. Nahrwold, a former Lubbock, Texas real estate broker, directed the payment of a kickback to an Sandamp;L owner in return for a $2 million real estate loan. Reached in California, Mr. Nahrwold asserted his innocence.    The indictment and the plea arrangements, which were expected, are the first in a much-heralded three-to-five year federal bank-fraud probe of some three dozen Texas banks and thrifts. A 50-member task force, including agents from the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is looking into an apparent network of kickbacks, phony land sales and evidence that Sandamp;L officials and borrowers may have filed false financial statements and conspired to violate banking laws. As previously reported, the banking records of some 400 individuals have been subpoenaed.    Mr. Smith agreed to plead guilty to filing a false financial statement about Vernon with federal thrift regulators, prosecutors said.    Federal prosecutors also said Tyrell G. &quot;Terry&quot; Barker, the former owner and chairman of the failed State Savings andamp; Loan Association, Lubbock, waived his right to an indictment and agreed to plead guilty to misapplication of a thrift's funds. Mr. Barker, who was convicted last year of bank fraud, currently is in a Florida federal prison. Justice Department officials said he received a $100,000 kickback on the $2 million loan made in 1983 by State Sandamp;L.    Mr. Nahrwold's Make Lots of Money Quick Partnership was in a Midland, Texas, commercial real estate joint venture with Larry K. Thompson, a former Midland real estate broker and developer. Prosecutors said Mr. Thompson obtained the $2 million loan from Mr. Barker's Sandamp;L, pocketed a $200,000 commission on the sale of land and gave half the fee to Mr. Barker as a kickback. Mr. Thompson also waived indictment and pled guilty to misapplication of the loan, the prosecutors said.    The government also said Sam Thomas III, the former chairman and chief executive officer of the defunct Commerce Bank, Plano, Texas, agreed to plead guilty to filing a false quarterly financial report on the bank with federal banking regulators. Mr. Thomas also pled guilty to using an unauthorized letter of credit to be used as collateral for a loan at Northwest Bank, Dallas, prosecutors said. Northwest Bank failed last month. </TEXT></DOC>
