In a statement, Chicago-based UAL said the proposed $4.5 billion buyout would handicap a separately owned United by saddling it with enormous debt. It also asserted that United would have fewer competitive advantages without its current association with UAL's rental car and hotel units.    The UAL reaction was expected by industry analysts, several of whom noted that the company couldn't flatly reject the union's proposal without risking shareholder lawsuits. Few said they expect UAL to eventually accept the bid, made by the United branch of the Washington, D.C.-based Air Line Pilots Association.    Specialists on Wall Street and in the airline industry said the significance of the proposal by the pilots union likely will depend on whether or not it stirs up other bidders for UAL. &quot;The pilots union can't do this on their own,&quot; said an investment banker who was consulted about the union proposal.    While there weren't any immediate signs of another proposal, UAL traded very actively yesterday, rising as much as $9 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading early in the day. However, it closed at $65.75, up $6.75. With almost 3.5 million shares changing hands, it was the Big Board's second most active issue.    Meanwhile, New York investor Donald Trump appeared content to remain on the sidelines -- at least for the moment. Mr. Trump owns slightly less than 5% of UAL's shares and is said to be interested in acquiring some of the company's real estate properties, such as the Westin and Hilton hotels. Mr. Trump declined to comment on speculation that the pilots' bid might help him achieve a UAL breakup.    The possibility that the pilots' proposal might spark other bidders apparently was a major concern at UAL. Its management met throughout the day yesterday to weigh its options. Officials said that although UAL already has implemented a number of takeover defenses, others were being considered -- including a restructuring.    However, UAL Chairman Richard Ferris, according to an associate, wants to avoid being hounded by Wall Street to break up UAL to achieve a higher value for holders. Some estimates by investment bankers have put the breakup value of UAL at more than $100 a share.    As previously reported, the pilots union proposed to acquire United through an employee stock ownership plan. The union said it would use $500 million in excess pension fund assets toward the purchase price and fund the balance with subordinated notes and other financing.    UAL said the union's plan would commit United to a debt level equal to more than 90% of its total capitalization. It questioned whether a company carrying such debt could compete effectively. Company officials also expressed doubts about the union's plan to offset debt costs with wage reductions and other actions that will reduce United's costs as much as $300 million annually. &quot;They'd have to take something like a 60% pay cut to achieve that,&quot; said a United official. </TEXT></DOC>
