Unlike other big funds principally aimed at leveraged buy-outs, the new Lazard fund, named Corporate Partners Limited Partnership, will buy only friendly, minority equity positions in companies. The fund will take 10% to 40% stakes in companies that are actual or potential takeover targets, a tactic commonly known as a &quot;white squire&quot; defense.    &quot;Most managements would like to have no shareholders. But as long as they have to have shareholders, it is good that they can have large friendly ones,&quot; Michel David-Weill, Lazard's senior partner, said in an interview.    Lazard thus becomes the latest entrant in Wall Street's already crowded field of takeover-related funds. The proliferation of such funds has created a pool of more than $20 billion that has helped drive up takeover prices. The size of Lazard's fund is topped only by those managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., Forstmann Little andamp; Co. and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Last summer, Lazard said it had accumulated funding commitments for more than $1 billion, and aimed to gather a total of $2 billion. Its goal was scaled back after the stock-market crash of Oct. 19, the firm said yesterday.    Lazard, a 54-partner investment banking firm known as low-profile and conservative, said it hopes its fund can serve as a less risky alternative to the increasingly competitive leveraged buy-out field. It comes when a growing number of management buy-outs are being topped by unsolicited bids -- a development that has made managers more wary of attempting buyouts. In recent months officials at J.P. Stevens andamp; Co. and Amfac Inc., among others, have begun buy-outs only to see the company get taken over by others.    Also, the increasingly aggressive nature of big buy-out funds like KKR's and Odyssey Partners may make them less attractive to managers seeking friendly partners in a takeover situation. After agreeing to a joint buy-out with Stevens, for instance, Odyssey ultimately turned on the company and split it up with a competing bidder, West Point-Pepperell Inc.    The Lazard fund is headed by Lester Pollack, a founding partner of Odyssey who has a long track record of dealing with touchy takeover situations. Mr. Pollack said he has told the fund's about 40 limited investors, which include major pension funds and other institutional investors, that &quot;we have no possibility of an acquisition attempt, no possibility of seeking control.&quot;    Lazard plans to keep its investments for three to six years while taking seats on company boards, the firm said. By negotiating these purchases in private placements, the firm hopes to shelter the fund from the high prices now being paid in many mergers.    Lazard changed the fund's original name from Crossroads Partners after it discovered a venture capital fund with the same name. </TEXT></DOC>
