The estimate of growth in the world population --currently 5.3 billion -- outstrips all previous forecasts,the State of the World Population report from the U.N.Population Fund said. The environment and poorer countries,where 90% of the rise will occur, will suffer most as thepopulation increases by three people every second -- about aquarter of a million each day -- the report said.   The report said that while the industrialized countrieswere mainly responsible for damage to the ozone layer and forroughly two-thirds of global warming, the combination ofpoverty and population growth was causing deforestation andland degradation in the developing world.   The 1990s will see greater growth than any decade in humanhistory, with 90 million to 100 million more people eachyear, the report said. During the next century, it predicted,global population will probably double and could triple.                                                                                                          INDIA CLEANSES FILM INDUSTRY                                                                                                          India, whose huge film industry turns out more than 700films a year, has ordered censors to purge the nation'smovies of sex and violence, said Information and BroadcastingMinister Parvathaneni Upendra. Although Indian films areconservative by Western standards -- both nudity and kissingare banned -- rape scenes are common, and &quot;Scenes glorifyingsex and violence have crossed the limits of decency,&quot; Mr.Upendra said. Under new rules, censors would also refuse toapprove movies promoted by posters showing vulgar scenes, hesaid.   SOUTH KOREA FIGHTS CORRUPTION                                                                                                          As part of a new anti-corruption investigation ofgovernment officials in South Korea, the prosecutor general'soffice announced the arrest of four present or former Seoulcity officers.

While the colony's labor shortage has been aprime factor behind spiraling local prices, Jason Kwok,senior economist at Bank of East Asia, warned that it'spremature to say inflation may be easing. &quot;I'd like to waitto see data for a few more months,&quot; he said. &quot;We also have totake into account what the property market will be doingbefore making any pronouncements about inflation.&quot;                                                                                                          SOVIETS' LATE BILL PAYMENTS                                                                                                          Japan reportedly doubled the rate on export insurance tothe Soviet Union after hearing from major Japanese tradinghouses that Soviet trading organizations were late in payingtheir bills.
