Census data, health statistics, earnings breakdownsand SAT scores: Mr. Hacker has long wielded figures as oldmasters wield red, yellow and blue, using just the rightamounts in just the right places to create a telling portraitof American life. &quot;Two Nations: Black and White, Separate,Hostile, Unequal&quot; (Scribner's, 257 pages, $24.95) lives up tothis high standard and provides an informative picture of thevery different ways the two races live.   The portrait is a troubling one: indeed, a picture of twonations. Alongside it, in a rather different voice, Mr.Hacker ventures to explain the enduring gap. He offers hisview, which he admits is &quot;subjective,&quot; with some passion andevident concern to help. Unfortunately, unlike his masterlydepiction, that interpretation -- that the problem stemsentirely from white racism -- seems quite unfounded by thefacts and difficult to credit today.</LP><TEXT>   The numbers are stark and irrefutable. For all theprogress of recent decades, blacks still live on the marginsof the economy (they are twice as likely to be unemployed andseveral times more likely to have stopped looking for work).Those who do work earn less (between $580 and $907, dependingon age and sex, for every $1,000 whites earn). Most (63%)still attend segregated schools. Average black SAT scoresfall 200 points below those of whites. Black women are threetimes more likely to bear children outside marriage, andblack men make up a hugely disproportionate 45% of allprisoners. The black middle class has tripled, but, says Mr.Hacker, even that is misleading. According to &quot;Two Nations,&quot;it is not unusual for a middle-class white to bring $75,000 ayear home to a nonworking wife, while the typical blackmiddle-class couple, say a nurse and a bus driver, scramblesto make do on two salaries of $30,000 each.   The more difficult question is why this divide persists.In Mr. Hacker's view, the answer is as clear-cut as thenumbers: &quot;America is inherently a `white country,'&quot; whereblacks live against their will and ever ill at ease.Professional norms are biased, curriculums discouraging,&quot;white institutions,&quot; by nature, unwelcoming and unfair toblacks. This is a result of clashing cultures, but also,still, deliberate: Whites are still &quot;keeping {blacks} . . .behind the starting line.&quot; Blacks, accordingly, exist only aspassive victims. The dissolution of black families followsnaturally from &quot;the strains that come with being black.&quot; Eventhe anger of black criminals, says Mr. Hacker, isunderstandable: Rebellious teens turn to violent crimebecause they lack other options, whether legal work orcushier white-collar crime.   The long roster of accusations in &quot;Two Nations&quot; is notentirely unfounded. Racism is hardly dead, in either theblack or the white world, and white readers in particular mayneed to be reminded just how different things can look from ablack vantage point. But it serves neither blacks nor whitesto see deliberate racism where other complex forces are infact at work. If many blacks are still indeed &quot;behind thestarting line,&quot; surely this has as much to do with centuriesof disadvantage as with lingering white bias or contemporaryobstacles. True enough, in the broadest sense, &quot;whiteAmerica&quot; is responsible for this historical handicap, but itdoes not follow that most whites alive today are stillactively conspiring to keep blacks back. The two explanationsmay sound similar, but the difference between them iscritical -- largely because they suggest such differentremedies.   Again and again, in a dozen different ways, Mr. Hackerundermines himself by overstating his case. Perceiving thatmost whites have no idea how different and bitter blacksfeel, he tries in one chapter to write as if he were a blackman. The effect is an angry indictment -- and some whites mayfind it eye-opening -- but in the end it seems contrived andpatronizing. Surely blacks have ample spokesmen to expresstheir racial views -- the nuanced, ambivalent views, and theshriller ones that Mr. Hacker trades in. Elsewhere in thebook, he speculates fantastically about what goes on insidethe heads of &quot;typical&quot; whites. &quot;At least I am prepared totell {blacks},&quot; he says, promoting his book, &quot;this is whatAmerica really thinks about you.&quot; The question is just how heknows what most white people &quot;really think.&quot; He offers noevidence, not even for his most sensational claims: that mostwhites still feel blacks are inferior and inherently &quot;suited&quot;to menial work, that whites still &quot;need&quot; to see blacks as&quot;niggers&quot; in order to feel good about themselves.   It is often easy, reading &quot;Two Nations,&quot; to forget thatthe past 30 years happened. Mr. Hacker gives whites no creditfor any new openness. He puts little store by black progressand seems not to have noticed how successfully black Americahas taken its destiny in its own hands, defying bigotry,beating the odds but also, for better or worse, charting itsown political course. In his time-warped portrait of America,whites are still calling all the shots -- and still, by theirvery white skins, perpetuating the slights of history. Notonly is this unfair and inaccurate, it also makes it harderfor both sides to move ahead. More overheated accusationswill not heal divisions, only create more paranoia anddefensiveness. That is not the way to close the persistentrifts -- in class and culture and economic survival skills --that Mr. Hacker documents so well with his statistics.   ---   Ms. Jacoby is writing a book on the recent history of racerelations.</TEXT></DOC>
