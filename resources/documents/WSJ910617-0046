The industry has endured a year of the most turbulentbusiness conditions since airline deregulation in 1978. Therecession, the Gulf War, sky-high fuel costs and steep farecuts have triggered industry losses of about $6 billion inthe past 12 months.</LP><TEXT>   The result is a greatly changed domestic airline business.A number of major carriers, several once-mighty forces in theskies, are struggling to survive. Eastern Airlines has beenforced into liquidation and three other carriers -- PanAmerican World Airways, Continental Airlines and MidwayAirlines -- have filed for federal bankruptcy-law protection.   But healthier carriers have used this period to win newmarkets, enhance service and grab market share -- exactlywhat deregulation was expected to foster, industry officialsmaintain. &quot;Deregulation is doing what it was supposed to do,&quot;contends Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers. &quot;The current environment has just speeded theprocess.&quot;   Against the backdrop of that environment, here is a lookat the major airlines and their future prospects:                                                                                                          FLYING HIGH                                                                                                          American Airlines                                                                                                          When the recession first took hold last summer, thenation's largest, richest airline turned downright penurious.Chairman Robert Crandall beseeched employees to use bothsides of photocopy paper and to turn lights out in emptyoffices.   But American didn't hoard its savings. The airline went ona buying spree, snapping up assets -- most notablyinternational routes from Eastern and TWA -- that came on themarket because of the industry's hard times. And now, theunit of AMR Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, is planning more than$20 billion in capital spending by 1995, mostly for new,fuel-efficient jets and expansion of domestic facilities.   The combination of careful cost controls, strategic assetpurchases and ambitious capital spending promises to keepAmerican perched atop the industry for some time to come. Thecarrier is getting increasingly aggressive at overseasexpansion efforts. Internationally, where the biggestopportunities for growth lie, American has added significantroutes to Europe and Latin America. A major disappointmenthas been its Pacific expansion; the airline didn't get theroutes to Japan it coveted.   American, which in the 1980s led the industry byinstituting a two-tier pay scale for its unionized workers,recently signed an expensive new contract with its pilotsthat narrows that gap. The carrier said that while the movelessens its cost advantage, the contract doesn't eliminateit.                                                                                                          Delta Air Lines                                                                                                          Conservative Delta has avoided the recent asset-buyingbinges favored by rivals American and United. TheAtlanta-based carrier shuns expensive international routepurchases, preferring to initiate its own service and addforeign destinations one by one. It buys new aircraft a fewat a time on a regular basis, so its capital spending holdssteady, too.   But there are signs Delta may forgo some of its methodicalways, especially as it plays catch-up overseas. The carrierrecently raised $476 million in its first stock offeringsince 1962, saying it was for foreign expansion. It isconsidering a Taipei hub, which could boost lucrative PacificRim service. Although the airline won't comment, sources sayit is weighing a bid for some or all of Pan Am Corp.'sassets; financially ailing Pan Am has attractive LatinAmerican routes and North Atlantic flights but wants to sellitself whole.   When the recession and Gulf War fears sharply curbedgrowth in passenger traffic this spring, Delta embraced aquestionable strategy of using deep discounts to keep itstraffic numbers fairly high -- a 15% jump in April, forinstance, and 12% in May. The approach was costly; Delta lostnearly $350 million during the first nine months of its 1991fiscal year.   Still, because it has managed to maintain market share,Delta may be the best positioned among all the major carriersfor an uptick in the economy and increases in ticket prices.                                                                                                          Southwest Airlines                                                                                                          Southwest has found a gold mine in frequent, inexpensiveshort-hop flights stretching across 14 states.   That formula is proving successful again as theDallas-based carrier beefs up its presence in heavilycompetitive California, where some bigger carriers have givenup. Southwest currently has 783 California flights a week,and expects to add 18 more this week. Since Southwest beganservice between Oakland and Burbank last year, it has becomeone of the fastest growing U.S. air-travel markets.   The carrier generally skirts head-to-head competition withthe industry giants on coast-to-coast flights. It focusesinstead on a network of flights that average just under anhour apiece, usually between smaller U.S. cities. Southwest'schief rival, America West Airlines, has a slew of financialwoes and is finding it increasingly difficult to matchSouthwest's $53 average ticket price.   Southwest can charge low prices because it providesno-frills service and has among the lowest costs in theindustry. By flying only one kind of plane -- three versionsof the Boeing 737 -- Southwest keeps maintenance costs down.It has also come to count on high productivity and extremeloyalty from its 9,000 workers. When oil prices skyrocketedlast fall, employees bought the airline $135,000 worth of jetfuel through payroll deductions.                                                                                                          United Airlines                                                                                                          After years of internal strife and failed buy-outattempts, the UAL Corp. unit has been reborn. TheChicago-based carrier is growing at the rate of one newairplane per week and is now locked in a dead heat withAmerican Airlines for first place in the industry.   Led by Stephen M. Wolf -- who was nearly fired last fallbut instead survived a failed employee buy-out attempt --United is beginning to benefit from its strong, diversedomestic-route system and a dominant presence in Asia.   The airline is making an aggressive foray into Europe andis closing the gaps where American has held a decisive edge:in labor and service. Signs: a recently ratified 3 1/2-yearpilots' union contract that helps solve some pesky labordisputes and first-class trans-Atlantic service complete withDom Perignon champagne, Beluga caviar and Godiva chocolates.   United isn't slowing its pace. Proceeds from about $1.2billion in recent equity and bond offerings could be used tofund more acquisitions. &quot;If someone wants to sell somethingthat relates to our plans, we're certainly interested inlistening,&quot; says Mr. Wolf.                                                                                                          REVIEWS MIXED                                                                                                          Northwest Airlines                                                                                                          The Eagan, Minn.-based airline was smiling recently whenit won clearance of a $740 million aid package from the stateof Minnesota. The cash from the hometown coffers should helpNorthwest keep up with the industry giants as they grow andbid for the remains of dying carriers. But while it has agood domestic structure -- with hubs in Minneapolis-St. Paul,Detroit and Memphis -- Northwest might just have too manyholes in its system to take on the dominant domestic players.   Moving to fill the holes, the closely held, highlyleveraged NWA Inc. unit has purchased defunct EasternAirlines' Washington National operations for $35.5 million.And the airline is expected to soon strike a deal to operatethe Trump Shuttle under a plan that would enhance Northwest'sEast Coast presence and give it the future option of buyingthe shuttle. Additionally, Northwest is mulling enteringAtlanta, where Delta rules, but analysts figure such a movecould cost Northwest as much as $500 million.   Albert Checchi, NWA's co-chairman has hinted at thepossibility of selling the carrier's lucrative Pacific system-- now second to United in the region -- and retrenchingsolely as a domestic player. He is also seeking concessionsfrom labor unions.                                                                                                          USAir                                                                                                          USAir Group Inc.'s recent mergers of PSA and Piedmontcreated a puzzle with pieces that wouldn't fit. Farediscounting in PSA's California market and on the East Coastcontributed heavily to USAir's $455 million net loss in 1990.A subsequent restructuring plan -- 7,100 layoffs, eliminationof service in eight West Coast cities and a reduction offlights in Baltimore and Cleveland -- is now in place.   Announcing Seth Schofield as his successor last month,exiting chief executive Edwin Colodny outlined what he calledUSAir's &quot;positive developments&quot; for 1991. He cited theliquidation of Eastern and the exit of Midway Airlines fromUSAir's Philadelphia hub. But fresh management and themisfortune of other airlines may not be enough.   Despite its missteps, the Virginia-based carrier still hasa strong domestic route system, which makes it an attractivepartner for an international carrier seeking access to theU.S. market. Should Congress clear foreign voting control forairlines above the current 25% limit, USAir's savior couldarrive from across the seas.                                                                                                          PROSPECTS CLOUDY                                                                                                          America West                                                                                                          One of the few airlines born since deregulation that isstill flying, America West's prospects are hazy. Heavyleverage and aggressive expansion in the late 1980s made fora weak balance sheet. Those problems were exacerbated by lastyear's high fuel prices, air-travel slump and the continuingrecession. To cope, America West instituted cost-cuttingmeasures such as pay cuts for officers and reductions in itsflight schedule.   With the second-lowest labor costs among major airlines,the Phoenix-based carrier would seem to have a major costadvantage. &quot;The bad news is they compete with Southwest,which has even lower labor costs,&quot; notes Tom Longman, ananalyst with Bear Stearns.   Several ticket-discount offers by America West raisedquick cash earlier in the year but may have served toaggravate the carrier's money woes. America West was forcedto renegotiate with its banks earlier this year because itwas in violation of certain loan covenants. Last week,America West said it suspended about $75 million in leasepayments on some aircraft and was negotiating alease-deferral pact. Chairman Edward J. Beauvais insists thefinancial maneuverings will have no effect on the carrier'sservice.                                                                                                          Continental Airlines                                                                                                          Weighed down by debt piled on during the acquisitive1980s, Continental tumbled into Chapter 11 in December. Butthat didn't scare off passengers and hasn't yet affectedflight operations.   Even under Chapter 11, the Houston-based unit ofContinental Airlines Holdings Inc. has accomplished limitedexpansion, adding defunct Eastern Airlines' New York routesand a few Atlanta flights. Last week, Continental startedflights to Frankfurt, Germany. The airline is blessed with astrong route system and good hubs. Chairman Hollis Harris,who succeed Frank Lorenzo last summer, is considered a strongoperator.   &quot;They've got everything going for them except theirbalance sheet,&quot; says Dillon Read analyst Ray Neidl. &quot;If theycan restructure that, they'll be one tough littlecompetitor.&quot;   That may be one tough job. The airline's fate remains verymuch up to its creditors, many of whom were burned in theEastern bankruptcy proceedings. Continental has deferred manyaircraft lease payments and is considering a debt-for-equityswap with other creditors. The airline is seeking $600million from investors.                                                                                                          Midway Airlines                                                                                                          Chairman David Hinson regards the airline's currentquagmire as &quot;just the type of situation that Chapter 11reorganization is designed for.&quot; Indeed, Midway's decision toconcentrate on its profitable niche in the Midwest and itsChapter 11 filing in March give the airline a fair chance offuture success.   The Chicago-based carrier, the first major airline tostart operation after airlines became deregulated in 1978,buzzed along until it swooped into Philadelphia, where itspent $100 million to start a hub in USAir's back yard.Midway lost the ensuing turf war, selling the Philadelphiaoperation to USAir for $64 million. &quot;We learned that you needa crystal ball in this business,&quot; says Mr. Hinson.   According to Mr. Hinson, &quot;The worst is behind us.&quot; Butwith United and American keeping the pressure on in theChicago market, the economic recovery and a rebound intraffic must soon come about if Midway is to avoid failure.                                                                                                          Pan American World Airways                                                                                                          The airline that &quot;taught the world to fly&quot; appears to beteaching other ailing airlines how to die -- by squeezing outevery valuable drop of life. The New York-based airline, oncethe nation's pre-eminent air carrier, has sold off assets,piece by piece. Since filing for Chapter 11 protection inJanuary, Pan Am has struggled with creditors, dodging mostairplane repossessions, and has continued to flyuninterrupted service.   The carrier got a temporary boost from the $400 millionsale of its London routes to United Airlines, and even thePersian Gulf War provided what a Pan Am spokesman called &quot;asilver lining.&quot; Under contract with Uncle Sam, Pan Amconverted some of its planes to military transports and flewthree or four flights daily to and from the Persian Gulf.   But the end is drawing near, and the last of Pan Am'sassets, mainly its Latin America service and the Pan AmShuttle, are on the block. Delta Airlines, unlike otherpotential buyers, isn't scared away by Pan Am's huge laborcosts and underfunded pension plan. An offer could come soonfor Pan Am to merge with Delta.   Citing strong advance summer bookings, Pan Am ChairmanThomas Plaskett says the airline can remain &quot;liquid for thenext few months.&quot;                                                                                                          Trans World Airlines                                                                                                          A weak route system, a debt-laden balance sheet andtroublesome labor relations dragged down the Mt. Kisco, N.Y.,carrier last year -- even before the Gulf crisis compoundedmatters. Now, TWA's international service has been slashed inhalf due to low traffic, and fixed costs have thrust theairline at the mercy of creditors threatening to repossessplanes and equipment.   Outspoken investor Carl Icahn, who purchased the airlinein 1986, is busily talking up his &quot;three-prong&quot; attack tosave TWA from the brink of bankruptcy. His plan: To useproceeds from the pending sale of the carrier's London routesto American to buy back debt at reduced prices; to replacethe airline's aging fleet; and to get further unionconcessions.   But congressional leaders who originally endorsed Mr.Icahn's purchase of the airline now are skeptical of hisability to run it. And early this month in St. Louis, whereTWA operates its main hub, Mr. Icahn was greeted by 700hostile employees who interrupted a question-and-answersession, screaming such things as &quot;Why should we give youmore money?&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          TRANS WORLD AIRLINES says it has recently increased itsinternational service to about 90% of the levels before thePersian Gulf War. Monday's edition incorrectly said TWA'sforeign service was still about half the prewar levels.   (WSJ June 19, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
