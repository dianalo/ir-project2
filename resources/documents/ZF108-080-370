(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Diskless ApproachandM;In the diskless category, there are three different kinds of machines:disk-less, terminal/diskless PC, and netstation.andP;  The first are simplyscaled-down PCs with the hard drives ripped out.andP;  The processor, RAM, andnetwork connections are in a small, silent box.andP;  The main advantage to theseis that they're inexpensive.andP;  A hard drive can account for a third of acomputer's price and by removing it from the box, you can save hundreds ofdollars per machine.andP;  They are also have the advantage of being quiet;without the disk drive, there's no continual hum of a cooling fan.andP;  Severalcompanies offer regular-sized PCs without the disks, which take up as muchspace as any PC but are often cheaper even than the smaller models.andM;The second type of diskless PC, the terminal/diskless workstation, is an ANSIor ASCII terminal offering a connection to a LAN.andP;  There machines, such asthose from Esprit and Datamedia, can switch with a simple keystroke frombeing a dumb terminal to a pretty ciever network workstation.andP;  They aresimilarly quiet, small, and cheap with flexibility, something other disklessmachines are not.andM;The final kind of machine, netstations, are not modified PCs, but redesignedaltogether.andP;  The EarthStation from Earth Computer, for example, is completelycontained within a keyboard.andP;  Simply attach keyboard to a monitor and yourdesktop is practically hardware-free.andP;  Esprit puts the whole PC in the bottomof the monitor.andP;  Emerald Computer's LANStation is an unusually tiny, sleekunit with a compact keyboard and screen, such that an entire 286 can fit in abig lunch box.andP;  Try that with your hard disk.andM;Safe, Cheap, and PrettyandM;The most ballyhooed advantage of diskless PCs is security.andP;  Diskless PCs haveno local storage, not even a floppy disk drive, so nothing off the fileserver can be copied from a user's workstation.andP;  Employees can't copyextensive contact lists, sensitive data, or expensive software onto a floppyand walk away with it.andP;  Suspicious institutions, such as banks and governmentagencies, invest in diskless machines specifically for this reason.andM;Even companies, large or small, without major security concerns buy disklessPCs because they're inexpensive.andP;  They're especially cost-effective forsupport staff using the network mainly for office applications such as workprocessing.andP;  You may not care whether your employees copy Micro-soft Word offyour system, but it could make a difference financially if you don't have tooutfit every administrative assistant with his or her own hard disk.andP;  Ifyou're really concerned about cost, buy a diskless machine from a vendor whohas simply removed the hard drive from a regular-sized PC.andP;  They're evencheaper than the down-sized versions that companies such as 3Com sell.andM;Diskless PCs are less prone to failure, making them cost-effective.andP;  Harddisks, with their moving parts and vulnerable surface media, crash all thetime, bringing work to a halt.andP;  Disks can be mirrored or duplexed to preventdowntime, but it's prohibitively expensive to bring that level of faulttolerance to every local workstation.andP;  With a network of disklessworkstations, only one hard disk -- the file server's -- needs to beprotected.andM;Another advantage not to be taken lightly is the increased centralizedcontrol that comes with a network of diskless workstations.andP;  Not to accusenetwork managers of being a power-hungry bunch, but using diskless PCs canreduce the headaches caused by wayward users.andP;  In fact, the risk of anemployee walking away with data can be minimal compared with the almostconstant threat of users who fail to back up their files or maintain anorganized hard disk.andP;  With all the storage done on a file server, systemadministrators can make sure that all data is protected and unwanted filesare deleted regularly to prevent users hogging disk space.andM;Besides being a boon for network managers, diskless PCs may also make usersmore comfortable.andP;  It's easy to forget when dealing with computers that manypeople hate them or are at least skittish around them.andP;  Employees may be lessresistant to a new computer if they're assured that they're not responsiblefor its maintenance.andM;Diskless PCs also have an aesthetic advantage over their clunky counter-partswith disks.andP;  Many new designs are futuristic and come in a range of colorsfrom powder blue to graphite black, a pleasant contrast to standard,tuna-fish-colored PCs.andP;  Emerald's diskless PCs will be featured in the sequelto the film RoboCop.andP;  A smaller footprint also frees up desk space forphones, folders, and coffee cups, and even those diskless machines that arethe same size and color as a regular PC are blessedly quiet.andM;There Are DisadvantagesandM;This is not to say that any company should run out and replace all its PCswith the diskless variety.andP;  Like everything under the sun, a diskless PC hasits bad points.andM;A diskless PC is severely limited in expansion capability.andP;  whereas a regularPC has anywhere from six to 12 expansion slots, most diskless PCs have one ornone, although some have as many as eight.andP;  That means you may not be able toadd a graphics or a memory card.andP;  Although diskless PC manufacturers railagainst the fact that their products are billed as low-end workstations,their size limits the applications and features they can support.andM;Furthermore, a diskless workstation can be slower than a regular machine,although speed is an overrated issue in computing.andP;  But if you are neuroticenough to worry about the milliseconds you'll lose as data is retrieved fromthe server, a diskless machine may not be for you.andP;  If you have your heartset on a diskless but don't want to sacrifice speed, a good caching programon the server can save time.andP;  Either way, it'll still be faster than readingdata off a floppy.andM;Not to make networking a larger moral issue than it is, but in many ways adiskless PC is contrary to the philosophy of a network.andP;  There are those whosay that diskless machines are nothing more than smart terminals, and some ofthem were terminals in previous lives.andP;  Certainly, sitting at a desk, lookingat a monitor, punching away at a keyboard, and knowing that all theinformation resides elsewhere tugs at our primal memories of mainframes.andP;  Theinformation is there, but it's not ours.andP;  We simply access it, we don't ownit.andM;PC users, those who don't shrink away from a computer, are used tocontrolling their own files.andP;  We use PCs for everything from real work towriting personal letters, and a measure of privacy and safety is involved inkeeping all that information on a local disk rather than one shared by manypeople.andP;  Users may not trust a network manager not to snoop around any morethan a manager trusts users not to steal data.andP;  Nor can you be really surethat in a house-cleaning frenzy, a network manager may not inadvertentlyerase something you need.andM;On the less paranoid, more practical side, a network of diskless PCs is asvulnerable as a mainframe to downtime.andP;  If the server hard disk fails, allwork done on diskless PCs grinds to a halt.andP;  On a network of regular PCs, youcan at least continue to work, saving information to your own disk until theserver is repaired.andM;Further, with a diskless PC, you're at the mercy of the network load.andO;Several users accessing a large database at the same time from disklessworkstations can seriously degrade network performance, since all that datahas to travel across the network.andP;  With a disked PC, a user can simply takehis or her PC off the network and work as a standalone machine.andP;  Diskless PCusers have to choose between not working or working sluggishly at best.andO;Downloading the huge database to the local disk to keep network traffic lightis not an option.andM;What To Worry AboutandM;After deciding whether you want a diskless PC, you then must choose whichone.andP;  Do you want an inexpensive, full-sized box where you sacrificefunctionality and memory for price or do you want a state-of-the-artnetstation?andP;  How many expansion slots should you get?andP;  Do you want a built-innetwork interface?andP;  What about a video card?andP;  Will you supply the monitor?andO;How small do you really need it to be?andP;  What color do you want?andM;Before you leap from your desk in horror, consider your needs.andP;  If you'rebuying diskless PCs for security purposes, don't worry about how manyexpansion slots you get.andP;  In fact, the fewer the better.andP;  An extra expansionslot defeats the security aspect of a diskless machine, since a crafty usercan easily stuff a hard disk card into the PC and walk away with your data.andO;Diskless machines without built-in network interfaces and video cards simplyeliminate the problem of extra slots since you'll need one for the networkinterface card and the other for the video card.andP;  So if you trust your usersor want some extra flexibility, choose a workstation with more than twoexpansion slots.andM;Most diskless PC manufacturers are betting on the fact that users want totalsecurity, however, and build a LAN adapter and video card right into thesystem, eliminating expansion slots altogether.andP;  It's not a bad idea,especially for the not so computer-literate user.andP;  Add a boot ROM and a userhas absolutely no say in the operating system or programs loaded.andP;  The fewerdecisions end users make, the less opportunity they'll have to mess anythingup.andM;A built-in network interface has one serious drawback, not to be pooh-poohedin this ever-changing world of technology: You're stuck with it.andP;  If youchoose a machine with an Ethernet adapter, for example, you better be onemillion percent sure that you'll never want to use it on anything but anEthernet network, ever.andP;  Same thing goes for a video card, although that'sfar less crucial.andP;  Unless you're completely committed to your topology,consider a workstation with at least one expansion slot to allow you a littleflexibility.andM;What It All MeansandM;The popularity of diskless PCs may be more an indication of the changing faceof computing than their true functionality.andP;  In the 1960s and 1970s,computers meant mainframes, with tens of hundreds of users sharing oneelectronic brain.andP;  With the advent of the PC, users gained speed and autonomybut sacrificed the power and convenience of sharing information.andM;The kind of isolation inherent in PCs is contrary to the way people live andwork, especially in an office environment, so it was only a matter of timebefore those computers were networked.andP;  PC networks aren't the final answer,however.andP;  Institutions have invested in everything from mainframes to ministo PCs and would actually prefer not to sacrifice their investments as theyexpand and embrace newer technology.andM;Diskless PCs may be so popular because they allow companies to expand theiroperations over networks with a variety of equipment easily and cheaply.andO;Says Ernie Wassman, direcor of product marketing at Esprit, &quot;The bottom lineis that diskless PCs have nothing to do with low cost or security, or othermeaningless issues dreamt up by marketing people.andP;  They really have to dowith the way computing is changing, and the increased functionality theybring to the desktop.andP;  It's no longer what you can do at the desktop but whatyou can do from your desktop.&quot;andM;No one really expects diskless PCs to replace the disked variety, but they'realready an undeniable part of the equipment considered part of networking.andO;They give system designers another option when tailoring a workstation to auser's needs.andP;  Future networks will connect all levels of users fromtemporary secretaries to engineers.andP;  It will be more cost-effective,efficient, and logical to provide each level with the functionality it needs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
