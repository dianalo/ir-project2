Differences must still be resolved over language affectingprior appropriations for Pakistan and the International TradeAdministration, but the White House hopes to complete actionand win release of the money next week.</LP><TEXT>   The swift congressional action belied increased concernthat even as U.S. aid is going abroad, federal disaster fundsare running short at home. The Federal Emergency ManagementAgency said yesterday that it needs an additional $450million to cover disaster costs for the remainder of thefiscal year ending Sept. 30. Separately, no funding has yetbeen appropriated to cover agriculture losses estimated ashigh as $700 million to $900 million for the 1990 growingseason.   Both shortages reflect the pressure of new budget rulesand the legerdemain that has often followed. The DemocraticCongress failed to provide in advance for emergencies, butRepublicans are among those most forceful in demanding thatthe administration come forward with new money. Senate actionwas delayed last night as Minority Leader Robert Dole soughtto ensure disaster funding for his home state of Kansas, andSen. Thad Cochran (R., Miss.) pressured the AgricultureDepartment to relax rules on emergency disaster loans forfarmers.   In the case of FEMA, the strain is felt most directly bystate and local governments, which rely on federal assistanceto repair public roads and buildings damaged, for example, bystorms and flooding. The agency has begun to withhold fundingfor such projects in an effort to husband its resources. Andthough White House Budget Director Richard Darman is nowpromising to seek new funding, the president must eitherdeclare an emergency or find offsetting cuts from otherprograms to stay under the budget.   &quot;If FEMA doesn't do something about money, we're going tobe hard-pressed,&quot; said a state disaster official in Maine,where recent storms wiped out a bridge in the hamlet ofAllagash. &quot;People presume the United States has deep pocketsand can take care of the Kurds and Bangladesh as well asAllagash.&quot;   In fact, yesterday's relief bills are financed from acombination of prior appropriations for the Gulf war and awindfall of interest earned by the Treasury on donations byforeign nations. Among the Pentagon's allies on Capitol Hill,there is strong pressure to withdraw U.S. troops fromoccupied northern Iraq, and the estimated $320.5 millionprovided for Pentagon operations is calculated to carry themilitary only through May 31.   &quot;They'll be out by the end of this month,&quot; said Rep. JohnMurtha (D., Pa.), chairman of the House Appropriationsdefense subcommittee. But Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.), asenior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saidthis deadline will be difficult to meet unless an agreementis reached between Kurdish leaders and the Iraqi government.   State Department refugee and disaster accounts wouldreceive $235.5 million under both bills. But the Houseversion, adopted 384-25, would finance these costs in part bycutting $85 million from aid previously allocated forPakistan. Secretary of State James Baker lobbied successfullyto overturn this provision in the Senate, which chose tofinance the aid by taking all of the money from interestearned on donations by foreign nations to pay the cost of theGulf war.</TEXT></DOC>
