Sales increases for May, the first month of the retailing industry's fiscal second quarter, were one percentage point to two percentage points below the expectations of most companies, said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Industry analysts said the softer-than-expected gains indicate that consumers are curtailing spending on general merchandise for the first time this year. &quot;People paused slightly after spending aggressively for the first four months of the year,&quot; said Stacy Ruchlamer, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The chill follows the industry's strong 9% sales gain generated for March and April combined.    The nation's largest retailer, Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. said its May sales for domestic stores open at least one year rose 1.9%. Same-store sales for Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. rose 0.9%.    Montgomery Ward andamp; Co.'s 2.5% rise in same-store sales was the slowest growth rate for the Mobil Corp. unit since fall. Sales were hurt by the chain's recent move out of the hardware and the lawn and garden lines, which typically are big sellers in May. Bernard F. Brennan, Ward's chief executive officer, also cited a softening of consumer demand in the oil-patch states. &quot;May was slightly below plan,&quot; he said.    The nation's second-largest retailer, Troy, Mich.-based K mart Corp., said same-store sales for its U.S. and Canadian stores rose 3.6% for May. &quot;It was slightly below expectations,&quot; said Thomas F. Murasky, K mart's chief financial officer. &quot;There was probably a slight pause in May, but things will pick up.&quot;    Most analysts, however, said May's results signal a slowing of retail sales in the second quarter. Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst for Merrill Lynch Research andamp; Economics, said he expects industrywide sales to grow about 6% during the second quarter and 5.5% to 6% in the second half. Despite the slowing sales gains, Mr. Feiner said he expects profits to rise. He cited lower rates under the new tax law and tight control of expenses.    Two retailers reported healthy May gains. Same-store sales rose 10.7% for New York-based J.C. Penney Co. and 12% for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc.    Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. said its 6.4% rise for May same-store sales paced its results so far this year. Same-store May sales rose 3.9% for St. Louis-based May Department Stores Co. and 4% for the Bradlees discount store unit of Boston-based Stop andamp; Shop Cos.    Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores Inc. said total May general merchandise sales rose 4.6%.    Clothes continued to be the strongest product line for retailers in May. However, some stores are worried that a recent surge in the cost of imported apparel will repel consumers later in the year. &quot;I think consumers will resist any price increases,&quot; said Edward J. Galm, senior vice president, finance, for Indianapolis-based Paul Harris Stores Inc.    F.W. Woolworth Co., which reported a 6.2% rise in total U.S. May sales, expects apparel prices to increase 8% to 10% late this year and early next year. &quot;It's a serious thing,&quot; said Harold E. Sells, chairman and chief executive of New York-based Woolworth.    The cost of clothes sold in the U.S. is rising because the Reagan administration is restricting imports of apparel from Asia, retailers said. The U.S. is attempting to slow the growth of imports from Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan to less than 1% for 1987, said Robin Lanier, a lobbyist for the National Retail Merchants Association.    The restrictions boosted the price index for imported apparel 9.1% in March over March 1986, said Thomas Emrich, a partner in Washington, D.C.-based Trade Resources Co.    Most retailers don't expect the full brunt of the import squeeze to hurt their sales until later this year. But there are already signs that imports are driving up the overall price of apparel. After rising less than 3% in 1985 and 1986, the apparel consumer price index jumped 4% during the first four months of this year, said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University.    For the first time since at least 1970, the cost of apparel is rising faster than the general inflation rate, said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Management Horizons, a Columbus, Ohio, retail consulting firm. &quot;That is a strong sign that apparel volume has got to drop.&quot;    Among other retailers: Same-store May sales rose 6% for Rocky Hill, Conn.-based Ames Department Stores Inc., 4.4% for Wilmington, Del.-based Mercantile Stores Co., 12% for Bloomington, Minn.-based Best Buy Co., 4% for Kansas City, Mo.-based Payless Cashways Inc. and 17% for Richmond, Va.-based Circuit City Stores Inc.    Total May sales rose 3.7% for Richmond, Va.-based Best Products Co. and 19.4% for Chicago-based Carson Pirie Scott andamp; Co.    ---                     Four-week May period                             a-'87 sales  '86 sales    b-%                               millions    millions   change   Sears ..................... 2,009.8    1,970.6    + 2.0   f-K mart .................. 1,936.4    1,790.3    + 8.2   Wal-Mart .................. 1,281.0      952.0    +35   J.C.
