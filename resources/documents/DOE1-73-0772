In this paper, two approaches are followed: the first,a parametric one, consists in presenting a set of equations in whichthe axial temperature depends on various parameters, mo, TNa, do, x...- the second, a phenomenological one, calls for a pseudo-homogenous jetmodel which describes the rate of gas axial presence, its evolution beingsimilar to that of temperatures in a reactive jet. Furthermore, to takeinto account the pressure of the gas injected into the liquid, a pseudoinjector bore is used, which takes into account the expansive effectof the gas. These two approaches enable one to account for 700 experimentalpoints, each with a global correlation index close to 0.8.</TEXT></DOC>
