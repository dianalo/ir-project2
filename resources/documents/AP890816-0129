LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Afghanistan's defense minister onWednesday accused the United States and Pakistan of organizing amajor guerrilla offensive to overthrow Kabul's Marxist government.   Defense Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai, in an unusual interview withWestern reporters, also said fighting in the 11-year-old civil warhad died down across most of the country in recent months despitewhat he described as ``newer, heavier, and more sophisticated'' U.S.arms provided to the guerrillas.   Tanai also said the Moslem guerrillas fighting to overthrow theSoviet-backed government of President Najib were feuding amongthemselves and could never be united under a single command.   Asked about reports of a new guerrilla offensive, he said: ``Onthe basis of information acquired from different sources, theAmericans, Pakistanis and Saudis are making strenuous efforts toamass a huge force from among all opposition groups to launch amajor offensive with the hope of a military victory.''   He did not say when he expected it to begin or provide any otherdetails, however.   ``I'm also of the opinion that the problems of Afghanistan shouldbe settled through peaceful means, and there is no possibility ofthe military solution of the problem,'' Tanai said.   He added that the Soviet Union was ready to stop supplyingweapons to Afghanistan if the United States, Pakistan, and SaudiArabia halted arms shipments to the guerrillas.   The United States and the Soviet Union have accused each other ofescalating the arms race in this poverty-stricken nation of 10million people.   Washington says the Soviets have nearly doubled their weaponsshipments to Kabul since they pulled their last troops fromAfghanistan in February. It says the Soviets are providing up to $3billion in weapons annually.   Last week, Afghanistan said the Soviets had begun to supplyingMiG-29 fighters and the latest Sukhoi-27 ground-attack jets.   Washington has promised the guerrillas new weapons to attackairport runways and counter high-altitude bombing attacks by theAfghan air force.   Despite the reported arms shipments, Tanai said there had been anoverall reduction in fighting by the guerrillas, except in provincesbordering Pakistan. The seven most powerful guerrilla groups arebased there.   Tanai also said that since the Soviet pullout, leaders of thePakistani-based guerrillas, who formed an interimgovernment-in-exile, have lost much of their control over guerrillafield commanders.   He said they were becoming increasingly isolated because of theirgrowing identification with foreign powers.   ``I am of the opinion opposition groups can never have a regularorganization, and they can never be used under a single command.This is the result of the shattering blows of the armed forces ...which led to severe differences among them,'' he said.   Though reputed to be a hard-liner, the general said he supportedNajib's policy of bringing all warring factions into a broad-basedcoalition and creating a neutral, demilitarized Afghanistan.   He said the Afghan government has confounded Western predictionsit would fall quickly without Soviet troops.   ``The armed forces ... proved in the last six months that theycan independently and alone eliminate the opposition groups insidethe country,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
