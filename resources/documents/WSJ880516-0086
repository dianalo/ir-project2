David Winterhalter, NASA's director of systems engineering and analysis, said teams from the two agencies would meet with potential suppliers today and Wednesday in Washington. Among the alternatives being considered, Mr. Winterhalter said, is whether the government should finance the construction of a new plant.    Royce Mitchell, head of NASA's solid-rocket motor program in Huntsville, Ala., said that NASA has looked at buying the ingredient from abroad, but said the &quot;world-wide capacity is very small&quot; and couldn't satisfy U.S. needs by itself.    Kerr-McGee Corp. said it closed down the nation's only remaining facility for making the ingredient, ammonium perchlorate, after the governor of Nevada requested a special safety investigation.    Kerr-McGee said an independent investigation of the plant's safety might begin as soon as today, and said production wouldn't resume until the operation is declared safe. A spokesman said the company hopes production can be resumed in a few days.    The only other U.S. plant that made the chemical, an oxidizer that is mixed with a propellant to make solid rocket fuel, was leveled by explosion May 4. That facility, owned by American Engineering andamp; Production Co., was in Henderson, Nev., as is the Kerr-McGee plant.    A long delay in resuming production could affect plans to return the space shuttle to regular operations, officials said, and could also push some scheduled military launchings and missile deployments into next year.    Mr. Winterhalter said the facility &quot;couldn't be shut for very long without it starting to affect us.&quot; NASA has said it has enough of the chemical on hand for the first four shuttle launches.    The Pentagon also expressed some concern about the latest shutdown. The military relies on the facility to provide solid fuel for some of its most important missiles and rockets, including the MX intercontinental missile, the Delta and Titan rockets, and the Harpoon anti-ship missile.    At the moment, the Pentagon has enough fuel for three Delta and three Titan launches, and for the rocket motors of the remaining MX missiles scheduled for deployment, as well as for more Harpoon missiles. If the plant is shut down for a long time, however, launch schedules and missile deployments could be pushed into next year. A Pentagon spokesman said the plant should begin producing solid fuel this summer to meet next year's needs.    After the explosion two weeks ago, Kerr-McGee stopped producing the chemical for about a week. It resumed production after company officials determined the plant was safe.    Kerr-McGee said it will continue making magnesium dioxide and other chemicals at the plant, which employs about 250 people. If the shutdown is prolonged, Kerr-McGee said it might have to lay off about 35 workers.    ---   Tim Carrington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
