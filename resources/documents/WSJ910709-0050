The Tokyo debacle sent stock prices reeling on almost allthe major Asian exchanges, and shares sank broadly on the bigEuropean bourses, which also were pressured by earlyfaltering on Wall Street.</LP><TEXT>   In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei average of 225 stockscontinued to fall, reversing a brief opening upswing and thenplummeting. At the close of the morning session, the indexwas down 412.25 points to 21763.92 -- well below the22000-point level some technical analysts believe is acrucial support level.   Stock-index futures were offer-only -- meaning there wereno buyers -- and market participants said they worry that theauthorities won't step in to shore up the market because oflingering anger over a recent stock-market scandal.   &quot;The market remains extremely lousy,&quot; said Amy Yip, asaleswoman at Baring Securities Ltd. &quot;It's a horriblesituation.&quot;   Tuesday morning's loss compounds a drop Monday of 722.17points, or 3.15%, to 22176.17, the indicator's lowest closinglevel since it finished at 21862.61 on Dec. 4, 1990. Thebenchmark indicator has now declined for four sessions in arow and and has lost 1,210.42 points, or 5.2%, its steepestdecline since a two-step crash last year that, at its worst,wiped out 48% of the market's value.   Declining stocks on the first section Monday overwhelmedadvancing issues 95833. Only 60 stocks were unchanged. Volumewas moderate at about 300 million shares, up from 243.5million shares Friday.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all firstsection issues plummeted 53.32 points, or 2.99%, to 1729.91.   &quot;Concern about the scandals has hung on much longer thanpeople anticipated,&quot; said Kathy Matsui, an analyst at Barclayde Zoette Wedd Securities Ltd., referring to the Japanesesecurities industry scandal. &quot;There's a feeling that there'smore bad news yet to come out.&quot;   Some market participants now worry that the Nikkei mayfall further, perhaps below its 20000-point low of last year,which means the market would have failed to establish anupward trend and might be on a longer-term decline. Such adecline also could trigger waves of selling by Japan's biginstitutional investors -- banks, insurance companies andpension funds -- which might become anxious to preserve anycapital gains before the market tumbles again.   The market on Monday got caught in a vicious circle, inwhich declines in stock prices simply accelerated furtherselling by investors who had purchased stock with borrowedmoney. The steady declines in stock prices over the past weekhave lowered the value of these so-called margin investors'collateral, requiring them to place additional deposits tomaintain their holdings. Now the financial burden and thedimming chance of financial gains are spurring theseinvestors to liquidate their positions and cut their losses.   &quot;If it falls much further, that would be a big technicalworry,&quot; said Jason James, a strategist at James Capel andamp; Co.,though he is recommending that his clients buy at currentlevels, because he believes the market is &quot;technicallyoversold,&quot; in relation to Japanese government bond yields.   But most investors appeared to ignore technicalindicators, favoring the swirling rumors and uneasiness ofscandal. Market players were unnerved by expectations thatJapan's powerful Finance Ministry would mete out punishmentsagainst the so-called Big Four brokerage houses, whichdominate the country's securities industry, for their rolesin a scandal that erupted last month. The presidents of twoof the firms, Nomura Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co.,resigned amid allegations that the firms did business withgangsters and improperly paid compensation to favored clientswho otherwise would have incurred losses in stock and bondtrading. The other two Big Four firms are Yamaichi SecuritiesCo. and Daiwa Securities Co.   By Monday's stock-trading close, shortly before FinanceMinister Ryutaro Hashimoto disclosed a four-day suspension ofinstitutional sales and corporate dealing at Nomura andNikko, many brokers were ready for the worst.   &quot;We can't know if this is the end,&quot; said a trader at a BigFour firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity in the wake ofthe scandal. &quot;It could go lower.&quot;   A senior analyst at another Big Four firm, who alsoinsisted on not being identified, outlined a gloomy scenarioin which the Nikkei average could fall as low as 17000.&quot;We're still high, we're still expensive vis-a-vis the periodbefore 1986,&quot; the analyst said. Between 1986 and 1989,interest rates in Japan were at historic lows, money waseasy, and stock and property prices surged to all-time highs,in what monetary authorities now call the &quot;bubble economy.&quot;   &quot;There is still some bubble to burst,&quot; the analyst said.   He predicted that the Bank of Japan might be forced torepeat last week's half-percentage-point reduction inofficial interest rates, which brought the discount rate --the amount the central bank charges on loans to financialinstitutions -- to 5.5%. It was the first credit easing bythe Bank of Japan since February 1987, or since the bank inMay 1989 began a tight-money policy aimed at quashing thebubble economy.   Another worry that the stock market's decline has revivedis that Japan's giant banks might not be able to meetimpending international capital requirements. The rules,imposed at the urging of the Bank for InternationalSettlements, require banks to maintain capital roughlyequivalent to 8% of their total assets as of the start oftheir 1993 fiscal years, or April 1, 1992, in Japan.   If the Nikkei index falls below the 22000point level, someanalysts said, it could bring Japan's banks below thatcapital-to-assets level and force them to cut back on lendingto curb their asset size -- or to sell some of their vaststockholdings to raise fresh capital. &quot;If it falls to 21000,it could be a big problem&quot; said James Capel's Mr. James.   Elsewhere, nervousness in Sydney about Japanese stocksleft Australian stock prices 0.7% lower. Hong Kong stockssnapped a six-day rally, as sharp early gains wereoverwhelmed by profit-taking. Singapore equities slid beforerebounding slightly just before the session ended. Taipei'sdecline was the eighth in the past nine sessions. But inSeoul, share prices rose sharply on market optimism aboutimproving local liquidity conditions.   In Europe, London shares weakened in exceptionally thindealings, partly from concerns about Tokyo's big drop, thoughrumors of a bounce Tuesday in Tokyo equities helped lift theLondon market off its lows. The Financial Times-StockExchange 100-share index dropped 17.9 points to 2466.8. TheFT 30-stock index declined 20.5 points to 1891.3. Volume was308.4 million shares, compared with 489.6 million sharesFriday.   Frankfurt's DAX index fell 13.87 points to 1605.04.Dealings were thin in precautionary selling ahead of theThursday policy session -- the last before a summer break --of Germany's central bank, which might raise the discountrate. Yet most of the selling in Frankfurt was attributed toshort-term speculators' unloading stocks in hopes ofreacquiring them soon at lower prices. Elsewhere in Europe,Brussels's Bel-20 Index slipped to an all-time low since itsfirst quote on the exchange in March.   Among corporate developments, in London, Imperial ChemicalIndustries rose 4 pence to #12.80 ($20.72), and Hanson fell 2to 200.50 pence. ICI rose on a warning by its merchantbankers that the chemical giant's breakup value could be ashigh as #22 a share. The valuation was said to be an attemptto put ICI beyond the reach of Hanson, a conglomerate thatacquired a 2.8% stake in ICI in May.   In Frankfurt, Daimler-Benz declined 5.50 marks to 743marks ($407.02). Continuing its effort to diversify intoelectronics, the industrial concern is negotiating thepurchase of 34% of Sogeti of France, an unlisted holdingcompany that owns 58% of Europe's largest computer-servicesgroup, Cap Gemini Sogeti. A price wasn't disclosed, butbuying the stake could cost Daimler at least an estimated2.72 billion French francs ($439.8 million). In Paris, CapGemini shares surged 10.60 francs, or 3.4%, to 321 francs($51.90).
