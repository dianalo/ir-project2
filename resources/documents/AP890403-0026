The court, by a 7-2 vote, upheld a policy limiting the power ofa single board member to place an item on the agenda for boardmeetings.   Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia dissented, saying thecourt should hear oral arguments in the case before deciding it.   The school board in Victoria, Texas, has seven members. Since1984, five board members have been elected from single-memberdistricts and two in at-large voting.   Theresa Gutierrez became the first and only Mexican-Americanelected to the school board in 1985. She represents a district witha 51.4 percent Hispanic population and a 14 percent blackpopulation.   The school board in 1987 changed its policy for placing items onmeeting agendas. The new policy says the school board president mayrequire the approval of two board members _ also called trustees _before an item can be added to the agenda for an upcoming meeting.   Mrs. Gutierrez and others in her district said the new policyaffects the rights of voters she represents by reducing her powerto recommend agenda items.   She said the federal Voting Rights Act requires that the U.S.attorney general approve the policy before it can be implemented.   But a three-judge federal court last year ruled against Ms.Gutierrez and her constitutents.   The federal court said the new policy's ``effect on the powersof the elected trustees was at most minuscule.''   The three-judge court compared the policy to the standardparliamentary procedure that requires someone to second any motionor resolution before it can be submitted to a vote.   ``It seems plain to us that if Mrs. Gutierrez is unable topersuade even one other trustee to join her in placing a matter onthe board's agenda, she would have no better succeess in procuringa second should she have moved it at a meeting,'' the federal courtsaid.   Also, the federal court said the policy ``in no way singles herout for unfavorable procedural treatment.''   The case is Rojas vs. Victoria Independent School District,87-2118.</TEXT></DOC>
