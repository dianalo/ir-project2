Two kinds ofvascular imaging methods were used: the conventional spin-echo sequenceand the sequence subtraction techniques. MR imaging was particularlyuseful for the diagnosis of vascular diseases such as cerebral aneurysms,cerebral arteriovenous malformations, aortic aneurysms, aortic dissections,arterial occlusive diseases, and so on. The authors' clinical studiesare reported and compared with the results of other medical imaging modalities.Furthermore, recent data on the fast imaging techniques are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
