This type of researchhas been hampered in maize because (i) maize is a cross pollinating cropand highly heterozygous and (ii) embryogenesis and plant regenerationof plants from in-vitro culture have been difficult. In the present study,carefully designed and elaborated experiments were conducted using aninbred line CH1 31 which is capable of somatic embryogenesis for thesubject of mutagenesis and another line Bu 8Ro/sub 2/ for the test crosspartner. Results showed: 1) Both the regeneration of plants from in-vitroculture and gamma-irradiation induced a similar spectrum of morphologicalvariation. Although the variation with somaclones was more frequent thatradiation induced mutations under the conditions used, combination ofexplant irradiation and in-vitro culture gave the highest frequenciesof genetic variation. 2) Some of the mutations in quantitative characterscan be recogned in heterozygous state. 3) Mutation can cause variationin combining ability (extent of heterosis). 4) Efficiency at embryogenesisdiffers with genotypes of maize. 3 refs, 11 figs, 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
