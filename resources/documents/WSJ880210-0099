It starts with a collage of scenes of Wall Street and growing families. It is hosted by NBC-TV correspondent Bob Berkowitz, is loaded with financial planning advice and features interviews with reporters from the New York Times, Forbes, and Money magazine.    But &quot;Planning Your Financial Future,&quot; a six-part series running on Financial News Network, is actually a three-hour commercial for The New England, a Boston-based insurance and financial services company. The New England paid the reporters $1,000 apiece for their time. It paid Financial News Network tens of thousands of dollars for air time, sinking a total of $365,000 into the series and its promotion. And it helped determine the content, which talks a lot about commission-generating investments, like insurance, while barely mentioning things that financial planners don't sell, like home ownership.    Now, the slick program is raising an outcry from some media industry executives. &quot;The viewer deserves to know . . . that the shows . . . are paid commercials,&quot; said an editorial in Jack O'Dwyer's Newsletter, a weekly publication for the public-relations industry. &quot;A sign, in large readable type, should be visible throughout the entire half-hour stating that the sponsor is The New England.&quot;    Osborn Elliott, the former dean of Columbia University's journalism school, is even more troubled by the fact that journalists were paid to appear on what basically is a commercial. &quot;No. 1, they shouldn't do it. And No. 2, (if they do) it should be revealed that that is the arrangement,&quot; he says. &quot;That's a fine line across which one shouldn't pass.&quot;    Executives at The New England staunchly defend the series, the last part of which airs tonight before repeating again in April. They insist that the programs aren't commercials. &quot;Our show provides objective, unbiased financial planning,&quot; says a spokesman. He notes that the show doesn't name any of the company's products and, in fact, talks about some products that The New England doesn't sell, like liability insurance. He adds that only about 50% of the financial planners affiliated with the company work on commission anyway; the others work for a fee.    The series brings up yet again the controversy over paid programming, which can blur the line between news and advertising. Plenty of companies other than The New England also create paid programming; Financial News Network runs about two hours of it a day, and other cable and independent TV stations rely on it, too.    &quot;It's mixing advertising and news in a way that should never be done,&quot; contends Richard Salant, former president of CBS News. &quot;FNN has a real problem there. You have to go to the most elaborate lengths in television to separate out what is news and what is advertising.&quot;    Particularly controversial in this case is the use of journalists-supposedly objective, unbiased observers. That raises the &quot;credibility question,&quot; says Mr. Salant. &quot;If this is something that is paid for by advertisers, you can't really believe that it is independent news judgment.&quot; Indeed, Gary Klott, a tax reporter for the New York Times who appears on one segment, says he wouldn't do it again.    &quot;If anybody is questioning the appearance of conflict, there's just no reason to go through that,&quot; Mr. Klott says. He adds that he agreed to do the show because it appeared to be affiliated with Financial News Network, it was using a network correspondent as anchor, and it seemed &quot;to have an independent tone to it. I was not aware that this is a commercial.&quot;    New York Times reporter Leonard Sloane, who also appears on the show, couldn't be reached for comment. But Allan M. Siegel, assistant managing editor at the Times, says the paper's conflict-of-interest policy states that &quot;staff members may not work for or contribute to projects associated with or commissioned by news sources of the Times.&quot; He refused to comment further. (The Wall Street Journal's policy would prevent a reporter from appearing on paid programming.)    At Money magazine, senior writer Richard Eisenberg, who appears on a segment titled &quot;Protecting Your Assets,&quot; at first defends the program. &quot;None of us were selling anything for The New England, none of us mentioned The New England, and a lot of what I said was opposite what New England people would tell you to do,&quot; he says. &quot;We had complete free range to say anything we wanted.&quot;    But Money's managing editor, Landon Jones, calls later, saying, &quot;Our policy, which I will quickly articulate to the staff, is that we can't do that.&quot; He says Money never had a policy on paid programming because its reporters were never involved in it before. He adds: &quot;I'm not sure if Rich fully realized the paid nature of the program. At FNN, it's ambiguous, I guess, who is really producing the show. Is it the news unit or some paid sponsor?&quot;    William Flanagan, a senior editor at Forbes who is featured in one segment, couldn't be reached for comment.    Financial News Network plays down the controversy. Network executives point out that the show is preceded and followed by a disclaimer that notes The New England's role in the show and that states that Financial News Network &quot;does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or objectivity of the information presented.&quot;    &quot;It's our version of (newspapers') advertising supplements,&quot; says Mike Wheeler, executive vice president and general manager of business news. &quot;Would newspapers like to do away with their advertising supplements? Probably not.&quot;    In fact, Mr. Wheeler praises The New England's efforts. &quot;It's one of the best programs we have ever aired,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
