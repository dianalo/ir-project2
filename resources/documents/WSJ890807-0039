Analysts generally attribute the bearish tone in oil markets to a summer surge in production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and to new sluggishness in demand.    Similar developments a year ago led to a plunge of $4 a barrel in four months in the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. But despite the similarity, few expect a repetition of the price break that dropped the U.S. benchmark crude to less than $13 a barrel in 1988.    &quot;We are off $2-plus from recent levels, and we could go off a little more, but not more than $1 a barrel,&quot; said Paul Mlotok, oil industry analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., New York.    Before the recent slide began in July, West Texas Intermediate was near $20 a barrel. In futures trading last week, the September contract for the crude oil closed at $18.03 a barrel. Also on Friday, some refiners reduced their field-price postings 25 cents a barrel to $17.25.    Many analysts agree that prices would have been even lower if the oil markets hadn't drawn support from the political situation in Lebanon. That was based largely on fears that possible U.S. military action against Iran linked to the fate of U.S. hostages in Lebanon would disrupt Persian Gulf oil exports.    The fading of the &quot;hostage premium&quot; -- as some analysts describe this effect -- from the oil market will direct attention back to the industry's fundamentals, which appear to be deteriorating.    Although the International Energy Agency estimates that world oil consumption this year will average 52.1 million barrels a day, 2.4% more than in 1988, growth in demand appears to be slowing. At the same time, &quot;heavy OPEC production is weighing on the market,&quot; says Peter Gignoux, manager of the international energy desk for Shearson Lehman Hutton in London.    OPEC pumped out more than 21 million barrels a day in the second quarter of this year and is expected to continue to exceed its second-half production quota of 19.5 million barrels a day. Some output cuts were expected in this quarter in the wake of new promises from quota violators at the June meeting of OPEC oil ministers. Instead, by most accounts, output continues to rise and is now near 21.4 million barrels a day.    &quot;Political maneuvering ahead of OPEC's next meeting on Sept. 23 in Geneva could drive output even higher in the next two months,&quot; according to OPEC Listener. These persistently high volumes, the oil-industry analysis service says, &quot;are pushing world oil markets to the brink of a surplus, with falling prices pointing to higher stocks and weaker fundamentals.&quot;    Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:    Grains and Soybeans    The weather and a major Agriculture Department crop report due Thursday will continue to dominate trading this week. So far, conditions have been nearly ideal for the maturing corn and soybean crops in large parts of the Farm Belt. Many traders will be watching a crop forecast by Conrad Leslie, a private grain analyst in Chicago, for further price signals. The Leslie forecast is set for release after the markets close tomorrow. Traders had been expecting a corn crop of 7.5 billion to 7.7 billion bushels, which would be 52% to 56% bigger than last year's drought-ravaged harvest. But Sparks Commodities Inc. in Memphis, Tenn., last week predicted a harvest of only 7.35 billion bushels, a forecast that helped the grain markets rebound Friday. Corn, wheat and soybean futures all rose as many traders covered short, or selling, positions. After the markets closed, the National Weather Service predicted relatively cool weather and normal rainfall next week in much of the Corn Belt.    Copper    Copper traders enter the week with great uncertainty as to where prices are headed. On the one hand, supplies are tightening when they normally would be showing a seasonal increase; on the other, a major producer could soon be back in business and helping to alleviate that tightness. Negotiations at Highland Valley in British Columbia, a major Canadian mine where workers have been on strike since July 9, reportedly made significant progress late last week. One analyst forecast that the negotiations will be the focus of traders' attention early in the week, and he said there appears to be a good chance the strike will end this week. He said traders already have factored an early end to the strike into the copper market. However, this analyst said, the reopening of the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, which had been expected to take place late this month or early in September, may have been set back by a renewal of the attacks by rebel landowners that caused the mine to close May 15. Copper supplies in warehouses of the London Metal Exchange, which last Monday were reported to have risen for the first time in 10 weeks, are believed to have increased by a further 2,000 to 5,000 tons last week, the analyst said. Thereafter, however, inventories are expected to resume their decline as anticipatory buying for the fall's needs begins. Another indication of the uncertainty among traders, the analyst said, is that the September futures contract last week topped $1.14 a pound three times only to fall back as selling developed. </TEXT></DOC>
