It was only the second time in its history that the UAWpostponed a walkout after the expiration of a Big Threecontract. In 1987, the union extended its contract with FordMotor Co. for three days before reaching agreement.</LP><TEXT>   This time, the UAW agreed to keep talking with GM despitefailing to reach agreement by the deadline on its No. 1issue: job security for its 310,000 active and laid-off GMmembers.   The union said it would continue working under the currentcontract on a day-to-day basis. Union leaders told GM membersto report for their regular shifts until further notice. Butboth sides clearly hoped to reach a settlement by thismorning.   &quot;We're inching along,&quot; UAW spokesman Frank Joyce saidyesterday afternoon. Top bargaining officials have kept atight lid on information about the talks, declining even togive specific progress reports to local union leaders who areexpected to inform the rank and file. &quot;Information has beentight,&quot; said Robert Roman, an official of the 8,000-memberUAW unit in Flint, Mich., that represents GM's sprawlingBuick City auto complex. &quot;I've never seen it like this in my25 years of bargaining.&quot;   In any case, pressure is mounting on top UAW bargainers toreach an agreement that has stronger job security protectionsthan the current pact, or to spearhead a strike.   The UAW's national bargaining council -- composed of localunion leaders from around the country -- is scheduled to meethere this morning to discuss the union's options. If there isno settlement, union officials could decide to keep talkingwithout a strike, go ahead with a nationwide walkout, or callstrikes at a few strategic GM plants that produce importantvehicles or parts.   The UAW's decision to postpone a strike, despite the lackof agreement on the crucial job-security question,illustrates the dilemma the union faces as it tries to stopfurther job losses at GM.   In the past, when the UAW controlled virtually all U.S.auto production, the union didn't hesitate to call for awalkout if talks dragged on past a strike deadline. But now,Japanese auto makers have eight U.S. factories -- five ofthem non-union -- that would continue pumping out cars andtrucks if UAW members walked out. Ford and Chrysler Corp.plants also would keep working.   This glut of car-making capacity in the U.S. means saleslost during a strike would likely be lost for good,undermining the very GM jobs the UAW is seeking to protect.   The job security issue is both complex and critical to thefutures of both the UAW and GM.   The union wants GM to guarantee jobs, or continued pay,for all its current UAW workers. UAW leaders have been stungduring the past three years as GM moved to close six U.S.assembly factories, despite language in the current UAW-GMagreement that was supposed to forbid permanent plantshutdowns.   But GM has been reluctant to extend job guarantees to itsentire current workforce. That's because the No. 1 auto makerneeds to cut as many as 60,000 jobs from its blue-collarpayrolls in North America to match the productivity levels ofits rivals, company officials say.   Instead of blanket job guarantees, GM is understood tohave offered sweeter pensions to encourage more UAW membersto retire. The company also has pushed for relaxation ofcontract language that forces it to replace one of every twoUAW workers who leave. UAW leaders, however, are reluctant toaccept such a package, because it could lead to an exodus ofactive members.   While a strike would make it harder to resolve thesedelicate issues, union leaders could come under pressure toset a firm strike deadline if no deal is struck beforerank-and-file members stream back to GM plants this morning.   Top UAW officials already are feeling some heat frombelow. In response to pressure from dissident members, theunion said it will provide members with a complete copy ofany tentative agreement before a ratification vote. Normally,the process of getting the contract approved by themembership takes about two weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
