Traders and analysts suggested that the coming anniversary of last year's crash is heightening the cautiousness with which investors have approached the market for some time.    Prices closed near their session highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 7.29 to 2140.47. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.91 to 276.41, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index went up 0.41 to 155.87.    But by the time the market began its upturn in the afternoon, trading activity had slowed to a near-crawl, and it stayed that way through the close. Only 119,290,000 shares changed hands on the Big Board, well below Friday's total of 160,240,000.    In addition, the broad market didn't turn in quite as strong a showing as the averages. There were 749 issues advancing in price on the New York Stock Exchange, while 669 declined.    &quot;The market in general just appears kind of lethargic. Caution seems to be the byword,&quot; said Richard Roslund, a vice president of block trading at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    Noting that the market has been sluggish recently in advance of major economic reports, Mr. Roslund said, &quot;maybe now we're waiting for Oct. 19 to pass.&quot; On that date, it will be exactly one year since the Dow Jones industrials plummeted a record 508 points.    Analysts generally remain cautious in their assessment of the prospects for stocks. Many view the 2200 level on the Dow Jones industrials -- or possibly just above that -- as the high point for any advances in the market over the short run.    Alan Shaw, senior vice president in charge of technical research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said market activity will have to increase substantially for stocks to make further progress. &quot;Volume is the weapon of the bull,&quot; he said.    He said two other problems must also be resolved if the market is to move higher:   --The inability of market breadth -- the relationship between advancing and declining issues -- to keep pace with gains in the major averages.    --The absence of any clear-cut market leadership from specific sectors &quot;other than this eclectic behavior we've been seeing, which has a lot of portfolio managers stymied.&quot;    There isn't any indication at this point that these situations are going to change for the better, Mr. Shaw said, which suggests that the market is likely to be characterized by further inactivity. &quot;Everyone's just waiting for that great opportunity to develop,&quot; he said.    Alfred E. Goldman, a market analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St. Louis, said the market once again is suffering from an absence of buying for investment purposes. Instead, activity is being dominated by &quot;game playing,&quot; with trading tied to takeover rumors in the forefront.    Even so, Mr. Goldman said the upward momentum generated during the market's recent advance, firmness in the bond market and indications that Vice President George Bush will win the November presidential election suggest that stock prices will rise going into the voting next month.    The Dow Jones industrials are likely to peak just above the 2200 level and then turn lower again after the election, he said. &quot;I don't sense Armageddon,&quot; he added, &quot;but I would certainly keep my cash reserves above average and keep my expectations, as far as the stock market is concerned, below average.&quot;    International Business Machines buoyed the Dow Jones industrials by rising 1 3/8 to 121 1/8. Other gainers among blue-chip issues included Philip Morris, which added 1 3/8 to 100; Texaco, which rose 7/8 to 45 1/8; and F.W. Woolworth, which went up 1/2 to 55 1/4.    Conversely, Sears Roebuck dropped 7/8 to 40 1/8. The company has signaled that the third quarter will mark its third consecutive decline in quarterly earnings this year, casting doubt on its ability to deliver the higher profits for the year that it had forecast.    Hospital Corp. of America, which rejected a management group buy-out offer valued at $51 a share, gained 3/4 to 49 in Big Board composite trading of 2.3 million shares. The company said &quot;other parties,&quot; which it didn't identify, had provided written notice that they may be willing to make a higher offer. Separately, the company posted net income of $53.8 million for the third quarter, compared with a $232.8 million loss a year ago that included various restructuring charges.    Mead went up 1 3/8 to 45 3/8 on composite volume of 1.4 million shares as another burst of takeover speculation hit the stock. A recurring rumor that British investor Sir James Goldsmith is planning a bid for the company fueled the activity.    Interco climbed 1 5/8 to 71 1/2 on news that an investor group led by the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C., sweetened its takeover bid to $74 a share from $70.    American President rose 7/8 to 32 1/2. The company began a &quot;Dutch auction&quot; tender offer under which it will buy back up to four million common shares at a set price of $31 to $34 a share.    Unisys skidded 1 3/8 to 28 5/8 and NCR fell 7/8 to 57, although their third-quarter results met analysts' estimates. Net income at Unisys rose to 77 cents a share from 68 cents a year earlier, while NCR posted net of $1.26 a share, up from $1.05.    Corning Glass Works, whose third-quarter earnings jumped to $2.74 a share from $1.08 a year ago, gained 1 1/4 to 63 5/8. The results for the latest quarter include gains amounting to $1.32 a share from the sale of some of the company's Japanese interests.    GATX rose 2 to 49 3/4. Chairman James J. Glasser said that the company expects to report third-quarter earnings Tuesday that are 35% to 40% higher than a year earlier, when the company recorded net of $9.1 million, or 95 cents a share.    The American Stock Exchange index gained 0.72 to 303.27. Volume totaled 9,020,000 shares, up from 8,350,000 Friday. There were 267 issues advancing and 280 declining Arctic Alaska Fisheries plunged 3 3/8 to 9 5/8 after saying its third-quarter results will be near or below break-even. In the year-ago third quarter, the company earned $1.3 million, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $15.5 million.    Iroquois Brands dropped 1 1/8 to 17 1/8. The company confirmed that it is in merger talks with Bio International. Iroquois also said it will pay $7.6 million in cash and stock for an unidentified electronic component distributor.    Lorimar Telepictures fell 1/4 to 12 1/8 after agreeing in principle to a reduction in the number of shares that Warner Communications will issue in its takeover of the company. Warner rose 3/8 to 37 1/8 on the Big Board. </TEXT></DOC>
