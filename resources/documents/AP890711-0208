Nowadays, the 31-year-old Dutch lawyer is legal adviser to theNetherlands branch of a large American company.   ``If anyone would have told me that back in 1982, I would havethrown him out of the house,'' Leenheer said prior to PresidentBush's 24-hour visit to the Netherlands on Monday.   Leenheer's radical about-face mirrors the Dutch public's oftensimultaneous adulation and condemnation of the United States, thisnation's most important ally, a major trading partner and itscultural idol.   ``Either we tend to see the United States as the font of allevil, or we think in patronizing terms of endearment in the senseof, `Oh well, those Americans ...','' said Johan Lammers, aprofessor of modern American history at Leiden University.   ``We're apparently unable to perceive of the Unites States asjust a nation, albeit a powerful nation.''   In three decades, Dutch public opinion has been drenched by justas many waves of anti-American sentiment, although Lammers observedthat those feelings ``have always been superficial.'' Throughoutthose public mood swings, the various Dutch governments have stayeda staunch friend and ally of the United States, if not an advocateof all its foreign policy positions.   In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dutch police fought pitchedbattles with students protesting U.S. involvement in the VietnamWar. In 1968, several demonstrators were sentenced to two-week jailterms for calling President Johnson a ``murderer.'' Insulting thehead of a friendly state was a criminal offense in the Netherlandsat the time.   Later in the 1970s, critics of the United States backed theinfluential peace movement here, which spearheaded eight tumultuousyears of opposition to deployment of U.S.-built, medium-rangenuclear missiles.   Now the peace movement has all but withered away because of the1987 superpower pact banning all medium-range missiles from Europe.   The latest outbreak of anti-American sentiment has focused on thewidely held perception among the Dutch intelligentsia that the U.S.government is meddling in Central American affairs, especially theReagan administration's attempts to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinistagovernment.   But Lammers noted that ``the Dutch government has not at any timebeen anti-American; on the contrary, the Netherlands has always beenone of the United States' most faithful allies.''   ``The relations with the United States are the at the root of oursecurity policy, and those ties will not be severed,'' said Reluster Beek, a prominent parliamentarian for the Labor Party, which isprimed for power after more than 10 years in opposition.   Premier Ruud Lubbers' center-right government resigned in Maybecause of internal differences over how to finance an environmentalclean-up, and a center-left coalition of Lubbers' ChristianDemocrats and Labor is widely expected after elections scheduled forSept. 6.   In the dispute over whether to deploy NATO's medium-range cruisemissiles on Dutch soil, Labor led the parliamentary battle againstdeployment.   But ter Beek said ``the cruise missile episode was a mere ripple.In a good friendship, such things hardly matter.''   The U.S.-Dutch friendship dates back more than two centuries,when the Dutch were among the first to establish diplomatic tieswith the fledgling American republic and loaned money to it to fightthe British.   The financial links are still strong, with the Netherlands thesecond-largest investor in the United States.   And the cultural ties are described by historian Lammers as ``theAmericanization of daily life'' here. The public is bombarded withAmerican movies, television soap operas and fashions, whiletelevision and radio commercials increasingly use heavily accentedAmerican English to get their messages across.   ``We've always reproached the Americans for their superficiality,their vulgarity, the McDonald's culture,'' Lammers said.   ``But it has been enthusiastically embraced by the youngergeneration, which likes the jeans, the chewing gum, the relaxed lifestyle as opposed to the rigidity of the old Dutch class system,'' hesaid.   But the love-hate attitude of the Dutch intelligentsia is mostacute in the field of U.S. foreign policy.   ``I'm seething when American soldiers are flown to Panama if thatcountry's leaders aren't sufficiently servile, and I think theU.S.A. should be thrown out of NATO,'' Dutch columnist Maaike Helderrecently wrote in the left-leaning Amsterdam newspaper De Volkskrant.   ``But no. What would I be without the books of Faulkner, Twain,Roth, Salinger, Bellow? Where would I be without Billie Holiday,Louis Armstrong, and Prince?'' he added.   ``American culture is more important to me than Dutch culture.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday July 16</NOTE></DOC>
