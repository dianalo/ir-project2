Action on Cambodia</HEAD><BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cambodian resistance leader Son Sann urgedthe General Assembly on Wednesday to keep up pressure on Vietnam andfor the 10th consecutive year to vote for a Vietnamese troopwithdrawal from Cambodia.   ``We are more than ever close to a settlement,'' Son Sann said.``We need your support more than ever ... to maintain the necessarypressure to obtain the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cambodia.''   He asked for a fixed timetable for withdrawal.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978. Every year since then,the 159-nation General Assembly has overwhelmingly condemned theoccupation and called for Hanoi to withdraw its troops, nowestimated at 130,000.   Among signs of movement in resolving the Cambodian conflict is adialogue now under way among Cambodian factions and between Chinaand the Soviet Union.   Son Sann is prime minister of the three-party coalitiongovernment-in-exile of Democratic Kampuchea, or Cambodia, which isrecognized by the United Nations.   The resistance coalition's forces fighting the Vietnamese includeSon Sann's faction; the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk; and thecommunist Khmer Rouge, the largest and strongest force, armed byChina.   Communist Vietnam ousted the Khmer Rouge regime and replaced itwith a pro-Hanoi government, which the U.N. refuses to accept.   One complaint expressed by Vietnam's ambassador to the U.N.,Trinh Xuan Lang, in rejecting this year's resolution on troopwithdrawal was that it does not emphasize the importance ofexcluding Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and his associates from anyfuture government in Cambodia.   About 1 million Cambodians were killed by executions, famine andcivil unrest under the Khmer Rouge from 1975-78 until the Vietnameseinvaders routed the Pol Pot regime.   The vote last year was 117 to 21. The resolution was expected togain at least one vote this year, despite Soviet and Vietnameselobbying in favor of a milder draft resolution which would not callfor withdrawal.   Son Sann appealed to Moscow Wednesday, saying: ``The cessation ofSoviet aid to Vietnam would contribute greatly to withdrawal ofoccupying forces from Cambodia.''   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov struck a conciliatorynote in his address, emphasizing the importance of ongoing dialogueamong Cambodian factions and countries in Southeast Asia.   He said, however, that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops mustbe linked to excluding Pol Pot and his associates, a sentiment thathas been echoed by several nations.   But Chinese Ambassador Li Luye, whose government is the mainbacker and arms supplier of the Khmer Rouge, maintained a hard line,insisting on the total and unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamesetroops as the first step in a comprehensive political settlement.   Li signaled, however, that China tempers its political support ofthe Khmer Rouge with realism by emphasizing that no single factionshould dominate in a provisional government and no faction should beexcluded.   Son Sann said that after Vietnamese troop withdrawal, a new,provisional government must be formed in Phnom Penh from the threerebel factions and Cambodians in the Vietnamese-backed governmentthat would be dissolved. No faction would dominate and no one wouldbe eliminated, he said.   An international commission would oversee that phase as well asholding free and fair elections to choose a new government of aneutral and non-aligned Cambodia.   Asked about his uneasy alliance with the Khmer Rouge, Son Sanntold reporters: ``We are in a coalition with a precise goal, to freeour country from the Vietnamese occupation.''   The Cambodia resolution this year calls for the ``non-return ofthe universally condemned policies and practices of the recentpast.''   Son Sann said that phrase refers to the Vietnamese, although itis widely taken to refer as well to the Khmer Rouge.</TEXT></DOC>
