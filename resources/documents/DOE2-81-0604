The lungs of these animals were examined histologically and thearea of parenchymal tissue involved in focal lesions typical of ozone-induceddamage was measured. Exposures were conducted using a specially designed,nose-only system that effectively eliminated the neutralization of acidsby ammonia generated from animal excreta. The atmosphere generation systempermitted, not only the introduction of acids, per se, but the de novoformation of acid compounds such as nitric and sulfuric acids from precursorgas phase compounds (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide). Thus,these experiments were carried out in a manner which closely simulatedprocesses known to occur in ambient atmospheres. Parenchymal damage wasenhanced when exposure atmospheres contained both ozone and acidic aerosols.</TEXT></DOC>
