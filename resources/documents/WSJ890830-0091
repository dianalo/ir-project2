Echoes of the voices of Huck Finn and Holden Caulfield seem virtually inescapable in such books, but this doesn't prevent them from being interesting in their own right.    David Lipsky's &quot;Three Thousand Dollars&quot; (Summit, 203 pages, $18.95) is a collection of stories that hangs together like fragments of a novel, with the same or similar characters reappearing throughout. Some of the best stories are seen through the eyes of a young man who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with his divorced mother, an unsuccessful artist who is struggling to make economic and psychological ends meet. In the title story, Richard has misspent his $3,000 college tuition money on &quot;books and things, movies,&quot; and is called to account by his father in California and his mother at home, each in their tellingly different way. In &quot;Shh,&quot; the teen-aged Richard helps navigate his mother through the treacherous waters of yet another opening at her former gallery. This touching story includes a sly and amusing take on the New York art scene, as well as a moving portrait of Richard's plucky but increasingly desperate mother.    Mr. Lipsky's first book is a promising debut. Although he is not much of a prose stylist, and not much actually happens in most of the stories, he has a nice straightforward way of dealing with people and events and is a keen and sympathetic observer. Best of all, this book radiates a warm humanity and is full of believable, interesting characters. You find yourself turning the pages with pleasure to find out what is going to happen to them.    Holly Uyemoto, on the other hand, has a fine musical ear and a very distinctive authorial voice. This 19-year-old author's first novel, &quot;Rebel Without a Clue&quot; (Crown, 192 pages, $17.95), boasts a surprising technical finish for someone so young. Her narrator, Christian Delon, is whiling away the summer between high school and college in Marin County with his best friend, the celebrated Thomas Bainbridge, who is touted as the highest-paid male model in the world. A good deal of energy is spent partying and trying to be cool, but eventually Christian is struck dumb by Thomas's revelation that he has contracted AIDS, and by Thomas's irresponsible behavior in the wake of this discovery.    Although Ms. Uyemoto obviously has a good deal of raw talent, most readers might want to wait to sample it until after she has had a chance to let it simmer a bit more. Though she writes with energy, her self-conscious, slang-filled narrative is peppered with rather too many sophomoric banalities. Example:    &quot;'Cool it, honeybunch,' Flo the hairdresser snapped between chomps on the enormous wad of gum that had probably been surgically implanted in her mouth at birth.&quot;    Paul Watkins also has a fine ear, and his second novel, &quot;Calm at Sunset, Calm at Dawn&quot; (Houghton Mifflin, 280 pages, $17.95), is written with a sure, firm command of language. In it, 19-year-old James Pfeiffer, who comes from a seafaring Rhode Island family, has been kicked out of college for punching a classmate who stole his camera. Against his family's wishes -- his father wants his sons to find &quot;a way out of fishing&quot; -- James decides to prove himself by going to sea.    The scenes of shipboard life and the hardships suffered there are especially vivid, and the writing is lyrical without being strained. Mr. Watkins, however, is better at describing places and things than at evoking people, and the book suffers from a lack of narrative tension. Despite the strength of the writing, one eventually gets impatient with the way the story, like the sea, seems to go on and on.    Margaret Diehl's &quot;Men&quot; (Washington Square Press, 282 pages, $7.95), published in hardcover last year and now out in a quality paperback format, is a most clever combination of a coming-of-age novel with a picaresque recounting of one man's sexual adventures. Except in this case, it is one woman's sexual adventures.    At the beginning of the book, Stella Smith and her lazy, rich, alcoholic boyfriend, Teo, drop out of college and go to live together in his family's empty Park Avenue apartment. As Teo's drinking becomes all-consuming, he loses interest in everything else, especially sex. &quot;It's so repetitive,&quot; he tells Stella. And when she answers that so is getting drunk, he counters: &quot;But I don't remember it. So it's not really repetition. It's more like -- the Eternal Now.&quot;    Out of boredom, and driven by an impulse that she doesn't quite understand, Stella begins to pick up strangers for one-night stands. Most of these encounters are not very interesting, either from a human or purely prurient perspective. To make matters worse, when Stella leaves for California at around page 50, she leaves behind Teo, who turns out to be the most interesting character in the book.    The rest of the story continues Stella's sexual adventures, and relates her attempts to come to grips with having been abandoned by her parents as a child and to find true love. Toward the end, as Stella strains toward happiness, the plot takes so many unlikely twists and turns that it becomes even more unbelievable than the two-dimensional characters that fill the book. Which is too bad, since at her best Ms. Diehl writes with verve and intelligence. </TEXT></DOC>
