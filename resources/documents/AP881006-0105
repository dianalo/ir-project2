President Chadli Bendjedid said all civil administrative andsecurity services were placed under military command, but themeasures did not bring an immediate halt to the rioting. Arsonistsset fire to several government buildings.   The decision was required by ``grave developments in thesituation in Algiers,'' Bendjedid said in a statement. He said thestate of emergency was invoked under the constitution.   On Wednesday evening, fire destroyed the Ministry of Youth andSports, the government-sponsored soccer betting agency, the townhall and numerous shops.   Protesters set several more fires today, including one at aMinistry of Education building. Looters were seen leaving thebuilding, and official files were blowing around in the windoutside.   Police anti-riot squads used force against groups of youths thatrioted in the streets of the capital this morning to protest the 15percent annual inflation rate.   One police unit armed with shields and riot sticks launched teargas grenades at a group of youngsters gathered near AlgiersUniversity. Previously, the anti-riot squads remained in thebackground during two days of unprecedented rioting in the city.   It was not known today whether anyone was hurt during therioting. An unknown number of youths were arrested on charges oflooting. First estimates of the damage to the city exceeded $100million.   Under the government's econcomic reform program, prices forbasic food staples have risen dramatically. A pound of beef sellsfor about $11.40 or more, and in some places drinking water is soldfor about $4 a gallon.   Proclamation of the state of emergency came after Bendjedid andthe top members of his government met Wednesday night with theNational Liberation Front, the only political party; and theleaders of the state-sponsored labor union.   Rifle-toting soldiers in riot gear and steel helmets weredeployed today at the harbor, the bus station, the seafrontNational Assembly building, the headquarters of the ruling party,and the courtyard of the national radio and television service.   The streets were almost deserted with the exception of a fewcars and buses that made their way between vehicles wrecked inWednesday's rioting. Firemen worked throughout the night toextinguish fires left by the rioters.   At Bab-El-Oued, where the riots began Tuesday night, and at ElBiar, police squads equipped with water cannon, armored cars andpolice dogs stood ready, particularly near the big public schools.   Witnesses said different groups of rioters seemed to aim atdifferent targets. Groups of youngsters began the rioting withcalls against the high cost of living. They were followed by olderrioters who chanted Islamic slogans and seemed to aim at foreignand private businesses.   Both groups were swept away by vandals dissembling and burningfurniture, equipment, computers and files, and looting shops.   Bendjedid, facing the most serious challenge since he came topower 10 years ago, warned Wednesday that he would ``intervene withall vigor'' against any further rioting.</TEXT></DOC>
