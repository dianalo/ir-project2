The Bahamian government has joined the United States in combineddrug raids and allowed a U.S. Customs base on Gun Cay south ofBimini, The Miami Herald reported Monday.   ``We're at a very high level of cooperation at this point,''said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan in Miami.   Sheehan's statement was echoed by Jack Hook, spokesman for theDrug Enforcement Administration.   But chances that the prime minster, Sir Lynden O. Pindling,could be prosecuted on drug-related charges appear remote becauseof obstacles in an ongoing probe of an overseas drug-smugglingnetwork.   First, the shaky status of federal drug indictments in Miami andTampa against Panama Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has raised doubtsabout whether the United States would want to indict a foreign headof state. The Reagan administration reportedly has offered to dropthe indictments in a deal in which Noriega would step down frompower.   ``I find very little incentive indicting foreign potentates ifthe State Department can negotiate them right out from under myfeet,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who has indicated he'llquit if the indictment against Noriega is dropped.   Merkle, of Tampa, has refused to comment on the reported probeof Pindling.   The Herald said a grand jury in Orlando is hearing testimonyagainst Pindling, the Bahamian leader since 1967 who was re-electedlast year after his government was rocked by a drug-corruptionscandal.   The Herald, citing a ``well-placed source,'' said a July 4deadline has been set for an indictment of Pindling.   Another major obstacle, The Herald said, is the statute oflimitations. Pindling's probe stemmed from testimony given byprosecution witnesses in the Jacksonville federal trial ofconvicted Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas.   Most of the allegations raised against Pindling in the Lehdertrial involved incidents in the late 1970s and 1980, which wouldput them past the five-year statute of limitations.   Merkle prosecuted Lehder, who was accused of using the privateBahamian island of Norman's Cay as a cocaine trans-shipment pointand was convicted on all drug counts he faced.   During Lehder's trial, Merkle called Pindling ``aco-conspirator.'' Prosecution witness George Baron said Bahamianpolice were guarding the prime minister when he delivered asuitcase with $400,000 to Pindling in 1980 for alleged protectionof Baron's marijuana-smuggling through the Bahamas.   Pindling, in a May 4 statement, denied Baron's story and chargesof corruption and bribe-taking. The Bahamian government ranfull-page ads May 10 in U.S. newspapers stressing its commitment tofighting drugs and protesting what they called old allegations.   A 1984 Royal Commission of Inquiry detailed corruption in lowerlevels of the Bahamian government and law enforcement, but stoppedshort of linking Pindling to the drug corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
