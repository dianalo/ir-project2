Gallagher andamp; Co. said the board adopted an anti-takeover measure that involves the distribution of common stock purchase rights to shareholders.    Under certain circumstances, the rights, which are subject to shareholder approval at the annual meeting May 12, entitle the holder to buy the stock of an acquiring company at half price.
