It's also a scene that hasn't been seen with as much regularity asthe A's would like in 1991.;    Batting-wise, the A's stranded 12 runners.;   &quot;On the competitive end, it's good for the team,&quot; A's Manager Tony La Russasaid. &quot;Normally, tough games keep you on edge and sharp. But we should havewon by more. Welch was outstanding.&quot;;    It was Welch's first victory in 20days. The 1990 Cy Young Award winner, who produced a team-record 27 victorieslast season, allowed four hits and three walks -- all proving costly as thethree ended up scoring.;    &quot;You try and get a little too perfect sometimes,&quot;said Welch, who improved his record to 5-3. &quot;And it can cost you.&quot;;    In theeighth inning, with the A's holding on to the 4-3 lead, Welch faced Milwaukeethird baseman Gary Sheffield, who has fared well against Welch in his career.;   Paul Molitor was on third base with one out when Sheffield came to bat.Welch came through with a strikeout, his third of the game.;    &quot;It was asituation where you don't have too much room for error,&quot; said Welch, who threw104 pitches. &quot;It's a situation where you absolutely need a strikeout and yougo for it and fortunately you get it. He hits me well. Period.&quot;;    Welch thengot Robin Yount to ground out to end the threat. Eckersley, who earned hisleague-leading 16th save, got into some trouble before finishing the game withtwo strikeouts.;    Greg Vaughn reached second base to lead off the ninth whenRickey Henderson lost Vaughn's fly in the lights.;    Eckersley then gotFranklin Stubbs to fly out before walking pinch hitter Greg Brock. It wasEckersley's first walk in 123 batters this season. The bullpen ace then struckout Jim Gantner and Dale Sveum to end the game.;    &quot;I started thinking aboutBobby (Welch),&quot; Eckersley said. &quot;I thought, 'Oh no, Bobby's going to kill me.Those are really the thoughts I think out there.&quot;;    &quot;When the leadoff(error) in the ninth doesn't score,&quot; La Russa said, &quot;That's special. Pitchingdeserves a special patch for this one.&quot;;    After Milwaukee tied the game at2-2 in the fifth, the A's took the lead for good in the fifth when Bainesdelivered a sacrifice fly to center field that scored Ernest Riles, who hadwalked to lead off the inning and went to third when Dave Henderson's grounderto second base went between Gantner's legs.;    Following a Mark McGwirestrikeout and a single by Willie Wilson, which put runners at first and third,Jamie Quirk delivered his third single of the game to score Dave Hendersonfrom third.;    Both runs were unearned because of Gantner's error.;  HOW THEYSCORED;    A's 3rd: Blankenship singled. R.Henderson walked, movingBlankenship to second. Riles sacrificed, moving Blankenship to third andR.Henderson to second. D.Henderson grounded out, scoring Blankenship andmoving R.Henderson to third.
