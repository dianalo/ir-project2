SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM F LABORAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DEARBORN, Mich  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ford Motor Co. made a general proposal to the United Auto Workers union that the company said &quot;provides for continuing quality improvement, personal economic growth and greater job security.&quot;    The auto maker, as expected, offered lump-sum payments instead of base wage raises in the first year of the contract, according to officials who attended the hour-long session. But the company didn't specify the suggested size of the payments and gave no indication about what it was offering in the following two years of the pact, the officials added.    Ford negotiators also stressed that they felt their profit-sharing formula had done much to help workers, implying that profit-sharing should play a major role in any new compensation agreement. In addition, the company offered a slight increase in pension payments.    The UAW has said repeatedly that job security is its top issue in these talks. Stanley J. Surma, Ford's top negotiator, acknowledged in a news conference after the meeting that &quot;job security is the key to a successful settlement&quot; and said that the company was willing &quot;to negotiate meaningful job security for UAW-represented employees.&quot;    But he added that &quot;any job security program must be linked inseparably to (Ford's) ability to achieve quality leadership in the industry, and to enhance competitiveness and to improve critical operating flexibility.&quot;    He said the company didn't offer any specific job-security proposals at the session.    &quot;It's the type of proposal that you would think most companies would put across the table as their first proposal,&quot; said Stephen P. Yokich, the UAW's main negotiator at Ford. &quot;We are concerned about the job security portion of it,&quot; he added. &quot;Quite frankly they're still talking in concepts. I hope very soon they tell us what the concept is rather than keep telling us that there is a concept.&quot;    General Motors Corp., which also is negotiating with the UAW will make a proposal to the union today. On Monday, the union is expected to pick one of the companies as its strike target. It then will focus its attention at that auto maker for a settlement by the Sept. 14 deadline, and a possible strike if it can't get a contract by then. Chrysler Corp.'s U.S. contract doesn't expire until next year. </TEXT></DOC>
