Police said 16 women were detained, most of them Palestinians.Police sprayed the area with tear gas, and reporters saw womenkicked, struck with nightsticks and dragged to police wagons.   One women shouted ``Peace! Peace! Peace!'' as police dragged herby her hair.   Among those detained was Dacia Valent, an Italian citizen who isa member of the European Parliament. She was taken into custodyafter protesting the arrests to police.   The women's peace march, which wound through city streets fromJewish west Jerusalem to Arab east Jerusalem, was one of severalmajor events planned to precede Saturday's ``human chain'' aroundthe old, walled city.   Police moved in to disperse the demonstrators after aPalestinian flag was raised in the courtyard of a theater in eastJerusalem.   It was unclear who raised the flag, but Palestinian women in thecourtyard immediately took up chanting ``Israel No, PLO!'' andother anti-Israeli slogans.   This morning, soldiers set up checkpoints on roads from the WestBank, increasing rally organizers' fears that the army intended toblock Palestinians from joining with Israelis and the 1,200Europeans in Saturday's ``human chain.''   Authorities have denied visas, barred visits to Palestinianrefugee camps and blocked tour buses from traveling to West Bankcities.   Army spokesmen said the checkpoints were not intended to closeoff the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, they have refusedcomment on Israeli news reports they will do so Saturday.   Organizers of the ``1990 _ Time for Peace'' rally say their goalis to foster dialogue between Arabs and Jews.   ``We have emphasized that we are here to support the peacevoices on both sides,'' said Chiara Ingrao, an organizer from theItalian Peace Association.   Israeli officials said, however, that they fear the activists'visit could spark more violence in the 2-year-old Palestinianuprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and GazaStrip.   ``The army frowns on people trying to make political statements,especially those who are not citizens of the country, in theterritories,'' said one army official, who insisted on anonymity.   The activists' vision of peace is at odds with the Israeligovernment's view on three points; the activists call fornegotiations with the PLO, an international Middle East peaceconference and establishment of a Palestinian state alongsideIsrael.   Janet Aviad, a spokeswoman for the Israeli group Peace Now, asponsor of the rally, said the government is ``afraid of Europeanpressure and American pressure, and this event covered by the presshas potential for international pressure.''   The Europeans include about 900 from Italy and smallerdelegations from Great Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands andSwitzerland, as well as some Palestinian-Americans. Other sponsorsinclude groups from Italy, Holland and Britain, and localPalestinian activists.   Late Wednesday night, police searched the corridors of theEuropeans' headquarters hotel. Police spokesman Avi Zelba said thesearches ``in principle were not related to their visit'' but wereaimed at apprehending a wanted Palestinian.   Israel radio reported Thursday that Moslem fundamentalists fromthe Islamic Jihad group issued threats in Sweden and Italy forpeople not to participate in a rally that encouraged Jewish-Arabcooperation.   However, rally organizers issued a statement saying theyconsider the threats ``untrustworthy and unfounded.''</TEXT></DOC>
