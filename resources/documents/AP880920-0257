Speaking at a press conference at the Asia-Pacific PetroleumConference here, Rilwanu Lukman also said OPEC's production may behigher than recent estimates.   Lukman said the five-member committee scheduled to meet Sept. 25and 26 at an as yet undisclosed location, has a number of items onits agenda besides the current oversupply of oil that has depressedworld prices.   ``Present (oil market) conditions are serious, but whether theywarrent an emergency meeting is for the committee to decide,''Lukman said. ``...It's by no means the only problem we have onhand.''   While the price committee cannot determine policy or setproduction limits, it has the authority to call a meeting of thefull cartel, which can.   World oil prices have declined in recent weeks on fears thatseveral OPEC countries were continuing to overproduce, adding tothe already excessive supply of oil. Last week, U.S. crude oilprices dipped to near a two-year low then rebounded slightly onreports that OPEC was reducing its output.   However, Lukman estimated OPEC production is between 19 millionand 19.5 million barrels a day, higher than recent estimates ofbetween 18.5 million and 19 million barrels.   The OPEC president cautioned it was difficult to assess currentcartel output.   ``I think some people are very brave or very smart to make anestimate,'' he said.   On Monday, an industry newsletter said that Saudi Arabia, OPEC'slargest producer, was intentionally exceeding it production quotato challenge other members to reduce their output.   Lukman said OPEC cooperation with non-OPEC oil producers wouldbe another topic for discussion at next week's meeting, along withthe Iran-Iraq cease- fire. He said collaboration with non-OPECproducers is ``perhaps the only way we can get better (crude oil)prices.''   ``The fact of the matter is there's some form of overproduction,and it's not just OPEC alone,'' Lukman said.   Lukman said OPEC is looking for specific cuts in non-OPECproduction ``as a guide to what (OPEC) will be able to do ourselvesto help in pushing prices up.''   The cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq would helpOPEC planning, he said, but added that he doesn't expect Iraq toreturn to its OPEC-assigned quota of 1.5 million barrels a day.   Iraq is said to be producing approximately 2.7 million barrelsof oil a day and the country's oil minister said recently that itmay have to increase its output to gain the necessary revenue torebuild its war-torn economy.   ``If they want to do 2.7 million, suppose Saudi Arabia says theywon't go below 10 million (barrels per day) as a counter to whatIraq said?'' Lukman asked, quickly stressing his example washypothetical. Earlier, he denied he had information that SaudiArabia was overproducing.</TEXT></DOC>
