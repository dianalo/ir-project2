Conservatives realize the impending nomination of Vice President George Bush means they have suffered a setback, but now they are engaged in a bitter dispute over whether their movement would suffer more if Mr. Bush wins in November or if he loses.    These angry rumblings on the right conceivably could jeopardize the Republicans' prospects in the fall campaign against Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. But even the conservatives most eager to unify behind Mr. Bush acknowledge that his operatives have tended to take them for granted, bragging over his success in the primaries rather than reaching out to broaden the vice president's support. The conservatives have won few concessions and have received few assurances that their voices will be heeded.    &quot;He doesn't like us,&quot; says Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, a leading voice among young House conservatives, &quot;and his people don't like us.&quot;    Conservatives want Mr. Bush to pledge to name a conservative to the Supreme Court. They are asking him to indicate that he will appoint conservatives to top White House and Cabinet positions. They want a commitment to the notion that the U.S. should set out to &quot;defeat communism.&quot; They are calling for a renewed effort against abortion. They want Mr. Bush to vow to cut spending and to keep to his pledge not to raise taxes. But most of all, they are pressing Mr. Bush to name a conservative running mate such as Rep. Jack Kemp of New York or Sen. William Armstrong of Colorado.    &quot;The signal you send to the conservatives comes with the vice president,&quot; says Lance Tarrance, a GOP pollster. &quot;It's Bush's way of saying how he's going to invest in the future.&quot;    Conservatives on both sides of the debate over whether to assist Mr. Bush contend that the vice president hasn't taken a strong enough position within the administration on the Strategic Defense Initiative, President Reagan's plan for an anti-nuclear shield, or on aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. They worry that in his campaigning he has given few signals about the character of a Bush administration and has made scant gestures in the conservatives' direction.    &quot;Nothing they're doing (in the Bush campaign) suggests they are as concerned about this as they ought to be,&quot; charges Paul Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation, a conservative research group.    Today's primary here in Pennsylvania should push Mr. Bush over the top to clinch the GOP presidential nomination. At this moment of triumph, Bush aides seek to play down the dissension within the Republican ranks, arguing that, as campaign manager Lee Atwater puts it, &quot;George Bush is a conservative.&quot; They add that the campaign has little worry about estranging conservatives because they are not likely to vote for Mr. Dukakis in any case.    &quot;If they believe in the issues we're talking about, and worry about future Supreme Court appointments, there's no way they'll vote for Dukakis,&quot; says Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, who headed the Bush campaign there and will direct the Bush platform effort at the GOP convention. &quot;But we want more than their votes, we want their help.&quot;    Conservatives provide much of the energy and work behind Republican campaigns, and a GOP candidate who doesn't have their enthusiastic support forfeits an important resource. &quot;We may not have anyplace to go,&quot; says Brent Bozell, executive director of the Conservative Victory Committee, &quot;but we might stay home.&quot;    In recent weeks Mr. Bush's top advisers have begun meeting quietly with conservative leaders in an effort to quell the rebellion on the Republican Party's right.    Many of these prominent conservatives seeking a rapprochement with the Bush camp are resigned to the presence in the Bush inner circle of Treasury Secretary James Baker, a pragmatist who was blamed for trying to blunt President Reagan's conservative tendencies. But they take heart from the fact that when Mr. Bush faced defeat in New Hampshire, he called on Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter who is popular among conservatives, for help.    They believe that Mr. Bush may soon make a gesture in the direction of Education Secretary William Bennett, a conservative icon, perhaps by offering him a senior, visible role in the campaign. They note that Mr. Bush has said he has thumbed through &quot;Issues '88,&quot; a three-volume, 238-plank, conservative &quot;platform for America&quot; issued last month by the Heritage Foundation and the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation.    Their greatest hope is that the lack of ideological rigor in the Bush campaign may give them an opportunity to shape policy views.    &quot;We think he's open to our ideas,&quot; says Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation. &quot;I'm not saying that he embraces the ideas and will march with them, but he'll listen.&quot;    Even so, enormous hostility remains toward Mr. Bush.    &quot;I'm not stocking up on razor blades to cut my wrists if Bush loses,&quot; says Richard Viguerie, a Virginia mail-order specialist prominent in conservative causes. Donald Devine, a former adviser to the Robert Dole campaign and the chairman of a group to press Mr. Bush to adopt conservative issues, warns that he detects &quot;a strong feeling that it might not be so bad an idea to lose this election.&quot;    Many of the conservatives reluctant to help Mr. Bush worry that his success would mean the re-emergence in the party of a moderate element with strong ties to Wall Street and the Eastern establishment and suffused with a country-club air. Although TV evangelist Jerry Falwell has long been a Bush supporter, many on the religious right view Mr. Bush with skepticism, if not contempt. Gary Jarmin, a political consultant to Christian Voice, a New Right organization, says that many conservatives &quot;have been fighting the George Bushes all their lives&quot; and aren't moved to assist him now.    &quot;They've done everything they can to rob, cheat and steal power from us -- and now that they've beaten us down they want unity and peace,&quot; says Bryan McCanless, a conservative activist from Mauldin, S.C.    And even conservatives who say they support Mr. Bush have little hope of moving him to the right or of reaching an understanding with his aides. &quot;Leopards don't change their spots in their mid 60s,&quot; says Howard Phillips, who heads the Conservative Caucus. &quot;All these people from Skull and Bones and Milton Academy are all swell fellows, but they don't have the slightest idea what we're talking about.&quot;    Above all, the ascendancy of Mr. Bush stands as a symbol of the failure of the conservative movement to build on the momentum of the Reagan revolution. Says Rep. Weber: &quot;The nomination of George Bush and perhaps his election isn't a disaster -- he's not hopeless -- but we're beginning to recognize that the sort of aggressive conservatism we've been pushing doesn't have any leadership or any visibility anymore.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
