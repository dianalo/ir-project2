Venezuelan oil minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, disclosingthe agreement to reporters at the 13-nation cartel's regularmidyear meeting, said ``we think the market will have a goodperception of what we have done.''   Nevertheless, the agreement confirmed widespread speculationthat the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wouldn'tagree on significant new moves to cut the world supply of oil.Prices are now substantially below OPEC's $18-per-barrel objective.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a sensitive barometer ofprices, the July contract for West Texas Intermediate crude fell 30cents Monday to close at $16.43 a barrel, partly in anticipation ofthe OPEC agreement reached today.   The ministers, who began their conference on Saturday, gatheredto decide whether to change the agreement among 12 of the producersthat limits output to 15.06 million barrels a day.   Delegation sources said the ministers had haggled over whetherto extend the accord by three months or six months. The accord wasto have expired June 30.   High-level sources in several delegations, speaking on conditionof anonymity earlier, said a majority of the OPEC ministers hadfavored the shorter extension. But the minority, favoring thelonger extension, included influential Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggestproducer.   Analysts had said the prospect of yet another extensionhighlighted OPEC's inability to overcome its differences onproduction levels and agree on a common formula to raise prices.   One OPEC faction has wanted to cut production to push prices upto the target level. The Saudi-led minority has wanted to increaseproduction or at least maintain it at current levels to takeadvantage of an increase in demand expected in the second half ofthe year and to maintain OPEC's market share.   Iraq refused to sign the current accord because it wants a quotaequal to that of Iran, with which it has been at war since 1980.OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said it wasunlikely Iraq would participate in the latest agreement.   Lukman said Monday that the ministers were working hard on acompromise to bring Iraq back into the fold.   Iran has a daily production quota of 2.369 million barrels.Iraq, which previously had a quota of 1.54 million barrels a day,is producing 2.6 million barrels daily.   Success on that front would lower Iraq's production, which couldhelp boost oil prices.   The United Arab Emirates' oil minister, Mana Saeed Oteiba, leftthe talks on Sunday. He said he needed to consult with hisgovernment and might or might not return, although he left the restof the UAE delegation behind.   Hernandez, however, said it was likely Otgiba would return todayto sign the rollover agreement.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
