The weekend meeting also broke up without a compromise on whatcurrency will be used for the European Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment, where it will be located or how shareholdings will bebalanced against voting rights.   ``The most difficult question is the eligibility of one countryin particular,'' said Jacques Attali, an aide to French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand, who proposed the bank in October.   It was a reference to the Soviet Union, whose full participationin the bank has been opposed by the United States.   Attali, who presided over the talks, affirmed that the SovietUnion's presence at the discussions meant it would have some futurerole. He said the application of any country wishing to join wouldbe considered.   Israel, Egypt, Morocco, South Korea and Lichtenstein took partin the talks for the first time, adding to the original 34 Westernand Eastern European countries and the United States and Japan.   ``We have opened up the teller's window,'' Attali said. ``Themore countries that wish to support the revolutions in central andEastern Europe, the better.''   At the first session in January, held to set terms for the bank,the United States ruled out Soviet participation unless Moscow madethe ruble a convertible currency and began other market reforms.   The United States also says the Soviet Union hasn't gone as fartoward democracy as other East European countries, notably Poland,Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The bank would also benefit Yugoslavia,East Germany, Romania and Bulgaria.   ``The U.S. is not isolated by any means at all,'' Attali said,indicating other nations also object to full Soviet participation.   Attali refused to comment directly on a compromise offered byFrance. It would allow the Soviets to join the bank as a 6 percentshareholder and limit them to 6 percent of total lending.   The issued could be resolved before the next meeting, which isset for April 9. Attali said negotiators were ``at the point ofconsensus'' and believed the last obstacles would soon be overcome.   The participants did agree that the 12-nation European Communitywould provide 51 percent of the bank capital of about $12 billion,Attali said.   Negotiators have also found common ground on how loans will bedistributed between the private and public sectors, Attali said.But he refused to reveal the formula.   Japan, Britain and the United States had insisted loans berestricted to private sector investment. Some other countriesproposed allowing 40 percent be made available for public projectslike roads and telephone networks.   Attali predicted final terms could be set in April or May, withthe bank making loans by the end of the year or in early 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
