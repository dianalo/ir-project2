(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge Wednesday sentencedconvicted Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas to amaximum life sentence without parole plus 135 years as a sign ofsociety's determination to expunge ``this cancer.''   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton brushed aside Lehder'scontention that he was a political prisoner.   Lehder, who prosecutors called a key figure in the MedellinCartel drug ring said to be responsible for 80 percent of theColombian cocaine coming into the United States, was convicted inMay of importing 3.3 tons of cocaine into the country from hisisland smuggling headquarters in the Bahamas.   Melton imposed the harshest penalty possible under federal lawover defense objections that it exceeded the maximum allowableunder the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty.   The sentence is ``a message .. a signal to our society that itwill do everything it can to rid itself of this cancer,'' Meltonsaid.   During a 25-minute speech to the court prior to the sentencing,Lehder portrayed himself as a victim of the political ambitions ofU.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, now a candidate for the Republicannomination for Florida's U.S. Senate seat.   ``I have been Mr. Merkle's hostage,'' said Lehder. ``I'm apolitical prisoner. My arrest is illegal.''   He said he had been ``kidnapped'' and illegally brought to thiscountry because he had been a political leader in Colombia, workingto overthrow the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty.   He was a victim of ``mistreatment and harassment ... andpsychological torture ordered by Mr. Merkle,'' Lehder said inslightly accented English.   But Melton, who earlier Wednesday sentenced Lehder'sco-defendant Jack Carlton Reed to 15 years in prison, said politicswas not at the root of the case.   ``You were not convicted because of your political beliefs,because you are a Colombian,'' the judge said. ``The truth of thematter is (the smuggling) was done for money ... greed.''   Prosecutors had asked for life without parole on the charge ofrunning a continuing criminal enterprise, plus 15 years each of 10drug-smuggling charges. But under the law one drug-smuggling chargehad to be concurrent with the life sentence, leading to the135-year total.   Lehder will also have to pay $350,000 in fines. Reed was fined$25,000 for his conviction on a single count of conspiracy toimport cocaine.   Merkle's replacement, U.S. Attorney Joe Magri, who attended thesentencing as a spectator, called Lehder ``a cocainenarco-terrorist'' and applauded the sentence.   ``The judge fairly, justly and appropriately socked it to ahoodlum,'' said Magri. The sentence ``sends a clear message thatwe're serious about stopping narcotics traffic.''   Lehder, 38, one of the leaders of the violent Medellin Cartelwas convicted May 19 of smuggling Colombian cocaine into the UnitedStates through the Bahamas.   Defense attorneys Edward Shohat and Jose Quinon had asked thejudge to impose a 20-year sentence at most, which they said wouldbe four times longer than the terms being served by the formersmugglers who turned against Lehder and testified for thegovernment.   After listening to almost four hours of arguments and objectionsfrom Lehder's attorneys to pre-sentence reports, Melton told thedefendant that the government had presented ``monumental amounts ofincriminating evidence against you.''   Reciting the lengthy list of convictions, the judge said theydid not adequately portray ``the evidence of your crimes.''   Testimony in the seven-month trial included allegations thatBahamian officials, including Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling,helped Lehder and his smuggling organization run more than 20 tonsof cocaine from Colombia through Norman's Cay into desertedairstrips in Florida and Georgia.   Pindling and his aides have repeatedly denied the allegations.   Lehder was extradited to the United States last year following agun battle and his arrest by the Colombian army at a plush mansionin Medellin.   He also is under indictment in Miami for his role in the cartel,and there is a sealed indictment against him in Los Angeles. Butofficials have said it is highly unlikely that he will be tried onthose charges.   Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., a pilot in the drug-smugglingring, stood silently as he was sentenced. Government witnesses hadtestified that he had made at least seven flights from the Bahamasto ferry 2,500 pounds of cocaine into airports in Florida andGeorgia.</TEXT></DOC>
