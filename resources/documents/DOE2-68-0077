The development and implementationof a new approach -- a dynamic rule-based (RB) dispatch algorithm ispresented, which takes into account the problems faced by the dispatchoperator during a dispatch interval and channels those into a rule base.The new dynamic dispatch requires forecasts of photovoltaic generationsat the beginning of each dispatch interval. A Box-Jenkins time-seriesmethod is used to model the sub-hourly solar irradiance. This model isextended to yield forecast parameters which are then used to predictthe photovoltaic output expected to occur at certain lead times coincidingwith the economic dispatch intervals. The RB is introduced to operateeither as a substitute for, or an aide to the dispatch operator. TheRB gives one of 16 possible solutions as and when required. These solutionsare written as rules which manipulate the non-committable generationto achieve an optimal solution. It is concluded that results depend onthe time of the year and the specific utility. Also, the utility generatingcapacity mix significantly influences the results.</TEXT></DOC>
