Each chamber rejected several attempts to overhaul theirblueprints for tax and spending policy in fiscal 1990 and thenratified the packages strongly in their final votes.   The House approved its plan 263-157, after budget committeechairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., called it ``the only choice for usto fulfill our budget responsibilities and avoid crisis.''   The Senate then passed its version, 68-31, after some minortinkering and much grumbling that the deficit reduction in it wasinadequate.   ``It's clearly an attempt for this administration to be able tomuddle its way through its first year,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,D-Texas, who was the Democrats' vice presidential candidate lastyear.   Both chambers on Thursday overwhelmingly rejected more ambitiousproposals to ``freeze'' government spending and cut further intothe deficit. The House also soundly defeated a proposal to cut redink by taxing imported oil, a day after the Senate went on recordagainst a gasoline tax boost.   As laid out by the White House agreement, the budgets claim toshrink the federal deficit to just below $100 billion, as requiredby the Gramm-Rudman law. They would allow federal programs to growbut, especially at the Pentagon, at less than the rate of inflation.   More than half of the nearly $28 billion in claimed ``savings''would be from higher revenues _ sales of government assets, higherfees for government services, and $5.3 billion in unspecified taxincreases.   Critics said too much of the deficit reduction would be achievedthrough false accounting and gimmicks which do nothing to addressthe government's long-term fiscal imbalance.   Defenders of the plan said more could be done later. Theydescribed the budget as the first step in a continuingdeficit-reduction effort with the White House _ a cooperationmarking a sharp change from the years of budget warfare during theReagan administration.   ``It's minimal, manageable, done collaboratively,'' said Sen.Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., senior Republican on the Senate BudgetCommittee, who argued that the long-term fruits of the new spiritof bipartisan cooperation were ``immeasurable.''   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said the rosy economic assumptionsused to calculate the lower deficit figures were ``somewherebetween unlikely and preposterous.''   ``This budget can, at the most charitable, be characterized as aslide-by budget,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who said manylawmakers were frustrated by the constraints of the White Houseagreement.   While some may have been frustrated, it appeared most werewilling to go along in putting off any more ambitiousdeficit-reduction efforts until later.   House Democratic and Republican leaders cooperated to assurepassage Thursday of their chamber's version of the budget, rulingout in advance any amendments which threatened to upset thedelicate pact worked out in weeks of talks with the White House.   Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the new No. 2 Republican in the House,urged ``everyone on our side to vote for the bipartisan package.''In past years, Gingrich and other House GOP members rarelysupported a budget in significant numbers.   The Senate, meantime, appeared resignd to its own version of theplan.   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, noted that the Senatewas accomplishing in two days what often has taken two weeks ormore. The Senate even took time off from its budget debate Thursdayto consider a resolution on the elections in Panama.   The House and Senate must reconcile their competing versions ofthe budget before it becomes final. That should be an easier taskthan usual this year, because the broad outlines for federalspending were set in the bipartisan agreement.   Military spending was set at $299.2 billion, about the same asthis year, and $4.2 billion less than needed to keep pace withinflation. Total Pentagon obligations, including those which spreadpast the end of fiscal 1990, were capped at $305.5 billion.   About $17 billion would be set aside for foreign aid.   The House and Senate versions both, under the agreement, callfor cost-cutting in entitlement programs, including Medicarepayments to doctors and hospitals and farm subsidies.   The agreement set an overall cap for domestic spending and thetwo chambers took somewhat different approaches. The Houseallocated slightly more for education and health while the Senatefavored agriculture, energy and law enforcement.   Both chambers voted during their debates to increase spendingfor veterans health care well above the president's request, toaddress problems in that system.   The House plan contains more specifics, but both envision $2.7billion in new fees for government services. Targets for the newfees include boat owners, the nuclear power industry andbroadcasters. A current fee for veterans home loans, due to expire,would be extended.   The $5.7 billion in assets sales called for under the agreementremain mostly unspecified _ as is the next largest revenue source,the $5.3 billion in taxes.   Bush has said the tax money should be generated by cutting thetax rate on capital gains. But Democrats say cutting that rate is abig revenue loser in the long run, and the wealthy would benefitthe most.   In seeking to avoid the impact of the Gramm-Rudman law _ whichcalls for across-the-board spending cuts if the deficit projectionslater soar $10 billion above its $100 billion target _ the budgetsand White House agreement relied on various accounting moves.   For example:   _$850 million in payments for farmers scheduled for fiscal 1990would be moved up to before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.   _$477 million in ``savings'' is claimed by writing off foodstamps which were issued but never used.   _Credit is claimed for $88 million not spent when Congressrejected its pay raise earlier this year.</TEXT></DOC>
