Heavy fighting was reported after 1,500 Burmese troops met withstiff resistance as they battled 700 guerrillas in the Pa Loo rebelcamp.   Shells and mortar rounds rained down on the camp beginning earlytoday, but the shooting diminished as evening fell.   Burmese troops also attacked Pa Loo on Sunday. The camp is eightmiles from the Thai border town of Mae Sot.   Some Karens, who reported the casualties, fled to Thailand toescape the fighting. There were no reports of rebel casualties orany independant verification of the number of troops killed.   Karens are the largest of a dozen ethnic rebel groups that havefought for greater autonomy from Rangoon for about 40 years.   That automony was promised to them under Burma's Constitution,after independence was won from Great Britain in 1948.   Thai border police, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidBurmese troops crossed into Thailand this morning and attacked Thaipositions near the village of Mae Kong Khen, just south of Mae Sot.A Thai soldier was seriously wounded in a firefight. Three Buddhistmonks were also reported hurt as more than 100 Burmese shells landedinside Thai territory, police said.   By evening, police said about 50 Burmese troops, who had beenattempting to attack Pa Loo from behind, remained inside Thailand atMae Kong Khen, pinned down between Thai and Karen lines andprevented by both sides from moving.   The Karen sources, who demanded anonymity, said they wereconfident of withstanding the Burmese assault.   Thai police said 2,000 Karen guerrillas and Burmese civiliansfled into Thialand on Saturday as government troops seized controlof areas near Pa Loo.   Karen sources said 22 Burmese soldiers and six rebels were killedin fighting around Pa Loo between June 1 and June 10. Another 31government troops were wounded, as were 13 Karens, they said.   Fighting has raged in parts of the Karen state bordering Thailandsince the Burmese army began an intensive campaign to crush theinsurgency in October.   With larger forces and superior firepower, government forces haveoverrun five major Karen camps since December. These setbacks haveseverely disrupted the cross-border trade that finances theinsurgency.   Recent Burmese battle successes have partly been attributed tothe Thai army allowing Burmese troops to enter Thailand and attackKaren bases from behind, rebels contend. But Thailand last monthprotested a large-scale incursion by between 400 and 600 Burmesetroops who burned a village marketplace during an attack on theKaren camp at Kaw Moo Ra on May 20.   Burma expressed regret over the incident but asked Thailand notto permit insurgents to take refugee on the Thai side of the border.   Thailand has strengthened trade links with Burma since themilitary took power in Rangoon in September and is anxious to ensurethe smooth flow of official trade across the frontier.</TEXT></DOC>
