The most active stock in trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Home Shopping plunged $5.625 to close at $23.875 a share on composite volume of 3,248,200 shares. It was one of the worst batterings the often-volatile stock of the Clearwater, Fla.-based video retailer has taken in recent months.    The decline apparently reflected the market's disappointment with Home Shopping's second-quarter earnings report, released late Tuesday. As previously reported, earnings in the quarter ended Feb. 28 more than doubled to $9.3 million, or 10 cents a share, from $4.2 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales surged to $165.3 million from $39.1 million.    Although the results were sharply higher than the year before, they disappointed some analysts. &quot;We expected somewhere around an 8% or 9% profit margin after tax, and it came out at 5.6%,&quot; said Larry Gerbrandt of Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel, Calif. &quot;We expected higher revenues as well-something closer to the $200 million range.&quot;    In a prospectus filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Home Shopping said second-quarter results were hurt by a 6.5% decline in February sales from January levels, &quot;partially resulting from three fewer days in the month.&quot; What's more, the company said, February results suffered because of &quot;unusually high returns&quot; by customers &quot;of two high-volume, high-margin products -- women's furs and brand-name computers.&quot;    The prospectus said about 69.2% of the furs sales were returned &quot;because this item was not properly processed and prepared prior to shipping.&quot; It said about 47.3% of total sales of the computer were returned, &quot;the result of complications related to operating instructions.&quot;    The company said those problems caused returns to rise to 24.4% of its gross sales in February compared with the &quot;historical rate&quot; of 17.4% a year earlier. Furthermore, the problems also caused gross profit margins to fall to 41.9% in the second quarter from 47.1% in the first quarter, the company said. The second-quarter margin, however, exceeded the year-earlier margin of 40.5%.    A Home Shopping spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the filing. The latest second-quarter results boosted earnings for the six months to $18.8 million, or 21 cents a share, from the year-earlier $6.8 million, or 9 cents a share. Sales rose to $268.7 million from $63.9 million.    The prospectus also said Home Shopping &quot;would like to acquire an insurance company&quot; to offer services to its viewers, but added that it &quot;has not yet identified an appropriate acquisition.&quot; Home Shopping has previously indicated that it might expand into insurance, among other financial services. Last January, the company agreed to purchase a Baltimore thrift, Baltimore Federal Financial. That acquisition is still pending. </TEXT></DOC>
