The plan, approved Sunday by a 20-6 vote of the Israeli Cabinet,centers on elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,where the Palestinians have been engaged in a bloody uprising for17 months.   But it offers only half a loaf to the 1.7 million Palestiniansliving in the territories: Limited self-rule, not the independentstate they and the Arabs demand.   The plan also rules out talks with the Palestine LiberationOrganization and treats the proposed elections as a way ofbypassing the PLO and the estimated 3 million Palestinians livingoutside the occupied lands.   Many Arabs have expressed interest in the proposed elections,but most Palestinians insist an Israeli withdrawal must precede anyballoting.   Perhaps one of the biggest problem the Israelis face in gainingArab acceptance is the omission of any reference to Syria _repeating the fatal flaw of America's 1982 plan to resolve thecivil war in Lebanon.   There is an Arab saying, ``You can't make war without Egypt orpeace without Syria.''   Syria has a strong military force on Israel's border andextensive influence among radical Palestinian groups. It wouldnever tolerate any plan that fails to address Israel's occupationof the Golan Heights.   The Israelis captured the heights from Syria in the 1967 warwhen they also overran the West Bank and Gaza Strip and seized Arabeast Jerusalem.   Syria's influence among hardline Palestinians will grow if theIsraeli plan gains momentum, increasing its opportunities to fuelunrest among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and to punishany Arabs who seem ready to accept the Israeli offering.   The plan also ignores Lebanon and the Palestinian refugees there.   Most Arab leaders see Israel's occupation of a border strip insouth Lebanon as a major factor in that country's civil war. Manybelieve Israel intends to annex the occupied strip in order toseize water resources there.   A plan that fails to address that issue bodes continued conflictbetween Israeli and Syrian proxies in Lebanon and a de factopartition of the country _ something few, if any, Arab states wouldaccept.   By calling for a peace treaty with Jordan, the plan violates theArab gospel that no Arab state can make a separate settlement withIsrael that ignores the rights of other Arab parties _ a rule thathas helped keep Jordan from making peace with Israel for decades.   Jordan seems less inclined than ever to take such a step.   The Palestinian uprising led King Hussein to renouncesovereignty over the West Bank last year in favor of the PLO, withwhich he has since closely cooperated.   Rioting over economic difficulties that swept Jordan last monthhave turned the country's concerns inward. An unpopular settlementwith Israel would aggravate Hussein's problems by arousing thePalestinian half of his population.   The plan's reference to an ``additional Palestinian state'' inthe occupied lands hints at the hardline Israeli position that aPalestinian state already exists in Jordan _ a stand that chillsthe blood of Jordanian officials and their bedrock Bedouinsupporters.   The PLO, which has won worldwide support as the voice ofPalestinians, would accept elections only if Israel were toguarantee it a role in governing the occupied lands.   The Israeli plan expresses opposition to any Palestinian state,although it says ``all the proposed options'' for the territoriescan be discussed after a 3-year period of self-rule.   There is also no guarantee of full Israeli withdrawal from theterritories and no word on the status of Jerusalem.   Arabs see Jerusalem as the most crucial piece of occupiedterritory and the PLO has declared that the holy city will be thecapital of the independent state it has proclaimed in an arearoughly encompassing the occupied lands.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan also fails to address U.S.and Arab calls for international supervision of the elections andthe participation of the 140,000 Arabs in east Jerusalem.   For Palestinians outside the occupied lands, the plan appears tooffer them nothing more than permanent refugee status and no say inany peace talks.   Their opposition would make it extremely difficult for Lebanon,Syria, Jordan, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, all of which host sizablePalestinian populations, to accept the Israeli plan.   It would also create a large pool of desperate people witnessingthe loss of their dream of returning home: fertile territory forrecruitment of terrorists.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   John Rice, the AP correspondent in Amman, hascovered Arab-Israeli peace efforts since 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
