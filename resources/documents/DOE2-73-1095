Two natural analogs, the greenhouse effect and a major volcanicexplosion, are analyzed; and particular attention is then given to dataon the climatic effects of previous atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons,numerical models of these effects, and the effect of the Tunguska meteorfall of 1908 on the ozone layer and climate. It is concluded that, althoughthe current models contain many uncertainties, multiple nuclear explosionswould doubtless produce catastrophic changes, much more serious thanthose which would result from a doubling of the present CO{sub 2} content.Strong temporal and spatial variabilities of climate would exclude normallife or industrial activity on the planet. 110 references.</TEXT></DOC>
