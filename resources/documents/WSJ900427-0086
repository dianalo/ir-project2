British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd., a competitor ofRupert Murdoch's Sky Television, plans to beam five channelsof movies, sports, entertainment and news into U.K. homesstarting Sunday.</LP><TEXT>   British Satellite, which plans to back the launch with a#100 million ($163 million) promotional campaign during thefirst year, is delaying television ads promoting the servicebecause of shortages in the satellite-receiving equipmentviewers will need to see it. But company officials say theshortages will be short-lived. They vow that the ads, andample supplies of receivers, will come about two weeks afterthe launch.   The battle between the newcomer and Sky TV, a unit of Mr.Murdoch's News Corp., &quot;is going to be absolutely red-hotcompetition,&quot; says Anthony Simonds-Gooding, BritishSatellite's chief executive. Both satellite-TV operators willsurvive the multibillion-dollar battle, he predicts. &quot;Butonly one will be rich. The other will be a bit nearer to thebread line.&quot;   Not surprisingly, Mr. Simonds-Gooding believes his privateconsortium, backed by several Murdoch rivals, will emerge asthe rich one. He cites its hefty marketing plans, differentprogramming strategy and hopes to get satellite-receivingequipment into stores faster than Sky TV did before itsFebruary 1989 launch. &quot;We are going to win&quot; the coming skywar, he says.   Some industry watchers are much less bullish about BritishSatellite's prospects. &quot;I think BSB is now in position tolose a lot of money,&quot; says Brian Sturgess, an analyst atBarclays de Zoete Wedd, a U.K. securities firm. &quot;We are goingto have one hell of a bloody battle.&quot;   British Satellite has higher overhead than Sky TV becauseit paid more for Hollywood film rights and owns rather thanleases its satellite. British Satellite's backers -- whichinclude Pearson PLC, a diversified conglomerate that owns theFinancial Times, and publishing company Reed InternationalPLC -- are less experienced broadcasters than News Corp.,which owns U.S. television stations through its FoxBroadcasting Co. unit. And British Satellite, forced bytechnical hitches to delay its introduction from last fall,is trying to unseat an entrenched rival with a 14-month headstart.   Sky TV, which isn't yet profitable, has had its share oftroubles. Mr. Murdoch, in an interview earlier this month,said Sky TV had accumulated operating losses of #250 millionsince its February 1989 launch. Equipment shortages andconsumer confusion about the new technology meant few peoplewere watching when it began beaming TV signals to homes inBritain and Ireland.   But the Murdoch venture now is gaining wider acceptance.That's partly because of a cheap rental subscription packageintroduced last September, which analysts believe hasattracted about 400,000 households. The package, costing#4.45 a week, may appear more affordable to many people thanbuying British Satellite's equipment for #350. Throughindependent dealers, however, consumers can pay about #22 amonth to rent gear to receive the British Satellite service.   More than 800,000 U.K. homes currently receive Sky TV'sfour channels, either by satellite dish or cable, a spokesmansays. Nearly 1.4 million households in Britain and Irelandget at least one channel.   Sky TV also has begun to lure major advertisers. Six bigcompanies such as Unilever Group, the Anglo-Dutchconsumer-products giant, recently agreed to become &quot;charter&quot;advertisers. They get attractive rates in exchange foragreeing to spend #4 million each on commercials over twoyears. British Satellite is offering similar discounts forbig-spending advertisers and says it already has sold 70% ofthe air time for the first several weeks after its start-up.   Mr. Murdoch probably will devise other marketing gimmicksto repel British Satellite. Analysts speculate that he maylower the price of the discount subscription package and usehis U.K. tabloid newspapers, as he did earlier, to promotevendors' sales of satellite dishes -- or to knock theopposition. But additional newspaper promotions aren'tplanned right now, says Fiona Waters, a Sky TV official,because &quot;we are doing such heavy business on the rentalside.&quot;   British Satellite's initial marketing effort, part of athree-year #300 million drive, probably will emphasize itsBritish roots and programming tailored for U.K. tastes. &quot;Weare intrinsically British,&quot; rather than Australian orAmerican, as many Sky TV officials are, says Mr.Simonds-Gooding. For instance, he notes, the consortium'ssports channel will focus on British sporting events, incontrast to Sky TV's pan-European approach.   Sky TV also offers a 24-hour news channel, while BritishSatellite mainly will provide brief news updates on all ofits channels. An all-news channel &quot;is very expensive,&quot; Mr.Simonds-Gooding says. &quot;You want to put your money intoprograms that people want.&quot;   The consortium expects to accumulate losses of #1 billionby 1993 before reaching the break-even point. Mr. Murdochexpects Sky TV's losses to reach #350 million before hisservice reaches break-even, perhaps as soon as late nextyear.</TEXT></DOC>
