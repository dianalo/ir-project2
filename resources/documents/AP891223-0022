Hundreds of people were reported killed in the fighting.   A provisional government, apparently with the military's fullbacking, was in control in most places but still encountered fierceresistance from pro-Ceausescu security forces in several cities,Bucharest radio reported.   The popular forces took control of the communications centers onFriday and arrested key figures from the Ceausescu regime, butthere was no clear word on the fate of Ceausescu and his wifeElena, formerly the second-in-command.   The couple's son Nicu was among those held.   Shortly after 8 a.m. Saturday, Bucharest radio said allpolitical detainees had been released.   Earlier in the day, the chief of the dreaded Securitate secretpolice, Gen. Iulian Vlad told the nation on Bucharest radio thatthe Interior Ministry had rid itself of ``elements loyal to theCeaucescu clan.''   He appealed to security troops _ who long terrorized thepopulation at Ceausescu's command _ to ``serve the highest cause,namely the defense of the entire Romanian people's freedom.''   However, fighting flared in the capital at dawn Saturday,apparently between army units at television headquarters andCeausescu loyalists in surrounding apartment buildings.   About 2:30 a.m. Saturday, Ceausescu loyalists had tried to seizeradio and television headquarters _ about two miles apart _ butarmy troops repulsed the attacks.   The facilities were take by popular forces Friday and werebroadcasting declarations from the country's newly declaredprovisional government that included a vow to embrace democracy andhold free elections next year.   Heavy fighting was reported continuing Saturday in Brasov, thecountry's second-largest city. It had also reportedly been intenseFriday night in the western city of Timisoara, where the revoltbegan on Dec. 15.   On Friday morning, Ceausescu fled his presidential palace ashundreds of thousands of Romanians called for his death inretaliation for the massacre of their countrymen in a militarycrackdown unleashed a week ago in Timisoara.   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Ceausescu was hunted downand captured, although it gave no details. There was noconfirmation of the capture in Romanian media, and the whereaboutsof the man who ruled Romania with an iron fist since 1965 wereunknown.   The death toll in the uprising was believed to be in thehundreds, in addition to the thousands of civilians killed sincethe start of the unrest. Television broadcast an appeal to doctorsand medical students to go to city hospitals to help the injured.   The tumult capped a historic year of change in the Soviet blocthat elsewhere was relatively bloodless: Solidarity took power inPoland, Hungary ousted its Communist hard-liners and opened itsborders, and old-guard regimes in East Germany, Czechoslovakia andBulgaria were thrown out in swift succession.   Provisional leader Ion Iliescu appeared on Romanian TV alongwith other members of a National Salvation Committee that the mediasaid was formed to run the country temporarily. Iliescu, an oldacquaintance of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and formerForeign Minister Corneliu Manescu said free elections would besought by April.   ``In a few days we shall calm down, bury our dead and will beconsciously building new, free and democratic life,'' the Sovietnews agency Tass quoted Romanian poet Mirca Dinescu as saying.   Besides free elections, the National Salvation Committee said itwas committed to a pluralistic society; continued membership in theWarsaw Pact; the idea of a ``common European home'' _ an ideaespoused by Gorbachev; abolishment of all structures of theCeausescu dictatorship; and placement of the army and the securityapparatus under the control of the civil government.   Romanian media, now pledging honest reporting, said Ceausescuand his wife fled the palace by helicopter early Friday. The palacewas later was set ablaze.   It also was reported they had fled the country. But Tanjug saidlate Friday night that they had been captured, along with otherranking members of the old guard. It was not known where they were.   China on Saturday denied giving sanctuary to Ceausescu.   Nicu Ceausescu was shown on TV with a bloody face, his arms heldby a civilian and a man in a uniform. He was then taken away by hiscaptors.   When security forces attacked the radio and TV headquarters inBucharest during the night, occupants of the TV building ducked asshots were fired toward the windows and the lights went out.   Rebel soldiers inside returned fire, pinning down the securityforces, and repulsed the attack after about two hours.   The TV station stayed on the air during the attack, withreporter Victor Ionesco exhorting residents of Bucharest to come toscene of the shooting. ``Come help us,'' he implored. ``We'rehelping you.''   People who had been chanting outside the TV building onlyminutes before the shooting scattered briefly during the attack,but they came back and cheered when tanks on side of the uprisingtook up new positions around the building. Rebel troops also werelocated on the building's roof.   A crowd of about 3,000 people then took up a vigil through thenight outside the building, continuing their chants for liberty.   Maria Elena Ionesco, the TV reporter's wife, said the attack atthe radio station also was put down. ``It's over. We've won. We'vewon,'' she said.   Maj. Gen. Stefan Gusa, the first deputy defense minister whojoined the uprising, said on Bucharest radio Saturday morning that``the army and the people are in control of the situation, althoughthere are still scattered pockets of opposition in the country.''   A source in Timisoara said pro-Ceausescu commandos dropped byparachute had descended on the town and tanks were rolling intodowntown. Tanjug later reported the fighting had died down.   In Brasov, official radio broadcasted an urgent appeal for rebelreinforcements. Bucharest radio reported heavy fighting around thecentral telephone exchange.   The 24-year reign of the East bloc's harshest regime collapsedin one breathtaking week of protests that began with a small rallyfor a persecuted pastor in Timisoara and led to Friday's nationwideuprising by millions.   Only last month, Ceausescu was overwhelmingly reaffirmed assupreme leader by a fiercely obedient Communist Party conferencethat paid homage to his personality cult. On Thursday, during aspeech in central Bucharest, he was shouted down by jeeringdemonstrators.   After Ceausescu fled Bucharest Friday morning, hundreds ofthousands of jubilant Romanians rallied in the capital for hours,even as there were reports of fighting between rebel troops andpro-Ceausescu forces. About 2,000 pro-Ceausescu forces thenattacked the city later Friday, Romanian TV reported.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
