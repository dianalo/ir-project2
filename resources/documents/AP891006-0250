The unemployment rate was up from 5.2 percent in both July andAugust, the Labor Department said in the first comprehensive lookat the economy last month.   The report was weaker than many analysts had expected eventhough payroll declines at factories were offset by gains fromteachers returning to their classrooms and telephone workers endinga strike.   ``This report is the first in quite a while that suggests theeconomy could be heading for a tailspin,'' said economist AllenSinai of the Boston Co. ``The report was quite soft ... with meageremployment gains. Where there were big gains ... they are explainedaway by special factors.''   Reacting to the data, the stock market rallied in early trading.Brokers took sluggish job growth as a sign that the Federal ReserveBoard has more leeway to lower interest rates. The Dow Jonesaverage of 30 industrials rose 11.96 to 2,785.52 in the firsthalf-hour of trading.   ``The Federal Reserve Board has put more than 100,000 Americansout of work since March,'' charged economist Richard Rahn of theU.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``The September rise in unemployment isthe direct result of the Fed-induced economic slowdown.''   The unemployment rate for adult men jumped to 4.8 percent lastmonth from 4.4 percent in August, while the rate for women fell to4.5 percent from 4.7 percent a month earlier.   The jobless rate is derived from a survey of Americanhouseholds. A separate survey of employers showed that the economyadded 209,000 non-farm payroll jobs in September, bringing thetotal to a seasonally adjusted 109.1 million. August job growth wasonly 88,000, revised down from a previous estimate of 110,000.   September growth was artificially bolstered by the return of75,000 striking telephone workers. In the household survey,strikers are counted as employed, so their return did not affectthe unemployment rate.   The department said more industries lost than gained jobs inSeptember. Goods-producing industries, representing aboutone-fourth of the economy, was particularly hard hit, losing108,000 jobs.   Most of the loss was to manufacturing payrolls, which have beendeclining since the spring and lost 103,000 workers in September _33,000 of them in the auto industry. Thirty of 31 manufacturingindustries showed declines or were unchanged.   Construction payrolls were unchanged last month while mining,which includes oil drilling, lost 5,000 jobs.   Service industries added 317,000 jobs, bolstered by thereturning telephone workers and by a gain of 95,000 governmentjobs, most of those in local government, the likely result of thestart of a new school year.   Economists said the distribution of gains and losses follow thepattern set this year, in which workers in housing and at factoriesproducing big-ticket items such as automobiles have suffered mostfrom an earlier campaign by the Fed to fight inflation with higherinterest rates.   The central bank began easing rates in June and since thenstatistics have shown a slower, but still growing, economy in nodanger of toppling into a recession.   The unemployment rate hit a 15-year low of 5.0 percent in Marchand since then has fluctuated narrowly between 5.1 percent and 5.3percent.   ``The most disturbing feature of September's business surveydata was the large decline in manufacturing employment,''Commissioner of Labor Statistics Janet L. Norwood said in testimonyprepared for Congress' Joint Economic Committee. ``Real growth inoverall factory employment ended last March; since then, we havelost 135,000 factory jobs.''   Nevertheless, 117.5 million Americans held jobs and 6.6 millionwere looking for work in September, essentially unchanged fromAugust.   The government said average hourly earnings rose 0.5 percent to$9.73 last month after holding steady in August. For the yearending in September, average hourly earnings increased 3.8 percent,well behind the rate of consumer price inflation.   The average manufacturing work week and factory overtime edgedup 0.1 hour to 41.0 and 3.8 hours, respectively, offsetting smalldeclines in August.   Other than the swings in the unemployment rates for adult menand women, there were no dramatic shift in rates among otherdemographic groups last month, although the rate for blackteen-agers rose.   Here are the September unemployment rates for the groups listedin the Labor Department's report, compared with August:   _Adult white men, 4.2 percent, up from 3.8 percent in August.   _Adult white women, 3.8 percent, down from 4.1 percent.   _White teen-agers, 12.1 percent, down from 12.8 percent.   _Blacks, 11.6 percent, up from 11.1 percent.   _Adult black men, 10.0 percent, up from 9.8 percent.   _Adult black women, 9.6 percent, up from 9.4 percent.   _Black teen-agers, 37.3 percent, up from 31.6 percent.   _Hispanics, 8.3 percent, down from 9.0 percent.   In a separate calculation that includes military personnelstationed in the United States, the Labor Department said theunemployment rate was 5.2 percent, up from August's 5.1 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
