(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rain today forced NASA to postponeuntil Wednesday the launch of space shuttle Atlantis and itsJupiter-bound Galileo probe.   ``It appears the local weather will not cooperate, so we'regoing to have to scrub,'' launch director Bob Sieck said after the26-minute period during which Earth and Jupiter were in properalignment elapsed without a break in the weather.   Liftoff of the shuttle and its crew of five was reset for 12:50p.m. Wednesday.   With about 200 armed security guards on alert for anti-nucleartrespassers protesting against launch of the plutonium-poweredGalileo, the countdown had advanced smoothly to a point nineminutes before the designated 12:57 p.m. liftoff time.   Showers moved into an area 20 miles offshore that Atlantis wouldhave to pass through if the astronauts had to make an emergencylanding on a 15,000-foot runway near the launch pad.   NASA twice suspended the countdown, hoping the rain would pass,but time ran out.   Rain hitting a descending shuttle could severely damage thefragile fiberglass tiles that protect the vehicle from heat duringre-entry from orbit.   If the Galileo isn't launched by Nov. 21, NASA will have to waituntil 1991 before the planets are again in the right position.   The $1.5 billion Galileo is the most expensive and sophisticatedunmanned spacecraft ever built and is expected to give the bestlook yet at the mysteries of another planet.   ``It is the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft,'' said Clayne Yeates, amission manager.   The five astronauts boarded the spacecraft at mid-morning. Themission commander is Donald Williams. The others aboard were MikeMcCulley, the pilot, and mission specialists Ellen Baker, FranklinChang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.   Guards on foot, in helicopters and boats patrolled the KennedySpace Center for activists who have said they might try to stop thelaunch by infiltrating the launch danger zone. The zone covers fivemiles on either side of a line that extends 30 miles to sea.   Eight demonstrators were arrested for trespassing Monday whenthey walked through a line of security guards at a space centergate. Another was arrested today when he walked up to a gate andstepped across the space center boundary line.   The activists oppose the launch because Galileo receiveselectrical power from two generators fueled by nearly 50 pounds ofplutonium. They contend an accident a Challenger-like explosioncould scatter radioactive material over Florida.   Officials of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, whichis leading the protests, had said they would remain today inOrlando, 50 miles away, so they would not have to breatheradioactive plutonium if there were an accident.   NASA said the chances of a plutonium release are less than 1 in25,000 and even if there were a release there would be noappreciable health effects.   Last week, three groups lost a federal court lawsuit to stop thelaunch. On Monday, a three-judge appeals court panel upheld theruling.   About 6{ hours after liftoff, the astronauts were to releaseGalileo from Atlantis' cargo bay. An hour later, an attached motorwas to boost the 6,700-pound craft on a roundabout, six-year tripthat will cover 2.4 billion miles along the path to Jupiter, thelargest planet in the solar system.   Along the way, Galileo will obtain fly-by data about the moon,Venus and two asteroids, Gaspra and Ida. It will make two returnswings by Earth, to within 600 miles next year and within 200 milesin 1992. The sweeps past Earth and Venus will use the planets'gravity to accelerate the spacecraft to the proper speed to reachits distant target.   In December 1995, a 737-pound probe released from Galileo is toplunge into Jupiter's cloud layers and make the first sampling ofits atmosphere.   Galileo will orbit the planet, and its cameras and 10 scientificinstruments will gather information for about 22 months ontemperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, clouds and gravity fields.   The 1979 Voyager views of Jupiter and its satellites werebreathtaking, but Galileo's images will be up to 1,000 timesclearer, planners say.</TEXT></DOC>
