The justices ruled, 9-0, that when state taxes are foundto violate established legal principles, such as existingfederal laws or court precedents, a state must give taxpayersretroactive relief. In such cases, the state should haveknown its tax was unconstitutional, the court said.</LP><TEXT>   But in a second decision, a divided court ruled, 5-4, thatwhen a decision that a state tax is unconstitutional is basedon a change in the law, then the state's liability forcorrecting the tax isn't retroactive.   Even when retroactive relief is required, however, thatdoesn't necessarily mean refunds, the court said. In theunanimous ruling, the court said that when taxes discriminateamong different groups of taxpayers, a state must eitherprovide refunds or assess higher back taxes against those whobenefited from the illegal tax.   The net effect of the two decisions is a defeat for thestates and may cost them billions of dollars if they decideto pay refunds in a wide range of cases in which taxes weredeclared unconstitutional. The precise impact won't bedetermined until the states examine the rulings and untiladditional court rulings in other cases apply the decisionsto other taxes.   &quot;The court has given very clear guidance with respect tothe obligations of states to give meaningful relief totaxpayers,&quot; said Walter Hellerstein, a University of GeorgiaLaw School professor who was a lawyer for one of the partiesin yesterday's rulings.   Prior to the rulings, the Multistate Tax Commission, agroup of state tax officials, warned last summer that the twocases potentially could cost some 30 states where taxes havebeen declared unconstitutional about $6.5 billion in refunds.The actual figure is certain to be much lower, given thelimits the court placed on retroactivity. But there may stillbe substantial refunds by the states because local lawmakersmay find refunds politically more palatable than increasedback taxes.   In the unanimous decision, written by Justice WilliamBrennan, the court required the state of Florida toretroactively remedy an unconstitutional liquor tax that waschallenged by McKesson Corp., a San Francisco distributor.The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the tax interfered withinterstate commerce by favoring liquor made with Floridaproducts. But the Florida court declined to order retroactiverelief.   In the second case, the high court refused to makeretroactive all decisions that invalidate state taxes thatare found to interfere with interstate commerce. Thedecision, with no single majority opinion, was a victory forfive states in legal disputes with the American TruckingAssociations over highway taxes that discriminate againstout-of-state companies.   Yesterday's ruling involved the Arkansas highway tax, butother cases are pending in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New Jerseyand Vermont. The potential liability in the five states, ifthe court had required retroactive refunds, was $630.9million plus interest.   In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, thecourt said these states won't be liable for highway taxescollected before June 1987, when the justices ruled that thePennsylvania tax discriminated in favor of trucking companiesbased in the state. Before that date, the states had noreason to know the taxes were unconstitutional, the courtsaid.   The ruling means the five states aren't liable to remedythe effects of the highway taxes collected before the 1987decision. For four of the five states, that may eliminatemost of the liability because they stopped collecting theirtaxes after Pennsylvania's tax was struck down. Only Arkansascontinued to collect its tax, placing the money in an escrowaccount that is now likely to be refunded. Yesterday, theAmerican Trucking Associations said the ruling would stillentitle interstate truckers to $100 million in relief.   The most closely watched tax dispute that may be affectedby yesterday's rulings involves an issue decided by theSupreme Court last year. The high court ruled in March 1989that Michigan unconstitutionally taxed the pensions ofretired federal employees while it exempted the pensions ofstate workers. Lawsuits for refunds have been filed by formerfederal workers in 24 states, with potential refunds totaling$2 billion.   Charles Rothfeld, who filed a brief for the State andLocal Legal Center representing a number of state and localgovernment groups, said, &quot;It's not clear what theimplications of yesterday's rulings are&quot; for the lawsuitsseeking refunds of taxes on federal pensions.   Indeed, each state may reach its own decision aboutwhether to make the pensions ruling retroactive. But the highcourt yesterday said the question of whether such rulings areretroactive must be determined as a matter of federal lawnot, as some states urged, based on the laws of individualstates.   One indication of how those cases will come out may befound in the separate opinions in the Arkansas highway taxcase yesterday. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurringopinion saying he believes most court rulings should be fullyretroactive, although he wasn't willing to make the truckers'refunds fully retroactive.   Justice John Stevens dissented in the Arkansas highway taxcase, joined by Justices Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and HarryBlackmun. The dissenters said court decisions should be fullyretroactive to all cases filed within the state statute oflimitations period.   If, as seems likely, the issue of whether the federalpensions ruling should be applied retroactively comes back tothe high court, Justice Scalia and the four dissenters mightmake up a majority to say that it should.
