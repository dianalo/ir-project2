(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA officials said Tuesday theywould wait a day before deciding whether to move the space shuttleAtlantis off its launch pad, where it could be threatened byHurricane Hugo.   Space agency officials also put off a decision on whether toremove a Navy communications satellite from an Atlas-Centaur rocketon another launch pad.   Decisions on both missions were expected Tuesday, but weredelayed until Wednesday, when NASA hopes to know more about Hugo'spath.   Forrest S. McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center, saidNational Hurricane Center experts told the space officials that thepath of the storm could stay to the east of Cape Canaveral,``something in excess of 150 miles.''   Given the unpredictability of hurricanes, ``that's not assured,''McCartney said.   NASA had begun preparations to move Atlantis into an assemblybuilding if it appears that the storm might endanger the craft, hesaid.   The preparations included disconnecting fuel and electrical linesfrom Atlantis and moving a giant tracked vehicle into place to carrythe spaceplane to the assembly building. The giant tractor, called acrawler, moves at a maximum speed of 1 mph and would take at leastsix hours to cover the 4.2 miles to the building.   The Atlantis mission is scheduled for Oct. 12, when a team offive astronauts is to deploy the $1.4 billion Galileo spacecraft forits trip to the planet Jupiter. However, the launch could be delayedif Atlantis is moved.   Preparations also were made to remove the $65 millioncommunications satellite from atop the Atlas-Centaur, includingdraining the rocket's fuel tanks. Officials said the rocket shouldbe able to ride out Hugo if the storm struck here.   The Atlas-Centaur launch had been scheduled for Friday, but hasbeen delayed until at least Sunday because of the need to drain thefuel tanks.</TEXT></DOC>
