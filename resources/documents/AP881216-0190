In other developments Friday:   _Peter Winkler, a Swiss official of the International Committeeof the Red Cross who was kidnapped on Nov. 17, was released in thesouthern city of Sidon. He said he did not know who kidnapped him.Voice of Lebanon radio said Winkler was released by theFatah-Revolutionary Council, the guerrilla group headed byPalestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.   _Police said eight fighters were killed and four wounded in Sidonwhen the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia fought guerrillas ofthe Palestine Liberation Organization.   Friday's abduction was the second time in less than 24 hours thatLebanese gunmen captured Irish troops to retaliate for Israel'sseizure of Jawad Kasfi.   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said its soldiers in south Lebanonseized Kasfi, another senior local guerrilla commander and two otherguerrilla suspects in the village of Tibnin on Thursday.   Police said four gunmen in two cars seized the three Irishsoldiers in Tibnin on Friday, bundled them into a white Mercedes andsped away. The village borders on Israel's self-proclaimed securityzone.   Lebanese police said on condition of anonymity that thekidnappers demanded that the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, withwhich the three Irish soldiers served, negotiate with Israel for therelease of the four guerrilla suspects.   UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel said the U.N. force has notnegotiated with Israel so far.   ``They (Israel) acknowledged that they are holding these people.This was our only official contact,'' Goksel said. ``Of course,there was a very strong protest from UNIFIL because it was aninfringement on UNIFIL zone. But we got no response to that.''   The Israeli army identified Kasfi as a leader of the ReligiousResistance Front headed by Mustafa Dirani, a splinter faction ofAmal.   The faction is affiliated with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, orParty of God, a fundamentalist movement at odds with Amal.   The military command said Kasfi was suspected of organizing andparticipating in kidnappings and dozens of attacks against Israeliarmy forces and the allied South Lebanon Army militia since 1984.   ``The suspects are undergoing interrogation,'' the army said in astatement. ``Those ... found innocent of attacks will be released.''   Kasfi was abducted by two Israeli soldiers and three SouthLebanon Army men who drove into Tibnin in civilian cars, Lebanesepolice said. A spokesman made no mention of other captives.   Goksel said U.N. peacekeeping troops, backed by Amal militiamen,would keep searching in the area until the missing men are found.   Tibnin is 15 miles north of the Israeli border in the U.N.force's zone of operations.   The zone patrolled by the nine-nation U.N. force overlaps theIsraeli security belt, which is six to 10 miles deep and runs fromthe Mediterranean to the foothills of mount Hermon. It is designedto curb cross-border guerrilla raids.   U.N. troops ``blocked all roads in its area of operations ... inan effort to prevent the gunmen from smuggling the three Irishsoldiers out of south Lebanon,'' a police spokesman said.   Amal, which regularly cooperates with the U.N. force,``threatened to crack down on the kidnappers ``if the three soldierswere not released by nightfall,'' the spokesman said.   Asked after sundown whether Amal had taken direct action torescue the Irishmen, he said: ``No. Apparently they are stillconsidering giving peaceful efforts a chance.''   He declined to say to which group the kidnappers belonged, butsaid they are known to Amal, the U.N. force and police.   Three other Irish UNIFIL soldiers were seized on Thursday byarmed residents of Tibnin in retaliation for the kidnapping.   But they were released an hour later when Amal promised villagersthat the U.N. force would seek to locate Kasfi and bring him back.   The afternoon clashes at Sidon were touched off when twoPalestinians were killed by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Amalgunners near the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp, police said.   The battles with mortars, grenades and machine guns raged afternightfall on Sidon's southern outskirts, triggering fears of a majorconfrontation that would negate a 20-month-old Syrian-brokered truce.   Amal fought a two-year war with the Palestinians before the trucetook hold. More than 1,500 people were killed and 3,500 wounded inthe fighting, in which Syrian-backed Amal tried to prevent PLOchairman Yasser Arafat from rebuilding the Lebanon power base helost in Israel's 1982 invasion.</TEXT></DOC>
