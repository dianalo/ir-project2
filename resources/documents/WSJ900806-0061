Judge Stephen Wilson held that the Office of ThriftSupervision exceeded its authority when it made the escrowdemand last month as part of an administrative complaintagainst Mr. Spiegel. Mr. Spiegel is charged with misapplying$21 million in thrift funds for a variety of personal uses.The OTS also is seeking a $5 million civil penalty. The caseis considered the largest single civil matter that thriftregulators have brought against an individual.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Wilson held that, under relevant federal statutespassed by Congress, the OTS was limited to taking emergencyaction only in cases where there was evidence of ongoing orfuture harm to an institution, as opposed to cases in whichit was acting primarily to correct past alleged abuses. Mr.Spiegel hasn't been an official of the Beverly Hills, Calif.,thrift since last December, and thus hasn't been in aposition to affect the affairs of the institution, hisattorneys argued. The government had argued that there was athreat that Mr. Spiegel might move his assets offshore orotherwise dissipate them.   Judge Wilson also held that the order would have resultedin an unconstitutional taking of property without a hearing.   Previously, the judge had temporarily barred thegovernment from enforcing the order, and late Friday he madehis decision permanent. The government could appeal theruling. OTS officials couldn't be reached.   Rather than a major turning point in the case, thedecision is more of a public relations blow to governmentregulators' recent efforts to assume a tough-cop legalposture against operators of troubled or failed Sandamp;Ls.   Dennis Perluss, Mr. Spiegel's lawyer in Los Angeles, saidhe was &quot;delighted&quot; at the ruling. In the past, he said,thrift regulators have &quot;only been interested in takingactions before an administrative hearing that were designedto prevent future injury, such as to remove an officer. Whatwe had is a much more aggressive and far-reaching action. Ineffect, they wanted the judgment to be paid in advance.&quot;   Mr. Perluss added, however, that he understood that theOTS was considering adding charges to its complaint againstMr. Spiegel. A hearing on all charges is currently scheduledfor Sept. 4 in Los Angeles.   Columbia's insolvency reflects nearly $1 billion in lossesfrom declining values and losses in junk bonds that Mr.Spiegel and Columbia purchased, largely from Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. and junk-bond chief Michael Milken. Despite thelosses, Columbia hasn't been taken over by regulators,although a takeover is considered likely. The thrift's newmanagers recently agreed to sell the junk-bond portfolio to aCanadian investor partnership for $3 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
