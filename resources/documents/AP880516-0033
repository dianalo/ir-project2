KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate could begin debate as early asTuesday on the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty, opening arace to ratify it before President Reagan's summit with Mikhail S.Gorbachev.   Just 13 days remain before the May 29 opening of the Moscowsummit, and it is an open question whether the Senate can concludedebate on the landmark arms control pact in the time remaining.   The last pre-debate hurdle came today as the Senate's ForeignRelations, Intelligence and Armed Services committee held hearingsto examine the anti-cheating arrangements agreed to in Geneva lastweek by Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze.   Reagan wants to take a ratified treaty to the Kremlin to spurfurther arms control progress, especially on the Strategic ArmsReduction or START treaty aimed at cutting long-range nuclear armsby as much as 50 percent.   Many senators of both parties join the president in that hope.   But hope may not carry the day.   Most vote counts show that in the final tally the Senate willconsent to the ratification of the pact by an overwhelming margin,far greater than the required 67 votes.   But opponents could slow the pace of debate to a crawl,demanding votes on amendment after amendment.   The leading treaty foe, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., says he has``something like a dozen'' amendments ready for debate.   One would require the withdrawal of all U.S. military forcesfrom Europe on grounds that the treaty's required elimination ofU.S. medium-range Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missileswould leave them defenseless.   The amendment would have the effect of repudiating U.S.participation in the NATO alliance and it is unlikely to be adopted.   After a briefing on Friday by national security adviser ColinPowell, the chairmen and ranking Republican members of thosecommittees told reporters their initial reaction was that Shultzhad persuaded the Soviets to back away from unacceptablerestrictions on on-site inspection on each of nine issues raised.   But Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia saidhe would schedule debate on the treaties only after the threecommittees met and agreed the verification arrangements are in U.S.national security interests.   Byrd has promised to open debate ``immediately'' once he getsclearance from the three committees. That could mean as early asTuesday if no further snags develop.   Byrd has insisted throughout that the treaty is too important totie its consideration to ``an artificial, arbitrary, automaticcalendar deadline'' such as the date of the summit opening.   Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-range NuclearForces, or INF, treaty at their Washington summit last December. Itrequires the total elimination of U.S. and Soviet missiles with arange of between 300 and 3,400 miles.   The treaty is an arms control landmark even though by itself itrequires a reduction of only about 4 percent of the missiles insuperpower nuclear arsenals.   If ratified, it will be the first arms control treaty to go intoeffect since the Anti-ballistic Missile or ABM treaty was ratifiedin 1972.   It also is the first arms control treaty actually to reducenuclear weapons rather than to impose ceilings on how many missileseach side can possess. The reductions require the elimination of anentire class of missiles designed to carry nuclear weapons to theirtargets.   Arms control supporters hope that will open the door to the muchdeeper cuts in intercontinental strategic weapons envisioned in theSTART treaty.   The INF treaty also represents another sort of arms controlbreakthrough _ it marks the first time the Soviet Union has everaccepted any form of on-site inspection on Soviet soil to verifycompliance with an arms control agreement and detect cheating.   U.S. negotiators hope Soviet acceptance of on-site inspectionfor the INF can be used as a building-block precedent for a treatyreducing strategic long-range arms by up to 50 percent.   But such a treaty would be far more difficult to monitor becauseof the far greater number of weapons involved and because not allweapons of a single class would be destroyed.</TEXT></DOC>
