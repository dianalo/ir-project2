Also on Monday, an official report said a lieutenant general waskilled during clashes with U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. He wasthe second general to be killed in a week.   Lord Nicholas Bethell, a member of the British Parliament andthe vice chairman of the Committee on Human Rights, won theprisoners' release Thursday after meeting with President Najib,said government spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.   Bethell will arrive in Peshawar, Pakistan, on Tuesday tonegotiate the release of Soviet and Afghan government prisoners ofwar, Amani said. Bethell, translator of such Russian works asAlexander Solzhenitsyn's ``Cancer Ward,'' came to Kabul via Moscow,where he spoke with Soviet officials.   Earlier reports said Bethell would negotiate for the exchange ofSoviet prisoners for 75 guerrillas. But Amani denied these reportsand said only three guerrillas were released. He said Bethell alsowould try to secure the release of Afghan government soldiers.   During the decade-long Soviet military intervention, there weremany prisoner exchanges between the guerrillas and the Soviets.Since the Soviet pullout in February, no known exchanges have takenplace.   The Soviets say about 310 of their soldiers are missing but theguerrillas say they are holding no more than 75. The rebels say35,000 of their men are in prisons either in Afghanistan or theSoviet Union. Amani said Afghanistan is holding 2,500 guerrillas.   Amani said the released guerrillass were soldiers who had beensentenced to jail terms ranging from five to 10 years foranti-government military actions.   The released were members of the fundamentalist Moslem grouployal to Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, the royalist and conservativeMujadiddi family and the moderate Gaylani family. They had beenheld in the infamous Pulcharki prison.   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has officesin both Kabul and Peshawar, will take the rebels to Pakistan, Amanisaid.   ``This is a step forward in the process of releasingprisoners,'' he said. ``We hope a great number of prisoners will bereleased.''   The Daily Payam, the official organ of the ruling People'sDemocratic Party of Afghanistan, said guerrillas killed Lt. Gen.Ali Akbar during fighting in Kandahar province in southeasternAfghanistan. It said Akbar, a highly decorated officer, was buriedSunday on Martyrs' Hill in Kabul.   Last week, a general and several officers were killed in a planecrash near Jalalabad. The government said the crash was an accident.</TEXT></DOC>
