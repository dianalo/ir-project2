(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As a study in squad-car tedium, thesyndicated series ``The Street'' goes farther than most televisionpolice shows have dared. But some cops on the beat in New Jersey'slargest city say it still misses the mark.   Most Newark police officers interviewed recently found somethingto like about ``The Street.''   But all had criticisms of the program, which strives for grittyrealism by following the eight-hour shifts of a pair of two-officersquads. It is shot on videotape with hand-held cameras, a far cryfrom the glamorous feature-film style of shows such as ``MiamiVice.''   ``It's cheaply made and that takes away from the setting as awhole,'' said Sgt. Mitchell McGuire. ``It's giving the generalconnotation that all Newark policemen have problems.''   Donald Gabriel found the show to be a slow but not necessarilyinaccurate portrait of his job.   ``The truth is boring,'' said Gabriel, a patrolman for 25 years.``It (the show) is great for the truth but not for people waitingfor the action to happen.''   ``The Street'' is carried by stations in Los Angeles, SanFrancisco, Chicago, Miami, Detroit and Hartford, Conn., and byWWOR-TV, a station in Secaucus, N.J., that serves the New York areabut also is seen on cable in 166 markets across the country.   WWOR-TV officials say talks about prolonging the series areunder discussion, but no decision has been made. The station plansto run the series at least through the summer.   ``The Street'' tried to be different from the start, accordingto creators Dan Pyne and John Mankiewicz.   Mankiewicz, who rode with officers to get a feel for theenvironment, said his intention was not to create a cop show but ashow exploring the characters of people who work as police officers.   ``A bunch of new shows are trying to be like movies and are notserving the medium,'' Mankiewicz said. ``It's a tiny little screen.You should tell small stories.''   The officers use coarse language, engage in questionable on-dutybehavior and constantly discuss personal problems.   ``It gives the feeling that the average Newark policeman is fullof problems and needs counseling,'' said Detective Gary Prystauk.   Most of the relatively infrequent action is low-key, the resultof budget constraints and the writers' intent, Pyne said. Theproducers declined to discuss how much is spent per show, butMankiewicz said, ``We can make a show for less than Don Johnsongets for `Miami Vice.'''   ``There is a lot of time that cops spend in their car not doinganything,'' Pyne said. ``Both John and I worked on `Miami Vice,'where there is a lot of action. It's so hyper-real. Every week theyare killing people. This happens to cops maybe three times in theircareer.   ``We were interested in exploring the men and what goes on intheir mind, and this endless routine of dealing with mundanecrime,'' Pyne said.   But officers interviewed from the 1,060-member force said theirtours were not as relentlessly banal as those in ``The Street.''   Detective Fred Carter believes the show is more a flawedpersonality study than a look at the real ``street.''   ``You have to show the `street' part of it,'' said Carter.``Some days you'll deliver a baby or see someone crying and hungry.And then you have to go home.''   Carter and other officers say they did find authenticity in theshow's dialogue between officers.   ``I think it's pretty good,'' said Robert Wise, a patrolman inthe city's South District. ``It shows that we have problems andwe're trying to help people with their problems.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   SHORTER `FIRING LINE' _ William F.
