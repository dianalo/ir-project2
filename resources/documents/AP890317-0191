More than $1 billion in corn was lost in a single year becausethe U.S. crop lacked sufficient variations in genetic material, orgermplasm, according to Jack Doyle of the Environmental PolicyInstitute in Washington.   The blight was the closest American agriculture has come toduplicating the Irish potato famine of 1845-9, in which more than 1million people died of starvation.   In each case, the genetic uniformity of the potatoes and the cornmeant that virtually the entire crop was susceptible to destructionby a single enemy. If the plants had been more genetically varied,only some would have succumbed, and the losses wouldn't have been ascatastrophic.   The 1970 corn blight was the ``genetic shot heard 'round theworld,'' botanists say, because it awakened interest in germplasm.   Fully 80 percent of the cornstalks standing in American soil in1970 shared at least some of the same genetic material, Doyle said.   They all contained genes from a single corn plant with a geneticvariant that simplified the production of hybrid seeds, said DonDuvick, vice-president in charge of research at Pioneer Hi-bredInternational in Des Moines, Iowa, one of the nation's largestproducers of seed corn.   The genes from that plant also made the corn susceptible tosouthern corn leaf blight.   If breeders had used a wider variety of germplasm to breedAmerican corn varieties, many varieties would not have beensusceptible to the blight. The catastrophic losses of 1970 wouldhave been avoided.   Current American corn varieties no longer contain the geneticmaterial that made 1970 corn susceptible to the blight. But theyremain closely related genetically, and a new pest or disease thatcould exploit the shared genes might once again destroy a largeportion of the crop, experts say.   ``If that is going to happen, we'd better have some geneticvariation on hand to deal with it,'' said Peter Day, director of theCenter for Agricultural Molecular Biology at Rutgers University inNew Jersey.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, March 27</NOTE></DOC>
