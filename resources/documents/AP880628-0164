Theo Pitt Jr., chairman of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, the industry's largest lobbying group, said that theadministration bungled the deregulation of savings and loans byfailing to provide for beefed-up auditing supervision.   In a speech to the league's annual regulatory conference, Pittsaid the administration had turned down repeated requests for moreexaminers from the the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the agencywhich regulates the Sandamp;L industry.   ``It was obvious to all but those in a position to do somethingabout it that a deregulated marketplace would require a largerfederal police force,'' Pitt said.   By refusing requests for more federal examiners, Pitt said theadministration in effect ``laid out the welcome mat for the highfliers. They said: `Come on in. No one's watching.' And come theydid .. and they ran amok in the absence of government supervision.''   The savings and loan industry suffered losses totaling $3.8billion in the first three months of this year, more than half ofthe record $6.8 billin the industry lost for all of 1987.   Pitt said that poor management and depressed economic conditionsin the Southwest had contributed to the industry's woes.   But he said, ``Those that got in trouble because of fraud andmismanagement were invited to do so largely as the result of apoorly planned, poorly executed deregulation process _ at both thestate and federal levels.''   ``The administration plunged headlong into deregulation in theearly years of this decade. They went at it with a vengeance. Andthey went at it in a lopsided fashion,'' he said.   For many years, the amounts that savings and loans could paydepositors was capped, and in the 1980s those caps were graduallyremoved.   Pitt said that it wasn't until three years after the start ofinterest rate deregulation that federal officials got around togranting institutions the power to offer variable-rate mortgageloans. Pitt said this created an imbalance between the cost Sandamp;Lswere having to pay for funds and the amount they were allowed toearn on their loans which translated into an estimated loss of $12billion for the industry.   Pitt said that the legislatures in some states were at fault aswell by expanding the investment authority of their state-charteredinstitutions far beyond the traditional housing-finance mission ofthe Sandamp;L industry.   The largest number of financially troubled institutions are inTexas and California, two states where lawmakers granted Sandamp;Ls broadauthority to venture into risky investments outside of thetraditional home mortgages the industry was created to handle.   Pitt said there was a limit to how much the nation's healthySandamp;Ls could continue to pay toward making up the shortfall in theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the agency which insuresdeposits up to $100,000. Because of the Sandamp;L troubles, the insurancefund ended 1987 with a negative net worth of $13.7 billion, morethan double the deficit at the end of 1986.   Congress approved a measure to raise $10.8 billion for theailing insurance fund through the sale of bonds with the bonds tobe paid off by increased assessments on healthy Sandamp;Ls.   But Pitt said healthy Sandamp;Ls are now being asked to pay 2{ timeswhat competing banks must pay for deposit insurance.   ``What looms before us is the prospect of Vampire Economics ...a prescription for FSLIC's problems that would drain away ourcapital, the very life blood of our system of depositoryinstitutions,'' Pitt said.</TEXT></DOC>
