A 14-MeV point neutron source is used with a leadmultiplier. All the calculations are done in rectangular geometry withthe Monte Carlo code MORSE-E and Los Alamos National Laboratory's 30-groupneutron cross-section set CLAW-IV in P/sub 3/ scattering approximation.The homogeneous system gives the best and the block concept gives thelowest tritium breeding, but neither of these concepts is practical foruse in fusion blankets. Among the practical blanket arrangements, forequal amounts of natural lithium and water, the heterogeneous and multilayeredarrangements give almost identical tritium breeding.</TEXT></DOC>
