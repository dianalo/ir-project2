About 78 atomic transitions of Pr I and 43 transitionsand Pr II have been identified and their visual estimate of relativeintensities are tabulated in the spectral range 5760-6250 A. The laseroptogalvanic spectroscopy is also used to record the hyperfine structureof the 6055.13, 5874.72, 5821.36 and 5779.28 A transitions in Pr I. Thelarge hyperfine splittings of the levels involved enabled us to resolvethe hyperfine components even in the Doppler limited experiments andto obtain the hyperfine constants for the lower and upper levels involved.</TEXT></DOC>
