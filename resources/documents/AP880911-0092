Bill Clements will help dedicate a statehistorical marker Monday to commemorate the 30th anniversary of thefirst working integrated circuit, which started an electronicsrevolution and changed the face of science.   The anniversary comes as Texas itself is in the midst of a broadattempt to become the nation's center for computer chipmanufacturing and development.   Integrated circuits, which have come to be known as computerchips and are the brains behind everything from microcomputers tomusical greeting cards, first were demonstrated on Sept. 12, 1958in a laboratory at Texas Instruments Inc. headquarters.   The historic marker, to be unveiled in a 9 a.m. CDT ceremony,honors Jack St. Clair Kilby, who first demonstrated his idea thatbasic building blocks of elecronics _ capacitors, transistors andresistors _ could be built out of a single semiconductive material.   The discovery helped eliminate the expense and time needed tohand-solder electronic circuits.   Kilby, who will attend Monday's ceremony, constructed a crudeworking model from a material called germanium. He later helpedinvent a hand-held calculator developed to show the commercialpotential of the integrated circuit.   Kilby's first integrated circuit had nine components in a spaceone-sixteenth of an inch wide by seven-sixteenths of an inch long.Now, 180 billion integrated circuits later, more than 700,000components can be crammed onto a chip.   Texas itself is hitching its economic hopes to computer chipdevelopment and manufacturing.   TI announced last Thursday that it would spend $30 million inthe next six months to a year developing a prototype productionline at its Dallas headquarters for future-generation RISC chips.   Four other top chipmakers plan to help Texas become a worldcenter of chip development.   Within about an hour's drive of each other in Austin,International Business Machines Corp., Motorola Inc., CypressSemiconductor Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. all aredeveloping RISC chips. Each has established or will establish majorresearch, design and development facilities in the area.   Craig Ensley, vice president of four-year-old Austin-basedCrystal Semiconductor, told the Dallas Morning News that Texas'gains in chipmaking are proof the semiconductor industry isshifting its focus from the West Coast to Texas.   ``There's no question that by the mid-1990s, Texas will be thedominant center of gravity of the semiconductor industry in thiscountry,'' Ensley said.   In volume of chip production and number of wafer factories,Texas is second only to California and far ahead of any otherstate, according to In-Stat Inc., a semiconductor industrystatistical source in Scottsdale, Ariz.   The volume and variety of chips being made surpasses the daystwo decades ago when the semiconductor industry in the state couldbe described in two words: Texas Instruments.   TI now makes everything from the most basic ``glue logic'' chipsto the most advanced 1 million-bit dynamic random access memory _or DRAM _ chips at its 21 silicon wafer factories in Sherman,Dallas, Houston and Lubbock.   Glue logic chips are devices that hold electronic circuitstogether and permit memory chips and microprocessors tocommunicate. Semiconductors now account for 46 percent of TI'ssales and once again are setting records in unit and dollar volume.   In Carrollton, Europe's leading semiconductor company, SGSThomson Microelectronics, has resurrected what used to be known asMostek Corp. and is running its plant there six days a week. InIrving, Japan's Hitachi Semiconductor is set to begin producingDRAM chips.   Silicon Valley-based companies are found all over: NationalSemiconductor Corp. in Arlington, Cypress Semiconductor in Austin,Advanced Micro Devices in Austin and San Antonio, and VLSITechnology in San Antonio.   There also are a pair of Texas-bred start-ups: CrystalSemiconductor in Austin and Dallas Semiconductor. The two venturesmake special-purpose chips that can be found in machinery fromdigital tape recorders to gasoline pumps.   Texas also can boast the U.S. chipmaking industry's only twocooperative research efforts, Sematech and Microelectronics andComputer Technology Corp., both based in Austin.</TEXT></DOC>
