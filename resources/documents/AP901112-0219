An executive associated with the Mexican media and entertainmentconcern that is the paper's biggest shareholder has been brought into take greater control of operations at the 9-month-old newspaper.   The moves come as the paper continues to absorb heavy losses inits bid to become the United States' first national sports daily.   Backers of the newspaper have run into a miserable advertisingclimate and skepticism about the potential audience for a dailypublication devoted exclusively to sports.   Peter O. Price will continue to hold the titles president andpublisher but will be involved with broad, non-operational issues,a spokesman for the paper, Steve Hammond, said.   He said Price would be involved, for instance, in planning forthe rollout into new markets. The National is currently availablein nine markets with plans to expand into three more -Baltimore-Washington, Philadelphia and Atlanta - by early 1991.   Hammond said the three executives dismissed last week were DianeMorgenthaler, circulation director; Timothy Lasker, assistantpublisher, and Daniel W. Correa, finance and administrationdirector.   He said none of the three has yet been replaced. He describedthe changes as a ``business decision,'' but declined to elaborate.   Price has been unavailable for comment for the past severaldays. Calls placed Monday to Price and all three dismissedexecutives were not returned.   Hammond confirmed that Jaime Davila has been brought in toassume Price's operating responsibilities at the newspaper, whosebiggest shareholder is Emilio Azcarraga, the Mexican media baron.   Davila is a top executive at Univisa Inc., the U.S. subsidiaryof Mexico's Televisa entertainment and publishing concern thatAzcarraga heads.   Davila and Azcarraga were also said to be unavailable forcomment.   It was disclosed last week that The National will ceasepublishing a Sunday edition after Nov. 25 and publish only onweekdays. The paper had been publishing six days a week, Sundaythrough Friday, since its launch Jan. 31.   Editor-in-chief Frank Deford also said last week there will be ahandful of jobs cuts at the paper, which employs about 200 people,but that he was hopeful the cuts could be made through attritionrather than layoffs.   The National was launched in three cities - New York, Chicagoand Los Angeles - and has since begun publishing editions in SanDiego, San Francisco, Detroit, Dallas, Boston and Miami.</TEXT></DOC>
