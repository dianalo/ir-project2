Foamingagents were evaluated on their ability to produce ample, lasting foamand to have low loss from adsorption on reservoir rock and decompositionat reservoir conditions. Foaming agents that performed well in shaking,blender, long-term stability, and high-pressure stability tests wereselected for core-flow experiments. The stability test results demonstratedthat foaming agents are reservoir-specific. The extent of the loss dependson the foaming agent, reservoir fluids, reservoir lithology, and reservoirconditions. The core-flow experiments involved the simultaneous injectionof CO/sub 2/ into two waterflooded Berea cores. The cores were arrangedin parallel and had different permeabilities. The test temperature andpressure was constant and above the critical conditions for CO/sub 2/.Three types of core-flow tests, involving injection of CO/sub 2/ to displaceoil, injection of alternate slugs of CO/sub 2/ and brine, and injectionof foaming agents, were conducted. The foaming agents were injected beforeCO/sub 2/ injection and after CO/sub 2/ had displaced oil from the morepermeable core. The results show that in-situ foam generation is an effectivemethod for improving CO/sub 2/ displacement efficiency. Foam was mosteffective when the foaming agent was injected after CO/sub 2/ displacedthe oil from the more permeable core. The improved sweep efficiency wascaused by the tendency of the foam to be generated preferentially inthe more permeable core. The foam increased resistance to flow in thiscore and caused more CO/sub 2/ to flow through the less permeable core.The second injection method is also more applicable to field implementation.</TEXT></DOC>
