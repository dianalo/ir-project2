Mulheren Jr. admitted that he agreedto pay Ivan F. Boesky's company $790,000 even though he hadno legal obligation to make the payments, but contended itwasn't part of any illicit arrangement.   Ending two days of testimony in his own defense, Mr.Mulheren said he agreed to pay Mr. Boesky the money byinflating brokerage bills that Mr. Mulheren's former company,Jamie Securities Co., paid to Mr. Boesky's trading company inlate 1985. Mr. Mulheren said he agreed to give Mr. Boesky'scompany, Seemala Corp., the money &quot;only because they beat meup and harassed me over the telephone.&quot; He was referring toMr. Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator, andMichael Davidoff, a key aide to Mr. Boesky.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,securities and mail fraud and keeping false records. Thegovernment has alleged that Mr. Mulheren conducted numerousillegal securities trades with Mr. Boesky's company, and thatMr. Mulheren proposed a bogus scheme to compensate Mr. Boeskyfor profits on those trades. The scheme allegedly called forinflating Jamie's brokerage fees to Mr. Boesky's tradingcompany in late 1985.   But Mr. Mulheren said he agreed to pay Mr. Boesky's firmthe money because Mr. Boesky had often done him &quot;favors.&quot; Hesaid, &quot;I increased the bills&quot; to Seemala &quot;to get them back afavor,&quot; because Mr. Boesky had sold him stocks that made Mr.Mulheren's firm a lot of money. Mr. Mulheren, who ran alimited partnership, said he didn't tell any of his investorsthat he was paying the $790,000 to Mr. Boesky. Mr. Mulherensaid he often inflated brokerage bills paid to others who hadalso done him favors. &quot;I've been marking up bills for years,&quot;he said.   Clad in blue jeans and a turquoise sport shirt, Mr.Mulheren was often smug and surly when responding toquestions put to him by Assistant U.S. Attorney AlfredPavlis, a prosecutor in the case. &quot;You're a very wealthy man,aren't you, Mulheren?&quot; Mr. Pavlis asked. &quot;No, the lawyers arenow,&quot; Mr. Mulheren quipped.   &quot;Isn't it true that you invited Ivan Boesky to yourwedding anniversary&quot; in the late 1970s? Mr. Pavlis asked.&quot;Which one, there was one every year,&quot; Mr. Mulherenresponded.   Mr. Boesky's cooperation with the government led to asweeping insider-trading investigation and to thegovernment's case against the 40-year-old Mr. Mulheren. Inearlier testimony, Mr. Mulheren had tried to distance himselffrom Mr. Boesky, painting Mr. Boesky as only a casualacquaintance.   But yesterday, under cross-examination, Mr. Mulherenacknowledged that he twice told the Securities and ExchangeCommission under oath that he spoke to Mr. Boesky &quot;twentytimes a day, every day of the year.&quot; Mr. Mulheren called hisprior testimony &quot;a gross exaggeration,&quot; but added, &quot;It's nota lie.&quot;   Mr. Mulheren said Mr. Boesky had shared &quot;sensitive andconfidential&quot; information with him. He also acknowledged thathe had once hosted a charity dinner on Mr. Boesky's behalf,and that Mr. Boesky had given a donation to Mr. Mulheren'salma mater, Roanoke College, in Mr. Mulheren's name.   Three government witnesses, including Mr. Boesky, havepreviously testified that Mr. Mulheren conducted a series oftrades that were designed to generate tax losses for Mr.Boesky's trading firm and to help Mr. Boesky evade netcapital requirements. But under intense questioning by Mr.Pavlis, Mr. Mulheren insisted he never did anything illegaland never understood that profits and losses from the tradeswere to be borne by Mr. Boesky's company, as the witnesseshad said.</TEXT></DOC>
