Dome said the suit, which seeks classaction status, was filed in U.S. District Court in New York by Allen B. DeYoung, who owns 100 common shares of Dome. As an alternative to overturning the takeover, the suit seeks damages of more than $100 million.    Also named as defendants are J. Howard Macdonald, Dome's chairman and chief executive officer, and John M. Beddome, president.    Dome said the suit alleges breach of fiduciary responsibility and mismanagement by Messrs. Macdonald and Beddome. The suit also alleges that the actions of Dome, Amoco and the Chicago-based oil company's Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. unit prevented the &quot;achievement of maximum value for Dome's shareholders.&quot;    Amoco Canada signed a definitive agreement last month to acquire financially troubled Dome for $3.87 billion in cash and securities. But the accord is meeting widespread opposition from Dome's creditors, who must approve the transaction by June 30.    As previously reported, the acquisition requires Dome's creditors to forgive 1.16 billion Canadian dollars ($864.5 million) of Dome's total debt of 6.3 billion dollars. Recent talks between Amoco and Dome's creditors have centered on sweetening the terms of the securities involved in the transaction.    Dome said Mr. DeYoung's suit also seeks to overturn a provision in the takeover agreement that would allow Amoco Canada to purchase Dome's Primrose oil and gas properties in Alberta for 79 million dollars if the takeover fails.    Dome said that it expects to defend the suit vigorously and that it has been advised by counsel it has a valid defense. Neither Mr. DeYoung, whom Dome identified as a New York state resident, nor his lawyer could be reached for comment. Officials of Amoco weren't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
