Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MKC WLA </CO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   Marion Laboratories Inc. received good news and bad news about its big-selling heart drug, Cardizem.    A major long-term trial of Cardizem in heart attack patients found that the drug seemed to reduce the risk of a second, possibly fatal heart attack in patients with well-functioning hearts. But the bad news was that Cardizem increased the risk of a second heart attack in patients whose hearts were badly impaired.    &quot;Our data demonstrate that diltiazem {the generic name for Cardizem} treatment isn't appropriate for all patients after acute myocardial infarction {heart attack},&quot; a report published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine said.    Marion, which licensed Cardizem from Tanabe Seiyaku Co. of Japan, couldn't be reached for comment on the study. The drug is the Kansas City, Mo.-based concern's biggest-selling product, with sales projected to jump to more than $500 million this year from $350 million last year, according to securities analysts.    In response to the report yesterday, Marion shares fell $1.375 to close at $17.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Diltiazem is one of the so-called calcium-channel blockers that work by inhibiting the flow of calcium in and out of muscle cells, such as those in the heart. The calcium-channel blockers' main use is in the prevention of chronic chest pain, or angina, which afflicts many sufferers of coronary heart disease.    In the early 1980s, when calcium-channel blockers went into wide use, trials were begun to see if the drugs also might reduce deaths in the days and weeks after a heart attack and prevent second heart attacks.    The newly published findings are the results of a trial of diltiazem begun in 1983 with $10.8 million in funding from Marion; Tanabe Seiyaku; Warner-Lambert Co., which has certain foreign rights to the drug; and the German, Spanish and Canadian licensees of the drug. The report was issued by the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial research group, a consortium of 23 U.S. and Canadian medical centers organized to test the drug's use.    The trial, involving almost 2,500 patients who took either diltiazem or a placebo daily for one to four and a half years after their first attack, found almost no difference in total death rates between those taking diltiazem and those taking the placebo. The rates of fatal and nonfatal &quot;cardiac events&quot; were only slightly lower among those taking diltiazem.    But when the researchers looked at certain subgroups of patients, they found a major difference. In the 20% of the patients who were suffering congestion of the lungs after their inital heart attack, there was a 41% higher risk of having a fatal or nonfatal &quot;cardiac event&quot; among those taking diltiazem than among those taking a placebo. Lung congestion is a result of weakened or impaired pumping action by the heart's key lower left chamber.    In sharp contrast, among the 80% of patients without pulmonary congestion, indicating a fairly normal pumping action by the heart, the drug reduced the risk of a fatal or nonfatal &quot;cardiac event&quot; by 23% compared with the placebo.    The researchers speculated that in patients with well-functioning hearts, the drug might have reduced the spread of damage after a heart attack. In those with impaired hearts, the drug's tendency to depress the heart's functioning might have more than offset its benefits.    In the calcium-channel blocker field, diltiazem competes with nifedipine, sold by Pfizer Inc. under the name Procardia. It also competes with verapamil, sold under its generic name by some small companies; by Monsanto Co.'s G.D. Searle andamp; Co. unit under the name Calan; and by BASF AG's U.S. division, Knoll Pharmaceuticals, under the name Isoptin. Studies already have found that neither nifedipine nor verapamil reduced the incidence of postheart attack deaths or second attacks. </TEXT></DOC>
