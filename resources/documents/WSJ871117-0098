Foster Winans is that his Supreme Court case will not go down in history as a landmark inside-trading decision; some other defendant and some other victimized institution will have to play center stage in the test case that decides the &quot;misappropriation theory.&quot;    Mr. Winans, of course, sold his stock-trading accomplices advance word of what would appear in the Heard on the Street columns he wrote for this newspaper. The lower court convicted him of inside trading, holding that the law covered trades on information misappropriated from us. The heavy betting had been that the justices would use Winans to reject misappropriation, which would vastly expand who and what the inside-trading law covers. Instead, the justices split 4-4 on whether there was a securities-law violation. The lower-court conviction on inside trading stands, but without precedential value. By an 8-0 vote, the justices upheld parallel convictions on mail- and wire-fraud charges. Mr. Winans will go to jail.    The inside-trading law, though, remains as unclear as ever. The 4-4 split on the misappropriation theory is another reason to damn what happened to Robert Bork, who should have been confirmed in time to cast the deciding vote in this case. The split could mean that four justices accept the misappropriation theory; that the justices couldn't reach a consensus and decided to delay, or that they want Congress to say what the law is. Rudy Giuliani and the lawyers for Robert Freeman, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor must decide if the justices are asking for another test case.    Mail and wire fraud are themselves notoriously junky charges, used when prosecutors can't prove the underlying crime, such as bribery or tax evasion. The McNally case last term prohibited the use of these laws against politicians on vague honest-government charges. Winans goes the other way, broadening the laws in perhaps unintended ways. Note that no broker, printer or newspaper forswears the use of the mails or telephones. The odd result could be &quot;fraud&quot; convictions for stock trading under these statutes, the securities laws aside.    The silver lining to this decision is that the opinion also contains the basis for a clear-headed definition. In upholding the mail- and wire-fraud counts, the justices found their key in the simple idea that Mr. Winans had wrongfully taken property. The court said this newspaper was defrauded of the &quot;property right in keeping confidential and making exclusive use, prior to publication, of the schedule and contents of the 'Heard' columns.&quot; In short, the simplest term for what Mr. Winans did wrong is theft.    Our difficulty with the inside-trading law has always been that markets live on information, and starve without it. The undefined federal law against inside trading is congressional ambiguity inviting prosecutorial zealotry; people have been indicted on the bizarre theory that they had more information than someone else. By contrast, well-developed state laws against theft give clear, bright-line standards of right and wrong.    Now that the court has emphasized that information is property, Congress or the courts are free to move toward a definition of inside trading as theft. Clearly Mr. Winans did wrong, but the law will develop more soundly in the future if everyone understands the nature of the crime: not buying and selling stocks but stealing property. </TEXT></DOC>
