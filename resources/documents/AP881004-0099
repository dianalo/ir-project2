RepublicanBush proposed a $100 million umbrella organization to encouragevolunteerism, saying, ``I want our affluent to help our poor.''   While the two White House contenders campaigned in criticalstates _ Dukakis in Illinois and Bush in California _ the vicepresidential candidates devoted their time to preparing forWednesday night's debate.   Republican Dan Quayle, who has studied at an undisclosedlocation in Washington, D.C., was leaving today for Omaha, Neb.,for the debate, as was Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, who did his finalpreparations in Austin, Texas.   Dukakis, at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., said Bushhad failed in five missions: as part of an administration effort toincrease U.S. sales in Japan, as head of task forces on regulatoryreform, drug interdiction and international terrorism, and in aneffort to recommend banking reforms.   ``Mr. Bush was given five important missions by thisadministration and he failed every one. And that was before theyasked him to pick a running mate in this election,'' Dukakis said.   The Massachusetts governor, slightly behind Bush in recentpolls, said he was ``beginning to turn this race around.'' He saidthe final weeks would be ``tough and competitive.''   Bush, in Sacramento, Calif., proposed creation of ``YouthEngaged in Service to America,'' an organization chaired by thepresident that ``will work with existing youth programs and willput an emphasis on programs that are started in our schools.''   The organization might develop some new volunteer programs butmostly would work in partnership with programs already under way,such as Peace Corps, the California Conservation Corps and others,said Bush campaign adviser Loret Ruppe, director of the Peace Corps.   Bush said, ``I want our affluent to help our poor. I want ouryoung to help our elderly. ... I want the young men and women ofour tree-lined suburbs to get on a bus, or the subway, or themetro, and go into the cities where the want is.''   On Monday, Dukakis promised a presidency that would enforcecivil rights laws while Bush pledged support for development of aspace station in his administration.   With the election five weeks away, the Democratic presidentialnominee told black supporters on Chicago's South Side Monday nightthat the nation will be deciding between ``two different futures,two different roads to travel.''   And the choice of the GOP nominee will lead to an ``America ofprivilege _ an America where the very rich get even richer and therest of us just get by. This is George Bush's America,'' Dukakissaid.   The vice president, who earlier Monday welcomed the return ofthe space shuttle Discovery and its five-man crew, told a rally inRedding, Calif., that he is committed to the creation of anoperational space station by 1996.   ``This goal is achievable, sensible ... and we will meet thatgoal,'' Bush said.   The two candidates vowed to hold their second presidentialdebate either Oct. 13 or 14, despite the League of Women Voters'withdrawal of its sponsorship. The date will be determined by thelength of the American League baseball playoffs.   In announcing the decision, League President Nancy M. Neumancited the campaigns' control of debate format and other detailsthat would squelch any spontaneity.   ``We have no intention of becoming an accessory to thehoodwinking of the American public,'' she said.   The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, sponsors ofthe first presidential debate and the vice presidential encounter,quickly stepped in and agreed to take over sponsorship.   Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, said thegroup hopes to keep the debate in Los Angeles and was seeking helpfrom local groups to finance preparations, which the League hadestimated at $500,000.   Dukakis, in a rare appearance in the predominantly black Chicagoneighborhood, paid tribute to late Mayor Harold Washington and theDemocrat nominee's former rival for the nomination, Jesse Jackson.   Jackson is a ``great son of Chicago'' whose ``sun still shinesbrightly over all of America,'' Dukakis told the audience.   The candidate pledged that his administration would enforcecivil rights laws, provide same-day voter registration and selectjudges committed to equality.   ``We're going to aim high and enforce the civil rights laws ofthis country, not veto them; we're going to have a JusticeDepartment that will inspire us, not embarrass us; and we're goingto have an attorney general who understands what the word justicemeans,'' Dukakis said.   Earlier in the day, the Massachusetts governor stopped inDearborn Heights, Mich., where he spoke to students about drug useand helped destroy about $100,000 worth of marijuana, cocaine andheroin by throwing it into a county incinerator.   At a rally in Hartford, Conn., Dukakis responded to Bush'scharge that the Democratic nominee is a big-spending liberal.   ``The solutions we're proposing are not big-money solutions orbig-government solutions,'' Dukakis said. ``And unlike Mr. Bush'stired old ideas, they won't leave America running in place. They'llmake America the most powerful and productive country on earth.''   Meanwhile, the Democrat's campaign introduced two new adsfollowing the recent theme of ``The Packaging of George Bush.'' Theads, which show campaign advisers sitting around a table, deal withthe Reagan administration's environmental record and Bush'sdealings with Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.</TEXT></DOC>
