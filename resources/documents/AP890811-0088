Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslemfactions holding most of the 16 hostages in Lebanon.   Fadlallah did not mention any names, but his comments weresimilar to an offer made earlier this month by the RevolutionaryJustice Organization, a pro-Iranian group that holds Americanhostage Joseph Cicippio.   It said it would free Cicippio if Israel freed Sheik Abdul KarimObeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman Israel kidnapped July 28, and 450Arab prisoners. It also demanded that Israel allow 55 Palestiniansdeported in connection with the anti-Israeli uprising in theoccupied territories to return home.   During his speech, Fadlallah also praised a bombing attackcarried out by a Shiite Moslem cleric in retaliation for Israel'sabduction of Obeid.   Five Israeli soldiers and an allied militiaman were injuredWednesday when a Shiite Moslem clergyman, Sheik Asaad Birro,detonated a truck bomb as an Israeli military patrol passed insouthern Lebanon. Birro was killed.   ``Sheik Asaad Birro has, by his attack, knocked down the theoryof a security zone,'' Fadlallah said, referring to the 6- to10-mile-wide strip of land Israel carved out in south Lebanon toprotect itself from guerrilla raids.   Hezbollah also released a videotape made of Birro before theattack.   In it, Birro said, ``My operation is a gift for the nation ofHezbollah...and the heroes of the uprising against the cancerousnation (Israel).''   ``I hope it will be a modest step toward the elimination of theZionist entity,'' he added. Birro appeared nervous, stumbling onsome words as he tensely clutched a prepared text.   In Israel today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told U.S.congressmen he is optimistic Israel can negotiate the release ofmissing Israeli soldiers and American hostages in Lebanon.   Rep. John Hiler told reporters after the hour-long meeting thatShamir said ``he was hopeful what was taking place would lead tothe release'' of the captives.   The Indiana Republican attended the session with Rep. RobertClement, a Democrat from Tennessee, and Rep. William Emerson, aRepublican from Missouri. They are touring Israel as guests of theAnti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith.   Hiler quoted Shamir as saying ``there were ongoingnegotiations,'' but he gave no specifics. Officials have saidcontacts with Shiite Moslems have been made but no negotiationswere under way.   The foreign hostages include eight Americans. The hostage heldlongest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   On July 31, a pro-Iranian group claimed it killed one hostage,U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, in retaliation forIsrael's refusal to free Obeid.   Israel said it kidnapped Obeid to swap him for three Israelisoldiers held in south Lebanon and the Western hostages.   Fadlallah made his comments in a sermon marking the anniversaryof the death of Shiite Moslems' most revered saint, Imam Husseinbin Ali, grandson of the prophet Mohammed.   He was killed in 680 B.C. by Sunni Moslem armies after a 10-daysiege in Karbala, in what is now Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
