The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, skidded 31 cents to settle at $13.06 a barrel on theNew York Mercantile Exchange on Monday. The move follows a 55-centplunge in the previous session.   Crude prices, which had not closed that low since August 1986,over the past five weeks have slumped by about $2 a barrel.   Experts say consumers probably will not benefit significantlyunless crude holds at those depressed levels for an extended period.   On the exchange, wholesale unleaded gasoline prices fell 0.25cent to settle at 41.98 cents a gallon. Heating oil fell 0.95 centto end the day at 37.78 cents a gallon.   Prices moved slightly higher in early trading today, but RichardRedoglia, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, said theadvance was due to technical factors and that market ``fundamentalsare bearish.''   November West Texas Intermediate picked up 18 cents a barrel,rising to $13.24, while gasoline rose 0.42 cent to 42.40 cents agallon and heating oil was up 0.47 cent to 38.25 cents a gallon.   Monday's slide in crude intensified after Saudi Arabia, OPEC'slargest producer and the world's biggest exporter, issued a sharplyworded statement that analysts said was intended to pressure othermembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries tocurb their output levels or face continued, sharp declines inprices.   Saudi Arabia said it believes returning to prescribed productionlevels is the best way for restoring full stability to turbulentoil markets, but it will not freeze its own production while otherscontinue to violate their ceilings.   Analysts said the Saudis are intent on boosting their output todrive prices lower and make other oil producers suffer narrowingprofit margins.   OPEC nations are pumping an estimated 3 million barrels a daybeyond their 17.5-million-barrel daily quota.   ``There's a certain strategy within the Saudi camp that theywill demonstrate that you can't win by overproducing,'' said BobBaker, senio energy analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Indeed, the Saudis threatened that other OPEC members ``will nowfeel the harm of deterioration'' that overproduction has on themarket.   The statement said certain unidentified OPEC members had``perhaps forgotten the benefits of when they abided by (thecartel's) December 1986 (pricing and production) agreement, whichhelped send oil prices at least briefly to levels around $20 abarrel.''   The Saudis claim to have lost as much as $1.9 billion over theyears from repeatedly lowering their own output to bolster OPEC.With substantial resources, the Saudis can tolerate lower oilprices more easily than other nations.   With a series of OPEC committee meetings scheduled to beginlater this month, analysts caution that oil prices could rebound ifthere is any hint that members of the 13-nation cartel might reacha new accord to rein in production.   Crude prices ``would have to be depressed for quite some timebefore it works through to gas at the pumps and to heating oil,''said James Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc.   ``Gasoline stocks are low _ almost 10 million barrels behindlast year's level _ and demand is picking up slightly,'' saidAndrew Lebow, an energy analyst at E.D.andamp; F. Man International Inc.That may help to keep gas prices at current levels in the face offalling crude prices.   But experts say price stability alone is beneficial. ``Becauseconsumers' incomes are rising, stable prices can mean a cheaperproduct in real terms,'' Steel said.</TEXT></DOC>
