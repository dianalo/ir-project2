The backing comes in the form of two proposed &quot;bridge&quot; loans, temporary financing supplied from First Boston's own capital to Campeau, the Toronto-based parent of Allied Stores Corp. The loans, which are conditioned upon a merger between Campeau and Federated, are apparently the largest bridge financing made by an investment bank since the Oct. 19 stock market crash and are among the largest such loans ever.    Wall Street competitors and analysts viewed the move in part as an attempt by First Boston to recoup some of the damage to its image caused by the recent departure of its two merger aces, Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella. The disclosure of the big bridge loans to Campeau coincided with a full-page newspaper advertisement yesterday by First Boston extolling its prowess in merchant banking, in which investment banks commit their own funds to help clients.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, First Boston closed unchanged at $22.875 on volume of 50,100 shares, while Federated Department Stores closed up $3.125, at $63.75, on volume of 2.6 million shares. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Campeau closed at 22 Canadian dollars ($17.33), down 12.5 cents, on 94,314 shares.    Messrs. Wasserstein and Perella, along with more than a dozen other First Boston takeover specialists, left two weeks ago to form their own firm after a split between the pair and senior management over First Boston's direction.    &quot;One might suggest that, with the departure of Mr. Wasserstein, the firm is trying to hammer home that it's still in the merchant-banking business,&quot; said Lawrence Eckenfelder, a securities industry analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco.    Added the head of investment banking at a competing Wall Street firm: &quot;They've got to be very worried about the future of their mergers-and-acquisitions business. You're seeing them doing everything they can to reassert themselves.&quot;    James Maher, the veteran First Boston dealmaker who succeeded Messrs. Wasserstein and Perella as head of mergers and acquisitions, said the proposed loans to Campeau were part of First Boston's continuing commitment to merchant banking, and weren't linked to the advertisement. &quot;It's business as usual around here,&quot; Mr. Maher said. &quot;We're busy doing deals.&quot;    Merchant banking is especially important to First Boston, which last year derived much of its profit from takeover advising and from trading the high-yield, high-risk &quot;junk&quot; bonds that are usually used to refinance bridge loans. But merchant banking is also among Wall Street's riskiest ventures, even more so since the stock market crash and the associated problems in the junk-bond market. Most Wall Street firms have cut back their use of bridge loans since the crash.    The proposed loan to Campeau &quot;is a situation that was a slam dunk a year ago,&quot; said Mr. Eckenfelder. &quot;But today it's somewhat more risky because it's a different environment.&quot;    First Boston's move comes as defections to the newly formed Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co. finally show signs of ebbing. Seven more takeover professionals, mostly junior investment bankers, have resigned to join the new firm in the past 10 days, and several more defections are expected in coming weeks. The most visible of the latest departures was Jeffrey Rosen, a managing director who specialized in international takeovers.    So far, about 16 First Boston investment bankers have defected, and people close to the situation expect the departures to Wasserstein Perella to eventually total about 20 of First Boston's 170 takeover specialists.    First Boston has fought hard to prevent defections, holding a series of management meetings and beer-and-pretzel parties in attempts to boost morale. Somebody even handed out T-shirts emblazoned, &quot;Just Say No to Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co.&quot;    Meanwhile, Wasserstein Perella has added several blue-chip concerns to its list of clients. The firm is advising Italian industrialist Carlo De Benedetti in his bid for control of Societe Generale de Belgique, the big Belgian firm. It's also handling an as-yet unannounced transaction for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the big leveraged-buyout firm. Wasserstein Perella is also advising Henley Group Inc. and Campeau in current takeover battles, along with First Boston. </TEXT></DOC>
