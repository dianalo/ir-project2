As other options fall by the wayside in the wake of war,and particularly as the administration strains to stay out ofIraq's internal fighting, sanctions are emerging as the mainlever for influencing Iraqi behavior and dumping SaddamHussein, policy makers acknowledge. That represents an ironicreturn to the strategy the administration pursued, buteventually discarded, in the months immediately after Iraq'sAug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.</LP><TEXT>   It also portends new tensions with allies as the U.S.fights to keep economic clamps tight. And there is certain tobe fresh controversy over whether economic sanctions reallywork.   The renewed reliance on sanctions also raises an awkwardquestion: If the Bush team concluded last fall that sanctionsweren't sufficient to force Saddam Hussein out of the smallneighboring nation of Kuwait, how can sanctions possiblyforce the dictator to let go of his own nation?   The answer, administration aides say, is that the economicvise this time isn't intended to convince Saddam Hussein tolet go of power, to which he seems prepared to hang by hisfingernails. One senior administration official wrylysummarizes the situation by recalling a cartoon that shows asatisfied Saddam Hussein looking out over a scene of wreckageand destruction as far as the eye can see and proclaiming: &quot;Iregret that I have but one country to give for my life.&quot;   Instead, the economic pain is intended as a signal toeverybody around Saddam Hussein in the Iraqi army and Baathparty that the only hope for rebuilding their devastatednation is to force him out.   The vehicle for keeping the economic heat on is the UnitedNations Security Council cease-fire resolution officiallyending the war, known as Resolution 687. The long and complexresolution lays out a system for slowly lifting the sanctionsthat have forbidden nations to buy Iraq's oil and sell Iraqmost everything else.   But the system is flexible, and the administration intendsto stretch it as far as possible to keep the sanctions inplace until Saddam Hussein is out of the presidential palacein Baghdad. For now, key wartime allies support that effort;just a few days ago, French President Francois Mitterrandsaid sanctions are still needed. The question is whether Mr.Bush can keep that support if wartime memories fade,international corporations begin lusting after Iraq'sbusiness and Iraqi civilians are seen bearing the brunt ofeconomic pain and Saddam Hussein remains immovable.   &quot;For the moment they are very supportive,&quot; one Europeandiplomat says of U.S. allies. &quot;But if we see children dyingof disease and the country destroyed,&quot; he adds, publicopinion could change attitudes toward sanctions.   Under the cease-fire agreement, shipments of food andmedicine to Iraq are allowed. But the Security Council is todecide every 60 days whether to relax the ban on shipments ofother civilian goods, basing its decision on Iraq's adherenceto U.N. resolutions and &quot;in light of the policies andpractices of the government of Iraq.&quot; That gives the U.S. somuch leeway that it should always be able to find some reasonthat the embargo should remain.   Conditions for removing the ban on purchases of Iraqi oilare perhaps even tougher. The resolution declares that theSecurity Council won't allow Iraqi exports until Baghdadagrees to destroy all its missiles and chemical andbiological weapons; to destroy or relinquish all materialsthat could be used for nuclear weapons; and to forgoacquiring missiles or chemical or nuclear arms. Iraq alsomust accept a plan under which the U.N. will skim part of anyoil revenues to pay for damages caused by Iraq's invasion ofKuwait.   Those conditions are so far-reaching, and Iraq's desire tocircumvent at least some of them so likely, that it shouldn'tbe hard to find a violation justifying continuation of theoil embargo.   Already, President Bush has indicated how he intends tokeep the economic pressure on. He said last week he wouldoppose Iraq's request to sell $1 billion of oil under aspecial clause in the U.N. resolution that allows anoccasional sale to raise money for food imports. Mr. Bushsaid first he wants to see how Iraq treats Kurdish and Shiiterefugees before agreeing even to such a one-time-only sale.   Let Iraq first show that it will leave the refugees alone,Mr. Bush declared. &quot;Then,&quot; he added, &quot;I might be willing toconsider something else.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
