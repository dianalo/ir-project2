The army and the right-wing oligarchy ruled amicably; elections were stolen, the U.S. Embassy had limited influence and strikers and other protesters were shot in the streets.    Seven years of war and three elections later, El Salvador's democracy has undercut the legitimacy of the left but it has failed to build a consensus. That failure jeopardizes the hopes of U.S. policymakers to make El Salvador a Central American democratic model to be contrasted with Nicaragua's Marxist-oriented system.    Today, El Salvador's power players include the leftist guerrillas, the Christian Democratic civilian government, the army, the private sector, the right-wing opposition parties and the U.S. Embassy. Each has de facto veto power over the others on social and economic policy, and sometimes even over tactics either to win the civil war or negotiate a settlement.    &quot;When we ask ourselves what is our greatest failing, it is our inability to unify the power sectors,&quot; says an adviser to President Jose Napoleon Duarte. &quot;If we could do that . . . the war wouldn't end but its effects would be lessened.&quot;    About the only thing the non-Marxist movers and shakers can agree on is that they don't want the guerrillas to win the war. It was the private sector, not the left, that called a one-day general strike in January designed to protest the government's tax policies and attempt to force President Duarte to resign. The president held on to power, primarily because the army and the U.S. Embassy backed him. But Salvadoran businessmen further embarrassed the president by boycotting a San Salvador international trade fair.    Meanwhile, right-wing parties, which have blocked parts of the U.S.-backed land reform in the past, are boycotting the national assembly to protest Christian Democratic economic austerity measures and alleged attempts to control the national elections commission. As a result of the protest, state-of-siege regulations that suspend certain civil liberties have lapsed for lack of the required two-thirds vote.    The Salvadoran army, which believes the state of siege is vital to national security, is outraged. Speaking of the political right, and the business community in particular, Col. Alejandro Sanchez Paredes says: &quot;We believe they should act with more patriotism and not in opposition to our government. You can't separate the military from the economic and political.&quot;    A guerrilla leader in northern Chalatenango province who goes by the nom de guerre &quot;Diego&quot; laughs about the disputes in San Salvador. &quot;When we see the right deepening the crisis, we don't hold a fiesta, we decide it's time for us to deepen the crisis too.&quot;    The guerrillas say Washington, which annually pays San Salvador more than half a billion dollars to finance the war and bolster the economy, dictates here. But that isn't so. Under U.S. Embassy pressure, the army has improved its tactics and human-rights performance, but commanders continue to resist Washington's calls for legal action against officers involved in past abuses. Likewise, the U.S. Embassy has failed in efforts to urge President Duarte to devalue El Salvador's currency faster to bolster exports and to cut more public subsidies to narrow the budget deficit.    The rebels mightn't be able to win on the battlefield, but they still have a say in things. Their economic sabotage and control over some militant labor unions give them the power to subvert any government economic policy. Ironically, they also strengthen the political hand of the army by kidnapping mayors and generally making civilian local government impossible in several disputed areas.    The left says it will stop its destruction when President Duarte brings the rebels into the government and the army in an official power-sharing arrangement. That won't happen soon, if ever. But in contested zones, the guerrillas are already involved in a de facto power sharing relationship with San Salvador.    Outside the northern mountain town of El Carrizal, a young guerrilla wearing blue jeans and a sweaty t-shirt guards a roadblock, writing down the names and car registration numbers of travelers who pass through. Mailmen, health workers and teachers are allowed to enter town. The mayor, however, is prohibited entrance. The guerrillas reserve for themselves the right to try criminals as well as confiscate moonshine from local distillers. </TEXT></DOC>
