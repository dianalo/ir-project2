Japanese reports said the sum is a postwar record, but theofficial tax office declined to confirm this. Prosecutorssaid Mr. Takei's former secretary, Takatoshi Yasuda, wasarrested on similar allegations. Investigators said Mr.Takei, 70 years old, got inside information from Koshin'sleader, Mitsuhiro Kotani, that led to profits of 5.53 billionyen, after Mr. Takei lent Mr. Kotani large sums of money. Mr.Takei didn't report the income for 1987 and 1988.   The investigators said the profit included gains fromspeculation in the stocks of Iwasaki Electric Co. and KoitoManufacturing Co. Mr. Kotani is facing trial on charges ofextorting 30 billion yen from Janome Sewing Machine Co.   Last year, Forbes magazine listed Mr. Takei among theworld's billionaires, with an estimated worth topping $4billion.                                                                                                          MANILA TO LIBERALIZE INVESTMENTS                                                                                                          The Philippine Congress approved a bill allowingforeigners to own as much as 100% of most businesses in thecountry, now limited to 40%. The measure, to be signed intolaw in November, also is aimed at generating jobs forFilipinos. Separately, Manila will seek to borrow $100million from the Asian Development Bank for relending tosmall and medium industries. Meanwhile, the government willprobably shed 80% of its holding in Philippine Airlines in asingle phase this year instead of gradually.                                                                                                          SPLIT ON SOUTH AFRICA SANCTIONS                                                                                                          African leaders voted to maintain economic sanctionsagainst South Africa, yet acknowledged for the first timethese penalties could be lifted if Pretoria takes actionstoward abolishing apartheid. Defying the move by theOrganization of African Unity to continue pressure on SouthAfrica, a splinter group including Kenya and Madagascar willrestore trade and transport ties to signal support for SouthAfrica's recent political changes. Despite the OAU's toughpublic stance, black Africa's legal and illegal trade withSouth Africa is increasing and could total $4 billion thisyear, an OAU report said.                                                                                                          TERRORISM IN U.S.S.R. ON RISE                                                                                                          Terrorism, ranging from bombings to plane hijackings, isincreasing in the Soviet Union, the KGB said. It blamedethnic disputes and waning government power, and said foreigngroups were partly responsible. The Kremlin considers thesecrimes &quot;a serious threat to national security,&quot; a statesecurity official said. Killings of public officials andthreats against them are rising, he said.                                                                                                          TOKYO SCORES EC ON CARS                                                                                                          Japan faulted the way the European Community Commission istrying to solve the problem of Japanese cars in Europe,saying bargaining for quotas won't work. The commissionproposes to allow a gradual increase in Japan's share ofEurope's auto market from about 10% now to 17% by 1998, thenfully open the market. The dispute centers on Japanese carsmade in Europe. Tokyo, citing its efforts to open up to ECexports, signaled thorny talks on the auto issue.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREAN LABOR OUTLOOK                                                                                                          South Korea will have to bring in workers from othercountries if its economy grows more than 7% a year through2000, the Bank of Korea said. The bank predicted seriousmanpower shortages throughout this decade in mining andmanufacturing, worsened by the growing manpower demand in theservice sector.
