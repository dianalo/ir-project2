Meanwhile, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater calledfor a cooling down of emotions in the gun-control dispute, saying``the president feels we don't need to be threatening each other.''   He was referring to news reports that NRA officials hadindirectly threatened drug czar Bill Bennett with politicalretaliation if he pursues a course toward more firearms restrictions_ allegations that the gun owner's lobby denied anew Monday.   ``This is not a time to be threatening people, but rather a timeto try to work together to solve a problem that clearly needs to besolved,'' Fitzwater said.   While considering gun measures, Bush is also looking at moves tofight the drug problem in the nation's capital, including thepossible use of federal troops, the New York Times reported.   Bush is willing to consider bringing in the National Guard underfederal command, or using regular military forces, if the Districtof Columbia police force is unable to curb Washington's mountingmurder rate, the newspaper reported in its Tuesday editions.   The administration has not detailed how the Guard might be used,the newspaper said.   The administration last week announced it was banning the importof semiautomatic weapons. Bush had said the move reflected a ``pulsechange'' on his part on the subject of gun control, which in thepast he has steadfastly opposed.   ``Clearly there's been some evolution of his (Bush's) thinking''on gun control, Fitzwater said Monday.   Bush has directed Bennett to review the entire subject ofsemiautomatic weapons. Fitzwater said that neither an expansion ofthe ban nor other new restrictions on guns would be proposed duringthe overall review that Bennett is overseeing.   The president told his audience: ``On the NRA, of which I'm amember _ a proud member, I might add _ I believe that we can findaccommodation between the legitimate interests of the sportsman andthe interest of the police chiefs in protecting their people who puttheir lives on the line every single day.''   ``The country needs to know that there is some answer to this. Idon't yet know what it is,'' he said.   While much of the answer rests with the states, ``we have aresponsibility'' at the federal level as well, Bush said.   ``We have got to give the police proper support when they laytheir lives on the line for us. And so we'll find some answer thatis constitutionally sound and that also protects the lives, as bestone can from Washington, of police officers.''   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told The AssociatedPress last week that Bennett had been receiving warnings from therifle association through third parties hinting that NRA's campaignfund-raising abilities might be used against him if he ever soughtpolitical office.   Bennett said through a spokesman, Don Hamilton, that ``there havebeen a lot of phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off.''   Wayne LaPierre, legislative director for the NRA, insisted Mondaythat ``we never made a threat in the first place. It's not the waywe operate, it's not the way the NRA functions. I don't know how tobe any clearer than that.''   He said that the NRA shares the nation's ``heightened outrageabout violent crime'' on the nation's streets. ``We want to be apart of the solution, we're going to be in there in a constructiveway.''   But, he said in an interview, ``we don't believe we should bepushed into a cosmetic solution that won't address the real issuesand won't solve the real problems.''   ``There's nothing new about semiautomatic firearms. They've beenaround for a century,'' he said. He claimed the problem was failureto use existing laws to prosecute drug dealers who use gunsillegally. ``It's not that we don't know who these people are: theyglow in the dark.''   Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, said he had not heard aboutalleged NRA threats against Bennett but ``if they're saying thatthey shouldn't.''   ``Bill Bennett's doing a good job. The president is very seriousabout what he has had to say,'' Quayle said.</TEXT></DOC>
