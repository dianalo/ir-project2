The options available to deal with these imbalancescan be looked at from three perspectives: (i) economic criteria, includingoptions for new sources of conventional oil and gas, synthetic oil supplies,substitution for oil, renewable energy, imports and new technologies;(ii) commercial criteria, encompassing various types of commercial risk(reserves estimates, scheduling, technology, market, fiscal, financial,and so on); and (iii) political criteria, including regional economicdevelopment objectives, energy development policies, environmental regulations,and security of energy supply. The pursuit of national economic prioritiessuggests that the least-cost alternatives be pursued first. Economicpriorities may require an appropriate sharing of risks, if private risksassociated with desired energy development are unacceptable to investors.Government objectives go well beyond concern of economic efficiency intoareas of regional economic growth, diversification of supply sourcesand protection of the environment. An energy strategy will ultimatelyemerge from the balancing of all these considerations. 14 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
