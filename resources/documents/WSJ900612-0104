The BIS, which functions as a central bank for the world'smajor central banks, said the freer capital flow makes iteasier for funds to flow to economies with large tradedeficits, like the U.S., which posted a $104 billioncurrent-account gap last year.</LP><TEXT>   The BIS found that overall, capital flows increased in1989, with the biggest investments pouring toward the 12European Community countries. Total investment into the ECcame to $63 billion in 1989, up from $47 billion a yearearlier. Increased acquisitions by U.S. companies, along withgreater investment by pension funds, insurance companies andunit trusts, accounted for much of the increase. Britain,perhaps the most open to foreign investors, won $26 billionof the investment last year, compared with $6 billion forWest Germany.   The BIS said the most important developments of the decadewere unexpected ones: the collapse of communism in EasternEurope, and the durability of the economic expansion in thebig industrial countries.</TEXT></DOC>
