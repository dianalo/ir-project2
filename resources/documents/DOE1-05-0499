Six arachnoid cysts were examinedby metrizamide CT cisternography. All arachnoid cysts showed a CSF-likepattern on MRI images. In the spin echo image (SE 2000/80), the cystsshowed a similar signal intensity as the surrounding normal brain, andseparation was difficult. There were no MRI difference between communicatingand noncommunicating cysts. One low-grade glioma showing a well-definedlow density area without contrast enhancement on X-CT scans had a signalintensity higher than that of the surrounding normal brain in spin echoimages (SE 2000/80). It seems easy to differentiate a low-grade gliomafrom an arachnoid cyst, which showed normal signal intensity in spinecho images (SE 2000/80).</TEXT></DOC>
