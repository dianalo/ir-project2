(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker's former personal aidetestified Thursday in his federal tax evasion trial he didn't haveany way to prove that cash advances he took while at the PTLministry were for business use.   David Taggart said under cross-examination by prosecutor DavidBrown that proper record keeping would have helped determinewhether sums of money he drew from PTL accounts were taxable or not.   Taggart, 32, and his brother, James, are charged with evading$525,000 in income taxes after taking nearly $1.2 million in PTLmoney for their own use during a four-year period beginning in 1984.   Under questioning by defense lawyer Ben Cotten, Taggart saidthat as a vice president of the ministry, he had direct authorityfrom Bakker to take large cash advances, sign PTL checks, use PTLcredit cards and authorize bonuses for PTL employees.   Taggart said he left PTL in early 1983 because of exhaustion andjob burnout. He said Bakker and his wife, Tammy, called himnumerous times with generous offers to entice him to return.   ``He told me `David, you've killed yourself for the ministry for$25,000 a year (as assistant music director from 1978 to 1980 andfrom 1980 to 1983 as Bakker's personal assistant). Now the ministryis in a different position and I'm willing to pay you $100,000 ayear,'' Taggart said.   Taggart said he recalled telling Bakker, ``I want access to thesame resources that you have. But I also want to control my money.I don't want a house or a car to be given to me.''   Taggart said that on his return, he had authority to take largecash advances, which he said were used primarily for trips by theBakkers on ministry business. He said he needed large amounts ofcash on hand at all times.   ``Many times on a trip I would advance Tammy Bakker some cashand she would reimburse it,'' he said. That was true of dozens ofother members of the Bakkers' entourage, he said.   Taggart's brother James testified Wednesday that as PTL'sinterior designer he was an artist who left the business dealingsto his brother.   ``I always have been lax about documentation. It's never been apriority,'' David Taggart said.   Taggart's testimony came a day after Bakker invoked the FifthAmendment in refusing to answer questions in the trial. His10-minute appearance was with the jury not present.   Bakker and former top PTL aide Richard Dortch are scheduled togo on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and wire and mail fraud charges.</TEXT></DOC>
