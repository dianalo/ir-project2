KALISH</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NCR Corp., a company known for electronic cashregisters and automated teller machines, has launched a softwaresystem that marks a sharp departure from its traditional salesstrongholds, analysts said.   The ``Cooperation'' software, unveiled Tuesday at a glitzy pressconference in Manhattan's theater district, employs visualon-screen aids and other features to let users obtain informationfrom data bases, route documents and talk electronically with otheremployees.   The announcement comes three weeks after the company said itwould replace its entire computer line with industry-standardmachines that all could communicate with each other. Based on theopen system, the new software launch is designed to help acompany's computer users communicate with each other - even if theyare working on non-NCR computers.   ``Nobody can call NCR dull anymore,'' said NCR Chairman and CEOCharles E. Exley Jr. at the press conference, as he slipped on apair of bright red sunglasses outfitted with flashing lights.   The fifth largest U.S. computer maker, based in Dayton, Ohio,dominates the slow-growing banking and retail-automation marketsbut is considered a runner-up in mainstream business computers. Thenew software targets all types of companies from 50 employees andup.   ``What you're seeing is NCR coming out of their shell with thisproduct,'' said Bob Vautrain, senior research analyst at GartnerGroup Inc. ``They're trying to take an obscure $6 billion companyfrom the Midwest and take it into general-purpose computing.''   Relying on Hewlett-Packard Co.'s New Wave visual computertechnology, Cooperation is the first software product releasedunder NCR's new ``open'' computing architecture.   The product, unveiled at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, was backedby an extravagant stage show of colorful lights, screens aglow withchanging images of the product in use, and a demonstration by twocomputer operators using the software product at actual on-stagework stations.   The extravaganza was intended to build excitement among softwaremanufacturers and encourage them to write programs that can run onthe NCR system, analysts said.   ``Now that you have this great interface, you have to getsoftware manufacturers to write for it,'' said Vautrain. ``I thinkthere's a possibility it will happen.''   Exley said that Cooperation is far more comprehensive thanequivalent systems on the market, with the ability to integratethousands of standard software packages.   ``There is nothing announced at this point - much less in theform of product - anywhere as near as comprehensive,'' Exley saidin an interview following the announcement.   The software modules range from $1,700-$2,500 per user for a24-user company, but the total cost of operating the system whenthe workstations are included comes to $10,000-$12,000 per user,Exley said, noting that the cost for a 100-station company wouldtotal $1 million.   The first release of Cooperation is scheduled for next month.The product is expected to be more generally available in March.   NCR is backing the launch of its open system products with a $12million advertising campaign, starting with an ad in Wednesday'sWall Street Journal, NCR officials said. Other ads will appear inindustry trade publications.   Next week NCR is expected to elaborate how companies can employNCR's new software.</TEXT></DOC>
