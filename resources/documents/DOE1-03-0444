<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-03-0444 </DOCNO><TEXT>The work of the NEANDC Task Force on U-238 is reviewed and the progressmade in understanding the origin of the discrepancies in the neutronwidths of the resolved resonances above 1.4 keV and the capture cross-sectionbetween 1 and 30 keV is discussed. The discrepancy in neutron widthsappears to be due to the resolution function of the experiments beingwider and more complex than assumed. The capture cross-section problemmay in part be due to the incorrect normalisation of an experiment inthe keV energy range.</TEXT></DOC>
