In the letter, the firm is rudely demanding payment for abounced check on behalf of Thrifty Drug Store. You'll also notice a copy of apostal money order dated March 2 that I personally handed to the Thrifty storemanager as complete payment for that check. I called Thrifty and was told thestore shows the money order was received. Evidently this is a mistake. I wantto make sure Thrifty contacts Check Recovery Systems to let that company knowthe check had been paid. I don't want any negative report with any creditreporting bureau. Please help me straighten out this mess.;   -- N.A.M.,Sunnyvale; A  Apologies come from Dan Medrano, director of customer relationsfor the Thrifty Corp. Medrano says someone at Thrifty headquarters made amistake when the matter was turned over to Check Recovery Systems. He saysThrifty has notified Check Recovery that the check had been paid and Thriftyerred in sending over your name. He also says no negative information has beenreported to any credit reporting agency.; A COFFEE BREAK;   Q  I need areplacement coffee carafe for my 12-cup Braun coffee maker. A store I went tosays it should stock some in two to three weeks. I really don't want to gowithout my morning coffee for that long. Do you know where else I might try?;  -- D.W., San Jose; A  We bet you can find a carafe nearby by trying thedepartment stores, appliance stores or culinary stores that carry Braunproducts. But if all else fails, you can order a carafe directly from Braun inMassachusetts at (800) 272-8622. Ask for the parts department and have themodel number ready. A carafe for a 12-cup coffee maker is $19.03, includingCalifornia sales tax. (No shipping fee is charged.) You can order by Visa orMasterCard. It will take about two weeks for delivery, says a customer servicerepresentative.; BOUQUET: PURRTY SHAKEN;   Two weeks after the Oct. 17, 1989,Loma Prieta earthquake, our 10-year-old cat, Hattie, disappeared (because ofour move). July 28, 20 months later, a very kind man found her in his yard. Hechecked her collar and called me. I'm still in shock and keep looking at herwith disbelief. But you couldn't wipe the smile off my face. I only know hisfirst name, Dan. A million thank-yous to Dan and his lady.;   -- LoisMarygold, San Jose  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910822  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  541  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, August 22, 199100235092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
