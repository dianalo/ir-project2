Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, during a recentvisit to Bangkok, said Vietnam had pulled its troops back to pointsat least 19 miles from the border. Vietnam has said it began thewithdrawal from the border zone in late 1987 as a peace gesture toThailand.   The Khmer Rouge, the largest Cambodian guerrilla force, said ina broadcast that the Vietnamese statements were false.   A text of Sunday's broadcast was obtained in Bangkok on Tuesday.It said:   ``When Nguyen Co Thach released that statement, the Cambodianresistance forces and the Vietnamese aggressor troops were fightingvigorously and fiercely along the border.   ``The Hanoi troops stationed along the border fired thousands ofartillery shells into Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand, killingand wounding a number of residents.   ``At times Vietnamese soldiers even intruded into Thaiterritory, such as in the Pailin area.'' There was no independentconfirmation of the Khmer Rouge claims.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the radicalKhmer Rouge that had ruled the country since the spring of 1975 andset up another communist government.   The Khmer Rouge came to power by defeating the U.S.-backedCambodian government. During its brief rule up to 2 millionCambodians were killed in purges or died of starvation.   After the Vietnamese action the Khmer Rouge reverted toguerrilla warfare and subsequently formed a fractious resistancecoalition with supporters of Prince Norodom Sihanounk andanti-communist forces of former Premier Son Sann.   Another Khmer Rouge broadcast Sunday repeated the rejection ofrecent peace proposals and a cease-fire.   The broadcast said, ``What the Vietnamese have done is only tochange their appearance with the aim of fooling internationalopinion, but their administrative and military networks remain thesame from top to bottom in Cambodia.''   At a meeting last week in Indonesia, Sihanouk and CambodianPremier Hun Sen agreed to a Thai proposal that the Cambodianfactions observe a cease-fire before the complete withdrawal of theVietnamese from Cambodia.   Vietnam, with up to 70,000 soldiers in Cambodia, has pledged toremove all of its military forces by Sept. 30.   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan said Monday a cease-fire couldonly be part of an overall solution.   ``We cannot accept a cease-fire that keeps in place a puppetregime,'' he said of the Hun Sen government.   Hun Sen has ruled out Khmer Rouge participation in anyprovisional government.</TEXT></DOC>
