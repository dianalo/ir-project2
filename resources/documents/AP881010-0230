CD-ROMS(compact disk-read only memory) use lasers to encode and readmillions of characters of information in tiny pits on the surfaceof a disk easily able to fit into a coat pocket. First popularizedas digital recording of music that wouldn't deteriorate withmultiple plays, CD-ROM technology can bring in-the-home access tobillions of characters of information. A single disk can hold morethan 500 million characters and reference-work disks are alreadybeing published, including Grolier's Encyclopedia.   A system that would allow you to store that many characters ofinformation and change any of it at will (read-write) has yet tohit the marketplace, although at least one manufacturer, Tandy, hasannounced plans. But even at the read-only level, the ability topack so much information in such a small space holds spectacularpromise. Teaching and entertainment programs that package realisticvideo, sound and computer-aided interaction are possible on a levelformerly reserved for science fiction when the information thatwould require a hand-truck load of bound books may fit comfortablyin pocket or purse.   With the ability to store information escalating, the ability tosearch it must keep pace and the developments in hypertext softwaremay do that. As an idea, hypertext dates back to World War II andthe term itself was coined more than 20 years ago, but this is database software with a difference: it allows you to search for thingsin the same way scientists think you think, by association.   Most data bases are sequential and organized according to someartificial and fixed hierarchy, perhaps the alphabet or a numbersystem. A hypertext data base is different. Topics are linked byassociation so that an examination of the topic ``apple'' couldflow into an examination of either ``tree'' or ``fruit'' or``computer'' or ``orchards'' or ``cider,'' depending upon what youwanted to know and what questions that prompted.   A hypertext system, Hypercard, is already included with MacPlus, II and SE computers from Apple and other software isavailable for MS-DOS machines.   Finally, there is the beginning of something dubbed``interconnectivity,'' defined as the ability to get differentmachines from different mediums to work together and exchangeinformation. When you receive a facsimile transmission via thetelephone network on the facsimile board of your personal computerand use OCR (optical character recognition) software and-or ascanner to convert it into a digital form and then print the resultout on either a printer or a plotter while storing the informationon a magnetic disk, that's interconnectivity.   Interconnectivity is also cellular telephones, and MIDI (musicalinstrument digital interface) and the smart photocopy machinescalled laser printers being used for desktop publishing. It's theimages scanned from a video camera and run through graphicssoftware to produce everything from T-shirts to art.   Interconnectivity is also the beginning of order from theoften-chaotic marketplace, with the emergence of ``standards'' thatcut across more than one manufacturer's product line. Althoughstill in its infancy, interconnectivity should bring to gadgetrywhat the interstate highway network brought to personal travel _ease, speed and convenience in moving people, things and ideasacross borders.   Of course, none of the above may happen. It may be back to quillpens, parchment and candlelight, since there isn't a surefire wayto predict the future of anything as complicated as the applicationof society's technologies to individual lives. But if we continuein the directions that seem to be now the course, cornering thegoose-feather market for the next several years is probably not agreat investment.</TEXT><TEXT>   _greater than   (Larry Blasko writes ``CompuBug,'' a computer column, for theAssociated Press.
