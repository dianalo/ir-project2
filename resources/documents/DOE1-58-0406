Today, however, with the advent of various imaging techniques,X-ray computerized axial tomographs (CAT), positron emission tomographs(PET), ultrasound tomographs, nuclear magnetic resonance tomographs (NMR),just to mention a few, the images are generated by computers and displayedon computer-controlled devices; so it is appropriate to think about morequantitative and perhaps automated ways of data analysis. Furthermore,since the data are generated by computer, it is only natural to takeadvantage of the computer for analysis purposes. In addition, using thecomputer, one can analyze more data and relate different modalities fromthe same subject, such as, for example, comparing the CAT images withPET images from the same subject. In the next section (The PET Scanner)the authors shall only briefly mention with appropriate references themodeling of the positron emission tomographic scanner, since this imagingtechnique is not as widely described in the literature as the CAT scanner.The modeling of the interpreter is not going to be mentioned, since itis a topic that by itself deserves a full paper; see, for example, Pizer[1981]. The thrust of this chapter is on modeling the organs that arebeing imaged and the matching techniques between the model and the data.The image data is from CAT and PET scans. Although the authors believethat their techniques are applicable to any organ of the human body,the examples are only from the brain.</TEXT></DOC>
