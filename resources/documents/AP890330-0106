An escaped detainee remained at the U.S. Consulate inJohannesburg, a day after he eluded guards at a hospital where hewas on a hunger strike.   Prominent anti-apartheid church leaders, including AnglicanArchbishop Desmond Tutu, conferred with Law and Order MinisterAdriaan Vlok about the fate of the estimated 250 activists whoremain detained without charge, including up to 50 reportedly onhunger strikes.   ``I expect some action in the next few days,'' said the Rev.Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African Council ofChurches, who joined Tutu and two other clergymen in urging Vlok tofree all detainees.   The six former detainees who entered the British Embassy inPretoria on Wednesday expressed bitterness at Britain's refusal toprovide them with food, water and mattresses or to allow use oftoilets and telephones during their stay in an entrance hall. Theyalso said they would defy restrictions imposed on them followingtheir release from jail.   Lawyers for the six said South African authorities had givenassurances the activists would not be arrested if they left theembassy. No assurances were given that restrictions would belifted, the lawyers said.   Scores of detainees released following recent widespread hungerstrikes have been placed under restrictions, barring them frompolitical activities, confining them to their homes at night, andrequiring them to report twice daily to police stations.   British officials made clear from the start they disapproved ofthe activists' protest and asked them to leave. The six requestedBritain to pressure South African authorities to lift allrestrictions on former detainees, and the embassy replied thatBritain could make effective representations only if the sit-inended.   Tutu expressed disappointment at Britain's handling of theprotest, saying: ``I would have hoped they behaved in a way thatshowed they cared about the welfare of people.''   The National Union of Mineworkers, an anti-apartheid blackunion, described Britain's stance as ``shocking and inhuman.''   ``Denying them facilities necessary for human habitationconfirms our long-held views that apartheid repression is fullysupported by the British government for the realization of superprofits accruing from their sanction-busting companies in SouthAfrica,'' the union said.   The protest coincided with a visit to neighboring Zimbabwe byBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who urged negotiations toresolve South Africa's racial conflict.   Simon Ntombela, 27, remained in the U.S. Consulate in aJohannesburg office building after escaping Wednesday from ahospital in Durban, 360 miles away. Ntombela, a black teacher andanti-apartheid organizer, reportedly took a commercial flight toJohannesburg.   The Human Rights Commission, a private group, said Ntombela wasseeking unconditional freedom for all detainees. Before his escape,he had been on a hunger strike for two weeks.   The government said Wednesday it would place hunger strikers inprison or in hospitals in Bloemfontein, a relatively remoteprovincial center, to prevent escapes and publicity about them.   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varyingperiods under a state of emergency declared in June 1986 to quellunrest in black townships.</TEXT></DOC>
