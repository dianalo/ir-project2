Stewart</HL><DD> 10/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   The national debate over corporate takeovers and buyouts has been couched in surprisingly high-minded rhetoric given the scurrilous charges that surface in most takeover battles.    In one camp are the free-market forces: the raiders, the purveyors of junk bonds, often posturing about the American entrepreneurial spirit and the demise of the fat, lazy, &quot;corpocracy&quot; of entrenched management. In the other are some highly paid chief executives, their allies in Congress, some economists and academics, bemoaning the needless turmoil of takeovers, the waste of assets, and the alarming peril of burgeoning debt.    In &quot;The Takeover Game&quot; (E.P. Dutton, 390 pages, $19.95), John Brooks, a New Yorker magazine contributor and author of &quot;The Go-Go Years,&quot; shifts the discussion over takeovers into a less philosophical arena. Mr. Brooks's method is that of an economic historian. Reviewing the past several years of frenetic activity, he concludes: &quot;What we see is a mindless speculative merger spiral that has many of the recognizable features of a boom before a bust.&quot;    Mr. Brooks's work lacks the vivid characters and drama of some of the recent books on takeovers, but it compensates with thoughtful analysis. Indeed, it comes as a welcome change from the spate of books that have breathlessly -- and uncritically -- followed a few participants through the fast-paced machinations of a given takeover deal. Some of those accounts now seem ludicrous given the startling insider trading disclosures about Ivan F. Boesky, the former arbitrager, Dennis B. Levine, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker, and Martin A. Siegel, the former takeover specialist at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., all of whom played important roles in the takeover boom.    In Mr. Brooks's view, much of the blame for the takeover frenzy lies with investment bankers, and not just those with felonious tendencies. He begins with an account of a 1974 hostile takeover by International Nickel Co. of Canada, noteworthy not for the deal itself, but because INCO's investment bankers, the eminent firm of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., deigned to participate in a hostile bid. With that, Morgan Stanley &quot;made aggressive action respectable,&quot; says one of Mr. Brooks's unnamed sources.    At the time of Morgan Stanley's INCO raid, &quot;the face of investment banking was changing,&quot; Mr. Brooks observes. The mainstay of investment banks' business, securities underwriting, was in decline as a source of profits due to increased competition. Equally important, the whole culture of investment banking was changing, and with it the kind of people the field attracted. Gone were the &quot;old, trust-inspiring underwriter-gentlemen of proper breeding and schooling, breathing out casual charm and an air of leisure.&quot; In their place was the kind of person who, in characterizing a rival firm as &quot;lacking total greed,&quot; wasn't paying it a compliment. On the contrary, the phrase is &quot;a snide implication that the less-than-totally greedy firm still clings too sentimentally to obsolete ways,&quot; Mr. Brooks explains.    The result, perhaps inevitable, was mergers, acquisitions, takeovers and leveraged buyouts: &quot;a golden window of opportunity that promises to bring in exotic sums without tying up any capital,&quot; Mr. Brooks notes. It is a short, logical step to his conclusion, the evidence for which he concedes is &quot;circumstantial but persuasive&quot;: &quot;Corporate takeovers originate in the minds of investment bankers, and are fomented by them for the purpose of collecting huge advisory fees.&quot;    This thesis overlooks the roles of many others who benefit from takeover activity, who may be equally guilty of fomenting such transactions, and it is bound to anger many on Wall Street.    It is also likely to add impetus to congressional plans for reform and regulation of the investment-banking industry. Mr. Brooks calls for a strict prohibition of the exchange of inside information, whether or not profits result; stricter scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission of leveraged buyout proposals, as well as legislation encouraging competing bids for a company that receives a buy-out proposal; restraints on the use of credit, especially junk bonds; and major revision of the takeover laws. Not surprisingly, Sen. William Proxmire, a leader of the congressional forces for reform, endorses &quot;The Takeover Game&quot; as &quot;must reading.&quot;    But Mr. Brooks hasn't given up entirely on the free market. He is largely content to wait for the takeover &quot;bust&quot; he expects and the market's self-correcting forces.    Mr. Brooks displays a nostalgia for the gentility he believes once distinguished investment banking and a congenital distaste for the brash, sometimes vulgar, agents of change. He can hardly be faulted for fearing a descent into the kind of barbarism that threatened American capitalism in the 19th century. As he observes, &quot;it is nowhere written in stone that the law of the jungle must be the exclusive doctrine governing sorties in the world of corporate mergers.&quot;    ---   Mr. Stewart covers mergers and acquisitions for the Journal in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
