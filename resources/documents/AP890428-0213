Effective May 1, subscribers to the MCI Primetime plan announcedThursday will get to make calls from 7 p.m. until 8 a.m. thefollowing day, all day Saturdays and Sundays until 5 p.m. at $8 anhour and $6.80 for each additional hour.   After the first hour, partial hours would be billed on apro-rated, per-minute basis. Callers also would get a 10 percentdiscount for calls made at other times.   A companion plan, MCI Supersaver, allows customers to makeinterstate calls all day Saturday at $5 an hour.   The company said the Supersaver plan is the lowest-pricedcalling plan ever offered by any major long-distance company.Neither plan applies to calls inside one state.   ``It's the first to package the convenience and savings of MCIlong-distance in plans designed for when most consumers make theircalls,'' MCI President Bert Roberts said.   ``You pay for the time _ the distance is free,'' said TimothyPrice, MCI vice president for consumer sales.   Price said MCI's plan is better than the flat-rate Reach OutAmerica plan offered by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. becauseprices are 10 percent to 20 percent lower, the plan is simpler,there is no installation charge and it allows weeknight callingfour hours earlier (7 p.m. for MCI versus 11 p.m. for ATandamp;T).   Merrill Tutton, ATandamp;T's vice president for consumer services,said ATandamp;T will offer a promotion next week for Reach Out Americabut has no plans to respond directly to MCI.   ``Millions of customers have signed up for that plan'' and havestayed with it because of ATandamp;T's quality of service and incentivessuch as discounts to travelers calling home, Tutton said.   ATandamp;T on April 1 dropped daytime prices by 4.2 percent, whileevening rates dropped 0.7 percent and night-weekend pricesdecreased 0.3 percent.   Reach Out America prices dropped 2.6 percent.   Roberts said the new plan did not mean MCI was de-emphasizingthe business market. MCI's recent earnings successes has put thecompany in a position ``to accelerate our efforts in theresidential area,'' he said.   MCI reported record first quarter 1989 earnings of $128 million,compared with $58 million a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
