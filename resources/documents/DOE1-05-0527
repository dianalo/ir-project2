The''Imaging Plate'' can be used to obtain radiographs in exactly the sameway as the screen-film combination used in conventional radiography;X-rays are exposed on the ''Imaging Plate'' instead of X-ray film inthe conventional fashion, and then the ''Imaging Plate'' is calculated.The processed digital data from the scans is transformed into a pictureby means of digital-to-analogue conversion. The pictures are always clearand beautiful. Plain films of the spine taken by FCR are even clearer,even in the cervicothoracic region, where it is usually difficult toobtain clear cervicothoracic films in conventional radiography. We canobtain much precise information about the spinal posterior osteophytesand grafted bone, even when the patients are immobilized in a Halo apparatus.In myelography, the pictures are also clearer; we can see how the rootor roots are compressed, how the dura and cord are involved in patientswith cervical disc disease, and even the very narrow space between thecord and an intradural tumor. FCR is thus very useful in observing spinaldisorders, either in plain films or myelography.</TEXT></DOC>
