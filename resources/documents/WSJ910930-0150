Among them, economists warn, are keepinginflation-adjusted interest rates inordinately high, which inturn impedes economic recovery, and crowding out privateborrowers such as corporations.</LP><TEXT>   The already-huge U.S. budget deficit will continue toexpand in 1991 and beyond, because of &quot;massive debt issuanceto finance the federal costs associated with the thrift andbank failures,&quot; according to a new study of the world's bondmarket by Salomon Brothers Inc. Budget deficits are alsoexpected to widen in Japan, Germany, Britain, Italy andseveral other industrial nations. This is occurring as theU.S., Britain, Canada and parts of continental Europe aretrying to pull out of recession while the German and Japaneseeconomies are slowing.   &quot;Clearly, continued high fiscal deficits are a majorelement keeping real {inflation-adjusted} interest rates atrelatively high levels,&quot; says John Lipsky, a London-basedinternational economist at Salomon Brothers. &quot;And high realinterest rates are an important element restricting privatecredit demand and, hence, retarding the recovery.&quot;   Bond markets denominated in the currencies of 15 majorindustrial countries grew 15% in 1990 to $12.03 trillionafter growing 5.6% the year before, the Salomon report says.Excluding exchange-rate fluctuations, the 15 markets combinedrose 9%, after growing 8% in 1989.   Still, Mr. Lipsky points out that such growth is fasterthan the aggregate economic expansion of the countries whosemarkets and currencies are included in the study: the U.S.,Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Britain, Canada, Belgium,Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain,Australia and Norway.   In dollar terms, central government and government agencydebt outstanding expanded 14% in 1990, after growing 0.7% in1989 and 7% in 1988, according to the Salomon study.   &quot;Because of rising deficits, the servicing of alreadyexisting high deficits and refinancings, the saver andinvestor will have to be compensated more highly than in thepast,&quot; warns Hans-Ulrich Doerig, a Zurich-based board memberof Credit Suisse. Added to those pressures, he says, will begrowing expenditures for infrastructure and environmentalprojects around the world, spending to assist lesserdeveloped countries and eastern Europe and westerngovernments' assistance to keep the Soviet Union breathing.   &quot;The result will be structurally higher interest rates,&quot;says Mr. Doerig. &quot;Even if you have easier money from centralbanks, it doesn't mean that interest rates will fall as theydid in the past.&quot;   The Salomon study doesn't paint a bright picture ascountries try to boost economic growth, heating up thecompetition for the pool of savings world-wide. &quot;In Japan,the era of fiscal austerity appears to be giving way to moreexpansionary fiscal policy,&quot; it states. Meanwhile, Germany'spublic-sector borrowing to finance the costs of unificationsurged to 125.3 billion marks ($74.3 billion) in 1990-4.8% ofthe total output of goods and services-compared with 7.8billion marks, or 0.3% of gross national product, for WestGermany a year earlier.   In Italy, central government and agency debt alreadyaccount for a huge 84% of the domestic Italian bond market,according to the Salomon study. Britain and Australia are&quot;good examples of countries that in the late 1980s had fiscalsurpluses and have now moved into deficit,&quot; says GeoffreyDennis, an international economist at James Capel Inc.   Noting that roughly a third of Canada's budget is used topay interest on debt outstanding, one European bankerpredicts that the country's credit rating -- currentlyTriple-A -- could be downgraded if it doesn't impose fiscalrestraint and solve political problems relating to Quebec'sdesire for special status or even independence. The creditratings of several Canadian provinces have already beenlowered because of their projected debt growth.   Canadians &quot;should be very much concerned; they are livingbeyond their means,&quot; said the banker. &quot;If one-third of yourbudget goes for interest payments, how can you instituteprograms to improve international competitiveness?&quot; He addsthat taxes in Canada already are so high, politicians can'trisk raising them more.   The main impact of growing national budget deficits &quot;onthe private sector is that corporations could be crowded out,meaning that it becomes uneconomical for them to borrow atthe higher {inflation-adjusted} interest rates. That, inturn, slows economic growth, because it holds back spendingfor investment,&quot; says Mr. Dennis, of James Capel. &quot;This ishappening in an environment where companies are beingsqueezed because of banks' reluctance to lend. Just at a timethese corporate borrowers would like to float new debt, theycould be crowded out.&quot;   Amid such worries, some money managers see opportunitiesfor investors from falling nominal interest rates. &quot;From thestandpoint of short-term to medium-term investing, we thinkthere's value in all major fixed income markets,&quot; says MorrisW. Offit, chief executive officer of Offitbank, which managesfunds in global bond and money markets. He predicts that&quot;interest rates will continue to trend lower in the U.S.,&quot;and &quot;within the next six months, there's also a ride fromfalling interest rates abroad.&quot;   Investors also will be able to choose from larger,easy-to-trade bond offerings with longer maturities, theSalomon report predicts. One reason is continuing marketderegulation, particularly in Europe.   For instance, says Mr. Lipsky of Salomon: &quot;A number ofmarket reforms have made the Spanish and Italian markets moreappealing to foreign investors; that's going to continue withthe recent adoption of measures to allow nonresidents toavoid {paying} withholding taxes.&quot;   Another reason to expect more attractive bond-marketchoices is stricter bank capital requirements, which mandatethat riskier assets be backed by more capital, thus making itmore expensive and less attractive for banks to lend tocompanies. Thus, &quot;corporations will tend to rely less on thebanking system for financing and turn more to capital marketborrowing,&quot; Mr. Lipsky says.   The report also notes two contrasting trends: The volumeof foreign bonds -- those issued outside a domestic market ornot in a domestic market's home currency -- tumbled 9.2% in1990, while bonds denominated in European Currency Units --or ECU -- grew 17%.   A combination of concerns over borrowers' credit qualityand fewer profitable short-term trading opportunities becauseof more efficient markets led to the decline in offshoreissues. Also contributing to this decline was the steep dropin equity-linked bonds sold by Japanese companies, which lostfavor because of the fall in Tokyo share prices and risinginterest rates world-wide last year. By contrast, increasedECU-denominated bond offerings by European governments andsupranational agencies made that market more attractive tointernational investors.   Separately, the Salomon study says the volume ofmortgage-related bonds sold by nongovernment agencies werethe fastest growing sector of the U.S. bond market, soaring36% in 1990 from a year earlier. With $90.5 billion of thesesecurities outstanding as of June 30, Salomon estimatesofferings this year will reach a record $40 billion. Onepossible driving force behind this trend could be thatlending institutions have been scrambling to unload assetsessentially to free up capital.   &quot;These instruments are becoming more accepted byinvestors, and the Resolution Trust Corp. is becoming morevisible,&quot; says Rosario Benavides, a Salomon analyst. &quot;The RTCis currently borrowing at a rate of $2 billion to $3 billiona month&quot; to manage the financings of troubled thrift andsavings-and-loan institutions.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          A growing conviction that the economy is weak enough tojustify another easing of monetary policy caused prices oflong-term bonds to soar as yields declined to the lowestlevel in more than four years.   The bond market's bellwether security, the latest 30-yearTreasury bond, ended New York trading at 103 13/32, up 23/32from late Thursday in New York, a gain of nearly $7.50 for abond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield eased to7.82%, the lowest since 1987.   Shorter-term securities also rose. The new two-year notesauctioned Tuesday were quoted at 100 6/32, up 2/32, to yield6.02%. The notes were sold Tuesday at an average yield of6.14%. The new five-year notes, auctioned Wednesday, alsoended at 100 6/32, up 1/4, to yield 6.96%. The notes weresold Wednesday at an average yield of 7.05%.   Bonds began to rally early in the day on speculation thatthe Federal Reserve will move to cut interest rates againsoon. That view, which was reinforced by weak economicsignals such as the sharp rise in initial unemploymentinsurance claims released Thursday, gained support as FedChairman Alan Greenspan met with President Bush and hiseconomic advisers at the White House.   The Bush team emphasized the importance of breaking thechoke hold of the &quot;credit crunch,&quot; while Mr. Greenspan saidthe economy appeared fundamentally sound, White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.   The White House meeting came just days before the Fed'spolicy making Federal Open Market Committee meets to set thenear-term course for monetary policy. The group meetstomorrow.   Many analysts think the FOMC will authorize shaving anadditional 1/4 percentage point off the closely watchedfederal funds rate if September employment data, to bereleased on Friday, are weak. The federal fund rate, now at 51/4%, is the rate banks charge each other for overnightloans.</TEXT></DOC>
