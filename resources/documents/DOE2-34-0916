The scientificobjective of the research project with this equipment is to be able todeduce from extended knowledge of the details of flow and mixing processesduring gas mixture formation measures that will enable us to fulfillthe continuous demands for increased efficiency in diesel engines withconcomitant reductions of pollutant emissions and combustion noise. Furthermore,these experiments are intended to verify calculation models to the extentthat well-grounded theoretical studies on this whole range of questionscan be conducted as early as the planning stage for engines. This reportdescribes the equipment for the experiments, and the initial resultsare contained in the appendix.</TEXT></DOC>
