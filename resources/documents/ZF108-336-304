(productannouncement)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Hindin, Eric M.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>IBM's new 8209 LAN Bridge is designed to connect Ethernet LANs toIBM Token Ring backbones but can also be configured to useEthernet networks as backbones for Token Ring.andP;  It supports both4M-bps and 16M-bps Token-Ring topologies and buffers data inmemory in those rare cases when data is received faster than itcan be processed.andP;  The 8209 is not designed to provide optimumperformance on all applications; installations where users arerunning file transfer programs requiring large block sizes createpotential bottlenecks because Ethernet's maximum frame size is1,500 bytes.andP;  The bridge sells for $6,265 and requires a mandatory$935 Ethernet attachment module.andP;  Virginia Polytechnic Institute,one of te first 8209 LAN Bridge buyers, reports that its two unitshandle all requirements well.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   International Business Machines Corp.
