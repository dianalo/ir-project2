The ship, the Admiral Makarov, was 300 miles north of PointBarrow and would be able to move toward the whales today afterfinishing work on establishing a research station on the ice andrescuing an ice-trapped Soviet ship, the Arseniev, the message said.   The offer was made in the event the three gray whales still aretrapped by the gathering ice next Wednesday, when the Sovietsanticipated the icebreaking ship could arrive at the scene.   Campbell Plowder of Greenpeace said that as a shot in the dark,he asked on Monday, through scientific contacts in the SovietUnion, if any Soviet icebreaker was in a position to help thewhales. The answer was Friday's cable.   The Soviet message, which requests Greenpeace's help inobtaining U.S. government permission to sail in U.S. territorialwaters, expresses some doubts about the success of the mission.   ``We do not have complete assurance in this venture because ofshallow waters for icebreaker in the area of rescue,'' the messagesaid. In addition, the Soviets said, the ``ice ridge is about 120miles from that area and we are in doubts ... that whales would beable to pass through the channel made by icebreaker.''   Plowder said he has asked the State Department for immediateclearance for the ship to enter U.S. waters and was told thedepartment would ``assess the technical aspects'' first.   The State Department, meanwhile, said it has asked Sovietauthorities what assets they may have available to help free thewhales.   The Soviets responded with information on where they have icebreakers and how long it would take them to arrive at the scene,said a State Department official who asked not to be identified.   According to the official, U.S. authorities are evaluating theSoviet information and are comparing it with other options forrescuing the whales.</TEXT></DOC>
