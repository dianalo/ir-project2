The insoluble residue consists of chlorite,montmorillonite, illite and kaolinite with alternating layers enrichedin chlorite or montmorillonite. These fluctuations in the character ofinsoluble residue correspond to fluctuations of the record of oxygenisotopes and foraminiferal assemblages (paleoclimate) and of carbonatemineralogy (sea level). During glacial periods, insoluble residue concentrationis high, dolomite is present and quartz, plagioclase and chlorite concentrationsincrease. During interglacial periods, insoluble residue concentrationis low, dolomite is absent and quartz, plagioclase and chlorite concentrationdecreases while montmorillonite concentration increases. The source ofthe insoluble residue is dust derived from North Africa and transportedby the Saharan Air Layer coupled with the Northeast Trades. During glacialperiods, the source of the dust is the dolomite-rich southern North Africaregion. This shift of the dust source suggests that the trade winds transportingthe dust during glacial periods also shifted southward or expanded orboth.</TEXT></DOC>
