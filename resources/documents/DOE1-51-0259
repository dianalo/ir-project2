The chlorofluorocarbondebate has reopened because recent scientific findings have indicatedthat the compounds pose more of an immediate threat to the environmentand human health than was previously believed. While recognizing thisthreat, industry argues that the cost of further regulation will meanhigher prices and therefore decreased US international competitiveness.These conflicting concerns have lead to renewed action both inside andoutside government in the US and abroad.
