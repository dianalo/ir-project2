L. No. 100-86), relating to so-called nonbank banks. CEBAamended the definition of ``bank'' in the Bank Holding Company Act (the``BHC Act'' or the ``Act'') to include certain banking institutions thathad previously been outside that definition (so called ``nonbank banks'').CEBA also contained a grandfather provision that permitted nonbanking companiesthat controlled nonbank banks as of March 5, 1987, to retain control ofthe institution and not be treated as a bank holding company for purposesof the BHC Act if the company and its subsidiary nonbank bank observe certainrestrictions. These limitations generally restrict nonbank banks from commencingnew activities or certain cross-marketing programs with affiliates afterMarch 5, 1987, increasing their assets at an annual rate of more than 7percent during any 12-month period commencing after August 10, 1988, orpermitting overdrafts by affiliates or incurring overdrafts on behalf ofaffiliates at a Federal Reserve Bank. 12 U.S.C. 1843(f) (2) and (3).To implement these limitations, the rules and interpretation: (1) discusshow the term ``activity'' will be applied; (2) clarify the scope of thecross-marketing limitation; (3) describe how compliance with the 7 percentannual asset growth rate will be determined; and (4) define the restrictionson overdrafts.This rule also amends the definition of ``bank'' in Regulation Y to reflectthe changes in that definition made by CEBA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This regulation is effective September 28, 1988,except for andSection; 225.52 which will be effective January 1, 1989, andandSection; 225.145, which will be effective October 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>For information regarding andSection;andSection;225.2, 225.51 and 225.145, contact J.

This new definitioncovers certain institutions that had not previously been covered by theBHC Act (``nonbank banks'') and prevents banking and nonbanking companiesfrom forming new nonbank banks.CEBA also contains a grandfather provision that permits a nonbanking companythat controlled a nonbank bank on March 5, 1987, to retain the nonbankbank and not be treated as a bank holding company if the company and itssubsidiary nonbank bank observe certain limitations designed to preventunfair competition with banks owned by bank holding companies and to reducerisks posed to the payments system by nonbank banks. With certain limitedexceptions, the grandfathered parent company may not after March 5, 1987,acquire control of an additional bank or thrift institution or more than5 percent of its assets or shares. The grandfathered nonbank bank may not_(1) Engage in any activity after March 5, 1987, unless it was lawfullyengaged in that activity as of March 5, 1987;(2) Offer or market products or services of an affiliate that are not permissiblefor bank holding companies under the BHC Act or permit its products orservices to be offered or marketed by an affiliate engaged in activitiesnot permissible for bank holding companies under the BHC Act, unless thespecific cross-marketing activity was conducted as of March 5, 1987, andthen only in the same manner as conducted as of that date;(3) Permit an overdraft (including an interday overdraft) by an affiliate,or incur an overdraft in its account at a Federal Reserve Bank on behalfof an affiliate; and(4) Increase its assets at an annual rate of more than 7 percent duringany 12-month period beginning after August 10, 1988.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 12 U.S.C. 1843(f) (2) and (3).On June 3, 1988 (53 FR 21,462, June 8, 1988), the Board issued for commentproposed rules to implement these provisions of CEBA. In response to thisrequest for comment, the Board received 92 public comments from interestedindividuals and organizations. Approximately 52 percent of these commenters(48) favored adoption of the regulations as proposed or with slight modifications.Forty-two of the commenters opposed the proposed regulations and suggestedthat they be substantially changed before being adopted as final rules.During the regulatory comment period, the Board received several requestsfor a hearing. In response to these requests, the Board conducted a full-dayinformal hearing on July 29, 1988, to permit interested parties an additionalopportunity to express their views on the proposal. The comments on theproposal received during the comment period and the informal hearing aresummarized below.The comments generally centered on the proper interpretation of the Congressionalpurposes in enacting CEBA and the appropriate degree of restrictivenessin the implementation of CEBA's limitations.  Commenters in favor of the proposed rule, principally from banking organizationsand their trade groups, argue that the CEBA limitations should be adoptedas written and that the impact of the rules on nonbank banks should notbe ameliorated by administrative action. In their view, it was the overwhelming,if not uniform, view of Congress that nonbank banks present a serious potentialfor damage to the nation's banking system and that the CEBA limitationswere intended to restrict the operations of nonbank banks in order to preventto the extent possible these adverse effects, even at the risk of makingnonbank banks less competitive or viable. For example, the chairman ofthe Senate Banking Committee stated that in establishing the CEBA restrictions,Congress rejected the testimony of nonbank banks that these limitationswould impair competition, impede desirable innovation, jeopardize banksafety and soundness and increase risk to the FDIC. These commenters contend,based upon the statutory findings in CEBA, that the proposed rule properlyimplements the legislative intent to hold nonbank banks in place untilCongress can formulate a permanent policy.  Comments unfavorable to the proposed rule, predominantly from the affectednonbank banks, interpret CEBA and its legislative history as reflectinga balancing approach intended to permit nonbank banks to be competitive.They contend that, although Congress chose to constrain grandfathered nonbankbanks in significant and unprecedented ways, the limitations were not intendedto be implemented in such a manner as to prevent nonbank banks from continuingto compete in the marketplace. These commenters maintain that the actualbalance achieved by CEBA cannot be fully appreciated unless the languageof the statute is considered in light of its legislative history, includingparticularly, statements by the chairman of the Senate Banking Committeeduring the Senate's consideration of CEBA.  As explained in the interpretive ruling, the Board resolved this issuewith respect to particular provisions of the CEBA limitations with referenceto the terms of the statute and the stated intent of the statute to minimizethe potential for conflicts of interest, unsound banking practices, unfaircompetition, partiality in the credit-granting process and other adverseeffects that would be associated with the grandfathered affiliations offederally insured nonbank banks and companies engaged in activities forbiddento regulated bank holding companies. Based on the statutory findings, theBoard has not accepted the view of the unfavorable commenters that thenonbank bank restrictions must be applied to permit nonbank banks to maintaintheir unique competitive position.  The principal issues raised by the comments and at the public hearing regardingthe proposed rules and the Board's resolution of these issues are discussedin the following sections as well as in the interpretative ruling: 1. <T3>Activity Limitation: </T3>CEBA provides that a nonbank bank may not_<ITAG tagnum="20">engage in any activity in which such bank was not lawfully engagedas of March 5, 1987 * * * 12 U.S.C. 1843(f)(3)(B)(i).</ITAG>The proposed rule defined the term ``activity'' as applying to discretelines of banking or nonbanking business and, consistent with legislativehistory of the provision, pointed out that this definition did not envisiona product-by-product approach. To implement this definition, the proposedrule focused on five major categories of activities: deposit taking, lending,trust services, payment and clearing services, and nonbanking activities.Within these categories, examples of separate activities were set forthfor purposes of applying the grandfather limitation. For example, deposit-takingactivities were separated into demand deposits, non-demand checkable deposits,and time or savings deposits; and lending was divided into commercial lendingand types of consumer lending (credit card, mortgage banking and otherconsumer loans).  Favorable comments considered these differentiations to be consistent withthe express language in the statute and representative of recognized linesof banking or nonbanking activity, although some commenters urged the Boardto narrow certain of the activities.  Commenters unfavorable to the proposal characterized the approach as beingoverly narrow and contradictory of legislative intent not to define activityon a product-by-product or customer-by-customer basis. In their view, Congressonly intended to prevent grandfathered entities from becoming full-servicebanks or altering their basic character. As an alternative, these commentsgenerally proposed to delete the subcategories within each major categoryof banking activity except where further differentiation was necessaryto prevent a nonbank bank from becoming a full-service commercial bank.Thus, the commenters would favor the following categories based on so-called``core'' banking activities: (1) deposits (differentiating between demanddeposits and other deposits), (2) lending (differentiating between commercialloans and other types of lending), (3) trust services (including productsand services incidental thereto), and (4) nonbanking (or non-core banking)activities permissible for the bank under state law, such as travel agency,real estate development or general insurance brokerage. Some of these commenterswould also include clearing and payment services, as a separate activity,while others regarded this activity as incidental to offering transactionaccounts. For the reasons stated in the interpretive ruling, the Board believes theterm activity should be interpreted and applied with reference to priorBoard and judicial precedent regarding this term as it appears in section4 of the BHC Act, except in instances where CEBA requires modificationof this analysis, as in the case of deposit-taking and lending activities.This approach is implemented through the following revised major categoriesof activities: deposit taking, lending, trust services and other activitiesconsistent with recognized activities under section 4 of the BHC Act.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Payment and clearing services, which were considered asa separate category of activity under the original proposal, have beendeleted as a separate activity and will be considered under the generalprinciples set out in the interpretation regarding other activities. Deposit-taking would include three activities: demand-deposit taking, non-demanddeposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means forpayment to third parties, and other time and savings deposit-taking activity.Thus, an institution that did not offer demand or other transaction accountson March 5, 1987, could not begin to offer these services after March 5.As explained in the interpretation, consistent with the Board's decisionsunder the activity provisions of section 4, lending would include the followingactivities: commercial lending, consumer mortgage lending, consumer creditcard lending and other consumer lending.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Board's decisions under section 4 have not generallydifferentiated between types of commercial lending. Accordingly, the Boardbelieves that commercial lending should be viewed as a single activityunder the CEBA limitation. Some commenters stated that deposit-taking activity should be broken downonly to reflect the distinction in the ``bank'' definition before CEBAbetween demand deposits and other deposits and that the Board should nottreat non-demand transaction accounts as a separate activity. They relyon the fact that in <T3>Board of Governors </T3>v. <T3>Dimension Financial Corp.,</T3>\4\<NOTE/> the Supreme Court held that NOW accounts may not be treatedas a ``deposit that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand''under the pre-CEBA bank definition. As explained in the interpretive ruling,the treatment of transaction accounts as a separate activity from non-transactionaccount deposit-taking is consistent with the structure of the BHC Act,Board decisions regarding the term activity in section 4, and banking practice.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 474 U.S. 361 (1986). In this regard, the Board notes that the <T3>Dimension </T3>decision did not overturn the Board's decision thatthe taking of NOW accounts was a separate activity under section 4 of theAct. The decision ruled only that a NOW account was not ``a deposit thatthe depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand'' in the pre-CEBAbank definition in the BHC Act. Indeed, in CEBA, Congress amended the bankdefinition in the BHC Act to treat the taking of transaction accounts asseparate and distinct from the taking of non-transaction deposits, thusrecognizing that transaction deposits have characteristics such that theyshould be viewed in the same manner as demand depsoits for purposes ofthe bank definition and not as traditional non-checkable savings or timedeposits. This distinction between these types of deposits was carriedover into the credit-card, trust company and certain other exceptions fromthe Act's definition of bank. The Board believes these amendments supportthe view that transaction accounts are a separate activity in the caseof a nonbank bank that did not offer such a service as of March 5, 1987.The Board has also considered the views of certain commenters that thereference in the proposed rules to section 225.25(b) of the Board's RegulationY as a guide for defining activities other than lending or deposit servicesis inappropriate in that these provisions identify activities that theBoard considers to be closely related to banking. These commenters contendthat CEBA's activity restrictions, on the other hand, are applicable tocore banking services and not activities closely related thereto. Theyalso state that many of the activities identified in Regulation Y are incidentalelements to core banking functions and should not be considered separateactivities under CEBA. Moreover, the nonbanking activities list contains,for these commenters, duplication and overlap. Other commenters, includingnonbank banks, stated that use of this regulation as a reference pointfor activities under CEBA was appropriate. As noted in the interpretive rule, if Congress had intended the activitylimitation in CEBA to distinguish only between demand deposit and commerciallending activity, Congress would have used the restriction it used in anothersection of CEBA dealing with nonbank banks owned by bank holding companies,which has this result. <T3>See </T3>12 U.S.C. 1843(g). In accordance with the ordinary meaningof the term, the placement of the CEBA activity limitation in a sectionof the Act dealing with the activities of banking organizations, and thelegislative history of the provisions, the Board believes the view of theterm set out in the interpretive ruling is appropriate. The Board believes that the commenters are mistaken in their view thatreference to the activity limitation of section 4 is not appropriate inthe case of activities conducted by banking companies. The Board's decisionsand regulations under section 4 authorize deposit-taking, lending and associatedbanking functions for companies that do not qualify as banks, but, likethe nonbank banks, are federally insured, operate under bank thrift orother depository institution charters, and exercise many of the powersof banks. See <T3>e.g. U.S. Trust Corporation, </T3>70 Federal Reserve Bulletin 371 (1984);<T3>Citizens Fidelity Corporation, </T3>70 Federal Reserve Bulletin 231(1984); <T3>Citicorp/Fidelity Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, </T3>68 FederalReserve Bulletin 656 (1982). Finally, the Board also notes that the courtshave set out standards by which one activity would be viewed as incidentalto another under section 4. <T3>National Courier Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>Board of Governors, </T3>516 F.2d 1229 (1975). (a) <T3>Meaning of ``Engaged In''. </T3>Under the proposed rule, a nonbankbank must demonstrate that it had a program in place to provide a particularproduct or service associated with the grandfathered activity to a customerand that it was in fact offering the product or service to the customeras of March 5, 1987. Comments in favor of this proposal stated that itcarried out the Congressional intent of placing limitations on the activitiesof grandfathered entities by requiring an established program rather thana program in its planning stages. Unfavorable comments to the proposalstated that the rule should permit more flexibility in its concept of programand offered various approaches that were less formal than the standardproposed. Several commenters expressed concern over the proposed rule'sprovision that an isolated transaction may not be sufficient to demonstratethat a grandfathered entity was engaged in a particular activity as ofthe grandfather date. In their view, this statement suggests that the Boardis imposing a quantitative test.The Board believes that the rule as proposed requires the appropriate degreeof formalization in the marketing activities of a grandfathered entityto carry out the legislative intent that an activity must be ``engagedin'' in order to qualify for grandfathered treatment. The Board also notesthat this interpretation is consistent with the meaning given the term``engaged in'' in other provisions of section 4 of the BHC Act. The isolatedtransaction example stated in the rule is not a quantitative test becausethe rule expressly states that it would be insufficient unless evidencewas presented indicating the existence of a program associated with thetransaction.(b) <T3>Meaning of ``As Of''. </T3>The rule as proposed stated that the grandfatherdate ``as of March 5, 1987'' as used throughout section 4(f)(3) shouldrefer to activities engaged in on March 5, 1987, or a reasonably shortperiod of time preceding this date not exceeding 13 months. This periodof time is expressly confirmed by the legislative history during colloquyin the Senate debates. Proponents commented that this approach was consistentwith the legislative history. Certain opponents, on the other hand, commentedthat this period was too short and should be generally more comprehensivein scope to include, for example, promotional activities or activitiesthat had received regulatory approval.In this instance, the Board finds that the legislative history providesthe necessary clarification on the appropriate scope of the grandfatherdate and that the proposed rule accurately reflects the Congressional intentof the provision.The interpretation has been clarified, however, to provide that a nonbankbank may not commence an activity that it had terminated within this period.For example, a nonbank bank that had terminated commercial lending to avoidbank status within 13 months of March 5, 1987, could not recommence thatactivity after March 5, 1987.2. <T3>Cross-Marketing Limitation: </T3>CEBA's second limitation prohibitsgrandfathered nonbank banks from offering or marketing an affiliate's productsor services unless they would be permissible for bank holding companies,or permitting the bank's products or services to be offered or marketedby an affiliate engaged in impermissible nonbanking activities. This prohibitionis subject to a grandfather provision for cross-marketing activities engagedin as of the March 5 grandfather date, but only in the same manner as conductedas of that date. Unlike the activity limitation, which applies to separatelines of business, the language of the statute specifies that the cross-marketinglimitations apply to products or services.At the outset, it is important to note that the cross-marketing restrictiondoes not limit in any manner the direct marketing activities of nonbankbanks. Moreover, the restriction does not prevent a nonbank bank from marketingany product or service of an affiliate that bank holding companies mayoffer or from permitting the bank's products and services to be offeredor marketed by affiliates engaged in activities permissible for bank holdingcompanies.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Thus, for example, a nonbank bank may offer permissiblecredit-related insurance products of an affiliated insurance company. Similarly,the bank may offer any of its products and services through an affiliateengaged only in permissible activities, for example, through an affiliatedconsumer finance or mortgage banking company.(a) <T3>Products or Services. </T3>The interpretation published for commentdid not attempt to define ``product or service,'' but rather illustratedthe application of the grandfather provision with an example that a securitiescompany that marketed automobile loans from an affiliated nonbank bankon the grandfather date could not begin to offer checking accounts withoutloss of the privilege. The draft interpretation also made clear that aninstitution could change the terms and conditions of the product, referringto the statement of the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee duringthe debates on CEBA that a nonbank bank offering a three-year certificateof deposit through an affiliate could thereafter market a one-year certificateof a different amount and interest rate. 133 Cong. Rec. S3959 (daily ed.March 26, 1987).Proponents of the proposed rule have stated that the express statutoryfocus of the cross-marketing limitations on specific products and servicessupports a narrow view of the limitation's scope. These commenters alsoargue that this approach is entirely consistent with the stated Congressionalintent of the provision to prevent unfair competition with banks controlledby bank holding companies that may not offer such services and with thelegislative history in which the broader approach for activities discussedabove is contrasted with the more restrictive product-by-product approach.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ During the Senate debate on CEBA, Chairman Proxmire stated:<ITAG tagnum="28">The word `activity' is not defined in the bill, however, I want toconfirm that the meaning stated in the report is what is intended and thatno effort to measure activity unduly narrowly on a product-by-product,customer-by-customer basis is intended, so that if a nonbank bank wereengaged in offering any type of loans on March 5, it may offer that sametype of loan thereafter. 133 Cong. Rec. S4054-5 (daily ed. March 27, 1987).</ITAG>Opponents have countered that a narrow approach to the definition of productand service would be inconsistent with legislative intent and would limitinnovation and competition. In their view, Congress intended product orservice to be defined in functional terms and to be permitted to be changedin its character and design in response to market and technological innovations.\7\<NOTE/> Under this approach, incidental aspects of products may bechanged and enhancements may be developed. Finally, some comments suggestedthat the limitation should not apply to joint-marketing activities suchas utilizing customer lists or back-office facilities that do not involveany public identification of the affiliate relationship in conducting theactivities. The Board was also requested to provide for grandfathered treatmentunder the cross-marketing provisions if a grandfathered affiliate is reincorporatedor otherwise subject to a corporate restructuring.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ These commenters rely on Chairman Proxmire's confirmationduring the Senate debate on CEBA of Senator Dodd's understanding that underthe cross-marketing restriction:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ In this regard, the Board notes that the legislative historyindicates that the grandfather exception to the cross-marketing restrictionapplies ``only to a specific company that was engaged in the activity asof March 5, 1987. An affiliate that was not engaged in a given joint-marketingactivity as of March 5, 1987, may not commence that activity even if itwas being conducted by another affiliate as of March 5, 1987.'' S. Rep.No. 100-19, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 34-35 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="25">A grandfathered nonbank bank that was cross-marketing a specific productor service could at any time in the future cross-market a product or servicewhich had been developed to reflect general changes in the grandfatheredservice's or product's character and design generated by competition, marketinnovation or technology. 133 Cong. Rec. S3957 (daily ed. March 26, 1987).</ITAG>The Board believes that the cross-marketing limitation in CEBA by referencingparticular products and services is by its terms more restrictive in scopethan the activity limitation. In this regard, the Board notes that allor nearly all of the commenters agree that an affiliate marketing one typeof loan from a nonbank bank before the grandfather date would not be entitledto offer or market any other type of loan. The commenters, however, disagreeover the precise degree of specificity required by CEBA's use of the termproduct or service. Some commenters have maintained that this formulationrequires a narrow definition which, for example, distinguishes betweenautomobile loans and boat loans. Other commenters have argued in favorof a general functional approach that would permit a product to evolvefrom one type of consumer lending to another type of consumer loan in responseto market changes.One commenter cited as an example of a change that would justify expansionof grandfathered cross-marketing the fact that after the changes in taxlaws in 1986, many lines of credit offered by banks that were accessibleby credit card or other means began to be secured by a home mortgage, sothat the interest paid by the borrower is deductible for income tax purposes.This commenter stated that if a nonbank bank was cross-marketing creditcards on the grandfather date, it should consequently now be allowed tocross-market consumer home equity lines of credit.As set forth more fully in the interpretive rule, the Board believes thatthe term product or service must be interpreted in light of its acceptedordinary commercial usage and the Congressional purpose underlying thelimitation to minimize the potential for unfair competition and other adverseeffects. To provide guidance as to the manner in which the limitation willbe applied, the interpretation provides examples of the types of productsand services covered by the cross-marketing restrictions in the areas ofdeposit-taking and lending. In other areas, the rule provides that thedetermination as to what constitutes a product or service will have tobe made on a case-by-case basis consistent with the general principlesset out in the interpretation.The interpretation permits general changes in the character of a productor service as the result of market or technological innovation to the extentthat these modifications do not transform the grandfathered product intoa new product. In the Board's view, however, this approach would not permitthe evolution of credit card lending discussed in the commenter's exampleabove because unsecured lending by credit card or otherwise is clearlya different product or service from that of secured lending. Indeed, severalnonbank banks commenting on the proposal, whose activities would be directlyaffected by the proposal, stated in their comments that secured and unsecuredconsumer lending constitute distinct products for purposes of the cross-marketingrestriction.(b) <T3>Cross-Marketing ``Only in the Same Manner''</T3>. With respect to CEBA'slimitation that grandfathered products or services may be offered or marketed``only in the same manner,'' the proposed interpretation stated that themethod of offering or marketing the product or service must remain thesame. The interpretation illustrated this limitation by indicating thatan affiliate not using direct mailings as a marketing technique for theparticular product may not commence this activity after the grandfatherdate.Proponents of the rule state that the limitation on cross-marketing tothe same manner in which it was conducted on the grandfather date mustbe applied as written in order to minimize the potential for unfair competitiveadvantage. They contend that defining the term to include broad categoriesof marketing techniques would read the limitation out of the statute.Opponents of the rule, however, disagreed with the Board's approach. Somecommenters stated that it was inappropriate to consider the media or mediumused to cross-market in applying the limitations. Other commenters suggestedthat, in light of the constitutional protections accorded commercial freespeech, marketing methods should be broken down into broad categories,and if companies were using any market method within a particular categoryas of the grandfather date, then all of the methods in that category wouldbe available under the limitation. Although different categories were suggested,the most commonly suggested categories were: (a) mass media, (b) directmail or direct response marketing, and (c) personal or face-to-face solicitation.Some commenters favored even broader categories: (a) mass marketing and(b) direct marketing.As noted, the proposed interpretation did not define the term ``in thesame manner'' other than to indicate that the means of offering or marketingthe product or service must remain the same. Because a determination withrespect to a particular cross-marketing effort under this standard wouldnecessarily depend on the particular facts and circumstances in a givencase, the revised interpretation indicates that the scope of the restrictionwould be applied based on a case-by-case basis consistent with the guidingprinciples set out in the interpretation.3. <T3>Eligibility for Grandfathered Nonbank Bank Status</T3>: The proposedrule stated that institutions that had not commenced operations on August10, 1987, could not qualify for grandfather privileges under CEBA. Oneaffected company urged the Board to recognize grandfathered status if thecompany had received preliminary approval from its chartering authorityand had established a plan for operation. For the reasons stated in therule, the Board has decided to adopt the interpretation as proposed.4. <T3>Enforcement</T3>: The proposed rule noted that under section 4(f) ofCEBA, a company that controls a nonbank bank would lose its grandfatheredstatus if it or a subsidiary nonbank bank acquires control of an additionalbank or thrift, acquires more than 5 percent of voting shares of a bankor thrift (subject to certain exceptions), or violates the other CEBA limitations.Section 4(f)(4) of CEBA provides for the penalty of divestiture within180 days of the loss of grandfather exemptions through failure to complywith the CEBA limitations.Commenters argued that imposition of divestiture as the only sanction underthese circumstances was unwarranted under the Act and its legislative history.According to these comments, both of these sources indicate that the Boardhas a range of administrative enforcement options to deal with CEBA violations.Some commenters urged the Board to clarify that divestiture would be reservedonly for willful, material, recurring or wanton violations. Others requestedthe Board to apply this penalty only prospectively and provide prompt CEBAinterpretations to requesters.By its terms, the statute provides for loss of grandfather rights for violationsof the CEBA limitations, and, in this regard, the Conference Report statesthat nonbank banks that violate the overdrafts provisions of CEBA ``losetheir grandfathered status''. H.R. Rep. No. 100-261 at 127-128. The ConferenceReport, however, also indicates that the Conferees expected the Board touse its cease and desist or other supervisory authority as appropriate.<T3>Id</T3>. at 125.The Board has deleted reference to the divestiture provision of CEBA asBoard rules do not normally contain provisions relating to enforcement.The Board's responsibility under CEBA would be to enforce the statute andimplementing rules in each case, taking into account the terms of the statute,its legislative history, and the particular facts and circumstances ofthe case. Taking these factors into account, the Board would use its prosecutorialdiscretion to determine the appropriate enforcement action.The Board is prepared to provide prompt guidance in individual cases regardingthe scope or application of the CEBA limitations.5. <T3>Seven Percent Growth Rate Limitation</T3>: Under CEBA, a nonbank bank'sasset growth is limited to an annual rate of 7 percent during any 12-monthperiod beginning after August 10, 1988. Two principal issues are raisedby this provision: the method for determining the base against which the7 percent growth limit is to be applied during the initial 12-month periodand the period over which the calculation will be made. In its proposedrule, the Board noted that under CEBA, the 7 percent growth limitationwould not be applicable for one year following the date of enactment ofCEBA. Accordingly, the proposed rule indicated that nonbank banks could,at their option, choose to use the actual amount of assets reported ontheir books on August 10, 1988, as the initial base or the average totalassets reported on the call report for the quarter ending September 30,1988. The latter option was provided in order to eliminate the need foradditional reporting by permitting use of the quarterly report of conditionfor the bank.The proposed rule stated that the growth limit would be applied on a rollingtwelve-month basis, commencing initially on August 10, 1988, and thereafterat the start of each quarterly call report period (<T3>i</T3>.<T3>e</T3>. September 1, 1988, January 1, 1989, April 1, 1989, July 1,1989, and so on). The rule proposed further noted compliance would be determinedusing the institution's average assets over the 12-month period in accordancewith the directive in the CEBA Conference Report.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Conference Report states that the Board should ``indetermining compliance with the 7 percent growth rate, [to] utilize a procedurethat computes the grandfathered institution's growth rate on an averagebasis.'' H.R. Rep. No. 100-261 at 125.Under this approach, compliance with the 7 percent growth limit would bemeasured for the first 12-month period by comparing the average assetsfor the third quarter of 1989 as reported on Schedule RC-K of the Reportof Condition \1\\0\<NOTE/> with either the assets on August 10, 1988, or the averageassets for the third quarter of 1988, at the nonbank bank's option. Thereafter,growth would be measured by comparing the average assets for each quarterwith the average assets for the previous quarter.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Banking institutions with $100 million in assets ormore must file with their reports of condition their average assets overthe quarter calculated either on a daily basis or a weekly basis (<T3>i</T3>.<T3>e</T3>., an average of the Wednesday of each week of the quarter).Institutions with less than $100 million may report using an average ofthe four month-end figures.The alternate method of calculating the initial base figure by using theaverage assets for the third quarter of 1988 was not opposed, providedthe final rule would continue to permit a nonbank bank to use its actualassets on the bank's books on August 10, 1988. Commenters opposed to theproposed rule stated that the proposed rolling 12-month method of measuringcompliance was in conflict with the statutory language and the legislativeintent that growth be measured on an annual average basis. They also arguedthat this method of measuring compliance could lock then into quarterlybusiness patterns of growth and reduction that might be inconsistent withtheir normal growth patterns or cause them to make unsound business decisionssolely to comply with this needlessly restrictive method of measuring growth.This approach would also inhibit successful marketing compaigns and restrictopportunities in the market place.Finally, the comments from certain of the commenting nonbank banks urgedthe Board to avoid the ``use it or lose it'' result under the proposedrule's method of using each year's actual average annual assets as thebase for measuring the following year's growth. To avoid this result, theyproposed an annual asset cap that would be projected forward for each grandfatherednonbank bank from the bank's base figure, at 7 percent, compounded annually.Thus, an institution that failed to achieve a 7 percent growth rate inone year could make up for this in the following year by increasing itsgrowth rate by a corresponding amount above 7 percent. The comments in favor of the rule supported the Board's approach, indicatingthat the alternate approach advocated by the nonbank banks, which wouldallow growth in excess of 7 percent, would by its terms violate CEBA'slimitation on asset growth during any 12-month period to no more than 7percent.(a) <T3>Initial Base for Growth Limit. </T3>The revised rule retains both ofthe methods specified in the proposed rule for calculation of the initialbase.The Board has also provided a third option. A nonbank bank may, in itsdiscretion, elect to use at its initial base its total assets over thefour quarters ending September 30, 1988, as reported on Schedule RC-K ofits report of condition. This option would avoid the problem of havingto annualize growth during the first year and may be a desirable alternativefor nonbank banks that experienced even or no growth during the year afterAugust 10, 1987.A nonbank must advise the Board by October 15, 1988 of the method it haschosen to calculate its base figure for the initial 12-month complianceperiod. If the nonbank bank elects to use its actual assets on August 10,1988, as its initial base, in must report that figure to the Board by October15, 1988, along with its average assets for the third quarter of 1988 preparedin accordance with the rules in Schedule RC-K of the Report of Condition.While not required, a nonbank bank electing to use the August 10, 1988figure, may provide the Board with its assets at the end of the third quarteror any additional information it believes may be of assistance to the Boardin reviewing the August 10 figure in light of the concerns over ``windowdressing'' transactions discussed below.The revised rule addresses concerns raised that an institution could effect``window-dressing'' transactions on August 10, 1988, by engaging in extraordinaryshort-term transactions to inflate artificially its assets. The revisedrule notes that if the Board determines that a reporting nonbank bank'sassets have been inflated on August 10, 1988, without reference to thecustomary business activity of the institution, the Board would disallowthe window-dressing transactions or require that the initial date for thefirst 12-month period be adjusted to a date following August 10, 1988.The Board believes these rules are consistent with the terms of the statute\1\\1\<NOTE/> and the Board's authority to act to prevent evasions of theBHC Act. Comments from certain nonbank banks stated that such window-dressingtransactions could be disallowed in determining the initial base.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ The statute provides that the growth rate be appliedduring any 12-month period beginning after August 10, 1988. Thus, the Boardneed not start the first annual period on August 10, 1988, particularlywhere the record shows that the nonbank bank has manipulated its assetson the dated unrelated to its ligitimate business activities.(b) <T3>Frequency of Measurement of Growth Limit. </T3>After considering thepublic comments, the Board has decided to revise the rule to permit nonbankbanks to measure compliance with the growth limitation once a year at theend of the third quarter of each year. Thus, compliance with the growthrate would be determined for 12 month periods beginning on October 1 ofeach year and ending on September 30 of the following year. The initial12-month period would begin on October 1, 1988 and end of September 30,1989.After the first 12-month period, compliance for all nonbank banks willbe determined by measuring the average assets over the four quarters duringthe year (<T3>e.g., </T3>the fourth quarter of 1989 and the first three quartersof 1990) with the average assets for the proceeding four quarters (<T3>e.g., </T3>the fourth quarter 1988 and the first three quarters of1989). This approach would pose the least administrative burden while maintainingconsistency with the intent of the statute to limit the overall asset growthof nonbank banks. Moreover, this approach avoids locking the nonbank banksinto the same patterns of growth during the year.Compliance with the growth limit for the initial 12-month period commencingOctober 1, 1988, will be determined by comparing the average total assets(as reported on Schedule RC-K) for the four quarters ending with the thirdquarter of 1989 with the initial based figure chosen by the nonbank bank._<T3>Annualization Required for Initial 12-Month Period. </T3>Because thenonbank bank's average assets over the initial year will be compared toits average assets over the immediately preceding quarter, or its assetson a single day in that quarter (August 10, 1988), the simple rate of assetgrowth between these periods will differ from the annual rate of assetgrowth as limited by the statute.\12\<NOTE/> A 7 percent simple growth rate over this period would convertto an annual rate of growth of over 10 percent. For example, a nonbankbank with assets in the amount of $100 million on August 10, 1988, andwhich had average assets of $107 million over the four quarters endingwith the third quarter of 1989, would grow at a simple rate of 7 percent.At an annual rate, however, this growth would be 10.97 percent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Because compliance during all subsequent 12-month periodswill be determined by comparing comparable periods (<T3>i.e. </T3>average assets over a year to average assets over the precedingyear), no annualization is required for those periods.Adjusting the simple growth rate for this initial period is accomplishedby using a factor that converts a simple growth rate into an annual growthrate.\13\<NOTE/> This factor is calculated as the ratio of 365 days, the numberof days in a year, to the number of days between the midpoint of the baseperiod and the midpoint of the first compliance period, <T3>i.e., </T3>the four quarters ending with the third quarter of 1989.\14\<NOTE/> The ratio is therefore based on comparable measurements (<T3>i.e., </T3>the midpoint of the third quarter of 1988 with the midpointof the first 12-month period following the end of this quarter).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Calculating annual growth rates requires three piecesof information: the value of the item whose growth is being measured forthe initial or base period; the same information for the final period;and the length of time between these periods. The annual rate of growththen may be calculated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28">Where: G is the annual rate of growth, not compounded. F is the valueof the quantity whose growth is being measured as of the final period.I is the value of the quantity whose growth is being measured as of theinitial period.

The nonbank bank's average assets over the first 12-month periodcould not exceed its assets on August 10, 1988 by more than 7 percent dividedby this annualizing ratio. In the previous example, the simple growth ratepermissible during the initial period would be about 4.5 percent and assetscould average no more than $104.47 million over the first compliance periodunder this option.Nonbank banks selecting the average assets over the third quarter of 1988as the base figure for the initial 12-month period would apply an annualizingratio of 1.601 (365 days divided by 228 days from August 15, 1988 to March31, 1989). The nonbank bank's average assets over the first 12-month periodcould not exceed the average total assets for the third quarter of 1988by more than 7 percent divided by this annualizing ratio. In the previousexample, the simple growth rate permissible during the initial period wouldbe about 4.4 percent and assets could average no more than $104.37 millionover the first compliance period.Nonbank banks electing to use the average total assets for the four calendarquarters ending with the third quarter of 1988 as the initial base periodwould not be required to annualize because like-periods, one year apart,are being compared. As noted, annualization for all 12-month periods afterthe initial period (ending September 30, 1989) is also not necessary becauselike periods, one year apart, are being compared._<T3>Compliance on a Quarterly Basis. </T3>The Board has also decided topermit a nonbank bank, at its option, to measure compliance with the 7percent annual growth rate limitation under the rolling quarterly approachoriginally proposed. A nonbank bank deciding to elect this method mustadvise the Board of this decision by October 15, 1988.Finally, escrow deposit accounts are treated as deposits for purposes ofthe call report (<T3>see </T3>Schedule RC-E) and the Board does not believe it appropriateto exclude such deposits from the asset base. The Board is also constrainedby the terms of the statute from permitting a nonbank bank to grow at anannual rate greater than 7 percent during a 12-month period, because duringsome preceding period, the nonbank bank failed to achieve a 7 percent growthrate. Accordingly, the Board has decided not to adopt the view of certaincommenters that the Board should permit a nonbank bank to establish anasset cap based on 7 percent of the nonbank bank's assets on August 10,1988, projected forward.6. <T3>Overdrafts: </T3>The fourth limitation on nonbank banks prohibits anonbank bank from permitting an overdraft by an affiliate and from incurringan overdraft in its account with a Federal Reserve Bank on behalf of anaffiliate.CEBA states that a nonbank bank:<ITAG tagnum="20">shall not * * * after the date of the enactment of [CEBA], permitany overdraft (including an intraday overdraft), or incur any such overdraftin such bank's account at a Federal Reserve bank, on behalf of an affiliate,other than an overdraft [due to an inadvertent accounting or computer erroror a secured overdraft on behalf of an affiliate that is a primary dealer].12 U.S.C. 1843(f)(3)(B)(iii).</ITAG>The language of this statute clearly prohibits overdrafts by affiliateson the books of nonbank banks.\1\\5\<NOTE/> The statute also prohibits overdrafts by the nonbank bankin its account at its Federal Reserve Bank on behalf of an affiliate. Thelanguage ``on behalf of an affiliate'' is unclear. To read this languageto preclude only those overdrafts at a Federal Reserve Bank where the affiliatehas also overdrawn its account at the nonbank bank would render the languageunnecessary, because the overdraft by the affiliate is already specificallyprohibited. As the rules of statutory construction generally disfavor interpretationsthat render statutory language meaningless, it is appropriate to resortto extrinsic aids, such as the legislative history, in order to interpretthis language. The Conference Report to CEBA states: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ This overdraft prohibition does not prevent nonbankbanks from making loans to affiliates consistent with other laws, <T3>e.g., </T3>sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, applicablebank lending limits, and CEBA's restriction on new activities. A nonbankbank that was not making commercial loans prior to March 5, 1987, wouldviolate the new activity restrictions of CEBA by making loans to affiliatesafter that date. Where a debit is posted to an account, overdraws the account,and is not covered by a loan at that time, it is an overdraft.<ITAG tagnum="21">Overdrafts in an affiliate's accounts at a nonbank bank are difficultto police, particularly in times of financial difficulty of the affiliate,when the potential for overdrafts resulting in losses is highest. Accordingly,the overdraft restrictions provide that nonbank banks lose their grandfatheredstatus if they incur overdrafts at Federal Reserve banks. Federal Reservebanks are in a position to monitor such overdrafts on a real time basis.H.R. Rep. 100-261, pp. 127-128.</ITAG>This report indicates that Congress contemplated that the Federal Reservewould monitor overdrafts by the nonbank banks in their accounts at FederalReserve Banks, and that such an overdraft could result in the loss of thebank's grandfathered status.CEBA and its legislative history indicate that Congress was concerned aboutoverdrafts by nonbank banks' affiliates because of the risks they presentto uninsured depositors and creditors of the bank, as well as the FederalReserve and the FDIC, because a nonbank bank would be unable to make anindependent evaluation of the creditworthiness of an affiliate making paymentsthrough the nonbank bank.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Congress also restricted overdrafts by the nonbank bank inits account with the Reserve Bank even though the affiliate's account atthe nonbank bank had not been overdrawn. This latter restriction was included,in part, for ease of monitoring.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See, </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 100-261, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 127-128; commentsof Chairman Proxmire (floor manager), 133 Cong. Rec. S3801 (daily ed. March25, 1987).To implement the statutory language prohibiting overdrafts on behalf ofaffiliates by nonbank banks at Federal Reserve Banks, the proposed ruleprovided that an overdraft by a nonbank bank in the nonbank bank's accountat a Federal Reserve Bank would be deemed to be on bahalf of an affiliatewhenever: (1) a nonbank bank holds an account for an affiliate from whichthird party payments can be made; and (2) the aggregate balance of allof an affiliate's accounts with the nonbank bank is less, at the time thenonbank bank incurred an overdraft in its account at a Federal ReserveBank, than the aggregate balance of all of the affiliate's accounts maintainedby the nonbank bank at the opening of business on the day on which thenonbank bank incurred the overdraft.Thirty-five comments discussed this definition of when a nonbank bank overdraftat its Reserve Bank was ``on behalf of an affiliate''. Eight of the commentsstated that <T3>all </T3>overdrafts by a nonbank bank should be prohibited. Of theremaining twenty-seven comments, twenty-one were opposed to the definition,and six supported the definition.Those comments opposed to this section objected to the presumption thata drawdown by an affiliate at any time on the day a nonbank bank had anoverdraft caused the overdraft. They requested that a clearer causal connectionbe made. Although some comments suggested that the statute merely intendedto prohibit overdrafts by affiliates in their accounts with nonbank banks,this is clearly not the case because such interpretation would make thereference to overdrafts ``on behalf of an affiliate'' superfluous. To implementthis language, yet clarify the causal connection, the revised rule definesan overdraft ``on behalf of an affiliate'' to occur when the posting ofan affiliate's transaction to the nonbank bank's account at a Reserve Bankcreates or increases the nonbank bank's overdraft at its Reserve Bank.The affiliate would not necessarily have to overdraw an account with thenonbank bank for an overdraft at the Reserve Bank to be deemed to be onits behalf; rather, the transaction would have to put the nonbank bankinto an overdraft position at its Federal Reserve Bank or increase theamount of an already existing overdraft by a nonbank bank in its accountwith the Federal Reserve Bank.The Board recognizes that a decrease in an affiliate's account at its nonbankbank may cause a subsequent overdraft in the nonbank bank's account atits Federal Reserve Bank. Therefore, if a nonbank bank shows a consistentpattern of incurring overdrafts at its Federal Reserve Bank, after allowingan affiliate to draw down its account, the Board may view the pattern asevidence that the nonbank bank is evading the provisions of the Bank HoldingCompany Act.To facilitate administration of this rule, under the proposal, nonbankbanks were to be required to report to their Reserve Bank accounts heldfor affiliates from which third party payments could be made. All six commentsreceived on this section opposed it as too burdensome and unnecessary.By dropping the reporting requirement, the Board will have to monitor overdraftsof all nonbank banks, instead of just those with transaction accounts foraffiliate. Nevertheless, the Board believes that the overdraft restrictionscan be implemented without this requirement, and has deleted the reportingrequirement from the final regulation.In addition to the CEBA overdraft restrictions, the Board considered imposinga zero ``cap'' for purposes of the Board's general risk reduction programon all nonbank banks that offer to their affiliates accounts with thirdparty payment capabilities. Eighteen comments were received on this issue,and fourteen of those comments were opposed to it. Commenters objectedto this proposal as discriminatory and unjustified. The Board has thereforedetermined that the zero cap should not be imposed at this time, but thequestion may be studied further under the ongoing large dollar risk reductionprogram.Nevertheless, each Reserve Bank will pay particular attention to nonbankbanks when monitoring the depository institutions in its District, butno specific procedures have been adopted for monitoring nonbank banks.Any nonbank bank that becomes a ``problem'' institution (as defined bya Federal Reserve Bank) will be monitored most closely. _<T3>Posting. </T3>Posting is the procedure whereby the debit or creditadjustments resulting from payments transactions are made to the appropriateaccount. In order for nonbank banks to avoid overdrafts at Reserve Banks,they must know when entries will be posted to their accounts. Similarly,posting rules are necessary to determine whether an overdraft has occurredat a nonbank bank. Without posting rules, nonbank banks could evade thepurpose of the statute by posting entries at such times of the day as tomask overdrafts. Accordingly, the Board proposed posting rules for theaccounts of nonbank banks at Federal Reserve Banks and affiliates' accountsat nonbank banks. Sixteen comments discussed these proposed posting rules, with three infavor and 13 opposed. Those opposed considered them to be burdensome andunnecessary. The Board, however, believes that uniform posting rules arenecessary to ensure equal treatment of all nonbank banks and their affiliates,because the posting procedures currently in place are not uniform throughoutthe industry. These rules only apply for the purposes of measuring overdraftsunder CEBA and nonbank banks may continue to use other posting proceduresfor other purposes. These rules do not apply to depository institutionsthat are not nonbank banks covered by CEBA and are in addition to rulesapplicable to depository institutions' accounts at Federal Reserve Banksunder the Board's general risk reduction policy. This procedure differs from the posting rules used by the Board's ex postmonitoring system under the risk reduction program. Although the ex postmonitor method used in the risk reduction program is familiar to depositoryinstitutions, the Board believes that it is inappropriate to apply itsposting rules to nonbank banks for the purposes of applying the CEBA overdraftrestrictions. The ex post monitor posting rules were developed for a voluntaryprogram which does not involve the serious divestiture (or loss of exemption,in the case of industrial banks) consequences that can result from an overdraftunder CEBA. The Board is continuing to review the ex post monitor in lightof this and other issues, and the Board wishes to note that changes maybe made to the CEBA posting rules in conjunction with any future modificationof the ex post monitor posting rules. _<T3>Posting by Federal Reserve Banks. </T3>Reserve Banks will post fundsand book-entry securities transfers as they are made. For check, ACH, andnoncash transactions, net settlement entries, and nonelectronic transactions,all credits will be posted as of the opening of business and all debitsat the close of business.With regard to discount window loans, the Board proposed to post creditsfor discount window loans as of the close of business on the day the loanis made, and to post debits for repayment of loans as of the close of businessat the maturity of the loan. Commenters suggested that credit for discountwindow loans should be posted at the time of day the loan was actuallymade. In general, a discount window loan will be posted as of the closeof business. However, it is within a Federal Reserve Bank's discretionto grant a discount window loan that is requested during the day to coverintraday transactions. Therefore, under the final rule where it is expresslyagreed to by the Federal Reserve Bank at the time of the loan is made,a discount window loan may be posted prior to the close of business.In addition to the posting rules, Reserve Banks will pay particular attentionto depository transfer checks and ACH cash concentration debits used byaffiliates of nonbank banks. These transactions are likely to present risksthat are not addressed by the proposed posting rules. For example, wherean affiliate of a nonbank bank deposits depository transfer checks witha nonbank bank in order to transfer funds to its account at the nonbankbank from its account at another depository institution, it is likely thatthe check will be returned in the event of failure of the affiliate. Failureof the affiliate, in turn, may precipitate failure of the nonbank bank.The returned check will come to the Federal Reserve after the day whenthe credits for these transactions are posted to a nonbank bank's account,and therefore the risks presented by these returns are not addressed byposting rules. Consequently, where appropriate to protect against riskof return of these transactions, nonbank banks may be required to establisha special clearing balance at their Reserve Bank to be maintained at alltimes at a sufficient level to protect against these risks. _<T3>Posting by Grandfathered Banks. </T3>Because depository institutions'rights with respect to their customers differ from the rights that a ReserveBank has with respect to transactions that it processes, particularly inthe area of check and ACH transactions, the posting rules do not requirenonbank banks to post all transactions for CEBA monitoring purposes atthe same time that the transactions are posted by Reserve Banks. The regulationpermits nonbank banks to post checks and ACH transfers at any time duringthe day of the transaction_i.e., settlement day for ACH transactions orthe day of presentment or credit to the nonbank banks for check transactions_solong as debits are posted no later than the time that the nonbank bank'saccount at the Reserve Bank is debited for the transaction for purposesof CEBA overdraft monitoring, and credits are posted no earlier than thetime when the credit for the transaction is posted to the nonbank bank'saccount for purposes of CEBA overdraft monitoring. Some commenters opposed the posting provisions, stating that they wouldbe burdensome and unnecessary. One commenter suggested that any <T3>bona fide </T3>posting system should be acceptable unless it discriminatedagainst nonaffiliates. The Board, however, continues to believe that postingrules are necessary to ensure equal treatment of all nonbank banks andtheir affiliates, because the posting procedures currently in place arenot uniform throughout the industry. A modification to the regulation has been made to accomodate the provisionsof another title of CEBA_the Expedited Funds Availability Act_and statefunds availability laws. These laws require that, in certain cases, fundsfrom check deposits must be made available for withdrawal by the depositorprior to collection (posting). Therefore, in those situations where stateor federal law requires a nonbank bank to make funds available to its affiliateprior to the ``normal'' posting time for such check deposits set by theproposed regulation, the nonbank bank may post the transaction to its affiliate'saccount as of the time availability must be provided under the ExpeditedFunds Availability Act or state law.Another question raised by the comments was whether affiliates' accountsat a nonbank bank may be aggregated for determination of whether an affiliatehad incurred an overdraft at the nonbank bank. Aggregation of the accountsof separate affiliates is not permitted by the regulation, but a nonbankbank that has a legal right to offset one affiliate's account against anothercould post transactions that would overdraft an individual affiliate'saccount to another affiliate's account. A nonbank bank may aggregate theseparate accounts of an individual affiliate for the purpose of determiningwhether that affiliate has incurred an overdraft. Nonbank banks may keep two sets of books for posting: one for affiliatesfor CEBA purposes and another for other purposes. No posting to an affiliate'saccount is necessary for CEBA purpose if a nonbank bank returns a checkor an ACH debit transfer in accordance with applicable law. One concern of the commenters on the posting issue was the receipt of timelyaccount information from the Federal Reserve Bank. As set out more fullybelow, nonbank banks currently have access to sufficient information tomonitor their account balances. In addition, in mid-1989, the Federal ReserveBanks expect to offer a service allowing institutions to check their actualbalance in their reserve account on a real-time basis. _<T3>Exemptions.</T3> CEBA provides two exemptions from the restrictionon overdrafts. One exemption is for overdrafts on behalf of an affiliatethat is a primary dealer, where the overdraft is fully secured;\1\\7\<NOTE/> and the other exemption is for inadvertent computer or inadvertentaccounting errors that are beyond the control of both the grandfatherednonbank bank and the affiliate. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\This exemption does not apply to industrial banks. _<T3>Primary Dealers.</T3> CEBA defines a primary dealer as one that isrecognized as a primary dealer by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Currently, there are 42 such primary dealers, but only eight are affiliatedwith nonbank banks. Some of these eight primary dealers do not currentlyclear book-entry securities transfers through their nonbank banks. The overdraft prohibition in CEBA does not prohibit primary dealers fromincurring overdrafts at affiliated nonbank banks and the affiliated nonbankbanks from incurring overdrafts at their Federal Reserve Bank on behalfof the primary dealer affiliate, provided that these overdrafts are fullysecured, ``as required by the Board, by bonds, notes, or other obligationswhich are direct obligations of the United States or on which the principaland interest are fully guaranteed by the United States or by securitiesand obligations eligible for settlement on the Federal Reserve Book, entrysystem.''\1\\8\<NOTE/> The proposed regulation defined ``fully secured'' as securedby a perfected security interest in specific, identified obligations listedin the statute with a market value that, in the Reserve Bank's judgment,is sufficiently in excess of the amount of the overdraft to provide a marginof protection against a volatile market or the chance that the securitieswould need to be liquidated quickly. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\An overdraft is on behalf of a primary dealer affiliateonly to the extent that the primary dealer has drawn down its accounts;the overdraft does not include any drawdown or overdraft on the books ofthe nonbank bank by a nonaffiliate of the nonbank bank. Eleven comments were received on the Board's proposed implementation ofthe primary dealer exception. Only one comment supported the proposal.The remaining comments expressed concern about the discretion given tothe Reserve Bank to determine what constitutes ``fully secured''. In general,the commenters expressed the belief that any ``haircuts'' on collateralshould be set the same as for collateral posted by other depository institutions.The Board believes that generally haircuts should be based on the qualityof the collateral offered rather than the institution offering the collateral.Haircuts for discount window lending have historically been the provinceof the Federal Reserve Banks, and the Board believes that it is inappropriateto specify haircuts by regulation absent a compelling reason. Nevertheless,the Board believes that Federal Reserve Banks should be encouraged to adoptcomparable collateral valuation procedures for book entry securities fornonbank banks and other depository institutions. One primary dealer was particularly concerned about the interaction ofthe definition of overdrafts ``on behalf of an affiliate'' and the collateralizationrequirement for primary dealer overdrafts. This commenter believed thatdue to the drafting of the proposal, a primary dealer faced the possibilitythat nonaffiliate securities overdrafts would be deemed to be on its behalfand consequently requiring collateralization. The regulation has been revisedto clarify that it does not require collateralization of overdrafts bycustomers other than affiliates. The Board proposed establishing a cap or ceiling on the level of securities-relatedoverdrafts to be permitted by any one nonbank bank. Such a cap was to beset through self-evaluation procedures similar to those used in the riskreduction program, and nonbank banks exceeding the cap would be counseledor subject to other action by their Federal Reserve Bank, in accordancewith the Board's risk reduction policy. Only two comments were receivedon this question_one in favor and one opposed. After further consideration,the Board has determined that a cap should not be imposed in conjunctionwith the CEBA overdraft regulation. _<T3>Inadvertent Errors.</T3> CEBA also exempts from the overdraft restrictionsthose overdrafts resulting from inadvertent computer or inadvertent accountingerrors that are beyond the control of both the nonbank bank and the affiliate.An inadvertent accounting error is an error involving the recordation ofentries to an account of a nonbank bank or affiliate resulting in an overdraftthat was not reasonably foreseeable or preventable by the nonbank bankor the affiliate. A misposting of an entry by a Reserve Bank would notresult in an overdraft in a nonbank bank's account because no extensionof credit had been made. Similarly, a misposting of an entry by a nonbankbank to an affiliate's account would not result in an overdraft. An inadvertent computer error is an error resulting from a computer malfunctionor from computer processing of adjustments in an account that results inan overdraft that was not reasonably foreseeable or preventable. Such errorswould include problems where a nonbank bank or affiliate could not avoidbook-entry securities overdrafts from inbound securities transfers, becauseit could not originate off-setting outbound transfers of securities orwhere a nonbank bank received a book-entry securities transaction sentto it in error. On the other hand, if a Federal Reserve Bank's computershould go down so as to prevent a Fedwire funds transfer from being sentto the nonbank bank, any overdraft due to outband Fedwire funds transferswould be within the control of the nonbank bank, because the nonbank bankcould have waited until it had sufficient funds in its account to coverthe outbound transfer.Sixteen commenters argued that this definition of inadvertent error shouldbe broadened to include overdrafts where the nonbank bank executes a transactionon behalf of an affiliate that results in a debit to its account, and incursan overdraft because an anticipated transaction that would have createdan offsetting credit to its account is delayed because of Federal ReserveBank computer problems. The Board believes that it would be inappropriateto broaden the definitions of inadvertent error to this extent. Nonbankbanks should be responsible for controlling their own accounts. Althoughsome nonbank bank commenters argued that they had a responsibility to makesome transfers to prevent the customer's default on an obligation, customeraccount agreements between banks and their customers generally permit banksto delay customer transactions where necessary.The posting rules and the Federal Reserve's advice services enable a nonbankbank to monitor its account balance. Under the posting rules, generallythe only debits that are posted intraday result from funds and securitiestransfers. Credits for other transactions are posted in the morning anddebits at the end of the day. A nonbank bank can get its opening balanceeach day from its Federal Reserve Bank at the time Fedwire opens for businessin its district. The nonbank bank will know the amount of any ACH creditsfor which it has previously received advices, all its cash letters sentfor collection, and the amount of any ACH debits that it originated andcan add these credits to its opening balance. A Federal Reserve bank givesan automatic advice to on-line institutions of each funds or securitiestransfer when it is posted to the reserve account. Those institutions thatare not on-line can have a standing request for a telephone advice foreach such transfer. Therefore, the nonbank bank can adjust its balancethroughout the day to reflect funds and securities transfers. And whenthe cash letter and ACH tape are presented to the nonbank bank, it canmake the debit adjustments to its account as of the close of business.Thus, the nonbank bank should be able to closely monitor its balance withthe Federal Reserve Bank according to the regulation's posting rules.Finally, if the inadvertent error provision is expanded to cover FederalReserve Bank computer outages, it would be difficult to justify not expandingit to cover outages at other banks. Staff believes that such a definitionwould lead to extremely complex inquiries into individual overdrafts andshould be rejected. Nevertheless, staff recommends that the definitionof an inadvertent error be expanded to include overdrafts due to the receiptof book entry securities transfers that are promptly returned as erroneoustransfers.7. <T3>Definition of Bank: </T3>The proposed rules amended the definitionof bank in Regulation Y to reflect the changes to the bank definition inthe BHC Act made by CEBA. They also added the definition of ``affiliate''from CEBA and a definition of nonbank bank. The Board received no commenton the bank and affiliate definitions and is adopting them as proposed.The Board is adopting the nonbank bank definition to describe those institutionsthat were covered by the CEBA amendments.<T3>Conclusion: </T3>Except for the limitation on overdrafts (andSection;225.52) which is effective in 90 days, these amendments to Regulation Yare effective immediately. The amendments to section 225.2 merely set forththe definition of ``bank'', ``nonbank bank'', and ``affiliate'' that areprovided in CEBA. The new section 225.51 defines the limitation on theasset growth of nonbank banks established by CEBA.The Board finds good cause to make these amendments effective immediately.The amendments to the section on definitions conform the regulation tothe change in the statute. As a result of the enactment of CEBA, thesedefinitions are already effective. The addition of section 225.51 is effectiveimmediately because CEBA requires that grandfathered nonbank banks limittheir annual asset growth for 12-month periods after August 10, 1988. Thisnew section sets forth the means by which the Board will measure this growth.Because the statutory annual growth rate requirement is already in effect,the Board finds that there is good cause to make the regulation implementingthat requirement effective immediately to allow nonbank banks to plan theirbusiness activities so as to conform to the method the Board will use tomeasure compliance with the limitation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Notice</ITAG>The Board finds good cause for instituting a new collection of informationwithout providing an opportunity for public comment. The new collectionof information is a one-time occurrence. To comply with the statutory requirementsof CEBA, nonbank banks must report the base asset figure against whichthe 7 percent limitation on growth will be measured. The rules providethat the nonbank banks with three options for determining their initialbase figure. The nonbank bank must advise the Board by October 15, 1988of the method elected. Should a nonbank bank elect to use the August 10,1988 base date, it must file a report of that asset figure by October 15,1988, along with its average assets for the third quarter of 1988. (Shoulda nonbank bank elect to use the third calendar quarter 1988 data or theaverage assets for the four quarters ending September 30, 1988, the informationis already collected in Schedule RC-K of its Report of Condition.)A nonbank bank electing to measure compliance with the growth rate on arolling quarterly basis as permitted by the Board's rules, must reportthat election to the Board also by October 15, 1988.The new collection of information must be instituted quickly and publicparticipation in the approval process would substantially interfere withthe Board's ability to perform its statutory obligation of enforcing the7 percent growth limitation set forth in CEBA.The information to be collected from nonbank banks is contained in a newinformation collection, the ``Report by Nonbank Banks of Total Assets onAugust 10, 1988'' (form FR 3050; OMB No. 7100-0236). This information collectionconsists of a free-form voluntary report of the method chosen by the nonbankbanks to calculate their initial base figure and the total assets of theseinstitutions on August 10, 1988, if this method for calculating the annualbase is elected along with the institution's average assets for the thirdquarter of 1988. This report was approved by the Board under delegatedauthority from the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') at the sametime the Board approved this final rule. The Board estimates that the disclosurerequirement will result in a one-time reporting burden of 28 hours.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>Of the items required to be obtained in a final regulatory flexibilityanalysis by 5 U.S.C. andSection; 604(a), the first (a statement of the needfor and objectives of the rule) and the second (a summary of the issuesraised by the commenters, the Board's assessment of the issues, and thechanges made to the proposed rule in response to the comments) are containedelsewhere in this preamble.The third item required for a final regulatory flexibility analysis isa description of the significant alternatives to the rule consistent withthe objectives of applicable statutes and designed to minimize any significanteconomic effect of the rule on small entities considered by the Board,and why these were rejected.The Board proposed that all requirements of the amended rules be applicableto all nonbank banks and industrial banks subject to the rules regardlessof size. The small entities most likely to be affected by this rulemakingare the industrial banks that are subject to the limitations on overdrafts.No comments were received requesting exemption of industrial banks dueto their small size. According to Board records on overdrafts under thecurrent risk reduction policy, very few industrial banks reporting to theBoard have incurred overdraft since the enactment of CEBA. Thus, it doesnot appear that a substantial number of industrial banks will be affectedby the rule.No comments were received stating that the new rules impose burdens specificallyon small banks. Some comments stated that certain requirements, such asthe posting rules, were burdensome and should not be required, but rather,that the Board should accept any <T3>bona fide </T3>posting system that did not discriminate against nonaffiliateddepositors. As stated elsewhere in this preamble, the Board consideredthis comment but determined that uniform posting rules are necessary toensure equal treatment of all industrial banks, nonbank banks and theiraffiliates, because the posting procedures currently in place are not standardizedthroughout the industry.Other than the overdraft rules for which the posting rules were set, thelimitations established by these rules apply only to nonbank banks. Thereare approximately 55 of these institutions, and less than half are smallentities. The Board considered exempting small banks from the rule's requirements,but CEBA does not provide an exempiton according to the size of the nonbankbank.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 225</ITAG>Banks, banking, Federal Reserve System, Holding companies, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements, Securities.For the reasons set out in this notice, and pursuant to the Board's authorityunder section 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1844),the Board amends 12 CFR Part 225 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 225_BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL</ITAG>1.

Section 225.145 is added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 225.145</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Limitations established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of1987 on the activities and growth of nonbank banks.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Introduction.</T3> Effective August 10, 1987, the Competitive EqualityBanking Act of 1987 (``CEBA'') redefined the term ``bank'' in the BankHolding Company Act (``BHC Act'' or ``Act'') to include any bank the depositsof which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as wellas any other institution that accepts demand or checkable deposit accountsand is engaged in the business of making commercial loans. 12 U.S.C. 1841(c).CEBA also contained a grandfather provision for certain companies affectedby this redefinition. CEBA amended section 4 of the BHC Act to permit acompany that on March 5, 1987, controlled a nonbank bank (an institutionthat became a bank as a result of enactment of CEBA) and that was not abank holding company on August 9, 1987, to retain its nonbank bank andnot be treated as a bank holding company for purposes of the BHC Act ifthe company and its subsidiary nonbank bank observe certain limitationsimposed by CEBA.\1\<NOTE/> Certain of these limitations are codified in section 4(f)(3)of the BHC Act and generally restrict nonbank banks from commencing newactivities or certain cross-marketing activities with affiliates afterMarch 5, 1987, increasing their assets at an annual rate exceeding 7 percentduring any 12 month period after August 10, 1988, or permitting overdraftsfor affiliates or incurring overdrafts on behalf of affiliates at a FederalReserve Bank. 12 U.S.C. 1843(f)(3).\2\<NOTE/> The Board's views regarding the meaning and scope of theselimitations are set forth below and in provisions of the Board's RegulationY (12 CFR 225.51 and 52).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 12 U.S.C. 1843(f). Such a company is treated as a bankholding company, however, for purposes of the anti-tying provisions insection 106 of the BHC Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1971 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and the insider lending limitations of secton 22(h) ofthe Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 375b). The company is also subject tocertain examination and enforcement provisions to assure compliance withCEBA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ CEBA also prohibits, with certain limited exceptions,a company controlling a grandfathered nonbank bank from acquiring controlof an additional bank or thrift institution or acquiring, directly or indirectlyafter March 5, 1987, more than 5 percent of the assets or shares of a bankor thrift institution. 12 U.S.C. 1843(f)(2).(b) <T3>Congressional findings.</T3> (1) At the outset, the Board notes thatthe scope and application of the Act's limitations on nonbank banks mustbe guided by the Congressional findings set out in section 4(f)(3) of theBHC Act. Congress was aware that these nonbank banks had been acquiredby companies that engage in a wide range of nonbanking activities, suchas retailing and general securities activities that are forbidden to bankholding companies under section 4 of the BHC Act. In section 4(f)(3), Congressfound that nonbank banks controlled by grandfathered nonbanking companiesmay, because of their relationships with affiliates, be involved in conflictsof interest, concentration of resources, or other effects adverse to banksafety and soundness. Congress also found that nonbank banks may be ableto compete unfairly against banks controlled by bank holding companiesby combining banking services with financial services not permissible forbank holding companies. Section 4(f)(3) states that the purpose of thenonbank bank limitations is to minimize any such potential adverse effectsor inequities by restricting the activities of nonbank banks until furtherCongressional action in the area of bank powers could be undertaken. Similarly,the Senate Report accompanying CEBA states that the restrictions CEBA placeson nonbank banks ``will help prevent existing nonbank banks from changingtheir basic character * * * while Congress considers proposals for comprehensivelegislation; from drastically eroding the separation of banking and commerce;and from increasing the potential for unfair competition, conflicts ofinterest, undue concentration of resources, and other adverse effects.''S. Rep. No. 100-19, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1987). <T3>See also</T3> H. Rep. No. 100-261, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 124 (1987)(the ``Conference Report'').(2) Thus, Congress explicitly recognized in the statute itself that nonbankingcompanies controlling grandfathered nonbank banks, which include the manyof the nation's largest commercial and financial organizations, were beingaccorded a significant competitive advantage that could not be matchedby bank holding companies because of the general prohibition against nonbankingactivities in section 4 of the BHC Act. Congress recognized that this inequalityin regulatory approach could inflict serious competitive harm on regulatedbank holding companies as the grandfathered entities sought to exploitpotential synergies between banking and commercial products and services.<T3>See</T3> Conference Report at 125-126. The basic and stated purposeof the restrictions on grandfathered nonbank banks is to minimize thesepotential anticompetitive effects.(3) The Board believes that the specific CEBA limitations should be implementedin light of these Congressional findings and the legislative intent reflectedin the plain meaning of the terms used in the statute. In those instanceswhen the language of the statute did not provide clear guidance, legislativematerials and the Congressional intent manifested in the overall statutorystructure were considered. The Board also notes that prior precedent requiresthat grandfather exceptions in the BHC Act, such as the nonbank bank limitationsand particularly the exceptions thereto, are to be interpreted narrowlyin order to ensure the proper implementation of Congressional intent.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>E.g., Maryland National Corporation,</T3> 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin310, 313-314 (1987). <T3>Cf., Spokane andamp; Inland Empire Railroad Co.</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> 241 U.S. 344, 350 (1915).(c) <T3>Activity limitation.</T3>_(1) <T3>Scope of ``activity''.</T3> (i) The first limitation established undersection 4(f)(3) provides that a nonbank bank shall not ``engage in anyactivity in which such bank was not lawfully engaged as of March 5, 1987.''The term ``activity'' as used in this provision of CEBA is not defined.The structure and placement of the CEBA activity restriction within section4 of the BHC Act and its legislative history do, however, provide directionas to certain transactions that Congress intended to treat as separateactivities, thereby providing guidance as to the meaning Congress intendedto ascribe to the term generally. First, it is clear that the term ``activity''was not meant to refer to banking as a single activity. To the contrary,the term must be viewed as distinguishing between deposit taking and lendingactivities and treating demand deposit-taking as a separate activity fromgeneral deposit-taking and commercial lending as separate from the generallending category.(ii) Under the activity limitation, a nonbank bank may engage only in activitiesin which it was ``lawfully engaged'' as of March 5, 1987. As of that date,a nonbank bank could not have been engaged in both demand deposit-takingand commercial lending activity without placing it and its parent holdingcompany in violation of the BHC Act. Thus, under the activity limitations,a nonbank bank could not after March 5, 1987, commence the demand deposit-takingor commercial lending activity that it did not conduct as of March 5, 1987.The debates and Senate and Conference Reports on CEBA confirm that Congressintended the activity limitation to prevent a grandfathered nonbank bankfrom converting itself into a full-service bank by both offering demanddeposits and engaging in the business of making commercial loans.\4\<NOTE/> Thus, these types of transactions provide a clear guide asto the type of banking transactions that would constitute activities underCEBA and the degree of specificity intended by Congress in interpretingthat term.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Conference Report at 124-25; S. Rep. No. 100-19 at 12,32; H. Rep. No. 99-175, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1985) (``the activitieslimitation is to prevent an institution engaged in a limited range of functionsfrom expanding into new areas and becoming, in essence, a full-servicebank''); 133 Cong. Rec. S4054 (daily ed. March 27, 1987); (Comments ofSenator Proxmire).(iii) It is also clear that the activity limitation was not intended simplyto prevent a nonbank bank from both accepting demand deposits and makingcommercial loans; it has a broader scope and purpose. If Congress had meantthe term to refer to just these two activities, it would have used therestriction it used in another section of CEBA dealing with nonbank banksowned by bank holding companies which has this result, <T3>i.e., </T3>the nonbank bank could not engage in any activity that wouldhave caused it to become a bank under the prior bank definition in theAct. <T3>See </T3>12 U.S.C. 1843(g)(1)(A). Indeed, an earlier version of CEBAunder consideration by the Senate Banking Committee contained such a provisionfor nonbank banks owned by commercial holding companies, which was deletedin favor of the broader activity limitation actually enacted. CommitteePrint No. 1, (Feb. 17, 1987). In this regard, both the Senate Report andConference Report refer to demand deposit-taking and commercial lendingas examples of activities that could be affected by the activity limitation,not as the sole activities to be limited by the provision.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Conference Report at 124-125; S. Rep. No. 100-19 at 32.(iv) Finally, additional guidance as to the meaning of the term ``activity''is provided by the statutory context in which the term appears. The activitylimitation is contained in section 4 of the BHC Act, which regulates theinvestments and activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanksubsidiaries. The Board believes it reasonable to conclude that by placingthe CEBA activity limitation in section 4 of the BHC Act, Congress meantthat Board and judicial decisions regarding the meaning of the term ``activity''in that section be looked to for guidance. This is particularly appropriategiven the fact that grandfathered nonbank banks, whether owned by bankholding companies or unregulated holding companies, were treated as nonbankcompanies and not banks before enactment of CEBA.(v) This interpretation of the term activity draws support from commentsby Senator Proxmire during the Senate's consideration of the provisionthat the term was not intended to apply ``on a product-by-product, customer-by-customerbasis.'' 133 Cong. Rec. S4054-5 (daily ed. March 27, 1987). This is thesame manner in which the Board has interpreted the term activity in thenonbanking provision of section 4 as referring to generic categories ofactivities, not to discrete products and services.(vi) Accordingly, consistent with the terms and purposes of the legislationand the Congressional intent to minimize unfair competition and the otheradverse effects set out in the CEBA findings, the Board concludes thatthe term ``activity'' as used in section 4(f)(3) means any line of bankingor nonbanking business. This definition does not, however, envision a product-by-productapproach to the activity limitation. The Board believes it would be helpfulto describe the application of the activity limitation in the context ofthe following major categories of activities: deposit-taking, lending,trust, and other activities engaged in by banks.(2) <T3>Deposit-taking activities.</T3> (i) With respect to deposit-taking,the Board believes that the activity limitation in section 4(f)(3) generallyrefers to three types of activity: demand deposit-taking; non-demand deposit-takingwith a third party payment capability; and time and savings deposit-takingwithout third party payment powers. As previously discussed, it is clearfrom the terms and intent of CEBA that the activity limitation would prevent,and was designed to prevent, nonbank banks that prior to the enactmentof CEBA had refrained from accepting demand deposits in order to avoidcoverage as a ``bank'' under the BHC Act, from starting to take these depositsafter enactment of CEBA and thus becoming full-service banks. Accordingly,CEBA requires that the taking of demand deposits be treated as a separateactivity.(ii) The Board also considers nondemand deposits withdrawable by checkor other similar means for payment to third parties or others to constitutea separate line of business for purposes of applying the activity limitation.In this regard, the Board has previously recognized that this line of businesssconstitutes a permissible but separate activity under section 4 of theBHC Act. Furthermore, the offering of accounts with transaction capabilityrequires different expertise and systems than non-transaction deposit-takingand represented a distinct new activity that traditionally separated banksfrom thrift and similar institutions.(iii) Support for this view may also be found in the House Banking Committeereport on proposed legislation prior to CEBA that contained a similar prohibitionon new activities for nonbank banks. In discussing the activity limitation,the report recognized a distinction between demand deposits and accountswith transaction capability and those without transaction capability:<ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to deposits, the Committee recognizes that it is legitimatefor an institution currently involved in offering demand deposits or otherthird party transaction accounts to make use of new technologies that arein the process of replacing the existing check-based, paper payment system.Again, however, the Committee does not believe that technology should beused as a lever for an institution that was only incidentally involvedin the payment system to transform itself into a significant offeror oftransaction account capability.\6\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ H. Rep. No. 99-175, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1985). (iv) Finally, this distinction between demand and nondemand checkable accountsand accounts not subject to withdrawal by check was specifically recognizedby Congress in the redefinition of the term ``bank'' in CEBA to includean institution that takes demand deposits or ``deposits that the depositormay withdraw by check or other means for payment to third parties or others''as well as in various exemptions from that definition for trust companies,credit card banks, and certain industrial banks.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ See 12 U.S.C. 1841(c)(2) (D), (F), (H), and (I).(v) Thus, an institution that as of March 5, 1987, offered only time andsavings accounts that were not withdrawable by check for payment to thirdparties could not thereafter begin offering accounts with transaction capability,for example, NOW accounts or other types of transaction accounts. (3) <T3>Lending. </T3>As noted, the CEBA activity limitation does not treatlending as a single activity; it clearly distinguishes between commercialand other types of lending. This distinction is also reflected in the definitionof ``bank'' in the BHC Act in effect both prior to and after enactmentof CEBA as well as in various of the exceptions from this definition. Inaddition, commercial lending is a specialized form of lending involvingdifferent techniques and analysis from other types of lending. Based uponthese factors, the Board would view commercial lending as a separate anddistinct activity for purposes of the activity limitation in section 4(f)(3).The Board's decisions under section 4 of the BHC Act have not generallydifferentiated between types of commercial lending, and thus the Boardwould view commercial lending as a single activity for purposes of CEBA.Thus, a nonbank bank that made commercial loans as of March 5, 1987, couldmake any type of commercial loan thereafter. (i) <T3>Commercial lending. </T3>For purposes of the activity limitation, acommercial loan is defined in accordance with the Supreme Court's decisionin <T3>Board of Governors </T3>v. <T3>Dimension Financial Corporation, </T3>474 U.S. 361 (1986), as a directloan to a business customer for the purpose of providing funds for thatcustomer's business. In this regard, the Board notes that whether a particulartransaction is a commercial loan must be determined not from the face ofthe instrument, but from the application of the definition of commercialloan in the <T3>Dimension</T3> decision to that transaction. Thus, certain transactionsof the type mentioned in the Board's ruling at issue in <T3>Dimension</T3> and in the Senate and Conference Reports in the CEBAlegislation \8\<NOTE/> would be commercial loans if they meet the test for commercialloans established in <T3>Dimension. </T3>Under this test, a commercial loan would not include,for example, an open-market investment in a commercial entity that doesnot involve a borrower-lender relationship or negotiation of credit terms,such as a money market transaction. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ S. Rep. No. 100-19 at 31; Conference Report at 123. (ii) <T3>Other lending. </T3>Based upon the guidance in the Act as to the degreeof specificity required in applying the activity limitation with respectto lending, the Board believes that, in addition to commercial lending,there are three other types of lending activities: consumer mortgage lending,consumer credit card lending, and other consumer lending. Mortgage lendingand credit card lending are recognized, discrete lines of banking and businessactivity, involving techniques and processes that are different from andmore specialized than those required for general consumer lending. Forexample, these activities are, in many cases, conducted by specializedinstitutions, such as mortgage companies and credit card institutions,or through separate organizational structures within an institution, particularlyin the case of mortgage lending. Additionally, the Board's decisions undersection 4 of the Act have recognized mortgage banking and credit card lendingas separate activities for bank holding companies. The Board's RegulationY reflects this specialization, noting as examples of permissible lendingactivity: consumer finance, credit card and mortgage lending. 12 CFR 225.25(b)(1).Finally, CEBA itself recognizes the specialized nature of credit card lendingby exempting an institution specializing in that activity from the bankdefinition. For purpose of the activity limitation, a consumer mortgageloan will mean any loan to an individual that is secured by real estateand that is not a commercial loan. A credit card loan would be any loanmade to an individual by means of a credit card that is not a commercialloan. (4) <T3>Trust activities. </T3>Under section 4 of the Act, the Board has historicallytreated trust activities as a single activity and has not differentiatedthe function on the basis of whether the customer was an individual ora business. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 225.25(b)(3). Similarly, the trust company exemptionfrom the bank definition in CEBA makes no distinction between various typesof trust activities. Accordingly, the Board would view trust activitiesas a separate activity without additional differentiation for purposesof the activity limitation in section 4(f)(3). (5) <T3>Other activities. </T3>With respect to activities other than the varioustraditional deposit-taking, lending or trust activities, the Board believesit appropriate, for the reasons discussed above, to apply the activitylimitation in section 4(f)(3) as the term ``activity'' generally appliesin other provisions of section 4 of the BHC Act. Thus, a grandfatherednonbank bank could not, for example, commence after March 5, 1987, anyof the following activities (unless it was engaged in such an activityas of that date): discount securities brokerage, full-service securitiesbrokerage investment advisory services, underwriting or dealing in governmentsecurities as permissible for member banks, foreign exchange transactionservices, real or personal property leasing, courier services, data processingfor third parties, insurance agency activities,\9\<NOTE/> real estate development, real estate brokerage, real estatesyndication, insurance underwriting, management consulting, futures commissionmerchant, or activities of the general type listed in andSection; 225.25(b)of Regulation Y.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ In this area, section 4 of the Act does not treat allinsurance agency activities as a single activity. Thus, for example, theAct treats the sale of credit-related life, accident and health insuranceas a separate activity from general insurance agency activities. See 12U.S.C. 1843(c)(8).(6) <T3>Meaning of ``engaged in''. </T3>In order to be ``engaged in'' an activity,a nonbank bank must demonstrate that it had a program in place to providea particular product or service included within the grandfathered activityto a customer and that it was in fact offering the product or service tocustomers as of March 5, 1987. Thus, a nonbank bank is not engaged in anactivity as of March 5, 1987, if the product or service in question wasin a planning state as of that date and had not been offered or deliveredto a customer. Consistent with prior Board interpretations of the termactivity in the grandfather provisions of section 4, the Board does notbelieve that a company may be engaged in an activity on the basis of asingle isolated transaction that was not part of a program to offer theparticular product or to conduct in the activity on an ongoing basis. Forexample, a nonbank bank that held an interest in a single real estate projectwould not thereby be engaged in real estate development for purposes ofthis provision, unless evidence was presented indicating the interest washeld under a program to commence a real estate development business.(7) <T3>Meaning of ``as of''. </T3>The Board believes that the grandfatherdate ``as of March 5, 1987'' as used throughout section 4(f)(3) shouldrefer to activities engaged in on March 5, 1987, or a reasonably shortperiod preceding this date not exceeding 13 months. 133 Cong. Rec. S3957(daily ed. March 26, 1987). (Remarks of Senators Dodd and Proxmire). Activitiesthat the institution had terminated prior to March 5, 1988, however, wouldnot be considered to have been conducted or engaged in ``as of'' March5. For example, if within 13 months of March 5, 1987, the nonbank bankhad terminated its commercial lending activity in order to avoid the ``bank''definition in the Act, the nonbank bank could not recommence that activityafter enactment of CEBA.(d) <T3>Cross-marketing limitation._</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Section 4(f)(3) also limits cross-marketing activitiesby nonbank banks and their affiliates. Under this provision, a nonbankbank may not offer or market a product or service of an affiliate unlessthe product or service may be offered by bank holding companies generallyunder section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. In addition, a nonbank bank may notpermit any of its products or services to be offered or marketed by orthrough a nonbank affiliate unless the affiliate engages only in activitiespermissible for a bank holding company under section 4(c)(8). These limitationsare subject to an exception for products or services that were being sooffered or marketed as of March 5, 1987, but only in the same manner inwhich they were being offered or marketed as of that date.(2) <T3>Examples of impermissible cross-marketing. </T3>The Conference Reportillustrates the application of this limitation to the following two coveredtransactions: (i) products and services of an affiliate that bank holdingcompanies may not offer under the BHC Act, and (ii) products and servicesof the nonbank bank. In the first case, the restrictions would prohibit,for example, a company from marketing life insurance or automotive suppliesthrough its affiliate nonbank bank because these products are not generallypermissible under the BHC Act. Conference Report at 126. In the secondcase, a nonbank bank may not permit its products or services to be offeredor marketed through a life insurance affiliate or automobile parts retailerbecause these affiliates engage in activities prohibited under the BHCAct. <T3>Id.</T3>(3) <T3>Permissible cross-marketing. </T3>On the other hand, a nonbank bankcould offer to its customers consumer loans from an affiliated mortgagebanking or consumer finance company. These affiliates could likewise offertheir customers the nonbank bank's products or services provided the affiliatesengaged only in activities permitted for bank holding companies under theclosely-related-to-banking standard of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act.If the affiliate is engaged in both permissible and impermissible activitieswithin the meaning of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act, however, the affiliatecould not offer or market the nonbank bank's products or services.(4) <T3>Product approach to cross-marketing restriction. </T3>(i) Unlike theactivity restrictions, the cross-marketing restrictions of CEBA apply bytheir terms to individual products and services. Thus, an affiliate ofa nonbank bank that was engaged in activities that are not permissiblefor bank holding companies and that was marketing a particular productor service of a nonbank bank on the grandfather date could continue tomarket that product and, as discussed below, could change the terms andconditions of the loan. The nonbank affiliate could not, however, beginto offer or market another product or service of the nonbank bank.(ii) The Board believes that the term ``product or service'' must be interpretedin light of its accepted ordinary commercial usage. In some instances,commercial usage has identified a group of products so closely relatedthat they constitute a product line (<T3>e.g., </T3>certificates of deposit) and differences in versions ofthe product (<T3>e.g., </T3>a one-year certificate of deposit) simply represent a differencein the terms of the product.\10\<NOTE/> This approach is consistent with the treatment in CEBA'slegislative history of certificates of deposit as a product line ratherthan each particular type of CD as a separate product.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ American Bankers Association, <T3>Banking Terminology </T3>(1981).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ During the Senate debates on CEBA, Senator Proxmire inresponse to a statement from Senator Cranston that the joint-marketingrestrictions do not lock into place the specific terms or conditions ofthe particular grandfathered product or service, stated:<ITAG tagnum="28">That is correct. For example, if a nonbank bank was jointly marketingon March 5, 1987, a 3 year, $5,000 certificate of deposit, this bill wouldnot prohibit offering in the same manner a 1 year, $2,000 certificate ofdeposit with a different interest rate. 133 Cong. Rec. S3959 (daily ed.March 26, 1987).</ITAG>(iii) In the area of consumer lending, the Board believes the followingprovide examples of different consumer loan products: mortgage loans tofinance the purchase of the borrower's residence, unsecured consumer loans,consumer installment loans secured by the personal property to be purchased(<T3>e.g. </T3>automobile, boat or home appliance loans), or second mortgageloans.\1\\2\<NOTE/> Under this interpretation, a nonbank bank that offered automobileloans through a nonbank affiliate on the grandfather date could marketboat loans, appliance loans or any type of secured consumer installmentloan through that affiliate. It could not, however, market unsecured consumerloans, home mortgage loans or other types of consumer loans.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ In this regard, the Supreme Court in <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Philadelphia National Bank, </T3>noted that ``the principal bankingproducts are of course various types of credit, for example: unsecuredpersonal and business loans, mortgage loans, loans secured by securitiesor accounts receivable, automobile installment and consumer goods, installmentloans, tuition financing, bank credit cards, revolving credit funds.''374 U.S. 321, 326 n.5 (1963).(iv) In other areas, the Board believes that the determination as to whatconstitutes a product or service should be made on a case-by-case basisconsistent with the principles that the terms ``product or service'' mustbe interpreted in accordance with their ordinary commercial usage and mustbe narrower in scope than the definition of activity. Essentially, theconcept applied in this analysis is one of permitting the continuationof the specific product marketing activity that was undertaken as of March5, 1987. Thus, for example, while insurance underwriting may constitutea separate activity under CEBA, a nonbank bank could not market a lifeinsurance policy issued by the affiliate if on the grandfather date ithad only marketed homeowners' policies issued by the affiliate.(5) <T3>Change in terms and conditions permitted. </T3>(i) The cross-marketingrestrictions would not limit the ability of the institution to change thespecific terms and conditions of a particular grandfathered product orservice. The Conference Report indicates a legislative intent not to lockinto place the specific terms or conditions of a grandfathered productor service. Conference Report at 126. For example, a nonbank bank marketinga three-year, $5,000 certificate of deposit through an affiliate underthe exemption could offer a one-year $2,000 certificate of deposit witha different interest rate after the grandfather date. <T3>See </T3>footnote 11 above. Modifications that alter the type of product,however, are not permitted. Thus, a nonbank bank that marketed throughaffiliates on March 5, 1987, only certificates of deposit could not commencemarketing MMDA's or NOW accounts after the grandfather date.(ii) General changes in the character of the product or service as theresult of market or technological innovation are similarly permitted tothe extent that they do not transform a grandfathered product into a newproduct. Thus, an unsecured line of credit could not be modified to includea lien on the borrower's residence without becoming a new product.(6) <T3>Meaning of ``offer or market''. </T3>In the Board's opinion, the terms``offer or market'' in the cross-marketing restrictions refer to the presentationto a customer of an institution's products or service through any typeof program, including telemarketing, advertising brochures, direct mailing,personal solicitation, customer referrals, or joint-marketing agreementsor presentations. An institution must have offered or actually marketedthe product or service on March 5 or shortly before that date (as discussedabove) to qualify for the grandfather privilege. Thus, if the cross-marketingprogram was in the planning stage on March 5, 1987, the program would notquality for grandfather treatment under CEBA.(7) <T3>Limitations on cross-marketing to ``in the same manner''.</T3> (i)The cross-marketing restriction in section 4(f)(3) contains a grandfatherprovision that permits products or services that would otherwise be prohibitedfrom being offered or marketed under the provision to continue to be offeredor marketed by a particular entity if the products or services were beingso offered or marketed as of March 5, 1987, but ``only in the same mannerin which they were being offered or marketed as of that date.'' Thus, toqualify for the grandfather provision, the manner of offering or marketingthe otherwise prohibited product or service must remain the same as onthe grandfather date.(ii) In interpreting this provision, the Board notes that Congress designedthe joint-marketing restrictions to prevent the significant risk to thepublic posed by the conduct of such activities by insured banks affiliatedwith companies engaged in general commerce, to ensure objectivity in thecredit-granting process and to ``minimize the unfair competitive advantagethat grandfathered commercial companies owning nonbank banks might otherwiseengage over regulated bank holding companies and our competing commercialcompanies that have no subsidiary bank.'' Conference Report at 125-126.The Board believes that determinations regarding the manner of cross-marketingof a particular product or service may best be accomplished by applyingthe limitation to the particular facts in each case consistent with thestated purpose of this provision of CEBA and the general principle thatgrandfather restrictions and exceptions to general prohibitions must benarrowly construed in order to prevent the exception from nullifying therule. Essentially, as in the scope of the term ``product or service'',the guiding principle of Congressional intent with respect to this termis to permit only the continuation of the sepcific types of cross-marketingactivity that were undertaken as of March 5, 1987.(8) <T3>Eligibility for cross-marketing grandfather exemption. </T3>The ConferenceReport also clarifies that entitlement to an exemption to continue to cross-marketproducts and services otherwise prohibited by the statute applies onlyto the specific company that was engaged in the activity as of March 5,1987. Conference Report at 126. Thus, an affiliate that was not engagedin cross-marketing products or services as of the grandfather date maynot commence these activities under the exemption even if such activitieswere being conducted by another affiliate. <T3>Id.</T3>; <T3>see also </T3>S. Rep. No. 100-19 at 33-34.(e) <T3>Eligibility for grandfathered nonbank bank status. </T3>In reviewingthe reports required by CEBA, the Board notes that a number of institutionsthat had not commenced business operations on August 10, 1987, the dateof enactment of CEBA, claimed grandfather privileges under section 4(f)(3)of CEBA. To qualify for grandfather privileges under section 4(f)(3), theinstitution must have ``bec[o]me a bank as a result of the enactment of[CEBA]'' and must have been controlled by a nonbanking company on March5, 1987. 12 U.S.C. 1843(f)(1)(A). An institution that did not have FDICinsurance on August 10, 1987, and that did not accept demand deposits ortransaction accounts or engage in the business of commercial lending onthat date, would not have become a ``bank'' as a result of enactment ofCEBA. Thus, institutions that had not commenced operations on August 10,1987, could not qualify for grandfather privileges under section 4(f)(3)of CEBA. This view is supported by the activity limitations of section4(f)(3), which, as noted, limit the activities of grandfathered nonbankbanks to those in which they were lawfully engaged as of March 5, 1987.A nonbank bank that had not commenced conducting business activities onMarch 5, 1987, could not after enactment of CEBA engage in any activitiesunder this provision.<ITAG tagnum="21">Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
