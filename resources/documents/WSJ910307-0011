Robert Elfering, who had been marketing manager for UnisysDefense Systems in Eagan, Minn., during the late 1980s,admitted that the conspiracy involved paying consultants forinside information about the status of the radar-command andground-control contract, and then trying to hide illicitactivities once military officials became suspicious.</LP><TEXT>   The plea agreement, filed in federal court in Alexandria,Va., is the latest conviction stemming from a long-runningnationwide investigation of Pentagon bribery andinfluence-peddling, code-named &quot;Operation Ill Wind.&quot;   While both the tainted Marine Corps contract and the namesof the consultants Mr. Elfering dealt with became publicmonths ago, the documents filed in court yesterday raise newquestions about how much higher-ranking Unisys executivesknew about illegal activities.   In the summer of 1987, according to the documents, Navycomplaints prompted one of the unit's vice presidents to moveto cancel a consulting contract. But documents indicate thatat that time, one of the conspirators explained that companyofficials decided against taking such a drastic step because&quot;it might look like they had been doing something wrong.&quot; Thevice president isn't identified in the papers.   The contract eventually was awarded to Grumman Corp., eventhough the Unisys unit received inside information about thePentagon's evaluation of the competing bids.   Mr. Elfering, who agreed to cooperate with thegovernment's continuing investigation of Unisys and othertargets of the grand-jury investigation, faces a maximumsentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</TEXT></DOC>
