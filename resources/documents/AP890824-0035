The National Wildlife Federation asked the appeals court hereWednesday to reinstate a law requiring shrimpers to use devices thatlet sea turtles escape their nets.   The group is challenging Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher'sdecision allowing shrimpers to limit trawling time to 105 minutes inlieu of turtle excluder devices known as TEDs.   The federation was rebuffed Tuesday by a U.S. District Courtjudge, who refused the group's request that shrimpers be required toimmediately return to using TEDs.   Conservationists argue that only TEDs are effective in preventingthousands of endangered sea turtles from becoming caught inshrimpers nets and drowning.   The temporary regulations on restricted tow times, drafted undera court order by U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan, are in effectthrough Sept. 8, when Mosbacher must issue final rules.   Mosbacher suspended enforcement of the TEDs regulations July 24after a weekend of protests by shrimpers who say the devices reducetheir catch and threaten their livelihood.</TEXT><NOTE>NTSB Recommends New Safety Devices on Airliner Cargo Doors</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Transportation Safety Board isrecommending the use of ``failsafe'' mechanisms on airliner cargodoor latches to prevent doors from ope and ensure they are properlyclosed before takeoffs.   Nine people aboard a United Airlinesof a plane and killed inFebruary because of an apparent cargo door failure. The NTSB saidWednesday that its investigation of that incident shows that theoriginal design of the doors on Boeing 747 models ``does not proforthe failsafe features intended.''   The NTSB's seven-page safety recommendation to the FenAdministration said airliners should have redundant indicators todirectly pinpoint the position of latch cam on the cargo doors.   The board also recommended torque-limiting devices be installedon both the manual and electrical drives for cargo door latches toprevent damage to the lock mechanisms during their operation.   While saying not determined the cause of the Feb. 24 accidentover the Pacific Ocean, the board said the evidence ``stronglysuggests that the forward cargo door opened in flight and led to thesubsequent damage.''   Yet to be determined, the board said, is whether the cargo doorwas not latched or only partially latched before takeoff or if itbecame unlatched.</TEXT><NOTE>FTC Rules Against New England Rate Bureau</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Trade Commission says the NewEngland Motor Rate Bureau illegally fixed rates charged by carriershauling goods in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.   The commission, by a 3-1 vote Wednesday, ordered the Boston-basedbureau to halt its collective rate-making activities in most statesand to cancel within six months all tariffs it has filed in thosestates.   The commission charged NEMRB and its member carriers in 1983,saying that they hindered competition in Massachusetts, Rhode Islandand New Hampshire.   The opinion noted that in Massachusetts, the state Department ofPublic Utilities didn't exercise its supervisory authority overrates, subjecting the NEMRB's collective rate paying to federal``antitrust scrutiny.''   New Hampshire neither reviews rates nor has the authority tosuspend or reject rates, the FTC noted. In Rhode Island, however,the laws met the federal requirements for being exempt from federalantitrust regulation.   NEMRB offices were closed, and no representative could beidentified to reach after hours for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
