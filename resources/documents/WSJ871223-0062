The poll, conducted shortly after the former Colorado senator announced last week that he would rejoin the presidential race, shows that Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts still holds a commanding lead in the state with the nation's first primary. According to the poll, Mr. Dukakis is the choice of 43% of the Democrats in New Hampshire, down from the 49% who said they would support him a month ago, when there were no suggestions Mr. Hart would reactivate his candidacy.    The survey of 701 likely primary voters, conducted last weekend among the same voters who were surveyed in November, shows that Mr. Hart and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois each attract the support of 16%.    The poll indicates that slightly more than a third of the new Hart supporters were previously Dukakis supporters. Still, it suggests that Mr. Hart's re-entry may be more damaging to other candidates like Rep. Richard Gephardt, still mired at single digits in the polls, who can least afford any defections.    The likely Democratic voters, by a three-to-one margin, say they don't place much importance on whether a candidate has been faithful to his spouse. But most have a negative view of Mr. Hart, with 53% saying they have an unfavorable opinion of him and 35% saying they have a positive opinion.    By a similar 53%-35% margin, these voters wish he hadn't re-entered the race. Two out of three don't think he can win the party's nomination and more than half say they believe his re-entry into the campaign is an example of his bad judgment. </TEXT></DOC>
