Anger about the government's fishing-license law was the oddestbut hardly the least significant issue in Ireland's nationalelection Thursday.   The nation's unwanted reputation as a net exporter of people wasan issue, closely linked with continuing high unemployment.   Cuts in the national health service brought complaints ofpatients being left on gurneys because no beds were available, andevery party promised to spend money to improve matters.   In western Ireland, the fishing license uproar dominated thecampaign. ``I am totally baffled by it,'' Prime Minister CharlesHaughey confessed. ``I think it's the most extraordinary developmentever in Irish politics.''   Haughey's government pushed through the license plan _ 15 pounts(about $20.25) a year for trout and 10 pounds (about $13.50) forother fish, effective Jan. 1, 1988.   Outraged anglers aren't just refusing to pay. They've shut downfishing in trout-filled waters such as Lough Corrib, and with it thetourist industry.   Signs around Oughterard, on the lough shore, scream defiance:``no rod license.''   In County Galway, the combined fishing clubs turned out 200members to canvass against candidates from Haughey's Fianna Failparty.   The rod license made political bedfellows of candidates of FineGael, the party of shopkeepers, and the Workers Party, Ireland'sdisciples of Karl Marx.   Michael Ryan, who owns a guest house in Cong and chairs the localFianna Fail branch, campaigned this year for an independent whoopposed the rod license.   ``I'm not changing my politics,'' he said. ``I'm just fightingthem on this issue.''   Eamon O Cuiv, a member of the Dail, or parliament, from GalwayWest, said he hears about the issue ``every day of the week, notjust here but right around the country.''   ``It's only 15 pounds,'' Haughey declared in exasperation on aradio phone-in program.   It's not pounds but principles, said a caller, to which Haugheyretorted: ``Principles get people in an awful lot of trouble.''   The fish license was only one of the burning issues as the 2.4million eligible voters went to the polls to choose among 367candidates for the 166-seat Dail.   Turnout was 20 percent by lunchtime, on target to match the 73percent in 1987. Voters were also electing 15 members to theEuropean Parliament.   Haughey found himself in a lot of trouble over cuts in the healthservice.   In pursuit of lower budget deficits, the 63-year-old primeminister closed 15 hospitals with the loss of 3,600 beds.   In the last general election, in 1987, Haughey had campaignedagainst the health cuts proposed by the Fine Gael-Labor coalitiongovernment, and he has been reminded frequently of Fianna Failbillboards two years ago which said: ``HEALTH CUTS HURT THE OLD, THESICK AND THE HANDICAPPED.''   Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, a 44-year-old Dublin economist,promised to take $40 million from the National Lottery and spend iton health. Haughey has promised total health expenditures of $1.75billion.   Emigration, which had been 24,000 a year under Haughey'spredecessor, Garret FitzGerald, has climbed past 30,000 duringHaughey's watch.   Campaigning in Arklow, Dukes heard Fine Gael Councillor VincentMcElheron tally the losses: 600 gone from the town in eight months,four families departed just from one row of six houses. ``We used tohave a boom town,'' McElheron said. ``Now it's dead.''   Haughey pointed to 20,000 new jobs in manufacturing and trade in1988. Subtract the lost jobs and it was only a net gain of 3,000,but that was the first significant increase after the country lost75,000 jobs between 1980 and 1987.   Soldiers' pay also figures. Three soldiers' wives were running onthe single issue of better pay for their husbands.   Haughey continued to preach fiscal restraint, sometimes at apersonal level.   To a woman in Kilkenny who shouted a demand for a 5 percentincrease in the widows' pension, Haughey retorted: ``You're youngenough and good looking enough to get married again.''</TEXT></DOC>
