The error-ratesare no more than one or two per ten thousand. Even when the elementsare reduced to 10, there is still in these cases excellent characterization.When only 6 elements are employed, uniqueness is seriously compromised.Results based on less than elements are essentially meaningless. 2) Inseveral other cases, there is a small error rate, typically 1-4%, ina Euclidean search utilizing even 17 elements. Short Euclidean distancescannot prove archaeological affiliation but, when combined with concordanceof stylistic criteria, similarity in paste petrography, etc., may nowgive strong additional evidence as to long-distance contacts. It wassuggested that the widespread occurrence of bivariate correlation innatural clays and archaeological ceramics could considerably sharpenthe uniqueness of the ``fingerprint'' characterization of archaeologicalgroups if one first transformed the space in such a way as to removethe correlations from the focal group. Those of us who have been involvedin the characterization of archaeological ceramics through their analyticalcompositional signatures have had the intuitive feeling that the methodworked fairly well; that one could distinguish sherds that lay in orout of particular clusters with some assurance, provided one employeda sufficient number of elements. The present paper demonstrates justhow good that characterization can become, and roughly how many elementsneed be considered, to achieve a reliable result. 27 refs., 13 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
