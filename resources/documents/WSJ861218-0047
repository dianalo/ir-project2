Kennedy.    Miss Kennedy, 56 years old, is administrative assistant to Douglas D. Danforth, chairman. She joined Westinghouse as a stenographer in 1952. Westinghouse, which has about 125,000 employees and 36 vice presidents, has been criticized by employees and executive recruiters for failing to name women and minorities to top and middle management positions.    &quot;I'm not aware that there is much criticism,&quot; a Westinghouse spokesman said. He added that Westinghouse is an &quot;engineering company,&quot; and said that few women have entered that field.    The spokesman said Miss Kennedy's administrative responsibilities won't change with her new position. He couldn't say what position is held by the next highest-placed woman at the company. &quot;It depends who you ask,&quot; he said. &quot;We'd say there is a significant number of highly placed women.&quot;    Westinghouse, which has interests in construction, electronics, finance and broadcasting, has one woman director, Barbara H. Franklin, senior fellow of public management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. </TEXT></DOC>
