Coden.andM;Products incorporating POF should follow before the end of the year,according to Codenoll officials.andP;  &quot;Codenoll and GM [will make] the power offiber optics affordable to the end user,&quot; Coden said.andM;POF is appropriate for work-group networks ranging in speed from 10Mbps to300Mbps; in turn, glass fiber-optic networks are most appropriate forbackbones, long distances and the highest-performance networks, he said.andM;POF is a result of a six-year joint development effort between Codenoll andGM.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
