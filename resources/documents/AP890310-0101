Government spokesmen had promised that full civil rights would berestored on Thursday. But the decision was revised to include onlyfreedom of speech, Interior Minister Alejandro Izaguirre said ontelevision Thursday night.   ``The government considers it prudent to maintain the suspensionof some of the measures,'' Izaguirre said without elaborating.   Under the suspension, authorities can continue to arrest peoplewithout charges, enter homes at will, prohibit demonstrations andpublic meetings and restrict freedom of movement.   The military will continue to patrol the streets, Izaguirre said.   University students protesting the latest austerity measure,higher bus fares, began the week of violence Feb. 27.
