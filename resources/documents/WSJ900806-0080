Most of the union pilots still aren't flying for theairline. After being nearly grounded by a strike andsubsequent bankruptcy-law filing last year, Eastern refilledits cockpits with 1,800 replacement pilots and pilots whocrossed the picket lines. By the time the Air Line PilotsAssociation abandoned its job action last November, theairline said it had all the pilots it needed and refused toreinstate the former strikers.</LP><TEXT>   Eastern has said repeatedly that any pilots strike wouldbe a &quot;non-event.&quot; Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the court-appointedtrustee who is running Eastern, said, &quot;It's hard tounderstand how pilots who are not working can go on strike.&quot;   Eastern's 3,600 pilots initially went on strike insympathy with the airline's machinists. The current disputecenters on the contract for pilots, in which they have saidthey are willing to forfeit wage increases in favor ofgetting their old jobs back.   The pilots union said contract talks are scheduled toresume this week, supervised by the National Mediation Board,the federal agency that oversees airline labor.   Federal mediators last month declared the two sides at animpasse, and began a 30-day countdown that expires atmidnight EDT Aug. 10, after which the airline could imposeits own contract and the pilots would be free to strike.</TEXT></DOC>
