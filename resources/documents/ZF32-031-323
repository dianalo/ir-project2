ZimmermanandM;Amkly Systems Inc. last week at NetWorld announced a new line of PCspositioned as network workstations.andM;The Amkly Station line of computers, which is made up of 20MHz 386SX, 20MHzand 25MHz 486SX, and 33MHz 486-based systems, mirrors the company's existingE-Series of Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) computers.andP;  Butsuch items as its PC-based architecture, limited board expandability and highlevel of security distinguish the Amkly Station from its EISA counterpart,said Robert Kutnick, vice president of strategic business development atAmkly, in Irvine, Calif.andM;&quot;The andlsqb;Amkly Stationandrsqb; is limited in some ways, but it's designed to be anetwork station, so we've built in capabilities that network administratorswill like,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It can accommodate a hard drive, but the administratorcan restrict the user's access of that drive, for example.&quot;andM;The new PCs are equipped with three levels of security: The most secure levelis the &quot;administrator&quot; level, followed by the PC &quot;owner&quot; level and then the&quot;guest&quot; level, said Kutnick.andP;  The PCs also feature Flash ROM, which enablesLAN administrators to update the BIOS of all nodes from the file server, saidKutnick.andM;Amkly's 386SX/20 comes with 1M byte of RAM (expandable to 16M bytes) and a32K-byte cache, and the 486SX/20 and 486SX/25 include 1M byte of RAM(expandable to 52M bytes) and an 8K-byte cache.andP;  The 486/33 comes with 4Mbytes of RAM (expandable to 52M bytes) and an 8K-byte cache.andM;All four Amkly Station PCs come with two 16-bit expansion slots and theability to house 1.2M- or 1.44M-byte floppy drives, as well as a hard driveranging in size between 40M bytes and 200M bytes.andM;Pricing for the systems, which will be shipped this month through VARs anddealers, ranges from $1,095 to $2,995.andM;Amkly can be reached at (714) 727-0788.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
