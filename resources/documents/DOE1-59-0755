Seventeenpatients had liver metastases and were followed between 3 and 66 monthswith serial examinations during treatment with chemotherapeutic agentsand interferon. The efficiency of the various techniques to detect metastaseswas investigated. Analysis of changes in tumour size during treatmentwas made to see if treatment effects could be monitored with radiologicexaminations. Ultrasonography was the best non-invasive method for detectionof metastases and is recommended as standard method for imaging in thisgroup of patients. Angiography was even better showing extremely smallmetastases, less than 5 mm, and is recommended in selected cases. Withone exception, no significant change in tumour size was noted in spiteof clear laboratory and clinical signs of therapy effect indicating thattumour size determination is not useful for therapy monitoring in thistype of disease.</TEXT></DOC>
