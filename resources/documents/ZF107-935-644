 The only LaserWriter you can connect to a hard disk for font storage isthe IINTX, because it's the only one with a built-in SCSI port for thatpurpose.andP;  With a LaserWriter Plus (or its current equivalent in Apple'sproduct line, the LaserWriter IINT), your only option besides waiting forfonts to download automatically each time you print is to manually downloadfonts to your printer's RAM and then leave the printer turned on.andM;Not EnoughandM;Finder MemoryandM;Q.andP;  I have a Macintosh SE/30 using System 6.0.3.andP;  When MultiFinder isrunning, I have trouble opening disks that contain more than about 100 filesand folders.andP;  I get the error message &quot;There isn't enough Finder memory towork with the disk.&quot;andP;  I have no problem opening the same 1.44-megabyte diskswith MultiFinder turned off.andP;  Is there a way around this, short of reducingthe number of files on my disks?andM;Steve WellonsandM;Charleston, WVandM;A.andP;  The Finder comes set with a MultiFinder partition size of 160K, which issufficient for most Finder operations.andP;  If, on the other hand, you do a lotof copy or have disks with a large number of files on them, the Finder mayrun out of memory.andM;The way around this is to increase the Finder's MultiFinder partition size.andO;To do this, locate the Finder in your System Folder.andP;  Do a Get Info(Command-I) on the file; in the lower right corner of the window, you willsee a small box that contains the partition size.andP;  The default value is 160K.andO;Change it to a larger value, and restart your Mac.andP;  If you then choose theAbout the Finder menu item on the Apple menu, you'll see that the Finder'spartition has changed to the size you specified.andM;If the Finder still runs out of memory, experiment until you find a size thatallows you to complete the Finder operations you normally perform.andP;  Becareful not to set the partition too large, though.andP;  Unlike an application,the Finder never quis under MultiFinder, so the memory allocated to theFinder is always in use, making it unavailable for use by other applications.andM;Upgrading a 512KEandM;Q.andP;  What are the options for upgrading my Macintosh 512KE?andP;  It seems thatmost software is now written for machines with more memory, and I'm left outin the cold.andM;Christopher BenderandM;Mt.andP;  Pleasant, SCandM;A.andP;  You have several options, depending on what programs you want to run.andO;You can soup up your 512KE with 4 megabytes of RAM, which is enough to runmemory-hungry programs such as 4th Dimension, FullWrite rofessional, Excel2.2, and many graphics packages.andP;  If you don't use software that requires alot of memory, you can comfortably run MultiFinder or HyperCard with 2megabytes.andM;Your Apple dealer can install a 1-to-4-megabyte logic board and SCSI port forabout $600 (this upgrades you to a Mac Plus).andM;Among the third-party vendors offering upgrades is Dove Computer (1200 N.andO;23rd St., Wilmington, NC 28405; [919] 763-7918), which sells MacSnap upgrades(with or without SCSI), which can take you to 1 or 2 megabytes of memory.andP;  Analternative is Brainstorm from MacDoctor Electronics (1145 Terra Bella Ave.,andO;Mountain View, CA 94043; [415] 964-2131), which you can install yourself andwhich allows you to upgrade to 1, 2, or 4 megabytes.andM;Whichever route you take, consider whether you are going to want to upgradeyour upgrade.andP;  Some upgrades allow you to increase memory as well aseventually add on such things as accelerator boards or video-interface cards.andM;Disk Life ExpectancyandM;Q.andP;  I read an interesting (and alarming) statement that the shelf life of adisk is two to three years at most.andP;  What is the source of this statement,and what is the best way to protect archival disks?andM;Paul LeinbachandM;Winter Park, FLandM;A.andP;  The statement's probable source is personal experience: Most of what iswritten about this subject is confined to exhortations to back up your disksat least once a day.andP;  The bottom line is that magnetic media deteriorate overtime.andP;  The length of time depends on several environmental factors.andM;You can make your disks' home life as healthy as possible by taking somecommon-sense precautions: Store disks out of direct sunlight and away frommagnetic fields such as your stereo speakers, your phone, a fluorescentlight, or a computer screen.andP;  In addition, stack your disks to keep them fromwarping, and avoid extremes of temperature and humidity.andP;  Another safeguardis to copy your archival data onto new disks every two years or so.andM;PostScript Text FilesandM;Q.andP;  In MacUser's roundup of PostScript printers (&quot;Fit to Print,&quot; September'89), it became apparent that the clone printers were by far the best buys ofthe lot.andP;  The authors did warn of two problems: The clones take a long timedownloading nonresident fonts, and they don't work with Adobe's Type 1 fonts,in which most service bureaus have invested heavily.andM;But isn't it true that you can send any PostScript file to a service bureau,regardless of what fonts that bureau has in-house, simply by usingPageMaker's Command-F feature to print an ASCII PostScript text version ofyour file to disk?andP;  Granted, this can result in some enormous text files, butseveral thousand typefaces are lurking about in the world, and only a smallfraction of them are available from Adobe.andP;  Why limit yourself?andM;Craig FederhenandM;Kingston, NHandM;A.andP;  First of all, now that Adobe has announced that it will publish thespecifications for its Type 1 fonts, we can look forward to an era ofPostScript-clone printers that print those fonts as easily as any others.andO;That said, there are a couple of disadvantages to printing your PageMakerdocument to disk and sending it to a service bureau.andP;  As you noted, if yourdocument uses a lot of fonts besides the standard 35 resident LaserWriterfonts, the PostScript text file that you create will be substantially biggerthan the original PageMaker file.andP;  By relying on the service bureau toprovide the font information, you save a lot of space.andP;  And what if somethinggoes wrong when you get your file to the service bureau?andP;  If the servicebureau has only your PostScript text file, it will find it next to impossibleto troubleshoot your job.andM;The font market is in the middle of some major upheavals right now, so mostservice bureaus may start to carry fonts from more than one supplier.andP;  In themeantime, Adobe remains the dominant standard.andM;Hard-Disk RepairsandM;Q.andP;  Nine months after I bought a Mac SE with a 20-megabyte hard drive, thehard drive failed.andP;  When I took my Mac back to where I'd bought it, theservice technician told me that my Mac would need a new hard drive (at a costof $650).andP;  When I picked up my Mac after the hard drive was replaced, all theinformation that was on the hard drive I took in was on the new hard disk.andO;Is it possible to transfer from a damaged hard disk to a serviceable disk, ordid I get ripped off?andM;Alan S. LewisandM;San Bernardino, CAandM;A.andP;  Yes, it's possible to transfer data from a damaged hard disk.andP;  What yourexperience most likely means is that the technician went beyond the call ofduty by salvaging the data from your damaged disk.andP;  If your concern is thatthe drive was not replaced, you are perfectly within your rights to ask yourdealer for the paperwork documenting the repair, which should give you theold and the new drives' serial numbers and prove that a new drive wasinstalled.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
