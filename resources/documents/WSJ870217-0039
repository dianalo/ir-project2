In its directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which carries out monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee said that &quot;slightly greater&quot; or &quot;somewhat lesser&quot; restraint would be acceptable. However, several members believed that Fed policy makers &quot;should remain especially alert&quot; to developments that might call for a somewhat easier policy, in light of the downside risks to the economic outlook.    These members contended that the &quot;relative stability&quot; of the dollar in foreign exchange markets in the months preceding the meeting provided &quot;greater flexibility&quot; for easing.    Minutes of the meeting were released Friday after the customary delay of six to eight weeks. The panel met again last week to set monetary targets for this year, and Fed Chairman Paul Volcker is scheduled to testify about the economic outlook on Capitol Hill this week.    At the December session, the committee noted that broad price measures had firmed somewhat in recent months, largely because of food and energy price increases. Wage inflation had continued at a moderate pace despite a small recent pickup, according to the minutes.    The committee said it expected growth in the broader measures of the money supply at an annual rate of about 7% from November to March. Growth of M1, the narrowest measure of the money supply, would continue to be considered in light of the behavior of the other measures, among other factors, the panel said.    The members said the outlook for M1 growth &quot;remained highly uncertain&quot; although &quot;underlying forces seemed consistent with a considerable slowing&quot; from the rapid expansion of 1986.    Also, in a preliminary discussion about the money-supply growth targets for 1987, most members didn't favor establishing a formal target range for M1. Many, however, believed the measure should continue to be monitored in light of information about the economy, and prices, among other things.    The minutes state that the panel members gave considerable attention to the outlook for foreign trade. While they found that the weakened dollar had enhanced the competitive position of U.S. companies, it found &quot;no convincing evidence thus far of a turnaround in the trade balance.&quot;    The committee decided to keep the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge on overnight loans to each other, unchanged at 4% to 8%.    The open market committee consists of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board and five Federal Reseve bank presidents. The vote at the December meeting was 10-0. Emmett Rice, who had announced plans to resign effective Dec. 31, was absent, as was Henry Wallich, who had just resigned from the board.    President Reagan has said he plans to nominate Edward Kelley, a Houston investment counselor, to fill Mr. Rice's term. The president probably won't nominate anyone to fill the Wallich seat for several months. </TEXT></DOC>
