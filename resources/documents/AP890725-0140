King to head the SocialSecurity Administration, and she promised efforts to improve theretirement and disability system.   Mrs. King, whose nomination was approved by voice vote and sentto the full Senate, promised to ``reach out to the most vulnerableamong those we serve and ensure for them the `security' that is ourmission.''   A fomer aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh when he wasgovernor of Pennsylvania and to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., Mrs. Kingsaid she would work to create ``a fairer, more efficient and humaneSocial Security system.''   The Social Security Administration, with an annual budget of$230 billion, currently provides 38.6 million people with monthlyretirement, disability or survivor's benefits.   As part of a program to streamline and modernize its operations,the agency pared its workforce by about 20 percent during theReagan administration years to about 65,000 employees. Critics havecomplained of a drop in the quality of service to the public and oflow employee morale.   John N. Sturdivant, president of the American Federation ofGovernment Employees, which represents 55,000 Social Securityemployees, said the union did not oppose Mrs. King's nomination andhoped to work with her to solve ``serious problems.''   ``By all accounts, both managers and rank and file employees arerapidly sinking under the burden of an ever-growing workload andthe fact that they cannot service the public as it deserves to beserved,'' he said.   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., expressed confidence Mrs.King's nomination would be approved and said the new administratorwill take over an agency that has suffered from ``instability inleadership,'' going through 10 administrators in the last 16 years.   Moynihan said the new administrator will have to defend SocialSecurity's trust funds against use for deficit reduction or othergovernment purposes and also will face low public confidence aboutthe future of the benefits program.   ``Social Security is one of the greatest governmental successstories of the century, but people don't believe it,'' he said.   Mrs. King currently is an executive vice president of theWashington government relations firm of Gogol andamp; Associates. Shewould replace Dorcas Hardy, who last month announced she wouldresign July 31.   The Finance Committee also approved by voice vote Tuesday thenominations of Linda M. Combs to be assistant treasury secretaryfor management, Thomas J. Duesterberg to be an assistant secretaryof commerce, and Wade F. Horn to be chief of the Children's Bureauin the Department of Health and Human Services.</TEXT></DOC>
