The book is setup in six sections. Section 1 is an introduction and description. Section2 is an overview of wind energy markets and market trends based on thecollected statistical data. As with the book itself, this overview isnot an all-inclusive review of the wind industry but rather a focusedpacket of information on wind turbine manufacturers, turbine shipments,overall turbine characteristics, etc. Section 3 provides statistics onthe overall wind turbine market by region, with eight regions makingup the world. The data are provided for the 1981-1986 period. Section4 cross-cuts the statistics by rotor diameter. As the report discusses,rotor diameter appears to provide a more consistent frame of referencethan nameplate rating, wind speed performance, or other similar characteristics.Section 5 breaks down the statistics by nine applications, ranging fromwater heating and water pumping to grid-connected windfarms. Section6 catalogs wind turbine manufacturing and export/import activity. Supportingstatistics are provided at the end of Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6. An appendixprovides detailed descriptions of the approximately 150 active wind turbinemanufacturers worldwide and their wind turbines.</TEXT></DOC>
