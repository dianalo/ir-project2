Is it really that difficult to see that more people use morespace, more water, more natural resources while they dump more and more wasteinto the ground, the ocean and the air?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LIMITING FAMILY SIZE WOULD SAVE EARTH  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     The Earth is not getting bigger. It is rather obvious that unless we stopour population growth, our individual space will get slowly squeezed downuntil we will all live in match-size boxes, drinking strictly rationedrecycled water, and forests and wildlife will only exist in history books.;   The swelling number of the poor and destitute will increase beyondcomprehension the social unrest throughout the world. No amount of welfare andaid can equalize the negative economic consequences of having too many kids inan already impoverished family.;    Why is the idea of not having more thantwo kids per family so difficult to accept? Why can't civic and religiousgroups discuss and promote such a simple solution to much of our problems? Dowe have to wait until it is too late?;    -- Peter M. Vadasz; Los Gatos;  TRIPTO DISNEYLAND: WAS IT WORTH IT?;    Just having returned from Los Angeles(which, needless to say, included a visit to Disneyland) with memories of abizarre experience fresh in my mind, I just couldn't help but relate to BobGarfield's views (Commentary, July 11).;    I recently migrated to the UnitedStates and was visiting the park with my husband. Not only were the admissiontickets highly overpriced, but so were the food and beverages. It must be sodifficult for parents to say no to any of their kids' demands, justified orotherwise, since the family is supposed to be &quot;out on vacation&quot; to have&quot;fun&quot;!;    It is the parents (with the wallets) who have to bear the brunt,without losing their tempers or making their displeasure obvious. After all,the effort that went into making it to a particular ride (waiting in queue inthe heat for God knows how long), we did come out and wonder, was it worthit?;    -- Rachna Dhir; Sunnyvale;  RAIL RIGHT-OF-WAY PRICE IS TOO HIGH; SanMateo County Supervisor Tom Nolan and other local politicians have beencriticized by Sen. Quentin Kopp, I-San Francisco, for agreeing to pay too muchfor the San Francisco-to-San Jose railroad right-of-way. The agreement to payabout $12.5 million toward the old Dumbarton Rail bridge supports SenatorKopp's contention that public interests are not being served adequately.;   In 1988, San Mateo County voters agreed to include the $12.5 million inMeasure A for the Dumbarton rail right-of-way. Since that time a feasibilitystudy has revealed that the old bridge requires in excess of $25 million inrepairs. Despite this new information the &quot;negotiated&quot; price for the Dumbartonright-of-way is still the $12.5 million the voters approved in 1988. It looksto me as though Nolan and company are asleep at the switch.;    -- James A.Dei Rossi; Menlo Park  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910722  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  537  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 22, 199100204205,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
