Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, told the House Banking Committee that the request was madeby Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; AlanCranston, D-Calif., and John McCain, R-Ariz., at an April 2, 1987,meeting in DeConcini's office.   ``Sen. DeConcini ... said he and the other senators were thereon behalf of their friend at Lincoln Savings ...,'' Gray said. ``Hesaid that if I withdraw the regulation ... they would get theirfriend to make more home loans.''   ``It sounded like a quid pro quo,'' he testified. ``It was aquid pro quo. I told Sen. DeConcini I would not withdraw theregulation.''   Bob Maynes, a spokesman for DeConcini, said the Arizona senatorand three other senators have consistently taken issue with Gray'sdescription of the meeting.   ``There were five people in that room _ Gray and the foursenators,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``and all foursenators have said on the record that Gray is totally andcompletely inaccurate.''   Maynes said a description of the meeting provided subsequentlyby William T. Black of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's regionaloffice in San Francisco supports the senators' accounts of what hadtranspired there. Maynes said Black's account of the meeting wasbased on a briefing he had been given by Gray.   The four senators have acknowledged that they received more than$1.1 million in political contributions raised by Phoenixmillionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of AmericanContinental Corp., parent company of the Irvine, Calif.-basedLincoln.   The regulation, which was put into effect last summer only aspart of a $157 billion taxpayer bailout of the Sandamp;L industry, wouldhave curtailed Lincoln from continuing to invest federallly insureddeposits in risky real estate ventures.   As the result of those investments which later turned sour, thegovernment last April sezied control of Lincoln at an estimatedcost of up to $2 billion to taxpayers for repaying savers whosefederally insured deposits were lost.   ``Sens. Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn and McCain had evidentlybought off on the scheme when they met with me,'' Gray testified.``The receipt of very substantial gifts from Charles Keating andhis associates had long since put them in the right frame of mindto ... embrace the notion that there was somehow a vendetta againstLincoln'' by regulators.   ``When enough money flows, it's apparently easier to begullible,'' Gray said.   He recalled that Keating also had hired Alan Greenspan, nowchairman of the Federal Reserve Board and then a private economist,to press his case that Lincoln's investments were sound and argueagainst the need for the regulation.   Gray also outlined how former Treasury Secretary and White Housechief of staff Donald T. Regan orchestrated President Reagan'sappointment of Lee Henkel, a business associate of Keating, to thebank board.   ``Charles Keating had finally achieved his wish,'' Gray said.``Mr. Keating had gotten this far because of his politicalinfluence _ translate that as money _ all the way to and throughthe White House .... And with friends like Sens. DeConcini, McCain,Glenn and Cranston, what was to stop him?''   Keating also had been scheduled to testify today, but his newattorney on Monday asked that his appearance be postponed for twoweeks. Today's hearing was the fourth held by the Banking Committeeon why Lincoln was allowed to keep operating for two years afterfederal examiners said it was posing a threat to the government'sdeposit insurance funds.   Bank board officials in California recommended on May 1, 1987,that the government seize Lincoln because of its mounting losses.Gray, whose term expired two months later, passed the problem on tohis successor, M. Danny Wall, now director of the new Office ofThrift Supervision in the Treasury Department.   Lincoln was seized by the bank board in April, nearly two yearsafter federal examiners first recommended taking it over.   The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created by Congress toclean up the thrift mess, filed a $1.1 billion suit in Septemberagainst Lincoln, American Continental, Keating and his relativesalleging fraud and racketeering.   Wall has acknowledged he met with Keating after taking officeand said he subsequently rejected the recommendation of the board'sregional office in San Francisco to take Lincoln over.   He has defended the action, saying the San Francisco officialshad enough information to restrict some of Lincoln's activities butnot enough to warrant taking it over without first going through alengthy court battle.   Instead, Wall ordered that supervision of the troubled thrift betransferred to the board's Washington headquarters while a secondaudit was conducted by field examiners from other parts of thecountry.   Members of the second team testified last week their audit washampered by directions from Bank Board officials in Washington toignore the previous audits and the high salaries that were paid toKeating and his relatives.</TEXT></DOC>
