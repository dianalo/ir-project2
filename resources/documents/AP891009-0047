Nidal's group has denied taking part in the kidnappings.   ``We have established that Abu Nidal's men carried out theabduction. We believe the hostages are held in a base east ofSidon,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be identified understanding regulations.   He said the base was ``between the villages of Majdalyoun andBkosta,'' three miles east of Sidon, the provincial capital ofsouth Lebanon.   ``The area is controlled exclusively by Abu Nidal's group,'' thespokesman said.   Masked gunmen grabbed the two Swiss men, Emmanuel Christen, 32,and Elio Erriquez, 23, in Sidon on Friday, bundled them into thetrunk of a car and drove off toward the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinianrefugee camp on Sidon's southeastern outskirts.   The police spokesman said the kidnappers drove through Einel-Hilweh to their base east of Sidon. Ein el-Hilweh is controlledby Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, which is atodds with Abu Nidals' breakaway faction.   Asked whether police would attempt to rescue the hostages, thespokesman said: ``We don't have the necessary force to do that. Wehave investigators, but not a strike force.''   Government and police authority power been severely eroded by 14years of civil war between Christians and Moslems, leaving powerlargely in the hands of militias.   Asked about Abu Nidal's reported involvement in the abductions,Roland Sidler, chief delegate of the International Committee of theRed Cross in south Lebanon, said: ``We have no new informationabout our missing colleagues.''   Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council issued a statement inBeirut Saturday condemning the abductions and offering to help freethe men, but police and the PLO have said they do not take thedenial seriously.   Abu Nidal is the nom de guerre of Sabri al-Banna, who broke awayfrom Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction in 1973. His faction hasbeen blamed for a score of terrorist attacks, including theDecember 1985 attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports.   Friday's kidnapping prompted the Red Cross to close itsorthopedic center in Sidon, which provided artificial limbs forcivil war and car bomb victims.   About 50 amputees in wheelchairs and on crutches, all of thempatients at the center, demonstrated outside the building Sunday,condemning the abductions and demanding the release of Christen andErriquez.   ``We had to close it because our two abducted comrades were thebackbone of the clinic's operations,'' Sidler said.   PLO spokesmen last week accused Abu Nidal's group of thekidnappings, linking them to a Shiite Moslem militant, MohammedHariri, who is serving a life sentence in Switzerland for hijackingan Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a French passenger.   Hariri, 22, is reputed to be a member of the Iranian-backedfundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to bethe umbrella for factions holding most of the 18 hostages inLebanon.   Eight of the hostages are Americans. The hostage held longest isTerry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress.   Abu Nidal's group, which is bankrolled by Libya, has a record ofcooperation with Hezbollah.   After U.S. warplanes bombed Libya's capital April 15, 1986, thebodies of three Western hostages were found two days later near ahighway in the central Lebanese mountains east of Beirut.   Beirut newspapers said at the time that the three victims, whohad been held by pro-Iranian militants loyal to Hezbollah, wereturned over to Abu Nidal's group to mete out vengeance for the U.S.raid.</TEXT></DOC>
