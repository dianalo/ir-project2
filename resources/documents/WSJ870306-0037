The president and his new chief of staff, Howard Baker, spent yesterday soliciting ideas from conservative leaders about how to advance the Reagan agenda following the president's Wednesday night speech on the Iran-Contra affair.    According to Reagan administration and congressional sources, the White House is receiving conflicting advice from Republican officials over when -- and whether -- to call a summit with congressional leaders aimed at producing a budget compromise.    Several powerful GOP lawmakers, including Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas and Senate Budget Committee member Pete Domenici of New Mexico, contend that agreeing to a summit too soon would cost the president leverage over the sensitive issues of spending and taxes. Their advice is expected to carry considerable weight with Mr. Baker, himself a former Republican senator.    Other GOP strategists are telling Mr. Baker and his aides that fallout from the Iran-Contra controversy remains serious and that the president must quickly show the nation that he is seizing the initiative by holding a budget summit. &quot;It's high risk. You can get sandbagged, but it's the best way to show he's deeply engaged in the business of government,&quot; contends one White House adviser.    Among those pushing this point of view, sources said, are former White House aide Kenneth Duberstein, who is reportedly under consideration for a senior White House post, and New Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman.    The Dole-Domenici faction is arguing that the president would be foolish to agree to a summit before the Democratic majority in Congress puts forward its own budget plan to comply with the Gramm-Rudman law. Unless the Democrats are forced to place deficit-reduction measures &quot;on the table,&quot; these strategists contend, the president will be unable to obtain any of the domestic spending cuts or defense spending increases he wants. And that, one top Senate Republican aide said, would make the president look weak.    But those urging a more conciliatory stance contend that the White House can't wait too long. They argue that a stalemate could lead to chaos in mid-May, when the government could face a closure if Congress doesn't pass a bill raising the Treasury's borrowing limit. In light of the Iran affair, one White House official worries, such disarray could enable Democrats to charge that the president is &quot;letting the government go to pieces again.&quot;    Mr. Baker, who has been on the job four days, made an effort yesterday to reassure his conservative critics that he won't undercut President Reagan's conservative agenda.    Mr. Baker invited some two dozen conservative senators, who call themselves the Senate Steering Committee, to the White House to give the president their advice. Among the policies the group urged, participants said, were full funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, a balanced-budget amendment, an all-out campaign to make Congress stick to Gramm-Rudman's deficit targets, and an attack on the Democrats for their recent talk of raising taxes.    Some of the president's oldest and most conservative supporters, including Attorney General Edwin Meese, former Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt, lobbyist Thomas Korologos and Heritage Foundation head Edwin Fuelner, were invited to a strategy session with Mr. Baker yesterday. At this lunch, participants said, Mr. Baker spoke of his commitment to SDI, and of his &quot;keen understanding&quot; that the &quot;sole job of the chief of staff is to implement the president's program.&quot; He also told the small group that he had &quot;no plan to interdict the access&quot; of the president's core supporters.    In addition, President Reagan yesterday began pushing for a longstanding item on his agenda. He sent up his request for the final $40 million of $100 million in aid that Congress voted for the anti-Sandinista rebels -- a package that Congress likely won't be able to block. Advisers to the president also said they expect him to start speaking out on the issue soon.    White House officials said that because of transition problems relating to the change in chiefs of staff, it was too early to say exactly what strategy President Reagan would pursue to try to get beyond the Iran-Contra debacle. &quot;We've scarcely had time to meet with each other,&quot; said a member of the Baker team.    Among the ideas being considered are a series of speeches by the president from outside of Washington on such topics as economic competitiveness and welfare revision, and possibly having him make a trip to Capitol Hill to lobby for his budget priorities.    In an effort to show the president in charge, thus combating the impression of detachment left by the Tower Commission report, President Reagan's advisers are likely to keep him visible and active. Tomorrow, for instance, he'll meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and with arms negotiators returning from Geneva, Switzerland.    Although President Reagan embraced the Tower Commission's report in his speech Wednesday, two of his cabinet officers yesterday took issue with the report. Secretary of State George Shultz, whom the report accused of keeping his distance from distasteful policies instead of trying to alter them, said, &quot;I do not agree that my actions were designed somehow or another to make a record to protect myself. I don't operate that way.&quot; And Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger denounced the report's suggestion that he had been a passive dissenter as &quot;unjustified and unwarranted,&quot; saying he had done everything possible to oppose the arms sales to Iran.    Vice President Bush, on the other hand, criticized himself yesterday. He told Iowa Republicans that he wishes he had &quot;seen the signals&quot; of the failed policy and &quot;been more help in some way.&quot;    ---   Ellen Hume contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
