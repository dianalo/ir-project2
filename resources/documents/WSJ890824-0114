An AIDS patient at the National Institutes of Health began receiving the first infusions of the novel treatment, being developed by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco in collaboration with researchers at the National Cancer Institute, a unit of NIH.    The drug uses a synthetic copy of the protein CD4, which forms the binding site used by the AIDS virus when it attacks human cells. CD4 is stitched to an all-purpose human antibody, called immunoglobulin-G, or IgG, to form what scientists call a fusion protein or &quot;chimera&quot; -- a reference to the mythological beast that was part lion and part goat.    Synthetic CD4 was created on the theory that it could act as a false target for the AIDS virus, attracting and binding the virus so it cannot infect human cells -- a feat it successfully performed in the test tube. But so far human tests of the drug, while safe, haven't brought about any clear improvement in patients' health.    Now, scientists hope that by linking CD4 and IgG, they can both sop up the virus and spark immune defenses against it. Researchers also hope to overcome the problem of CD4's short half-life in the blood stream.    &quot;Because IgG stays in the body longer than CD4 alone, we hope to attain higher blood levels of the drug and give it less frequently,&quot; said Robert Yarchoan, the cancer institute reseacher who administered the first dose. &quot;There's also the hope that IgG can contribute to an immunologic defense,&quot; he added.    Dr. Yarchoan said about 15 patients will get the new drug at NIH and about 50 patients will participate in a multicenter study that includes the University of Washington, Seattle; Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.; New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston and San Francisco General Hospital.    The first phase of the study will weigh the safety of combined CD4-IgG. Potential risks, scientists say, include the possibility that patients could develop antibodies against the drug, curbing its effectiveness or provoking toxic reactions. A second risk is that the agent could stick to human antibodies, forming clumps called &quot;immune complexes&quot; that get stuck in human organs causing respiratory distress or kidney ailments.    &quot;All the drugs we use in AIDS today must be treated with respect,&quot; said Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute. &quot;But what is really exciting is that we've launched the age of designer antibodies in human disease. By taking the AIDS virus binding site, stitching it to the backbone of IgG, you've created an antibody that never existed in nature before.&quot;    Earlier this week, Genentech said it raised $72 million in a limited partnership to fund the development of CD4 products. Genentech Limited Partners IV is the largest such partnership in the biotechnology company's history.    According to Stephen A. Sherwin, vice president of clinical research, this shows that &quot;Genentech is 100% committed to the development of a CD4-based product against AIDS. We've even committed ourselves to a second-generation product before the first generation is completed. We think this will be an important product.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
