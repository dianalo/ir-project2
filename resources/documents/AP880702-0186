World oil prices have fallen sharply of late amid signs thatoil-exporting countries are producing faster than market demand canabsorb.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil, widely used as an overallgauge of the trend in oil prices, dropped below $15 a barrel Fridayto its lowest level since 1986.   That news, together with some rainfall at last in the parchedFarm Belt, has encouraged talk in the financial markets thatinflation might not be as bad as had been feared in the second halfof 1988.   One of the most reliable barometers of inflationaryexpectations, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, has fallen froma peak of nearly 9.5 percent several weeks ago to less than 9percent in recent days.   The drought watch continues on Wall Street, of course, even asit does in the areas of the country that suffer most directly fromthe lack of moisture.   While the current weather charts showed rain in the Midwest thispast week, traders in the futures and financial markets switchedtheir attention to forecasts suggesting more unusually dryconditions in the next few weeks.   For the national economy, however, many analysts say it isnecessary to keep the role of agricultural commodities inperspective.   ``Although the drought could be the worst in nearly a century,it should be kept in mind that the importance of raw foodcommodities has changed dramatically over the years, and the impactof sharp price rises in this area is not particularly great onconsumer spending or the inflation indices,'' said Michael Sherman,analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   David A. Levy and S. Jay Levy, a Chappaqua, N.Y., economicforecasting team, say they have no desire the minimize the distressthe drought is causing for farmers and other businesses inagricultural areas.   However, they add, ``the drought will indeed increase the pricesof many foods but have limited impact on inflation. Food andbeverages account for less than 18 percent of the Consumer PriceIndex.''   Furthermore, they add, rising food prices actually can serve todepress prices of many non-food items.   ``As food prices accelerate this year, non-food stores,especially those competing for consumers' discretionary income,will lose some sales. Price-cutting will be more frequent.   ``This deflationary effect will substantially reduce the overallimpact of the drought on the CPI to about half a percent.''   Despite such assurances, the stock market's early-summer rallybogged down in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30industrials slipped 11.38 to 2,131.58, ending a five-week winningstreak.   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped .88 to153.68; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter marketrose 3.08 to 394.70, and the American Stock Exchange market valueindex was up .51 at 309.00.   Volume on the Big Board averaged 208.42 million shares a day,against 170.99 million the week before.   Like the drought, the decline in the price of oil is cause forserious concern in some already beleaguered areas of the country.   But unlike the dry weather, cheaper oil can be seen as adistinct plus for such broad economic forces as nationwide consumerspending.   ``This recent drop in oil prices reminds us of the drop back inearly 1986 when the Dow Jones industrials were rallying and hadmoved above 1,700,'' said Jay Donnaruma, an analyst at First AlbanyCorp. in Albany, N.Y.   ``At that time no one liked the rally and everyone was lookingfor a correction. We get the same feeling now.   ``Can the rally in stocks, bonds and the dollar all be relatedto the drop in crude oil prices? Probably not entirely _ but forour money, watching the price of oil is better than watching thestars.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions July 2-3</NOTE></DOC>
