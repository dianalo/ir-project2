(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man convicted of masterminding a fakeplane crash during a heavy snowstorm has been sentenced to one yearin a federal prison and ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation.   The sentence given Monday to Mark Blair ``sends a strong messagethat it's a serious crime to cry wolf,'' said U.S. Attorney RichardWiebusch.   The radio report sparked a search last Jan. 8 that cost $50,000and involved as many as 100 people, 20 aircraft and six policeagencies. They looked for a downed jet with three dead passengersand a badly injured pilot.   U.S. Circuit Judge Hugh Bownes said ``more than minimal planningwas involved'' in faking the crash during the storm, in whichvisibility was one-half mile, temperatures were in the teens andnine inches of snow fell.   Blair ``must have known that (the fake report) would set off amassive ground and air search,'' Bownes said.   Blair, 29, was convicted in May of making a false report to thegovernment, a crime punishable by a fine and up to five years'prison.   Although Blair said he was not surprised by the sentence, heinsisted he is innocent and will appeal. Bownes declined to setbail for Blair pending appeal.   At the trial, Blair testified that he couldn't have committedthe hoax because he was asleep and wasn't aware a plane had beenreported down.   But one of his neighbors testified that he heard the sound of atwo-way radio through Blair's window and a voice crying out forhelp.   David Webster, a Navy reservist and Delta Airlines pilot,testified that he and his crew tracked the voice of a man whotalked sporadically and said that he was loosing blood, was chilledand weak, and that at least one person in his plane was dead.   Webster, 39, testified that his crew was overcome with emotionwhen the man said he heard the Navy plane overhead.   ``People in my plane were screaming and yelling .... I got tearsin my eyes thinking, `We're going to get this guy out,''' Webstersaid.   Bownes recommended that Blair be jailed at the FederalCorrectional Institution in Butner, N.C., a prison with extensivepsychiatric facilities.   Blair also was sentenced to two years' probation, during whichhe will be required to receive mental health counseling.</TEXT></DOC>
