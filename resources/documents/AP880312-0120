Scientists attending the task force's three-day internationalsymposium here agreed that new projections from developingcountries show that the birthrate should stop growing nearly a halfcentury earlier than demographers previously thought possible.   That would be followed by the stabilization of the entirepopulation, said Foege, an epidemiologist who conducted thebirthrate study. The birthrate is the number of births per 1,000population.   Dr. Kenneth Warren, a vaccines expert and head of the healthunit of the Rockefeller Foundation, said: ``People have consideredthat world population growth would continue indefinitely. Thequestion has been, is man going to overrun and destroy the wholeplanet? It's something people have been despairing about.''   The Task Force for Child Survival is a coalition that includesUNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, the World Health Organization,more than a dozen international aid agencies and doctors and healthministers from 11 developing countries.   The organizations have been working on an international campaignto immunize children against polio, diphtheria, tuberculosis andother diseases in a project aimed primarily at developing nations.   The common perception that low infant mortality causespopulation increases is apparently incorrect, said Warren.   Actually, a low death rate for infants actually causespopulations to stabilize. Industrialized countries such as theUnited States have relatively low birthrates.   Experts at the conference said Asian and Latin Americancountries now are following this trend. An increasing number ofcountries are weighing in with lower birth rates.   The experts said women in poor countries are likely to havelarger families to offset the loss of children to disease.   Foege, using data from the World Bank, examined trends in infantmortality and birthrates from 1960 to the present and projectedinfant mortality by nation through 2000.   ``If we're wrong, we're only wrong by a few years, the conceptisn't wrong,'' Foege said, adding that his predictions of theanticipated drop int he birthrate could have an error margin offive years.   Previous predictions have indicated that the birthrate wouldstabilize midway through the next century, when the populationreaches about 13 billion.   If Foege's projections are correct, the population would stopgrowing at about the year 2150.   Because of increased life expectancy and other factors, thepopulation level will take at least several decades to level offafter the birthrate stops growing.   ``There's full agreement on the prediction,'' said James P.Grant, executive director of UNICEF. ``With the kinds ofimprovements in survival we've been talking about at this meeting,the decline could come even sooner.''   The birthrate prediction made at on the last day of thesymposium was part of an optimistic appraisal of the progress madein improving health care and the potential to extend life forchildren worldwide.</TEXT></DOC>
