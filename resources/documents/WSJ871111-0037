Hisham M. Nazer, the kingdom oil minister, told the American Petroleum Institute's meeting here that this price -- the current bench mark for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- is the best one to promote stability in the oil industry and to maintain OPEC's share of world oil markets.    In his first oil-policy speech in the U.S., and in later comments, Mr. Nazer again ruled out any possibility of Saudi Arabia reverting to its former role of &quot;swing&quot; producer, in which it alone adjusted production according to demand for OPEC oil. &quot;Saudi Arabia is not going to assume the role of the planner or the guardian of the world oil market,&quot; he said. And Mr. Nazer called on non-OPEC oil producers to cooperate with OPEC in maintaining balanced supplies and stable oil prices.    &quot;These other oil-exporting countries have a responsibility to behave reasonably, in respect of both their oil prices and production policies, if they wish to avoid a return of 1986 or something worse,&quot; he said.    Last year, oil prices collapsed to $10 a barrel as OPEC fought for market share.    &quot;After all,&quot; Mr. Nazer said yesterday, &quot;the experience of 1986 clearly demonstrated that the ultimate survivor in a wayward oil market would surely be Saudi Arabia.&quot;    Although prices of U.S. crude-oil futures rose for the first time in 10 sessions on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday -- up 31 cents to $18.94 a barrel for December delivery -- few analysts and traders expect Mr. Nazer's comments to spur a rally.    Mr. Nazer's comments come at a time of heavy anticipation in the oil markets over the outcome of OPEC's winter meeting in Vienna next month. As the leading producer in OPEC, Saudi Arabia has the loudest voice in the organization, and its views toward pricing and production will be the most important factor in any decision over pricing and production policies.    Without Saudi Arabia's support, however, a price increase is unlikely. But it is understood that the kingdom will agree to an increase in OPEC's official production ceiling, currently 16.6 million barrels a day, to 17.5 million barrels a day, the expected level of demand for OPEC oil next year. That would be based on Iraq accepting a quota of 2.4 million barrels a day -- a ceiling equal to that of Iran -- and is subject to agreement by the Iranians.    Iraq, which refuses to accept or abide by its current 1.5 million barrel-a-day quota, has asked for an allocation equal to that of its war foe.    If all OPEC members honored their quotas, a ceiling of 17.5 million barrels a day would actually reduce OPEC's production from the current level, which exceeds 18 million barrels a day. That's largely because Iraq would be cut back from current ouput of 2.7 million barrels a day.    Saudi Arabia, however, won't reduce its production. Mr. Nazer made clear that the kingdom will continue to produce as much as its quota of 4.3 million barrels a day. And he emphasized that it won't budge from its pricing position.    &quot;This seems the most appropriate way to regain for OPEC members as a whole a share of world oil trade consistent with their installed production capacity and comparatively large oil reserves,&quot; Mr. Nazer said. &quot;An $18 oil price should also provide a satisfactory basis for resolving structural problems in the world economy and permit it to grow at more than 3% annually over the next few years.&quot;    Citing the huge oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries, Mr. Nazer said that sooner or later, increases in world oil demand will have to be met largely by these six OPEC-member states and by Mexico. &quot;Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are pre-eminent, on account of their very large base of remaining proved reserves relative to production volumes in recent years,&quot; Mr. Nazer said. &quot;We shall seek to increase production at a price in the region of $18 a barrel for some time to come.&quot;    Mr. Nazer also took note of Saudi Arabia's reorganization plan for its oil industry. Although he didn't go into specifics, it is understood that the Arabian American Oil Co., which has been chiefly responsible for production of the kingdom's crude oil, would have an expanded role in the restructured industry.    Also, Mr. Nazer reiterated that Saudi Arabia is seeking &quot;downstream,&quot; or refining and marketing, investments outside the kingdom. &quot;We now have a considerable experience in joint-venture developments in changing market conditions,&quot; he said. &quot;We envisage further enterprises involving our existing partners, and perhaps new ones, in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
