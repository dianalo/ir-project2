The December-delivery metal ended at $1.28 a pound, for a loss of 1.90 cents. At one point, the December contract showed a loss of 4.15 cents.    Demand from commodity funds that follow computer-generated signals provided most of the late support, according to William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. The funds were thought to be the buying back of contracts that had been sold short.    Peruvian miners, who are on strike, expect their case to go to the Peruvian Supreme Court in a week or 10 days, according to Mr. O'Neill.    The head of the mining federation, Alfredo Silva, said he believed the Supreme Court was likely to reaffirm a lower court ruling that the government had to negotiate with the federation on a nationwide basis and not mine by mine, which would be a violation of the miners' collective bargaining rights, Mr. O'Neill said.    Mr. Silva also said he didn't expect the government to appeal such a verdict, according to Mr. O'Neill.    &quot;This is creating a face-saving type of situation in which the government could claim it has to negotiate with the miners and could serve as a vehicle to start the talks,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said.    Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, had a more mixed picture of the developments in Peru.    &quot;One union leader said he expected the strike to end in week or two and that the miners would get what they're asking for,&quot; said Ms. Raptopoulos. Others in Peru thought the strike would end even sooner, she said.    &quot;On the other hand, there were also reports that miners had marched on the Ministry of Labor in Lima and an estimated 300 of them had thrown rocks at the ministry and demanded the minister's resignation,&quot; she said.    Ms. Raptopoulos added that 20 miners had been arrested and that 80 others are going on a hunger strike beginning today.    &quot;I suspect that the strike will end in a week or two because of the significant loss of revenue the country is experiencing from the strike and the loss of income to the miners,&quot; Ms. Raptopoulos said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed as gold, silver and platinum each moved in its own direction. December gold was unchanged at $425.60 an ounce. December silver declined 9.3 cents an ounce at $6.30. January platinum rose $2.20 an ounce to $580.40. Precious metals appeared to ignore the improvement in the trade deficit in September, and in particular the inflationary implications of record exports, an analyst said. Weakness in oil and the dollar also were depressing factors but the main reason for a lack of direction in precious metals is the slowdown in demand for gold bullion, particularly in the Far East, he said.    ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices eased. The November-delivery contract ended 2.70 cents a pound lower at $1.7960. Concern about tight supplies of the concentrate that provided support for the market this year should be alleviated in 1989 by increased Florida output and flat demand, said Judy Ganes, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. U.S. consumption has leveled off because of high prices, although there has been increased competition at the retail level, she said. In Europe, she added, importers overbought when there was increasing concern about supplies and now are well-inventoried for the near future, at least, according to Ms. Ganes.    ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices eased. The December delivery was off 23 cents a barrel to $13.67. The softer tone was attributed to a news wire report that said members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are producing crude oil at the rate of 22.5 million barrels a day, an analyst said. This is a 10-year high and well above the official OPEC quota of 16.5 million barrels. It is also above estimated world demand of 19 million barrels a day, he said. The Indonesian oil minister was reported as saying that Iran said it would agree for Iraq to have a production quota equal to that of Iran's, the analyst said. Iraq doesn't have a quota currently, but Iran's quota is 2.6 million barrels a day and it is said to be producing at the rate of 2.7 million barrels daily. Traders were focusing on talks by OPEC price and strategy committees that are to begin today in Vienna. These are preliminary talks at which such matters as production cuts, quotas and prices will be dealt with before being fully discussed by all OPEC members Monday in Vienna. -   STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices fell sharply on continued weakness in the dollar and lower bond futures prices. Comments in Washington from Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, that the U.S. can't &quot;grow&quot; its way out of the budget deficit also pushed financial markets lower, traders said. An exception were most foreign currency futures, which rose sharply in price in reaction to the lower dollar. &quot;Money managers are saying that with the dollar below 123 yen U.S. stocks have little value to foreign owners,&quot; said Gerald Walsh, a futures analyst with Refco Group Ltd. in New York. At midafternoon the dollar was quoted at 122.45 Japanese yen in New York cash market trading. Falling bond futures prices near their close of trading at 3 p.m. EST quashed a rally attempt in stocks and stock futures. The December Treasury bond futures contract fell 13/16 to close at 88 5/32. Traders said that the 88 1/2 level was an important technical support level for bond futures. Once that level was breached, traders following such technical guidelines sold futures contracts that they had purchased at higher prices to avoid further losses. Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures for settlement in December fell 4.45 to close at 265.05. </TEXT></DOC>
