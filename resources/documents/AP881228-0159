U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on Friday had ruled thatindependent prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh must be given a 162-pageoutline of possible testimony in the trial of the former NationalSecurity Council aide.   Gesell had said the material must be turned over by Jan. 3.   North's attorneys asked Gesell on Wednesday to stay the orderuntil an appeal or other court action can be filed.   North's lawyers have argued that turning over the outline wouldreveal their trial strategy and violate North's constitutionalrights.   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman in Walsh's office, said no courthearing had yet been scheduled and her office had no immediateresponse to the motion.   Gesell last week set a Jan. 31 trial date for North, who ischarged with conspiring with former national security adviser JohnPoindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.Gen. Richard Secord to illegally divert more than $12 million inU.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   The four are to be tried separately, with North's trial scheduledfirst.</TEXT></DOC>
