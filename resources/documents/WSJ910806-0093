The New Salt Lake Arena, an $86 million project undertakenas a joint venture by a Japanese-owned contractor, wasstarted in June 1990 and is expected to be completed inOctober. That would be nearly a year less than projectsupervisors figure it would have taken a conventional firm.</LP><TEXT>   One reason: Ohbayashi America Corp., a unit of Tokyo-basedObayashi Corp., is using a new technique by which the arena'ssprawling roof could be quickly slid into place rather thanset up by crane in individual trusses.   The arena project stands as a harbinger of change for theU.S. construction industry, which lags woefully behind Japanand some other countries in conducting research anddevelopment and then putting new technology into practice.Awakening to the threat, U.S. contractors are trying to catchup. But many industry experts warn that the U.S. industry maysoon be overtaken by the Japan-led competition, much as theautomobile and steel industries were in recent decades.   &quot;We will see them creeping in gradually but surely,&quot; saidRichard L. Tucker, director of the Construction IndustryInstitute, a private think tank in Austin, Texas, that ispushing for more U.S. research. &quot;I think it will happenbefore the turn of the century.&quot;   The technological threat could hardly come at a worse timefor the U.S. construction industry, which is mired in a deepslump precipitated by massive overbuilding in the 1980s.There is as much as a 10-year oversupply of office buildingsin some cities.   Largely because of other factors, including decreased U.S.investment abroad and weakening of the dollar, market shareof U.S. contractors is already slipping significantly.Foreign-owned firms (primarily from Japan and Europe)controlled 6% of U.S. building contracts in 1989, comparedwith about 2% in 1982; meanwhile, the U.S. share of majorconstruction contracts world-wide fell to 25% in 1988 from50% in 1980.   U.S. companies' share of contracts outside the countryslipped to 34% in 1989 from 37% in 1982, while the collectiveshare of the five biggest competing countries rose to 52.5%from 38.5%, according to a report for the ConstructionIndustry Institute. The report showed Japan's share ofcontracts outside its own country rising to 11.5% from 8%.   On their home turf, Japanese contractors have been doggedby allegations of bid-rigging. But recently Japan avoidedthreatened U.S. sanctions by assuring U.S. companies of morebusiness in the Japanese public works market over the nextfew years. The U.S. and Japan identified 23 additionalJapanese public-works projects that will be open to U.S.participation as part of a bilateral agreement that wassigned last week.   Technological superiority by Japan is expected to play akey role in the shrinking of the U.S. market share,considering the huge gap in spending on research. Japanesebuilders, who generate around $500 billion annually, spendabout $2 billion on research. That compares with $50 millionby U.S. contractors, who generate about $400 billion a year,Mr. Tucker said.   U.S. contractors are largely mired in decades-oldpractices fostered by a competitive-bid process that criticssay discourages innovation and emphasizes cost over quality.In Japan, however, technology has been part of the buildingculture since World War II and is promoted by government andindustry alike.   As a result, Japanese contractors are considered worldleaders in civil engineering and have come up with suchfuturistic developments as construction robots. They havealso mastered techniques for tunneling and invented devicesthat safely separate a building from its foundation in caseof earthquake.   The technological advances have enabled the Japanese tocut costs by shortening time of construction. Kajima Corp.,for instance, said it developed a robot, nicknamed&quot;Mighty-Hand,&quot; with which two workers can install a precastconcrete wall panel in less than 20 minutes -- compared withabout an hour when installed conventionally by &quot;at least&quot;four workers.   By using a new computer-controlled paving machine, Kajima,which is based in Tokyo, said it also completed in 10 monthsthe construction of a six-mile automobile test track forNissan Group. The track, built three years ago outsidePhoenix, Ariz., would have taken as long as 18 months tobuild using conventional methods, said Koji Hayashi,executive vice president of Kajima Engineering andamp; ConstructionInc., a Kajima unit based in Los Angeles.   Last year, Obayashi announced plans for a mile-highskyscraper in Tokyo that would be built by robots, requiringas little as 10% of the conventional work force. Besidessaving time and money, Chesley D. Smiley, senior vicepresident of Ohbayashi America, said construction robots aresolving Japan's problem of shortages in the skilled buildingtrades.   Japan is experiencing no dearth of research personnel,however. While Japan's top 30 Japanese contractors havein-house research units, &quot;maybe&quot; five are so equipped in theU.S., said C. William Ibbs, associate professor of civilengineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Thetypical Japanese research arm employs as many as 300 workers,whereas in the U.S. it may consist of only a half-dozenpeople, Mr. Tucker said.   The U.S. is considered superior to Japan in its level ofuniversity research, but even in this area Japan and otherU.S. competitors benefit, because they are major contributorsto the research programs. Stanford University's Center forIntegrated Facilities Engineering, for example, has 42members; 40% come from foreign countries, including Japan,Taiwan, Holland, France, Finland and Spain.   Moreover, a consortium of eight universities called theCalifornia Universities for Research in EarthquakeEngineering has received a pledge of $2.1 million in cashover the next three years and $1.7 million of in-kindservices from Kajima USA, a unit of Kajima Corp., Mr. Ibbssaid. By contrast, he said, U.S. company participation hasbeen limited to a few $5,000 grants from consultingengineers.   Outspent as they are, U.S. contractors are starting torespond to the research threat. Two teams of Americans fromthe Civil Engineering Research Foundation, a research arm ofthe American Society of Civil Engineers, and the JapaneseTechnology Evaluation Center at Loyola College in Maryland,recently traveled to Japan to study the research facilitiesand develop recommendations. They came back sounding thealarm for immediate action.   U.S. contractors' &quot;very competitiveness and survival willbe threatened by the Japanese and other overseas firms ifchange is not brought about,&quot; trip participant Harold T.Glaser, a vice president of James M. Montgomery ConsultingEngineers Inc., warned afterward.   The Construction Industry Institute, which prohibitsforeign membership, was created about 10 years ago to promotemore research and development in U.S. construction. So far,Mr. Tucker said, it has raised about $3 million of the $500million he estimates is needed to compete technologically.   A handful of U.S. contractors, including Bechtel GroupInc., San Francisco, and Fluor Daniel Inc., a unit of FluorCorp., use research in their construction projects. &quot;Emphasison quality management is ingrained in our culture for peopleto continually find better ways to work,&quot; said Deborah Land,a spokeswoman for Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif.   Charles Pankow Builders, Ltd., Altadena, Calif., uses aconcept known as &quot;design/build&quot; by which the contractorparticipates in the planning and building process rather thanjust building from someone else's plans as many other U.S.contractors do. &quot;The design/build system brings together eachmember of the project team during the earliest stages ofdesign, which can result in extraordinary savings of time andmoney for owners,&quot; said Dean Stephan, executive vicepresident of Pankow Corp., general partner of PankowBuilders.   While other U.S. builders scurry to play catch-up, theirJapanese counterparts are planning for the next century.Engineers at Obayashi, for instance, have designed a &quot;lunarcity&quot; and a habitat for Mars. The company's 1990 annualreport asserts, &quot;When platforms, laboratories and solarenergy-generating satellites are constructed in space,Obayashi will be there.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
