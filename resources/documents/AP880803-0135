The exception to China's ``one-family, one-child'' policy wasannounced Wednesday by a family planning official. ``They want boysand they are not abiding by the original policy so we changed it,''he said of the peasants.   The new policy, which will not apply to city dwellers, wascriticized by a United Nations official who said the governmentshould encourage rural families to regard the two sexes equallyrather than bend to their prejudices.   Li Yong, a spokesman for the State Birth Control Commission,described the new rule in an interview with The Associated Press.His remarks were the first official confirmation of the new policywhich amounts to a relaxation of China's rules which prohibitfamilies from having more than one child.   The first word of the new policy appeared Tuesday in thePeople's Daily, which reported it had been instituted in Shandongprovince.   Li said the state will now give peasants ``in almost everyprovince'' the freedom to have a second child if their first was agirl. About 80 percent of China's 1.07 billion people are peasants.   Li said families would only be permitted to have one extrachild. ``After that they will be subject to the same fines aseverybody else,'' he said.   Fines for having too many children generally amount to $270 ormore per year for five years _ about twice the average rural income.   The head of Beijing's office of the United Nations Fund forPopulation Activities said the change was unusual because Chinarecently took steps to enforce the one child policy. ``This changecertainly is not in line with the modern feeling that children ofboth sexes are equal,'' said Manfred Kulessa.   Refusal on the part of the peasants to bow to the one-childlimit prompted the government to loosen its regulations, Li said.The peasants' belief that boys were economically more productivethan girls and Chinese superstitions favoring male children weremain reasons they fought the policy, he said.   Li said the change would not greatly affect China's populationbecause only 19 percent of its families have one child. Nor wouldit affect the ratio of men to women, he said.   ``Our real problems are with the families that have three, fiveand even seven children,'' he said. ``We need to concentrate onthose now.'' Li said no relaxation was planned for the stringentone-child policy in the cities.   Superstition has made it difficult for government officials toconvince peasants that daughters were as good as sons, Li said,citing a popular Chinese proverb, ``more sons, more happiness.''   ``This has become especially true in a dragon year,'' he said.Chinese mythology says it is good to have children, especiallyboys, in a dragon year.   Recent economic reforms have also created a desire for sons, hesaid.   During the last decade, peasants have returned to farming theirown plots of land. Because the plots are too small formechanization, peasants need more hands to do the work. ``Girlscannot do physical labor as well as boys, naturally a boy is moredesirable,'' he said.   In addition, most peasants are not covered by any sort of apension, so they want to have sons to support them when the getold. ``When a girl gets married she leaves home,'' he said. ``Boysstay on and support the old folks.''   Li acknowledged that an increasing number of girls have beenabandoned by parents who want sons.   After years of pushing big families, China began attempts tolimit its population with the onset of Western-oriented economicreforms in 1978.   But the going has been rough. Apart from the economic reformswhich encourage big families in the countryside, a generation bornduring a baby boom in the 1960s has reached child-bearing age.   As a result, China is in the middle of another baby boom thathas seen the population growth rate jump from 1.1 percent in 1985to 1.4 percent in 1987. If the growth rate continues Chinapopulation could swell to 1.5 billion by 2010.   China attacked this problem in February when it announcedstringent measures to control growth, linking the salaries of localfamily planning officials to the population growth rate of theirarea.</TEXT></DOC>
