Robert Salsbury, 28 years old, admitted to Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges of using inside information given to him by Michael David, formerly a lawyer at the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison. Mr. David has agreed to pay as much as $150,000 to settle civil charges related to the scheme; he is awaiting sentencing on four criminal counts.    Mr. Salsbury wasn't accused of making any money with the information and won't pay any fine.    SEC court papers said Mr. Salsbury's only apparent benefit from the Yuppie Five scheme was that &quot;his reputation and credibility were enhanced with business associates and friends with whom he shared the lawyer's information. . . .&quot; Mr. Salsbury has said in court that his superiors knew about the inside information, but Drexel denies that claim.    Besides being barred from the industry for three years, Mr. Salsbury agreed that he wouldn't violate the anti-fraud provisions of federal securities laws, as he admitted he had done. The settlement was filed in U.S. district court here this week.    Mr. Salsbury in December was sentenced to three years' probation and community service in the related criminal case. A total of four young Wall Street professionals and one investor have pleaded guilty; only Messrs. Salsbury and David have been charged by the SEC.    The case, the government says, is unrelated to the Dennis Levine or Ivan Boesky cases.    Mr. Salsbury was a research analyst in Drexel's domestic arbitrage department from October 1985 to March 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
