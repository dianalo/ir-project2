The ethnic Karen guerrillas first attacked the camps nearMethawaw, about 130 miles northeast of Rangoon, on Sept. 26. Sincethen, they have killed 35 government soldiers, including oneofficer, and wounded 95, said government spokesman Kyaw Sann. Threeothers were missing, he said.   Rebel casualties were believed heavy, but a count was notpossible because the guerrillas dragged away their dead andwounded, Kyaw Sann said.   Methawaw is on the west bank of the Moei River, which forms theborder between Burma and Thailand.   The Karens, who are fighting for the autonomy of an area alongthe border, form the strongest of Burma's dozen insurgencies.Karens represent about 2 million of Burma's 38 million people.   Kyaw Sann said about 1,000 guerrillas were involved in theattacks near Methawaw. The guerrillas said they recaptured severalhills Wednesday in an area government forces had seized more thanfour years ago.   Kyaw Sann said government troops also attacked two other Karenstrongholds, at Maela on Oct. 9 and at Wangkha on Oct. 13. Sevensoldiers were killed and 24 were injured, and fierce fightingcontinued at Wangkha on Monday, he said.   Kyaw Sann also said students who recently fled to the borderareas to join the guerrillas must return by Nov. 18 or they will beregarded as rebels. He said the government has established``reception centers'' at 27 towns in areas bordering Bangladesh,India, China, and Thailand.   ``The government regarded these students as youths misled andgone astray,'' he said. ``They will be welcomed at receptioncenters where they will be well looked after before sending themback to their respective homes. We will have to regard them asrebels after the deadline of Nov. 18.''   Officials of various rebel groups say more than 9,000 studentsand other civilians have arrived at rebel camps since militarycommander Gen. Saw Maung seized power in Rangoon Sept. 18 andcrushed pro-democracy demonstrations in the cities.   Radio Rangoon announced that two more political partiesregistered Monday, bringing to 20 the number formed after SawMaung's coup.   The two parties, the Peoples Volunteer Organization and theDemocratic Progressive Allies Party, have elderly leaders who werepolitically active before Burma achieved its independence in 1948.</TEXT></DOC>
