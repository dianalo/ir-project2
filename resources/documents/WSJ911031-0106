September's inflow into bond funds was the heftiest sinceMarch 1987, helping to put bond funds on track for their bestannual sales since 1986.</LP><TEXT>   So far this year, bond funds have pulled in $47.2 billionmore than they surrendered to departing shareholders. Thisyear's huge bond fund inflows have been driven by the sharpdiscrepancy between money fund yields, now at just above 5%,and the yields of 7% and more that are still available onmany bond funds.   But during this month, there was a sales slowdown at someof the big no-load fund groups, which sell their fundsdirectly to the public and typically charge little or nothingin the way of sales commissions.   Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Associates, Scudder,Stevens andamp; Clark, and Vanguard Group say that although bondfund inflows have been strong this month, they haven'tmatched September's rapid sales rate.   &quot;It's a slight slowdown from an out-of-this-world pace,&quot;says Gavin Quill, a Scudder marketing research analyst.   Although sales are slowing at some no-load fund companies,business remains brisk for those bond funds that aredistributed through brokers, financial planners and insuranceagents. Broker-sold fund groups, such as OppenheimerManagement, Marsh andamp; McLennan's Putnam, PaineWebber Group,American Express's Shearson Lehman Brothers and TNE FundGroup, say that this month's bond fund inflows were as goodas -- or better than -- September's inflows.   &quot;We're having an unbelievable sales month across theboard,&quot; says Bruce Speca, a senior vice president with TNEFund Group, a unit of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co.&quot;People are definitely looking for yield. I think, when welook back a year from now, we'll see this month as thebeginning of a string of record sales months.&quot;   At PaineWebber, money has continued to pour into thebrokerage firm's short-term global bond fund and its U.S.government bond fund. &quot;The price has been paid by the moneymarket funds,&quot; says Joyce Fensterstock, president ofPaineWebber Mutual Funds.   Municipal bond funds and global bond funds have been thebiggest money magnets during this year's bond fund buyingbinge. Funds that buy Treasury and Government NationalMortgage Association bonds have also been big winners. Butthe funds paying the fattest dividend checks -- those thatinvest in high-yielding junk bonds -- have pulled inrelatively paltry sums this year.   According to the Investment Company Institute, September's$7.9 billion inflow was slightly above August's level, whenbond funds attracted just under $7 billion. (These figuresinclude bond fund sales less redemptions, plus the net resultof exchanges between bond funds and other funds in the samefund company. Reinvested dividends are excluded.)   Stock funds also saw a pickup in sales during September.Stock funds attracted $3.1 billion last month, up from $2.8billion in August. Many fund groups say that October's stockfund inflows were at or above last month's levels.   At Fidelity, the country's biggest fund group, stock fundshad their largest monthly inflows since February. &quot;Sales ofthe more conservative {stock} funds are very strong,&quot; reportsMichael Hines, a Fidelity marketing vice president.   &quot;Aggressive growth&quot; funds specializing in small-companystocks have been sizzling performers this year. But so farthis year, aggressive growth funds haven't attracted nearlyas much money as the more conservative stock funds that buylarger company stocks.   Stock fund sales are likely to remain buoyant in themonths ahead, according to a study conducted for Fidelity bythe University of Michigan Survey Research Center. The studyfound that 41% of mutual fund owners plan to invest in astock fund over the next three months, up from 33% inSeptember.   The amount of cash held by stock mutual fund managers roseslightly during September, but it is still at historicallylow levels. In August, cash as a percentage of stock fundassets plunged to 8%, the lowest level since January 1984.But during September, stock fund managers didn't spend allthe cash that they pulled in from new investors, so that cashlevels increased slightly, to 8.2%.
