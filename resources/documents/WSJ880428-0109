The state's department of finance said that shortage could devour most of Gov. George Deukmejian's $1 billion reserve fund for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30.    Moreover, the lower revenue will force the administration and legislators to overhaul the governor's proposed $44.3 billion budget for the next fiscal year, which had assumed that the $1 billion reserve fund would be available at the start of the year.    Fiscal experts attributed the shortage to the administration's overly optimistic estimate of how much Californians would pay in capital-gains taxes on security sales triggered by the October stock-market crash.    The state derives about half its $33 billion general fund budget from personal income taxes. </TEXT></DOC>
