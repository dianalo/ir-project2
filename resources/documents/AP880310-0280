The settlement, one of the largest ever in a defense contractingcase, grew out of findings by Pentagon auditors of numerousaccounting and inventory irregularities at the Fort Worth, Texas,company, Pentagon sources said Wednesday night.   Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman, today confirmed a settlementhad been reached and was scheduled to be signed on Friday. Acompany statement said, ``We believe a settlement is in theoffing.''   ``The Army is fully satisfied with this settlement and believesit has recovered every dime out of this that we can get,'' saidSoucy.   The Pentagon sources said that in reaching the settlement,federal prosecutors had agreed to drop any potential criminal orcivil charges and that Bell Helicopter would not acknowledge anywrongdoing.   Soucy agreed there would be no further prosecution in the case,but said the government had always hoped to strike a reasonablesettlement rather than go to trial because of the case's complexity.   ``This was a very complex case that turned on a bad accountingsystem (at Bell Helicopter) that was used in connection withcontracts worth billions of dollars,'' the spokesman said.   Reached late Wednesday, Carl Harris, a Bell Helicopterspokesman, read from a prepared statement which acknowledged therehad been ``settlement discussions.''   ``We believe a settlement is in the offing,'' the statementsaid. ``We are hopeful it will be soon. However, we are not able tocomment until a final agreement is reached. The terms that arecurrently under discussion will not have a material effect on BellHelicopter Textron in 1988.''   According to Soucy, the settlement will require Bell Helicopterto pay $69 million directly to the U.S. Treasury within the next 30days. The company also will have to allow the Army to assumepossession of any or all of a spare parts inventory valued at about$11 million.   In addition, Bell will forego claims to about $6 million worthof interest on contract progress payments withheld by the Army andabout $1.5 million in legal fees. Offsetting that will be a $1.1million payment by the Army to Bell to cover a separate contractthat got sidelined in the dispute.   When a number of smaller provisions are added in, ``the finalvalue of this settlement is roughly $88 million,'' Soucy said.   The spokesman said most of the overcharges came as a result ofan accounting problem that dealt with the handling of contractsbetween 1983 and 1985. During the period, Bell switched to acomputerized accounting and inventory system that had the effect,among other things, of accelerating the company's requests for Armyprogress payments for work performed.   Bell agreed to implement a new accounting system that met theArmy's approval in October 1985.   The Defense Contract Audit Agency had originally identifiedabout $107 million in overcharges by Bell. Soucy said subsequentinvestigation ``uncovered a number of overlapping amounts andduplication in the books.''   The overcharges never amounted to $107 million, Soucy said, buthe declined to estimate how much they did total.   Soucy said the company had also agreed to implement a businessethics program for its employees and to acknowledge ``our right toaudit their books and documents.''   Bell Helicopter is a wholly owned subsidiary of Textron Inc., aconglomerate based in Providence, R.I. In fiscal 1987, the parentcompany ranked as the Pentagon's 18th largest contractor, with$1.55 billion in defense work.   Bell Helicopter holds contracts from the Army for such majorhelicopter programs as the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter, the UH-1Iroquois utility helicopter and the OH-58D Kiowa light helicopter.   A House committee is conducting its own investigation of thecase.</TEXT></DOC>
