Reagan administration officials contend that Japan has reaped enormous trade advantages by tapping freely into U.S. technology while keeping its own mostly to itself. The U.S. has been trying for months to reach a new accord that will redress that imbalance in the flow of commercially useful scientific information.    But disputes between the U.S. and Japanese negotiators are likely to prevent completion of a science and technology agreement to replace an existing accord that expires Jan. 31. Having failed to reach an agreement in time for Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's visit here last week, the closed-door talks resumed this week. However, Japan's opposition to U.S. demands are so stiff it would be a &quot;miracle&quot; if the accord can be completed before the old one expires on Jan. 31, says a U.S. negotiator.    If the talks collapse, the U.S. could retaliate. A little-known 1986 statute authored by Sen. Robert Dole (R., Kan.) and Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D., W.Va.) authorizes federal laboratories to close their doors to Japanese researchers if Japan doesn't accord similar privileges to U.S. scientists. There are about 7,000 Japanese scientists and researchers working in the U.S., compared with only 500 American scientists working in Japan, estimates Mitchel Wallerstein of the National Research Council, which represents corporate and university science interests.    One reason for the disparity is that the bulk of U.S. basic research is done in open, usually public institutions such as national laboratories and universities. But, notes Sen. Rockefeller, most of Japan's best research is government funded but channeled to corporations.    &quot;They've got the run of M.I.T. and Berkeley while our people can't get equal access to Japan's technology because most of its best stuff is in corporate laboratories,&quot; a U.S. official says.    To improve U.S. access to Japanese technology, the Japanese are being asked to publish more of their basic research in English, open up more research positions to Americans, and allow U.S. participation in product-development work financed by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. &quot;We don't have to define reciprocity in terms of the numbers of researchers in either country. We just want the principle recognized in the agreement,&quot; a U.S. negotiator says.    The Japanese government has promised to &quot;increase our scientific cooperation with the U.S,&quot; and during his visit Mr. Takeshita offered the National Science Foundation a grant of $4.4 million to finance more trips to Japanese research centers by American scientists.    But the U.S. wants a new scientific exchange agreement that addresses such issues as reciprocity, intellectual property rights and national security, while Japan prefers an accord that's as bland and toothless as the old one signed in 1980 by President Carter and the late Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira.    In the area of patent secrecy, the U.S. wants the Japanese to acknowledge compliance with a 1956 bilateral accord designed to protect defense-related technology. Tokyo contends its current policies provide such protection though it resists making a public commitment for fear of antagonizing leftist opposition groups.    The U.S. also wants assurances that Japan won't unfairly commercialize jointly developed technology. Japan's access to a number of major projects, including a multinational space station and a supercollider to advance high-energy physics research, could depend on its willingness to satisfy such concerns, U.S. officials say.    Charles Owens, a National Science Foundation official involved in scientific exchanges with Japan, contends that Tokyo is making a serious effort to open corporate labs to U.S. researchers. &quot;Our problem is finding American scientists who can read Japanese and handle the difficult cultural experience of working in Japan,&quot; he says.    U.S. scientists agree that language is an obstacle. But the problems go deeper. &quot;Openness to foreign researchers isn't natural to Japan,&quot; says Richard Samuels, a professor who directs the Japan program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;This has been true for 100 years.&quot;    Mr. Samuels worries that failure to reach an accord could interrupt important scientific cooperation. &quot;There's no worse way for the countries to go than to stoke the fires of techno-nationalism,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
