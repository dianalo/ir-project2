RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to awardnearly $3 million in attorneys' fees to Indian tribes who won alengthy court battle against Washington state officials overfishing rights.   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that struckdown the award on grounds a federal law reimbursing lawyers whorepresent the winning side in civil rights cases does not apply tothe Indians' lawsuit.   Twenty-one tribes sought to recapture legal fees awarded by afederal judge who then was overruled by the 9th U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals. The Indians were supported by 33 other tribes who saidtheir ability to vindicate treaty rights could be undermined ifthey are unable to recover legal fees won in court.   The case acted on today stems from a 1970 lawsuit in whichIndians asserted fishing rights in Washington state waters based ona treaty signed in 1885.   Indians relinquished land under the treaty in return forguarantees of fishing rights. The treaty said the Indians have the``right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations... in common with all citizens of the territory.''   Federal courts ultimately ruled the treaty entitled the tribesto approximately half the harvestable fish in state waters thatpassed through recognized tribal fishing areas. The Supreme Courtupheld those rights in 1979.   Years of litigation over legal fees followed, leading in 1985 toa federal judge's award of $2.95 million to the tribes to be paidby Washington state.   But the 9th Circuit court threw out the award last year.   The appeals court said the fishing rights case was not coveredby a 1976 federal law reimbursing the prevailing side's legalexpenses in civil rights lawsuits.   The appeals court said, in effect, that Washington stateofficials did not violate deliberately the Indians' rights bylimiting their fishing harvest. The case was a dispute over theintepretation of the treaty, the appeals court said.   ``It is not disputed that the Indians had rights under thetreaty,'' the appeals court said. ``Just exactly what those rightswere was unknown until the Supreme Court decision (in 1979.) If thestate of Washington violates these now known and well-delineatedrights, there would be an actual conflict between state and federallaw which might give rise'' to a federal civil rights lawsuit.   The appeals court added: ``That, however, has not yet happenedand is not the situation here.'' Therefore, there is no basis forthe award of legal fees, it said.   Indians said the ruling could be devastating to their efforts atenforcing treaty rights.   ``Cases to vindicate treaty rights affecting important resourcesof an area may take years to complete because of the extremesensitivity of the issues,''said a group of 33 tribes who supportedthe appeal by the Washigton tribes. ``Such cases are especiallydraining on normally scarce tribal resources.''   The case is Makah Tribe vs. State of Washington, 87-1390.</TEXT></DOC>
