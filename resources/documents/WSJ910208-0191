This growth spurt is transforming small metropolitan areasinto giants -- and leaving older cities sputtering. It'sconverting Naples, Fla., the nation's fastest-growingmetropolitan area, from a sleepy enclave on the edge offarmlands and the Everglades into a fast-growing commercialcenter. And it's changing the face of Florida, an agrarianbackwater and the smallest state in the South a half-centuryago, by turning it into a suburban sprawl.</LP><TEXT>   In all, nine of the nation's dozen fastest-growingmetropolitan areas are in Florida, all of them growing morethan four times as fast as the U.S. as a whole. Seven of the25 fastest-growing metropolitan areas are in California, withfour in Texas. No Eastern urban area in the fastest-growing25 is farther north than Jacksonville, N.C.   The result: Such places as Fort Pierce, Fort Myers, Ocalaand Melbourne, all small Florida communities only a decadeago, are emerging as substantial metropolitan areas withstunning speed. And such large centers as the Riverside-SanBernardino area in California, Las Vegas, Nev., Orlando,Fla., and the West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach sprawlin Florida are getting even bigger.   Much of the growth in this new generation of metropolitanareas can be attributed to the older generation of Americans,many of whom are retiring in these regions. &quot;A lot of theseplaces are new developments, sort of follow-ups to theinitial wave of `colonizing,'&quot; says Richard Forstall, chiefof the Census Bureau's population distribution branch.&quot;Hundreds of thousands of people are settling in moderatelypriced communities -- and they're making metropolitan placesout of places that didn't used to be metropolitan.&quot;   These figures, assembled by American Demographics magazinefrom 1990 Census data, are the raw materials of a marketingmap that clearly sets out an important path of economicgrowth.   &quot;People who retire to these places tend to have highdisposable incomes,&quot; says John Kasarda, an economicdemographer at the University of North Carolina BusinessSchool. &quot;If you move to Florida, you're probably not part ofthe underclass. These people have pensions and lots ofleisure -- so they spend money.&quot;   But there's no single explanation for the fast growth inplaces as different as Naples, Fla., which grew 77% in thepast decade; Las Vegas, which grew 60%; and Austin, Texas,which grew 46%. One is a retirement haven, another a gamblingand tourism center and the third the home of a massive stateuniversity, state government workers and a high-techindustry.   Even among the fast-growing communities of Florida, thereare different explanations for the population explosion.   &quot;This is not all the same kinds of growth,&quot; says CarolWest, director of economic forecasting at the University ofFlorida's business school. &quot;And whether this growth makesFlorida a big growth area for business depends critically onwhat you're supplying.&quot;   The Naples, Fort Myers and Bradenton areas are popularretirement destinations. Orlando's growth is being propelledby tourism, West Palm Beach's by a combination of the two.And as the cost of retiring on the coasts grows, so does theappeal of such inland settings as the Ocala area, where onlya decade ago horses roamed in large pastures.   This much is clear: Growth is transforming both thecharacter and economies of these areas. &quot;Growth provides asense of dynamism to a community,&quot; says Mr. Kasarda, theUniversity of North Carolina economic demographer. &quot;We tendto talk about `hot spots,' and growth becomes aself-fulfilling prophecy.&quot;   Migrants age 60 and older account for a net movement of $5billion a year to Florida, according to the University ofMiami's Center on Aging. &quot;The impact is huge because oncethat money is in the state, it circulates through theeconomy,&quot; says Charles Longino, director of the center.   The flow of people into Florida, Texas and California --states that accounted for more than half of U.S. populationgrowth in the past decade -- isn't only from the East Coastand industrial Midwest. Much of it comes from Latin Americaand Asia, with the immigrants moving into the city centersand the refugees from the North moving to suburban areas.   But all this growth also prompts new social and politicaltensions. When Hurricane Donna roared through Florida's westcoast in 1960, giving Naples its first national exposure, thecommunity was a relatively isolated enclave with a populationof just under 8,000. Acres of subdivisions and condominiums,plus growth spurred by the extension of Interstate 75 fromTampa and Fort Myers to the Naples area, have produced abustling community -- and a series of hot political disputesbetween young workers and upper-middle-income retirees,mainly from the Midwest.   &quot;There are competing needs of the retirement community andthe rest of the community, which needs roads and schools,&quot;says Stanley Litsinger, growth management director forCollier County. &quot;The result is some polarization in thecommunity and the development of a no-growth movement. Peoplehere are worried that if we grow too much, we'll have some ofthe undesirable aspects of the east coast of Florida.&quot;   The census data that have been coming out in recent weeksunderscore that growth isn't spread throughout the Sun Belt.The Sun Belt states of Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma,Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas and Mississippi all grew lessthan the national average of 9.8%.   The metropolitan area with the biggest rate of populationloss in the '80s was the Huntington-Ashland area that coversparts of West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio; its populationfell more than 21%. Other metropolitan areas with bigpopulation losses were Casper, Wyo., which lost 15%;Wheeling, W.Va., which lost 14%; and the Steubenville-Weirtonarea of Ohio and West Virginia, which declined 13%. Thepopulation of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which is nowjust over two million people, dropped 7%, about the same rateas the Youngstown, Ohio, metroplitan area, whose populationfell below 500,000.   Some of the population increase in the high-growth areasis generated by tourism, which provides jobs and also spursinterest in relocation. Indeed, the Florida Division ofTourism has determined that the states that contribute themost migrants also send the most tourists. &quot;Very few peoplemove to Florida sight unseen,&quot; says Barry Pitegoff, thestate's tourism research administrator. &quot;Most of these peoplehave selected the place where they move after a tourismvisit.&quot;   But there are clear signs that the surge in somehigh-growth areas is slowing.   Though census data and market statistics show Texas willgrow faster in the next several years than it did from 1984to 1989, growth in both Florida and California is expected toease. Florida grew 15.1% from 1984 to 1989 but is projectedto grow 11.9% from 1989 to 1994. An annual Allied Van Linesstudy of relocation patterns removed Florida from itscategory of magnet states -- those that have a minimum of 55%of Allied relocation into rather than out of a state -- forthe first time in the study's 23 years.   ---                         Hot Spots                                                                                                          Nine of the 12 fastest-growing U.S. metropolitan areas arein Florida.
