Their idea is to replace much of the four million barrelsof oil a day lost to world markets from the internationalembargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes. That, in turn,would slow the recent runup in petroleum prices, satisfypledges made to the Bush administration in regard to theMiddle East crisis and restrict the bold grab by Iran andsome others for former oil customers of Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   The strategy would include a gradual expansion of SaudiArabia's output by between 1.5 million and two millionbarrels a day and Venezuela's by 500,000 barrels a day. Someother nations in the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries with spare oil capacity also probably would beinvolved, including the United Arab Emirates, which couldincrease production by 500,000 barrels a day.   Whatever the decisions, they now are due quickly --possibly by this weekend. &quot;The situation will be very clearin a couple of days,&quot; a senior OPEC delegate who is close todevelopments said yesterday.   Venezuela has vacillated about filling the supply gapcreated by the Middle East crisis, with government officialsin Caracas this week backing away from an earlier promise toincrease exports. Yesterday, however, there were newindications that Venezuela now will be willing to join SaudiArabia and others in pumping more, after all. Saudi Arabia,widely expected to help offset the deficit early on, hadn'tincreased output substantially as it studied the matter.   It is already obvious that Saudi Arabia and Venezuelastill hope for OPEC's approval -- or at least that of amajority of OPEC's 13 members -- so that they won't beaccused of unilaterally breaking the group's late-Julyagreement limiting production. One formula under discussionwould maintain the OPEC production ceiling at 22.5 millionbarrels a day but divide it among 11 nations instead of 13,ignoring Iraq and Kuwait.   Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister, is understoodto have forwarded to Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil ministerand OPEC's president, a strongly worded letter urging againthat a special ministerial meeting be called promptly.Meanwhile, Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister,publicly announced that the kingdom also is pressing for anemergency meeting.   &quot;Saudi Arabia, with some other member countries of OPEC,has requested an immediate meeting of the organization inorder to make a joint decision that will deal with thecurrent situation in the oil market,&quot; Mr. Nazer said in agovernment statement.   As expected, the Saudis also rescinded indicated supplycuts for next month. This week, Saudi Aramco, the nationaloil company, has been notifying U.S., European and Japaneseoil companies of volume cuts of 15% to 20% for Septembershipments. The Aramco telexes got wide publicity amidspeculation that despite its indicated commitment to increaseproduction the kingdom was reducing it.   In Tokyo, Japanese buyers suggested that Saudi Arabia wasaware of the large volume of oil Japan is buying from Iran inSeptember and was going to supply other companies that hadbeen cut off from Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes. Among veterancustomers of Saudi Aramco elsewhere the telexes also wereshrugged off. It was assumed that Aramco officials, delugedby requests for oil in the wake of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis,were trying to meet needs of old and new customers bypro-rationing volumes available under their OPEC quota.   &quot;I think they got requests to supply Kuwait's customers,including Kuwait Petroleum Co. {operating in exile}, and theywanted to honor them,&quot; said Lawrence Goldstein, president ofthe Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. But, he added:&quot;They are still waiting for the king's decision to raisesupply.&quot;   Whatever the reason for the telexes, new ones are goingout quickly. &quot;There is going to be no cut for all our regularcustomers,&quot; said a Saudi petroleum official.   Despite the indications that added oil supplies will becoming into the market soon, petroleum prices rose againyesterday on increased Middle East tensions. Crude futureswere 60 cents a barrel higher on the London PetroleumExchange, and the September crude contract surged 90 cents,to $27.36, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Also, U.S.petroleum refiners raised field postings for West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark crude, by 75 cents, to $26 abarrel.   Although some OPEC member nations, including Nigeria,Libya and Iran, already have stepped up production slightlyto take advantage of the sharply higher demand for oil andthe higher prices, those that could really make a differencehave been slow to move. Meanwhile, Iraq, with the support ofits former war foe, Iran, has strongly condemned anyunilateral increases in oil output while its own suppliesremain embargoed.   As of late yesterday, according to OPEC sources, someothers still remained opposed to any emergency meeting toconsider officially sanctioned production increases. Otherswere on the fence, suggesting only that everyone wait a fewdays.   A major obstacle to any meeting of OPEC at this time isthe question of whether Kuwait would be represented and, ifso, by whom. On Aug. 2, Iraq marched in and took over itsneighbor.   If Kuwait's government-in-exile is counted, however, six,or possibly a majority of seven, of OPEC's 13 membersyesterday appeared in favor of an early emergency meeting.&quot;If this fails, or if we reach deadlock, a new avenue has tobe found,&quot; said one OPEC delegate, adding: &quot;We feel we haveto act now to stabilize the market.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Talks in Maine End; Worry forAmericans in Kuwait Increases&quot; -- WSJ Aug. 17, 1989)</TEXT></DOC>
