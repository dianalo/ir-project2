(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Bob Martinez is proposing limitinglawmakers to 12 years in office and sharply curbing gifts to publicofficials.   In a series of campaign stops, the Republican governor saidMonday that if re-elected he would push for the limit in aconstitutional amendment that would be placed on the 1992 ballotfor voters to decide.   The proposal also would limit Cabinet members to a pair offour-year terms, the same restriction now placed on the governor.   Voters in Oklahoma approved such a limit earlier this year, andsimilar measures will appear on ballots in California, Colorado andMissouri next month. The measures are seen as examples of voters'growing dissatisfaction with incumbents.   The governor's proposed legislation to curtail the gifts andtravel lavished on public officials comes amid an investigation byState Attorney Willie Meggs of Tallahassee into whether lawmakersproperly disclosed what they've received from lobbyists over thepast five years. Records of both lobbyists and legislators havebeen subpoenaed.
