This decline has coincided with another trend: thegrowth of military protectionism on the part of America'sfriends and allies in Europe and Asia, countries that at thesame time expect the U.S. to continue to take the lead inprotecting Western interests world-wide.   In an effort to boost U.S. arms exports, theadministration is proposing to allocate $1 billion ofExport-Import Bank credits to finance sales of U.S. equipmentto allied governments. Rep. David Obey, chairman of the HouseForeign Appropriations subcommittee, has attacked the idea,calling arms deals &quot;political rather than purely economictransactions.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But that's precisely the problem. In a period of decliningspending for defense, it is more important than ever todepoliticize military sales by opening up defense trade inthe West. We need what William Taft, U.S. ambassador to NATO,recently called a &quot;Defense GATT.&quot;   Establishing a free-trade regime for military exports inthe West would:   -- Give defense-competitive countries like the U.S. accessto bigger markets, leading to a better allocation of scarceresources for defense. It has been estimated, for example,that uneconomical defense production in Europe costs NATO $36billion a year.   -- Help the West maintain existing military capabilitieswhile also preserving a vibrant defense-industrial base. Thelatter will be vital if the U.S. and its allies are to retainthe ability to respond to future Iraqi-style contingencies.   -- Serve as an important signal that our allies understandthe continuing importance of a healthy U.S. defense sectorfor their own security. In this sense, it would constitute acontribution to Western defense &quot;burden-sharing.&quot;   It has become difficult in recent years to get alliedgovernments to accept cost-effectiveness as the mostimportant criterion for arms purchases. Over the past 20years, as the allies have developed their own defenseindustries, considerations of price and performance have beenincreasingly subordinated to domestic considerations (jobs)and abstract political goals, such as &quot;Europe-building.&quot;   The result is clear to see. In the early 1980s, theU.S.-European ratio in defense trade was seven-to-one. Today,the Defense Department says it is about 1.6 to 1. A similarpattern is emerging with Japan.   These trends reflect some key missed opportunities. A casein point is the Franco-German program for developing a newattack helicopter, the PAH-2. NATO analysts agree that themodernization of France's and Germany's aging anti-tankhelicopters is long overdue. But rather than selecting a U.S.system, such as the now-celebrated AH-64 Apache, Bonn andParis are continuing to develop their own. It will end upcosting almost twice as much as the Apache and will not beready until the end of the decade.   Another example is the troubled European Fighter Aircraftprogram. The consortium of European countries in the programnot only decided against buying an upgraded version of a U.S.aircraft -- the F-18 Hornet -- that would be much cheaperthan the plane it is developing on its own, but it alsoturned down a U.S. offer of an advanced radar for the plane,though no equivalent system has yet been developed in Europe.   As these cases suggest, defense protectionism comes with ahigh price tag. The key question, of course, is whether anopen, integrated market in military equipment is a realisticobjective.   The U.S. now imports roughly $2 billion in defenseequipment from Europe annually. But the U.S. spends more thantwice as much on defense as the European allies combined,three times more on military equipment, and over five timesmore on related Randamp;D. Consequently, U.S. weapons systems are,as a rule, more cost-effective and can be acquired morequickly.   At the same time, it is clearly not possible to return tothe era of the one-way street in arms sales. The Europeansand Japanese are not going to permit their relatively newdefense enterprises to go bust. Thus, in addition to pressingfor more open defense trade, the U.S. needs to exploreupgraded military cooperation; that is, the joint developmentand production of arms by equal U.S. and foreign partners.   Such cooperation would require changes in attitudes athome and abroad. Europe and Japan would have to move awayfrom their subsidization of redundant and duplicativeweapons. Major U.S. companies would have to abandon theirtendency to treat potential foreign partners as meresubcontractors. These adjustments could be aided by thecurrent move abroad toward larger defense-industrialconglomerates, such as Daimler-Benz AG in Germany andThomson-CSF in France. The continuing consolidation offoreign defense industries would give American contractorsmore genuinely equal partners.   There is also the question of technology transfer. If theU.S. wants expanded trade and cooperation in the militaryfield, it will have to be prepared to go further in offeringits allies such sensitive know-how as stealth technology. Amore flexible approach to sharing technology would make senseif it were coupled with tighter Western controls ontechnology exports to the Third World. Indeed, the end resultof greater military cooperation in the West could be a badlyneeded consensus on exports to volatile regions.   Establishing an open arms market in the West will not beeasy. But a failure to move in this direction will mean lesssecurity for the U.S. and its allies alike, as well as newstrains over trade policy at a moment we can ill afford them.Now that Operation Desert Storm is over, the U.S. nationalsecurity establishment needs to turns its attention towardOperation Free Trade.   ---   Mr. Burt, former arms negotiator and U.S. ambassador toGermany, is a special consultant with McKinsey andamp; Co. inWashington.</TEXT></DOC>
