The focus of this paper is on thetechnical aspects and operations of the MIIT experimental program, includingassorted repository-relevant observations and experience gathered aftermore than two years of in situ test operation. As such, this is primarilya descriptive ``hardware'' and test operations document; test data arepresented in parallel documents. 12 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
