Kraft said it agreed to sell Duracell Inc., the world's leadingmaker of alkaline consumer batteries, to concentrate on its corefood business.   Proceeds from the sale would be used to buy back up to 12million Kraft shares, to reduce debt and for possible food-relatedacquisition, the company said.   ``... We are excited about the many opportunities available toKraft in the food industry, and the sale of Duracell will enable usto focus our total management and financial resources on thoseopportunities,'' said Kraft Chairman John M. Richman.   Kraft informed its shareholders of the definitive agreement atits annual meeting Thursday in Chicago. Kraft, which acquiredBethel, Conn.-based Duracell in 1980, had announced in Decemberthat it planned to sell the unit.   Henry R. Kravis, a partner in New York-based Kohlberg Kravis,called the agreement ``the first step in the creation of a greatnew independent consumer-products company.''   ``We are very excited about the future growth prospects of thecompany and our future association with the management andemployees of Duracell,'' he said.   Some analysts expressed surprise at the price Kohlberg Kravisagreed to pay for Duracell, which had been widely expected to fetchbetween $1 billion and $1.2 billion.   ``It never ceases to amaze me what a good brand is worth intoday's marketplace,'' said John W. McMillin of Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. ``This was pleasant news for Kraft shareholders.''   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kraft rose$1.50 a share to close at $53.50.   McMillin said Kohlberg Kravis probably was attracted byDuracell's strong growth potential.   Duracell, which has about 9,000 employees, had an operatingincome of $140 million and sales of $1.1 billion last year. Kraft's1987 sales, excluding Duracell, were $9.9 billion.   Duracell's copper-top alkaline batteries account for about 28percent of all U.S. consumer battery sales.   The company is tied with Ralston Purina Co.'s Eveready unit forthe lead in domestic sales of alkaline batteries, thefastest-growing segment of the battery market.   Together, Eveready and Duracell have more than 80 percent of thedomestic alkaline-battery market, McMillin said. Duracell does notcompete in the carbon-zinc battery market, which is dominated byEveready.   ``With all these Walkmans and portable tape recorders that haveto use batteries, the alkaline segment has been exhibiting strongvolume growth and that is what had to attract these investors,''McMillin said.   Analysts said they did not expect Duracell to diversify as astand-alone company.   ``It could happen in time, but certainly not immediately,'' saidLawrence Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in NewYork.   ``When you do a leveraged buyout you've got to use the cashgenerated internally to reduce debt, so you've got to pretty muchstick to your own business.''   Duracell is being sold to Duracell Holdings Corp., the newcompany formed by Kohlberg Kravis and Duracell's management.Kohlberg Kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts, in which acompany is acquired mainly through borrowed funds repaid from thetarget company's profits or asset sales.</TEXT></DOC>
