Ships were allowed to leave the harbor for the first time inmore than a week.   Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene said wind pushed a slick of oilsurrounding Houston Point and its sensitive marshes back intoGalveston Bay on Sunday. Some of the oil washed ashore, whilestreamers of up to 100 yards in length moved northeast towardTrinity Bay, a marine area.   Approximately 315,000 gallons of the refinery oil from thebarge-tanker collision had been collected by Sunday afternoon,Greene said.   About 150 contract workers and 90 Coast Guardsmen were workingon the cleanup, which will cost about $5 million, Greene said.   The oil was spilled July 28 when the Greek tanker Shinoussacollided with two barges under tow by the Chandy N in the HoustonShip Channel.   ``Traffic is moving, just not freely,'' said Scott Inbody, chiefwarrant officer of the Coast Guard's vessel traffic service inHouston. ``We're making sure no vessels meet or overtake each otherin the waters near the accident.''   The ship channel was opened to inbound towboat traffic Friday.It had been closed since the accident while the Coast Guard workedto free the barge that had partially sunk in the collision.   The Coast Guard hoped to open the channel to unrestrictedtwo-way traffic by Monday, Inbody said.   ``We have outbound ships and inbound towboats, pulling orpushing barges, moving right now,'' he said. About 40 vessels werewaiting to get into the channel and 10 were waiting to leave lateSunday, the Coast Guard said.   At a hearing on collision Sunday, Shinoussa crewmen blamed theHouston pilot who guided them through the channel for baddirections. The pilot contends the helmsman failed to followinstructions and steered into the oncoming barges after anothership passed.   State officials planned to spread about 150 pounds of thebacteria around Houston Point and its marshes Sunday. The microbes,which occur naturally in small amounts, are bred to reduce oil to afatty substance that sinks and can be eaten by fish.   When the oil is gone, the microbes die. The process is calledbioremediation.   ``We've got oil about 30 feet into the marshlands,'' Texas WaterCommission chairman B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne said Sunday. ``We're tryingto do as much as we can today.''   Wynne said bacteria used on Pelican Island last week seems tohave been beneficial, but tests have not been completed.   ``This is different from oil on rocks or oil in open waters,''Wynne said. ``This is on a living, organic system and it'sabsolutely the most sensitive place it can be.''   Dead crabs, mussels and other small marine animals have beenfound on the shore around Houston Point, said Larry McKinney,director of the resource protection division of the Texas Parks andWildlife Department.   A ban on shrimping in Galveston Bay continued Sunday, but finfishing remained open.</TEXT></DOC>
