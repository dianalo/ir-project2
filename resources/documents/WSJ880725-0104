The Supreme Court led the way some months ago with the first of several rulings against uncompensated &quot;takings&quot; through regulation. In compliance with the new jurisprudence, President Reagan in March issued an executive order to curtail such actions. This month, his order was implemented by the Justice Department with a tough new set of guidelines for federal agencies.    Such actions to protect the civil rights of Americans against high-handed federal, state and local bureaucrats were long overdue. But before we all celebrate, it might pay to look at what appears to be a well-camouflaged effort in the U.S. Senate to undermine this noble restoration of an essential protection of free citizens against governmental tyranny.    Two weeks ago, Teddy Kennedy, Joe Biden and like-minded colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee quietly lynched the President's nominee for a judgeship on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Diego. The nominee, as it happens, was the man who began the campaign for economic civil rights more than a decade ago, Bernard Siegan of the University of San Diego law school.    With Mr. Siegan's ideas so clearly in the ascendancy, the Senators chose not to engage him on the merits of his views. Indeed, Alan Cranston of California refused even to meet with his home-state nominee. We can ascribe this only to an unwillingness by the Senators to publicly defend property seizures. Instead, they simply delayed action on the nomination for an unconscionable period. Over the past 20 years, the Senate has voted on judicial nominees on average within a month of their nominations; the 17-month delay in Mr. Siegan's case broke all records. In the end, when the nomination was finally rejected by a party-line committee vote, Teddy Kennedy simply asserted, without explanation, that Mr. Siegan was &quot;out of the mainstream.&quot;    Mr. Siegan, an able and articulate legal scholar who practiced law in Chicago for 20 years before beginning his academic career at the University of Chicago, actually is very much a part of today's mainstream -- which was Teddy Kennedy's real problem. In 1976, Mr. Siegan introduced what were then dusty ideas on private property in his &quot;Other People's Property.&quot; This was followed by &quot;Economic Liberties and the Constitution&quot; in 1980. He argued that the Founders through the Fifth Amendment takings clause and the contracts clause of Article I intended to protect economic rights to the full extent of all civil rights.    &quot;Taking&quot; of property, he argued, isn't confined to seizing someone's land to build a highway. There also can be &quot;regulatory takings,&quot; where bureaucrats effectively take away property value through overly burdensome zoning or environmental regulations.    The Supreme Court has upheld the Siegan view in several cases. In Nollan v. California Coastal Commission California had tried to withhold permission for a homeowner to build an addition to his beach house unless he granted a public right of way. The high court said this was a taking camouflaged as a regulation and that it required compensation. In another case, the court ruled that the government must compensate for delays while takings are challenged.    These decisions are milestones in the move back to the pre-New Deal era when economic rights got the same protection as other civil liberties. The government is now on notice that regulations that limit how property can be used also can require compensation. There are suits against the federal government in the Court of Claims for some $1 billion for such regulatory takings. Many are the result of unnecessarily draconian regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency.    President Reagan's Executive Order 12630 requires a &quot;Takings Implication Analysis&quot; before federal regulators affect private property and thereby risk &quot;undue additional burdens on the public fisc.&quot; Attorney General Meese issued a thick stack of guidelines for all agencies to follow. States and localities would be wise to adopt similar rules to make sure they don't saddle their taxpayers with bills for takings.    We have not heard the last from Mr. Siegan. He plans to keep teaching and writing on economic rights. He also plans a book on his experience with the Judiciary Committee. This might again mean debating a blank wall. But the unwillingness of the Senators to engage in a public discussion of economic civil rights and their reasons for rejecting Mr. Siegan probably tell us as much about their positions as we'll ever need to know. </TEXT></DOC>
