The five-nation committee, comprising ministers from Venezuela,Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Algeria, met behind closeddoors at a luxury hotel in this lakeside city.   Venezuelan oil minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Tuesdayone item on the agenda would be a report by OPEC Secretary-GeneralSubroto, of Indonesia, on his visit to the United Arab Emirates inJuly.   Subroto visited the U.A.E. after it decided to abandon its OPECoil production quota of 948,000 barrels a day and said it would aimfor a daily output of 1.5 million barrels.   The committee is also to discuss the OPEC auditors' report forthe cartel's production in May, as well as estimates from secondarysources for June and July production.   Indonesian oil minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said Tuesday thatindustry estimates for June OPEC production were between18.54-18.56 million barrels a day, while July production estimateswere understood to be around 19 million barrels a day.   One OPEC delegate source said ``19 million barrels a day isdefinitely too much (for OPEC to be producing). We will never seeprices recover in the short-to-medium term at that level.''   In a related development, Saudi Arabian oil minister HishamNazer, responding to press reports that his country's oil output inJuly was above its OPEC quota, said Wednesday, ``that is wrong.''He said Saudi Arabia is producing within its output quota of 4.343million barrels a day.   The OPEC price committee is empowered to study world oil pricetrends, and to call an emergency meeting of the full 13-member OPECministerial conference if it finds that world oil prices havediverged significantly from OPEC's $18-a-barrel average referenceprice.   Delegate sources said another topic of discussion by the pricingcommittee would be the effect on OPEC production levels of apossible ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.   The sources said that two opinions have apparently arisen on thepossible effect.   Some within OPEC believe a ceasefire could result in the twocountries' flooding world oil markets with crude as they try tosell more oil to finance the reconstruction of their war-torneconomies.   Others seem to think that an end to the war would mean greatercooperation within OPEC and lead to production restraint, thesources said.</TEXT></DOC>
