 You cancreate soft fonts with one of the font generators reviewed in this issue.andP;  Oryou can buy soft fonts already prepared for you by a font vendor in one ofthe packages reviewed here.andM;Since a font generator can produce fonts in any point size you need, why buyprecooked soft fonts at all?andP;  Two reasons.andP;  Quality and price.andM;When you buy the better-prepared soft fonts, you get fonts that someone hasoptimized by hand for the best possible print quality.andP;  You may have to lookclosely, but if you compare the Garamond fonts created with Bitstream'sFontware font generator to the Garamond fonts handcrafted by Bitstream andmarketed by HP, you'll see slightly smoother edges and slightly betterconsistency in the handcrafted versions.andP;  The differences are subtle butunmistakable.andM;As for price, the best typeface outlines for font generators cost $195 for apackage of four.andP;  If the only soft fonts you need are an 11-point Baskervilleand a 30-point Helvetica, you can buy them for as little as $15 each.andP;  Youcan also browse through BBSs and download public-domain fonts that will costyou all of a local phone call.andM;Unfortunately, a package of the best-prepared fonts tends to cost as much asa pcakge of the best typeface outlines.andP;  So if you choose prepared softfonts, you will probably choose them for reasons of quality or price, but notboth.andM;A NEW REPUTATIONandM;Soft fonts have a reputation for being overwhelmingly difficult to use.andO;Until recently, that reputation was thoroughly deserved, but smartapplications have begun to make the reality differ from the reputation.andO;Smart applications can install fonts automatically (that is, they can get allthe information they need for printing from the font files themselves), orthey can download fonts automatically when necessary, or both.andM;With the very smartest applications, all you have to do is copy your fontsinto a \FONTS directory (or, for PostScript typeface outlines, a \PSFONTSdirectory), tell your application the name of that directory, and wait a fewmoments while the application scans the font files in the directory forinformation about the size of each character and other technical details.andO;You can then use the fonts with that application as easily as you can use theLaserJet's built-in Courier or the various typeface outlines built intoPostScript printers.andP;  When you're ready to print, the application willdownload to the printer any font that you selected in your document.andM;So far, only one major application, Lotus Manuscript, can accomplish everystage of this process automatically for both the LaserJet and PostScriptprinters.andP;  WordStar, Release 5.0, comes a close second.andP;  It includes astandalone utility for installing both LaserJet fonts and Adobe PostScripttypeface outlines.andP;  WordStar will create a batch file that you can use fordownloading fonts before you enter WordStar, but WordStar won't downloadfonts by itself.andM;NOT AS SMARTandM;Other applications are smart, but not as smart.andP;  Recent versions of theLaserJet driver for Microsoft Windows can install fonts, but they won'tinclude the kerning data that you get from third-party font installers.andO;WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, Ventura Publisher, and Nota Bene will downloadfonts when needed--or will offer you the chance to download them whenneeded--but they can't install fonts by themselves.andP;  WordPerfect, MicrosoftWord, Nota Bene, and XyWrite come with drivers for HP's soft fonts(WordPerfect also supports a few LaserJet fonts from other vendors); andWordPerfect and Ventura come with drivers for Adobe's PostScript typefaceoutlines; but otherwise you generally have to install any soft fonts you buy,either with utilities that accompany the fonts or with third-party utilities.andM;The main exceptions to this rule are soft-font packages that emulate one ofHP's font cartridges.andP;  With these packages, you use a supplied utility todownload the fonts to the printer, then tell your application that you'reusing the equivalent cartridge and proceed as if you really did have thatcartridge plugged into the printer.andP;  Some of these emulations, as pointed outin the reviews, work better than others.andM;If your prepared fonts don't come with utilities to install them in yourapplications, all is not lost.andP;  SoftCraft's WYSI-fonts!, which comes with theSoftCraft Font Solution Pack, installs any LaserJet font, complete withkerning data and screen fonts, in Windows and Ventura, and the same vendor'sLaserFonts and LaserFonts Font Manager (also included in the SoftCraft FontSolution Pack) installs them in WordPerfect and Word.andP;  Agfa Compugraphic andHP's Type Director does the same job with Windows, Ventura, and Word, andWordPerfect support is on the way.andP;  The Lodestar Utilities will do the samefor XyWrite and Nota Bene.andP;  Word, Nota Bene, and XyWrite do not currentlymake use of kerning data.andM;When you install fonts in Windows, they are immediately available from anyWindows application's font menu.andP;  With WordPerfect you have to go to thePrinter menu, select the printer, and then edit the driver to select your newfonts.andP;  In word you have to choose the right .PRD file from the Print Optionsmenu.andP;  In Ventura, whenever you install new fonts, you first have to useVentura's &quot;Merge new width tables&quot; command to install the width table for thefonts you've added.andM;You can also install LaserJet soft fonts manually in Windows and Venturausing a complex series of commands spelled out in the manual.andP;  The Venturaprocedure is especially hair-raising.andM;MAKE ROOM FOR FONTSandM;Before you can install a soft font, you have to find room for it on your harddisk.andP;  This can be more of a problem than it sounds.andP;  A 10-point,normal-weight LaserJet text font with the USASCII (low-order) character setcan occupy 10K or less.andP;  But a 30-point bold font will occupy 70K or more.andO;Extended character sets will double these figures.andP;  Although most packages ofLaserJet fonts take up about 1MB of disk space, a full family of fonts, likeGaramond normal, italic, bold, and bold italic, in ten sizes from 6 to 30points, can swallow 5 or 6MB in a single gulp.andP;  It's not unusual to meet asufferer from font fever whose hard disk groans under the weight of 40MB offonts.andP;  (A PostScript typeface outline and its associated font-metric filetypically require only about 50 to 80K, and you need only one outline for allpoint sizes.andP;  This saves an enormous amount of space.)andM;Some soft font packages automatically copy a couple of megabytes of fonts toyour hard disk and install them all in an application.andP;  You can delete theones you don't intend to use, but uninstalling them, so that they don'tappear on the menu, can be trickier.andP;  However, SoftCraft's installationutilities can also uninstall fonts on command.andP;  Other packages simply giveyou floppy disks full of font files, and you can copy only the ones you needto your hard disk.andP;  If you're willing to live with the inconvenience, you canstore all your fonts on floppies and not burden your hard disk.andP;  Just tellyour applications that your font directory is A:\ and be ready to insert theright disk when needed.andM;Whether your bother to store a font at all depends finally on whether it'sgood enough to use twice.andP;  Soft fonts vary widely in quality from one vendorto another.andP;  Homegrown fonts, based loosely on classic designs, often lookcoarse or crude.andP;  But even when a vendor offers a font licensed from one ofthe great type house like Linotype or International Typeface Corp. (ITC), youstill have no guarantee of quality.andP;  And when two vendors offer the samelicensed font, there may be startling differences between the two versions.andO;Typically, the licenser of a font supplies an &quot;analog&quot; outline drawing of thetypeface, and it's up to the licensee to translate it into a digital bitmap.andO;The art of translating an analog to a digital font requires enormousresources of skill and time.andP;  Some vendors, unfortunately, rush to marketwithout expending much of either.andP;  The results speak for themselves.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
