I had argued extensively that in order to understand theconflict in Cambodia today it is essential to discuss thecolonial ambitions of the Vietnamese communists. That issueexplains why the Khmer Rouge insurgency persists with somevoluntary support, in spite of past Khmer Rouge atrocities.It is thus crucial for any examination of American policy.What is remarkable about Mr. Jennings's reply is that hestill manages deftly to skirt consideration of Vietnam'scritical role.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Jennings cannot understand my challenge to thedocumentary's apocalyptic premise. I conclude that the KhmerRouge are &quot;far from likely to seize {power} soon.&quot; Hecounters with a view that &quot;. . . the Khmer Rouge is capableof rolling over the PRK&quot; (the Phnom Penh regime). I do notdisagree with the statement. Yet the Khmer Rouge and thenoncommunists are fighting not only the PRK but alsoVietnamese troops and advisersa crucial fact that ABC'sdocumentary denied. Moreover, the Khmer Rouge are restrainedby fear of greater Vietnamese reintervention should they tryto seize power soon. That is why the Khmer Rouge are fightingnot to seize power but to pressure Phnom Penh into acompromise political settlement.   Mr. Jennings confuses the point that I made when I wroteof his &quot;extraordinary statement&quot; that Phnom Penh's army&quot;alone, without the Vietnamese&quot; has &quot;a real problem fighting&quot;the resistance supported by the U.S. and China. My point wasthat the Phnom Penh army is not alone &quot;without theVietnamese,&quot; nor alone without the Soviet Union.   Mr. Jennings has no idea whether the Phnom Penh leadersare &quot;unrepentant&quot; Khmer Rouge, as I assert, and suspects thatI do not have proof. But one fact is compelling evidence of&quot;unrepentance.&quot; In spite of their frequent ritualdenunciation of Pol Pot's atrocities, Phnom Penh's leadershave never apologized for their own role in so many of them.These atrocities include the forced evacuation of the cities,the murder of thousands of people identified with the formerregime, the abolition of religion and the forced dispersal ofthe Cham Moslem minority communities.   In his eagerness to put the best possible face on PhnomPenh by asserting declining repression in Cambodia today, Mr.Jennings misrepresents the most recent Amnesty report (March1989). Amnesty cites little more than 400 political prisonersof the Phnom Penh regime by name. But it does not suggestthat this amounts to anything like the total number detained.Moreover, it notes that the 412 officially reported arrestsin Siem Reap-Utdar Meanchey province alone during the firstnine months of 1988 were greater than in previous years.   Mr. Jennings is most incensed by what he calls my&quot;insidious&quot; and &quot;unsubstantiated&quot; description of producerLeslie Cockburn as a &quot;committed left ideologue.&quot; Readers whomissed Ms. Cockburn's 1987 PBS documentary &quot;Murder on the RioSan Juan&quot; (which suggested that the CIA tried to murderNicaraguan Contra leader Eden Pastora) should consult herrambling tract &quot;Out of Control,&quot; based on related work atCBS. There Ms. Cockburn propounds the theory of a U.S.Central America policy carried out by an &quot;old-boy network&quot; offormer CIA operatives, assassins and drug runners. In supportof her tale, she extensively cites Daniel Sheehan of theChristic Institute, which sued a number of different peoplewho aided the Nicaraguan Contras. Mr. Sheehan's tale wastested in a Miami court in 1988. The judge not only dismissedMr. Sheehan's suit, but also assessed him $1 million in legalfees for bringing an unsubstantiated suit.   One victim here is American Special Forces Col. DennyLane. Why does Mr. Jennings still insist on indicting Col.Lane for a crime (providing American aid to the Khmer Rouge)by insinuation and innuendo? If ABC has evidence, then whyhasn't it produced it?   Had Mr. Jennings's ABC team been interested in a fairexamination of American policy -- which supports Cambodia'snoncommunists -- it would have discussed the fact that mostof Cambodia's noncommunist leaders and all of its soldiersare holocaust survivors who dread the idea of a Khmer Rougereturn to power. ABC would have pondered America's failure toprovide lethal aid to such worthy recipients, instead offalsely asserting its flow. ABC also would have discussedHanoi's continuing colonial intervention and politicalintransigence, which have forced the reluctant and limitedalliance between the noncommunists and their formertormentors. But such themes would have presented the strugglefor Cambodia, and American policy, as complex moral problems.ABC's documentary could not have remained the simple tale ofAmerican political perfidy and moral callousness -- a talethat Mr. Jennings and Ms. Cockburn tell so easily.
