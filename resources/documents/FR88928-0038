White, Chief, RegulationsStaff (211B), Compensation and Pension Service, Department of VeteransBenefits, (202) 233-3005.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The current VA regulation on proceduraldue process (38 CFR 3.103) was published in 1972. Since that time, however,there have been several court decisions which have had a major impact onprocedural due process with respect to Federal benefit programs.In light of that impact the VA has initiated a review of its adjudicationregulations in an effort to identify and amend any existing rules thatmay not satisfy current standards for procedural due process. This reviewis ongoing and additional amendments may be proposed in the future.We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.103 to clarify the due process rightsof claimants and beneficiaries. With a few minor grammatical and technicalchanges, andSection; 3.103(a) is being retained. A sentence has been addedto express the general policy that claimants are entitled to notice ofthe decisions made on their claims, the opportunity for a hearing and representationof their choice. With a minor technical change and substitution of gender-neutralterms, andSection; 3.103(b) on submission of evidence, and andSection; 3.103(d)representation are also being retained, but are redesignated as andSection;andSection;3.103(d) and 3.103(e), respectively.Section 3.103(b) has been added to more clearly define the right of claimantsto notice of VA decisions. The essential notice requirements containedin andSection; 3.103(e) have been incorporated into new andSection; 3.103(b)(1).The notice is required to clearly set forth the decision made, any applicableeffective date, and the reasons for the decision as well as the right toa hearing, the right of representation and the right to appeal.Section 3.103(b)(2) sets forth additional new requirements for notice toclaimants when the decision involves termination, suspension or reductionof benefits being paid. Unless otherwise provided, beneficiaries wouldbe entitled to a minimum of 60 days notice prior to the taking of an adverseaction so that they may offer evidence for the purpose of showing thatthe adverse action should not be taken.Section 3.103(b)(3) provides for exceptions to the general notice rulein four specific situations where pre-termination/reduction notice wouldnot be required but where notice contemporaneous with the adverse actionwould generally be required. The rationale behind these exceptions is toprevent the issuance of benefit checks in those circumstances where itis reasonable to conclude that the beneficiary would either not receivethem or would not be entitled to them and that any attempt to provide advancenotice to the beneficiary would be either unsuccessful or unnecessary.The first exception to the pre-termination/reduction notice rule involvessituations where benefit checks are returned to the VA as undeliverable.In such cases the VA could not reasonably be expected to provide meaningfuladvance notice of suspension or termination since the only address to whichnotice could be sent would be the address from which the check had beenreturned.The second exception involves written, factual, unambiguous informationas to income, net worth, dependency or marital status which is providedby the beneficiary or his/her fiduciary with knowledge or notice that theinformation would be used to calculate benefits and where the legal standardsapplied to this information are numerical in nature. When a beneficiaryreports such information, advance notice of an adverse action based onthat information would not be required.The third exception involves failure to return a required eligibility verificationreport. Courts have previously held that adverse action based on failureto return an annual income questionnaire requires only contemporaneousnotice.The fourth exception involves evidence received by the VA which reasonablyindicates that the beneficiary is deceased. In such cases pre-terminationnotice would clearly be ineffective and unnecessary. In the case of allfour exceptions to the advance notice provisions, notice contemporaneouswith the adverse action will be required except in three specific casesof beneficiary death. If the VA receives a death certificate, a terminalhospital report or a claim for VA burial benefits in connection with abeneficiary's death, no notice of award termination (contemporaneous orotherwise) will be required.Section 3.103(c) of the proposed regulation sets forth a claimant's orbeneficiary's right to a hearing. With minor format and gender-neutralchanges, andSection;andSection; 3.103(c)(1) and 3.103(c)(2) are simply a restatementof the current rule with minor modifications, consistent with the presenthearing procedures. Section 3.103(e) has also been retained with minorformat and gender-neutral changes and is redesignated as andSection; 3.103(f).Our review for the purpose of improving due process procedures identified38 CFR 3.105 as one regulation that needed significant revision in orderto afford beneficiaries adequate notice when reductions or discontinuancesof benefits are being contemplated. The amendment being proposed wouldrequire that prior to any reduction or discontinuance of benefits underandSection; 3.105 the beneficiary would have to be provided advance writtenmotice of the proposed adverse action and a period of 60 days in whichto submit evidence for the purpose of showing that the adverse action shouldnot be taken. In addition, if a predetermination hearing is requested within30 days of the notice of proposed adverse action, benefits would be continuedat the previously established level until the hearing is held (or reasonablyafforded) and a final determination is made concerning the proposed adverseaction.At the expiration of the 60-day period noted above or following the predeterminationhearing, whichever is later, a final decision would be made. The beneficiarywould be notified of the final decision, and, where the effective dateof reduction or discontinuance is linked to a date of notice to the beneficiary,the effective date would be linked to the date of notice of the final decision.Otherwise, the effective date of reduction or discontinuance would be inaccordance with 38 CFR 3.500-3.503.We are also proposing to amend andSection;andSection; 3.109 and 3.110 concerningcomputation of the time limits within which claimants or beneficiariesare required to provide evidence or respond to requests for evidence. Thecurrent provisions of andSection;andSection; 3.109(a)(1) and 3.109(a)(2) arepositive statements as to time limits for filing evidence, but andSection;3.109(b) is a negative statement as to occurrences which will not extendtime limits. This is inconsistent with the VA's usual practice of issuingregulations that are positive in tone and is also inappropriate with respectto due process.If claimants or beneficiaries are not furnished notice of the time limitswithin which they are required to act, it is unreasonable to penalize themfor failing to act within those time limits. We are, therefore, proposingto amend andSection; 3.109(b) to positively state those occurrences whichwill extend regulatory time limits. The proposed amendment provides thatfailure to notify a claimant or beneficiary of the time limit within whichevidence must be submitted to perfect a claim or to challenge an adverseagency decision will extend the time limit for such action in accordancewith andSection; 3.110. We also propose to amend andSection; 3.110 by addinga new andSection; 3.110(b) to provide that, in computing the time limit withinwhich a claimant or beneficiary must act, the first day of the specifiedperiod shall be the date of mailing of notification to the claimant orbeneficiary of the action required and the time limit therefor, and thatthe date of the letter of notification shall be considered the date ofmailing.In unpublished opinions the VA General Counsel held that, where entitlementto benefits is established on the basis of a liberalizing law or VA administrativeissue, retroactive benefits could be paid, under certain circumstances,for up to one year prior to the date of receipt of an original claim underthe provisions of andSection; 3.114(a) (undigested General Counsel opinion,May 3, 1984, on the subject of 38 CFR 3.114; undigested General Counselopinion, July 17, 1984, on the subject of 38 CFR 3.114). The opinions notedthat the legislative history of the statutory authority for this regulation(38 U.S.C. 3010(g)) indicated an intent that retroactive payments be availableto individuals who were ``potential beneficiaries'' on the effective dateof the liberalizing law or VA issue regardless of whether they had previouslyfiled a claim for such benefits. We are, therefore, proposing to amendandSection; 3.114(a) to clarify that in order to be entitled to retroactivebenefits under this section a claimant must have met <T3>all </T3>of the eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit onthe effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue and that such eligibilityexisted continuously from that date to the date of claim or administrativedetermination of entitlement. The proposed amendment also provides thatthe provisions of andSection; 3.114(a) are applicable to original and reopenedclaims as well as claims for increase.The Administrator hereby certifies that these proposed regulatory amendmentswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5U.S.C. 601-612. The reason for this certification is that these amendmentswould not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries wouldbe directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendmentsare exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirementsof sections 603 and 604.In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Administratorhas determined that these proposed regulatory amendments are nonmajor forthe following reasons:(1) They will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more.(2) They will not cause a major increase in costs or prices.(3) They will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program numbers are 64.100,64.101, 64.104, 64.105, 64.106, 64.109 and 64.110.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 3</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Handicapped, Health care,Pensions, Veterans Administration.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: September 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas K.

The VA will provide the place of hearing inthe VA office having original jurisdiction over the claim or at the VAoffice nearest the claimant's home having adjudicative functions, and willprovide VA personnel who have original determinative authority of suchissues to conduct the hearing and be responsible for establishment andpreservation of the hearing record. Hearings in connection with proposedadverse actions and appeals shall be held before VA personnel having originaldeterminative authority who did not participate in the proposed actionor the decision being appealed. All expenses incurred by the claimant inconnection with the hearing are the responsibility of the claimant.(2) The claimant is entitled to produce witnesses and all testimony willbe under oath or affirmation. The purpose of a hearing is to permit theclaimant to introduce into the record in person any available evidencewhich the claimant may consider material and any arguments and contentionswith respect to the facts and applicable law which the claimant may considerpertinent. It is the responsibility of the VA personnel conducting thehearings to explain fully the issues and suggest the submission of evidencewhich the claimant may have overlooked and which would be of advantageto the claimant's position. To assure clarity and completeness of the hearingrecord, questions which are directed to the claimant and to witnesses areto be framed to explore fully the basis for claimed entitlement ratherthan with an intent to refute evidence or to discredit testimony. In casesin which the nature, origin, or degree of disability is in issue, the claimantmay request visual examination by a physician designated by the VA andthe physician's observations will be read into the record.(d) <T3>Submission of evidence</T3>.
