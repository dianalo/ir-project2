Some ministerial sources suggested that OPEC may trim between 5% and 10% from its current output, estimated at around 17 million barrels a day.    Many delegates here feel that Saudi Arabia would support a production cut. The Saudis have indicated they would go along with whatever it takes to boost oil prices, provided OPEC members show a seriousness of purpose -- including strict adherence to production quotas and an attempt to strive towards fixed prices.    The Saudis' acting oil minister, Hisham Nazer, in his first appearance at an OPEC meeting, made no firm proposal, but strongly advocated a resolution of the issue by Sunday. He argued that the long and tortuous negotiations that have become customary at OPEC meetings only weaken oil markets' confidence in the group.    Mr. Nazer's appeal was echoed by several other oil ministers, who contended that OPEC's first priority is to push oil prices well above the current average of $14 a barrel. &quot;Our gift for the new year will be $18 oil,&quot; said Manei Saeed al-Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates' oil minister, as he emerged from the first day's talks.    Delegates, however, cautioned that despite the display of unity, some hurdles remain. Among these are the possible refusal of Iraq to cut its output. When OPEC adopted a production cut of nearly four million barrels a day last August, Iraq was left out of the accord.    Oil prices spurted on U.S. spot and futures markets on rumors that Saudi Arabia privately agreed to cut output at the initial session of OPEC's ministerial meeting in Geneva.    The mood in OPEC, after a year in which prices plunged to as low as $7 a barrel, was summed up by Nigerian oil minister Rilwanu Lukman, the conference's president. &quot;Today's prices,&quot; Mr. Lukman told the conference, &quot;cannot by any yardstick be judged . . . fair . . . . Our aim is to ensure continued upward movement in prices.&quot;    Though Mr. Lukman said OPEC's goal is to raise prices to $18 a barrel, other ministers, including representatives of Iran, Algeria and Libya, said they would like prices to go as high as $28 a barrel.    But these differences were eclipsed by a palpable determination to have what one minister described as a &quot;quick fix.&quot; Where oil prices finally settle isn't important &quot;as long as it is more . . . . We are all united by one thing,&quot; said the minister, who asked not to be identified. &quot;We can all use the money now.&quot;    It remains to be seen whether Iraq will be included in any accord on production cuts by OPEC. Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Agazadeh, who engineered the compromise that ended the price war Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were advocating last August, said at the time that Iraq's exemption wouldn't be allowed to last long.    Delegates now wonder if the Iranians, whose oil-loading facilities have been under constant attack by Iraq since then, will tolerate a continuation of Iraq's freewheeling production.    Iranian sources suggested, however, that higher oil prices remain a primary objective for Iran, which needs revenue to fuel its seven-year-old war with Iraq and to consolidate its primacy in OPEC.    Another obstacle is presented by some small producers, including Gabon and Ecuador, which are too poor to accommodate a cut in output, sources said. Ministerial sources said, however, that those two countries could be exempted.    OPEC ministers also listened to a report from the group's economic commission, which suggested that pushing prices up sharply may require a production cut in the first quarter to as low as 15.8 million barrels a day. But Kuwait's oil minister, Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, said the decision on production levels is for ministers to take, regardless of the experts' recommendation.    The last of the ministers to take the floor -- and the focus of much attention -- was Mr. Nazer, who succeeded Ahmed Zaki Yamani after his dismissal in October by Saudi King Fahd. Mr. Nazer displayed what one minister described as a &quot;very businesslike, fast-moving style.&quot; Part of the Saudi official's concern was to recapture the political initiative in OPEC from Iran, which since last summer has led the organization's quest for higher prices.    Among other things, Mr. Nazer urged OPEC to keep its meetings short instead of the two to three weeks to which it has become accustomed. He also secured his colleagues' agreement to hold meetings only in Vienna, where OPEC is headquartered, in order to reduce expenses. And he pressed other ministers to speak to the press only through an official spokesman -- a move intended to strengthen the group's credibility.    Last night, the dominant feeling was that OPEC will succeed. &quot;The spirit of the conference is good, and morale is high,&quot; said Venezuela's oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti. &quot;I am optimistic.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
