Penney</HL><DD> 03/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MCIC JCP </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   MCI Communications Corp. said its Northeast division reached an agreement with J.C. Penney Co. to provide the retailer with much of its nationwide voice and data communications requirements.    MCI, a telecommunications concern, said the agreement illustrates its current strategy of trying to tailor products to the needs of its big business customers.    The Penney agreement calls for MCI to couple its Prism high-volume discount service with the private satellite network it already provides for New York-based J.C. Penney's internal voice, data and video-conferencing services. This will allow Penney employees to use MCI service to complete calls terminating at points beyond the private, internal network.    An MCI spokeswoman said the agreement would increase revenue from the J.C. Penney account, but she declined to specify by how much. MCI said it expects Penney's use of the services to exceed four million calls a month of voice traffic. </TEXT></DOC>
