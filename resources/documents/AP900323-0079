AKRE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nine crew members remained missing andwere presumed drowned today after a fishing vessel capsized andquickly sank in the frigid Bering Sea, the Coast Guard said.   Twenty-two crew members were rescued Thursday after the 162-footSeattle-based Aleutian Enterprise sank about 60 miles south of theremote Pribilof Islands town of St. Paul, Coast Guard spokesmanChristopher Haley said in Juneau.   The search for missing sailors was suspended late Thursday.Coast Guard Lt. Brian Flory said this morning that it was unlikelythe Coast Guard would resume the search.   ``We had a very good search yesterday,'' he said. ``We think wewould have found anyone who was afloat. I don't think that of thenine missing that anyone got off the vessel.''   The cause of the capsizing was not immediately known. The siteis north of the Aleutian Islands chain and southwest of the Alaskamainland.   The Coast Guard had previously reported that 10 were missing;the figure was revised to nine today without explanation.   Haley said none of the crew was wearing wearing survival suits.Coast Guard officials said a person probably couldn't survive morethan 30 minutes in the frigid waters without such suits.   The survivors, all in life rafts, were picked up soon after theship sank Thursday afternoon by two sister ships, the NorthernEnterprise and the Pacific Enterprise. A Coast Guard C-130transport plane was on the scene to provide rescue communicationsand medical advice, Haley said.   About six fishing vessels were in the area and had assisted inthe rescue and search, said Dan Roberts, executive vice presidentof Arctic Alaska Fisheries Corp., which manages the AleutianEnterprise for a partnership that owns it.   Although Haley had said late Thursday he thought the survivorswere taken to a St. Paul clinic, Flory said today they were stillaboard a fishing vessel that was en route to Dutch Harbor, on theAleutian Island of Unalaska. The vessel, the Bristol Enterprise,was expected to arrive sometime during the afternoon.   The rescued crew members were ``in relatively good shape,''Roberts said Thursday night. ``My understanding is only a couple ofpeople have minor injuries.''   He said 15 of those rescued, including the captain, are from theSeattle area. ``We are in the process of notifying the survivors'and the other crew members' families.''   Fair weather was reported in the area Thursday, with visibilityto seven miles, mild winds and seas to 6 feet, Haley said.   The Aleutian Enterprise is a factory trawler, a large vesselthat catches bottom fish, processes and freezes them on board.Trawlers normally fish for cod and pollock in the Bering Sea in theearly spring, Roberts said.   Most of the crew members likely are from Alaska, Washington andOregon, he said.   The vessel, about 10 years old and worth about $6 million, isowned by Aleutians Enterprise Ltd., a California-based partnershipthat contracts with Arctic Alaska for management and marketingservices, Roberts said.   Arctic Alaska's 22 other vessels that operate in the Bering Seacomprise the largest trawler fleet in the region, Roberts said.   In December 1988 the company lost a trawler in rough weather inthe Bering Sea. Two crew members died when the Arctic II sank,Roberts said.</TEXT></DOC>
