A spokesman for the pharmaceutical and consumer products company said the businesses are inconsistent with the company's overall strategic direction. He noted that unlike the U.S. and Canadian Scholl's foot care and health products operations, which Schering-Plough intends to retain, the international businesses are heavily involved with retail outlets and footwear items.    The international Scholl's business had sales last year of about $150 million, or 6% of Schering's 1986 sales of $2.4 billion. Schering-Plough said it doesn't expect the sale to materially affect earnings. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will assist in the sale. </TEXT></DOC>
