Bell Atlantic Corp.'s mobile systems unit is introducing a new generation of cellular telephones with a range of extra capabilities, but at no extra cost. The models can dial a number with a simple voice command. They also come equipped with a personal answering machine and can connect to portable fascimile machines and lap-top computers without additional equipment.    Other cellular operators will introduce similarly equipped telephones soon. South western Bell Corp. and BellSouth Corp. plan to enter the market in November.    Contel Corp. is also expected to do so; Contel officials couldn't be reached.    Justin Jaschke, vice president of corporate development at Pacific Telesis Group's cellular division, says the company expects to offer phones with similiar features within the next few months. Nynex Corp. plans to roll out high-tech cellular models in 1989.    &quot;This is a product that customers have been asking for,&quot; says Peter Taddeo, director of product management at Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems.    The new cellular phones are made by Audiovox Corp., based in Hauppauge, N.Y. Bell Atlantic and the other regional Bell companies are banned from manufacturing equipment by the consent decree that broke up American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in 1984.    There are about 1.6 million cellular users in the nation, with about 2,000 new customers signing up each day. By 1993, industry officials project a market of 10 million U.S. cellular customers.    Industry analysts believe the extra bells and whistles will give cellular companies a new marketing tool. But even more important, the new capabilities could help boost usage, and an analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. estimates the features could increase revenue at least 10% over the next two years.    Cellular operators have been looking for ways to cash in on telephone calls that are made when customers aren't in their cars. With an answering machine, the telephone call basically is always completed -- and the cellular customer is always billed.    Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems said its answering-machine feature will allow customers to record messages in their own voice and allow callers to key in their telephone numbers. When the customer returns to his car, the telephone number will flash on a display screen.    The fancy new telephones generally are expected to be in the same price range as older models. In fact, Mr. Taddeo says his company's new telephones are &quot;exactly the same price as the models they replace.&quot; The new cellular models, called CTX-1500, CTX-2500 and CTX-4000, range in price from about $1,200 to $1,500. </TEXT></DOC>
