Tippett, Ph.D, and M.D.andP;  (who is thefounder and president of FoundationWare) about the kinetics of computer virusreplication.andP;  Before I agree to take part in this event, I read the paper andbelieve that his work is valid and worth being disseminated to all of us whoare involved with computers.andM;While it is hard to recap the entire paper and the entire contents of theevent, the major points made were that we (as an industry) have been scanningfor known viruses and attempting to stop them beofre their &quot;trigger&quot; event(such as the Friday the 13th Virus).andP;  Dr. Tippett's assertion is that theseinterventions can be shown to be of minimal significance world-wide, or ofany institutional benefit.andP;  His contention is that other processes which canactually interfere with computer virus replication are more effective.andM;This does not mean that we should stop the scanning we all do now (we do allscan for viruses don't we?), but rather that in addition to these measures weadd security and microcomputer management practices to help stem the rate ofincrease of the viruses.andP;  According to his paper, even if no new viruses arecreated, the cost to the world-wide microcomputing community, to institutepreventative measures alone, is likely to exceed 1.5 billion dollars.andP;  Ifbroad scale preventative measures are not implemented, down time, disruptionof service, data recovery, and other costs are likely to exceed 5 billiondollars.andM;These numbers, alone, are enough to make you sit up and take notice.andO;However, when you get deeper into the report you find the really disturbingnews.andP;  For eample, Dr. Tippett examines three of the better known PC computerviruses that came into existence in 1987.andP;  These are: The Pakistani BrainVirus, Lehigh Virus, and the Jerusalem Virus (also known by the names of TSR,Israeli, and Friday the 13th Virus).andP;  These three represent the three classesof &quot;compiled&quot; executable viruses: Boot sector, operating system, andapplications (executable software).andM;In October 1989, IBM listed 31 unique DOS computer viruses.andP;  By the end of1989, using both the CVIA and FoundationWare lists, the number had grown to77 and one source reported 102 different and distinct types.andP;  It appears,from his research, that the rate pf appearance of new viruses isaccelerating, with new virus discoveries averaging more often than 2 to 4 permonth.andM;Dr.andP;  Tippett provides some assumptions in his paper that are the basis forhis conclusions.andP;  Since each virus is a computer program, and since computersare designed to run computer programs flawlessly, and since the hardware hasno inherent resistance to programs, a computer virus which is run on anoperating computer, as software, will indeed, load, execute, replicate andtrigger according to the code contained in the virus itself.andP;  He then getsinto this replication cycle which he likens to the spread of bacteria whichis essentially a binary process.andM;The paper gets into more detail than I want to relate to you here (I assumethat you can get a copy from FoundationWare (13110 Shaker Square Cleveland,OH 44120; 216-752-8181), but the long and short of it is that using theIsraeli Virus as an example, Dr. Tippett goes into the doubling time required(the time it takes a virus to double itself).andP;  In other words, if it startedon a single machine how long did it take to infect 2, then 4, then 8 etc.andO;Given the known time of discovery (October 1987), the known trigger date(October 13, 1989), and the number of machines that were affected by thisvirus (about 5000 worldwide), the paper calculates a duplication time of twomonths.andP;  Now he further takes into account the percentage of cases where thevirus is discovered and killed, and still comes up with this conclusion: Thenumber of computers infected with this virus will double each month and bythe end of 1992 th total number if systems infected will be over 4 millionsystems.andM;Another example Dr. Tippett used was the Arpanet Worm which infected andcompletely filled the memory of about 5000 networked computers in just under12 hours.andP;  In this case, the doubling rate was on the order of only one hour(this was also due to the fact that each of the machines was on the samenetwork making a nice, fertile environment for this doubling).andP;  Here is whereit gets really interesting.andP;  According to his figures, if a massive campaignwas organized to publicize the virus story and if free scanning software wasprovided to every computer user, and if this resulted in 75% of the virusesalready in existence being found and killed, the delay in the replicationswould be four months.andP;  In other words,within four months of the day that 75%of the viruses in existence was killed, we would be back to exactly the samenumber of computers being infected.andM;So What are We to Do?andM;If all of this is true then it is impossible to &quot;stamp&quot; out computer viruses.andO;Not really.andP;  The point that Dr. Tippett is making is that in addition toscanning for both viruses adn trigger events, improved microcomputersecurity, improved management thought, enforcement of software utilizationpolices, and training in good operating practices will help to blunt thisgrowth.andP;  Further, it will take a combination of all of these measures, aswell as others, to be able to stunt the growth of viruses world-wide.andM;FoundationWareandM;The company that Dr. Tippett founded and heads makes a software product whichhas been designed as a tool for first finding any viruses on a system, andsecond, managing each system to insure that no viruses are introduced intothe system.andP;  Dr. Tippett, however, does not claim that his software, initself, will prevent the above events from occurring, but rather his productis one of the measures that could be used to help fight this menace.andM;All-in-all it was an interesting session.andP;  I think that the members of thepress who attended left with a lot of good material and also became moreeducated about the threat of viruses to each and every computer we have ourimportant data and files stored on.andP;  Here at ASCII, we have so many newprograms and disks being loaded on so many different computers all of thetime that we are as careful as we can be.andP;  Yet from time to time we still runinto a virus, even after we have scanned the entire disk and scanned everynew disk we load information from.andP;  It is a constant battle (see my editorialin the August issue of 1989, Vol 8, No.andP;  1).andM;Viruses and ourandM;BBS SystemsandM;One of the ways we try to protect all of the users of our BBS system is toprovide a separate upload directory.andP;  When you upload a file we check it fortwo things.andP;  First, we scan each and every file for viruses and next we makesure that the file belongs on a BBS.andP;  By this I mean that if it is a piece ofsoftware it is already in the public domain, or a piece of shareware and nota commercial product being disseminated illegally.andP;  So far, we have not hadany problems with either of these, but we will keep checking each and everyoccurrence and only after it is checked will we release it for downloading bythe users.andM;While I am on the subject of our BBS systems, I should mention that we arenow posting the table of contents for each month's issue on the day we sendit to the printer (about one week before mailing).andP;  In addition, I usuallypick out one piece that I think will be of interest and we also post that onthe system.andP;  Obviously, we stay in business by selling subscriptions so wewon't be putting too much of the contents on the boards, but we will beadding &quot;what's new&quot; information as we get the time.andM;The questionnaires which are on the boards help us fund out what more we canprovide for our readers in the form of product reviews and discussions oftechnologies.andP;  We are always open to suggestions for improving ourpublications and hope that you will help make this a truly interactiveventure.andP;  We are arranging to have access to both systems via PC Pursuit.andO;(Yes, I know I cancelled my subscription some time ago--see Vol.andP;  7, No.andP;  10,but they do have a service where we can list our systems and they can beaccessed more cost effectively than via direct ATandamp;T or other direct dialservices.)andP;  If you have not tried our boards, I hope that you will do so.andO;The board running at our Santa Clara office is now available up to 9600 baudusing an HST compatible modem.andP;  (The access numbers are: 408-737-7862 inSanta Clara and 313-375-1771 for the board run by Peter Stevenson inMichigan.)andM;If you do call in, make sure that you have loaded ANSI.SYS in your set-up(CONFIG.SYS) file and enabled it within your communications software packageif you have a color monitor.andP;  This is the only way you can get a really goodimpression of the nice menuing system and other colorful options offered bythe Wildcat BBS software (Mustang Software 3125 19th Street, Suite 162,Bakersfield, CA 93301;805-395-0223).andP;  I found out the hard way that enablingANSI.SYS in my CONFIG.SYS file wasn't good enough to let me see the color.andP;  Ialso had to go into Mirror and tell it to operate in ANSI emulation mode.andO;CrossTalk requires the same type of set-up although Q-Modem does not seem torequire it.andP;  It the CONFIG.SYS file contains DEVICE=ANSI.SYS then Q-modemwill display colors.andP;  Anyway, check your own modem software to find out howto enable color and then come look at our rainbows.andM;Software AuditandM;Most corporations do not permit software piracy to take place within theircompanies.andP;  This is a true statement.andP;  However, many companies have no setmethod for checking to see if this rule is being followed.andP;  The SoftwarePublishers Association has undertaken some corporate software audits withexcellent results.andP;  The way this has worked in the past is that the SPA ispermitted to conduct a software audit of all of the hard disk drives within acompany and then to compare the programs found against that company'ssoftware purchase records.andP;  Any unauthorized copies of any software foundmust be destroyed, legitimate copies must be purchased, and a contribution tothe SPA Copyright Protection Fund must be made.andM;Sometimes the SPA has gotten involved in this type of audit in lieu oflitigation between a software vendor and a corporation.andP;  So far,organizations which have become &quot;software&quot; clean include three defensecontractors, a financial corporation, two insurance firms, a transportationcompany, two hospitals, an architecture firm, two components manufacturers,an advertising agency, a marketing company, and a food distributor.andM;The SPA has hired another full-time investigator to strengthen its audit andsoftware protection activities and plans to conduct more audits in 1990 thanit did in 1989.andP;  This month SPA also announced the availability of a Self-audit kit designed for use by corporate managers interested in conductingperiodic inventories of PC applications in use within their company.andP;  Thiskit is free for the asking and may be obtained by sending a written requeston company letterhead to: SPA Self-audit Kit, 1101 Connecticut Ave., NW,Suite 901, Washington, DC 20036.andM;This is just one of the ways in which the SPA has helped both its memberorganizations and the industry as a whole.andP;  Ken Walsch, the executivedirector of SPA, deserves the credit for what this organization has become.andO;He has taken it from a rather loose organization of smaller softwarecompanies to a major organization backed by most, if not all, of the softwarevendors in the industry.andP;  Their spring conference will have just ended in SanDiego by the time you read this so we will be presenting highlights for yourinformation next month.andM;Compaq and ????andM;I have to mention this item even though I know that there cannot be one ofyou out there who does not already know that Compaq and Businessland havegotten back together again.andP;  I could not believe that Businessland reallythought that giving up Compaq would not hurt business.andP;  After all, when youhave a name and reputation such as Compaq's, you have a sought after product.andM;At the time of the divorce, the rumors had Businessland refusing to carryEISA buss based products, Businessland insisting on a better discount thanother dealers, and almost everything else under the Sun (no, they don't carrySun Systems).andP;  Anyway, I am not really sure that any of us will ever know thefull story, only that it has a happy ending.andP;  Businesland is now back intothe fold and you can purchase your Compaq systems (and get support too) fromthe many Businessland locations throughout the country.andM;I think that Businessland needed Compaq more than Compaq needed Businessland,but I am glad that they are back together.andP;  Now, if only Businessland wouldstart paying some attention to smaller customers instead of pushing them offinto their ComputerCraft stores...Oh well, I guess they still do not believethat small companies ever grow up to become large companies.andP;  In San Jose, atleast, the differences between the stores and the type of knowledge exhibitedby the sales staff is vastly different.andM;PricesandM;No news to anybody, 286 prices are still coming down, 386SX prices are also,but more slowly due to the lack of SX chips in the pipeline.andP;  However, oncecompanies get the number of chips they have on order, I expect the SX pricesto come down still more and that the SX will fast become the &quot;box&quot; ofpreference for most buyers (especially when the 20 MHz models hit thestreets).andM;In line with this, AST recently announced lowered prices on the Premium/285and Bravo/286 desktop computers.andP;  Citing a Gallup poll survey which showsthat 44% of PC shipments in 1990 will be 286-based product, AST lowered thePremium price by 20 percent and the Bravo price from 8 to 15 percentdepending on the configuration.andP;  In the AST line the Premium is thefull-sized desktop unit with all of the slots and other options most vendorshave, while the Bravo is a trimmer, smaller, and equally fine 286 product butwith fewer slots and options.andM;IBM, in its recent product announcements (see page 20) also announced pricereductions ranging from 5 percent on the PS/2 model 30 to 12 percent on thePS/2 model 80.andP;  While it is not unusual for a company to reduce prices onolder products when announcing new systems, this price reduction is also aresult of increased price/performance pressures being felt throughout theindustry.andP;  According to all of the predictions, 1990 will be a lean year, yetaccording to hard data, IBM's PS/2 sales in January were up 29% over the sameperiod last year.andP;  Now that is a &quot;slump&quot; if I ever heard of one!andM;Tax SoftwareandM;Once again it is late for tax software, but once again the tax softwarecompanies have been late delivering product.andP;  After looking at several newentries this year, I still have to award the Aandgt;Prompt best of the categoryprize to Softview and the Macintosh product: MacInTax.andP;  Each year it justgets better and this yar they have added electronic filing to the package.andO;This is a quick and easy way to file your return and get your refund quicker.andM;All you do is fill out the forms on the screen, print them, fill out atransmittal form and forward them to a company called InstaTax in San Diego.andO;There is a $29.95 charge for this service but they also offer InstaRefundsfor an additional charge if you do not want to wait for your money.andP;  Thisyear only those who are due a refund may file electronically, and even thenit must be done by an authorized electronic filer.andP;  The IRS estimates thatmore than 3 million returns will be filed this way.andP;  What are the advantages?andO;Perhaps the biggest advantage is that you get your refund quicker, butanother benefit may be that your return gets entered into the IRS computersystem with fewer errors than those entered by hand by IRS input operators.andO;In fact, several organizations, including Money Magazine, claim that over 40%of the IRS audits and requests (demands) for more money from tax payers isdue to poor and incorrect data entry by IRS personnel.andM;Within a few years this form of electronic filing will be available to moreof us and the IRS estimates that by the mid-1990's over 40 million of us willbe filing this way.andP;  Oh, by the way, you still have to send in forms withsignatures on them for legal reasons.andM;Laptop ReportsandM;Since mailing out our laptop test issue last month I have received many phonecalls asking for additional information and also asking why we published thistest suite.andP;  It was published to try and provide a common ground for testingof portable computer products and it is the forerunner of a series of specialportable computer reports we will be generating during the next ninety days.andO;There will be three reports in the series.andP;  The first will deal with thetransportable and high-end laptop market, the next with mid- and low-rangelaptops, and the last with hand-helds, palmtops, and handheld organizers aswell as the communications issues facing the portable computer user.andM;These reports will be available individually or as a set and may be advanceordered (at a cost savings) anythimg between now and the publication date ofthe first one sometime i n early June.andP;  If you would like additional detailsand/or pricing, please contact us on our 800 number (800-678-0486) or viamail or fax at our business office address.andM;Hotel of the monthandM;This month I was in Washington D.C for FOSE and stayed at the Gran Hyatt inthat city.andP;  In my room I found two telephones, each with an RJ-11 jack(standard telephone type) built into its side with a label marked &quot;DataCom,&quot; I merely had to plug in my Compaq LTE/286 modem cable and away I went.andM;I wish all hotels had this type of modem connection.andP;  I was ablt to use thephone normally and yet access the modem anytime I needed it without having touse clip on cables, the MO FONE (see last month's column) or any of my othergadgets.andP;  We will add this one ot this BBS listing with four phones in frontof its name.andM;Speaking of Laptops, if the new Sharp PC-6220 Notebook PC measures up (oreven comes close) to its advance billing it will be a winner.andP;  The computeris said to be fully MS-DOS compatible, weighing just 4 pounds includingbattery, and with a VGA display!andM;The published specifications are as follows--andM;Weight: 4 pounds including battery.andM;CPU: 80286 running at 12 MHz.andM;Display: VGA triple supertwist, 10,&quot; black-and-white LCD display with 640 X480 resolution.andM;RAM: 1 MB expandable to 3.andM;Disks: 2.5&quot;, 20 MB hard drive, 23ms.andM;Software: MS-DOS 4.01 and Laplink in ROM.andM;Ports: Both serial and parallel.andM;Floopy drives are not included in the basic system, however, the modulardesign permits the transformation of the unit into a full-performance ATclass desktop.andP;  There are sockets for the following options: 3.5&quot; floppydrive (1.44 MB), two slot expansion unit, numeric keypad, VGA CRT adaptor,FAX/Data modem, a 3-battery charger, and &quot;slice&quot; add-on battery (increasebattery life up to 5 hours).andP;  Price: under $4000.andM;The product was announced at the Hanover fair and should cause quite a stirin the American marekt if it lives up to its claims.andP;  Here is what we know(and don't know) so far, in addition to the specifications listed above:andM;Dimensions are 1.4&quot; high X 8.5&quot; deep X 11&quot; wide.andP;  No mention was made in thepress information regarding the keyboard size, number of keys etc.andP;  Nomention was made of the battery life of the unit with the internal battery.andO;However, with the added &quot;slice&quot; battery, the time between charges goes up to5 hours and the weight up to around 6 pounds.andP;  The modem is not included inthe weight and the &quot;sockets&quot; referred to in the product release are foroptions and add-ons and have been designed to keep cable clutter down to aminimum.andM;I will be looking forward to getting this unit in the lab and running ourtests on it.andP;  We will be doing the Sharp unit, the new Grid unit and a fewothers in the coming weeks and will provide a comparison review as soon as wehave completed our tests.andM;Notes on the IIfxandM;There are several points that I did not make in the article on page 6 of thisissue regarding the new Apple products.andP;  First, the memory SIMMs used in theIIfx are, once again, different than those used in other Apple products, andsecondly, the upgrade board for the II and IIX do not include the DRAMneeded.andM;I am not sure why Apple continues to find new and different types of DRAM,nor am  I sure why others must also.andP;  We have several different types ofMacintoshes, a LaserWriter IINTX, and many different types of Intel PCs.andM;It used to be that we could just move memory from one to another.andP;  This madelife so simple.andP;  When we were working with a new machine it was an easymatter to add in more memory.andP;  Now, however, we have to have the memorydesigned for each system.andP;  The Compaq ram does not work in the AST systems(and, in fact, each AST system seems to use different SIMMs as well) and, ofcourse, the Macintosh SIMMs do not fit into anything else.andM;Apple has made it so that even the LaserWriter NTX takes different memorySIMMs.andP;  I guess that they just do not want us to be able to use all of the256K SIMMs lying around.andP;  I wonder how long it will be before we end up beingasked to donate them to someone who wants to build yet another breakwater,this time off the coast of Cupertino?andM;This entire SIMM thing is getting out of hand.andP;  I know that Compaq, AST, IBM,and Apple would like to sell us their own SIMMs (or those that they havebought and marked up) and that it makes some sense to make sure that theproper SIMMs are installed in the proper systems, but you guys are making itreally hard for corporate users to be able to upgrade systems.andP;  It takes somany different types of memory now that the time and effort involved incoordination adds considerably to the cost of the upgrade.andM;Apologies to John SculleyandM;John, I know how to spell your name.andP;  I have written it and read it enough tobe able to get it right.andP;  Somehow last month my dictionary did not catch it,my proof readers did not catch it, my Editor-in-Chief did not catch it, and Idid not catch it.andP;  But, since I mis-typed it myself, I cannot blame any ofthem.andP;  It is I who must take the sole blame and I can only promise not to doit again.andP;  I would offer to write your name 1000 times on a black board butsince I only use computers now I would merely write a little basic programsto replicate it 999 times after I typed it in once!andP;  Anyway, please accept mysincere apologies and please, please, tell your Advanced Technology Groupthat what is really needed is a keyboard that can spell...none of mine can!andM;Gassee Says GoodbyeandM;After a month of rumors and rallies by supporters, Jean-Louis Gassee made itofficial on March 2nd.andP;  He will resign and step down as President of AppleProducts.andP;  He intends to leave the company after &quot;an ordered transition ofhis responsibilities.&quot;andP;  John Sculley will have the engineering, networking,communications, and advanced technology efforts reporting directly to him.andM;Top management reporting directly to John Sculley in these areas are: EdwardBirss, Senior Vice President, Product Engineering; Donald P. Casey, VicePresident, Networking and Communications; and Larry G. Telser, VicePresident, Advanced Technology.andM;Farewell, Jean-Louis.andP;  Bon Chance.andP;  We know we will see you again...andP;  thisindustry needs people with your vision and drive.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
