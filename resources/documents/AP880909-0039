None of the commissioners objected to the proposed rules changeat a staff briefing Thursday, and NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr.said afterwards that he likely would take the staff'srecommendation and support it. A vote is scheduled for next Friday.   The proposal would allow Seabrook to receive a license toconduct tests at 5 percent power capacity without having a systemin place to notify residents within 10 miles of the reactor of anaccident.   ``It is highly unlikely that members of the general public wouldbe exposed to dangerous levels of radiation following an accidentat low power,'' the staff said in a 23-page report to thecommissioners.   The rule, if adopted, would allow the commission to reverse aFebruary ruling by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Boardthat blocked a low-power license after sirens were removed from theMassachusetts municipalities within the plant's 10-mile zone.   New Hampshire Yankee, the plant's operator, was forced to removethe sirens after a federal appeals court sided with state and localofficials. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and other plantopponents wanted the sirens removed because they believe noevacuation system can adequately protect nearby residents.   Under the new rule, New Hampshire Yankee still would need anotification system for a full-power license. The company hassuggested truck-mounted sirens and siren-equipped helicopters asreplacements.   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said in a telephoneinterview Thursday that the state probably would not try to blockthe rule change in court, but instead challenge the actual licenseif it is eventually issued.   After the siren issue, the only other low-power question pendingbefore the commission is an appeal by Seabrook critics that thereactor's bleak financial condition should block issuance of thepermit.   It is unclear when that issue will be decided and whether itwill hold up the oft-delayed license, said Martin G. Malsch, deputygeneral counsel for licensing and regulation at the commission.   Zech declined to comment on the potential impact of thefinancial qualification question.   ``We're taking one step at a time with Seabrook,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
