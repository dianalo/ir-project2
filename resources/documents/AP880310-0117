Foreigners in Lhasa said hundreds of people werearrested in the past six days.   The anniversary of the outbreak of the 1959 Tibetan uprisingagainst Chinese rule passed without major incident, said foreignersin Lhasa contacted by telephone from the southwest China city ofChengdu.   But more than 100 trucks carrying armed police drove through themain streets of the city of 150,000 in a show of force and severaldozen police with machine guns stood in front of the city's holiestBuddhist temple, the Jokhang, said Benjamin Watson of New YorkCity, a tourist.   Watson, who speaks Tibetan, said Tibetans estimated at least 300people had been arrested since a clash Saturday between police andTibetans demanding independence. Up to eight people were reportedkilled in the clashes.   The official news agency Xinhua also said the situation in Lhasatoday was normal. It said 100 top Tibetans gathered in Lhasa todenounce the riots and ``those who conduct evil doings under theguise of lama (monks).''   Another foreign traveler in Lhasa, who said she spoke someTibetan, said Tibetans had told her of a police sweep today on theJokhang Temple in which monks were arrested. She spoke on conditionof anonymity.   She said armed police were stationed at every corner of theBarkhor market square around the Jokhang, and there was norecurrence of Saturday's daylong battle between police and monk-ledTibetans.   March 10 is the 29th anniversary of a Tibetan revolt againstChinese rule that resulted in the flight of the Dalai Lama,spiritual leader of the Tibetans, and 100,000 followers, and abloody crackdown by the Chinese army.   A Nepalese-Tibetan interviewed today in the southwestern Chinacity of Chengdu, air gateway to Lhasa, said he had seen signs inLhasa written in Tibetan and posted before Saturday's disturbancecalling for people to rise up on March 10.   On that day in 1959, thousands of Tibetans surrounded theNorbulinka, the Dalai Lama's summer palace in Lhasa, after hearingrumors that their god-king would be kidnapped by the Chinese army.   On March 17 the Dalai Lama fled from the palace and led hisfollowers to exile in India. On March 20 the army attacked thepalace, and quashed the rebellion after three days of bloodyfighting.   In New Delhi today, about 200 Tibetan refugees clashed withpolice during a rally marking the anniversary of the abortiveuprising. Seven Tibetans and nine policemen were injured.   In a statement issued from his home in exile in Dharamsala,northern India, the Dalai Lama called on Tibetans to ``honor thecourage of our brethren in Tibet who have taken to the streets todraw attention to their suffering under Chinese colonial rule.''   China, which took control of Tibet in 1950, claims the mountainregion has been part of Chinese territory for seven centuries. ManyTibetans disagree, and hold deep antagonisms toward the Chinesebecause of the Communist government's past suppression of Tibetanlanguage, customs and religion.   Tibetans, led by monks from Lhasa's main monasteries, stagedthree pro-independence demonstrations last September and October,including a violent clash on Oct. 1 in which at least 14 died.   After those disturbances, Chinese authorities closed off somemonasteries and subjected monks to re-education campaigns.   There were no other major shows of resistance and authoritiesdecided to go ahead with the annual 10-day ``moinlam qenmo'' prayerfestival, one of Tibetan Buddhism's most important events.   The disturbances Saturday began on the final day of thefestival, when monks stood up at the Jokhang Temple, began shoutingpro-independence and pro-Dalai Lama slogans and throwing rocks atpolice.   Except for sporadic rock-throwing incidents on Sunday, Lhasa hasreportedly been calm since Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
