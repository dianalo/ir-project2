(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Parents accused of forcing their babyto drink acid seemed like average people, but apparently haddevised a scheme to collect money in a bogus product tamperingcase, an investigator said.   ``I've never seen a case that is as heinous or violent. It'sbeyond imagination,'' said Detective Johnie Phelps Jr.   Shelia Smith, 26, and Ricky Irby Sr., 27, have been charged withmurder in the death of Quinten Irby, who was 3 months old in 1984when he was taken to a hospital with acid burns in his mouth andthroat.   Associate Judge Harry Hartel Thursday ordered the parents heldin lieu of $1 million bond each. They are to be arraignedWedenesday.   Phelps, a 14-year veteran of the North Chicago PoliceDepartment, investigated the case and knew Smith and Irby casuallybecause they lived in the same neighborhood as Phelps' father.   ``They were just two average people, well known in theneighborhood, with good reputations,'' said Phelps. ``Ricky alwaysseemed to be a nice guy _ real personable.''   Neither had been in trouble with the law, he said, until a LakeCounty grand jury indicted them on murder charges Wednesday.   The parents said Quinten had ingested tainted baby formula, andhe lingered near death for more than two years, unable to eat,drink, speak or breathe on his own.   The baby died Aug. 26, 1986.   Irby filed a lawsuit in August 1987, charging negligence againstthe baby formula maker, Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago, andthe grocery store where he said the formula was bought.   Irby withdrew the lawsuit a year ago.   Phelps said money probably was the motive for the poisoning.   Both parents were unemployed. They never married and lived inseparate homes a few blocks apart in a neat, blue-collarneighborhood in this community of 47,000 on Lake Michigan.   Ms. Smith lived with her mother and the couple's 8-year-old son,Ricky Jr. Irby lived with his parents.   After Quinten was taken to the hospital May 31, 1984, testsrevealed that an open can of baby formula contained a large amountof acid, while an unopened can was uncontaminated, said Irby.   Prosecutors filed a petition alleging that Quinten was an abusedchild, said assistant state's attorney Matthew Chancey, but backedoff when much of the evidence _ cans of formula, a baby bottle andnipple _ were lost by the Illinois Department of Public Health.   A break came last November when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled inan Arizona case that evidence lost accidently does not barprosecution.</TEXT></DOC>
