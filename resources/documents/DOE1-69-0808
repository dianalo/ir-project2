These stresses can influence the isolationcapability of the salt dome if these stresses can initiate cracks orintroduce movements along existing closed flaws. The influence of thethermomechanical properties of the rock salt and the surrounding rockson the thermal stresses and the surface rise is discussed. This discussionis based on a number of finite element creep analyses of a homogeneouscylindrical salt dome. The parameters, varied in the analyses, are constantsin the thermomechanical constitutive behavior of salt and rocks, andfurthermore the thermal loading has been varied. It is shown that variationsin the creep properties, which result in differences in creep strainrate of a factor of 100, have only a very limited influence on the thermalstresses and the surface rise. Of more importance is the elastic stiffnessof the materials. In all creep analyses the thermal stresses in the saltare compressive and the shear stresses remain below 2 MPa. The resultsare evaluated using an analytical treatment. Based on this evaluation,it is shown that the observed trends in the numerical results have amore general character and are not strictly limited to the geometry chosen.It is concluded that the thermal stresses in the salt formation are notstrongly dependent on the creep properties of the rock salt.</TEXT></DOC>
