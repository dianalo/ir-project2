Witness the statements by Hong Kong officials that their message to Vietnamese is &quot;Do not come here,&quot; and that even before screening has begun, they estimate that barely 10% will be able to prove a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution.&quot;    Even if one assumes the effort to make meaningful distinctions is genuine, Mr. McGurn is right in saying that &quot;trying to separate the economic from the political in a totalitarian society is like trying to separate the blue from the sky.&quot; But he goes on to imply that totalitarianism is a primarily communist phenomenon, and suggests that the U.S. should return to its pre-1980 policy of conferring automatic refugee status on anyone fleeing communist countries. It's not, and we shouldn't.    The great majority of the world's 13 million refugees are indeed fleeing Marxist regimes. Mr. McGurn cites two of the largest -- 5.4 million Afghans in Pakistan and Iran, and 1.4 million Ethiopians in the Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti. But he also claims that 600,000 Mozambicans and 400,000 Angolans are all victims of communist oppression, when in fact, both groups are fleeing regional wars in which widespread brutalities have been committed by South African-backed rebel forces. In the case of Mozambicans, who actually number more than 1.2 million in six southern African countries, a recent study commissioned by the U.S. State Department indicates that at least 94% of the murders, rapes, looting and abductions reported by refugees were attributed to the rebel group, Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo.    The 300,000 Sudanese in Ethiopia, 180,000 Sri Lankan Tamils in India and Europe, and 140,000 Salvadorans in Honduras and Mexico, to name just a few, are not victims of communist totalitarianism, but they are refugees just the same. What responsibility does the U.S. have toward them?    Let's turn to a group right here at home. Since 1981, the U.S. Coast Guard has interdicted more than 12,000 Haitians trying to reach U.S. shores and returned them to their country. In seven years, only two people have been granted asylum. The rest were assumed to be economic migrants and sent back with no real opportunity to present their claims to refugee status. Haiti is a military dictatorship, plagued by crushing poverty, widespread political violence and human-rights abuses, and lacking even the most fundamental freedoms. Does Mr. McGurn's moral outrage extend to this group? Or would he compare them with, &quot;say, Mexicans who cross the U.S. border for work?&quot;    Hong Kong should not repeat the mistakes of the U.S., and it has made a very disturbing beginning. But it is the right of each nation to assess the claims of people seeking asylum at its borders. With that right goes the responsibility to see that all arrivals are given the opportunity to present their claims in a fair and impartial hearing, and that standards are clear and generous. Those who are screened out may not be refugees according to the United Nations definition, but they are still of international humanitarian concern and have the same rights as anyone else not to be forcibly returned to their country in such a way that their life or freedom would be threatened.    Hong Kong's screening policy may well be more dishonest than the push-back measures adopted by Thailand and Indonesia and threatened by Malaysia, but it is considerably more humane. Asylum countries in Southeast Asia are signaling that after 13 years of large refugee outflows, the status quo must change. The U.S. and the international community can ignore those signals and insist on no change, or we can protest the patent brutality of pushbacks at sea, while working to ameloriate, not condemn outright, the sorts of regional initiatives, such as screening, that at least keep the borders open and buy time to seek more lasting and satisfactory solutions for refugees.
