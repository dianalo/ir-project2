The study, analyzing data on almost 5,000 eighth-graders in theLos Angeles and San Diego areas, found that higher risks ofsubstance abuse occurred in two-parent as well as single-parenthouseholds and in affluent as well as poor homes.   The substance abuse showed up regardless of sports and churchinvolvment, watching television after school or spending time withfriends, said the study, published in this month's issue ofPediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, basedin suburban Elk Grove Village.   Adolescents who turn to alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana may be``manifesting a desire to display their sense of maturity andindependence,'' said the study, led by Jean Richardson of theUniversity of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles.   She and her colleagues suggested that the relationship betweenself-care and substance abuse may be partly due to the tendency totake risks that can result from being alone, having friends whosmoke or being in situations where cigarettes are offered.   Lillian M. Beard, a Washington, D.C., pediatrician, said in atelephone interview Wednesday that the findings were not surprising,``because young people ... whose energies are not directed,particularly during early adolescence, are at greater risk for notonly substance abuse but all kinds of risk-taking behavior,''including truancy, shoplifting and even joinging gangs.   Loraine Stern, a Los Angeles-area pediatrician and a member ofthe academy's communications committee, said, ``There is somethingintangible, especially during the adolescent years, about having ananchor.   ``And there's no doubt in my mind, from experience andphilosophically, that latchkey children are at greater risk not onlyfor substance abuse but for emotional difficulties,'' she said in atelephone interview Wednesday.   The study's findings support several recent articles that suggestsome types of problem behavior among early adolescents can belinked, at least partly, to large amounts of time spent withoutadult supervision, particularly after school, the authors said.   Researchers collected data by questionnaires given to 4,932youngsters in 47 public schools, and validated the findings withdata from 2,185 parents of the youngsters. All data were collectedin February 1987.   The researchers found that students in self-care for 11 or morehours per week after school were twice as likely to have consumed ahigh level of alcohol, 2.1 times more likely to have a highcigarette consumption and 1.7 times more likely to have smokedmarijuana than children who had adult supervision.   High alcohol consumption was defined as 11 or more drinks inone's life, and high cigarette consumption was defined as one ormore packs smoked.   The researchers said the number of U.S. latchkey children _ nowestimated at 2 million to 6 million _ is likely to rise, due to theincrease in the number of dual-career and single-parent families andthe decrease in traditional extended family arrangements.   They suggested developing more alternatives to self-care,including after-school programs at schools, libraries, recreationcenters, churches or other locations.</TEXT></DOC>
