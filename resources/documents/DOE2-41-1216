Themeasurement of the parity violating asymmetry is obtained by a comparisonof scattering for a + helicity beam to that for a - helicity beams. Topermit a meaningful comparison required that the + helicity and the -helicity beams being identical in all other respects. Measurements atdifferent energies and targets (hydrogen, deuterium) in the medium energyregion will allow to determine {alpha}, {beta} {gamma}, {delta}in a model-independentway. Regarding future experiments at the Mainz microtron cw accelerator,coincidence experiments will open new experimental possibilities forlarge solid angle detector systems. 5 refs.; 7 figs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
