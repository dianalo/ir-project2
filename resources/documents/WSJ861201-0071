InterTrade Management Corp., a Chicago-based trading concern, has developed a system that it says uses artificial intelligence. It already is offering a private fund for wealthy investors that uses the system, and it expects to offer a comparable public fund early next year.    Other companies are working toward similar goals, and the New York and American stock exchanges are studying possible uses of artificial intelligence to help their specialists improve pricing of stocks and options.    The experiments are still at a very early stage. The term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; covers a wide range of computer programs that mimic human behavior, such as the ability to learn from experience and make inferences. Programmers are far from fully harnessing the computer's power in this field, and their fledgling efforts could flop.    But if they succeed, artificial intelligence could give traders a powerful new tool to protect themselves from wild swings in the stock and futures markets.    &quot;The concept of utilizing artificial intelligence is acknowledged as the next major evolution in trading systems,&quot; says Frank Pusateri, a futures industry consultant who joined E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. this year as a vice president.    Systems based on artificial intelligence seek to anticipate market trends by identifying market signals that typically presage a change in prices. The computer then applies what it &quot;learns&quot; from historical trading data to the actual market conditions of that moment, and the system supposedly adjusts its trading rules and strategies in response to changes in market conditions.    Programmers have been slow to apply artificial intelligence to securities and futures trading because of the rapidly changing nature of the markets. It has tended to be used instead in activities with more stable data bases -- such as helping doctors to make medical diagnoses or oil-exploration specialists to find new oil fields.    InterTrade, a small futures money-management concern, has gone further than other companies in applying artificial intelligence to the futures market, according to Mr. Pusateri, who evaluated the company's new system this year.    Donald Knepp, 43 years old, a former cattle futures trader who has been working with artificial intelligence for three years, is president of InterTrade. He says the company's trading system makes nearly 300 measurements a day of price movements in six contracts to generate its own trading rules. It then compares current trading in each market with its data base and recommends a specific trade within 30 seconds. The system aims to predict price moves from one day to 24 days in advance.    Mr. Knepp says the system has averaged a 45% return annually in simulated trading since 1983 in stock-index, Treasury bond, foreign-currency and commodity futures markets.    A test of actual trading was less successful, as the system incurred losses in the past three months while trading with $80,000 of InterTrade's own funds.    But Mr. Knepp says he isn't discouraged. He wouldn't disclose the size of the losses, but he says most public commodity funds took larger losses over that period. He also says the test was distorted by the small amount of capital used, which didn't permit the exact diversification among markets recommended by the system. </TEXT></DOC>
