The court's decision Tuesday, widely reported in Israelinewspapers, marked the first time a court had ever overruled themilitary censors, who have broad discretion over publication of newsitems in Israel.   The disputed story in a weekly Tel Aviv newspaper, Ha'ir, did notgive the name of the Mossad head, which is never made public.   It indicated the man was responsible for several of the Mossad'srecent failures, such as the discovery in West Germany of falsepassports used by agents and events leading to the expulsion ofagents from Britain last year.   The report, to be published in Friday's edition of Ha'ir, saidthe director will be replaced in a matter of days.   The director was the first to have risen from within the agency'sranks. Israel radio said there are two candidates likely to succeedhim, including one Mossad official and one ``senior personality''from outside the organization.   The new appointment must be approved by Prime Minister YitzhakShamir and Finance Minister Shimon Peres _ the heads of Israel's twomain political blocs.   In overruling censorship on the story, the Supreme Court said thepress had a right to criticize public officials.   The court upheld censorship of any description of the Mossadchief, however, citing the man's personal safety.   Under Israeli law, military censors are empowered to banpublication of any news items deemed harmful to state security.</TEXT></DOC>
