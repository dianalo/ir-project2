Management negotiators headed by Tom Matthews, senior vicepresident for human resources, and Machinists negotiators led byDistrict 100 President Charles E. Bryan began meeting Friday morningbehind closed doors at a Key Largo, Fla., resort. No deadline hasbeen set. A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said hotelrooms have been reserved for two weeks.   Little progress was made in the first day of talks, sources said.   Chairman Walter Wallace of the National Mediation Board flew hereThursday from Washington to oversee the talks, which will continuedaily late into the night, unless Wallace and mediator HarryBickford decide the two sides are making no progress.   A federal declaration of an impasse would trigger a 30-daycooling-off period, after which the 8,500-member union could strikeand management would impose its own work conditions.   The principals promised to work for a settlement in the currenttalks.   ``Mediators are always optimistic, but we have a ways to go,''said Bickford, who's directed the mediation since Jan. 26. Mediationbegan then after the two sides' negotiations stalled.   Wallace's presence adds to the pressure on the negotiators tosettle. Such a high-level entry into the mediation usually wouldn'tcome until the 30-day cooling-off period.   ``He's here to add his expertise to the effort,'' Bickford toldThe Miami Herald.   ``As always, we want to avoid a work disruption,'' Bryan saidearlier.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said management wants asettlement, although Eastern executives have been lobbying formonths for declaration of an impasse. They say setting a 30-daydeadline will get the talks moving.   The two sides have been $200 million apart since July. TheMachinists' last offer called for a $50 million raise; the companyasked $150 million in wage concessions, mainly from thenon-mechanics such as baggage handlers and janitors who make upabout half the Machinists union.   Union leaders have suggested Eastern wants a strike so it can tryto break the union. But Eastern officials say they want to endpublic perceptions that the airline is beset by labor strife and geton with cost-cutting needed to reduce losses that totaled $233.7million for the first three quarters of 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
