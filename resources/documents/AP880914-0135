ROTHBERG</NOTE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis, under Republicanattack as weak on defense, came on like a hawk Wednesday, citing arange of weapons systems he supports and accusing his opponents ofa ``smoke and mirrors'' military policy.   ``We'll use force when it's necessary to protect our territory,our citizens or our vital interests, to meet our treaty commitmentsand to deter or to respond to terrorist attacks,'' the Democraticpresidential nominee said in a speech at Georgetown University.   Portrayed by Republicans George Bush and Dan Quayle as anopponent of most major weapons systems, Dukakis countered bydescribing the nation's military as suffering from years of neglectduring the Reagan administration.   Dukakis said there are shortages of tanks and anti-tank weaponsand carrier aircraft. And he said a backlog of undone essentialmaintenance work in the Army and Air Force ``is greater now than itwas when this administration took office.''   He also said there was a shortage of medical personnel.   Dukakis said he would press ahead with development of theAdvanced Tactical Fighter and the Sea Wolf attack submarine, ifelected. He also criticized the administration for decommissioning16 Navy frigates.   The Massachusetts governor said Democrats and Republicans alikehave ``the job of defending freedom'' and added:   ``George Bush unfortunately forgot that lesson last month whenhe persuaded the president to veto the defense bill over theobjections of the secretary of defense and the national securityadviser. Mr. Bush's pollster apparently had more influence thanthey did.''   President Reagan complained at the time that the bill cut toomuch into Star Wars funding and contained Democratic-writtenarms-control provisions.   In what has become a daily jab at the GOP vice presidentialnominee, Dukakis said, ``I'm not going to be looking for guidanceon national security issues from J. Danforth Quayle.''   Later, at an Annapolis, Md., rally before he headed home toBoston, the Democratic nominee taunted Bush for refusing to agreeto a debate originally scheduled for Wednesday night in theMaryland capital.   ``If George Bush isn't ready today after more than seven and ahalf years as vice president of this country, how can we expect himto be ready on January 20, 1989?'' Dukakis asked. ``Lloyd Bentsenand I are ready.''   He also took a poke at the vice president for the recentresignations of six campaign advisers on ethnic voters because ofallegations that they had pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic ties.   ``Maybe the reason George Bush won't come here to Annapolis(home of the U.S. Naval Academy) is that his idea of a navalexercise is throwing his campaign advisers overboard,'' Dukakissaid.   At Georgetown, the candidate was introduced by Rep. Les Aspin,D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who saidthe defense budget into the 1990s would be ``flat at best.'' Hesaid the next president would have to maintain a ``strong defensein the face of restrained dollars.''   Also seated on the stage was Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman ofthe Senate Armed Services Committee.   Responding to the Republican attacks, Dukakis said, ``We've hada lot of nonsense lately from Mr. Bush on the subject of nationaldefense.''   The Massachusetts governor said that the Trident II missileprogram and development of the Stealth bomber were started underDemocratic President Jimmy Carter.   He said that Reagan took office in 1981 with a promise to makeU.S. land-based missiles invulnerable to Soviet attack.   But he said that after ``eight years of Republicanmismanagement, our ICBMs are more vulnerable than they were in1980.''   ``It's time for an end to Republican smoke and mirrors onnational defense,'' he said, calling the MX missile, which heopposes, a ``sitting duck.''   Dukakis also opposes the proposed Midgetman missile, asingle-warhead weapon favored by some as an alternative to themulti-warhead MX.   But in this speech, he tempered his opposition to Midgetman,saying, ``The strategic concept of the Midegetman is sound, but Iquestion the value of spen            ding $40 billion or $50 billion for 500 additional land-basedmissile warheads _ at three times the cost of the same number ofnew submarine-based warheads.'' Both Aspin and Nunn support themissile.   While seeking to clarify his own position on Star Wars, thespace-based missile defense system being pushed by theadministration, Dukakis accused Bush of waffling.   ``I'm beinning to get the feeling that one of the reasons Mr.Bush is so reluctant to debate me is that he's so busy debatinghimself,'' he said. ``One day he wants to speed up SDI (StrategicDefense Initiative). The next day he does not.''   Dukakis, once counted a staunch opponent of SDI, has said hewould continue research and recently also said he would deploy itif it were deemed essential to the national interest.   At Georgetown he made no mention of deployment. Instead, hesaid, ``If we're going to make our defense dollars count, we've gotto stop pouring billions and billions into this program and do somehard thinking about what we're trying to achieve.''   He said that rather than scrap the Anti-Ballistic Missile treatyas some administration officials have suggested, ``I will protectAmerican security ... by insisting that the Soviets live up to itand that they dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar.'' Administrationofficials have called the radar a violation of the treaty. </TEXT></DOC>
