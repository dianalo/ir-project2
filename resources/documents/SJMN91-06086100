FORCE JUNE VOTE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The issue was forced to a vote when property owners who would pay about 10percent of the $708,000 to be raised next fiscal year filed written protests.The city can form a fire assessment district without voter approval ifprotests represent less than 5 percent of the amount to be raised.;   Unanimous vote;  The council voted 5-0 to put the issue on the ballot. Iflandowners representing 30 percent or more of the money to be raised hadprotested, the fire assessment district could not have been put to a vote.;   By forcing the issue to the ballot, protesters perhaps will make voters choosebetween fire protection and police protection services. The city councildecided last week, after a month of back-and-forth voting, to impose theutility tax without a vote of residents. The utility tax is a surcharge onelectricity, gas, telephone and cable television bills.;    Recall threat; Utility tax opponents opened the fire assessment district hearing Monday byannouncing they intend to try to recall the three city council members --Laurie Barke, Ray Bunt and Mayor John Sorci -- who voted for it.;    &quot;You tookaway our right to vote because you didn't think we'd support the utility tax,&quot;Shel Prince said.
