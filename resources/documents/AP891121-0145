Calls for Germany reunification by protesters in Leipzig addedstill another dimension to an already volatile and complicatedpolitical situation.   Premier Hans Modrow's new government said it was planning``unpopular measures'' to curb black-market currency trading, whichhas flourished since the borders with West Germany were opened Nov.9.   A statement by Modrow to workers at a Berlin factory, asreported by the official news agency ADN, did not make clearwhether there would be an attempt to reduce the number of EastGermans traveling to the West. More than 6 million have visitedWest Berlin or West Germany.   ``The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) cannot become acountry of currency speculators,'' Modrow said at the factory.   State television said later the new measures were customscontrols to be revealed after a government meeting Thursday. Theflood of visitors to the West has taken a huge amount of money outof the country, adding to East Germany's economic problems.   In Bonn, the West German government said East Germany hadrejected the idea of a joint fund to provide citizens with moneyfor travel to the West.   Although East Germans now enjoy freedom of travel unthinkableless than a year ago, and have been promised free elections,opposition leaders say that's not enough.   Increasingly, the criticism has been aimed at Krenz, in partbecause 77-year-old Erich Honecker, the man he replaced Oct. 18,had been his mentor.   Krenz, 52, has been dogged by a debate over whether he averted apotential massacre earlier in October by reversing Honecker'sorders to Leipzig police to shoot pro-democracy protesters ifnecessary.   Supporters say he did. Detractors say he reversed the ordersonly after being persuated by local party officials and churchleaders.   His support for China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstratorsin June has been another obstacle in Krenz's effort to win over adistrustful people. There also have been allegations that he tookpart in massive election fraud.   As Parliament weighs possible criminal charges against Honeckerand other members of his inner circle, reform groups emphasizeKrenz was part of that group. His promises of reform, oftenexpressed in careful generalities, have done little to change thatattitude.   Tuesday's editions of the official daily National-Zeitungreminded its readers the new party chief belonged to the``leadership body that is now in the cross-fire of criticism.''   ``Egon Krenz cannot make up lost ground'' unless he answers thecriticisms, it said in a commentary. ``The time of glasnost demandshonesty from everyone.''   State-run newspapers, which once hewed strictly to the partyleadership's line, have reported much more freely in recent weeks,but the National-Zeitung's criticism of Krenz was the harshest todate. ADN distributed the commentary after its publication.   The conservative, mass-circulation West German newspaper Bildsaid Krenz might be ousted in four weeks, which roughly coincideswith the party congress scheduled for Dec. 15-17.   Krenz has acknowledged that possibility. He told state TV overthe weekend: ``Naturally, I want to fight for the changes we'vemanaged so far, but if the party is of another opinion, then theyshould find another general secretary.''   A major question is whether a former model of party loyalty canlead East Germany through a crisis rooted in the flight of 275,000people from a nation of 16.5 million and the commitment to reformof millions who stayed home.   Opposition groups previously had expressed indifference, evenopposition, to calls from Bonn for German reunification, but someof that changed Monday night when protesters in Leipzig called out,``We are one people!'' and ``Germany a united fatherland!''   Whether that represents a major shift in position or not, WestGermans seized on the chants as growing support for a single Germanstate.   ``In the German Democratic Republic, the calls for areunification are growing ever louder,'' said Volker Ruehe, generalsecretary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party, the ChristianDemocrats. ``That's what the demonstration of hundreds of thousandsof people showed on Monday evening in Leipzig.''</TEXT></DOC>
