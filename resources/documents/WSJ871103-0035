Chen, a supercomputer designer who quit Cray Research Inc. recently to set up his own company, said he plans to develop a computer 100 times faster than any machine known today.    His concern, Supercomputer Systems Inc., disclosed few details of such a product, other than to say it would debut in the early 1990s and would &quot;help sustain the U.S. lead in science, engineering and applied technologies.&quot; The company, based here, said it is dedicated to making powerful, high-speed computers that are &quot;essential to the national interest.&quot;    Mr. Chen left Cray in September after it scrapped his latest design project, which it termed too costly and speculative. Mr. Chen was considering using lasers rather than wires in that machine. But while Cray granted Mr. Chen personal, nonexclusive use of his developments there, his new company said it doesn't intend to use Cray technology.    Supercomputer Systems said it would disclose financial details of its venture later. Mr. Chen's aborted project at Cray was said to have a cost of perhaps $100 million to complete. </TEXT></DOC>
