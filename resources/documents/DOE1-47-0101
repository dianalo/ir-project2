The Agency has completedan analysis of the potential population health risks and maximum individualexposures from ten disposal methods under three different hydrogeologicaland climatic settings. This paper briefly describes the general inputand analysis procedures used in the risk assessment for LLW disposaland presents their preliminary results. Some important lessons learnedfrom simulating LLW disposal under a large variety of methods and conditionsare identified.</TEXT></DOC>
