The economy, combined with the competition, is threatening twoof the city's tabloids.   The no-holds-barred New York Post, which has suffered losses foryears, says that the hemorrhaging must end and that it will shutdown with Saturday's edition unless its unions agree to more than$19 million in concessions.   At the money-losing Daily News, months-long labor negotiationsappear stalemated. Management has made extensive preparations for astrike. The unions continue working but are urging advertisers toboycott the paper.   ``There is an adequate market here for at least one (tabloid)paper, possibly two,'' said Ken Noble, a media analyst with PaineWebber.   Which would be fine for the two newspapers if New York Newsday,a third tabloid also losing money, did not have a profitableparent, the Times Mirror Co., patiently waiting for the market tosort itself out.   The city's fourth major daily, The New York Times, isprofitable, though less so than a year ago.   The Times also will seek concessions from the unions to theextent that they involve the same economic conditions that haveaffected the Post and News, said William Adler, a Times spokesman.   All four newspapers are suffering from an unofficial recessionslamming the Northeast that has retail advertising down.   The Post _ founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton _ has the worsteconomic problems. Three owners in the past two decades have lostmillions of dollars. Now its already slim ad linage is down.   ``They're the most likely to go out of business,'' Noble said.   On Sept. 4, Post Publisher Peter S. Kalikow told the paper'sunions that he was losing $27 million a year on the tabloid andthat he needed concessions from them of $17.4 million in payrolland $1.9 million in benefits.   He set an 8 p.m. Friday deadline for an agreement. Otherwise, hesaid the paper would report in its Saturday editions that it wasclosing and 960 employees would be out of work.   ``He did not want to read about the future of the New York Postin another newspaper,'' said Howard Rubenstein, a Post spokesman.   With headlines like ``READ MY LIPS: I LIED'' and ``UP YOURS!''to Saddam Hussein, and its all-time classic about a tavern killing_ ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' _ the Post strikes a chord thatsummons readers to newsstands. But its circulation is now about505,000, down from 900,000 in the past decade.   ``The New York Post has been very honest in coming to us withthis economic problem,'' said George McDonald, president of theAllied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group representing nineunions at the Post. ``We're going to do everything possible to helpthe Post stay in business.''   The News too is claiming losses _ $115 million from 1979 to 1989on revenues of $4 billion _ but also is trying to undo what it saysare archaic work rules that result in overstaffing on the pressesand among drivers.   In the last decade, its circulation has dropped about 700,000 to1,180,000.   The News has said it needs new color presses to replace its30-to 40-year-old equipment and stay competitive. While the unions,which represent about 3,000 workers, recognize the need for newpresses, they claim the News' parent, the Tribune Co. of Chicago,is out to break them in order to sell the paper.   Daily News unions point to the hiring of King and Ballow, aNashville, Tenn., law firm they say has a reputation forunion-busting; the hiring of replacement workers, and the trainingof management to run the presses if workers strike.   Management at the News has already told the unions that itexpects concessions equal to anything granted the Post. To put onthe pressure, the unions are urging advertisers to boycott the Newsuntil a settlement is reached.   ``It's a fight to the death over at the New York News rightnow,'' said Noble.   New York Newsday, meanwhile, has trucks ready to roll if theNews folds or goes on strike or if the Post expires, he said.Newsday, with its circulation of 225,000, ``would leap into thebreach. They sure would,'' Noble said.</TEXT></DOC>
