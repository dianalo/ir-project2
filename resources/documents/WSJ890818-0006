In a quarterly report to shareholders, John W. Atherton Jr., president and chief executive officer of the bank holding company, said he hopes to reduce City Federal's asset base to $9 billion by the end of the year. On June 30, he said, the bank had assets of $10.4 billion.    City Federal expects to reduce assets by selling mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage loans, he said, adding that the bank already has sold about $440 million of mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Atherton said those sales resulted in a &quot;modest gain.&quot;    Mr. Atherton said the bank might raise additional capital in various ways, including private or public offerings of preferred stock, subordinated debt or common equity. He said the company recently retained an investment banking firm to assist in the analysis of capital-raising options. </TEXT></DOC>
