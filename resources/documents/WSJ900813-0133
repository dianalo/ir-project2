Stemberg, chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Staples Inc., said he &quot;doesn't quarrel&quot;with analysts estimates that the company will post fiscalsecond-quarter operating profit of one to two cents a share.   A tax-loss carry-forward gain in the quarter ended July 28is expected to increase the per-share net income by one cent,Mr. Stemberg said in an interview.</LP><TEXT>   In the year-ago quarter, the company had net income of$72,000, or one cent a share, including a $24,000 tax-losscarryforward benefit.   Mr. Stemberg said he also is comfortable with projectionsby analysts that the company's second-quarter sales will bebetween $64 million and $64.5 million. That would be morethan a 70% rise in sales from the year-ago sales of $37.1million.   The company said it plans to report its second-quarterfinancial results on Aug. 15 or 16.   Staples, a four-year-old company that sells officeproducts exclusively, went public last April. The concernbuys merchandise in bulk, hence at relatively cheap prices,and passes on the discounts to customers.   Mr. Stemberg also said he wouldn't dispute analysts'estimates for the full year. &quot;To the extent that one can beaccountable for a company in the kind of growth that we findourselves in, income for the full year {before benefit from atax loss carry-forward} would probably be within an eye shotof the 55 cents to 56 cents per share analysts areestimating,&quot; Mr. Stemberg said. Annual sales estimates ofabout $312 million also wouldn't be far off the mark, headded.   For the year ended Jan. 27, 1990, Staples reportedoperating profit of $4.2 million, or 45 cents a share. Atax-loss carry-forward gain of $1.5 million, or 16 cents ashare, made net income $5.7 million, 61 cents a share. Saleswere $181.7 million.   Annual growth in stores opened for more than a year isexpected to decline in percentage points to the high teensoverall, down from the 33.6% recorded last year, the companysaid. Sales at stores in the second year of operations areexpected to grow by 30% or more, while sales growth at olderstores could slow to about 10%.   Mr. Stemberg attributed part of the slowdown to theretailer's strategy of saturating the market. As the companycontinues to dot the map with new store openings in onevicinity, sales growth at older stores in nearby towns drop,albeit &quot;at a surprising slower rate than anticipated,&quot; headded.   The flat economy in the Northeast, where most of thecompany's stores are concentrated, has helped the company'spaper products segment as a result of its low-price strategy,Mr. Stemberg said. But he noted that spending on items suchas furniture, fax machines and other large ticket items, hasslowed, though &quot;not significantly enough to fundamentallychange the firm's sales growth projections for the year.&quot;Approximately 75% of Staples sales come from smallbusinesses.   As a result of increased competition, Staples' margins forthe second quarter, particularly in Southern California,where it operates three stores, are below expectations, Mr.Stemberg said. However, the company &quot;has offset marginreductions by reducing operating expenses by an equal orderof magnitude,&quot; he added. Sales from its Southern Californiastores this year should represent less than 3% of thecompany's overall sales. That should increase to about 10% oftotal sales next year as the company plans to open 18 to 20new stores in the area.   Staples added that two &quot;new strategic moves&quot; should fuelgrowth in the coming months. The company has just opened a32,000-square-foot delivery distribution center in Putnam,Conn., across the street from its 136,000-square-footdistribution facility, he said. The additional space willquicken service along the Northeast corridor and help thecompany make good on its next-day guaranteed delivery oforders placed by telephone.   Also, in October, Staples, which mostly has outlets insuburbs, plans to open a 6,000-square foot Staples ExpressStore in Boston's financial district. The store will serve asa prototype for more than 30 stores slated for openings inother major cities, including New York, Philadelphia, andWashington, D.C., in the next several years.   Staples, which now operates 51 stores, plans to openanother 20 stores by the end of the year and an additional 30or more next year.   Some analysts have said that the company's aggressive planleaves little room for mistakes and predict profits will beslim. But Mr. Stemberg said the company is &quot;very proud of thekind of results it has achieved for investors {since it wentpublic last year} and comfortable and confident of our plansfor the future.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
