Even so, the mergers business will be far from stagnant, they say.    &quot;There will be less activity, but not drastically less unless the junk bond market is significantly hurt by the Boesky scandal,&quot; says Robert Pirie, president of Rothschild Inc., an investment banking concern. Hamilton James, head of mergers and acquisitions at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., predicts that 1987 will be &quot;less active in general,&quot; but says, &quot;I don't see the business falling off a cliff.&quot;    Many specialists say relatively low interest rates, readily available financing, more foreign involvement in the market and a laissez-faire antitrust environment will continue to stoke the merger fires. In fact, a Salomon Brothers report suggests that after a slow first quarter, this year's activity could even equal or surpass last year's.    But others see a more somber picture. They say that with the new tax law, the uncertain junk bond market and congressional threats to tighten regulations on takeovers, mergers will fall from last year's level.    In 1986, there was a record $267 billion of merger, acquisition, buyout and divestiture activity, according to Laszlo Birinyi, vice president of Salomon Brothers. That compares with $235 billion in 1985, Mr. Birinyi said.    &quot;I'd say there will be a falling off in business in 1987, but in the 10% to 20% area,&quot; says Daniel J. Good, managing director and head of merchant banking at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Few in the field expect the new tax law to come close to halting takeover activity. Under the new law, companies will pay higher taxes on profits from divestitures, and shareholders will pay higher taxes on profits from takeovers. Furthermore, the repeal of the General Utilities rule means that companies doing the acquiring will no longer, for tax purposes, be able to mark up the price of assets they buy and then depreciate them based on the higher price.    &quot;The tax changes are just an additional cost of doing business,&quot; Mr. Good says. &quot;If you have higher costs, you might have lower sale prices, but transactions will still occur at a very heavy pace.&quot;    The specialists disagree about how the rush to complete transactions by the end of 1986 for tax purposes will affect the mergers business this year. More than $75 billion of such transactions were announced last September, October and November alone. Some say many fourth-quarter 1986 transactions were &quot;borrowed&quot; from 1987 and that the result will be a desultory first quarter, or perhaps first half. Others, however, said some of the accords announced in 1986 wouldn't be completed by the end of the year.    Although tax overhaul had a dramatic impact on mergers and acquisitions last year, Wall Street assimilated it without major upheaval. That may not be true of the insider-trading scandals. Last May, when Dennis Levine, a senior member of the mergers and acquisitions department at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., was charged with insider trading, people in the business began waiting nervously for other shoes to drop -- which they did, again and again.    The fall of Ivan Boesky and the news that Drexel Burnham, the leading underwriter of junk bonds and an investment banker for Mr. Boesky, was the target of a federal investigation, cast a pall over Wall Street that many believe will last well into 1987. Of the $69.5 billion in junk bonds, or high-yield, low-rated debt securities, that have been issued in recent years, two-thirds to three-quarters have been used to finance mergers and acquisitions, according to a Salomon Brothers report. Late last year, several proposed takeovers were scratched in the wake of the Boesky affair.    In the short term, serious problems in the junk bond market could make it difficult for many companies to raise the capital needed for an acquisition. But specialists agree that in the longer term, other issuers will fill the vacuum.    &quot;What happens at Drexel won't make any difference,&quot; says Eric Gleacher, head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;Others will step in and take up the slack. There's too much money around and too much money to be made.&quot;    Mr. Gleacher says the takeover climate in 1987 will be most influenced by Washington. &quot;The backlash from the scandal is likely to bring some kind of regulatory change,&quot; he says. &quot;The swing factor in '87 will be D.C.&quot;    Although Congress has considered a number of bills restricting takeover activity in recent years, no major changes have been legislated. But Congress has never before had such provocation. Late last year, Sen. Alphonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) told a Securities Industry Association meeting that he would introduce legislation to ban &quot;greenmail&quot; and penalize securities firms whose employees are found guilty of insider trading. And under the new leadership of Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.), Mr. D'Amato said, the Senate Banking Committee will become more active on takeover issues.    Regulatory bodies were relatively inactive in takeover matters last year. Although the Federal Reserve Board adopted a rule that restricted some companies from financing more than 50% of a takeover with junk bonds, raiders learned to sidestep it.    The Securities and Exchange Commission asked Congress for only one change in tender-offer law: requiring buyers of 5% of a company's stock to disclose their stake within two business days rather than the current 10 days. The proposal was never even considered by Congress. But the SEC itself adopted a so-called all-holders rule, which prohibits both bidders and targets from excluding any stockholders from a tender offer.    The courts, however, made some significant decisions affecting mergers and acquisitions. The Delaware Supreme Court placed limits on the ability of companies to favor certain bidders once directors have decided to sell a company. Two other courts, in suits involving Fruehauf Corp. and NL Industries Inc., similarly ruled that once a company puts itself up for sale, it must encourage bids and accept the highest offer, even if the offer comes from a suitor unpalatable to management and directors.    The takeover business also was transformed last year by the increased willingness of investment bankers to put their own money into clients' transactions in the form of bridge loans. Most in the business expect to see more of that so-called merchant banking this year. The advantage for clients is the speed with which money can be raised. For investment bankers, bridge financing is a way to attract clients who may once have turned instead to Drexel's junk bond operation.    Foreign involvement in U.S. mergers and acquisitions is expected to rise this year. British and some other European concerns already have been active here, says David Kay, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham, and &quot;they're probably going to continue to be strong, maybe even stronger than in the past, because of the strength of their currencies.&quot;    Many say Japan also will start to get involved in U.S. takeovers. &quot;They have a lot of capital, and everybody thinks it's going to come this way,&quot; Mr. Kay says. &quot;The question is when.&quot;    Last year was another active year for stock buybacks, and some in the field believe that activity will continue in 1987. Charles Plohn Jr., managing director of special equity transactions at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., says stock buybacks that are &quot;related to getting rid of large unwanted shareholders&quot; may level off. But, he says, if interest rates continue to come down, managements may see buybacks as the best use of their cash. &quot;Managements have been extremely bullish on their own companies,&quot; Mr. Plohn says.    ---   BILLION-DOLLAR DEALS CLOSED IN 1986                                       Transaction   Value                                         Type        (in Buyer              Seller                         billions) General Electric   RCA               Acquisition   $6.40 Kohlberg Kravis                      Leveraged Roberts            Beatrice          buyout         6.20 Kohlberg Kravis    Safeway           Leveraged Roberts            Stores            buyout         5.30 Burroughs          Sperry            Acquisition    4.80 Management/                          Leveraged investor group     R.H.
