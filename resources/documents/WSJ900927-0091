Finance Minister Michael Wilson told the House of Commonsyesterday that businessmen are saying there will be &quot;chaos&quot;if the tax is scrapped.</LP><TEXT>   Sears Canada Inc., a Canadian subsidiary of Sears, Roebuckandamp; Co., said it has ordered 3.5 million copies of its springcatalog with prices based on the proposed tax taking effectJan. 1, as planned by the government. It has also purchasedabout 1,000 new cash registers and reprogrammed otherequipment to cope with the levy.   Coinamatic Group, which operates 70,000 coin-activatedlaundry machines, said it has been converting its equipmentto take more quarters to cover the cost of the new tax. Butthe company has suspended plans to raise its prices to coverthe cost of the value-added tax, pending the outcome of thelegislative battle, said Richard Adamson, the company'sfinancial vice president.   The proposed tax was approved by the House of Commons lastApril, but has encountered strong resistance from theopposition Liberal Party in the Senate, an appointed chamber.The Liberals hold 52 of the 104 Senate seats.   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the Liberals arethreatening to undermine Canadian democracy, by frustrating&quot;the will of the duly elected representatives of the people,&quot;in the House of Commons.   To try to get the tax bill through the Senate, hethreatened to use for the first time in Canadian history anexceptional constitutional power that allows the governmentto appoint eight additional senators.   Such action would require the approval of Queen Elizabeth,the British monarch who is Canada's titular head of state.Buckingham Palace officials told the Canadian BroadcastingCorp. that the Queen would approve the appointment ofadditional senators if her approval was requested.   Businesses, on government instruction, have beencollecting the proposed goods and services tax since Sept. 1on any transactions that include 1991 business. The NationalArts Centre in Ottawa said that if the tax bill is defeatedit will have to reimburse customers who have paid the tax ontickets for 1991 productions. &quot;We're waiting like everybodyelse to see if the tax is adopted,&quot; said box office managerRobert Cousineau. &quot;It is a bit stressful.&quot;   The new tax, which is to cover most goods and services,was designed to replace an outmoded 13.5% tax that is appliedat the manufacturers' level on a narrower range of products.   Manufacturers of some products, including autos, have saidtheir prices will decline if the tax change occurs. Toencourage car buyers to purchase now instead of waiting forthe proposed tax change, Mercedes-Benz Canada Inc. isoffering a 3.5% price cut until Dec. 31.   The uncertainty about the tax has been heightened by theplans of the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia tofight the proposed tax in the courts. The two provinces claimthe proposed tax is unconstitutional and infringes onprovincial rights. British Columbia also has threatened tochallenge in the court any move by the government to appointnew government supporters to the Senate to get the tax billpassed.</TEXT></DOC>
