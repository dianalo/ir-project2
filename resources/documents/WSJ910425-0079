When the head of Germany's central bankcalled his government's reunification program a &quot;disaster&quot;last month, the mark skidded to a 12-month low against thedollar. But there is another economist whose words and deedsaffect Germany even more than Mr. Poehl's. His name is LudwigErhard, and he spooks markets even from the grave.   Erhard was the planner who brought Germany success thelast time it faced a major economic challenge, in 1948. Underhis leadership, Germany moved so quickly from a nation ofhungry folks who spent their days queuing for rations to apack of Mercedes drivers that the transition came to be knownas Germany's Economic Miracle. When Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sgovernment inaugurated its program to absorb the East Germaneconomy last summer, its spokesmen waved bound aquamarinevolumes of Erhard's prose in the air and talked of a &quot;anothermiracle.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Nine months later, the Germans face a weakening currency,an expanding money supply, elevated interest rates andunemployed workers marching by the tens of thousands in thestreets. Instead of a 1950s-style boom, the panickers argue,Germany may now get a 1930s-style depression. Discussionrages on whether the new Germany is &quot;living up to Erhard.&quot;   &quot;We have no Erhard now, that is the problem,&quot; says RolandLeuschel, the gloomy chief strategist of Banque BruxellesLambert, in neighboring Belgium. He wonders whether Germansfrom the East are capable of working an Economic Miracle.Norbert Walter, economist at Deutsche Bank, is moreoptimistic. &quot;The Economic Miracle wasn't perceived as such in1948, or even 1951. This time the `miracle' starts in 1993and is perceived in 1995.&quot;   To understand the weight of the Erhard legacy, it helps tocompare Erhard's policies with those of the Kohl government.In June 1948 Erhard replaced the old, inflated Reichsmarkwith the new Deutsche mark. He also lifted price controls,worked to cut high taxes, and began a series ofsupply-side-oriented measures to help business in a Germanydevastated by war.   Germans brightened fast. &quot;Reich's Recovery&quot; read apage-one headline that ran in this newspaper on July 28 ofthat year. &quot;Price controls and rationing have been lifted onmost things,&quot; reporter Joseph E. Evans wrote. &quot;This caused alot of grumbling and a lot of firing among the Germanbureaucrats who formerly did the controlling and therationing, but it's welcomed by people generally. Eggs andall fresh fruits and vegetables are among the essentials thathave been decontrolled.&quot;   Chancellor Kohl's government has also launched its programwith a currency-reform: A 1-to-1 conversion rate last summerrid all of Germany of worthless East German marks. But Mr.Kohl's coalition government did not follow that step withsignificant measures to improve the business climate ineither half of Germany. Mr. Poehl's problems with the Kohlgovernment in part involve the separate -- if important --issue of central bank independence. Voters have a secondcomplaint: After a Bush-style promise of &quot;no new taxes,&quot; thechancellor put through a one-year income tax surcharge of7.5% and an increase in the value-added tax to start nextyear. A cut in Germany's onerous corporate tax rate waspostponed.   &quot;We should have cut taxes,&quot; says Mr. Walter. &quot;Instead weraised them. That's in contrast to Erhard.&quot; Mr. Leuschel forhis part notes that the Free Democrats, partners ingovernment with Mr. Kohl, had pushed for what could beinterpreted as an Erhard-style gesture: making EasternGermany a lower-tax zone. &quot;But what happened to that?Forgotten.&quot;   To some degree, of course, circumstances today differ fromthose of 1948 West Germany. In 1948, the conversion rate wasless generous -- &quot;1-to-1&quot; held for the first 60 marks; onlythen, with some exceptions, the rate switched to 10 to 1. In1990, as the disgruntled Mr. Poehl has enjoyed pointing out,1:1 applied up to 4,000 marks, then became 2:1. Property isalso a problem these days. After the war, West Germany hadonly one problem regarding ownership of property -- thequestion of property confiscated by the Nazis. Now, theall-German government must resolve some 1.2 millionoften-conflicting property claims involving the Nazi period,the Soviet occupation, and the communist reign in EastGermany.   The most telling difference, though, is perhaps one ofsimple political bravery. In a month when the Allies stillran Germany, Erhard freed prices without seeking approval(although there is evidence that Lucius Clay, the relevantgeneral, supported him and winked at this disobedience).Konrad Adenauer, West Germany's first chancellor, was electedby a majority of only one vote. Nevertheless, with Erhard ashis economics minister, he worked to help business (&quot;this taxreduction]&quot; fumed opposition leader Kurt Schumacher inParliament). When much of the rest of West Europe -- mostnotably Britain -- was busy nationalizing, Erhard dismissed&quot;Keynesian dogma&quot; and &quot;the economics of planning&quot; with a waveof his cigar.   To be sure, Erhard was no pure supplysider. He advocatedwhat he called a &quot;social market economy.&quot; But his prioritywas the marketplace. It was only at the start of his secondterm, in 1953, that he and Adenauer began major work onGermany's substantial social-welfare net.   Mr. Kohl has not been so courageous. Despite unexpectedlystrong support from Eastern voters for his party, theChristian Democratic Union, and a new internationalreputation as Germany's &quot;unity chancellor,&quot; Mr. Kohl has madeit his business to cater to opinion polls minute by minute,rather than work long-term change.   Public-sector aid to East Germany this past year has addedup to some $65 billion. To privatize East Germany's commandeconomy, the German government last year created an agencyknown as the &quot;Treuhandanstalt.&quot; Much of the Treuhand's&quot;portfolio is worthless. But German officials have beenreluctant to face the political cost of acknowledging this.As a result the agency faces the same predictable problems asthe Resolution Trust Corporation, which is in charge ofselling the savings and loans in the U.S. Of the 8,000 firmsthe &quot;Treuhand&quot; inherited from communist East Germany, it hasbeen able to unload only 700. (The assassination Monday of&quot;Treuhand&quot; chief Detlev Rohwedder by terrorists will onlyslow things further.)   Happier news tends to come from companies willing to makea completely fresh start. It's useful here to compare theprogress of the three big West German banks on the Easternfrontier. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, numbers one andtwo, took over the old East German bank, the Staatsbank,moving into its buildings and hiring many of its employees. Athird bank, Commerzbank, started fresh, setting up branchesin mobile homes and importing much of its starter staff fromthe West. The result: Commerzbank's employee-to-customerratio is 1:187; Dresdner Bank's is 1:109; Deutsche Bank's is1:55.   Those who imagined that big brother West Germany could buyEast Germany another Economic Miracle are being disappointed.Only 16 months ago Easterners were demonstrating for Germanunity by the thousands on Leipzig's streets. Now, the samestreets are lined with thousands shouting &quot;Kohl must go&quot; anddemanding job guarantees.   Mr. Leuschel of Banque Bruxelles Lambert says Germans justaren't the hardworking savers they used to be. &quot;Erhard wasfor moderation. And Germany used the Marshall Plan forinvestment, not spending. Where is that moderation now? Whatare all the Easterners doing with the first cash they get?They are buying Mercedes.&quot; It is true Eastern Germans arebuying cars -- but Germans 40 years ago also lunged forconsumer goods. Mr. Walter of Deutsche Bank argues thatErhard's model can still serve Germany. &quot;There's no reasonthat -- in the right circumstances -- Eastern Germans can'trepeat the Economic Miracle. They are the same people.&quot;   Indeed, Eastern Germans -- just like any people -- mightmake more progress if given a better chance to grow. &quot;Themarket is the only fair, democratic judge,&quot; Erhard said.   ---   Miss Shlaes, deputy features editor of The Wall StreetJournal's editorial page, is the author of &quot;Germany: TheEmpire Within,&quot; just out from Farrar, Straus.</TEXT></DOC>
