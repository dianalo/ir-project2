He said his government was determined to stop the wave ofradical protest that has battered South Korea in recent weeks, buthe did not outline specific action in a televised speech to thenation.   ``If violence and illegal acts endanger democracy and the futureof the country, I would be obliged to invoke emergency measures asempowered by the constitution,'' he said.   South Korea's constitution permits the president to rule bydecree or impose martial law in cases of emergency.   Radical students are trying to bring down Roh's government andhave forrmed alliances with striking workers. They are a powerfulminority on campuses, but lack public support because of theirextremism and violent tactics.   Roh's warning responded to the killing of six riot troopersearly Wednesday at Dongui University in Pusan, a southernstronghold of the opposition.   People seldom are killed in South Korean protests. Riot officerswear protective helmets and shields, along with fireproof fatigues,and normally are armed only with tear gas and batons.   The six who died were set afire when they broke into a room onthe seventh floor of the university library to free five comradesheld hostage. They were the first policemen killed since a riotofficer died in June 1987.   Authorities said students seized the hostages Tuesday after aviolent demonstration against the firing of warning shots by policeon Monday when protesters menaced a police station.   Students hurled firebombs and set fire to a barricade drenchedwith paint thinner as the policemen were climbing over it. Someofficers wrapped in flames jumped out of windows and others wereburned to death or asphyxiated, police said.   Ten officers were in critical condition and police said theyexpected more to die. Officials said about 10 other policemen andstudents suffered minor injuries.   About 700 police raided the school, firing tear gas.Eighty-eight arrests were reported and the hostages later werefreed unharmed.   Jo Jong-suk, chief of the national police, resigned after about150 officers in Pusan conducted a sit-down protest and accusedsenior officers of mishandling the assault. His office said it wasthe worst loss of police life in recent years.   The Education Ministry ordered the Dongui campus closedindefinitely.   Roh said in his speech Wednesday: ``It has become clear that,behind the flames that took the lives of young people, there arerevolutionary groups which resort to violence to achieve theirgoals.''   He said the government was prepared to crush radical groups andhalt what he called the use of universities and factories asrevolutionary bases. ``It is time for us to make a firm resolutionto mobilize whatever means to get rid of violence in this society.''   Opposition leaders also denounced violence and urged studentsand workers to end their protests.   News reports Wednesday said the U.S. Cultural Center in theprovincial city of Kwangju, a frequent target of radical students,would be closed temporarily and moved to a location as yetundetermined.   Police said they expected more violence in Masan, astrike-ridden industrial city near Pusan where militant laborgroups scheduled a huge rally for Thursday. Thousands of workers inthe city held violent protests all last week.   Officials said about 7,000 riot policemen were being assembledin Masan and nearby Changwon. News reports said police set upbarricades Wednesday outside Masan and made arrests.   About 3,800 officers have been injured this year by firebombs,rocks, clubs and iron bars, police said. Police and governmentofficials are seeking laws to provide tough punishment for users offirebombs.</TEXT></DOC>
