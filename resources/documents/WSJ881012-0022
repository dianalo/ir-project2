Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR </IN><G> SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder called on corporate managers to change the way they treat institutional investors, and on those investors to change the way they behave in the markets.    &quot;I believe institutional investors should review their market objectives and abandon their short-term time horizons,&quot; he said in remarks prepared for a speech in Chicago to corporate lawyers. &quot;Institutional investors must recognize the new era by behaving responsibly as corporate owners and as market participants. Corporate managers in turn should exhibit greater sensitivity towards institutional shareholder interests.&quot;    Several times over the past year, the SEC chairman has touched on his concerns about the increasingly powerful role of institutional investors. He repeatedly has said that pension funds and institutional investors shouldn't take too &quot;short range&quot; a view of the markets. But until yesterday, he hadn't linked the trading behavior of institutions to the way corporations are managed. Nor had he said that managers must reconsider the way they deal with institutional investors.    When pursued by gigantic pension funds, Mr. Ruder argued, short-term investment strategies not only can disrupt the stock market, but also can affect the way companies are run. &quot;The message {such strategies} give to corporate managers is that they in turn should manage by short-term rather than long-term objectives,&quot; he said.    Noting the increasingly active role institutions have begun taking in proxy fights and takeover battles, Mr. Ruder said management should recognize that &quot;profound changes&quot; are occurring and respond to them &quot;constructively.&quot; If managers do respond to the desires of institutional shareholders, he said, then they both &quot;will avoid charges that they are accountable to no one&quot; and might find that institutions begin behaving more like &quot;long-term owners.&quot;    Mr. Ruder's speech was permeated by skepticism about the trading strategies some institutions are following. While many institutions gave up such gambits as portfolio insurance in the wake of last October's crash, he said, some continue to trade in a fashion that is &quot;potentially disruptive.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
