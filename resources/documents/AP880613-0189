He presented his findings at the Fourth InternationalConference on AIDS in Stockholm.   In a study of hemophiliacs, Goedert found that condoms don'tprotect against AIDS unless they are always used during sexualrelations. ``Irregular condom use is no better than no condom atall,'' he said.   Dr. James Curran of the Centers for Diease Control in Atlantareported that new AIDS cases are reported in the United States atthe rate of one every 14 minutes.   He estimated 365,000 cases will have been reported in the UnitedStates by 1992 but said the figure could range between 205,000 and440,000.   The AIDS conference here is the largest meeting ever held on thesubject of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, with more than7,000 participants.   Also Monday:   _Jean-Baptiste Brunet of Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris saidthe number of AIDS cases reported in Europe has reached 12,221 andis doubling every 11 months.   The incidence of AIDS in drug abusers is exploding in Spain,France and Italy, he said. In 1985, 7 percent of Europe's AIDScases were in drug abusers. Now the figure is 30 percent. Anestimated 300,000 to 800,000 people in 30 European countries areinfected with the AIDS virus, Brunet said.   _Australian researchers described six cases in which mothers whobecame infected after birth passed the virus to their infantsthrough breast milk.   _An early report from an expanding U.S. government study ofAmerican hospital patients said that three in every 1,000 patientstested at six U.S. hospitals are infected with the AIDS virus _ butthe spread of the AIDS virus appears to be slowing.   Curran said it is difficult to tell if the AIDS epidemic isbeginning to level off but said he didn't consider that animportant question.   ``We had a thousand cases reported in the United States lastweek,'' he said in an interview. ``Does it matter whether it'sgoing up or not? It might level off like lung cancer or heartdisease _ and that's not good.''   A 1986 estimate that 1 million to 1{ million Americans wereinfected with the AIDS virus was probably too high then, Curransaid. ``We believe an estimate of 1 million to 1{ million infectedis accurate now,'' he said.   Goedert's conclusions about the growing infectiousness of peoplecarrying the AIDS virus came from a study of the rate at whichinfected hemophiliacs transmitted the AIDS virus to their wives orsteady female partners.   In the first year of the hemophiliacs' infection, only 1 percentof the partners became infected.   By the fourth year, the rate of transmission began to increaseand by the fifth year, 10 percent to 20 percent of the women werebecoming infected each year, Goedert said.   ``There is a steeply increasing risk of becoming infected inlong-term relationships,'' Goedert said.   ``The more partners, the more the risk,'' Goedert said.   Curran said that the transmission of AIDS among heterosexualswill continue to grow.   ``More and more women are acquiring the disease throughheterosexual contact,'' he said.   ``The data are too incomplete for firm conclusions,'' he said,but ``heterosexual transmission will be increasingly important _without explosive increases, as we're seeing in IV (intravenous)drug abusers and gay men in the United States.''   Goedert said that a person infected with the AIDS virus becomesmore able to transmit it when the disease progresses to the pointwhere laboratory tests reveal an immune system deficiency _ eventhough there may be no visible symptoms.   Dr. Robert Redfield of the Walter Reed Institute of Research inWashington said that the gradual spread of AIDS to heterosexuals isbeing accompanied by another unfortunate trend.   ``We have mounting evidence that the virus is steadily creepinginto the young people,'' he said.   Among 17-year-old applicants to the armed forces, women aretwice as likely to be infected as men, suggesting that the womenacquired the infection from heterosexual contact with older men, hesaid.   About 60 percent of the nation's approximately 18,000hemophiliacs are now infected with the AIDS virus, Goedert said.   Curran said the best available evidence now is that 40 percentof people infected with the virus will develop AIDS within nineyears after becoming infected, and the rate at which they developAIDS is likely to climb as even more time goes by.   AIDS is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immunesystem, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infectionsand cancers.   The World Health Organization reported in April, 1988, thatthere were 88,031 AIDS cases reported worldwide since 1981,including 57,575 in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
