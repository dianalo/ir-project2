The plan ``is obviously, as it is, totally unacceptable,''Hussein said in an interview on Channel 4's ``World This Week''program. ``It denies the Palestinians everything they aspire toachieve.''   ``I believe that Israel must be persuaded to review its position,and it is the duty of Israel's friends the world over ... to saveIsrael from Israel, and save all of us as a result,'' Hussein said.   Under the plan, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip would elect representatives to negotiate a peace settlementwith Israel.   Earlier this month, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israelaccepted several hard-line conditions set by his right-wing Likudbloc, including an end to the 19-month uprising in the territoriesbefore negotiations begin. Another condition is that Jews would beallowed to continue settling in the occupied lands.   The conditions angered the left-of-center Labor Party, whichshares power with Likud in a coalition government. Labor has saidthe conditions virtually kill the proposal because they areunacceptable to Palestinians.</TEXT></DOC>
