(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Randy Simmons is a quadriplegic because hetried what he thought was a safe, non-prescription food supplementto deal with pain and sleeplessness, his lawyers say.   The food supplement was L-tryptophan. The 41-year-old owner of asmall accounting company is one of more than 1,400 peoplenationwide who contracted a rare blood disorder,eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome or EMS, after taking the product oncetouted in vitamin catalogs as ``nature's tranquilizer.''   Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control haverecorded 19 deaths.   Simmons and dozens of others have sued retailers, suppliers andmanufacturers of the amino acid, which has been on the market foryears. Cases of EMS started showing up last summer, but experts saythe problem previously may have been misdiagnosed.   CDC has reports of 1,411 cases in all 50 states, the District ofColumbia and Puerto Rico. California has the most cases with 239.New York has reported 140. Twelve states have more than 30 cases.They are: Texas, 72; Ohio, 72; Florida, 71; Minnesota, 63; Oregon,61; South Carolina, 53; Pennsylvania, 52; Arizona, 46; Washington,43; Colorado, 38; Illinois, 38; and New Mexico, 33.   L-tryptophan was recalled by the Food and Drug Administration inNovember. On Thursday, Louis Sullivan, Health and Human Servicessecretary, issued a strong warning against continued use, callingthe EMS outbreak a ``major public health problem'' and warning thateven small doses of L-tryptophan could be harmful.   Simmons is surviving thanks to a machine that breathes for himand a feeding tube that runs into his stomach. He has limited useof his right arm and hand, but his mental faculties are sharp andhe still has feeling in his body and limbs. His prognosis isuncertain.   ``We've talked to quite a few of the lawyers handling thesecases nationwide and we haven't heard of another case as serious''in an EMS survivor, said Arden Bradshaw, Simmons' attorney.   Bradshaw has filed suit in Sedgwick County District Courtseeking unspecified damages from six businesses _ retail stores andtheir suppliers for brands of L-triptophan that Simmons took overthe years.   Four to six Japanese manufacturers made the food supplement.Some investigators believe most of the people who have beenstricken with EMS took L-tryptophan that can be traced to onemanufacturer. The CDC has not pinpointed the source of the problem.   One lawyer handling L-triptophan cases, Gayle Troutwine ofPortland, Ore., argues that Showa Denko Co. of Japan is responsiblefor the outbreak because its product became contaminated. A suitfiled by Troutwine last month on behalf of Helen Jones, 52, ofPortland also claims Showa Denko has refused to cooperate with U.S.officials investigating the supplement.   At the time the lawsuit was filed, Shotaro Kawakatsu, aspokesman in Japan for Showa Denko, noted that the FDA wasinvestigating the illness and said the company was awaiting theresults of the study. Kawakatsu said his company had exportedL-trytophan to the United States but declined to say how much.   Showa Denko is not named as a defendant in Simmons' suit.Bradshaw said he is still doing research to determine what companyor companies manufactured the products his client took.   L-tryptophan was touted as an aid for problems including highcholesterol, high blood pressure, tooth pain and depression.   Simmons began taking it about 2{ years ago because he was havingtrouble sleeping, in part because of recurring pain from injuriessuffered in a 1983 auto accident. Simmons found he was able tosleep better, but last September, he realized something was verywrong. He was losing weight _ eventually, more than 80 pounds _ andexperiencing severe muscle pain.   Doctors looked for cancer, parasites and other diseases beforefinally diagnosing EMS, which is characterized by an abnormallyhigh white blood cell count.   On Nov. 6, Simmons went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,for treatments that included chemotheraphy and a blood cleansingprocess. He's now back in a Wichita hospital; it hasn't beendetermined whether the effort stopped his decline.   Linda Simmons, his 35-year-old wife, said her husband has beentoo ill to become angry about his situation. But she has foughtdepression and other problems as she struggled to take care herhusband of seven years, their son, 3, and their daughter, 1.   ``I've had a good deal of anger about it,'' she said. ``Butthere are no boundaries or definitions for what's going on. Whatshould I be angry at?''</TEXT></DOC>
