A senior Goldman official said the moves also indicated that Goldman intends to invest more of its own money in leveraged buy-outs and other types of financings.    The firm is combining its corporate finance, private finance and leveraged buyout units into a &quot;global finance group.&quot; Goldman officials added that the moves also reflected an assertion of power by a young group of managers who are gaining influence at the firm.    The group includes Geoffrey T. Boisi, the firm's 40-year-old co-head of investment banking; he will take over day-to-day control of the combined units, which account for about 175 of Goldman's 450-member investment banking staff. Mr. Boisi is regarded as a protege of Robert E. Rubin, 48, and Stephen Friedman, 49, who are members of the firm's management committee.    &quot;We have some young, aggressive people taking over here, and they have some ideas about the way things should be run,&quot; the senior official said.    Mr. Boisi said that combining the three units would make it easier for the firm to deal with clients.    As part of the reorganization, Peter M. Sacerdote, 49, who has been head of corporate finance, will, among other responsibilities, help to head a committee that will oversee the firm's investments in leveraged buy-outs and other financing opportunities.    The senior official said the firm wants to make sure it has an experienced finance official to oversee such risky investment activities as Goldman Sachs becomes more heavily involved in them. Mr. Sacerdote couldn't be reached for comment.    The senior official said the opportunity for Mr. Sacerdote &quot;fits in nicely&quot; with the wish of Mr. Boisi to choose his own finance chief. The official speculated that Mr. Boisi intends to turn over the finance operation to Fred Eckert, 39, who has been head of leveraged buy-out operations.    While Mr. Eckert will lose some of his management responsibilities in the current reshuffling, he will remain in the global finance group working with Mr. Boisi. Mr. Eckert declined to comment.    David A. George, 45, who had headed private finance, is moving to the operations division, where he will head the firm's computerization.    Officials of the firm said that Mr. George faces a major task because Goldman Sachs hasn't given sufficient attention to its information systems. Mr. George, who couldn't be reached, is expected eventually to head the entire operations division. </TEXT></DOC>
