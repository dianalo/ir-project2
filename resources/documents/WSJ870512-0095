GE said last Friday the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers voted in favor of changes that include reduction of hourly classifications to six from 31; a restructuring of the salaried work force; and a drive to reduce absenteeism by advance scheduling of vacation time. The company didn't estimate how much the changes would save.    As previously reported, a pricing dispute last January prompted GE to drop Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Osaka, Japan, as GE's supplier of color TV sets. The company said it would produce the sets on its own.    Key in the decision to drop the Japanese firm was &quot;an understanding&quot; with the electrical workers union to make the Bloomington plant more competitive.    The company planned to move production to Bloomington of 500,000 sets previously imported from Japan.    On June 1, GE said it will add another production line to the 12-line plant, which also produces about two million RCA-brand sets annually.    The move reflects both the work rule changes and &quot;an optimistic view of the second quarter,&quot; a GE spokesman said, noting that industry-wide color TV sales were up 8% this year over last. </TEXT></DOC>
