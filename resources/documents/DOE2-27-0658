In dealing with the comparison between changes,the following tendencies were observed: conventional treatment methodsproduce partly more pronounced changes than irradiation with standarddoses. Heat treatment, for instance, results in a greater weight loss,in altered sugar content, and in higher content of carbonyl and aldehydereleasing compounds. Gas treatment will cut the volatile oil contentin half, while it remains nearly constant after irradiation. However,in some cases, an irradiation with standard doses may cause changes whichshould not be disregarded. In onions, for instance, irradiation is causinga stronger decomposition during storage than only cold storage.</TEXT></DOC>
