Fillion said $7.7 million of the low-interest loan will be usedto provide a new power plant for the Haiti Cement Corp., and therest will be used for agricultural and hydroelectrical studies.French aid in the past has been in the form of technical, health andeducation programs.   West Germany granted $3 million for the development ofhydroelectric energy in Haiti, said a West German diplomat, whoasked not to be identified.   ``We are resuming this special program to encourage the currentdialogue between the Haitian government and private sectors,'' thediplomat said. ``It is our belief that dialogue will contribute tothe transition to democracy in this country.''   France, Haiti's former colonial ruler, has contributed $80million in aid to Haiti since 1984. French aid was reduced after theNovember 1987 election day massacre, in which thugs protected bysoldiers killed at least 36 voters.   A soldiers' revolt on Sept. 17 ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, whocame to power after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in1986. The soldiers, demanding a return to democracy and respect forhuman rights, appointed Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril as president.   Since 1986, West Germany has granted about $25 million to Haiti,the diplomat said.   Haiti's largest donor, the United States, suspended $70 in directassistance after the 1987 election massacre. The Reaganadministration has made $30 million available to the governmentsince Avril came to power, but there has been no decision onresuming the full aid package.</TEXT></DOC>
