He quoted a member of the three-man Arab League mediatingcommittee as telling the 63 deputies:   ``You have often said you would solve your country's problems in10 hours if left alone with no external forces meddling. But we seeyou have spent 10 days here without achieving results.''   The source spoke on condition of anonymity and would not saywhich mediator made the comment. The three are foreign ministersPrince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Ahmed Ghozali of Algeria andAbdul-Latif al-Filali of Morocco.   Mediators held separate meetings with groups of legislators,trying to gain agreement on a proposed reconciliation charter.   Talks began after a cease-fire took hold in Beirut on Sept. 22that ended six months of artillery duels between Gen. Michel Aoun'sChristian forces and an alliance of Syria and Moslems militias. Theshelling killed more than 900 people.   In Beirut on Tuesday, snipers exchanged gunfire along theLebanese capital's dividing Green Line and the first battlefatality was reported since the truce took effect. First Lt.Abdul-Rahman Aslan, a Shiite Moslem, was killed and three soldierswere wounded in a clash between Moslem troops and Christian armyunits.   An 18-member task force in Taif is formulating a draft forpolitical reforms.   Deputies were reported to be moving slowly toward a peace planafter hard-line Christians conceded that immediate Syrianwithdrawal from Lebanon would allow militias to take control ofMoslem regions.   The presence of Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon is the mainissue that has threatened to undermine the talks.   The Arab committee proposes a phased Syrian withdrawal from theBeirut area to be completed in two years. A total pullout woulddepend on Israel's ending its occupation of a security zone insouth Lebanon and conclusion of a Syrian-Lebanese security pact.   The Moslems and their Syrian backers have said Damascus shouldwithdraw its troops only after a political settlement of the civilwar has been achieved.   Before the Christians agree to political reforms, they wantguarantees of a Syrian pullout within six months.   Acknowledgement by Christian legislators that a quick Syrianwithdrawal could spur more turmoil raised speculation that acompromise was in the works. Later, however, ``sharp differences onthe Syrian role were renewed, and it was as if the deputies wereback at the starting point,'' one source said.   Another said, ``They keep moving in vicious circles, going backon what they had indicated they will approve.''   Syrian troops have been in Lebanon since 1976 under an ArabLeague peacekeeping mandate. Aoun says Syria violated its mandateby backing the Moslems in the civil war.   Moslems say they now make up 55 percent of Lebanon's populationand want more political power than was accorded them in theunwritten national covenant going back to independence from Francein 1943, when Christians were in the majority.   In Nicosia, Cyprus, State Prosecutor Rallis Gavrielides said incourt Tuesday that six Lebanese men being tried for illegal armspossession there all confessed they went to Cyprus from Lebanonlast May to assassinate Aoun.   Under Cyprus law, arms possession carries a maximum sentence oflife imprisonment. Plotting to kill, the charge that was dropped,is punishable by a lesser maximum of 14 years imprisonment.   Gavrielides said the accused confessed they intended to shootdown Aoun's helicopter. Aoun was to pass through Cyprus en route toMorocco to attend an Arab summit meeting on Lebanon, but canceledthe trip.</TEXT></DOC>
