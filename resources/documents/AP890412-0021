The bombing of a Pan Am jetliner in December over Scotland,which the department's office of counter terrorism said probablywas a terrorist incident, and the Palestinian uprising on the WestBank and in Gaza helped push the total of incidents to a new highof 856, up 3 percent from 1987.   In all, 658 people were killed and 1,131 wounded, an increase infatalities from 633 in 1987 but a decrease in injuries from 2,272.   The casualty figures include terrorists themselves who werekilled or wounded during attacks as well as attacks by Afghanistanagainst Pakistan, a U.S. ally which funneled American weapons toAfghan guerrillas.   In all, the citizens and property of 79 nations were attacked in60 countries. Businessmen and tourists accounted for 77 percent ofthe victims. The weapon used most often by terrorists was the bomb.It was used in 48 percent of the attacks, said the report releasedTuesday.   The Army's top uniformed lawyer contends that the U.S. militarycan legally attack terrorists without violating a 1976 presidentialorder that bans assassinations of individuals abroad,   Maj. Gen. Hugh Overholt, the service's judge advocate general,argued in an eight-page draft memorandum that because of changes in``the nature of the threat,'' action against terrorists can bejustified on grounds of national self-defense.   Overholt's memorandum was disclosed Monday by the newsletterDefense Week and confirmed by Army officials.   The State Department report said the United States remained aprimary target for international terrorism last year, as the numberof anti-U.S. incidents rose from 149 in 1987 to 185. They resultedin 192 persons killed and 40 wounded, compared with seven Americanskilled and 47 wounded in 1987.   The increase in deaths was due largely to the attack onU.S.-bound Pan Am 103 in which 259 people aboard the jumbo jet and11 on the ground perished. Of the victims 189 were Americans.   Latin America was the area showing the largest percentage ofincidents against U.S. citizens and property _ 60 percent.   On the whole, the Middle East again had the highest incidence ofinternational terrorism, with 313 attacks. Israel, including theWest Bank and Gaza, again was the main target, accounting for 29percent of the attacks.   The State Department credited Syria and Iraq with a substantialreduction in direct involvement in terrorism last year, but saidboth countries continued to provide safe haven and training toterrorist organizations.   Iran's decision to end its war with Iraq and expand ties to theWest lessened Iranian involvement in terrorism, but Iran continuedto include terrorism among its foreign-policy tools, the reportsaid.   At year's end, 20 foreigners were listed as political hostagesbeing held in Lebanon, two others possibly were dead, while 13 werereleased during the year.   Ranked behind Israel, in order, as sites for the most terroristincidents were Pakistan, Colombia, Spain, Lebanon, West Germany,Zimbabwe, South Korea, Peru and France.   The 10 countries accounted for 75 percent of the incidentsduring the year, the report said.   The Palestinian uprising, which began in December 1987 andcontinued through last year in the Israeli-held West Bank and GazaStrip, should be viewed overall as a ``civil insurrection,'' theState Department said.   But the report said since it contained ``elements of terrorism''in some instances, all civilian casualties were included in the1988 statistics.</TEXT></DOC>
