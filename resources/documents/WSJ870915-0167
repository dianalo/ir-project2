U.S. &quot;suggests the Supreme Court is about to move toward restoring the test of &quot;mens rea&quot; {guilty mind} and &quot;actus reus&quot; {evil act}.&quot; Actually, McNally had little if anything to do with these legal doctrines, but dealt instead with the substance of the mail-fraud statute. As you pointed out, the court decided, 7-2, that the mail-fraud statute protects property rights but does not refer to -- and therefore does protect -- the intangible rights of citizens to honest government.    But you failed to mention that in a scathing dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens, joined in part by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, uses words such as &quot;ludicrous,&quot; &quot;senseless&quot; and &quot;distressing&quot; to describe various aspects of the majority's decision. Calling the majority McNally decision &quot;a serious mistake,&quot; Justice Stevens questions why &quot;a Court that has not been particularly receptive to the rights of criminal defendants in recent years has acted so dramatically to protect the elite class of powerful individuals who will benefit from this decision.&quot; Justice Stevens also broadly hints that Congress move to quickly to override McNally. G. Robert Blakey, a professor at Notre Dame Law School, told us that he expects hundreds of persons already convicted of public corruption under the mail-fraud statute to petition to overturn their convictions.
