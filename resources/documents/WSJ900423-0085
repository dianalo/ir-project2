The move on Friday heightened recession fears in someindustries. Canada's high interest rates have already pushedthe residential building industry into a recession, said GordThompson, president of the Canadian Home Builders'Association. He said builders are being forced to take backproperties in the Toronto area and elsewhere. Some buyers, inunloading their properties, are giving up large deposits.</LP><TEXT>   The interest rate rise also hit stock prices. The TorontoStock Exchange composite index fell 54.99 points Friday, fora total decrease for the week of 205.6 points. The index hasfallen 7.6% since the recent series of declines began April9.   Financial analysts said rising interest rates would hitcommunication and media companies especially hard, asadvertising revenues declined in response to a slowdown inthe economy.   The interest rate rise has been prompted by concern aboutCanadian inflation. Canadian short-term interest rates aremore than 5 1/4 percentage points higher than comparable U.S.rates.   Canada's consumer price index in March rose a seasonallyadjusted 0.3% from February and 5.3% from a year earlier,Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.   Economists warned that the inflation outlook remainsominous, in view of current wage demands and the government'splan to introduce a 7% consumption tax on Jan. 1.   Canada's high interest rates have pushed up the Canadiandollar, squeezing Canadian exporters. The Canadian dollar'srise has led to &quot;declining profits, plummeting orders andsignificant layoffs&quot; in the manufacturing industry, said ToddRutley, senior economist with the Canadian Manufacturers'Association, an industry group.   The Canadian dollar closed Friday in Toronto at 86 U.S.cents, down from 86.06 cents Thursday but up 1.5 cents frommid-March.   Rezmi Markar, associate economist with Data Resources ofCanada, said he expects the prime rate to drop by less thanone percentage point by the end of the year. But he forecasta new upswing in interest rates in early 1991, because of theinflationary effect of the planned consumption tax. Theproposed value-added tax, which will replace a more narrowlybased manufacturers sales tax, has been passed by the Houseof Commons but still needs approval by the Senate.   Ernie Stokes, a research director with WEFA Group Ltd.,warned that a recession could occur this year if interestrates persist at current levels.   As well as inflation concerns, Canadian financial marketsare unsettled by proposed constitutional revisions that wouldgive Quebec, a largely French-speaking province, &quot;distinctsociety&quot; status in the constitution.   The prime rate rise followed an increase Thursday in theBank of Canada's bank rate to 13.77%, its highest level inmore than seven years, from 13.61%. The rate is the levy thecentral bank charges on its loans to financial institutions.</TEXT></DOC>
