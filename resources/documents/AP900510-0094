All 259 passengers and crew aboard the plane were killed whenthe jet plowed into the quiet Scottish town Dec. 21, 1988. Elevenpeople on the ground were killed, a dozen others were injured andmany homes were damaged or destroyed.   About 250 Lockerbie familes filed claims in Dade Circuit Courtbecause two Pan Am subsidiaries have headquarters here, said Miamiattorney Aaron Podhurst.   ``It was negotiated over a period of time, and it justculminated this week,'' said Podhurst, who represents the LockerbieAir Disaster Committee. Under the agreement he was prevented fromreleasing any details, he said.   New York-based Pan Am spokesman Jeffrey Kreindler acknowledged asettlement but also said he could not discuss its terms.   The agreement doesn't affect lawsuits filed by the families ofthose aboard the plane, Podhurst said. Some of those suits alsowere filed in Miami, but the majority are in federal court in NewYork.   The passenger claims are covered by international agreements andare limited to $75,000 unless victims can prove gross negligence.Pan Am agreed that the Lockerbie ground victims were covered byScottish law, which Podhurst said had no limit.   A Scottish investigation into the crash is to be completed inSeptember and probably will be the basis for settling the passengerclaims, Podhurst said.   Flight 103 was flying from London to New York when a bomb wentoff in the luggage hold.   Investigations indicated a bomb may have been placed inside aradio in baggage put aboard the flight in Frankfurt, West Germany.The luggage was transferred to the Pan Am Boeing 747 in London, andit exploded over Lockerbie shortly after takeoff.   U.S. authorities acknowledged they had received an alert about apossible attack on a Pan Am airliner and had even warned diplomaticpersonnel to avoid using the carrier.   The Lockerbie suits charged Pan Am ``had actual and constructiveknowledge'' that Flight 103 ``was subject to a specific and knowndanger of terrorist or other criminal or wrongful activities.''   Pan Am's Miami subsidiaries, Pan Am World Services and AlertManagement Systems, were accused of failing to provide adequatesecurity for the flight.</TEXT></DOC>
