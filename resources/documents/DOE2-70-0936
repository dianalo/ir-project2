<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-0936 </DOCNO><TEXT>The ultimate objective of the part of the research conducted under thiscontract was to demonstrate the feasibility of accelerating the radioactivedecay of populations of long-lived isomeric states of nuclear excitation.Such an achievement would represent a substantial step along the pathof research which might ultimately lead to a gamma-ray laser. Quantitativemodeling has indicated that such a result might be obtained through atype of optical pumping with laser plasma X-rays produced by conventionaldevices of realistic size. The research necessary to test the overallviability of the concept is being pursued at the Center for Quantum Electronicsof the University of Texas at Dallas. The work conducted under this contractwas the first step of a type of scaling study that would indicate howclose to threshold the medium for a gamma-ray laser could be pumped withexisting fusion lasers. Calculations had indicated that if a suitable``ideal'' medium can be found, the threshold for a gamma-ray laser wouldbe attained before breakeven in fusion. This first phase of researchwas focused upon the demonstration of the overall efficiency for thecoupling of x-radiation into {gamma}-ray fluorescence through the absorptionby a nuclear ground state population of X-radiation from a laser plasma.As no actual laser shots were ever allocated, only theoretical resultsare available. 25 refs., 6 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
