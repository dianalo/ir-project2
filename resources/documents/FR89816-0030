Box 9413, KansasCity, MO 64120-0013, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 9E3747 proposingto establish a tolerance for the insecticide cyfluthrin (cyano(4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylate)in or on the raw agricultural commodity (RAC) fresh hops imported fromGermany at 4.0 parts per million (ppm) and food additive petition (FAP)9H5580 proposing to amend 40 CFR 185.1250 by establishing a tolerance forcyfluthrin in or on dried hops at 20.0 ppm.There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The toxicological data considered in support of the proposedtolerances include a 12-month oral toxicity study on dogs with a no-observed-effectlevel (NOEL) of 4.0 mg/kg/day; 24-month rat and mouse chronic feeding studieswith systemic NOEL's of 2.5 mg/kg/day in the rat and 7.5 mg/kg/day in themouse with no oncogenic effects observed under the conditions of the studiesat dose levels up to and including 22.5 and 120 mg/kg/day, the highestdose levels tested for rats and mice, respectively. No teratogenic effectswere observed in rats at dose levels up to and including 30 mg/kg/day,or in rabbits at levels up to and including 45 mg/kg/day (the highest doselevels tested). The following genotoxicity tests were negative: a genemutation assay (CHO/HGPRT), a sister chromatic exchange assay, and an unscheduledDNA synthesis assay.The acceptable daily intake (ADI), based on a NOEL of 2.5 mg/kg body weight/dayfrom a 2-year rat feeding study and a safety factor of 100, is 0.025 mg/kgbody weight/day.Establishment of these tolerances based on the Tolerance Assessment Systemanalysis, which estimated the average U.S. population dietary exposure,will result in a theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from theproposed tolerances of 0.000075 mg/kg body weight/day; this is equivalentto about 0.3 percent of the ADI. The total TMRC for published tolerancesplus this on hops would be 0.001095 mg/kg/day, or 4.4% of the ADI.Meat and milk tolerances are currently established at 0.05 ppm and 0.10ppm, respectively. Although spent hops are a cattle feed, no increasesin the current tolerances are necessary. Thus, the established meat andmilk tolerances for cyfluthrin are adequate for this use. Hops are nota poultry feed item; therefore, secondary residues in eggs and poultryare not likely to occur from this use.There are no regulatory actions pending against registration of the insecticide,nor are there any other relevant considerations involved in establishingthe proposed tolerances. The metabolism of cyfluthrin in plants and animalsis adequately understood for this use, and an adequate analytical method,gas liquid chromatography with an electron capture detector, is availablefor enforcement purposes.Prior to publication in the <T3>Pesticide Analytical Manual, </T3>Vol. II, the enforcement methodologyis being made available in the interim; to anyone who is interested inpesticide enforcement when requested from: By mail: Calvin Furlow, PublicInformation Branch (H-7506C), Field Operations Division, Office of PesticidePrograms, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington,DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 242, CM andplusmin;2, 1921 JeffersonDavis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-557-4432.Based on the above information and data considered, the Agency concludesthat the tolerances are useful for the purposes for which they are soughtand they will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances areestablished as set forth below.Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedregulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document controlnumber, [PP 9E3747 and FAP 9H5580/P486]. All written comments filed inresponse to this document will be available in the Public Docket and Freedomof Information Section, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 180 and 185</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Food additives,Pesticides and pests, Recording and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
