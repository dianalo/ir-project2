(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A retired Teledyne Electronics Inc.executive testified today that he hired a Washington lobbyist onthe recommendation of Navy engineer Stuart Berlin.   William Rosen, former vice president for marketing, testifiedthat Berlin, a Navy engineer who has pleaded guilty in the Pentagonprocurement scandal, recommended that he hire Michael Savaides as aWashington lobbyist for the California-based aerospace company.   Rosen said he was told by Berlin that Savaides was ``employed bya company engaged in manufacturing and selling similar equipment.''   ``You felt he knew his way around the Navy?'' asked prosecutorJack Hanly, and Rosen said yes.   Berlin, who is expected to testify later, is cooperating withthe government investigation of the Pentagon procurement scandal,which involved the payment of bribes and kickbacks to militaryprocurement officials and outside Pentagon consultants to obtainprocurement information and influence the award of lucrativecontracts.   Rosen, testifying under an immunity grant at the bribery andconspiracy trial of three Teledyne executives in U.S. DistrictCourt, also told how he was angered when told that Washingtondefense consultant William L. Parkin was working, without hisknowledge, to help Teledyne obtain a Navy contract.   ``You might say I became angry,'' Rosen testified, recallingthat he went to see Eugene R. Sullivan, one of the defendants, and``expressed my outrage over meddling in my department.''   Rosen said he learned that Parkin was working for Teledyne fromFred H. Lackner, another defense consultant who, like Parkin, haspleaded guilty and is expected to testify as a prosecution witnessin the case.   Recalling the events of the fall of 1985, Rosen said thatSullivan initially told him he was ``not prepared to discuss it.The only thing he said was he did not engage a consultant.''   Sullivan and two other Teledyne executives are defendants in thefirst trial of the Justice Department ``Ill Wind'' investigationinto Pentagon procurement fraud.   Prosecutors are trying to prove that the three conspired tobribe a public official for information that helped their companywin a $24 million contract.   The three defendants _ Sullivan, George Kaub, Dale Schnittjer _were executives with Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.,a division of Teledyne Industries. Lawyers for the men, who arecharged with bribery, conspiracy and making false statements, saytheir clients have done nothing wrong.   ``This is a case about bribing, about cheating, about lying,''charged Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert DeHenzel Jr. in his openingarguments Monday.   The three are accused of conspiring to bribe a Navy official toinfluence the award of a hand-held radar testing device for theNavy.   Rosen testified, he met Parkin at a meeting in Sullivan's officethat was also attended by Kaub. The meeting was held to discusshiring Parkin to help Teledyne get the contract, Rosen said.   Parkin told the Teledyne officials ``he knew his way around theNavy, that he could do a job for us.''   Rosen said that Parkin wanted a written agreement which hedescribed as ink on paper to formalize his consulting relationshipwith Teledyne. In return ``he would take measures to assure thecontract would be awarded to Teledyne Electronics.''   The agreement called for Parkin to receive $10,000 in advancefor expenses and $150,000 as a reward once Teledyne obtained thecontract.   Rosen said he later expressed misgivings to Sullivan about theagreement with Parkin. Recalling a conversation on a golf course,Rosen said he told Sullivan, ``I think we were being foolish. Ithought we were being ripped off.''   Asked how Sullivan replied, Rosen said, ``He said I was just asinvolved as everybody else.''   At Monday's opening day of the trial the first witness wasCharles Jones, an Air Force contracting officer.   On the witness stand, Jones discussed the 25-month process thatled to the Pentagon's decision in July 1987 to sign with TeledyneElectronics a contract to make hand-held radar test equipment.   DeHenzel argued the three defendants were part of a conspiracythat included bribing Berlin to receive inside information crucialto winning the contract.   He said Berlin provided information about another competitorthat should have been kept secret.   ``A lot of information should not have been given to anyoneoutside government,'' he said.   Berlin also spoke during internal Pentagon discussions in favorof a position that benefited Teledyne, he said. Specifically, theformer Navy official opposed limiting the contract to smallbusinesses, a decision that would have excluded Teledyne frombidding. That decision was ultimately reversed.   Teledyne Industries, Parkin, Lackner and Berlin were all namedin the indictment returned by a grand jury in January. They pleadedguilty and are cooperating with the government. Savaides alsopleaded guilty, but he was not indicted.   The defendants' lawyers said their clients never knew about asecret deal that Parkin made with his associates. Kaub, Sullivanand Schnittjer believed Parkin used legitimate methods to obtaininformation about contracts, a time-honored practice, they said.   ``The conspiracy in this case was directed as much as concealingfrom Teledyne as defrauding the government,'' said GeorgeO'Connell, Sullivan's lawyer.   Mark Tuohey, Kaub's attorney, described the deal between Parkinand his associates as a ``conspiracy of silence.''   Kaub was Teledyne Electronics' executive vice president dealingwith government contracts. Sullivan and his successor, Schnittjer,were also executive vice presidents.   As part of the evidence, prosecutors have said they will playtapes from conversations between Parkin and his associates. Thegovernment taped the telephone calls as part of their investigation.   The coast-to-coast investigation into the Pentagon's$150-billion-a-year purchasing system began nearly three years, butit was not publicly revealed until June 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
