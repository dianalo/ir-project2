The new MineralsAct eliminates the state's exclusive right to mine anddispose of all precious metals, precious stones and naturaloil.   Mineral rights holders no longer must lease rights fromthe state but can own them by getting a government permit.New ventures must obtain a prospecting permit or miningauthorization. Existing operations are allowed two years toshift to the permit system.   The Chamber of Mines, which represents South Africanmining firms, said that although the government has given upits exclusive rights, sudden changes in the market aren'texpected. The group said the new system gives the governmentmore control over all mining activities, because the permitrequirements are stricter than previous controls.   The law allows the government to impose stringentenvironmental, safety and health rules, and stipulates widerunion participation to ensure worker safety.                                                                                                          PAKISTAN NUCLEAR DEAL FOR CHINA                                                                                                          Beijing has agreed to build a nuclear power plant inPakistan, its second. China, in its new disclosure about itsusually secret nuclear-technology transfers, didn't specifythe cost of the 300,000-kilowatt plant in Chasma, designatedfor peaceful purposes. Pakistani reports said it wouldn'texceed $500 million. Last month, China disclosed nuclearequipment deals with Syria and Iran. Western countries haveexpressed concern about China's sales of nuclear technologyand equipment with potential military uses to Third Worldcountries.                                                                                                          ARGENTINA GETS NEW CURRENCY                                                                                                          The peso, Argentina's fifth currency in 22 years, replacedthe austral, which inflation made virtually worthless. Bothcurrencies will be accepted until the switch is complete. Onepeso is valued at 10,000 australs -- equal to $1. In effect,the peso knocked four zeros off the austral. One austral wasvalued at $1.25 when that unit was introduced in June 1985.                                                                                                          TAIWAN LAWMAKING ERA ENDS                                                                                                          In retiring from Taiwan's Parliament, 82 elderlyNationalist Party lawmakers who were elected to office inChina 44 years ago ended an era. The Legislative Yuandeputies had been targets of pro-democracy demonstrationssince Taiwan ended 38 years of martial-law rule in 1987. In1949, after the Nationalists lost the mainland civil war toCommunist forces, 550 China-elected legislators fled toTaiwan with Gen. Chiang Kai-shek, who kept them in office toensure the island party's monopoly on power and attempt tolegitimize its claim as the rightful Chinese government.                                                                                                          SINGAPORE'S GROWTH MAY EASE                                                                                                          Singapore's economic growth will ease to 5% this year from6.5% last year because of wealthy nations' economic slowdown,Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said. Growth in other Asiancountries would help the island's trade and tourism, Mr. Gohsaid. Singapore's gold and foreign-exchange reserves lastSept. 30 totaled $32.9 billion, up 15% from a year earlier.The city-state needs large reserves to pay for neededimports, including food, oil and clothing, and as a safetynet to prop up its economy should a prolonged world recessioncut Singapore's exports and boost unemployment, he said.                                                                                                          BEIJING, SEOUL SIGN TRADE PACT                                                                                                          China and South Korea have signed a trade agreement givingmost-favored nation treatment to each other's exports.   The accord is expected to result in sharply increasedbilateral trade, which has been hampered by high Chinesesurcharges on South Korean products. Their trade last yearwas estimated at more than $5 billion, with China logging asurplus of about $2.5 billion.   As the two countries don't have formal relations, theBeijing office of Korea Trade Promotion Corp. serves as a defacto diplomatic mission to deal with the China Chamber ofInternational Commerce. The Seoul agency predicted thataviation and investment guarantee accords would be concludedthis year.   Both sides hope to open flights between Seoul and Tianjin,a Chinese port city. South Korean flights into Beijing aren'texpected without diplomatic ties, still years off, as Chinadoesn't want to embarrass its ally, North Korea.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          The Swedish shipping company Sealink Stena, citingfinancial losses, closed its English Channel ferry servicethat has been operated between Folkestone, England, andBoulogne, France, for 148 years. About 1,000 jobs in bothports were lost. . . . The Ukraine, to win financial backingfor the former Soviet republic's transition to capitalism,applied to join the International Monetary Fund and the WorldBank. Other new members of the Commonwealth of IndependentStates are expected to apply soon.</TEXT></DOC>
