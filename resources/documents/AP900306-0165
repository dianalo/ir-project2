PUGH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A gourmet brownie maker is claiming in a federallawsuit it was burned by a 71-year-old baking giant in Minnesotathat allegedly stole a recipe and sold it under a new name.   The Boston Brownie Co. alleges McGlynn Bakeries of Eden Prairie,Minn., took the batter recipes for Boston Brownies and marketedthem, with a few minor changes, under the name Classic BrownieBatter. McGlynn denies the allegations.   The U.S. District Court lawsuit filed last last month cites anagreement between the two companies in which McGlynn wouldmanufacture the batter for Boston Brownie, and for its own store inMinneapolis. The agreement said the recipes were a trade secret andthat McGlynn would protect them, the lawsuit contends.   Boston Brownies, which has one store in the Faneuil Hallmarketplace, makes ``gourmet brownies'' in 20 flavors. In additionto the traditional fudge and fudge nut varieties, offerings includerocky road, mint, toffee, amaretto, kahlua, white chocolatemacadamia nut and chocolate chip.   ``It's my recipe, my process, my logo, and all of that,'' saidLaura J. Katleman, the owner and inventor of Boston Brownie, whichhas sales of about $400,000 annually.   The Classic Brownie Batters, which McGlynn has marketed forabout two years, also come in flavors such as rocky road, toffee,mint and amaretto, as well as chocolate, chocolate pecan, cherry,white chocolate chunk, and blond chocolate chip.   ``Have you ever heard of amaretto brownies? Where did he getthose flavors?'' Katleman asked Monday. What's more, she said,``the fudginess, the ingredients, they read the same as mine. Mychemist says for McGlynn to have come up with these formulas itwould have been a miracle.''   Katleman said she was appalled by what she called McGlynn's lackof honor in allegedly fudging things so her brownies were soldunder his name. McGlynn Bakeries is run by Michael J. McGlynn.   What made her particularly angry, she said, was ``the way hewooed me. He invited me to his home, I met his family. He was sowarm and sweet, and to find out he was doing this.   ``Maybe I am naive about the workings of big business, but hisconduct in this whole matter was just appalling to me.''   Sales at McGlynn, which has retail bakeries and manufacturesfrozen dough and pre-baked foods, totaled about $100 million in1989, McGlynn said in a telephone interview. He said the sales fromClassic Batter Brownies comprised ``less than one-quarter of onepercent'' of total business.   McGlynn declined to comment on any aspect of the suit, but alawyer for McGlynn Bakeries, Jim Harlow, said the company deniedall of the suit's allegations.   ``We think the allegations of the complaint are groundless andthe company intends to vigorously defend against them,'' saidHarlow, who declined further comment.   Katleman said McGlynn first approached her after he had sampledsome of her brownies on a pass through Faneuil Hall.   ``He was just enamored of the whole concept of gourmetbrownies,'' said Katleman.   McGlynn wanted to lease the Boston Brownies recipe for franchisestores, but they could not agree on terms, Katleman said. Instead,they agreed to have him manufacture her batter, of which she needs``a couple of thousand pounds a week,'' she said.   Last December, Katleman discovered the Classic Brownie Battersin a McGlynn catalogue, which she saw in the offices of anotherbatter maker.   ``The guy started to read down the list, Chocolate Amaretto,Rocky Road, and he asked me `Are you sure he hasn't ripped youoff?' I was just blown away,'' Katleman said.   The lawsuit seeks to restrain McGlynn from any use of BostonBrownies batter, recipes, products, formulas and processes. It alsoseeks damages, but Katleman said she could not name a specificamount.</TEXT></DOC>
