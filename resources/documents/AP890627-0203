The allegation was dismissed as ``ridiculous'' by one of Rose'slawyers.   Paul G. Janszen, who claims he ran bets for the Cincinnati Redsmanager, told baseball investigators in February that Rose onceasked him to set up a cocaine ring and include him.   Janszen also said Rose once said he might consider throwing agame if he had a large bet on it. He also told investigators thatRose checked by telephone with other major-league managers abouttheir players' physical status before placing bets on their teams.   Janszen's claims were made in an interview included in thousandsof pages of exhibits to investigator John M. Dowd's report, whichwas released Monday.   It was the first time Rose has been linked to the cocaine ringoperated by former associates who ran a gymnasium in Cincinnatiwhere the manager worked out.   ``This idea of Rose being involved with drugs is so far off thewall that it's ridiculous,'' Rose lawyer Robert A. Pitcairn Jr.said. ``(To) anyone who knows Pete Rose and has known Pete Rose overthe years, there's just no question he wouldn't get involved withdrugs.   ``For Janszen to say this is slander of the worst kind. It'sfurther evidence to us that this guy will do anything to followthrough with his blackmail attempts of Pete Rose. Why Dowd'sinvestigators even went into areas like this is beyond me.''   According to a spokeswoman for Dowd, the investigator said heleft the drug references out of his 225-page summary report tobaseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti because it was notrelevant to the gambling inquiry.   In other developments, the former girlfriend of a Rose associatesaid she had corroborated the Dowd report's charge that Roseconspired to hide racetrack winnings from a $47,646 Pik-Six ticketin 1987 at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky.   If the charges are true, Rose faces possible indictment oncharges of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. A federalgrand jury is investigating Rose's income taxes.   Rose Fernbach Billiter, the former girlfriend of Thomas P.Gioiosa, told The Associated Press that she had provided first- andsecond-hand information supporting the charges to the FBI and theInternal Revenue Service.   Also, a Jan. 20 letter from Janszen to another attorney for Rose,Reuven J. Katz, reveals Janszen's feelings on why his relationshipwith Rose deteriorated.   ``Because I covered for him with his wife, while he was sleepinghis way around town, she no longer wanted me in their house,''Janszen said of Rose's wife. ``Carol doesn't have the guts to leavehim, so she has to blame his friends for his disgusting behavior.''   Attempts to reach Mrs. Rose by telephone Tuesday wereunsuccessful.   Rose, who faces a possible lifetime ban by baseball if it isdetermined he bet on his own team, won a temporary restraining orderpreventing Giamatti from holding a hearing on the charges.Baseball's lawyers have asked a three-judge panel of an Ohio appealscourt to suspend the restraining order and Rose's response is dueWednesday.   Janszen, who recently completed a four-month sentence for failureto report income, didn't say that Rose used drugs, but he said themanager thought he could get cash from drug deals conducted by acircle of associates. Several of the associates were sentenced afterfederal authorities cracked a ring that smuggled cocaine fromFlorida to Ohio.   Gioiosa faces trial in Cincinnati next month on charges of taxevasion and conspiring to arrange cocaine deliveries from Florida toCincinnati between 1985 and 1987.   Gold's Gym, where Rose worked out, was operated by Donald J.Stenger, who admitted smuggling 40 to 50 kilograms of cocaine fromFlorida to Cincinnati. Stenger was given an 10-year prison sentencelast March following a guilty plea.   Michael E. Fry, who owned the gym, is serving an eight-year termfor cocaine trafficking and tax evasion.   During his interview last February with baseball investigators,Janszen said that Rose showed him a copy of his income tax return in1987.   ``He showed me that and he told me at the same time, `Paul, ifyou get me involved and if you can, if you will set up a cocaineorganization and include me in it, you can spend as much money asyou ever want to because if they ever come to you and say where doyou get your money, I will tell them from Pete Rose,''' Janszen said.   Janszen also said Rose told him that Gioiosa, a former housemateof the manager, brought a suitcase with $200,000 into the Reds'clubhouse sometime during 1987 and showed Rose the money, whichsupposedly was going to be used to buy cocaine in Florida.   Janszen said that when he asked Rose why he wanted to getinvolved in cocaine, Rose responded that he had a certificate ofdeposit for $65,000 or $75,000 that was maturing in a few weeks. Hequoted Rose as saying:   ``I'll use that money and buy the kilos and I'll keep them in myhouse because nobody would have the ----- to come to my house.''</TEXT></DOC>
