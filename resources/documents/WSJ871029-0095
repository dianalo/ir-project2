The lawsuit, which also seeks $200 million in punitive damages, was filed in federal court in Manhattan. It names Los Angeles-based Occidental and its Island Creek Coal Co. unit, based in Lexington, Ky.    The suit involves a joint venture called Enoxy, formed in 1981. According to court papers, Occidental contributed four large coal mines in Kentucky and West Virginia and related assets, and the Italian agency contributed certain European chemical plants and cash with a total value of $525 million.    The suit charges, among other things, that Occidental hasn't indemnified the joint venture as it agreed to do for losses at two coal mines that have made them &quot;less valuable than the parties had bargained for.&quot;    The suit also says Occidental and Island Creek have &quot;obdurately and unjustifiably refused to fulfill their obligations to the joint venture&quot; and haven't avoided conflicts of interest between Island Creek -- which owns and operates many other coal mines -- and the joint venture.    In Los Angeles, Armand Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of Occidental, said, &quot;There is no merit to the suit, and we will vigorously defend our rights in court.&quot;    Dr. Hammer said the suit -- which was filed shortly after the court closed for business Tuesday, with a federal judge's permission -- was filed because a six-year statute of limitations was about to run out. </TEXT></DOC>
