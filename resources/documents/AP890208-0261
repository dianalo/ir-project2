Experts said the securities fraud scandals of the 1980s pale incomparison with the troubles in the trillion-dollar thrift industry,which this week prompted a $90 billion plan to staunch $100 billionin losses at hundreds of savings and loans.   ``I think the harm has been broader in the Sandamp;L problem, not fromthe criminality per se but from the compounding of all the problemsand the waste of economic resources,'' Bert Ely, a financialconsultant in Alexandria, Va., said Tuesday. ``I think the WallStreet stuff is small change.''   But the combination of shady dealings, the allure of the stockmarket and an aggressive federal prosecutor in New York combined toovershadow _ at least in the public eye _ a scandal that may havegrown unchecked for lack of enforcement in the mid-1980s.   President Bush's plan to rescue the savings and loan industryincludes $50 million more for the Justice Department to attackfraud. It would deploy extra investigators on 200 cases and addabout 80 federal fraud prosecutors.   In addition, federal regulators would be given broader powers,civil penalties would be increased to fines of up to $1 million perday, and criminal penalties would grow to 20 years or more in prison.   But some officials said the plan _ which comes two years after astepped-up federal probe in Texas that resulted in 33 indictments _may be too little, too late. Gray said the bank board was uncoveringfraud as early as 1983.   While doubling the number of examiners at the board, whichregulates the nation's 3,100 thrift institutions, Gray said he wasstymied by the Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. JusticeDepartment in pressing criminal prosecutions.   ``There were and are a lot of crooks down there,'' said Gray, nowpresident of Chase Federal Bank in Miami. ``The problem is all ofthis is so late. We all knew there was a problem in 1983 and '84.''   In New York, meanwhile, then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giulianiactively prosecuted securities fraud cases involving characters likeBoesky, the now-jailed speculator who paid $100 million in fines andillicit profits to answer securities charges.   A handful of other cases _ from the arrest of a 24-year-oldinside trader to the recent record $650 million settlement withinvestment giant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. _ also have drawn wideattention.   In contrast with the notoriety of insider trading, the bankboard's earlier probes of Sandamp;Ls often were kept quiet to avoidcreating public panic. A former bank board attorney said the boardoperated under the belief it was defending the industry it wasdesigned to regulate.   Hal Levi, who left the agency in 1982 after 10 years, said theidea of giving bank board examiners greater investigative power wasshot down as early as 1972, when one official feared they wouldbecome ``junior Dick Tracys.''   ``Clearly I think there was an absence of prosecution of thosekinds of cases in the late '70s and early '80s, even for ones thatwere referred'' to the Justice Department, he said. ``It was anever-ending source of frustration to me.''   Rosemary Stewart, the bank board's current enforcement director,said the Justice Department has not had enough prosecutors to handlethe number of referred bank fraud cases.   ``Just because a bank failed last year it's unreasonable toexpect that the owners who drove it into the ground will be in jailthis year,'' she said. ``Criminal enforcement work always followsthese problems. Certainly it's not too late.''   Added Gray: ``You've got to put your money where your mouth is ifyou want to go after these guys. They have the sharpest attorneys,the crookedest accountants. They're slimy like snakes and they knowhow to do these things.''</TEXT></DOC>
