His sporting blood is not aroused and he folds the paper andlooks over the scene at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club where he hascome to talk about CBS's Sunday movie ``The Incident.''   In ``The Incident,'' Matthau plays a lawyer, Harmon Cobb, whoreluctantly agrees to defend a German prisoner of war accused ofmurdering a popular local doctor at a POW camp in the United Statesduring World War II.   ``They tell me I have to defend him because they want a fairtrial and I'm the only qualified lawyer available,'' he says. ``Idon't want the case because my son's fighting in Europe, and duringthe trial I get a telegram saying he's been killed in action.   ``Harmon Cobb is an unassuming man, nondescript, quite ordinary.He's not well off financially, he's intelligent and very fair.That's the story. Regardless of his personal prejudices, he's goingto defend this man to the best of his ability.''   ``The Incident,'' filmed on location in Colorado Springs, alsostars Susan Blakely as Matthau's daughter-in-law, Robert Carradineas the prosecutor, Peter Firth as the German defendant, BarnardHughes as the victim, Harry Morgan as the judge and WilliamShallert as the constable.   It was directed by Joseph Sargent from a screenplay by Michaeland James Norell. Sargent directed Matthau in ``The Taking ofPelham One Two Three.''   Matthau began his career as a featured villain in ``TheKentuckian'' in 1955. But he became a staple of screwball comediesin the next two decades in such films as ``The Bad News Bears'' and``The Sunshine Boys.''   Among friends at the tennis club, Matthau also shows many sidesto his personality.   Lifting his cap to examine the emblem, Matthau explains that``Mozart'' is for the composer and not a race horse.   ``I belong to the Mozart Club and you have to listen to 25 hoursa week of his music to join,'' he says.   ``On my way here I was listening to his 24th piano concerto in aminor key,'' he says, humming a few bars. ``Mozart was the onlycomposer who knew how to write music. Everyone else is a clumsyoaf.''   Matthau says he conducts the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra andthe Beverly Hills Symphony for ``about 10 minutes'' once a year.   Matthau had met the day before with playwright Neil Simon,producer Howard Koch and Jack Lemmon to talk about a movie sequelto ``The Odd Couple,'' the popular comedy about hopelesslymismatched roommates.   ``It's 25 years later and we see what's happening to `The OddCouple,''' says Matthau, who was the sloppy Oscar to Lemmon'sfastidious Felix in the 1968 movie version of Simon's Broadwaycomedy. ``Felix's daughter and Oscar's son are getting married.That's how we get together.''   Matthau won a Tony for his role as Oscar in ``The Odd Couple''on Broadway and a Tony for a supporting role in ``A Shot in theDark.'' He received an Academy Award as best supporting actorplaying with Lemmon in the 1966 movie ``Fortune Cookie'' _portraying a lawyer who mixed greed and goofiness.   The television movie is Matthau's first return to the medium ina dramatic role since the 1970s. On PBS's ``Hollywood TelevisionTheatre'' in the 1970s he played Boris Thomashefsky, an actor inthe Jewish theater, in a play about Paul Muni. He recalls that henarrated a PBS series on Shakespeare about 20 years ago. He starredin the syndicated series ``Tallahassee 7000'' in 1961. He wasoffered the role of Oscar in the series version of ``The OddCouple,'' but turned it down.   Matthau's most recent American feature film was ``Couch Trip''two years ago. Then he went to Italy to make ``Little Devils.''   In ``Little Devils,'' he co-stars with Robert Benign. ``I play apriest who exorcises the devil from this woman,'' he says. ``Thenthe devil and I sort of pal around like `The Odd Couple.' It didbig business in Italy.''   Matthau isn't sure what he's going to do next.   ``Maybe I ought to do a play,'' he says. ``I'm getting tired ofwaiting for a good script. I'll probably do more television. I'mtrying to do something with a little merit. I read a TV moviescript the other day, but they cast it with a younger guy.   ``I've been asked to do a series, but I've sort of cooled thatidea. I don't want to do another series.'' He paused. ``Unlesssomething spectacular comes along. It's difficult to do goodquality scripts every week. The shows with good quality week afterweek are few and far between.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
