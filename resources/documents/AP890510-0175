SIMPSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The leader of Italy's Communists will visit theUnited States next week for the first time, presenting his party asliberal in American terms and even as willing to consider dropping``Communist'' from its name.   Party Secretary Achille Occhetto, who leads the largestCommunist party in the West and the No. 2 party in Italy, said,``It is very important in the United States that one understandsthat our party represents something profoundly original.''   He said his party has fought domestic battles for civil rightsand democratic causes and has criticized Soviet foreign policy.   Still, his party, which claims 1.5 million members, has beenlocked out of Christian Democrat-dominated governments since 1947.   Successive U.S. administrations have viewed the party withsuspicion, favoring a reduction in Communist influence in WesternEurope.   ``I can say that the government of the United States doesn'tshare the values that the Communists set forth, and on this pointour position hasn't changed,'' U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Rabb said inan interview published this week by Epoca magazine.   However, he added, ``Yes, I think it will be good that Occhettolistens to the American point of view, and in this sense he willfind the United States a warm and friendly country,'' Rabb said.   He spoke in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday inCommunist Party headquarters shortly after the government easilysurvived a confidence vote brought by the Communists. They wereprotesting a new health plan that imposes nominal fees forhospitalization and medical tests.   Occhetto, 53, took over the party last July with the mandate toreverse its sagging electoral fortunes. A decade after winningabout a third of the vote and coming to the brink of power, theCommunists have been jolted by a series of electoral drubbings.   The new party secretary has been trying to give the party ayouthful image, allowing himself to be photographed while sailingor while kissing his wife. The party has been jumping on ecologicalissues and debating a name change as part of a wider initiative toforge links with Western European Socialist parties.   The party's daily newspaper even carries the Milan stock marketlistings in a bid to attract the upwardly mobile, who have beengiving their votes to former Premier Bettino Craxi's Socialists.   ``If I can translate it into American (terms), our party is aliberal party,'' said Occhetto.   He acknowledged that in the United States, the word``communist'' is often synonomous with Eastern Europe. He said heintends to project an image of a party ``that uses democraticmethods to reform society.''   Occhetto also said his party supports Italy's membership in theWestern NATO alliance.   He leaves for New York on Monday with Giorgio Napolitano, aparty foreign policy specialist, who will interpret for him.   They have no meetings lined up with Bush administrationofficials. However, Occhetto is scheduled to talk with leaders ofthe House and Senate, meet with the editorial boards of The NewYork Times and The Washington Post, and give speeches in Washingtonand New York, according to his aides.</TEXT></DOC>
