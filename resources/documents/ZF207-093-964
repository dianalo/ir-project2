Rosinski, director of the Officeof Federal Acquisition and Regulatory Policy.andP;  He said the civilian andDefense Department FAR councils are negotiating the regulation.andP;  He did notspecify a target date, but said, &quot;I hope we are in the final draft stage.&quot;andM;In the meantime, a GSA official said, it is up to individual agencies todetermine whether they legally can buy computers, printers,telecommunications equipment or other products manufactured by Toshiba Corp.andO;of Japan.andP;  Those products are sold in the United States by divisions ofToshiba America Inc., a Toshiba Corp. subsidiary.andM;Until the FAR is published, contracting officers must rely primarily onguidelines the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued toexecutive agencies in mid-January, said Linda Klein, a GSA FAR analyst.andM;In addition, Klein said, GSA has prepared a draft FAR and cover memo toprovide in-house guidance until the final FAR is approved.andP;  She said shebelieves other agencies also may have distributed that memo.andM;&quot;Completion of the FAR coverage is a priority case,&quot; Klein said.andM;OFPP, part of the Office of Management and Budget, issued the guidelinesafter President Reagan signed an executive order to help carry out theOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, which put the ban into law.andM;The sanctions took effect Dec. 28, 1988, the day after Reagan signed theorder.andP;  They apply to all executive-branch agencies and expire in threeyears.andP;  The Defense Department in March 1987 issued regulations prohibitingpurchases.andM;The ban came after Toshiba Machine Co., a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp., soldsophisticated milling machinery to the Soviet Union.andP;  It also affect productsfrom two Norwegian companies, Kongsberg Trading Co. and KongsbergVaapenfabrikk.andM;Toshiba Corp. products have fallen under other U.S.andP;  sanctions since March1987 as a result of tariffs instituted on computers because of Japanesedumping of computer chips in the U.S.andP;  As a result, Toshiba America has beenassembling most Toshiba laptop computers in the United States.andM;Because the trade act offers exemptions, Toshiba America products may notnecessarily be banned unless the company is selling products made by thesanctioned subsidiaries, said OFPP's Chuch Clark.andM;Spare parts and components are exempt.andP;  The act also excepts productsassembled from Toshiba Corp. parts as long as they are &quot;substantiallytransformed&quot; by another company.andP;  That could include computers, Clark said,but until the revised Far is issued, individual agencies are in gray areas.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
