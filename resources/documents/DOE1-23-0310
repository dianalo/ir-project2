The software provides a tool forestimating the potential production cost impact of combined-cycle aswell as alternative phased GCC construction options including estimatesof unit availability, overall plant capacity, heat rate and fuel mix.The software logic has been incorporated into a widely used productioncosting computer program (PROMOD III) that is employed by many utilitiesto analyze system generation expansion plans. The software is designedto capture the unique characteristics of the GCC technology and maintainthe same relative level of detail as used to describe conventional generationplants in the computer program. Five unique features of GCC plants whichdistinguish them from conventional generation form the framework of thesoftware. First, the ability to recognize backup fuel-firing capabilityis incorporated. Second, the software specifically recognizes the modularityof the GCC technology and performs dispatch based on the recognitionthat when the plant fails, it is in various modes of partial outage ratherthan a full forced outage state. Third, the software identifies plantcapacity and heat rate differences by distinguishing between the twopower sources within the GCC and the availability of the gasificationequipment. Fourth, the development of a separate dispatch segment reflectsthe supplemental firing feature which allows the introduction of fueldirectly into the heat recovery steam generator. Finally, the systemis designed to distinguish between GCC design configurations. Computercalculations of capacities, heat rates and availabilities are reportedin a form which facilitates use of the software for exploring data consistencyand probabilistic calculations. 13 figs., 45 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
