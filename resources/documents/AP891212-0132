AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The five Central American presidentsdemanded Tuesday that the region's two major guerrilla armies bedisbanded and asked for greater international involvement in thesearch for peace.   But skepticism surfaced quickly as to how effective theagreement would be. ``I do not trust Daniel Ortega,'' saidSalvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani.   Cristiani spoke hours after he, Nicaragua's Ortega and the threeother presidents signed a statement critical of El Salvador'srebels. Nicaragua steadfastly supported the leftist rebels in thepast.   The presidents implicitly chided the United States, the SovietUnion and Cuba by asking that ``nations with interests in theregion'' get more directly involved in the peace process. They alsorequested increased U.N. involvement in the effort to demobilize``irregular forces.''   The two-day summit was the latest in a series that often raisedhopes but failed to bring peace to Central America. PresidentsOrtega, Cristiani, Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras, Vinicio Cerezo ofGuatemala and host Oscar Arias of Costa Rica attended.   The joint condemnation of guerrillas was viewed as a victory forCristiani and Ortega, but skeptics noted once again that neither ofthe rebel armies concerned _ Nicaragua's U.S.-backed Contras and ElSalvador's leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, orFMLN _ was represented.   ``This continues to be the problem with all Central Americanaccords,'' said Luis Sanchez Sancho of the National OppositionUnion, a coalition that opposes Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistagovernment in elections set for Feb. 25.   ``The FMLN can't be demobilized by an agreement amonggovernments because it is legitimate force with popular supportthroughout El Salvador,'' the Salvadoran rebels said in a statement.   A Contras spokesman said they would not lay down arms until theycould be certain that Ortega's promises of democratization andtolerance were real.   ``The presidents talked only about hypothetical situations thatdon't correspond to reality,'' Luis Frey, known as CommanderJohnson, added in an interview with the The Associated Press inTegucigalpa, Honduras.   The presidents appeared to concede, with their calls forincreased involvement by other nations and by U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, that they cannot bringpeace to the region by themselves .   The United States still supports the Contras with non-lethal aidand wants them to remain a force at least until the Februaryelections.   The Soviet Union has reportedly scolded Cuba and Nicaragua forshipping anti-aircraft weapons to the FMLN.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ofthe pact, ``We're certainly skeptical. We remain to be convinced.''   He said evidence exists that Nicaragua is not willing to live upto its commitments about democratic reforms. But Fitzwater termed``encouraging'' Nicaragua's agreement not to support Salvadoranrebels.   Cristiani told a news conference after returning home thatOrtega's record made U.N. involvement all the more important.   ``The more he violates agreements such as these, the more hisown image will deteriorate rapidly,'' Cristiani said.   For his part, Ortega asked the United States to ``support andrespect this accord, and to halt its sabotage.''   The presidents called before for demobilization of the Contras,but Tuesday was the first time they made a parallel call fordemobilization of the FMLN.   The five ``energetically demanded'' that the Salvadoran rebels``renounce all violence that directly or indirectly affects thecivilian population,'' a reference to last month's urban offensivethat embarrassed the right-wing Salvadoran government and left morethan 1,000 dead.   The rebels reacted quickly, saying the declaration failed torecognize the Cristiani government had ``bombed civilians'' and``assassinated and persecuted the religious community,'' areference in part to the unsolved murders of six Jesuit priestslast month.   The agreement was seen as a slap in the face for the FMLNbecause it was signed by Ortega, their ally and supporter. Rebelspokesman Antonio Hernandez refused comment when asked in MexicoCity if Ortega had sold them out.   ``It has to be seen in the context of the summit,'' he said.   The rebel statement said the accord helped the Salvadorangovernment ``in exchange for a new promise to immediatelydemobilize the Nicaraguan Contras.''   The presidents asked U.N. help to cut off arms supplies to rebelforces but omitted direct reference to Nicaragua despite the recentdiscovery of two planes and a truck smuggling arms into El Salvador.   The declaration also made no reference to increasing electionviolence in Nicaragua that threatens to jeopardize the free anddemocratic vote promised by the Sandinistas for February.   Those elections were called in exchange for an August agreementto disband the Contras by Dec. 5; the new agreement offers theContras a chance to participate in elections if they repatriatethemselves by Feb. 5.</TEXT></DOC>
