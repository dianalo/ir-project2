The dollar barely moved from Friday's levels all day. It was supported partly by the expectation that the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will reaffirm the Louvre currency-stabilization agreement by year end. Such a joint statement by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada is believed to be conditioned on passage of legislation pending in Congress to reduce the U.S. budget deficit.    However, many dealers voiced skepticism about the depth of the dollar's support at current levels and predicted a continuation of its downward trend next year, with or without a reaffirmation of the Louvre accord.    &quot;In the new year, we'll test whatever is in the (Group of Seven) communique to support the dollar,&quot; Martin L. McNulty, vice president, foreign exchange, for Lloyds Bank PLC in New York, said.    A West German government spokesman said yesterday that finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the seven nations were discussing a draft statement on economic and monetary coordination. But he said they hadn't made any decisions about the timing of any such statement.    Although currency traders said they would expect the dollar to react positively to such a statement, they also voiced doubt that it would have the kind of long-term effect on the market that the original Louvre accord had after it was signed in February. For nearly nine months after that, the dollar's fluctuations were confined to a relatively narrow range.    &quot;We'll probably see some kind of a statement giving verbal support for the dollar,&quot; John Lynam, vice president, foreign exchange, at Security Pacific National Bank, New York, said. &quot;That'll give a temporary boost to the dollar.&quot;    But &quot;the trade deficit is still here,&quot; he said, referring to the U.S. merchandise trade gap, which has been blamed for much of the dollar's current decline. &quot;I think people will look to sell dollars on any dollar strength&quot; after a Group of Seven announcement, Mr. Lynam said.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.6280 West German marks, compared with 1.6335 late Friday. The currency also slipped to 126.56 Japanese yen from 127.00 Friday. The British pound climbed to $1.8318 from $1.8230.    The dollar was quoted at 126.45 yen in early Tokyo trading Tuesday.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 20 cents an ounce to $479.60 in light trading. Estimated volume was 1.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $481.19 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                      Monday, Dec. 21, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
