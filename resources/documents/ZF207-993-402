(overview of the factorylocal area network market)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Cleaveland, Peter.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A survey of experts in the field of industrial or factory-floorlocal area networks (LANs) reveals that production MAP(Manufacturing Automation Protocol), ARCNET and fiber optic LANsare gradually being implemented, but Ethernet, DECnet and IBM SNA(Systems Network Architecture) LANs still dominate the industrialnetworking market.andP;  There are only about 20 production MAPinstallations worldwide, but the six-year freeze on the MAP 3.0standard should promote significant growth.andP;  The ARCNET and20M-bit-per-second ARCNET Plus token-passing star networks offerprogram-to-program communication between UNIX, VAX/VMS, MSDOS andOS/2 operating systems.andP;  Fiber-optic networks are beginning toenter the factory and LAN backbone applications via the FiberDistributed Data Interface standard.andP;  Trends in the integration ofdifferent LAN technologies are discussed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Local Area NetworksTrendsManufacturing Automation Protocol (Computer Network Protocol)Fiber OpticsComputer-Aided ManufacturingFactory ManagementMarket Analysis.andO;Feature:   illustrationchartgraph.andO;Caption:   An integrated communication system for the factory floor.
