(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rockwood Insurance Co. has agreed to paymore than $1 million to settle lawsuits involving E.F. Hutton Groupin a complex mortgage insurance case, Rockwood officials announcedMonday.   Robert E. Lauterbach, a member of Rockwood's board and chairmanof its executive committee, said the settlement included a paymentof $550,000 on Monday plus $200,000 annually for three yearsbeginning in 1989. The agreement also provided for both parties tomutually release all outstanding liabilities.   ``The payments are a modest settlement to get rid of all thelitigation,'' Lauterbach said. ``We felt it was worthwhile tosettle it and get it behind us. We consider this an extremelysatisfactory settlement.''   In 1985, Hutton _ which was acquired earlier this year byShearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. _ announced plans to sueFirst American Mortgage Co. of Maryland in connection with Hutton'spurchase of about $64 million in mortgage loans from FirstAmerican. A major portion of the loans was delinquent, and Huttonclaimed the loans were insured fully by Rockwood.   Subsidiary E.F. Hutton Mortgage Corp. sued Rockwood InsuranceCo. in 1986, seeking recovery under the surety bond issued by thecompany.   The suit demanded Rockwood pay Hutton the amount of theoutstanding balances of all delinquent loans, which then totaledmore than $32 million and with more delinquencies could haveincreased to the full amount of the loans.   Rockwood sued E.F. Hutton Mortgage Corp., allegingnon-compliance and violations of the surety bond and asking thecourt to declare the bond void and unenforceable.   Rockwood Insurance and Rockwood Holding Co. also filed aseparate complaint seeking damages from E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. and itsparent, E.F. Hutton Group, in connection with the transactionsbetween Hutton Mortgage, First American Mortgage and RockwoodInsurance.   In May, a federal judge dismissed Hutton's motions to haveRockwood's complaints dismissed and Rockwood's motion to dismissthe Hutton complaint.   Lauterbach said that since the litigation the company hasstopped writing financial insurance, such as the mortgage insurancethat was at issue in the Hutton litigation.</TEXT></DOC>
