SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robin Higgins, in a moving salute to herhusband last week, spoke of the ``virtual certainty'' he'd beenkilled at the hands of his Lebanese terrorist kidnappers.   Mrs. Higgins made the announcement nearly 18 months after Lt.Col. William Higgins was taken captive and following an exhaustiveFBI study of a videotape released by his kidnappers, whichpurported to show Higgins' body, bound and gagged and hanging froma makeshift gallows.   But no corpse was made available to U.S. officials _ and a U.N.official who traveled to Beirut to search for the body returnedempty-handed _ so it appears a formal declaration of death could besome time coming.   The problem is a familiar one to other U.S. military familieswho struggled with uncertainty regarding the fate of their lovedones.   Since World War I, the Pentagon lists approximately 92,000troops as missing in action. Much attention has been focusedrecently on the 2,344 military personnel still unaccounted for fromthe Vietnam War.   ``It's a very difficult problem to deal with, emotionally andlegally,'' said Betsy Cox, spokeswoman for the National League ofFamilies of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.   ``This is a particularly tragic situation. It looks like Col.Higgins was killed, but there's still that degree of doubt,'' saidMs. Cox.   The spokeswoman said Mrs. Higgins, herself a Marine major,appeared at a recent event and sponsored by her organization andattended by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.   ``Maj. Higgins has been very supportive of our group throughouther ordeal. ... I can see where she would gain some comfort frombeing with POW@MIA (prisoner of war, missing in action) families,''Ms. Cox said.   Even when there is a formal declaration of death of a loved onewho has been missing, sometimes family members cling to the chancea mistake has been made, said Carmella LaSpada, a spokeswoman for aNo Greater Love, a support organization for families of missingsoldiers.   ``Hope is a cheater. If no one knows for sure, it's always verydistressing for the family,'' she said.   Lt. Col. Fred Peck, a Marine Corps spokesman, said the decisionto declare a serviceman or woman dead is up to the servicesecretary. In Higgins' case, it has been delegated to Gen. AlfredM. Gray, the commandant of the Marine Corps.   Gray ``has taken a close personal interest'' in the case and``has taken Robin under his wing,'' said Peck.   But before making any decision, Gray has indicated more workneeds to be done, Peck said.   The commandant, who personally informed Mrs. Higgins of the gistof the FBI's report, has asked to see the bureau's complete writtenstudy, and has requested a personal briefing as well.   Gray intends to speak with the U.N. official who traveled insearch of Higgins body, Marrack Goulding, and also meet with theMarine Corps' lawyers about the case.   ``He also intends to speak with Robin again. There is nothingcompelling him to arrive at a decision at any specified time,''Peck said.   No plans have been made for any memorial service, he added.   ``We really don't know when the situation will change.Bascially, it's open-ended for now,'' Peck said.   There is a formal process under which a formal declaration ofdeath is made and the families concerned are invited to participatein _ or contest _ the process, Peck said.   Each is handled on a case-by-case basis, he said.   Up until a declaration is made, the surviving spouse continuesto draw the full pay and allowances due the serviceman or woman.When the declaration is made, the pay stops and ``the account issettled,'' Peck said.   That includes such things as life insurance payments _ mostservicemen carry the $50,000 group life insurance policy thatHiggins had _ payment for any leave accrued, and payment ofsurvivor's benefits of approximately $1,000 a month for life,unless the spouse decides to remarry, Peck said.   Mrs. Higgins hasn't ever mentioned the financial aspects of herhusbands'situation, the spokesman said.   ``That's been the least of her worries,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
