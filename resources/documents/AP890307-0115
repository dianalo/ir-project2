The president defended his conduct in not making a big issue ofan incident in which Chinese police prevented dissident Fang Lizhifrom attending a barbecue in Beijing last week hosted by Bush.   Fang had been on Bush's invitation list.   ``The very invitation to that dissident that they thoroughlydisapproved of shows our public commitment to it (human rights),''Bush said.   Reagan raised human rights issues in each of his meetings withSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and once invited a group ofSoviet dissidents to meet with him in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.   On a trip to China in 1984, Reagan protested angrily when Chineseauthorities censored parts of his nationally televised address,including a portion dealing with religion.   Still, Bush sought to draw a parallel between his ownpresentation of human-rights concerns in meetings with foreignleaders and Reagan's approach.   ``You know, there's two schools of how you do the human rightsagenda,'' he said. ``I think that President Reagan was correct whenhe raised the human rights agenda with the Soviets privately ratherthan beating his breast and doing it publicly.''   ``And I think the results have been rather penetrating, still along way to go with the Soviets,'' Bush said.   During his China trip, Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater,said that Bush had not raised the issues of human rights withChinese leaders _ presumably including the key issue of human rightsin Tibet, scene of recent clashes between police and rioters seekingindependence from Beijing.   China on Tuesday imposed martial law in the Tibetan capital ofLhasa after three days of anti-Chinese rioting.   Bush on Tuesday said that the press secretary's statement wastrue up the point that Fitzwater spoke, but that he later raised thegeneral issue in a private meeting with Chinese senior leader DengXiaopeng.   ``It was raised by me personally,'' he said.   On the subject of linking economic concessions to the Soviets tohuman-rights progress, including an easing of emigrationrestrictions on Soviet Jews, Bush said: ``There's clearly got to besome linkage.''   ``When Soviets come out of Afghanistan, which happened here notso long ago, give them credit for that. When you get some lighteningup a little bit on the question of Soviet Jews or something of thatnature, give some credit,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
