In one of the last actions of this Congress, the tax bill was passed by the House on a vote of 358-1. The Senate approved the measure by voice vote early Saturday morning.    &quot;There's no doubt the president will sign it,&quot; Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), who managed the bill in the Senate, said after the vote.    Most of the revenue-raising provisions in the tax bill are acceptable to the Reagan administration, especially because they would pay for some sought-after extensions of expiring tax breaks and for technical corrections to the 1986 tax-overhaul law. The bill also would remove the limit on the amount of long-term bonds the Treasury can issue, which the administration sought for financing the national debt.    &quot;This legislation is long overdue and will be a great help to many taxpayers,&quot; said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.    The strong support for the bill stemmed from the eagerness of lawmakers to give a variety of tax breaks to such groups as farmers, authors and mutual fund shareholders. It would also create a &quot;taxpayer bill of rights&quot; favored by both major presidential candidates. The bill would hit military contractors, who were an easy target in the wake of the Pentagon procurement scandal.    After a week of deadlock between House and Senate conferees over the size and shape of a tax bill, a breakthrough occurred late last week when the House said it would accept a tax increase of $4.1 billion over three years, a significant compromise from the $7.5 billion called for in the House-passed bill. The Senate version would have increased taxes by $2.5 billion for the same period.    The Senate conferees largely concurred in the size of the package, so both sides spent all of Friday haggling over details. A conference agreement was reached shortly before midnight Friday, and within a few hours, both houses had approved it.    The bill would raise taxes by accelerating corporate estimated tax payments, restricting the sale of tax breaks by Alaskan native corporations and curbing life-insurance policies that can serve as tax shelters.    The most controversial tax increase in the package would hit defense companies and other long-term contractors, raising their taxes by $1.3 billion over three years. The House bill would have ended a tax-deferral technique known as the completed-contract method of accounting, under which contractors can postpone paying a portion of their taxes until the contract is completed. The Senate strongly opposed the provision.    Under the conference agreement, long-term contractors can defer only 10% of taxes on income from a contract, rather than the 30% currently allowed. The agreement would exempt contracts for residential housing.    The bill would raise taxes on individuals who use their homes as their offices. It would prohibit any deduction of the base cost of a telephone that is also used for personal purposes. And the bill would impose a new tax of 45 cents a pound on pipe tobacco.    Another provision would place a temporary 15% excise tax on a company's withdrawals of excess pension assets. This is designed to discourage use of the excess assets by the company or an acquirer of the company.    The conferees dropped a House provision that would have raised taxes on corporations that own stock in other corporations.    The tax benefits in the bill include:   --Exempting mutual funds from a provision of the 1986 tax law that required certain investment expenses to be deducted by individual shareholders rather than by the fund itself. Shareholders had to count these expenses as miscellaneous itemized deductions, which may be taken only to the extent that they exceed 2% of the taxpayer's income. This had the effect of making the shareholders pay a part of the fund's operating expenses. Congress passed an exemption for 1987, and this bill would extend the exemption through 1989.    --Extending through 1989 the 20% research and development tax credit that is scheduled to expire at year-end.    --Extending tax breaks for thrifts that rescue troubled thrifts through the first half of 1989. It also would provide the same tax incentive to healthy banks that take over troubled banks.    --Extending a tax break for employer-provided education expenses through the end of this year.    --Establishing a taxpayer bill of rights, designed to bolster taxpayers' rights in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service. &quot;Taxpayers who are victimized by the IRS can now fight back,&quot; David Keating, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, said after congressional approval.    --Extending a provision that eases the tax treatment of research and development expenses that support foreign operations, effective for four months.    --Extending a credit given to employers who hire economically disadvantaged workers through 1989.    --Exempting free-lance writers, artists and some livestock producers from a rule that bars taxpayers from deducting certain production expenses before a project produces income.    --Keeping farmers from having to pay the diesel-fuel highway tax for fuel used off the road.    --Liberalizing the tax credit for low-income housing.    --Allowing families to avoid tax on interest earned on U.S. savings bonds redeemed to pay for college or vocational education.    --Allowing farmers who are forced by drought to sell livestock to delay tax on that income for a year. It also would allow farmers who received drought-assistance payments to defer income tax on them for one year.    --Preventing recognition of taxable gain on the sale of a personal residence for anyone 55 or older if the house had to be sold because the person has become incapacitated.    The conferees deleted a provision that would have allowed a medical-expense deduction for costs incurred to eliminate radon-gas levels. </TEXT></DOC>
