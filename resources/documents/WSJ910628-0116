Alexander Hamilton, the U.S. foundingfather, might have found a more eloquent turn of phase, butthe message is nonetheless revolutionary. The 134 typewrittenpages that follow are the first complete official draft ofthe EC's new treaties on political, economic and monetaryunion. They outline structures, institutions anddecision-making procedures designed to make the EC and itsmember states more confident actors both at home and abroad.   The treaty, parts of which will form the basis ofdiscussions this weekend at a two-day EC summit, stops wellshort of creating a true United States of Europe. There won'tbe a single European president, nor a single governmentdominated by one party or coalition. The European Parliamentwill remain an institution that spends much time fighting togive itself more power. And any new executive powers grantedthe EC Commission will be balanced by a more powerful Councilof Ministers, made up of national representatives. Indeed,the national governments still will dominate the EC andcontinue to take turns playing president.   All these qualifications notwithstanding, the result willbe a more muscular EC. It will be able to make faster andbolder decisions because no single member will as easily tripit up. For example, France could not again join a common EC&quot;no further negotiations&quot; policy toward Iraq, as it did inJanuary, and then hours later seek a separate, independentsettlement. The treaty includes new legal constraints againstsuch behavior.   The theory behind it all is to make it easier to strike ECagreements on issues that choke the present system. Majorityvoting under the 1992 single-market program allowed a newpush toward the single market; now most EC countries want todo the same for other problems.   If the system works, the community has a long list ofprograms to tackle. It could begin cleaning its filthy airand water, make backwards and overpriced telephone companiescompete or let citizens go shopping across borders withoutfear of customs police. It might chop the costs andinefficiencies of running 12 bureaucratic and overstaffedgovernments that duplicate many tasks. And it might choose tohave a single currency, abolishing the need for coinsunwanted outside their countries of origin.   Much detailed negotiation remains. But the Luxembourgdraft has been accepted by all 12 governments as the workingdocument for the final treaty, and foreign ministers haveagreed to finish the text by year end. Here is a briefoutline of what it contains:                                                                                                          PREAMBLE. This sets out the long-term goal of&quot;federalism,&quot; which Britain continues to oppose. They fearthat the word commits the EC nations to create a realEuropean government; other nations hope it does. That termeventually may be replaced, but advocates of a United Statesof Europe want a strong statement of their long-term goal.   The preamble also deals with another controversy thatcouldn't be settled in the text itself. Belgium, Italy,Germany and the Netherlands originally wanted the entirepolitical and monetary union treaty to be incorporated intothe Treaty of Rome, which founded the EC back in 1957. Theysay that treaty strikes a good balance between national andEuropean-level powers, and illustrates the checks andbalances needed for good democratic government. But Franceand Britain weren't ready to unify the EC fully under anexpanded and updated version of the founding treaty.   Instead, the preamble lists three separate &quot;pillars&quot; forinternal market issues, foreign and security policies andjudicial affairs, plus a commitment eventually to combinethese into one.                                                                                                          PILLAR 1: The Treaty of Rome.   This section, more than two-thirds of the entire document,modifies the original Rome treaty by adding economic andmonetary union, an unspecified &quot;high level of socialprotection&quot; and a commitment to converge the EC economies. Itcreates EC-wide citizenship for such things as voting inlocal elections. It introduces new powers over environmentalaffairs, energy policy, transport, education, consumerprotection, tourism and civil defense. It also empowers theEC to fund major pan-European infrastructure projects intransport, telecommunication and energy, and to build&quot;bridges&quot; among national systems.   Its 12 pages on economic and monetary union foreseecreation of a central banking system on Jan. 1, 1994, butstate this bank won't gain formal powers until Jan 1, 1996.It also says the ECU will become the single EC currency ifthere is a unanimous decision by all member statesparticipating in the final phase.   The new European Central bank is to remain free ofinterference by governments or EC institutions, but will berequired to make an annual report on its activities to thecouncil of Ministers and the European Parliament, which candebate its policies.                                                                                                          PILLAR 2: Foreign and Security Policy.   &quot;The Union and its member states shall define andimplement a common foreign and security policy with the aimof reinforcing the identity and role of the union as apolitical entity on the international scene. The policy ofthe union can extend to all areas of foreign and securitypolicy.&quot; The document also calls for &quot;the definition overtime of a policy of defense.&quot;   This pillar will streamline the policy-making system andcurb the ability of any single country to block adoption ofoverall EC policies. If the Council of Ministers decides totake joint action on a diplomatic question, it may alsodecide to adopt the detailed decisions required by majorityvoting.   Under the treaty, any decisions taken by EC ministerscould be &quot;wholly or partially implemented&quot; by the EC'sdefense affiliate, the Western European Union. But the ECcouldn't require the WEU, which has a separate legal status,to act. Steps toward a European defense policy should betaken in a subsequent treaty revision in 1996, the documentsays. Britain and the Netherlands oppose this because theyfear it will reopen the controversy about the role of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the U.S.'s influencein Europe. They want to preserve the status quo.                                                                                                          PILLAR 3: Judicial Cooperation.   This section seeks to improve coordination of nationalpolice forces and judicial authorities to battle pan-Europeandrug traffickers, terrorists and illegal immigrants. It wasmade a separate pillar because some countries felt theseissues shouldn't be included in the Treaty of Rome itself;that, they argued, would have reduced national control inthis field. Britain and France, in particular, are reluctantto allow other EC countries to have influence over its policeor security forces.                                                                                                          FINAL PROVISIONS. The British also oppose a closingarticle that calls for a treaty revision in 1996 to carry out&quot;strengthening the federal character of the union.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
