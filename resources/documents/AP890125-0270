Nopickup. ^By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita today rejectedopposition calls for him to quit after a third member of his Cabinetresigned over links to a company at the center of a stock-tradingscandal.   Also today, the Labor Ministry announced the resignations of itstwo top bureaucrats who also have been linked to the company.   Takeshita, scheduled to travel to Washington in a week for ameeting with President Bush, was hit Tuesday with the resignation ofKen Harada from the Cabinet post of director general of the EconomicPlanning Agency.   Harada, 69, had been appointed Dec. 27 when Takeshita brought 15new faces into his scandal-plagued administration in an effort toerase the taint of money links to the Recruit Co., aninformation-based conglomerate.   But Takeshita's justice minister, Takashi Hasegawa, resignedafter only three days and now Harada has quit. In the case of bothmen, news reports had revealed that they continued to take politicaldonations from Recruit months after the scandal became front-pagenews last summer.   In December, Kiichi Miyazawa resigned as finance minister afterhaving repeatedly changed his story on how an aide used his name tobuy shares in the Recruit subsidiary.   The largest opposition party, the Japan Socialist Party, endedits three-day convention today with a resolution to try to forceTakeshita's Liberal Democratic Party to hold new elections.   Asked about opposition calls for him to resign and call earlyelections, Takeshita told Japanese reporters: ``That's a matter forme to judge.''   He said he was ``resolved to cope'' with an expected difficultlegislature when the Diet, or parliament, convenes next month todebate the government's proposed budget of $471.95 billion.   Scandal has dogged the governing Liberal Democratic Party sincean ever-widening web of dubious money links began to emerge betweenRecruit Co. and prominent people in politics, business and the newsmedia.   The company had offered prelisted shares in a real-estatesubsidiary to the prominent people at bargain prices, and theyprofited handsomely by selling after the shares went on the marketin October 1986.   At least 16 top politicians, including some in oppositionparties, acknowledged that they or their aides benefited in suchdeals.   The transactions were not illegal under Japanese securities law.But they raised suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling andfocused public attention on the close links between business andpolitics.   Further revelations have shown that Recruit also made regulardonations to many politicians. Several members of the servingCabinet have explained that they stopped accepting Recruit moneyafter the scandal broke.   But the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported Tuesday that Harada hadreceived $80 a month from Recruit for 14 years until November, eventhough he had become chairman of a special parliamentary committeeexamining the Recruit scandal. The newspaper also reported thatRecruit bought $8,000 worth of tickets to a Harada fund-raisingparty in August.   In his resignation statement, Harada acknowledged receivingdonations but denied the company had sought any favors or that hehad done anything wrong.   At the Labor Ministry today, Vice Labor Minister Yoshiro Okai andMasayuki Nomiyama, director general of the Labor Standards Bureau,resigned.   Although both had acknowledged accepting favors from Recruit _dinners in expensive restaurants and golf outings _ the ministrysaid the resignations were routine personnel changes and not relatedto the scandal.   The Labor Ministry has responsibility for supervising Recruit'smajor line of business in the personnel and employment-informationfields, and is being investigated by prosecutors for possiblebribery.</TEXT></DOC>
