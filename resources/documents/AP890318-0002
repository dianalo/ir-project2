JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Conservation techniques that were urged duringthe energy shortages of the 70s should be adopted to combat globalwarming caused by pollution, the EPA says.   The Environmental Protection Agency, in a report Friday, outlinedactions such as development of fuel-efficient cars, energy-savinghomes and solar technology, needed by the end of the century tocurtail global warming. They say such warming will occur unless airpollution is reduced.   In its report to the Senate subcommittee on environmentalprotection, the EPA said most scientists agree that without actionto reduce pollution, the Earth can be expected to warm by 4 to 11degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years.   ``There's no doubt there is a consensus that the greenhousephenomenon is very real,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., thesubcommittee chairman after hearing EPA Administrator William K.Reilly summarize the EPA report.   Scientists believe that a variety of pollutants are causing a``greenhouse effect'' that traps the sun's infrared radiation,instead of allowing it to go back into space, resulting in increasedwarming. The gases most responsible for the warming are carbondioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxides.   The EPA report said ``no single technology or policy can havesignificant impact in mitigating the accumulation of greenhousegases'' because of their wide use. Instead, it said, that only bydealing with the problem broadly can there be significant reductions.   The recommendations outlined in the EPA report will be used byboth the administration and Congress to assess what kinds ofregulatory action or legislation might be needed on global warming.   One focus, the agency said, must be aimed at reducing the use offossil fuels, which produce carbon dioxide, by far the largestsingle contributor to global warming. Last decade, the high cost ofsuch fuels and the easy shutoff of foreign sources promptedconservation moves.   To curtail energy use, the report proposed:   _Increasing average automobile fuel economy levels to 40 milesper gallon by the year 2000. This is in sharp contrast to the Reaganadministration, which in recent years has urged elimination offederal fuel economy standards and accommodated auto industryrequests not to set fleetwide standards above 26.5 mpg.   _Taking measures to make new single family homes more energyefficient so that on average they will use 50 percent less fuel heatin the year 2000 than the average in 1980.   _Setting fees of 7 percent to 20 percent on carbon emissions fromnatural gas, oil and coal to encourage less use of those fossilfuels.   The EPA also suggested increasing research into solar technologyso it competes with oil and gas and pushing to get all industrialcountries to require catalytic converters similar to those requiredin U.S. automobiles.   But the report emphasized that increased energy efficiency willnot in itself provide the total answer. It said efforts must be madeto:   _Stop the loss of forests around the world by beginning in 1990 aprogram aimed at planting at least as many trees as are cut down ordestroyed. Trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, keeping the gasfrom getting into the atmosphere.   _End the use of chlorofluorocarbons by all industrializedcountries over the next 14 years and take action to sharply curtailthe chemical's use by developing countries.   The Bush administration and the Western European countriesrecently agreed to phase out use of such gases, which contribute todepletion of the world's ozone layer and are believed to be a majorcontributor to global warming.</TEXT></DOC>
