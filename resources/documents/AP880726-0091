We can expect, and indeed, toleratenothing less from the people who work for the government,'' thevice president said.   Bush, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, discussed thesubject of ethics and standards of conduct in a speech to agathering of congressional interns at the Library of Congress. Itcomes on the heels of Democrats' charges of ``sleaze'' in theReagan administration.   Bush said that in his many years of government he has been``guided by a moral compass of decency, integrity, fairness andpublic purpose.''   He said his philosophy is ``it's a privilege to serve, it's anhonor to hold the public trust and it's a disgrace to violate it.''   Bush said that as president he would establish an office ofsenior counselor to the president whose first responsibility wouldbe ethics. He said the counselor would be in charge of a WhiteHouse ethics office that would complement the work of the existingOffice of Government Ethics.   Bush complained that the present system of federal ethics law``is a confused quiltwork of executive policy statements,administrative regulations, criminal laws. Indeed, virtually everyagency of government issues its own set of standards of conduct.''   He said that under his administration the code of conduct wouldbe clear, uniform and reflect common sense. ``Nothing will beoverly technical. What is intuitively right _ what your consciencetells you _ will invariably be the written rule,'' he said.   He said the standards he would prescribe would eliminate``needless restrictions'' to avoid discouraging good people fromserving in government.   ``The sanctions imposed by law for breach of the standards ofconduct must be fair and proportionate,'' the vice president said.``Today there is little or no room under the conflicts law for theexercise of discretion and the fashioning of a measured response.   ``To put it in high relief, one is either charged with a felonyor nothing at all,'' Bush said. ``This is plainly unacceptable.''   He said prosecutors should be free to exercise their judgment topursue civil remedies as well as enhance criminal sanctions.   ``A wider variety of misconduct will consequently be reached,with fair and proportionate responses for all,'' he said.   He said the conflict-of-interest statutes must cover members ofCongress. ``To exempt Congress from any of these rules, as doescurrent conflict-of-interest law, is to establish a double standardthat breeds suspicion, breeds cynicism and in my judgment breedsabuse,'' he said.   In a break with the current administration, Bush said, ``Iwhole-heartedly endorse the concept of an independent counsel,''but again said that the independent counsel law should apply tomembers of Congress as well.   More than 100 administration officials have been accused ofwrongdoing during Reagan's term, including some of his closestadvisers, such as Michael Deaver, convicted of three counts ofperjury, and Lyn Nofziger, convicted of three charges that heillegally lobbied the executive branch for private clients.   Bush's speech has been long in the making, but was delayed untilthe release of a report on the investigation of Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III by independent counsel James M. McKay, who foundthat Meese probably broke two tax laws and twice violated acriminal conflict-of-interest statute. However, McKay decided notto prosecute Meese, who is resigning.   Bush, talking with reporters on Air Force II over the weekend,said the Democrats are ``going to try to run against Meese. Hewon't be around.''   The vice president said the Justice Department, in particular,must be above ``even the perception of wrongdoing.''   ``I would have to reluctantly conclude _ reluctantly because Ilike Meese _ that those standards were not met,'' Bush said.   But he said he disagreed with the description of Meese as a``sleaze'' by Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Little in the Wedtechbribery and corruption case in New York.   In accepting the Democratic presidential nomination to runagainst Bush, Michael Dukakis said the government should set highethical standards for itself.   ``We're going to have a Justice Department that isn't thelaughingstock of the nation,'' he said. ``We're going to have aJustice Department that understands what the word `justice' means....   ``And in the Dukakis White House ... if you accept the privilegeof public service, you had better understand the responsibilitiesof public service. If you violate that trust, you'll be fired. Ifyou violate the law, you'll be prosecuted. And if you sell arms tothe ayatollah, don't expect a pardon from the president of theUnited States.''</TEXT></DOC>
