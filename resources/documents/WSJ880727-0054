Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush has begun, subtly but surely, to undermine one of the most significant legacies of the Reagan administration: tax overhaul.    In the last few days, Mr. Bush has proposed two costly new tax breaks as part of his presidential campaign -- a refundable child-care credit and a 10% credit for oil and gas exploration. These, on top of his previous proposals to restore preferential treatment for capital gains and to establish tax-free education savings bonds, amount to a major retreat from the tenets of President Reagan's landmark 1986 tax bill.    The proposals could widen the already huge budget deficit by as much as $10 billion a year. The vice president says he would pay for these changes with unspecified spending cuts. But the tax changes would certainly increase pressure to raise tax rates.    &quot;I'm really very disappointed,&quot; says Roscoe Egger, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service during President Reagan's first term and an advocate of the president's tax-overhaul plan. &quot;You start cluttering up the tax code with some kind of benefit for each and every little social problem and economic problem and you're back to the same old thing again.&quot;    &quot;He's playing the old politics of pandering to the special interests,&quot; charges Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), who was a leading architect of the sweeping tax measure. &quot;He basically wants to return to pre-tax-reform days, which is undoing Ronald Reagan's most significant accomplishment.&quot;    Mr. Bush was always lukewarm toward the tax-overhaul effort, and in private lobbied to save tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. These days, he gives mild support to the legislation, calling it &quot;a good bill, though imperfect&quot; and saying &quot;some tax incentives for business need to be restored.&quot;    Tax overhaul paid for a lowering of tax rates for all individuals and corporations by eliminating many tax breaks that benefited narrower interests. The restoration of tax breaks proposed by Vice President Bush could cause the delicate political compromises of that enterprise to unravel. The unintended consequence could be a widening of the deficit, a trimming back of other tax benefits or an increase in tax rates.    &quot;Congress is going to consider changes in the rates anyway, but if the Republicans open it {tax overhaul} up, it makes it easier for the rates to rise,&quot; says John Chapoton, a former senior Reagan-administration tax official. Perhaps unwittingly, Vice President Bush &quot;is going to raise tax rates on middle-income families,&quot; Sen. Bradley says.    The Bush energy-tax plan wasn't widely distributed, but was unveiled in the heart of oil country as part of a Sunday op-ed piece that ran in the Houston Chronicle under Mr. Bush's byline. The article appeared as polls showed Mr. Bush trailing the Democratic ticket that has Lloyd Bentsen, the popular senator from Texas, as the vice presidential candidate.    In the Houston article, Mr. Bush proposed a tax credit of up to 10% for oil and gas exploration. The credit could be used to offset tax liability incurred under the so-called alternative minimum tax, which was designed to prevent wealthy individuals and corporations from escaping taxes. The amount of the credit would be 10% for costs up to $10 million, and 5% thereafter. The Bush plan also would enable independent oil and gas drillers to deduct almost all of their so-called intangible drilling expenditures, even if the drillers fall under the alternative minimum tax.    The column didn't say how much these generous new energy tax measures would cost, but they clearly were intended to restore tax benefits taken away from independent oil and gas producers by the 1986 tax bill. Government tax experts place the cost of these proposals at perhaps $1 billion a year.    The child-care proposal, which was widely distributed over the weekend, would provide a refundable tax credit to working families with incomes of $10,000 or less, worth $1,000 per child under four years old. The proposal, meant to increase the vice president's popularity among women, might eventually be extended to families with incomes as high as $20,000.    Mr. Bush put the cost of this tax change at $1.9 billion a year. But congressional and private tax experts say that the proposal, even in its initial stages, is likely to cost more than that, and the price tag would more than double if the benefits are extended to families earning between $10,000 and $20,000.    Last year the vice president proposed cutting the capital-gains tax rate to 15% from the current 28%, a move that he claimed would raise revenue for the federal government and stimulate investment. But the revenue effects of the proposal have been hotly debated, and tax estimators both in Congress and at the Treasury say the plan would cost the government billions of dollars.    What isn't disputed is that most of the capital-gains benefit would go to the wealthiest fraction of Americans. For that reason, any effort to cut the capital-gains tax rate is certain to be met by Democratic proposals to raise the top tax rate on individuals.    The educational-savings-bond proposal, which was included in President Reagan's budget for fiscal 1988, is the most modest of the four proposed changes. It would cost an estimated $400 million a year by 1993, according to the Congressional Budget Office.    And there might be more to come. Earlier this month Mr. Bush told a group of agriculture executives that he generally liked the idea of &quot;rural enterprise zones,&quot; which offer federal tax relief as an incentive for companies to locate in economically depressed rural regions.    Together, the proposals suggest that Vice President Bush intends to use the tax code, rather than spending programs, to promote social and economic engineering. Mr. Bush's advisers argue that the tax code is a better way to make such policy because it eliminates the need to set up large new bureaucracies.    On the child-care issue, for instance, the Bush plan in its first year would cost only slightly less than the $2.5 billion child-care plan introduced by congressional Democrats and supported by Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis. But the Bush tax program would allow people to spend the money on whatever type of child care they chose. The Democratic plan, on the other hand, would have the government spend the money directly to fund experimental child-care efforts.    Tax-overhaul advocates complain that the tax code isn't a good tool for social or economic engineering. &quot;It's a strange use of the IRS bureaucracy to run a program on child care,&quot; said Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed tax lobbying group. Some Democrats also complain that using the tax code is a way to conceal the true cost of new programs. &quot;Whether it is money not going into the Treasury or money going out of the Treasury, it is still a loss,&quot; says Rep. Dale Kildee (D., Mich.), a chief sponsor of the Democrats' child-care plan.    For his part, Mr. Bush defends his proposals as needed and stresses that they would be paid for through cuts in spending. The proposals &quot;don't amount to an assault on the current tax structure,&quot; contends Bush spokesman Stephen Hart. &quot;They are laser-like openings in the tax structure for specific reasons,&quot; he says. &quot;All of them have been factored into his 'flexible freeze' {of government spending}. He isn't going to raise taxes, period.&quot;    ---    Bush's Tax Proposals   Estimated revenue loss, per year, inbillions of dollars   Refundable child-care credit   $1.9   Education savings bond         $0.4   Capital gains preference       $4 to $7   Oil and gas exploration credit $1</TEXT></DOC>
