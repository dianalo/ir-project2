Speaking in the ornate Senate Caucus Room, Nobel Peace Prizelaureate the Rev. Desmond Tutu called on the Bush administration totake the ``moral leadership'' and tighten economic pressures onSouth Africa.   ``Your intervention is critical. Apartheid is destroying ourland and our people. Help us. Please help us,'' Tutu told thegathering of 80 lawmakers, governors, academics and businessmen.   Tutu and two other activists, the Rev. Allan Boesak and BeyersNaude, issued a proposal in which they urged the United States toadopt to prompt the South African government to negotiate.   The plan includes an immediate lifting of the state of emergencyimposed by the government, the release of all political prisonersand recognition of the banned African National Congress.   Naude, a white Afrikaner, said the U.S. administration shoulduse the opportunity created by South Africa's severe economichardships to tighten the screws of trade sanctions on South Africa.Without such measures, he said, the government will never grantpolitical rights to the 28 million black South Africans.   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., saying that the fight againstapartheid has become ``the greatest human rights struggle of ourtime,'' urged the Bush administration to work together withCongress on a new strategy toward South Africa.   ``Kinder and gentler does not mean apartheid. Now is the time tomove ahead, not stand in place,'' he said.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he wasencouraged by the openness of the Bush administration as signaledby the presence of Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen at thegathering. Mitchell said Congress and the administration ``agreeupon the end _ abolition of apartheid. We must now reach agreementon the means.''   The Reagan administration fought and lost a bitter battle withCongress in 1986 over sanctions on South Africa.   Kennedy said that ``instead of rushing to refight old battles,we intend to seek new possibilities'' for cooperating with theadministration in U.S. policy toward South Africa.   National Party leader F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to becomeSouth Africa's next leader once President P.W. Botha retires inSeptember, has called for a new political system in his country,although he rejects a one-person, one-vote system espoused byanti-apartheid groups.   There has been speculation de Klerk may come to the UnitedStates for a visit later this year.   State Department officials say the administration has decided tobroaden its contacts with South African leaders across thepolitical spectrum and that a de Klerk visit is possible.   The proposals of the anti-apartheid leadership promptedpublication Tuesday of a Gallup survey showing most South Africansoppose international economic sanctions because they believe thesanctions lead to joblessness rather than political change.   Only one in six blacks said sanctions are a good idea becausethey would force the government to abolish apartheid. Six of 10blacks said they would oppose sanctions even if these led thegovernment to resign within five years.   The survey of 2,192 people _ 1,400 blacks, 392 whites and 400 ofmixed race and Asian origin _ was commissioned by the South AfricanChamber of Mines, representing the country's mining industry.   Of those polled, 82 percent of the blacks and 95 percent of thewhites rejected foreign sanctions, with most saying they would leadto higher unemployment.   Congress imposed limited sanctions on South Africa in 1986,overriding a veto by then-President Reagan, in an effort to forcethe government to grant political rights to the black majority.   The survey, conducted between March 11 and May 8, had a 4percent margin of error. Neil Upmeyer, research director forGallup, said that to ensure credibility of the responses,interviews were conducted away from the work place by interviewerswho were of the same race as the respondent.   In the survey, 59 percent of the blacks and 51 percent of thewhites, and 58 percent of all respondents, said American companiesin South Africa can help make the government moderate its racialpolicies.   Of those polled, 77 percent of blacks and 50 percent of whitessaid ending American business operations would seriously hurt theSouth African economy.</TEXT></DOC>
