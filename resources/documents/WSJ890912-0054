The proposals, scheduled to be released this week and outlined at a joint industry-FAA news conference, are similar to modifications ordered earlier this year for older Boeing Co. aircraft. Both cases mark a striking change in the government's longtime practice of relying almost exclusively on inspections to detect potential safety problems. Applying a new philosophy, the U.S. now is requiring specific, pre-set repairs on geriatric jets.    The proposals for the McDonnell Douglas planes, which are expected to become final rules in three or four months, call for 52 repairs to older DC-8s, 52 to DC-9s, 22 to MD-80s and 33 to DC-10s. Each plane's number of flights would determine whether repairs were needed. For example, most changes on DC-9s would be required on planes with more than 100,000 flights.    The Air Transport Association, the airline industry trade group, estimated that the modifications will cost an average of about $290,000 a plane. It said that 1,900 aircraft throughout the world would be affected, at a total cost of $563 million over the next two decades. Foreign civil-aviation officials are expected to adopt the FAA rules.    According to the FAA, U.S. airlines own 1,153 McDonnell Douglas aircraft, consisting of 218 DC-8s, 568 DC-9s, 173 MD-80s, and 194 DC-10s. All of these planes will be modified eventually. The 100 or so oldest planes will have to be repaired over a four-year period at a cost of $53 million to domestic airlines, the agency said. The rest will be repaired as they age.    Changes will range from minor bolt replacements to the overhaul of DC-9 landing gears. Clyde Kizer, vice president of engineering and maintenance for the Air Transport Association, said the planes targeted for changes are currently safe.    &quot;What we are doing is trying to prevent problems in the future,&quot; he said. &quot;None of these problems exist today.&quot;    But he and other officials acknowledged that the new philosophy of predesignated repairs is an implicit admission that repetitive inspections alone can't guarantee the safety of planes being used much longer than their designers ever expected.    Public concern about the safety of older airliners surged in the wake of a bizarre accident in April 1988 in which a part of a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 ripped off over Hawaii, killing a flight attendant. At the urging of the FAA, the industry convened experts to review the potential hazards posed by the aging of the fleet. Later this year, the group will recommend repairs to planes made by Lockheed Corp., Airbus Industrie, Fokker Aircraft B.V. and British Aerospace PLC. </TEXT></DOC>
