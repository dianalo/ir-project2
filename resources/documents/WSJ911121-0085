Alec Jeffreys said his new DNA-identification technique,which will be commercialized by Imperial Chemical IndustriesPLC, eliminates much of the subjectivity involved in theprevious method, which called for scientists to measure andcompare the lengths of various DNA snippets.</LP><TEXT>   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the nucleus ofevery human cell and contains all the information needed tomake the proteins that are the basis of life. With theexception of identical twins, the composition of everyindividual's DNA is thought to be unique.   Since it was developed by Dr. Jeffreys in 1985, the oldermethod of DNA fingerprinting has generally been accepted as avalid way to establish identity in a variety of legalcircumstances, from murder cases to paternity disputes. ButDNA fingerprinting has also faced some legal attacks,focusing not on its scientific basis but on its reliabilityamid a lack of standards and quality control.   In a 1989 case in the U.S., for example, a judge excludedcertain genetic evidence because of flawed laboratorytechniques. Other challenges have centered on questionablestatistical claims, or on loose methods of comparing DNAsamples -- an issue that drew the attention of the U.S.Congress' Office of Technology Assessment, which last yearcalled for the establishment of firmer standards.   The new approach, detailed in this week's issue of Nature,a British scientific journal, appears to address many ofthese concerns. Rather than producing &quot;barcode&quot; pictures ofDNA fragments that must be compared side-by-side -- often bysimple eyeballing -- Dr. Jeffreys's new method automaticallygenerates from each sample of DNA a string of numbers,anywhere from 50 to 70 digits long, that is almost certainlydifferent for every unrelated individual in the world.   In addition to being easily and objectively compared,these numbers theoretically don't vary according to when orwhere genetic material is gathered, meaning that they caneasily be entered into computer databases for futurereference.   Under the previous method, two DNA samples could mostreliably be compared if they were prepared as part of thesame experiment, using the same materials. That meant thatdatabases of genetic fingerprints, difficult to encode ascomputer data in any case, were always a little suspect as abasis for comparison.   Additionally, the new identification method is quickerthan the previous fingerprinting technique -- two days,compared with four weeks or more -- and requires far lessgenetic material.   As with the previous technique, variations on the basicmethod are possible and should allow other DNA-fingerprintingfirms -- such as Lifecodes Corp. of Valhalla, N.Y. -- toadopt the process if they wish.   &quot;We're anxious and interested&quot; to see the Nature article,said Michael Baird, director of forensic science forLifecodes, which has provided genetic evidence in many U.S.court cases.</TEXT></DOC>
