<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-73-0499 </DOCNO><TEXT>In preparation for the PISC (Programme for the Inspection of Steel Components)II trials, the flat plate scanning technique was developed to emphasisethe capabilities of the time-of-flight method for three-dimensional locationand sizing of defects. In addition multi-probe arrays were developedfor time-of-flight inspection of the complex geometry of the PWR nozzle-to-vesselweld. This paper describes the methods used and illustrates the resultsobtained for the clad-side inspection of PISC II flat plate No. 2 andfor the inspection of Plate No. 3 (the PWR inlet nozzle assembly).</TEXT></DOC>
