International and one of its subsidiaries said they hold 5.14% of Capital Southwest Corp.'s common shares outstanding.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Houston-based Service Corp. and its Investment Capital Corp. unit said they hold 98,000 common shares, including 5,000 common shares bought Dec. 24 for $29.50 each. Service Corp. operates funeral homes, cemeteries, crematories and flower shops.    According to the filing, Service Corp. bought the stock of Capital Southwest, a Dallas-based venture capital concern, for investment purposes. However, Service Corp. said that it has talked with Capital Southwest about the possibility of exchanging its Capital Southwest stock for certain Capital Southwest assets. The filing didn't identify the assets.    Service Corp. also said in the filing that it doesn't currently intend to seek control of Capital Southwest, but it reserved the right to do so in the future based on its continuing evaluation of the company's financial condition and other factors.    Capital Southwest Corp. declined to comment on the filing.    In national over-the-counter trading, Capital Southwest closed yesterday at $32.25, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
