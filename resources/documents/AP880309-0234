The hemorrhage of jobs from the region was another point ofweakness in the 18 northern states stretching from Minnesota to NewEngland, the Northeast-Midwest Institute said in its study, ``TheState of the Region.''   ``The short-term economic outlook for the entire region ispositive,'' the report said. The region shared in the nationalreturn to prosperity from 1983 to late 1986, with New Englandbenefiting the most and the Midwest the least.   However, the study warned that the region's well-being isendangered by the failure of its population growth to keep pacewith the rest of the nation's.   ``The trend is expected to continue through the turn of thecentury,'' the study said. ``Government researchers expectpopulation in the Northeast and Midwest to grow at only 3.8 percentthroughout the 1990s, about half the national average.''   The Sunbelt states in the South and West will show populationincreases of 10 percent in the 1990s, the study said.   The lagging population gains in the Northeast and Midwest resultboth from lower birth rates and migration to southern and westernstates, the study said.   Slower population growth translates into less clout in Congress,with the region expected to lose 14 House seats after the 1990census. The region lost 15 seats after the 1980 census, for a totalprojected loss in representation of 13 percent in the 1970s and1980s, the study said.   ``Political influence, from the selection of the president inthe electoral college to appropriation fights in the House ofRepresentatives, will shift further to the South and West,'' thestudy said. ``Moreover, because billions of dollars are allocatedby formulas based on population, the Northeast-Midwest region canexpect reductions in its share of federal funding.''   Although unemployment dropped below the national average inparts of the region, it was unlikely to regain many of the 1.3million manufacturing jobs lost between 1980 and 1986, the studysaid.   The South and West for the first time topped the Northeast andMidwest in manufacturing employment in 1986. The Sunbelt had9,542,500 employees on manufacturing payrolls, compared with9,394,000 in the Northeast and Midwest.   Other points made by the study were:   _Per capita personal income increased faster in the Northeastand Midwest than in the South and West.   _The Northeast and Midwest invested more in public schooleducation than did other regions.   _The trend toward an older population was more evident in theNortheast and Midwest than in the rest of the country.   The study covered these states: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, RhodeIsland, Vermont and Wisconsin.   The privately funded Northeast-Midwest Institute was formed in1977 at the request of members of the House and Senate from theregion. The study was also sponsored by two legislative groups: theNortheast-Midwest Congressional Coalition and the Northeast-MidwestSenate Coalition.</TEXT></DOC>
