The assessment provides a basis for the conclusion that thefield testing of the genetically engineered tomato plants does not presenta risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination and also will not causeany significant impact to the quality of the human environment.

The rule regulates the introduction(importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) ofgenetically engineered organisms and products which are plant pests orwhich there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles).The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limited permitsfor the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. A permitmust be obtained before a regulated article can be introduced in the UnitedStates.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).E.I. Du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., Inc., of Wilmington, Delaware, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment of geneticallyengineered tomato plants that are designed to be tolerant to sulfonylureaherbicides. In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessedthe impact to the environment of releasing the tomato plants under theconditions described in the E.I. Du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., Inc., application.APHIS concluded that the field testing will not present a risk of plantpest introduction or dissemination and will also not cause any significantimpact on the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by E.I. Du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., Inc.,as well as a review of other relevant literature, provides the public withdocumentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impactsassociated with conducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene for herbicide tolerance has been inserted into a tomato chromosome.In nature, genetic material contained on chromosomes can only be transferredto other sexually compatible plants by cross-pollination. In this fieldtest, the introduced gene cannot spread to other plants by cross-pollination,because the field test plot is located at a sufficient distance from anysexually compatible plants with which the experimental tomato plants couldcross-polliante.2. Neither the herbicide tolerance gene itself, nor its gene product, conferson the tomato plants any plant pest characteristcs. Traits such as weedinessare polygenic and cannot be conferred to a nontransformed plant by addinga single herbicide tolerance gene. These experimental tomato plants remainsensitive to a wide range of other herbicides which could be used to killthese plants.3. The tobacco cultivar from which the herbicide tolerance gene was obtainedis not a plant pest.4. The herbicide tolerance gene does not provide the transformed tomatoplants with any measurable selective advantage over nontransformed tomatoplants in their ability to be disseminated or to become established inthe environment.5. The vector used to transfer the herbicide tolerance gene to tomato plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom a DNA sequence with known plant pathogenic potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for virulence have been removed fromthe vector. The vector has been tested and shown not to be pathogenic toplants.6. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver the vectorDNA and the herbicide tolerance gene into the tomato cells, has been shownto be killed and no longer associated with the regenerated transformedtomato plants.7. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering and inserting the gene into the tomato genome (i.e.,chromosomal DNA). The vector does not survive in the plants.8. Sulfonylurea herbicides are a new class of herbicides noted for theirhigh herbicidal activity at very low use rates, excellent crop selectivity,and low mammalian toxicity.9. The size of the enclosed field test trial plot is small (25 feet wideby 30 feet long). The plot has good physical security. Physical isolationwill be ensured and incursion by large animals and humans will be preventedby a chain-linked fence. In addition, security guards are on site permanently.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA regulations implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS guidelines implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 9th day of February, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
