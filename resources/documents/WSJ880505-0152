The company predicted &quot;much improved&quot; net for 1988.    Net of the aerospace concern was $21 million, or 61 cents a share, 8% below the year-earlier operating profit of $22.9 million, or 66 cents a share. A year earlier, a gain of $35 million, or $1.07 a share, from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes made net $57.9 million, or $1.73 a share.    Sales rose 6.5% to $908 million from $852.2 million. The company said its backlog at March 31 remained at the record year-end level of $7.9 billion, up from $7.2 billion at the end of last year's first quarter.    President John O'Brien said net &quot;will be much improved&quot; this year despite the first-quarter decline.    For 1987, operating earnings were $650,000, an amount insufficient to cover preferred dividends. That figure, however, included earnings from continuing operations of $27.1 million, or 67 cents a share, despite a $36.6 million charge related to a settlement with the Navy.    The profit from continuing operations was largely offset by a $26.4 million loss from discontinued operations, related to an out-of-court settlement of a dispute involving buses sold to New York City.    After the $35 million effect of the accounting change, 1987 net was $35.7 million, or 94 cents a share. Sales were $3.38 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
