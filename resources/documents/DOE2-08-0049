The blood flow through thehepatic artery, as measured with the radioactive microsphere method,was 0.21 ml/min/gm; it increased by 13% and 16% when heated for 15 minutesat 41{sup 0}C and 43{sup 0}C, respectively. The portal vein blood flowwas 1.09 ml/min/gm and decreased by 12% and 20% on heating for 15 minutesat 41{sup 0}C and 43{sup 0}C, respectively. The total liver blood flow,therefore, decreased by 11% at 41{sup 0}C and by 14% at 43{sup 0}C fromthe control value of 1.30 ml/min/gm.</TEXT></DOC>
