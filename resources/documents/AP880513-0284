The Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources, reportedFriday that International Lease Finance Corp. is expected toannounce Monday that Boeing has won 80 percent of the order for upto 120 planes, and that the European consortium Airbus Industriewill get the rest.   ILFC Vice President Kenneth Taylor said in a telephone interviewtoday that he knew news of a decision had leaked out, but he saidno formal announcement would be made by the company until Mondaymorning.   He said company President Steven Udvar-Hazy was in Seattle topick up a previously ordered 747 at Boeing's Everett plant _ thecompany's fourth.   ILFC, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., recently announced itintended to buy as many as 120 planes, including options, in acombination of medium- and long-range aircraft. The company's boardreportedly met Tuesday to decide which companies would get theorder.   Tom Cole, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle,said the company didn't have details of the order yet and wouldn'tsay anything until International does. David Venz, Airbus U.S.spokesman in Herndon, Va., said the same thing.   But Judith Comeau of Goldman, Sachs in New York said Friday thatsuppliers had received the orders already.   ``I don't know why they're waiting so long'' to announce it, shesaid of International Lease.   Ms. Comeau said she was quite sure four companies would get apiece of the action _ Boeing and Airbus for the aircraft, andGeneral Electric and Pratt andamp; Whitney for engines _ and that shewouldn't be surprised if Boeing got most of it.   ``According to International Lease Finance, they wanted a fullrange of aircraft, including the 747,'' she said. ``No otheraircraft can take that many passengers. In terms of volume, Boeingobviously has the largest capacity and would be in a betterposition to bid this contract.   ``Also, International Finance Corp. leases its aircraft toairlines, and it's easier to maintain aircraft with somecommonality. Boeing already has a large share of the market.''   George Shapiro of Salomon Bros. in New York agreed.   ``I've kind of expected Boeing would be the winner,'' he said.``If you're leasing airplanes to airliners ... you're best offusing the most known and most familiar. Boeing has a dominantmarket share.''   A spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. told theWall Street Journal that the company never seriously considereditself a candidate for the order.   The planes would meet ILFC's fleet needs between 1991 and 1995,Udvar-Hazy has said. The company's biggest previous order was lastyear's 19-plane purchase of several Boeing models worth $1.15billion.   Udvar-Hazy earlier indicated the coming order would be forall-Boeing aircraft or a combination of Airbus or McDonnell Douglasaircraft. But he said Thursday that the order had been changed tomix sources.   The largest aircraft order to date is thought to be BritishAirways' $2.3 billion purchase of 16 Boeing 747s in 1986, whichwould have a value of $4.1 billion if 12 options for other jumbojets are exercised.</TEXT></DOC>
