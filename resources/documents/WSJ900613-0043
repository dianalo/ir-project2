KKR, which quietly raised the money from investors in its$5.6 billion leveraged buy-out fund this week, hopes that thecash infusion, together with other financial restructuringmoves, will cause $6 billion of RJR Nabisco junk bonds torise above their current depressed trading levels. In raisingthe $1.7 billion, KKR was drawing upon previous commitmentsby its investors to the $5.6 billion fund.</LP><TEXT>   If the RJR Nabisco junk bonds rally, that will make iteasier for KKR to fulfill a requirement that it reset theinterest rate on the bonds to make them trade at their facevalue, or par, no later than next April.   Bonds of the largest RJR issue in question, which tradedat prices below 60 cents on the dollar earlier this year,rallied late yesterday to close at 69.375 cents on thedollar.   The main result of the new cash infusion is likely to belower overall returns for investors in KKR's leveragedbuy-out fund. But if the financial restructuring of RJR issuccessful, it will allow RJR to avoid paying extremely highinterest rates on the reset bonds in the future.   Though RJR's basic businesses recently have performedwell, the company's junk bonds have been depressed by concernabout the company's heavy debt load and general weakness inthe junk bond market.   Spokesmen for RJR Nabisco and KKR declined to comment onthe planned equity infusion.   KKR took the food and tobacco giant private last year in arecord $25 billion leveraged buy-out.   KKR hasn't yet completed all the details of the financialrestructuring moves it will take to deal with the reset bondproblem, according to people familiar with KKR. However, themoves are likely to include new bank loans, if attractiveterms can be arranged, and may include an offer to buy backthe reset bonds from holders or to exchange them for newlyissued bonds, these people said.   People familiar with the RJR transaction said thatinvestors in KKR's $5.6 billion leveraged buy-out fund eachwere asked to deliver their share of the new $1.7 billioncash infusion by last Monday. In addition to the new moneyfrom the outside investors, KKR itself may also invest asmall amount of additional money.   KKR's fund originally invested $1.5 billion to helpfinance the RJR buy-out. While a new equity investment wouldmore than double the amount of the original investment,several people familiar with the transaction said that RJR'sfinancial performance had proved so strong since the buy-outthat KKR's institutional investors still expected to obtain areturn of 20% to 30% a year on their investment in RJR.   Such returns would rank the RJR buy-out as significantlyless successful than many of KKR's earlier and much smallerbuy-outs, which once generated annual returns of nearly 80% ayear. For the moment, however, KKR's investors seem pleasedwith RJR's prospects.   &quot;All their major investors are very happy,&quot; said oneperson involved in the RJR fund-raising. &quot;They are going tobe earning up to 30% on absolutely huge amounts of money,&quot; hesaid of the big investors.   The investors in KKR's LBO fund include insurancecompanies, pension funds, endowments and other largeinstitutions. As limited partners in the LBO fund, thesepartners have no control over the investment decisions takenby KKR.   Nevertheless, KKR takes pains to keep its partnersinformed on its investments. In May, for example, KKR'sinvestors were invited to a portfolio review meeting in SanFrancisco at which KKR partners painted a glowing picture ofRJR's cash flow and other financial barometers.   KKR further smoothed the way for adding new equity to theRJR deal last week by selling Beatrice Cos. to ConAgra for$1.34 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption ofBeatrice debt. The sale price was less than originally hoped,but still provided KKR investors returns of about 50% a yearwhile KKR owned Beatrice.   The RJR recapitalization is expected to involve severalphases; the structure and timing of each step will depend inlarge measure on the market reception given to the resetbonds after the previous step.   &quot;There is going to be a plan for everything, but it isevolving,&quot; said one person familiar with KKR's preparationsto deal with the RJR reset notes.   KKR has some flexibility in deciding how to deal with thereset problem. Although the deadline for determining a resetrate is next April, KKR can reset the interest rate at anytime before that. The exact rate must be agreed upon byinvestment bankers representing KKR and by Lazard Freres andamp;Co. and Dillon Read andamp; Co., which were the investment bankingfirms representing the former publicly traded RJR Nabisco.   Although the firms must agree that the new interest rateon the bonds would cause the bonds to trade at their fullface amount, there isn't any requirement that the bondsactually trade at that price.   If the RJR bonds don't rally, KKR could be forced to resetinterest rates at 20% or more. While those rates wouldn'tnecessarily cripple RJR, it would severely depress theprofits for KKR and its investors, and would send adisturbing message to the junk bond market, which has viewedRJR Nabisco as one of its strongest credits.</TEXT></DOC>
