Sunshine Natural Gas System wants to construct and operate a 608-mile pipeline -- the longest in the gulf -- extending from the huge Mobile Bay gas field in Alabama to the west coast of Florida and inland to Manatee and Martin counties.    If the pipeline is constructed, Sunshine would invade markets held solely by Florida Gas Transmission Co., a unit of Enron Corp., analysts said. &quot;They are up against a strong and entrenched competitor,&quot; said John E. Olson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;I would think they would have to see something in the way of contracts -- the color of money -- before this could get off the ground.&quot;    A Coastal spokesman said the pipeline could capitalize on the population growth in the state. &quot;The potential for growth in Florida is tremendous,&quot; he said, &quot;particularly in the central and west part of Florida.&quot; He declined to say whether utilities or industry in Florida had expressed interest in purchasing natural gas from Sunshine.    A spokesman for Florida Power Corp., a unit of St. Petersburg-based Florida Progress Corp. and the state's second-largest electrical utility, said the company has agreed to contribute $55,000 toward a $750,000 environmental study for the pipeline, but has made no other commitment. &quot;We are a possible customer,&quot; the spokesman said.    Regulatory approvals could take as long as a year or more, and the construction would be finished, if all goes according to plan, by 1991. Under new federal rules, the pipeline would be &quot;open access,&quot; meaning it would provide gas transportation to all customers, even if they purchased their gas from a source other than Coastal. Because the Mobile Bay field is connected to others around North America, the pipeline could draw on supplies from almost anywhere in the U.S. and Canada, Coastal said.    Sunshine is a general partnership of ANR Southern Pipeline Co. and ANR Gulf Pipeline Co., both units of Coastal. </TEXT></DOC>
