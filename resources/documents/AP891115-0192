With the president's endorsement, Democratic and RepublicanHouse leaders formally unveiled their plan and said they expect itwill pass easily in a vote Thursday. The Senate is expected to voteon pay before Thanksgiving, maybe with a different level for itself.   The House package would, depending on inflation, raise itssalaries by at least 35 percent and more likely 39 percent, from$89,500 to an estimated $124,400, in just over 13 months. It couldbe more.   Bush, in a letter to the speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley,said:   ``Issues such as the ban on congressional honoraria, limits ongifts and travel, increased financial disclosure, restrictions onoutside income, conflict of interest rules and many other importantreforms have been addressed.   ``In my view, the bill would effect a tremendous change in thelandscape of government ethics standards.''   Under the House plan, raises would be given to top officialsgovernment-wide, except for the Senate, which was considering aseparate ethics and pay package for itself.   The House package implements the pay raise in two stages. OnJan. 1, members and the very highest paid officials, such asfederal judges and top Executive Branch officials, would get a 7.9percent increase as a ``cost-of-living'' adjustment to make up forthe two years in which they did not receive raises.   In 1991, another cost-of-living raise would take effect formembers, and the top-most officials. Under that adjustment, whichwould be based on changes in the government's consumer pricecalculations, members and high officials would get the sameadjustment normally passed on to all federal workers.   The $124,400 ultimate pay figure is based on an adjustment ofabout 3 percent.   Also on Jan. 1, 1991, an additional 25 percent raise would beput in place to accompany implementation of the heart of the ethicspackage _ a ban on lawmakers padding their income with speechhonoraria and stricter limits on other outside income.   The inclusion of a cost-of-living increase in 1991 in additionto the 25 percent raise was disclosed by lawmakers for the firsttime on Wednesday.   Currently, House members are allowed to keep honoraria up to 30percent of their income, senators up to 40 percent. The new ruleswould ban House members from accepting honoraria and limit otheroutside earned income to 15 percent of salary.   A House member would still be able to give a speech and have thehost donate the money that would be paid to the member to alegitimate charity. The destination of the payment would be keptsecret by the House ethics committee.   If Congress later votes to kill the 25 percent pay raise, theethics rules changes on outside income would automatically berescinded. Cost-of-living raises would continue automatically after1991, but based on a government index of salary raises in theprivate sector.   Other ethics changes in the bill include:   _Ending in 1993 the rule whereby House members elected before1980 can pocket their campaign treasuries when they retire fromCongress. Some members currently have more than $1 million stashedaway.   _Increased detail of disclosure of personal wealth.   Currently, the top category is ``$250,000 and above.'' The newforms would have categories for ``$250,000 to $500,000'' and``greater than $1 million.'' Members who have blind trusts fortheir assets would have to report the size of the trust, inaddition to the current requirement of reporting the income.   _Revised procedures for the House Ethics Committee, includingexpanding the panel so that some members could investigate andothers judge the results. Currently, the whole panel does both.   The committee would also set up a separate office to educate andadvise lawmakers on ethics rules.   _Tighten rules for accepting free travel and gifts from peopleother than immediate family.   Several of the ethics changes were in response to the case offormer Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Wright resigned last Junerather than face charges that he accepted improper gifts and evadedlimits on honoraria.   A 51 percent congressional pay raise, with no attached ethicspackage, was rejected earlier this year when Wright was stillspeaker.   White House endorsement of the ethics package was delayed thisweek because C. Boyden Gray, the president's counsel, was notsatisfied with conflict-of-interest rules as they applied tocongressional staff.   The differences were resolved early Wednesday in a meetingbetween House Republican leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and WhiteHouse Chief of Staff John Sununu.   In the Senate, Majority Leader George Mitchell has said heenvisions a more modest pay package for senators, perhaps providingonly the cost-of-living adjustments and a more gradual eliminationof speech honoraria.   On Wednesday, Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Warren Rudman,R-N.H., introduced a bill based on the work of their ethics taskforce that includes restrictions not found in the House package.   The Senate plan would tighten ``revolving door'' rules so that,for the first time, former members of Congress and top stafferswould be not be able to return to Capitol Hill to lobby for oneyear. Similar restrictions already exist for the executive branch.   Like the House package, Senate rules for accepting travel andgifts would be tightened, and personal financial disclosure wouldbe increased.</TEXT></DOC>
