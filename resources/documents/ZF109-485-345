(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Although desktop publishing has revolutionized the way we generatenewsletters, brochures, and corporate reports, the software used by the DTPindustry presents some problems when it comes to long documents such as booksor technical manuals.andM;Interleaf made a sporting, but abortive, attempt at porting its workstationprogram, Interleaf Publisher, to the Macintosh two years ago (see &quot;A New Leafon Life,&quot; May  88, page 158).andP;  The program's interface and outrageous fontmismanagement, however, doomed it from the start.andM;Frame Technology apparently learned from Interleaf's bitter experience anddid almost everything right when it ported FrameMaker, also aworkstationprogram, to the Macintosh.andP;  For the production of long ortechnical documentation, it has no equal in the Mac arena.andM;Frame Building.andP;  Installing FrameMaker involves simply dragging files fromthe eight distribution disks to a hard-disk drive.andP;  Unfortunately, FrameTechnology didn't set the application's bundle bit on any copies of themaster disks I've seen.andP;  That means, contrary to what the manual says, thatyou cannot simply double-click on a FrameMaker document from the Finder andexpect it to open.andP;  You have to use a program such as ResEdit, DiskTop, orNorton Utilities to set the bundle bit.andP;  It's hard to believe that thiswasn't caught before the product shipped, but Frame said the problem had beenfixed as we went to press.andM;For optimal use, the $995 program needs an SE/30 or Mac 11 equipped with a40-megabyte hard-disk drive, 4 megabytes of RAM, a PostScript printer, alarge-screen monitor (preferably a two-page display), and System 6.0.2 orlater.andP;  It can function as a hard-core word processor (albeit an expensiveone) on a Mac Plus with 2 megabytes of RAM and a hard-disk drive.andP;  Theprogram fully supports ATM and MultiFinder.andM;FrameMaker, like QuarkXPress, DesignStudio, and many others, uses text orgraphic frames as its basic building blocks.andP;  (There is no pasteboard,however, making FrameMaker less than ideal for design-intensive projects suchas newsletters.) Creating a new document involves steps that are familiar tousers of major DTP applications.andP;  You establish the number of pages (limitedonly by disk size), create up to 25 master pages, and create paragraph andcharacter formats, Landscape and portrait pages can be mixed within the samedocument (useful for foldouts).andP;  You can also construct reference pages forstoring frequently used graphics or text blocks so that material such aslogos, rules, or boilerplate text is placed only once in a document.andO;FrameMaker also supports registration and crop marks during printing and canoutput spot-color separations.andP;  From this point on, however, FrameMakerbegins to distinguish itself from other DTP programs with some sophisticated,powerful features - many of them unique in the Mac world.andM;Characters with Style.andP;  FrameMaker provides extensive power for creatingparagraph formats (usually called styles in other programs).andP;  The ParagraphFormat dialog box contains controls over tabs; fonts (a built-in fontharmonizer similar to Adobe Type Reunion makes selecting weights and styles apleasure); pair kerning; auto-numbering; the option of forcing one style toalways follow another style; widows and orphans; hyphenation; the option ofexempting a paragraph from spell-checking (this feature lets you specify thata block of programming code, for example, should not be spell-checked); andthe automatic placement of bullets, graphics from reference pages, andanchored rules.andP;  This dialog box, like most dialog boxes in FrameMaker, isnot modal.andP;  In other words, it can remain open while you are working in thedocument.andP;  FrameMaker also supports character-level formats that can be savedin style catalogs in much the same fashion as paragraph formats.andP;  Both theparagraph and character catalogs are easily accessible from floatingpalettes.andM;The program's 130,000-word spelling checker  (augmentable with document/template-specific or user dictionaries) works well and quickly.andP;  It canautomatically delete extra spaces and search for unusual capitalization orhyphenation.andP;  You can instruct it to ignore words in all caps, words withdigits, or words containing specific symbols or characters.andM;The program can also prevent you from typing two spaces at the end of asentence.andP;  You can apply smart quotes and indicate where FrameMaker can breaklines without hyphenating a text string (a wonderful feature for documentsthat include things such as DOS pathnames).andP;  FrameMaker also has powerfulGREP-like find/change capabilities and can search for paragraph and characterformats, special characters and markers, cross-references, frames, and so on.andM;FrameMaker supports PostScript pass-throughs, much as Word 4.0 does, so youcan include PostScript routines for generating special text effects.andM;FrameMaker includes text-import filters only for MacWrite 5.0 (not MacWrite11), Word 3.0 or 4.0, and ASCII, but the program's extensive text-editingfeatures might well make composing in an external word processor unnecessary.andM;The major shortcoming in the text department is the absence of a tableeditor.andP;  The package contains a booklet that shows how to create tables -clumsily - in FrameMaker, but it primarily draws attention to thissignificant failing.andM;Advanced Framework.andP;  Features such as cross-referencing, automatic TOC (tableof contents) generation and indexing, variables  equivalent to glossary itemsin other programs), book building (linking separate documents into one withfull support for cross-references, footnotes, TOCs, and indexes across allparts of the &quot;book&quot;), and change bars make appearances in other programs, butFrameMaker's implementation surpasses the competition.andP;  And Frame has packedsome other suprisingly powerful features into FrameMaker--such as MIF (MakerInterchange Format), MML (Maker Markup Language), hypertext, and FrameMath.andM;MIF is a format that saves FrameMaker documents for use on other platformsrunning FrameMaker  see the &quot;Frame to Frame&quot; sidebar for details onnetworking FrameMaker on different platforms).andP;  You can also use MIF tocreate custom import or output filters.andM;MML is a markup language that lets you use any standard text editor toprovide basic format information on items such as page size, paragraph-formatnames, anchored frames, and the like.andP;  Text files tagged in this way can beopened as formatted documents from within a FrameMaker template.andM;FrameMaker's hypertext feature makes it possible to attach hypertext files todocuments.andP;  A publishing work group, for example, can create a hypertextexplanation of the in-house style, standardized abbreviations, orinstructions on how to use a specific template and make this explanationaccessible from a particular document.andP;  You can create buttons and pop-upmenus to aid in navigation via a HyperTalk-like programming language.andM;But the jewel in the crown is FrameMath, an integrated module that lets youtypeset complex display or in-line mathematical equations by using a cleverfloating palette without resorting to tedious code entry (as in Word).andP;  Andthe program not only sets the equations you key in but can solve them aswell.andP;  If you've forgotten how to add fractions, FrameMaker can do it foryou.andP;  Equations, once set, remain fully editable.andM;CALS/SGML support, fast becoming a requirement for anyone dealing withfederal agencies, is also promised for a future release.andM;Graphic Images.andP;  FrameMaker imports the usual variety of Mac graphics formats- TIFF (color or gray scale), PICT, EPS, and MacPaint - into anchored orunanchored frames.andP;  You can also import EPSI (an encapsulated PostScriptformat used in the UNIX world), DOS EPS, and Sun raster files.andP;  You can bringgraphics in by reference (thus cutting down on file size) or actually copythem into the FrameMaker document.andP;  Scaling and cropping are fully supported.andM;Within the program, you can also create graphics, includingrectangles/squares, ovals/circles, polygons, arrows, and Bezier curves.andP;  Youcan manipulate the latter by manipulating control points.andP;  Graphic objectscan be scaled, cropped, rotated (in 90-degree increments), inverted, andgrouped.andP;  There are 16 fill patterns.andP;  A serious shortcoming is that fillsare not, and cannot be, specified by percentages.andP;  You simply have to acceptwhat Frame supplies.andM;The Bottom Line.andP;  There are some things I wish FrameMaker did better.andP;  Theprogram's window handling is sometimes quite annoying, especially duringspell-checking.andP;  The spelling-checker window frequently hides the word inquestion.andP;  Maybe this is why Frame recommends a full-page monitor, but evenwith a two-page display I found myself playing touch tag with thespelling-checker window far too often.andM;There are no draggable ruler guides tools that most desktop publishers findindispensable.andP;  It would be great if you could set certain tool palettes orthe format catalogs to open with a document, but you can't.andP;  FrameMakerdoesn't make tables gracefully - an amazing oversight in a program that inmost respects is the ideal platform for producing technical documentation.andM;Aside from these omissions, I strongly recommend FrameMaker.andP;  It's one of thefinest pieces of Mac software I've seen in the last two years.andP;  It's nearlyin the same league as Adobe's Photoshop (and Adobe might agree, because ituses FrameMaker for its documentation).andP;  Its indisputable prowess incross-referencing, tremendous support for long-document processing, andnumerous other bells and whistles make it a winner.andM;- Grogery WassonandM;FrameMaker ****1/2andM;Published by: Frame Technology,andM;1010 Rincon Circle, San Jose, CAandM;95131; (408) 433-331 1.andM;Version: 2.1.andM;List Price: $995.andM;Frame to FrameandM;Because Frame Technology first baptized Frame Maker in the UNIX waters of SunMicrosystems and NEXT, it may not be unusual for Mac users, at least inlarger companies, to have to network their Macs with UNIX platforms andtransfer FrameMaker documents between them.andP;  Frame promises considerableprogram compatibility across platforms.andP;  MacUser Labs NetWorkShop took a lookto determine what limitations and problems a networked configuration mightinvolve.andM;We networked a Mac IIci (4 megabytes of RAM), a NeXT computer (8 megabytes ofRAM), and the new Sun SPARCstation IPC (24 megabytes of RAM, running underSunView), using Ethernet.andP;  File transfers were made with TCP/Connect II, animplementation of FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for the Mac.andM;The Mac and NEXT versions of FrameMaker each cost $995, and the Sun versionis pricey at$2,500.andP;  Frame markets both SunView and X Window versions for theSun systems.andP;  Aversion for IBM RISC 6000 workstations is planned, but norelease date has been announced, and it will involve hardware ranging inprice from $13,000to $74,000.andM;There is little difference in functionality in any of the packages.andP;  TheSun/NeXT software has a built-in macro capability that's lacking inFrameMaker for the Mac (QuicKeys or Tempo II can be used instead).andP;  The NEXTincarnation has a unique look, of course (see figure), but the basics andmost of the features are identical across platforms.andM;Networking machines can involve frustrating complexities of cables andhardware--it took repeated visits from Sun representatives before ourrelatively simple network function proprerly.andP;  Once it was working, wecreated documents on each of the platforms and transferred them around on thenetwork in a game of computerized musical chairs.andP;  Here are some of ourconclusions:andM;Graphics posed the greatest difficulties by far.andP;  Mac PICT and MacPaint fileshad to be saved within a Mac FrameMaker file by use of the FrameImagefeature.andP;  This command allows these Mac formats to be displayed on the UNIXplatforms, but it also enlarges the size of the graphics by as much as 1 00percent.andP;  Mac EPS files displayed normally on the NEXT machine but had to beconverted for use as EPSI files on the Sun machines via Frame EPSF Converter(a utility available by request from Frame Technology) -at least forimporting them by reference rather than by copying into the Sun file.andP;  In thelatter situation, you must save EPS files on the Mac side with FrameImage.andO;If you don't, the EPS image will print normally but appear as a gray box inthe document.andM;You must also save Mac TIFF files with the FrameImage feature for display onthe UNIX platforms.andP;  The obvious drawback is, in short, that although MacTIFF and PICT images could be viewed on UNIX machines with a bit of muckingaround, they printed from those machines as 72-dpi bit maps.andP;  Spot-color orcolor images placed in Mac documents did not display as color on the othertwo platforms, but such documents could be imported to the UNIX machines,modified, and then brought back to the Mac without any loss of colorinformation.andP;  Sounds scary, but it works.andM;EPS graphics created in the NeXT environment did not preview on the Mac andSun machines, but they did print.andP;  NEXT TIFF files transferred to the Macwithout any noticeable problems.andP;  NEXT snd files could be used in FrameMakerdocuments, but they didn't transfer to the other platforms.andM;Sun raster files, graphics created with popular Sun programs such as TopDrawIsland Paint or Island Draw, all transferred perfectly to the Mac and NEXTmachines.andM;Text transfers were less problematic, but some anomalies appeared intransfers f rom the Mac to the NEXT, with characters occasionally beingchanged into Times Roman from another font.andP;  FrameMath equations alwaystransferred correctly from one platform to another.andM;in short, FrameMaker lets you successfully hook your Mac into a UNIXenvironment, but you shouldn't expect absolute and transparent seamlessness.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
