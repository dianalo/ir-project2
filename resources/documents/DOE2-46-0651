The mean particle diameter (average of eight coals) falls from178 to 20 microns in four minutes. In the same period the average fractiongreater than 325 mesh (45 microns) falls from 67% to 3%. Energy requirementsare less than 30 kwh/US ton. For individual coals the ease of comminutionand the energy requirements for slurry attrition correlate weakly withHardgrove Grindability Index. An extended HGI is shown to have betterpredictive power. Extended attritor milling (for periods of 15 minutesto several hours) results in moderate incremental size reduction, butcoal density is increased and bitumen is expressed, indicating the substantialcollapse of partially filled macroporous structures. This leads to anomalouseffects with regard to visual appearance, ease of drying, and apparentviscosities of slurries. Micropore structure as evidenced by B-E-T measurementsis increased by extended milling. Coal which has been ``micronized''has been stored for 12 months under various conditions. At ambient temperatureand vented to air, micronized coal is oxidized more extensively than{minus}60 mesh coal. Micronized coal stored at subambient temperature,and/or stored in sealed containers with 0.1% hydroquinone present, undergoesrelatively little oxidative degradation. Results of several sets of experimentsexploring physical and chemical beneficiation are reported. Combinationsof float/sink and light attritor milling permit the separation of morethan 90% of the original mineral matter. 47 refs., 56 figs., 48 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
