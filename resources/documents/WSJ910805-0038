The agreement will reduce competition between the Sabresystem, which is owned by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit,and Amadeus, whose main shareholders are Lufthansa, AirFrance and Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana S.A.</LP><TEXT>   However, the pact will open up the home markets of Amadeus-- France, Germany and Spain -- to more competition fromother reservation systems, the commission said.   The EC's executive body had been concerned that the jointventure might distort-competition in home markets, butaccepted assurances from the companies involved that theywon't discriminate against other systems.   The airlines with shares in Amadeus and Sabre have agreednot to discriminate against other reservation systems by, forexample, refusing to allow their flights to be displayed onother systems   Under the agreement, Sabre will get access to EC marketsand Amadeus will benefit from new technologies, a commissionspokesman said.   The system will be marketed and distributed as a jointproduct in the EC. In France, Germany and Spain, it will beoperated by the national system, to which Sabre will transferall its assets. In the rest of Europe, the national marketingcompanies will be jointly owned by the two concerns andmanaged by Sabre.   The commission is seeking similar assurances ofnondiscrimination from Worldspan and Galileo, two othercomputer reservation systems operating in the EC, thestatement said.</TEXT></DOC>
