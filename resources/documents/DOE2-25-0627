The Ministry of Agriculture, in particular, claims that thenational forested area is actually increasing rapidly. A survey of humidtropical forests in Jamaica, carried out by the author in 1986, indicatesa 3.3 percent per annum rate of deforestation for 1980-1986. But, despitesignificant commercial lumber production, large clear fellings are rareand most modification of the forest is due to expansion of small-scalefarming (including Cannabis sativa) and pastoral activity. The size ofarea cleared is most often 20 to 25 hectares. As uncontrolled deforestationis adversely affecting watersheds and inducing serious flooding someform of control and management is urgently required.</TEXT></DOC>
