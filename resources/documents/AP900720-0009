ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of the world's endangered plants,from tiny Indonesian orchids to the giant saguaro cactus ofArizona, have found a home in a cluster of government-rungreenhouses where they are nursed back from the brink of extinction.   ``We keep the Noah's Ark of the plant world,'' said RobPennington, superintendent of collections at the U.S. BotanicGarden's 20-acre Poplar Point Nursery in southeast Washington.   Among the 25,000 plants that flourish in the nursery's two dozengreenhouses on the Anacostia River banks are about 3,000 rare andexotic specimens seized by customs officials at U.S. ports of entry.   The plants were removed from import shipments that violated theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species, amultinational accord that forbids trafficking in a long list ofendangered plants and animals without strict certification.   Diseased plants are destroyed immediately. The others are sentto 15 government ``plant rescue stations'' around the country,including Poplar Point, where they are nurtured and bred forscientific study and display at botanical gardens.   The Botanic Garden, established by Congress in 1821, also growsplants at Poplar Point to landscape the Capitol and adjacentfederal buildings and for seasonal floral displays at itsconservatory, a formal greenhouse on the Mall at the foot ofCapitol Hill.   There are no man-eating plants in Pennington's collections, butthere are extremely rare specimens of Encephalaratos lehmanniicyads from the desert region of Africa. These primitive, palm-likeplants survived the dinosaur era because of their toxic trunk androots. For centuries, they have poisoned human beings who beat thepulp into bread flour.   Poplar Point also acquired hundreds of Javanicum Tortipelatum, asmall, endangered orchid from Indonesia, from a grower's shipmentthat was confiscated in Los Angeles. They had spent six weeks inboxes without light or water. Pennington said it's a miracle thatmany managed to survive.   Domestically, the greenhouse is the last refuge of a ``sneezeweed'' that the state of Virginia spent 30 years trying toeradicate. Also here is the insect-gobbling Saracenia Oreophilaplant, now nearly extinct in its natural habitat along the Carolinaand Gulf Coast shores.   Poplar Point also is salvaging a majestic saguaro cactus ofArizona, once commonplace as a travel poster symbol of the aridSouthwest until it was nearly bulldozed into oblivion by landdevelopers.   Pennington delights visiting school children with tales abouthis Pittosporum boninensis, a nondescript shrub that's nearlyextinct on its native island of Chichi Jima in the Pacific Ocean. Acannibal supposedly lived there at one time.   Chichi Jima became a footnote in the history books when GeorgeBush, a young Navy pilot who later became president, ditched hiscrippled plane a few miles offshore after a bombing run againstJapanese forces in World War II.   ``I tell the kids that the cannibal used to hide in thisshrubbery waiting to eat downed pilots, and that George Bushescaped with his life,'' Pennington said with a laugh. ``When youhave a plant this plain and ugly, you have to think of something totell them.''   Pennington, 36, a horticulturist trained in plant pathology,said the biggest threat to the world's tropical plants comes fromrunaway population growth. More and more people means destructionof forests and vast amounts of foliage for food, housing andcommercial development.   ``These plants are endangered because they no longer have a homewhen their environment is removed,'' he said. ``We provide a homefor wayward plants, you might say.''</TEXT></DOC>
