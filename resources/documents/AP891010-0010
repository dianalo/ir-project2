AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The army major who led theunsuccessful coup against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was buriedMonday and opposition leader Guillermo Endara ended a 19-day hungerstrike.   Several reports have said an enraged Noriega personally shotMaj. Moises Giroldi, 38, to death minutes after the coup attemptagainst the Panamanian leader ended a week ago.   Relatives of Giroldi said he was shot once in the neck and twicein the chest. His mother, Eloisa, cried ``They murdered him!'' andflung herself on the coffin.   The major led an uprising Oct. 3 and captured Noriega, whocommands the Panamanian military and controls the government, butgave up when loyalists counterattacked while U.S. troops looked onfrom a few hundred yards away.   Officials of the Panamanian Defense Forces said eight officersand two sergeants were killed. They have not explained thecircumstances or responded to reports that some were slain aftersurrendering.   Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo on Mondaysaid Noriega met with his general staff to begin reshufflingmilitary units that hesitated during the uprising or openly opposedhim.   The spokesman also said U.S. helicopters tried to interceptforces loyal to Noriega flying into Panama City from Rio Hato, butwavered, apparently because they had not been given specific orders.   ``They tried to dissuade the Machos de Monte (the company thatnow guards Defense Forces headquarters) but there was no decisionto say `you cannot pass,''' he said.Lopez Grimaldo did not describewhat action the helicopters took.   In another development, the civilian Cabinet met with PresidentFrancisco Rodriguez to approve emergency laws first proposed byNoriega last week and aimed at stifling military and politicaldissent.   They include a military code, reforms to the penal code, laborlaws to make it easier to fire disloyal public employees andeconomic laws to encourage investment.   Endara meanwhile ended his fast and entered a clinic to``normalize my body's system.''   A medical bulletin said his ``conscious process was excellentand his conversationcoherent,'' but he was suffering ``fromprogressive debilitation.''   The opposition leader has urged Panamanians to delay payingtaxes and utility bills, and to shun the government lottery andcasinos, on which the government has depended for much of itsrevenue the past 18 months.   The United States has applied economic sanctions against Panamasince federal grand juries in Florida indicted Noriega in February1988 on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.   Noriega claims all efforts to oust him are part of a U.S. plotto retain control of the Panama Canal after 1999, when it is to beturned over under treaties signed in 1977.   At a news conference, Endara said he felt his hunger strike wasa success. He said the opposition did not approve of the coupbecause it represented ``Noriegaism without Noriega,'' not amovement toward democracy.   Capt. Leon Tejada, another rebel, was buried at the same smallred stone church over the weekend. ``He had one bullet wound in theright temple,'' said Tejada's mother, Esther, who was at the churchagain for Giroldi's burial.   About 100 people attended the funeral Mass for Giroldi.   ``They were good friends,'' Mrs. Tejada said. ``My son had justcome back from (U.N. duty in) Namibia last Saturday. On Tuesday hetold his wife he had to go to headquarters and would return laterto go see his baby girl.   ``We did not hear anything until Wednesday when they said ontelevision that he was dead. We picked up the body.''   Giroldi's widow and three children did not attend. They havebeen under U.S. Army protection at Fort Clayton since the coup.   The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the United States hasflown about 40 Panama coup participants, family members or Noriegaopponents to Miami, including Mrs. Giroldi, her two sons, herfather and other family members.   The group included 14 military personnel, according to thepaper, which quoted unidentified Bush administration sources.   Defense Forces officials say the rebels surrendered after nearlyfive hours of negotiations with Noriega, who was their hostage atDefense Forces headquarters.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several U.S. newspapers have saidNoriega personally shot Giroldi in the final moments of the doomeduprising.   Endara, the opposition's presidential candidate in May, tookrefuge in the Vatican's embassy after soldiers beat him and threwhim out of his office Thursday. Shortly before the assault, Noriegaclaimed he had evidence the United States planned to install Endaraas president.   Foreign observers said Endara's ticket won the May 7 election bya 3-1 margin, but Noriega had the results annulled May 10. U.S.officials have said they consider Endara the legitimate presidentof Panama.</TEXT></DOC>
