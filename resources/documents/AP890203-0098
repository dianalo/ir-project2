Gen. Andres Rodriguez, the son of a farmer, grew up in the ruraltown of San Salvador but now lives in a mansion in a plush suburb ofAsuncion.   Little is known of his early career, but Rodriguez, about 64, wasnamed commander of the First Army Corps in 1961. The corps, one ofthree, is the largest and best equipped in the army.   When Rodriguez attacked police headquarters and the presidentialguard to oust Stroessner, he had 40 to 50 tanks at his disposal plusmortars, cannons, recoilless rifles, heavy machine guns and manpower.   It was not clear why Rodriguez chose to unseat the 76-year-oldStroessner or why he acted when he did.   But diplomatic and political observers said that shortly beforethe coup, Rodriguez, a stocky man of medium height, was ordered byStroessner to retire as army commander and become defense minister.Rodriguez refused.   Opposition leader Domingo Laino speculated that Rodriguez actedbecause he had privately sided with the traditionalist wing of theruling Colorado Party, which has called for a transition to a moredemocratic government and sought to distance itself from Stroessner.   Rodriguez and Stroessner were personal friends as well asprofessional colleagues. Their families became joined whenRodriguez's daughter, Marta, married Stroessner's son, Alfredo.   Rodriguez was well known inside the capital, but the first timemany Paraguayans heard of him was this morning when he said in hisclipped, commanding voice on the radio that Stroessner was underarrest and he was ``taking command of the country from this moment.''</TEXT></DOC>
