Tate andamp; Lyle, a British-based company, said it intends to recoup perhaps $650 million of the $1.5 billion transaction, including preferred equity, by quickly selling off Staley's food-service business. While food service represents the bulk of Staley's sales, from the outset Tate andamp; Lyle was after Staley's high-fructose corn syrup business. With it, Tate andamp; Lyle becomes the only sugar refiner with a U.S. presence in all aspects of the sweetener business: cane and beet sugar, artificial sweeteners and high-fructose syrup.    Tate andamp; Lyle Chairman Neil M. Shaw said in an interview yesterday that once the purchase is completed, his company intends to move rapidly to strip corporate overhead from Staley, return the company's offices to Decatur, Ill., and improve efficiency and profitability in Staley's corn-refining business. &quot;I'd like to see this plant really hum,&quot; he said. Staley is now based in Rolling Meadows, Ill.    Although Staley had resisted the surprise offer for nearly a month, it capitulated late last week after realizing that Tate andamp; Lyle was serious about walking away if the $36.50-a-share offer, which came last Thursday, was turned down. Staley was holding out for $37, according to a person familiar with the negotiations, although a member of its board said that price was at the low end of the value estimate that Staley's investment bankers had put on the company. Arbitragers and other investors had bid Staley stock up as high as $39 in the past month.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Staley shares closed at $36.875 down 12.5 cents.    Sources close to the negotiations also said Staley's management seemed more willing to accept Tate andamp; Lyle's $36.50-a-share bid when they were assured their golden parachutes and other compensation packages would be part of the transaction. Those buy-outs, which could cost Tate andamp; Lyle upwards of $85 million, had been disparaged by Tate andamp; Lyle in court as &quot;a web of enrichment devices&quot; that were &quot;grossly excessive and wholly unjustified.&quot;    Management's perquisites &quot;dominated how they handled the whole negotiations,&quot; Mr. Shaw said.    Donald E. Nordlund, Staley's chairman and chief executive officer, couldn't be reached for comment over the weekend. Mr. Shaw indicated yesterday that he expects Mr. Nordlund to be among those senior executives who won't be retained when Staley changes hands.    Initially, Tate andamp; Lyle bid $32 a share for the 28,864,000 shares, or 95%, of common stock it didn't already own. Tate andamp; Lyle holds 1,500,000 shares and an estimated one million additional shares have been tendered to it in recent weeks. Staley's board, on the advice of investment bankers First Boston Corp. and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, rejected that offer, and a $35 bid that followed, as &quot;financially inadequate.&quot;    Henry M. Staley, a representative of the firm's founding family on Staley's board, said he was &quot;very disappointed in the price&quot; agreed to. &quot;But unfortunately there weren't any other bidders to bring the price up to where it ought to be.&quot; He also said that while the company had explored other alternatives to an outright sale, &quot;I don't think there was any burning desire to remain independent.&quot;    Staley's management and its representatives initially refused to make any contact with Tate andamp; Lyle, although a year ago Staley had sought out the British concern's willingness to act as a friendly suitor.That was when Staley said it faced a hostile takeover threat from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    But early last week Staley lawyers approached counterparts from Tate andamp; Lyle saying &quot;let's talk,&quot; according to a source close to the negotiations. The $36.50 price &quot;was an absolutely final offer,&quot; the source said. After Tate andamp; Lyle made it, its lawyers went out for hamburgers. Word of Staley's acceptance came during lunch; an agreement was signed in New York late Friday afternoon.    In addition to $36.50 cash for each common share, Tate andamp; Lyle agreed to pay $105 a share for each of 3,358 shares of $3.75 cumulative preferred stock, and $53.15 a share for each of 3,450,000 depositary preferred convertible shares. The $1.5 billion purchase price also includes $166 million for liquid yield option notes, and another $14 million for management stock options.    Tate andamp; Lyle's tender offer expires at midnight May 27. Should fewer than 90% of the common shares be tendered by then, Staley shareholders would have to vote on the offer.    To finance the acquisition, Tate andamp; Lyle has arranged a $1.3 billion borrowing facility from a 14-bank syndicate, and is raising another $400 million through an issue of convertible preference shares.    James Muir, Tate andamp; Lyle's finance director, said that the British company hasn't yet lined up a buyer for Staley's food-service division, which had 1987 annual sales of $2.5 billion. But Mr. Shaw said Staley has accumulated an extensive list of prospective buyers, and that he expects a sale of the operation soon. Staley's other main business, corn refining, had sales of $935.5 million last year.    ---   Peter Norman in London contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
