Robert White, undersecretary of commerce for technology,said the nationwide program will begin with a presentation bygovernment experts in Cambridge, Mass., on Feb. 11 and 12,and go on to the Research Triangle in North Carolina, toAustin, Texas, and to other communities with a highconcentration of high-technology industries. &quot;We'll tell themwhat the government can offer, what's available in thefederal labs, and how to make licensing arrangements,&quot; hesaid.</LP><TEXT>   The National Technology Initiative, as this program iscalled, will be a multiagency effort involving the Commerce,Defense, Energy and Transportation departments as well asother agencies.   Among other things, the initiative is intended toencourage U.S. companies to shop for commercially usefultechnology under liberalized conditions prescribed by the1988 Federal Technology Transfer Act. Since that law wasenacted federal agencies have entered into some 700cooperative research-and-development agreements with privateparties, but Mr. White said much more can be done consideringthat the federal government pours as much as $70 billion intoresearch activity every year.   The federal agencies with the largest number of suchagreements are the U.S. Agriculture Department, the NationalInstitutes of Health and the National Institute of Standardsand Technology, an arm of the Commerce Department. Theseagencies have spawned about a hundred agreements each, Mr.White said.   However, there is also useful technology to be found atthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and at the Sandia labin Albuquerque, N.M.; Lawrence Livermore lab in Livermore,Calif., and the Oak Ridge, Tenn., lab, he said. He cited aceramics venture by Adolph Coors Co. and the adaptation ofnew materials by Cummins Engine Co. as examples of successfulspinoffs from those labs.   The initiative also is intended to introduce the businesscommunity to the resources available at the department'sregional manufacturing technology centers in Troy, N.Y.;Columbus, S.C.; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Kansas City, Mo., andCleveland, Ohio.   Mr. White said that a Commerce Department directory ofscientists and experts working in various federal labs,complete with their telephone numbers, is publicly available,but &quot;people don't seem to know about it.&quot;   Acknowledging that financing could be a major stumblingblock to such partnerships, Mr. White will invite the Bostonfinancial community to attend the kickoff program at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;We'll be there tolisten as well to whatever problems businessmen have,&quot; hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
