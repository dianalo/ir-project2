However, the letter didn't add any new elements and didn't constitute a formal new offer.    John M. Lillie, chairman and chief executive officer of Lucky Stores, said in a prepared statement late Monday, &quot;The board has previously rejected the Edelman proposals and we are proceeding on the board-authorized restructuring program.&quot;    In September, Mr. Edelman, a New York investor, offered $35 a share for Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky and sweetened the bid in November to $37 a share, or a total of $1.95 billion. Lucky rejected both offers as inadequate, and launched a restructuring program including a spinoff of its troubled Gemco unit and a buyback of shares -- all intended to boost Lucky's share value and thwart Mr. Edelman.    Mr. Edelman wasn't available to elaborate on his latest move. But a spokesman for the Edelman group characterized the letter as simply an open-ended request for negotiations, and &quot;clearly not an offer.&quot;    In his letter, Mr. Edelman said: &quot;There is no assurance that the company will consummate various aspects of its proposed restructuring. Yet the shareholders are forced to approve the entrenching reincorporation in order to sell 27% of their shares to Lucky and to receive an overall value in the restructuring, which you apparently estimate will be substantially below our previous proposals.&quot;    Mr. Lillie said in the company's prepared statement Monday that the reincorporation in Delaware is an essential element in the restructuring program.    Noting that Lucky's shares were trading well below his $37-a-share bid, Mr. Edelman charged that it was management's restructuring plan, and not his bid, that was inadequate. &quot;I believe it is your responsibility to negotiate immediately with us in good faith for the sale of Lucky Stores to our group,&quot; the letter said.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Lucky shares closed at $31, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
