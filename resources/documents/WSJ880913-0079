Thin trading caused by a religious holiday added to the volatility.    December-delivery gold ended with a loss of 50 cents an ounce at $428, after at one point dropping to a new life-of-contract low of $425. December silver fell 0.50 cent an ounce to $6.5650. October platinum fell $5.70 an ounce to $520.10.    Precious metals generally, and gold in particular, are laboring under a negative psychology, according to Ian MacDonald, vice president of Credit Suisse, New York.    &quot;Developments such as the weakness in crude oil and the Federal Reserve's tightening of the money supply do not work in favor of gold,&quot; Mr. MacDonald said.    What is missing is a general investor demand for physical gold, which would be the &quot;swing&quot; factor, he said. &quot;Buying interest is excellent in the Middle East and in the Far East, but in Europe it isn't particularly good and in the U.S. at this stage it's very small,&quot; Mr. MacDonald said.    Traders apparently are waiting for the price of gold to drop to a point at which it is a bargain, he said.    &quot;If it does, it can attract widespead demand that would overcome any oversupply and provide the boost the market needs,&quot; Mr. MacDonald said.    Richard Hirsch, vice president and metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., New York, said current selling might carry prices lower.    On Friday, he noted, when the price of gold fell almost $8 an ounce in nearby contracts, the total open interest -- contracts outstanding that haven't been offset by opposite trades or delivery of the commodity -- rose 8,406 contracts, to 150,804 contracts.    &quot;This means that the wave of selling wasn't just traders bailing out, but significant new selling that could continue and push prices down even more,&quot; he said.    Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York, said that platinum played a larger part than oil yesterday in the fall and partial recovery in gold and silver prices.    &quot;Platinum, because of its natural thinness {in the volume of trading}, usually tends to have an exaggerated reaction, up or down, to developments,&quot; he said. Yesterday, because many traders were out in observance of the religious holiday, that thinness was exaggerated.    &quot;As a result, gold and silver were dragged down more by platinum than by crude oil,&quot; he said. &quot;There was heavy stop-loss selling in October-delivery platinum at $512.50, when crude oil hadn't yet reached it's low point, and that helped gold and silver drop to their lows of the day,&quot; he said.    William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York, noted that since 1981, precious metals prices haven't been able to sustain or add to advances and have had a tendency to fall back quickly to previous lows.    For example, he noted that the December 1988 gold contract fell to a life-of-contract low of $430.80 on Feb. 18, 1987. Nine months later, on Nov. 19, it rose to $546, its high point, only to fall to a new life-of-contract low yesterday.    &quot;It's that kind of negative behavior that has dampened buying interest in precious metals and kept the market under pressure,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Futures prices rose on concern over South American supply disruptions. December-delivery copper ended at $1.02 a pound for a gain of 0.65 cent a pound, after rising to a new life-of-contract high of $1.0245. According to one analyst, the head of a Chilean copper union has called for a one-day work stoppage. The analyst said traders recalled the recent Peruvian strike, which lasted a month, and the shipment delays that resulted. &quot;There is also the worry that labor problems may pop up again in Peru,&quot; he said.    COFFEE: Futures prices ended lower after rising on continuing concern over dry weather in Brazilian growing areas. December-delivery coffee ended at $1.2855 a pound, down 1.61 cents, after trading as high as $1.33. Analysts and dealers said that while it is understandable that the prolonged dry spell in Brazil is causing some worries, history suggests it's too early to be deeply concerned. It isn't until the buds that will produce next year's crop appear on the trees late this month and next month that dryness will increasingly become a factor. Trade sources point out that in previous prolonged dry spells, rains in the middle of October have enabled the trees to produce a normal crop.    COTTON: Futures prices showed little change, as traders awaited a government production estimate and monitored the progress of Hurricane Gilbert in the Gulf of Mexico. December-delivery cotton ended at 52.66 cents a pound, down 0.54 cent. After the close of trading, the Department of Agriculture estimated U.S. production of cotton from the 1988-89 crop at 14.7 million bales, down from the 14.9 million bales estimated last month. The latest estimate was neutral to very slightly bullish, analysts said. More important, they said, was the hurricane's progress. &quot;If it hits into Texas, Mississippi or Louisiana, it could cause severe damage to the crop, which is only beginning to be harvested in the Delta,&quot; said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York. </TEXT></DOC>
