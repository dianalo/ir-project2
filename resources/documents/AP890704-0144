(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Ronald Reagansuffered minor injuries Tuesday when he was thrown from a horsewhile vacationing in Mexico, and he was treated at an Army hospitalnear here, officials said.   Reagan, 78, suffered mostly bruises and some minor scrapes, saidhis spokesman, Mark Weinberg. ``He said he feels fine,'' Weinbergsaid.   Doctors who checked Reagan at Fort Huachuca's Raymond W. BlissArmy Community Hospital in southeastern Arizona pronounced him inexcellent condition, Weinberg said in a telephone statement to newsagencies in Los Angeles.   After treatment, Reagan returned to a private ranch in Sonora, aMexican state across the Arizona line, where Reagan has beenvacationing since Saturday, officials said.   The accident apparently occurred around 10:05 a.m. MST, saidCapt. Juan Lopez, a U.S. Army doctor who examined Reagan at thehospital.   ``The horse Reagan was riding bucked wildly several times on arocky downhill slope and eventually stumbled,'' throwing Reagan,Weinberg said.   The former president joked that the accident was ``my own privaterodeo,'' Weinberg said. The spokesman said Reagan is ``an excellentrider and he held on quite a while.''   A U.S. Army helicopter flew Reagan to the hospital from theranch, officials said. Reagan arrived at Fort Huachuca at 11:20a.m., said Maj. Dennis Seely, a base spokesman.   X-rays revealed no serious injuries, Weinberg said.   Reagan joked while in the hospital, and did not complain of anypain, Lopez said. The doctor said the only advice he gave Reagan wasnot to get involved in any stressful exercise for the rest of theweek.   Reagan was released from the hospital at 3:10 p.m. Accompanied byhis wife, Nancy, he left the hospital and walked quickly to awaiting Army helicopter, which departed for the ranch in Mexico.   Lopez said Reagan declined to stay overnight, as physicianssuggested, so the hospital's chief nurse, Lt. Col. Paul Farineau,accompanied the former president back to Mexico.   Lopez said he would travel to Mexico on Wednesday to do afollow-up check on Reagan.   At the hospital, Mrs. Reagan was visited by June Scobee, widow ofspace shuttle Challenger pilot Dick Scobee, Weinberg said. Mrs.Scobee came by to wish the Reagans well and to tell Mrs. Reagan howmuch she appreciated her support and kindness at the time of the1986 Challenger disaster.   The ranch is owned by William Wilson, a friend of the Reagans andformer U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. The former president plans tocelebrate Mrs. Reagan's birthday there on Thursday before returningto his Los Angeles home at the end of the week, Weinberg said.   Reagan took up riding when he was a young sportscaster in DesMoines, Iowa in the 1930s and pursued it enthusiastically rightthrough his presidency. He would often take off one afternoon a weekto go riding at the Marine base in Quantico, Va.   He once said, ``There is nothing better for the insides of a manthan the outside of a horse.''   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush was informed of Reagan'saccident by the Secret Service at 3:30 p.m., just before Bush wentboating, White House spokesman Bill Harlow said.   ``The president was relieved to hear that President Reagan isOK,'' Harlow said. ``He'll be calling him at some point.''   Lt. Gen. Thurmond D. Rodgers, ranking officer at Fort Huachuca,said Reagan told him to ``make sure people know that I was thrownfrom the horse. I did not fall.''</TEXT></DOC>
