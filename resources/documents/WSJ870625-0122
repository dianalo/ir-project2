They also seemed intent on easing a rift over how to achieve their pricing goal in the interests of harmony and stability. Any public disagreement, they fear, could scuttle the oil-market recovery that has brought prices back up to around $18 a barrel today from a level under $10 a barrel last year.    &quot;I think we should keep our meeting short and say very little,&quot; said Manei Saeed Al-Otaiba, the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, in an interview. He and other sources said, however, that opinion in OPEC is split on production strategy.    One camp -- to which the UAE minister strongly adheres -- believes the organization should stick to its December plan to let production rise from the present 15.8 million barrels a day quota to 16.6 million in the third quarter and again to 18.3 million barrels a day for the fourth quarter.    &quot;We should stick to this and not meet again before December,&quot; Mr. Otaiba said. This view is supported by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar, as well as the UAE. The four countries form the strong bloc of Arab oil producers in OPEC.    Another group, led by Iran and Algeria, feels that there is too much oil around and that demand for it hasn't lived up to OPEC's expectations. Therefore, this group says, OPEC should freeze production at current levels.    Independent industry sources say OPEC's output currently exceeds the prescribed 15.8 million barrels-a-day ceiling. Iraq, which doesn't adhere to the current OPEC agreement, is pumping oil without restraint at a level of about two million barrels a day, while other OPEC members exceed their agreed quotas. Altogether OPEC is believed to be producing about 16.5 million barrels a day.    &quot;The ideal outcome of this meeting is if they maintain the price at $18 a barrel and raise output to 16.6 (million barrels a day) next quarter, but refrain from implementing any further increase in production,&quot; said Paul D. Mlotok, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst observing the meeting. OPEC sources said that is the sort of compromise the organization is aiming for.    OPEC will start its meeting today, and most ministers here said they would like to end it by Sunday. This sharply contrasts with last year's OPEC meetings, one of which lasted 17 days.    The basic agreement among all 13 countries is that oil prices should continue to hover around $18 a barrel. The Arab gulf group adamantly opposes any significant rise beyond that price. &quot;You don't want to see the price go up because this will harm the oil (demand) recovery,&quot; says Mr. Otaiba. </TEXT></DOC>
