(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Access does nicelyandM;Open Access III is a very large integrated package, similar in concept toSymphony and Microsoft Works.andP;  However, SPI (the authors) would probablyregard the comparisons as unflattering, as Open Access is a larger, morecomplex and more expensive product.andP;  Its main components include a database,a spreadsheet, a comms package and a word processor, in addition to deskaccessories and utilities.andM;Open Access arrived as the biggest shrink-wrapped object I've ever seen.andO;Once the wraps were off, three ring-bound files and a box of floppy diskswere revealed.andP;  The manuals are of the 'build it yourself' variety, whichisn't great in a package costing just under 700 pounds.andP;  The box of diskscontains 28 5-1/4-inch floppy disks, a record only beaten (in my experience)by Ingress, which has 31.andM;The package will run on a twin floppy disk drive machine and requires 320Kbor 448Kb with the spell checker in place.andP;  For the review I installed OpenAccess on a 386 Opus; most users will be running it on a more sophisticatedmachine.andM;Database and programmerandM;Most integrated packages have one strong component around which the othersrevolve: Symphony, for example, has its spreadsheet; Open Access has itsdatabase.andM;The database component uses classic database terminology: records, fields,data types and keyfields are all here.andP;  Using the menu-driven systemprovided, it's relatively easy for beginners to construct a databasestructure.andP;  As this is never an easy operation to learn, SPI has tried tomake it a little more intuitive than it is in, say, dBase.andM;Instead of listing field names, data types and so on, users are encouraged todesign a data entry screen by choosing field names and simply choosing aplace to position them on the screen.andP;  After the screen has been laid out ina satisfactory manner, the next step is to assign attributes to each field.andM;As well as the expected attributes such as data type and display width,features such as Unique-Key, Auto-Increment, Must Fill and so on are easilyset for a given field.andM;Open Access has full relational capabilities, allowing multiple files to beinterlinked.andP;  The database can be queried in three ways--Query By Example,SQL (see SQL in Open Access and SQLVision box) and Stored Query.andM;A 'Browse' option is provided, which is again better than dBase's offering.andO;This one splits the screen, allowing users to browse through the key fieldson one side, while viewing the entire current record on the other.andP;  Tablescan be constructed, there's a report generator and macros are supported.andP;  Allin all, there's little missing from Open Access's database section.andM;As you might expect, there's a programming language and environment,rejoicing in the name 'Programmer'.andP;  It's described as an English-likelanguage, and is rather similar to Basic, with a collection of extra commandsand functions which are relevant to database management.andM;Some example commands are: APPEND BROWSE LOCK USEandM;and functions include: DB_SUM DB_MEAN DB_STDEVandM;To my surprise, graphics commands are also included, making it easy togenerate graphs from data in the database.andP;  In the same way, menus are easyto produce and an attractive user interface can be constructed with minimumeffort.andM;For those whose programs have bugs, there's trace pane so that you can watchprogram execution and a symbol table to help you keep an eye on all of yourvariables.andM;Variables can be of the Integer, Floating Point, String, Date, Time orLogical types.andP;  Unfortunately, variables don't have to be formally declared,but (happily) the practice is recommended.andP;  Undefined variables are possibleand can lead to memory problems.andM;Rather like dBase, Programmer supports procedural calls, conditionalstatements and case statements.andP;  A compiler and run-time system are availableto allow the generation of programs that can run from DOS.andM;Word processorandM;If the database is the jewel in the crown of Open Access, then its wordprocessor is a bit of an also-ran.andM;Let's look at its good points.andP;  It has an autosave feature, triggered by auser-defined period of keyboard inactivity.andP;  The spell checker can check awhole document at once, part of a document, or text as it's typed in (in amanner that is vaguely reminiscent of Borland's Lightning).andM;A range of languages for the spell checker are available from SPI, includingFrench, Spanish, Dutch and German--useful as 1992 looms.andM;One advantage of an integrated package is immediately apparent; it's possibleto set up the word processor so that all control codes are automaticallystripped out if text is placed in the clipboard.andP;  It should be easy to writematerial in the word processor and then transfer it to the database, commspackage and so on.andM;Paragraph styles can be saved, as can abbreviations, rather like style sheetsand glossaries in Microsoft's Word.andP;  Characters can be set to bold, italicand underlined.andM;Mail-merge is clearly an important feature of an integrated package.andP;  OpenAccess's word processor can take information from its own database or fromDIF files.andP;  Field names can be substituted in the normal way, and thesubstitutions can be made conditional (if the name field is blank then insert'Customer'; otherwise insert the contents of the name field).andP;  It's alsopossible to retrieve data for mail-merging with SQL commands.andM;So, if all this is good, why do I complain?andP;  Well, anyone moving to OpenAccess from a modern word processor like Word or WordPerfect is in for ashock.andP;  The slightly more exotic character formats such as redline and smallcapitals are missing.andP;  Although the page breaks can be viewed, there's nopreview facility and What You See Is Definitely Not What You Get.andP;  There's nothesaurus, and swapping between Insert and Overwrite (Exchange in SPI-speak)also alters the amount of information displayed on the screen.andM;The word processor, therefore, isn't up to the best of the modern packages.andO;It's perfectly adequate for everyday purposes, though.andM;SpreadsheetandM;The spreadsheet section of Open Access seems a little more together than theword processor.andP;  The worksheet contains 270x9960 cells, which is more thanmost other spreadsheets around (filing them all would require a lot ofmemory, however).andP;  The columns and rows are identified in the conventionalmanner with letters and numbers.andM;Labels, numbers and formulae may be written into cells as per normal, andformulae follow Lotus conventions rather than SuperCalc ones.andP;  A typicalformula might be +b34+b35.andM;The function and range identifications aren't in true Lotus style, though.andO;For example, they may take the form + sum (A1:b4).andP;  All the usual standardfunctions are included -- MIN, MAX, STD and so on.andM;The graphical abilities within the spreadsheet are really very limited, butthen it's the work of a moment to move the figures (via a DIF file) to theexcellent Graph option among the Desk Accessories.andM;3D abilities are all the rage at the moment and, while Open Access doesn'tpretend to be 3D, it has the ability to form links between the currentworksheet and several others.andP;  The + EXTRN function can be used to retrievethe contents of individual cells from any number of other worksheets.andP;  Inaddition, the Xternal command allows up to three channels to be establishedwith other worksheets from which any cell can then be accessed with theminimum of effort.andM;Macros are rather briefly covered in the manual and there's no 'learn'facility to ease the pain of writing them.andP;  New users will be left in thedark here, which is a shame because macros are so useful.andP;  On the other hand,a goal-seeking ability has been provided which is well explained.andP;  Thisallows the spreadsheets to adjust numbers until they provide the answers thatyou want, which is very handy for cooking the books!andM;Unless you happen to need the best in spreadsheets, Open Access will provideall you require.andM;CommunicationandM;The idea of a comms package built into an integrated package has a certainappeal.andP;  Files for transmission can be built up from data in any of themodules, edited and transmitted without ever leaving the package.andP;  OpenAccess also has the ability to allow your computer to serve as a bulletinboard.andM;Kermit, XModem and Text are supported for Transmit and Receive and, inaddition, there are facilities to send material directly from an editingarea.andM;StatisticsandM;Those who need to perform ANOVAR, correlations, CHI-squared functions and thelike will be delighted to browse through the statistics section wherein allof these and more can be performed.andM;Desktop utilitiesandM;It's possible to call up a collection of utilities at the touch of a key fromanywhere within Open Access.andP;  Some of these are fun and could be useful, suchas Alarm, Appointments, Stopwatch and Calculator.andM;Two of them are potentially much more useful than the heading 'Utilities'would suggest.andP;  Mailbox allows a simple mailing system to be set up on thenetworked version, and Graph allows presentation quality graphics to beproduced from any numerical data that you have anywhere in Open Access.andO;These are better quality than can be obtained from a typical spreadsheet --in fact they could even be said to rival Borland's Quattro.andM;Language CallsandM;For more advanced users, there's a section of the manual devoted to makingcall to C from Open Access 'Language Calls'.andP;  SPI has a library of severalhundred functions which can be used by Language Calls.andP;  These aren't includedin the package as supplied, since they will be of interest to only a smallnumber of users.andP;  Such tools again stress that this is a serious package,allowing it to be developed in whatever direction the user requires.andM;Networking and file lockingandM;As supplied, Open Access will run over a network, allowing up to foursimultaneous users.andP;  Supported networks are Novell and NetBIOS.andM;Networking, of course, allows shared access to data with all of theadvantages which that allows.andP;  However, particularly with a relationaldatabase, the sophistication of data locking is important, since crude filelocking can be guaranteed to bring the system to a halt.andM;Open Access has different levels of locking for different applications.andP;  Forexample, if one user opens a document file from the word processor, then theentire file is automatically locked and becomes inaccessible to other users.andO;However, database files will have only individual records, or groups ofrecords locked at any one time.andM;DocumentationandM;The 'Getting Started' manual suggests that users should back up all the disksbefore installing.andP;  I bet most people don't have the spare hour for this and,as I did, will install the package from the originals.andP;  The install programasks fairly standard questions about your printer, screen type and so on.andP;  Assupplied, Open Access can be installed as single-user or network versions.andP;  Iinstalled it as a single-user version, which took about 15 minutes.andP;  Nowherein the documentation could I discover how much of the hard disk would beneeded, but in practice it took under 3Mb.andM;'Getting Started' continues with a quick tour of the main features of OpenAccess.andP;  The help system is first on the agenda.andP;  All of the Open Accessreference manuals are available via the hyper help key (Alt-F1).andP;  You couldargue about whether this really is HyperText, but it's a useful help systemto have on-line.andP;  All of the help files are supplied as ASCII files, and canbe customized for your own purposes.andP;  This emphasizes that the product isreally for use within a company large enough to have a person in charge ofmicros, who'd presumably perform the customization.andM;New users are advised to move on to the chunky 400-page 'Learning Open AccessIII' manual.andP;  This has several tutorials on each of the components of OpenAccess.andP;  Each tutorial tells you how long it should take to complete, makesyou do some work and then reviews what you should have learnt by asking aseries of questions.andP;  Someone has taken a lot of trouble to make this packageeasy to learn.andP;  Many people won't read the manuals, but at least they'll knowthat friendly tutorials are there.andM;The final part of the documentation consists of the reference manuals foreach component.andP;  These aren't as turgid as the name suggests, and areprobably the most useful of all the documentation.andP;  Overall, thedocumentation deserves praise.andM;ConclusionandM;Once started, the program presents a rather old-fashioned appearance.andP;  Thisseems to be at odds with the modernistic, not to say surrealistic imageryused to advertise Open Access.andP;  There are menus, but they don't float (exceptin the HyperText help system), and the function key definitions on screen aresurrounded by andless; andgt; symbols, which again gives it an old-fashioned feel.andO;Floating menus aren't in any way obligatory in a modern package; I'm just alittle surprised that they haven't been implemented here.andM;These are just a few minor gripes, however.andP;  As I got more into using thepackage I found that I grew to admire its strengths, and such complaints fellby the wayside.andM;Overall, this is a well integrated package.andP;  It has a strong database, moreuseful components than other integrated packages and the transfer of databetween them is relatively easy.andM;So if you're thinking of standardizing by shelling out on an integratedpackage, and have the requisite budget, Open Access is well worthconsidering.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
