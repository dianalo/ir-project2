The base-rate cuts, effective today and the second in two weeks, were triggered yesterday afternoon when the Bank of England cut the rate at which it was prepared to lend funds in the pound-denominated money market. The central bank decided to act after a dismal morning on London's stock exchange; nearly #15 billion ($26.2 billion) was wiped off British share values as the Financial Times 100-share index, which tracks the top 100 British shares, plunged 88.5 points, through the psychologically important level of 1600, to 1565.4 in intraday trading.    But the base-rate cut prompted only a partial recovery in share prices, with the stock index closing at 1608.1, down 45.8 points. John Shepperd, an economist at the brokerage Warburg Securities Ltd. who specializes in the British government-bond market, said further interest-rate cuts may lie ahead if equity markets don't bottom out soon. &quot;In the short term, the trend is clearly downwards,&quot; he said.    The midafternoon timing of the Bank of England's action was &quot;not unprecedented, but extremely unusual,&quot; Mr. Shepperd said. British authorities usually signal they want interest-rate changes late in the morning. Indeed, in an early-morning radio interview yesterday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson hinted that interest-rates cuts weren't imminent. It is &quot;unwise to be impatient,&quot; he said.    Barclays Bank PLC cut its base rate first, and other major banks quickly followed. The half-percentage-point cut was the second one of that size since global stock prices plunged Oct. 19. The base rate is the fee that British banks use to calculate their other lending charges.    Unlike British banks' Oct. 26 reduction from 10%, the latest drop had an immediate ripple effect on important lending rates outside the traditional banking sector. Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest savings-and-loan association, yesterday said it will lower its mortgage rate to 10.3% from 11.25%, starting Monday.    Treasury and Bank of England officials said they decided to lower interest rates in response to tightening monetary conditions. The stock market's decline yesterday was one factor because it took wealth out of the British economy. Another trigger was the renewed strength yesterday of the British pound against both the dollar and the West German mark.    Lower interest rates are a traditional way of reducing the attraction of a strong currency on foreign-exchange markets. The record #6.7 billion jump in Britain's gold and foreign-currency reserves during October showed that the Bank of England has been intervening very heavily in currency markets to stem the pound's rise. Analysts in the City, London's financial district, said continued intervention on such a scale could make it more difficult for the central bank to control monetary conditions.    Some private economists said the base-rate cut has a wider international significance. Gerald Holtham, international economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., said the rate cut was a &quot;shot across the bows of the Germans.&quot; Mr. Lawson is trying to tell the Bundesbank that it also should cut rates because the risks to the world economy are &quot;all on the deflationary side&quot; since stock markets began their decline, Mr. Holtham said.    Alan Budd, the head of forecasting at the London Business School, said Britain cut interest rates &quot;in the hope of a world-wide move to lower interest rates.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
