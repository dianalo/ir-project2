No early reports of damage surfaced.   ``Virus'' is computer jargon for a fragment of computer program,or software, that can copy itself into other programs and usuallyis destructive.   An unidentified saboteur planted the Black Friday virus and itspread to thousands of personal computers this year as users copiedor used each others' software.   Infected computers were hit in two ways. The virus slowed downthe computer and also specified that programs activated on Friday,May 13, would be wiped out.   Data stored in the computers would not be affected.   ``It's a time bomb that penetrates your computer without yourbeing able to know about it,'' said Shay Bushinsky, a TelAviv-based computer consultant.   ``The perfect analogy is AIDS. If you don't exchange programswith others, you remain immune, but if you freely copy yourfriend's software, you are in danger of being contaminated.''   No figures were available on the extent of the contaminationamong Israel's 90,000 personal computer users, but Bushinskyestimated that the infection rate reached 100 percent among heavyusers.   Hebrew University researchers detected the Black Friday virus onDec. 24 because of a flaw in its design, said Yisrael Radai, asenior programmer at the university.   Instead of infecting each program once, the virus attacheditself to the program every time it was used, consuming increasingamounts of memory space.   Computer experts noticed that supposedly static programs weregrowing in size. After an intensive search they isolated the virus.   The university then developed ``anti-viral'' software and madeit available to the school's hundreds of personal computer usersfree of charge, said Radai.   To be on the safe side, users affiliated with the universitywere also urged not to activate their computers on Friday, May 13,he added.   Software companies joined the fight.   The Tel Aviv-based Iris company developed an anti-virus programand sold 4,000 copies, said President Ofer Ahituv. He estimatedthat 30 percent of his company's 6,000 customers, most of thembusinesses, had been infected.   Ahituv and other computer experts said they had no immediatereports of damage Friday, apparently because most users were warnedin time.   Black Friday was the first destructive virus to contaminatepersonal computers in Israel, but programmers predicted there wouldbe others.   They said one reason Israeli users are vulnerable is thatsoftware prices here are about twice as high as in the UnitedStates, and many Israelis freely copy programs, often disregardingcopyright restrictions.   Ahituv speculated that the saboteur may have been a frustratedprogrammer ``who finally got fed up because everyone was copyinghis software, and then said `let all the software be destroyed.'''</TEXT></DOC>
