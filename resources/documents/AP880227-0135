(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Northwest Airlines planes continued flyingSaturday and a union spokesman said strike preparations by 6,700flight attendants were ``put on hold'' even though all-nightcontract talks hit a snag.   Consensus was reached on all issues except wages during a22-hour bargaining session, said William Wren, Northwest's vicepresident for public relations. But union officials said there wereother issues still unsettled.   Wren said he did not know when talks might resume.   The union's rank-and-file negotiating committee met lateSaturday afternoon to receive direction from about 20 Teamstersunit representatives from around the country, said William Genoese,international director of the Teamsters airline division.   Genoese said a strike was still possible, though he said talkswith Northwest might be resumed.   Genoese also threatened what he termed ``guerrilla warfare'' _which he defined as a decline in attentiveness by flight attendants_ should there be no settlement or support for a strike.   ``When you beat up on the workers who service the passengers,they beat up on the passengers,'' he said. ``You can't beat up onpeople in a service business.'' He had made the same threat a weekago against another airline, Pan Am, after those talks broke off,but no significant disruption in service has been reported, Pan Amsaid.   A request by the federal mediator involved in the Northwesttalks to delay a strike helped avert a walkout Saturday morning, hesaid.   ``The government wants to take another crack at this,'' he said.``It was 8 in the morning and everybody had been working all night.Maybe some of the numbers fell through the cracks.''   The airline proposes to stretch from five to nine years the timein which an employee advances from a ``B'' or lower pay scale tothe ``A'' schedule, a change the union is resisting, unionofficials said.   In another area of disagreement, the union wants a three-yearcontract rather than the 4{-year pact offered by the airline. Also,the sides are divided over the issue of retroactive pay,negotiators said.   Earlier, in the morning, Genoese said workers were being told towalk out.   Teamsters Local 2747 spokesman Jeff Musto said, however, that nostrike had been called, and spot checks by The Associated Press atairports around the nation served by the nation's fifth largestairline found no pickets or other strike activity. Airlineoperations were reported normal from Honolulu to Boston.   ``On any given day you're subject to some delayed flights, butwe're operating as scheduled normally,'' Wren said Saturdayafternoon.   There was a 20-minute work stoppage early Saturday at Detroit'sMetropolitan Airport, union spokesman Richard Leebove said, addingthat about 200 Northwest machinists joined 70 flight attendantsSaturday afternoon in a rally at the airport.   Many of the 75 flight attendants who assembled at strikeheadquarters in Eagan for picketing duty left by noon.   Representatives for the airlines and the union had continuednegotiations after a midnight EST deadline Friday, but thenegotiations recessed Saturday morning.   ``We did everything we possibly could to avoid a strike,''Genoese said during the morning. ``Apparently the company feels itwants to take a strike on. If we want to close down the airline, wecan close it down.''   A spokesman for Northwest said the airline was prepared to carryout its strike-management program, but hoped that talks wouldresume.   About 2,000 managers trained as flight attendants were postedthroughout the Northwest system with 200 newly hired replacementflight attendants also ready to move, said Terry Erskine, theairline's vice president for law and labor relations.   There was no immediate word on whether flight attendant picketlines would be honored by pilots or machinists.   Tyler said the machinists are under a contract that forbids themto strike in sympathy with another union; the pilots' union said nodecision had been made on its role.   Since Northwest acquired Republic Airlines in 1986, formerRepublic flight attendants have been working under their oldcontract, and many former Republic employees are paid less thantheir Northwest counterparts.   Northwest is trying to bring the workers under one contract andoffered to bring former Republic employees up to the salary levelsof Northwest employees. But the union claimed the airline iscompensating by reducing vacation pay and retirement benefits.   Meanwhile, Pan Am Corp. is continuing negotiations with theTeamsters, which represent 4,500 Pan Am reservations agents,customer service employees and other ground workers. The union hadthreatened to strike because management is seeking $35 million inconcessions.   Formal talks broke off last weekend and a strike deadlinepassed, but the employees kept working and informal talks havecontinued by telephone, Pan Am spokesman James A. Arey saidSaturday.   There was no evidence the Teamsters carried out a threat of``guerrilla warfare'' at Pan Am, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
