Dr. Sullivan willinclude these and other provisions in an anti-smoking code heplans to recommend that states adopt when he testifies todaybefore the Senate Finance Committee, HHS officials said.   Although 44 states have laws banning the sale ofcigarettes to minors, the laws generally are looselyenforced, if at all. Studies show that most adults who smokestarted when they were minors. Dr. Sullivan believes that oneof the best ways to fight smoking is to discourage minorsfrom taking up the habit.   Meanwhile, critics said Harvard's move could spark a waveof pressure on shareholders to sell tobacco stocks, much likethe movement to persuade universities and state governmentsto dump holdings in firms doing business in South Africa.   Several anti-industry efforts already have begun. BradKrevor, director of the Tobacco Divestment Project in Boston,said his newly formed group plans to contact hospitals,insurers and state pension funds. Also in Massachusetts, abill cosponsored by state Rep. John Bussinger is beingconsidered that would require the state to divest itself ofall tobacco stock.   Harvard President Derek Bok disclosed the sale in a letterdated May 18 to students at the university's School of PublicHealth. He said the divestiture was prompted by recognitionof the dangers of smoking and concern over aggressivemarketing tactics to promote smoking among teen-agers and incountries where the dangers of smoking aren't widely known.   As of June 30, 1989, when the divestitures began, Harvardowned shares of tobacco companies worth $58 million,including $41 million of Philip Morris Cos. shares. Harvardcontinues indirectly to own part of RJR Nabisco Inc. as partof a limited partnership managed by the leveraged buy-outfirm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   &quot;When the president of Harvard comes out and says, `Thisis dirty money, I don't want any part of it,' that's going tocause a pretty strong ripple effect across the country,&quot; saidGreg Connolly, an official at the Massachusetts Department ofPublic Health. &quot;It could be the start of a nationwide trend.&quot;   The divestiture movement has taken a long time to pick upany steam. As long ago as 1981, the American MedicalAssociation vowed to rid its investment portfolio of holdingsin tobacco companies. In 1987, the AMA called on medicalschools and their parent universities to divest holdings intobacco stocks, but there was little response to the call.   Besides the efforts in Massachusetts, City University ofNew York has resolved to sell its holdings in tobaccocompanies, according to Mr. Krevor. City University officialscouldn't be reached for comment.   The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association's CollegeRetirement Equities Funds, a nationwide pension system foremployees of colleges and universities, launched a SocialChoice Account in March. The new account doesn't invest fundsin companies that market tobacco or alcohol, among othercriteria.   But the Investor Responsibility Research Center, whichtracks social issues for investors, said it wasn't aware ofany other university or investment funds divesting shares intobacco companies.   That lack of interest may result, in part, from the factthat most tobacco stocks, despite their embattled image, havebeen strong performers. Last year, Philip Morris stockoutperformed the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index by 36%,and is ahead by another 5% this year, according to MarcCohen, a tobacco analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.   A spokesman for Philip Morris wouldn't comment on thepossibility of increased anti-tobacco activism on the part ofholders. &quot;Stockholders can make decisions based on anycriteria they choose to employ,&quot; he said. &quot;But as a Harvardgrad, I hope they invest in an equally profitablecorporation.&quot; A spokesman for American Brands Inc. declinedto comment on the Harvard decision. Officials of LoewsCorp.'s Lorillard Inc. unit couldn't be reached.   The model code that Dr. Sullivan plans to recommend todayto the states will incorporate parts of existing statutes.Advisers said he will propose that:   -- Vending machines, which account for about 16% ofillegal cigarette sales to minors, be banned or limited tobars, offices, and other places used largely by adults.   -- Retailers be required to obtain licenses to sellcigarettes. Currently, 31 states license vendors. Retailerswho sell to minors would run the risk of having theirlicenses suspended or revoked.   -- Civil fines be levied against retailers who sell tominors.   -- Signs warning that sales to minors are illegal beposted at all points of sale.   Dr. Sullivan also is considering ways to restrictcigarette advertising aimed at minors, but officials say hemay not be ready to announce any such initiatives today.   ---   Joseph Pereira contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
