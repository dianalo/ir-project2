In Kuwait, before its annexation, Iraq did exactly whatVietnam did in Cambodia on December 1978: massive attacksusing hundreds of tanks, heavy artillery, airplanes andthousands of infantrymen; a setting up of a puppetgovernment; the dispatching of settlers; then the so-calledwithdrawal of regular forces leaving only &quot;volunteers.&quot;   The difference between the Vietnamese case and that ofIraq is that Iraq has now annexed Kuwait while Vietnamcontinues to try to integrate Cambodia into its &quot;IndochineseFederation.&quot; Vietnam has not yet succeeded, after havingtried for more than 11 years, thanks on the one hand to theexistence of a Cambodian National Resistance under theleadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and on the other tothe firm support of the member nations of ASEAN and othercountries espousing the values of peace and justice.</LP><TEXT>   The Vietnamese lesson, well learned by Iraq, gives onefood for thought: The commander in chief of the Royal ThaiArmy, during his visit to inspect troops in the easternregion, has clearly warned them against a &quot;possibleintervention of foreign troops from Cambodia,&quot; referring tothe recent Iraqi invasion. On this subject, the deputy primeminister of Singapore has used language even more firm andhas launched an unequivocal warning. The other nations of theworld, especially those of middle and small size, withoutmentioning them, should not be far from sharing the fear.   Unfortunately, the U.S. and Western Europe (the CommonMarket) are heading for a dialogue with Vietnam and aresumption of aid to this country, which would signify theacceptance by the Western nations of the Vietnamese faitaccompli in Cambodia. A de facto recognition by the Westernnations and the Western press of the Phnom Penh regime set upby Vietnamese tanks and carried out through the various formsof Vietnamese presence would prove to Iraq and others thatacts of aggression will pay off as long as one has theaudacity and patience.   Is it not a bitter lesson for us, the little andmiddle-size states, and equally for those who are friends ofthe West?
