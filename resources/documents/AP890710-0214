Nordid the ``Clothed'' version and most other Goya paintings.   Velasquez' famous ``Maids of Honor'' and El Greco's ``The Dreamof Philip II'' stayed away, too, as shipping them was considered toorisky.   However, 73 other Spanish masterpieces that also survived Spain'sCivil War in 1936-39 are currently on show at Geneva's Museum of Artand History, marking the 50th anniversary of an unprecedentedinternational art salvage operation.   Shortly before midnight Feb. 13, 1939, 22 French railway carscrammed with 1,868 crates rolled into Geneva's freightyard under apioneering accord reached at Figueras between an international groupof art experts and the Spanish Loyalist government.   The cargo ranged from the treasures of Madrid's Prado Museum topriceless tapestries and ancient manuscripts. The inventory filled193 pages, listing 43 Grecos, 45 works by Velasquez and 138 Goyasamong the 1,300 paintings. Some had been brought over footpathsacross the nearby Spanish-French border before being put on therailway cars in Perpignan.   The addressee was Joseph Avenol, Secretary General of the Leagueof Nations, the Geneva-based forerunner of the United Nations.Avenol, a French diplomat, reluctantly agreed to take charge of thehoard, storing it at the vast library of the newly-built Palais desNations, now the U.N. Office in Geneva.   Arduous negotiations preceded the transfer to Geneva, last stopin an odyssey that began Nov. 10, 1936, four days before besiegedMadrid came under intensive aerial bombardment. Nine incendiarybombs hit the Prado but the most important works of art had alreadybeen removed from the museum.   They were taken first to Valencia, then to the Barcelona regionand finally to Figueras where the accord to place the treasuresunder the personal guardianship of Avenol was signed late on Feb. 3.The signing was done by the light of matches because nationalistbombs had caused a blackout, according to documentation prepared forGeneva's three-month anniversary show by Spanish historian ArturoColorado Castellary.   Avenol, sticking to the League of Nations' controversial``non-interventionist'' policy, agreed to take charge of the hoardonly after an international committee of independent art experts wasformed to negotiate the transfer.   The committee was headed by David David-Weill, president ofFrance's Council of National Museums, who also contributed most ofthe private donations which funded the operation. It includedBritish, French, U.S., Dutch, Belgian and Swiss members.   At the last minute, the Spaniards had a clause inserted whichstipulated that once peace was reestablished, all objects must bereturned ``only to the government of Spain to remain as the commonproperty of the Spanish nation.''   In his memoirs, Loyalist Foreign Minister Julio Alvarez del Vayowrote this was meant to make sure that the national patrimony wouldnot wind up ``in the hands of Hitler and Mussolini'' who backed thenationalist insurgents with bombers and ground forces.   Suggestions to send the paintings to the United States hadalready been declined in 1937 because of Washington's growingsympathy with the insurgents led by Gen. Francisco Franco, accordingto Alvarez del Vayo. Only a few weeks after the Figueras accord,Franco brought all of Spain under his control.   The new nationalist government demanded the immediate return ofthe art treasures. On May 10, a special train left Geneva for Spainwith all but 196 objects. Two days earlier, Spain had withdrawn fromthe League of Nations, following Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.   At the request of the Geneva authorities, the new Spanish regimeagreed to leave temporarily behind 175 paintings and 21 tapestriesto be shown at an exhibition that made Geneva, ``the culturalcapital of Europe,'' as an enthusiastic comment in the local pressput it.   The exhibition that ran for exactly three months became thebiggest art event of which Switzerland was ever host. More than400,000 visitors, including ex-King Alfonso XIII of Spain and theDuke and Duchess of Windsor, admired the exhibits in Geneva's Artand History Museum. The net profit, 350,000 Swiss francs, equivalentto about 1,750,000 francs today or $1 million, went to Spain.   The exhibition closed Aug. 31, at 10:30 p.m. Seven hours and 10minutes later, Adolf Hitler announced that German troops had invadedPoland, marking the outbreak of World War II.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, July 21-23</NOTE></DOC>
