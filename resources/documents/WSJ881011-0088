The University of Texas at Austin and Oxford University Press announced plans to publish the Oxford Law Dictionary, which will trace the evolution of legal language in English from its earliest known uses in the 16th century.    Research is expected to take more than six years and keep eight full-time staff members busy at the newly established University of Texas/Oxford Center for Legal Lexicography in Austin.    The Oxford Law Dictionary will compete in a market dominated by Black's Law Dictionary, first published in 1891, long the standard reference work in the field.    According to Bryan A. Garner, who will serve as editor in chief, the Oxford Law Dictionary takes a broader historical approach than its competitors. Entries will include quotations from each historical period demonstrating how the use of the word evolved over the years. In addition, words such as &quot;law review&quot; that don't appear in any dictionary but are nonetheless part of a lawyer's jargon will be included, said Mr. Garner.    Many law librarians say that there is room for another law dictionary. &quot;Items we expect to be in Black's are sometimes nowhere to be found,&quot; said Margaret Davenport, a law librarian at the New York law firm Cahill Gordon andamp; Reindel. &quot;Black's is a good book, but it needs improvement. Oxford could move in.&quot;    &quot;Black's is recognized world-wide as the leading dictionary for law, and we will compete aggressively. It's too early to say what the market for the Oxford dictionary as a competitor to Black's will be,&quot; said a spokesman for Minneapolis-based West Publishing Co., publisher of Black's.    Oxford's new law dictionary will be the first historical dictionary published by Oxford University Press outside the United Kingdom.    Mr. Garner will also serve as director of the center for legal lexicography and as a visiting law professor at the University of Texas. Last year Oxford University Press published Mr. Garner's Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage. </TEXT></DOC>
