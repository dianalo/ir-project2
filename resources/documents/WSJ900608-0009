As usual, the do-gooders seem to have done moregood for themselves than for the general public.   Last year's &quot;reform&quot; of congressional ethics turned out tobe a back-door pay raise for members of Congress.</LP><TEXT>   The &quot;reform&quot; of franked mail regulations was heralded ascurtailing the free mailings that have given incumbents analmost insurmountable advantage over challengers. But in theHouse the cost of such mailings has practically doubled --from the $41 million budgeted for this year to an estimated$79 million.   No wonder Congress loves &quot;reform.&quot;   And no wonder the public is unenthusiastic about thecampaign-reform legislation gathering steam in the Senate.   The measures being negotiated behind closed doors areanother example of incumbent self-perpetuation disguised asstatesmanship. The evils to be vanquished are &quot;unlimitedspending,&quot; according to the Democrats, and &quot;specialinterests,&quot; according to the Republicans.   But the Democrats really want full public financing ofcampaigns and even greater perks and security for incumbents.(Most incumbents are Democrats.) The Republicans really wantto block the Democrats without appearing to be against&quot;reform.&quot; So the enterprise boils down not to the Democratsvs. the Republicans, but to the Incumbents vs. theChallengers -- the Imperial Congress vs. the Voters.   Campaigns cost too much, say the Democrats. In speechesintroducing their bill, they bemoaned &quot;the money chase {that}has corrupted the political process of this country&quot; and &quot;theescalating arms race of fund-raising that is destroying thesystem.&quot; Their prescription: public funding and overallcampaign spending limits.   Democrats stress the spending limits are voluntary, butapparently no one will volunteer without the lure ofsubstantial government benefits: low-cost television time,subsidized campaign mail (there they go again), and publicmoney to match money spent by independent groups and&quot;excessive&quot; spending by an opponent.   To collect all these goodies, the incumbent merely has topromise not to spend more than a certain limit. But if thechallenger, swimming upstream against the powerful current ofincumbent advantage, spends more than the limit, theincumbent gets millions more in public money, and thespending limit is removed.   Republicans oppose spending limits. The centerpiece oftheir &quot;reform&quot; proposal is the abolition of political actioncommittees. PACs, so it is argued, are &quot;special interests&quot;that dominate campaigns and give more to incumbents thanchallengers.   The Democrats recently jumped on the &quot;Kill PACs&quot;bandwagon, and the good-government forces are now shiftinginto bipartisan high gear.   Initial posturing is completed. Partisan positions arestaked out. Bipartisan negotiations are under way. Now,observe the next step in this typical dance: In the comingweeks a bipartisan compromise is likely to emerge, and therewill be much back-patting among the reformers -- Democratsand Republicans alike. If scientists measure the hot aircoming from the Senate wing of the Capitol, they'll probablyidentify it as a critical source of global warming.   The truth is, there always have been &quot;special interests&quot;in American politics, and there should be. People get intopolitics because they are interested in something, mad aboutsomething, or want to get something done. If teachers, oilworkers or accountants have a beef with Washington and wantto band together to support or oppose a candidate forCongress -- what's wrong with that?   Nothing. It's one of the animating principles of ourConstitution. Madison explains in &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;that a multiplicity of &quot;interests&quot; are fundamental torepublican government. De Tocqueville observed: &quot;As soon asseveral inhabitants of the United States have taken up anopinion or feeling they wish to promote . . . and as soon asthey have found one another out, they combine. From thatmoment they are no longer isolated men, but a power seen fromafar, whose . . . language is listened to.&quot; Perhaps themoralists and would-be reformers of today should reflect uponDe Tocqueville's conclusion that the banding together ofcitizens to promote these &quot;special interests&quot; enhanced bothindividual rights and the common good.   PACs make &quot;special interest&quot; money both public andaccountable. The alternative, at least in the past, was thatspecial interests exerted influence behind closed doors. ReadRobert Caro's latest book on President Johnson: During the1948 Senate campaign, Johnson aides took $50,000 cashdonations from oil tycoons in paper bags, he claims.   In the last campaign, PAC money for all Senate racesconstituted an estimated 23% of campaign money, vs. 64% fromindividuals. And, like PACs, individuals also gave more toincumbents than they did to challengers. Eliminating PACsmakes no more sense than eliminating individualcontributions.   Most important, eliminating PACs probably would beunconstitutional. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court leftno doubt that campaign contributions and expenditures areprotected as a form of expression by the First Amendment. AndPACs, as voluntary associations of free citizens seekinglawful political aims, are protected by the Constitution aswell.   Also in dubious constitutional standing are the provisionsin the Democratic bill that guarantee that public revenueswill be used to match &quot;excessive&quot; spending by an opponent orby PACs or other independent groups. What does it do to theprotected political expression of a challenger who, as hespends more money -- as he must necessarily do -- to take ona powerful incumbent, has his expression effectivelynullified by an ever larger public subsidy flowing to theincumbent?   Granting reduced TV broadcast rates and mail costs tocandidates using public money, while denying them to thoseusing private money, is also likely to run afoul of the FirstAmendment. The American Civil Liberties Union calls this&quot;effort to micromanage the content of political speech . . .wholly inappropriate and unconstitutional,&quot; declaring:&quot;Surely, there is no justification for allowing a publiclybenefitted candidate to pay only 25% of the price of afirst-class stamp, while a privately financed candidate paysfull rate.&quot;   Incumbents claim they're forced to spend too much timechasing campaign money, at the expense of their jobs inCongress. If that is true, why is last year's average forroll-call-vote attendance 94% in the House and 98% in theSenate? How do members find the time to act on billsdesignating &quot;National Tap Dance Day&quot; or &quot;National Juke BoxWeek&quot;?   Then there is the claim that campaigns are too expensive.Put it in perspective: $459 million was spent in the lastelection on all House and Senate campaigns. That's less thanthe amount spent to advertise just snacks and soft drinks onnetwork TV: $492.8 million. In 1988, each of 52 Americancompanies spent more on advertising alone than the combinedcost of all the campaigns for the U.S. Senate that year.   What's really wrong is not campaign finance -- it's whatgoes on in Congress itself. To truly limit the power ofincumbents, bring fresh blood and competition intocongressional races, and correct some related abuses inCongress, we should:   1. Limit terms. The career Congress, with its 98%incumbent re-election rate in the House and 85% in theSenate, breeds cynicism, now at epidemic proportions.   We have strayed far from the Founders' idea oflandholders, merchants, farmers, and those in the variousprofessions coming to represent their fellow citizens for atime in the national legislature. We have forgotten that, ina civic sense, returning home is as important as coming toWashington in the first place.   Limiting representatives to six terms and senators to twoseems reasonable.   2. End free mail. The franking privilege gives incumbentsa huge advantage over challengers. Reforms, controls, andlimits haven't worked.   In fiscal 1989, one Republican senator mailed 12.1 millionpieces with a price-tag of $2.7 million. A Democraticcolleague sent out 10.3 million items at a cost of $1.7million. He fired out one million pieces of mail in the firstquarter of fiscal 1990.   In 1988, the latest year for which figures have beendisclosed, members of both houses mailed 805 millionnewsletters and other franked mail -- more than seven piecesfor every household in America -- at a postal cost of $113.4million, according to the estimates of the House clerk.   3. Cut congressional spending. The money Congress spendsjust on itself is outrageous. It took Congress 191 years toreach an annual budget of $1 billion in 1980. Just 10 yearslater, it had climbed to $2 billion. With reduced budgets,fewer staffers and fewer perks, incumbents could performtheir duties and have less idle time and fewer resources towaste.   4. Shorten the campaign season. Members of Congress shouldvolunteer to defer fund-raising until 12 months before anygiven election. Think how it would free them to devote theirattention to important legislation]   5. Insist on openness. Full disclosure of all campaigncontributions is the best accountability imaginable. Citizenswould have the freedom and power to band together andcontribute to candidates. Voters would know everything andcould make their decisions accordingly.   Pundits and politicians profess to be concerned about thegrowing cynicism of American voters. But the campaign reformsbefore the Senate are exactly the kind of legislation thatfosters such cynicism from Portland to Pueblo to Peoria.   ---   Sen. Armstrong (R., Colo.) has announced he will not seeka third term when his current one expires this year.</TEXT></DOC>
