The election marked the first time that an established party challenged the ruling Nationalists, or Kuomintang, known as the KMT. While the newly organized Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, is illegal under current law, the government didn't act to prevent its candidates from running for election.    Those candidates won 12 of 73 seats up for grabs in the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's lawmaking council. The DPP's showing represented an impressive comeback for the tangwai, or political opposition, which won only six seats in the previous legislative election, in 1983.    The DPP also gained in the National Assembly, which has little function but to rubber-stamp the election of Taiwan's president every six years. The party won 11 seats out of 84, up from the three to five it had held.    But the gains are a mixed blessing for the tangwai, analysts said. Coming just after President Chiang Ching-kuo announced plans to lift the 37-year-old imposition of martial law and the ban on new political parties, the DPP's performance may intensify KMT hard-liners' concerns about stability and security, some analysts said.    &quot;The KMT has been in power for too long to know how to react to a serious challenger,&quot; said C.L. Chiou, a visiting scholar from the University of Queensland, Australia, who specializes in Taiwan politics. &quot;The party has always had feelings of insecurity, and the worry is it might respond to a threat by tightening its grip.&quot;    But other analysts said the opposition's strong showing could force the ruling party to acknowledge political changes here and hasten the pace for making democratic reforms. These analysts said the conservatives' setbacks in this election could help quiet them.    The defeat of one candidate, Chen Hung-chuan, was particularly stunning because it was the first loss ever by a candidate sponsored by the army. Mr. Chen's defeat &quot;shows that voters now have their own ideas,&quot; said Alexander Lu, a political-science lecturer at National Taiwan University.    &quot;The president has told the world that there will be more democracy. He can't go back on his word. But the question is how much and how soon?&quot; asked Mr. Lu.    Among the elements affecting Taiwan's democratic future is whether the DPP can live up to voters' expectations of a serious rival party. The prospects for that were improved with the impressive comeback of the veteran opposition leader Kang Ninghsiang, whose defeat in 1983 dealt a blow to the tangwai's growth. Mr. Kang, a moderate, was elected to represent the city of Taipei -- the most important constituency in the country -- and received one of the highest vote counts among all candidates.    Mr. Kang said privately after the announcement of his victory that &quot;the election finally removes the doubt in people's minds that I am the leader and that the moderate force I represent is being recognized.&quot; Mr. Lu, the National Taiwan University lecturer, said that &quot;Mr. Kang's victory will give him the power base to consolidate the opposition party and guide it to maturity.&quot;    The election also revealed that those who ran as independents suffered disastrous results. Mr. Lu said that indicates that the DPP is capable of attracting voters as a party and, by extension, that party politics is growing here.    Official figures aren't available yet, but tallying by the Independence Evening Post, a national daily newspaper, said the DPP garnered 22% of the votes, compared with 16.8% for opposition candidates in 1983. The KMT's portion decreased to 70% from 73%. The remaining votes went to independent candidates.    Legislative reform will be a major issue when the new lawmakers take office in mid-February. Because Saturday's election involved only 23% of the 322-member Legislative Yuan and 9% of the National Assembly, the DPP's showing won't tilt the balance of power. But the gain suggests that the ruling party can expect to yield some influence if it decides to open more legislative seats as Taiwan inches toward democratization.    Age and death are taking their toll on the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan, with most seats in both bodies held by elderly KMT representatives elected in China in 1947. The membership of the National Assembly has shrunk to 972, at the latest count, from 2,961 in 1947, and the average age of these assemblymen is 75. The Legislative Yuan's membership has dropped to 322 from 760, with an average age of about 70.    The question of filling those vacant seats raises the issue of how representatives of mainland provinces can be elected in Taiwan to perpetuate Taipei's claim of sovereignty over mainland China. Another thorny question is how many of those mainlanders' seats should be replaced by Taiwanese, who represent 85% of the population here. </TEXT></DOC>
