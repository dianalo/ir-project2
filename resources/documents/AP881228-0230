The Federal Home Loan Bank Board sold American, the nation'ssecond-biggest thrift, to the Robert M. Bass group of Fort Worth,Texas, for $350 million cash.   The investment group promised to inject at least $150 millionmore into the insolvent thrift over the next three years. And thebank board agreed to supply up to $1.7 billion in federal aid fromthe industry-financed insurance fund, the Federal Savings andamp; LoanInsurance Corp.   The new institution, with a federal charter, is called AmericanSavings Bank.   American, insolvent and burdened with debt blamed on overlyaggressive expansion and risky real-estate loans and directinvestments, was seized by the bank board in September from its oldowner, Financial Corp. of America.   The board kept the bank open through tortuous negotiations withBass, running 186 branches in California, and has tried to retaincustomers by guaranteeing deposits even beyond the normal $100,000FSLIC insurance limit.   One facet of the agreement represents a setback of sorts for theBass group, which had sought permission to put up to 10 percent ofAmerican's assets into a so-called merchant bank which could fundcorporate takeovers.   That plan drew fire from state regulators, elected officials andthrift executives who maintained that it was American's aggressivemanagement that got the company into trouble in the first place.   The merchant bank idea has been replaced, the bank board said,with permission to put up to 3 percent of the company's assets in asubsidiary called Stockton Capital Corp. that will be allowed to buyor invest in profitable companies.   Apparently in return for concessions from Bass on the merchantbank, the bank board reduced the amount of cash the investor groupmust initially pump into American to $350 million from $550 million.   The new institution is run by Mario Antoci, formerlysecond-in-command at H.F. Ahmanson, the nation's biggest thriftholding company and one generally described by analysts asconservative and well-run.   Antoci, 54, was named chairman and chief executive officer of NewAmerican Holdings Inc., the new, Bass-controlled holding company forthe thrift.   His appointment was greeted in the industry as a signal Bassintends to run American along traditional thrift lines, focusing onhome mortgages.   ``He's a good, conservative banker,'' said an approving WilliamCallender, president and chief executive officer of CaliforniaFederal Savings andamp; Loan Association.   ``It appears to send a signal to the market that the institutionis going to be run in a conservative and traditional fashion,''added Bob Adelizzi, president of San Diego-based Home FederalSavings andamp; Loan. ``I think that bodes well for (American's) futurehealth.''   The rescue plan outlined Wednesday by the government and the Bassgroup splits American into two institutions:   A so-called ``good bank,'' called American Savings Bank, will runthe branches and oversee the loans and investments that continue tomake money. A ``bad bank,'' called New West Federal Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, was formed specifically to sell off foreclosed loans,unprofitable real estate investments and other bad assets.   The ``good bank'' will have assets of $15.7 billion, making itthe sixth-largest Sandamp;L in the country. With $30.1 billion in assets,the old American was the nation's second-biggest thrift., behindAhmanson's Home Savings of America.   The old holding company, Financial Corp. of America, is beingliquidated in bankruptcy court, and trustee David Gill has said itis likely stockholders in FCA will lose their entire investments.   Headquarters for the new holding company remain in Irvine and thesavings and loan will continue to be run out of Stockton.</TEXT></DOC>
