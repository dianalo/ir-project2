President Joaquin Balaguer met with representatives of the farmers Wednesday night in the National Palace and agreed to pay them $285,000 of the approximately $570,000 they have coming.    The rest of the money will be paid next month, said an accord signed by representatives of the government, the peasants and the Roman Catholic Church, which has served as a mediator.    The government has bought land near the town of Cotui, 80 miles north of the capital Santo Domingo, to make way for a partially built dam. Most of the land will be flooded when the project is finished.    President Balaguer also agreed to try to speed up the relocation of the 124 families forced from their homes by the dam.    One man died and several people were injured in demonstrations this week in which protesters detonated homemade bombs and blocked roads with tree trunks. Dozens were rounded up by police, and many were reportedly beaten and jailed.    In February, five people died during a weeklong protest by peasants in the same region demanding payment for their lands and protesting the contamination of water from byproducts of the state-owned Rosario gold mine. </TEXT></DOC>
