(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two PTL aides convicted of tax evasionharbored no bitterness over ministry founder Jim Bakker's decisionnot to testify in their defense, their attorney says.   Brothers David and James Taggart were convicted Tuesday ofevading $525,000 in income taxes on $1.2 million they took from thetelevision ministry to buy condominiums, furs, jewelry and nearly$100,000 worth of shoes.   Bakker invoked his Fifth Amendment right againstself-incrimination last week when the defense called him to thestand. Bakker and former PTL Executive Vice President RichardDortch are scheduled to go on trial Aug. 28 on wire and mail fraudand conspiracy charges.   ``Obviously we would have preferred it if he testified,'' saiddefense attorney Ben Cotten.   He said his clients were not bitter at their former boss.   ``They recognized he followed his constitutional rights, justlike we have,'' Cotten said. ``He's going to face some of the samethings we faced in this trial.''   Federal prosecutor David Brown said he would recommend a stiffsentence. Each Taggart faces a maximum of 25 years in prison andmore than $1 million in fines. A tentative sentencing date was setfor Aug. 25.   ``Greed doesn't pay. No matter how rich you are, you've got topay your taxes,'' Brown said.   A U.S. District Court jury found David Taggart, 32, and his35-year-old brother, James, guilty on identical charges: conspiracyto impede the IRS in collecting income taxes and filing false taxreturns for the years 1984 through 1987.   Brown said the verdict was not a statement about PTL, thetelevangelism empire started by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker in theearly 1970s. The ministry was well known for the Bakkers' tearful,televised pleas for money.   ``It was a statement about David Taggart and James Taggart'sobligations to pay their taxes no matter how much they own and whatkind of lifestyle they live,'' he said.   The Taggarts joined PTL in 1978 as piano players. By 1980, Davidwas Bakker's top personal aide. James became the interior designerat PTL's Heritage USA Christian retreat just south of Charlotte.   Both Taggarts were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at PTL inearly 1987 following Bakker's resignation.   The Taggarts were charged with tax evasion after they allegedlyspent nearly $1.2 million in PTL money on personal luxuries such ascondominiums _ including one at Trump Tower in New York City,jewelry and designer clothes.   Cotten said the money was approved by Bakker.   Brown said the Taggarts used their credit cards to make thepurchases and over four years took out about $750,000 in cash fromPTL to pay off the bills.   The Taggarts declined to comment following the verdict.   Cotten still maintained his clients were innocent.   ``They were innocent going in and they are innocent comingout,'' he said.   A woman who answered the telephone at the Bakkers' home inOrlando, Fla., said there would be no comment from the Bakkers. Shedeclined to give her name.   Bakker and Dortch were indicted Dec. 5 on charges they divertedmore than $4 million to support lavish lifestyles. If convicted onall charges, each man could be sentenced to more than 120 years inprison and fined more than $5 million.   Bakker quit PTL in March 1987 in a sex and money scandal broughton by his confession of a sexual liaison with former churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.</TEXT></DOC>
