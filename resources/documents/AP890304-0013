Mrs. Dole said the raise to $4.25 must also be coupled with asub-minimum ``training wage'' for the first six months employmentfor all newly hired workers. And she would expand the currentexemption from the minimum to all small businesses.   The Bush plan puts the administration at odds with Sen. Edward M.Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and Human ResourcesCommittee, and his bill to gradually raise the minimum to $4.65 anhour.   There are slightly fewer than 4 million people working for theminimum wage, according to the Labor Department.   The $3.35 floor has not been raised since 1981. Since then, saidKennedy, inflation has cut the purchasing power of that wage by 40percent.   The Labor committee will begin considering the minimum next week,and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says he would like tobring it to a vote by the full Senate by the end of the month.   But Mrs. Dole's veto warning on Friday _ what Kennedy termed a``take it or leave it'' _ set the stage for a battle like the onelast year when Kennedy's increase failed because of opposition bythe Reagan administration.   Mrs. Dole told the Labor panel that any rise in the minimum wagewill cost the nation jobs and that Kennedy's plan would mean 650,000jobs lost. She said the administration's increase of 30 cents a yearfor three years would balance lost jobs with higher earning powerfor low-income workers.   ``Any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptable,because it would decrease job opportunities,'' she told thecommittee.   ``Legislation outside those parameters would call for a veto,''she said.   Kennedy told Mrs. Dole that if a veto threat is part of theadministration's proposal ``then we're laying right out for aconfrontation ... I hope we're not getting a take or leave it.''   Mrs. Dole answered, ``The president has signed up for $4.25 anhour, and not higher.''   ``$4.25 is it,'' she said, waving her hand.   Under the ``training wage,'' all workers hired at the minimumcould be paid $3.35 an hour for six months before they are coveredby the higher standard, whether or not it is their first job. Thereare no limits such as age on that exemption.   The administration would also expand the tax credit for tips fromthe current 40 percent to 50 percent.   Kennedy, noting cost-of-living increases for government workers,those in the military and others, said ``those at the end of theeconomy ought to get it, too.''   The administration proposal was attacked by the businesscommunity after the committee hearing.   ``A higher minimum wage would deny access to the first rung onAmerica's job ladder or those entering the work force _ the verypeople the increase is meant to help,'' said Robert L. Martin,director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's employee relations policycenter.</TEXT></DOC>
