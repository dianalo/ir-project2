(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man with a pistol fatally shot a womanFriday across the street from a school kindergarten pupils outsidefor recess, then wounded two police officers before he was captured.   Police said the suspect, identified as Dee Eastman, 25, had beena high school classmate of the victim and had harassed her in thepast, but the motive was unclear. None of the children was injured.   The shootings began shortly after noon in front of the LafayetteSchool, when the suspect crashed his car head-on into a car drivenby the victim, according to police radio reports.   A witness, Richard Beckner, said he heard the crash and lookedout the window of the plumbing shop where he works and saw thewoman's car spinning down the road.   ``I saw a man carrying a handgun, walking fast toward the car,''Beckner said. ``He put the gun inside the driver's window and shotthree times.''   Jennifer Mesenbring, 25, of nearby Bourbonnais, suffered threegunshot wounds and was pronounced dead a short time later at St.Mary's Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Diane Pellak. A secondyoung woman in the car escaped injury.   ``She said to us that her friend, the driver, told her, `Oh, myGod, he's got a gun!','' Beckner said. ``So she rolled out of thecar and underneath.''   The man fled, stole a pickup truck and headed toward a woodedarea along the Kankakee River. Police followed and a shootoutensued, in which one officer was hit in the shoulder and the otherin the abdomen.   Officer Jeff Hackley of the police department in nearby Bradleywas in critical condition at St. Mary's with a gunshot wound to thepelvic area, and Officer Larry Osenga of the Kankakee PoliceDepartment was in fair condition with a shoulder wound, saidhospital spokesman Dennis Yohnka.   Eastman, also of Bourbonnais, was taken into custody and chargedwith murder.   Sgt. Bill Stark of the Bourbonnais Police Department said thesuspect has had previous run-ins with authorities and last monthkicked and dented a car Miss Mesenbring was driving.   She told police at the time that Eastman had been harassing herand that she had tried to avoid him.   Lafayette Principal Avis Huff said 16 kindergarteners and theirteacher, Bonnie Gall, were in a playground across the street fromthe crash scene.   ``The teacher heard the noise, and when she heard breaking glassshe took immediate precautions like for a tornado,'' said Mrs. Huff.   Ms. Gall ``told them to take action, cover their head and fallto the ground, and then to move out,'' said Mrs. Huff.   They were rushed inside the school and the doors were locked.</TEXT></DOC>
