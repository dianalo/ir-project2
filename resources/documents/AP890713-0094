The eruption happened at 6:30 p.m. about 1{ miles northeast ofthe island of Teishijima, the Central Meteorological Agency reported.   The island is just off the coast of Ito city on the Izupeninsula, 60 miles southwest of Tokyo. The extent of the volcanicactivity several hundred yards beneath the ocean's surface was notimmediately known, the agency said.   There were no immediate reports of injuries, and a tsunami, orseismic wave caused by earthquakes or volcanic activity, was notexpected, the agency said. However, it issued a navigation warningto ships operating in the area.   Many people in Ito, a seaside spa known for its many hot springs,were seen leaving their homes, but no evacuation order was issued,the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said. Hundreds of people called localofficials asking about the volcano.   ``Right now, we don't know if this will lead to another, largereruption and can only tell people there to watch for furtherwarnings,'' said a Central Meteorological Agency official whorequested anonymity. ``Obviously, there could be danger to Ito if alarger eruption occurs.''   More than 20,000 earthquakes have been recorded around Izu overthe past two weeks, and officials from the Construction Ministry'sGeographical Survey Institute began today to check movement of theearth's crust at Ito, the town nearest the epicenter. Ito has apopulation of 72,000.   Also seismologists from the University of Tokyo started surveyingthe movements of underground magma with monitoring equipment in Ito.   The stepped-up investigations followed an emergency meeting lateWednesday of the government's Coordinating Committee for EarthquakePrediction, which called for ``careful monitoring'' of thecontinuing earthquakes.   The 16-member committee, led by Professor Daisuke Shimozuru ofthe University of Tokyo, said in a statement that the successiveminor quakes occurring since Tuesday night ``may be caused byactivities of underground magma, and there is a need to monitor themcarefully.''   Two million people visited Ito last year, where there are 450inns and hotels for visitors, Hidekatsu Takei, acting director ofthe Hot Spring Tourist Cooperatives in Ito, told The AssociatedPress.</TEXT></DOC>
