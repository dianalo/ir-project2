But it's for collegeadministrators, not students.   After surviving two student sit-ins in three years,officials at the Burlington campus figure they've earneddoctorates in bullhorn negotiation. So, as part of a two-dayconference on legal issues in higher education, collegeadministrators from across the nation will be schooled by theuniversity on how to avoid -- or defuse -- studentdemonstrations.</LP><TEXT>   The conference was announced only three weeks ago, but theuniversity has already received a &quot;flood of calls&quot; about the$250 seminar from interested colleges, says Edward Twardy,director of Continuing Education and the conferencecoordinator. &quot;I think we've hit the right topic.&quot;   Ironically, UVM students are wondering if theiradministrators somehow missed the whole point of the pastdemonstrations, which centered on making UVM a &quot;diversityuniversity&quot; in curriculum, student body and faculty.   &quot;I don't know why we should focus so much on trying toappease everyone,&quot; says Bruce Vrooman, UVM student-bodypresident. &quot;Takeovers are provocative. They often provideinsight that the administration lacks. Trying to avoidtakeovers and sit-ins is destructive.&quot;   The seminar won't teach educators how to storm barricadesor toss tear gas. &quot;This is not necessarily just a war-storything. The point is to talk to lay administrators aboutfreedom of speech and what our Constitution permits people todo and not to do,&quot; explains Mr. Twardy. &quot;I think it'simportant that university administrators have a plan. We canoften anticipate and take actions {such as dialogue} thatmake violent demonstrations unnecessary.&quot; The seminar willalso address such topics as hate speech vs. free speech,affirmative action and substance abuse.   In the UVM takeover last April, about 20 studentsbarricaded themselves in the president's office for threeweeks while demanding that the promises made in the 1988student takeover -- for a more culturally diverse curriculum,faculty and student body -- be fulfilled. The protesters wereeventually arrested, but a committee formed of students,faculty, staff and trustees is now addressing the issues.   While students aren't invited to the seminar, Mr. Vroomansays he wants to attend because &quot;they shouldn't try to make auniversity a quiet resting place.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
