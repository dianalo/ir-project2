And so, at the request of Mr. Jelinek, and others whosympathize, the Marin County Board of Supervisors this weekunanimously approved a plan ordering a $6,000 study examining&quot;self-esteem and non-animal versus animal research.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The study will be part of an environmental impact reviewfor a proposed $27 million center for research on aging. Insubmitting their original proposal, promoters of the centersaid it would boost the &quot;status, self-esteem and quality oflife of older individuals.&quot; As part of its work, the centerplans to conduct research on rats, mice, flies, slugs andworms.   But many people in fashionable Marin County don't approveof animal research, says Mr. Jelinek, and &quot;this is not goingto help their self-esteem.&quot; The cost of the study, he argues,is like a &quot;drop of vermouth in a dry martini . . . a verysmall part&quot; of the total $622,000 review. Opponents of theBuck Center for Research in Aging also say the project mayharm the environment and is a waste of money.   In requesting the study, Mr. Jelinek wrote that &quot;the stateof California recognizes the importance of self-esteem to thehealth, senses and intellect of its citizens,&quot; and hesuggested a look at &quot;the long-term effects on self-esteemthis project will have, compared to the effects onself-esteem that would be caused by a facility notexperimenting on sentient creatures.&quot;   This made sense to the Marin County Planning Department,which decided that &quot;the fact that the Buck Center has statedan objective of the project is to enhance quality of life andcommunity self-esteem, makes this environmental issuenecessary&quot; for review.   Funding for the study comes from a trust set up by BerylBuck, a Marin resident who died in 1975, leaving $15.4million to benefit Marin, one of the nation's wealthiestcounties. The trust, much of which was in oil shares thatskyrocketed in value during a takeover, now stands at $502million.   For the study, people who already live near facilitiesthat conduct rodent research will be asked how this hasaffected their self-esteem. &quot;I think they'll just laugh,&quot;says Mary McEachron, director of the Buck Center. &quot;This isloony tunes.&quot;   She should be grateful. No has one yet requested a studyof whether such research affects the self-esteem of rats.</TEXT></DOC>
