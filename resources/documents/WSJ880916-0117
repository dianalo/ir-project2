However, the book is not closed on exactly what happened in this election, and no one's sure what Mexico's political landscape will look like when the dust from all the commotion settles.    Candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas's socialist coalition -- currently overshadowed by its point man, the newest and loudest member of the Mexican senate, Porfirio Munoz Ledo -- scored big in the election and may continue to press its assertion of victory. The conservative National Action Party (PAN), on the other hand, emerges from the election almost as shaken as the government. Half of the PAN leaders seem to favor continuing joint protests with the &quot;Cardenistas,&quot; while the other half argue that Mexico's biggest threat is from the leftists, not the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Depending on the outcome, the PRI's 1988 electoral strategy will go down as either a stroke of genius or a giant miscalculation.    The official returns approved on Saturday give Mr. Salinas just over 50% of the vote, Mr. Cardenas 31% and the PAN's Manuel Clouthier 17%. Despite the continuing charges of fraud, this is a far closer result than the PRI has ever admitted to before. Results from local elections proved even more surprising. The PAN secured important congressional and local victories in the north, but it was the leftist National Democratic Front that stole the show. Besides winning even more congressional seats than the PAN, Mr. Cardenas's Front won four of the country's 64 senate seats -- two from his home state of Michoacan and two from Mexico City. Never before had the PRI acknowledged an opposition victory in the senate.    Furthermore, the degree of freedom granted to this growing minority in congress is extraordinary. Raucous shouting matches are daily occurrences on the floor of the usually staid Mexican congress, including an unprecedented barrage during President Miguel de la Madrid's annual &quot;state of the nation&quot; address.    Nevertheless, this new aura of political openness invariably clashes with the not-so-old way of &quot;doing business.&quot; Debate over election results continues. Most of the congressional shouting matches have concerned the opposition's desire to inspect ballot boxes brought in from around the country and housed in basement rooms just below the congress floor. Armed guards still prevent opposition congressmen from entering the rooms where the boxes are stored.    But it's not just the opposition members who question the results. &quot;The other day I was talking to Fidel Velasquez,&quot; says a former government official, referring to the aging labor leader on whom the PRI relies for union support. &quot;He said that the middle class and above voted for Clouthier and those below the middle class voted for Cardenas. I asked Don Fidel who voted for Mr. Salinas, and he said: 'The computer.'&quot; This particular PRI member (no friend of Mr. Cardenas) asserts that when government poll watchers saw the leftist-front candidate winning, a five-day &quot;computer breakdown&quot; was orchestrated to obscure wholesale tampering with the ballots.    Irregularities led many PAN officials to form alliances with their ideological opposites from the leftist Front. Monterrey engineer and PAN candidate Juan Celada, who won a state congressional seat in Nuevo Leon, says leftist poll watchers were key in his victory. Says Mr. Celada:   &quot;If I had protested the illegal acts at the voting booths myself, the election board would merely have said 'it's the PRI's word against yours.'&quot; But when the PAN's figures were confirmed by leftist poll watchers, the election board accepted the results and declared Mr. Celada the winner.    To solidify this relationship nationally, Rogelio Sada, a successful Monterrey businessman who lost his job two years ago for participating in the campaign of a local PAN candidate, helped found ADESE, the Democratic Assembly for Effective Suffrage. ADESE's 14-member executive committee includes top officials of the PAN, Mr. Munoz Ledo and other members of the leftist coalition and intellectuals of differing ideological bents, such as Enrique Krauze and Carlos Monsivais. Mr. Sada wants to annul the election, form a 1 1/2-year interim government and hold a new election. &quot;I think Munoz Ledo and other members of the Front are really concerned about the illegalities of this election,&quot; says Mr. Sada. &quot;We can work together on this issue, even if we disagree on all others.&quot;    If Mr. Sada is not skeptical of the motives of Mr. Munoz Ledo, other members of the PAN are. They point to Saturday's confirmation vote at which only the 85 PAN representatives voted outright to reject the official figures. The 136 members of the leftist coalition walked out of the chamber rather than vote for or against the election results. This led some to speculate that while making a lot of noise about electoral fraud, the leftists were quite pleased to be allowed as many seats as they were.    In fact, several informal polls organized by journalist Sergio Sarmiento monitored results posted outside key voting booths in Mexico City on July 6. Mr. Munoz Ledo, according to these polls, actually may have lost the senate seat to his PAN opponent. If this is true, why would the PRI give the bothersome Mr. Munoz Ledo a senate seat he did not win? One top official of the PRI, who asked not to be identified, suggested an answer: &quot;It's better to have your enemies on the inside where you can watch them carefully.&quot;    Some go further and suggest that the Front was created by the PRI. Former PAN deputy Jose Angel Concheo explains why. &quot;Clearly, the entrance of Cardenas in this election badly split the protest vote against the PRI,&quot; says Mr. Concheo. &quot;If Mr. Cardenas had not been running, the PAN probably would have won. In this sense, the PRI's plan to create the leftist opposition was brilliant.&quot; There was just one problem, Mr. Concheo adds: &quot;Like Dr. Frankenstein, they created a monster which they now cannot control.&quot;    Nevertheless, after acknowledging the strength of the left in this election (and seeing the PAN cut down to size in the process), the PRI may well be ready to acknowledge some PAN victories in the north. Monterrey cookie manufacturer Alberto Santos, who just ended a three-year term in congress for the PRI, says that the PRI cannot reverse the opening process begun by Mr. de la Madrid. &quot;In this presidential term, you will see at least two gubernatorial races going to the opposition,&quot; predicts Mr. Santos.    Political columnist Adrian Lajous does not believe the Front will stand in the way of the government's plans. &quot;The power of the resistance is dying down,&quot; he says. &quot;Front rallies are drawing fewer participants, and the PRI is finding more ways to strike deals with the Front and the PAN.&quot; And there are historical precedents for assuming that things will quiet down. Says Mr. Lajous: &quot;Twice since the revolution, opposition candidates who claimed they were cheated out of victory eventually came back to accept the results. In the end, so will Mr. Cardenas.&quot;    ---   Mr. Asman is editor of the Journal's Americas column. </TEXT></DOC>
