The case involves a lesbian's right to seek joint custody of a child conceived through artificial insemination.    The former partner of a lesbian mother claims that her role in the child's conception and her financial support entitles her to participate in the child's upbringing. The case is significant, said Nathan Goldberg, an attorney for the plaintiff, &quot;because so many lesbian couples are now becoming parents.&quot; There is no law &quot;that talks about the rights of lesbian parents,&quot; he added.    Mr. Goldberg and another Los Angeles attorney, Gloria Allred, base their case on a theory they call &quot;parenthood by estoppel.&quot; Explained Mr. Goldberg, &quot;The theory is that there are certain things a person can do to be the legal equivalent of a parent.&quot;    In her 1988 suit against the mother in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Terri Sabol claims that she assisted in the insemination process, paid pregnancy expenses, and supported the mother and child through October 1988. A relative of Ms. Sabol donated the sperm.    A baby girl was born in 1986 and the couple split up about two years later. Ms. Sabol alleges that the mother, Susan Bowling, who had earlier agreed to visitation rights, began restricting Ms. Sabol's time with the child in October 1988.    Defense attorney Glen Schwartz, of Los Angeles, said that because Ms. Sabol is neither the biological nor the adoptive parent, she will have a tough time proving her case. &quot;The basic question here is, what is a parent?&quot; said Mr. Schwartz. &quot;Are we going to create another group of people who can be adjudged to be a parent? At what point does a person become a parent? We need definitions. There must be legislative action to do this.&quot;    ---   MYERSON andamp; KUHN recruits former Federal Trade Commission chairman. Daniel Oliver, chairman of the FTC from April 1986 until August 1989, has become a partner in the New York law firm of Myerson andamp; Kuhn.    The firm, founded in January 1988 after the breakup of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson andamp; Casey, has lost eight equity partners in the past few months, said name partner Harvey Myerson. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. fired the firm in April after a billing dispute.    Mr. Oliver, 50, said that he had looked into the problems and that his concerns had been alleviated. He will head the trade regulatory practice at the 120-lawyer firm and divide his time between the Washington and New York offices.    Mr. Myerson said, &quot;In light of the battering we have taken in the press, I'm proud that people like Dan Oliver believe in us.&quot;    ---   BASKIN, FLAHERTY, Elliott, Mannino, Gordon andamp; Scully's Washington office splits.    Two name partners and seven associates of the Philadelphia-based firm have joined forces with the Washington firm of Metzger, Alprin, Jones andamp; Burk to form 20-lawyer Metzger, Gordon andamp; Scully. Partner Stuart J. Gordon declined to comment on the split except to call it &quot;amicable.&quot; But lawyers familiar with the breakup said the Washington office wasn't getting much business from Baskin, Flaherty's Pittsburgh and Philadelphia offices and that Washington lawyers felt they were sacrificing too much of the revenue they generated to the firm's other offices.    Henry F. Siedzikowski, managing partner of Baskin Flaherty's Philadelphia office, said the Washington practice wasn't meshing with Baskin Flaherty's other offices and that it wasn't profitable.    Mr. Siedzikowski said the firm had been considering closing its Washington office when the split occurred. @ ---    UNIVERSITY HIRES collection agency to get judges to pay overdue bill.    Pan American University in Edinburg, Texas, recently hired the agency to recover a $9,000 debt it had been trying to collect for nearly 19 months.    The money is allegedly owed by the Southwest Texas County Judges Association, whose 29 members sponsored the debate of six Democratic presidential candidates at Pan American Dec. 15, 1987. The school says the association agreed to pick up the tab for use of its facilities. That bill, totaling $9,133.35, went out less than two months after the debate. &quot;We've been trying to collect ever since,&quot; says Bruce Erickson, a spokesman for the university.    The results so far? Payments from two county judges; several letters from judges who said they didn't know what Pan American was talking about; and a letter from an Austin attorney representing the association &quot;basically telling us to take a leap,&quot; says Mr. Erickson.    The attorney, Randall Wood, acknowledges saying something along those lines when he wrote the letter last June 30, two weeks before Pan American brought in the collection agency. Mr. Wood says several of the judges had expressed bewilderment over the bill, and it &quot;looked a little weird&quot; coming so long after the debate.    Mr. Wood says subsequent correspondence convinces him Pan American did have some sort of understanding that it would be paid, although he believes the agreement wasn't communicated very well and he doesn't think the judges are legally bound by it.    Even so, barring some subsequent development, the attorney says he'll probably advise them to &quot;pay their shares.&quot;    ---   BURNS'S RECRUITING SPREE: Arnold Burns, the former Justice Department official who heads the Washington office of Proskauer Rose Goetz andamp; Mendelsohn, continues to bring new blood to the New York law firm. Since Mr. Burns joined the firm a year ago, Proskauer's Washington office has doubled in size to a dozen lawyers. The latest entries are two litigation partners, Warren Dennis and Christopher Wolf. Both lawyers were recruited by Mr. Burns from the Washington office of Philadelphia's Ballard, Spahr, Andrews andamp; Ingersoll and specialize in lender liability litigation. </TEXT></DOC>
