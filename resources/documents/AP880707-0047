Neither the Federal Electoral Commission nor any of the partieshad released any results when Jorge de la Vega Dominguez, presidentof the Institutional Revolutionary Party, announced ``a crushing,legal and incontestable victory'' for Carlos Salinas de Gortarishortly after 1:30 a.m. The party has ruled Mexico since 1929.   Moments after the victory claim, Interior Secretary ManuelBartlett went on national television to reject allegations of votefraud.   A few hours earlier, the three leading opposition presidentialcandidates met with federal officials and issued a statementaccusing the government of rigging the election.   One witness to the voting Wednesday said she saw an 8-year-oldboy cast a ballot. People were also seen voting for their wholefamilies and election workers were said to be stuffing ballot boxes.   ``The election day that just ended represented a civic awakeningof the Mexican people'' that the government has quashed by riggingthe vote, the opposition candidates said.   The statement accuses the government of stuffing ballot boxes,eliminating citizens from voting rolls, paying people to vote andmultiple voting.   It says the irregularities ``seriously affect the cleanliness oftoday's balloting'' and ``could annul the results unless theproblems are satisfactorily resolved.''   Rosario Ibarra de Piedra of the radical Revolutionary WorkersParty read the statement, as fellow candidates Cuauhtemoc Cardenasof the leftist National Democratic Front and Manuel J. Clouthier ofthe conservative National Action Party stood by.   Most polls closed at 6 p.m. (8 p.m. EDT) Wednesday and theelection commission had said partial returns would be availablefour hours later.   By early today, however, no results or turnout had been releasedand officials said computer trouble was to blame.   The election Wednesday was not only for president. Voters alsoelected a new 500-member Chamber of Deputies and a 64-member Senate.   Opposition parties were expected to gain in the congress, whichover the last few years has begun to shed its image of being arubberstamp to the executive.   Since its founding 1929, Mexico's governing party, known as thePRI, has won every presidential election and has controlled thenational congress and the governorships of all 31 states.   But this year, a clear deterioration of the PRI's influence wasevidenced by the strong campaigns waged by Cardenas and Clouthier.   In 1982, President Miguel de la Madrid won 70 percent of thevote. This year, the victory margin was not expected to be as widefor Salinas de Gortari.   De la Madrid's six-year term expires Dec. 1 and under theconstitution he cannot be re-elected.   Fraud was reportedly widespread in Salinas de Gortari's adoptedhome town of Agualeguas, about 80 miles north of Monterrey near theU.S. border.   Petra Hernandez, a report an 8-year-old boy who voted withhis father's voting card.   She said election officials ``let a lot of people vote for thewhole family. They voted for their wife, their kids, their mom whocouldn't come.''   ``The president of one precinct also was filling out ballots. Isaw him get up nine times and put ballots in the boxes,'' she said.   PRI officials denied the reports of fraud in Agualeguas.   The campaign has not been without bloodshed.   Gunmen on Saturday killed Francisco Xavier Ovando, a long-timeCardenas collaborator and strategistion but to Ovando's tenure as Michoacanattorney general.During that time, Ovando fought organized crime.   But Cardenas called the slayings ``a provocation.''   In recent months, Clouthier's conservative National Action Partyand Cardenas' left-leaning National Democratic Front coalition haveweakened the PRI's popular support.   For the first time, nearly the entire left unified behind onecandidate, the 54-year-old Cardenas. Late in the campaign, MexicanSocialist Party candidate Heberto Castillo left the race and threwCardenas his support.   Only Mrs. Piedra's party declined to join.   Clouthier, a wealthy 54-year-old rancher and businessman, ran ona free-enteed support among a middle class whose aspirations havebeen dashed by the country's 6-year economic crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
