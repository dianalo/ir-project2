In its report yesterday on last October's market crash, the SEC noted &quot;several instances of firms trading in futures ahead of customer futures and stock programs&quot; on Oct. 20. These cases &quot;raise significant concerns,&quot; it says. Similarly, the presidential task force known as the Brady commission raised questions about front-running in its report last month.    Some big investors worry that front-running raises fairness questions and could affect market volatility. The U.S. market is &quot;a national treasure,&quot; says Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus Corp., a big mutual-fund firm. He fears that active professionals may be affecting the marketplace for their own profit. Mr. Stein was a member of the Brady commission.    In its report, the SEC staff sought to determine if providers of a hedging strategy known as &quot;portfolio insurance&quot; traded ahead of customer orders on Oct. 16, 19 and 20. They found the practice wasn't general or large-scale. But they identified seven proprietary sales of futures contracts on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, or about 7% of the total trades, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange during the last hour of trading Oct. 16 &quot;at prices higher than substantial customer orders&quot; executed shortly afterward. They found similar anomalies during the first hour of trading on Oct. 19 and Oct. 20.    The SEC also tried to identify firms trading in futures ahead of customer stock transactions. It found that 13 firms sold 771 Sandamp;P futures, or 4% of CME volume, between 9:30 and 10 a.m. Oct. 19 before most stocks in the index had opened. The same 13 firms actively bought futures on Oct. 20. On both days, two or three major firms accounted for well over half the proprietary trades.    The SEC says this wasn't &quot;classic front-running.&quot; Customer orders aside, it says, there were many indications the market would fall on Oct. 19 and rise on Oct. 20. But the SEC says such proprietary trading contributed to customers receiving executions at inferior prices.    The Brady report also cited possible front-running Oct. 20, the day after the crash. It said big securities firms may have bought stock-index futures in anticipation that stock and futures prices would rise because of an impending flood of stock buy-backs announced that afternoon by Citicorp, ITT Corp., USX Corp. and others.    Front-running needn't only propel stock prices higher. Around the time of the crash, Wall Street traders say, several big securities firms -- having been contacted by nail-biting clients who wanted to unload billions of dollars of stock as the market started to fall apart -- engaged for their own accounts in heavy selling of futures in U.S. markets and of stocks in Europe. Thus, professional selling perhaps exacerbated the pre-crash and Oct. 19 slide of stock prices.    In another instance last November, many traders noted aggressive buying of cyclical chemical stocks. The suspicion was that brokers were acquiring, then marking up, the prices of stocks ordered by pension-fund clients.    Chrysler Corp. in November bought several hundred million dollars of stocks and futures -- which later were replaced with stocks. Frederick Zuckerman, treasurer, says he has never found evidence of front-running by brokers, although he worries about the potential for abuse. In fast-moving markets, Mr. Zuckerman says, &quot;one has to have a certain tolerance for execution.&quot;    The trouble is, front-running is hard to pin down. Who's to say that brokers buying futures on Oct. 20 weren't just betting on a rebound? Similarly, brokers selling stocks in Europe last October may wisely have been hedging risky stock positions their clients were asking them to take on, says Jeffrey Miller, a principal of Miller Tabak Hirsch andamp; Co., a New York securities firm.    Nicholas Katzenbach, former U.S. attorney general, says it's probably impossible to prove front-running without combing through brokers' internal trading records, which would require a government subpoena. In a study of the crash for the New York Stock Exchange last December, he was the first investigator to draw public attention to investors' concerns about front-running.    The Big Board has a rule against unfair trading practices, including front-running. But it hasn't been able to stretch its regulatory grip to futures markets. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it's considering a rule spelling out its policies relating to front-running.    For the record, major securities firms aren't saying much about the front-running issue. They don't want to get into a fighting match, says a spokesman for one big investment bank. </TEXT></DOC>
