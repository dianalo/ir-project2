His warning came at a Cabinet meeting, according to a statementby Information Minister Ali al-Shaer that was distributed by theofficial Saudi Press Agency.   Mahdi Karrubi, the radical speaker of Iran's parliament, onMonday reiterated his call for retribution against Saudi Arabia forlast week's beheading of 16 Kuwati Shiite Moslems convicted ofplanting bombs in the holy city of Mecca.   The July 10 bombings came at the height of the Moslem pilgrimageseason in Mecca, killing one pilgrim and wounding 16.   The doomed Kuwaitis said in a recorded confession broadcast lastweek on Saudi television that they received sabotage training fromIranians in a remote area of Kuwait. They said two Iranians at theIranian Embassy in Kuwait provided them with explosives and timingdevices.   Iran denied it.   On Monday, Fahd said, ``The kingdom will not retreat as much asa hair's breadth from exacting Hodood (God's punishment) ... onwhoever tries to tamper with the sanctity of the Islam's holiestshrines or tries to undermine security in the country.   ``We will accept no blame in our quest to uphold justice. Wewill not heed the false propaganda campaigns,'' he said, referringto anti-Saudi pronouncements from Iran.   Saudi Arabia is governed by Sharia, Koranic law that prescribesbeheading for convicted murderers, saboteurs and whoever desecratesholy shrines. The punishments are known as Hodood, which alsosentences adulterers to death by stoning and thieves to having ahand cut off.   Saudi authorities said the bombs in Mecca were planted by agroup identified as Kuwaiti nationals, most of them of Iranianextraction. Sixteen were executed in Mecca on Thursday, foursentenced to jail and nine acquitted.   Al-Shaer quoted Fahd as noting that executive authorities do notinfluence the Islamic courts, which handed down the deathsentences, but ``is limited to carrying out'' such sentences.   In Iran, Karrubi said Saudi Arabia must expect ``vengeance'' forbeheading the 16. In Kuwait, groups of Shiites tried to demonstratein front of the Saudi Embassy but were dispersed by police.   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, said that in a statementreleased Monday, Karrubi said a mourning ceremony will be heldThursday for the ``Kuwaiti martyrs'' at the shrine of the lateAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on the outskirts of Tehran.   He told the Iranian Parliament on Monday that ``revolutionaryMoslems will deliver the appropriate response for this crime,'' theradio said.   The executions have become a cause celebre for Iranian radicalswho oppose normal ties between Tehran and Riyadh.   Iranian pragmatists, led by the newly elected President HashemiRafsanjani, had been moving to ease a Tehran-Riyadh rift datingfrom July 1987 when more than 400 pilgrims, most of them Iranians,were killed in clashes with Saudi security forces in Mecca.</TEXT></DOC>
