Accordingly, comments at the meetings and written comments bymail are invited from the public, from Federal, State and local agenciesthat have an interest in APHIS or related programs, and from Federal andState agencies that have either jurisdiction by law or special expertiseregarding any national program issue or environmental impact that shouldbe discussed in the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Meeting Procedures</ITAG>Public meetings are a continuing part of the environmental impact statementprocess. An APHIS representative will preside at the meetings, where commentswill be heard concerning any issue that would be relevant for the finalEIS. Interested persons may appear and be heard in person, by attorney,or other representative. Each meeting will begin at 9:00 a.m. and end at4:00 p.m. local time; however, a meeting may end earlier if all registeredpersons have been heard. Persons who wish to speak should register at thedesk located at the meeting entrance. Pre-meeting registration will beconducted at each meeting location from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. on the meetingdate. Registered persons will be heard in the order of registration; unregisteredpersons who wish to speak will be afforded the opportunity after the registeredpersons have been heard. Since the time for each speaker may be limited,speakers are encouraged to submit written comments and to summarize thesecomments at the public meetings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The boll weevil was introduced to the United States in 1892 near Brownsville,Texas. From that point of introduction the weevil spread quickly, and by1922 it had completely infested a 15-State region known since as the BollWeevil Belt. This area involves nearly 11 million acres of cotton.As the boll weevil spread eastward and westward from its point of origin,it caused more damage than any other cotton pest. It is currently the mostimportant agricultural pest in the United States, responsible for morethan $300 million in annual losses and control costs for cotton. The damagecaused by the boll weevil and other pests has been estimated to be 7 to20 percent of the U.S. cotton crop.In infested areas, economic losses are traditionally prevented only byintensive use of chemicals by cotton growers. Frequently, these chemicalsmust be applied repeatedly during the growing season to control weevilsand any resulting secondary pests. Within the proposed program area, theboll weevil may be the indirect cause of much of the damage caused by thebollworm, the tobacco budworm, and spider mites, because insecticides usedto control the boll weevil destroy many of the natural enemies of thesespecies. This, in turn, often results in higher crop losses and even moreintensive use of insecticides to protect the crop from these pests. Thisboll weevil cycle results in very few options for growers using pest managementcontrol strategies against other pests.APHIS initiated a Boll Weevil Eradication Trial in North Carolina and Virginiaduring 1978 through 1982. That trial demonstrated that the boll weevilcan be eradicated, and further, that the eradication of the boll weevilcan also increase the value of land not previously planted for cotton production.Using county acreage figures, a regression model, and adjusting for otherfactors, cotton acreage increased from 50 to 60 percent due to the BollWeevil Eradication Trial.The success of this trial program on nearly 40,000 acres resulted in programexpansion to other cotton producing areas. A significant benefit of theprogram is the decline in cotton insecticide application for the eradicationzone following the program. The decline in pesticide usage was estimatedto be 55 percent. In the buffer zone, private insect control expendituresalso declined by about 14 percent.APHIS has cooperated in three major boll weevil control programs: Southeast,Texas High Plains, and Southwest. In the majority of these programs, APHIShas provided technical advice, and has participated only in the collectionand distribution of survey and monitoring information. In the Southeastprogram, however, APHIS has been responsible for managing and supervisingthe entire program in four States: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and SouthCarolina. Because of the success of the trial program and of the threecooperative programs, and the desire to instill greater uniformity in nationalefforts to control the boll weevil, APHIS has examined ways to implementa coordinated national program that coverts the entire Boll Weevil Belt.The scope of this program, and the multi-year nature of the endeavor, resultin the need to prepare a comprehensive EIS for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives</ITAG>The following program alternatives were identified for the National BollWeevil Control Program and discussed in the DEIS: (1) No action, (2) beltwideeradication of the boll weevil (preferred alternative), and (3) beltwidesuppression of the boll weevil.Control method alternatives identified and discussed in the DEIS include:(1) Cultural control, (2) mechanical control, (3) sterile insect technique,(4) chemical control, and (5) biological control.<ITAG tagnum="84">Major Issues</ITAG>Following are some of the major issues discussed in the DEIS:(1) Impacts of the alternatives on the biological environment, includingtarget and nontarget species;(2) Impacts of the alternatives on the physical environment, includingsoil, water quality, and air quality; and(3) Impacts of the alternatives on other aspects of the human environment,such as wilderness areas, domestic animals, recreation, public health andsafety, the cultural environment, public attitudes, energy, and the economy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preparation of Final EIS</ITAG>APHIS will consider all comments in the development of the final EIS forthe National Boll Weevil Cooperative Control Program. Following the 60-daycomment period, a final EIS will be prepared. A ``Notice of Availability''of the final EIS will be published in a subsequent <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 27th day of July 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
