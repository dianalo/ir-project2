<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0975 </DOCNO><TEXT>The adhesion of CVD tungsten to Silicon Dioxide has been a difficult andpoorly understood problem. The present study looks at the adhesion issuesas they relate to equipment, processing and the condition of the substratesurface layers, (i.e., type and cleanliness). The goal of this work isto move to a quantitative description of the components of adhesion (i.e.,tungsten film adhesion strength, stress, strain, tensile strength, etc.).Bulk and interface properties as they relate to the adhesion are discussed.Types of adhesion failures of tungsten layers on oxide surfaces are described.Finally, the authors review the present methods of testing for adhesionand their limitations.</TEXT></DOC>
