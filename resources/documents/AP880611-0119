He was 89.   A founder of the Social Democratic Party and a staunchanti-communist, the former president died at his home in Rome. Athis side were his son, Giovanni, and daughter, ErnestinaSantacatterina. Saragat had been treated for a cardiovascularproblem for years.   ``The Republic loses in Giuseppe Saragat a central figure in thefight against fascism and Stalinism,'' said Premier Ciriaco DeMita, leader of the Christian Democrats.   Saragat joined the Socialist Party in 1922 and became a memberof the directorate along with Pietro Nenni. He went into exile inAustria and then France when dictator Benito Mussolini rose topower in 1926.   Years later, in 1947, he broke with the Socialist Party becausehe feared its leader, Nenni, was shifting too far to the left.   He then formed the Social Democratic Party and as secretarybuilt it into a pro-Western and anti-communist force.   ``In the name of liberty, he was a proclaimed enemy and alwaysfought against all forms of dictatorship and totalitarianism,''said Socialist Party leader Bettino Craxi, a former premier.   During his seven years as the fifth president of the Republic,beginning in 1964, Saragat worked for reforms in housing, medicalcare, education and taxation. He also presided over a period ofeconomic prosperity.   When he left office in 1971, Italy again was beset by economicproblems and political uncertainty.   Saragat was a scholar fond of Roman philosophers and relaxedabout politics.   He once told a political leader who had waited to see him: ``Iam sorry for keeping you waiting so long, but I was engaged in atalk with (Italian poet Salvatore) Quasimodo. Poetry should comebefore politics sometimes, don't you think?''   His political life was not always tranquil. When he returned toItaly from exile in 1943 he was arrested because of hisanti-fascism and imprisoned by the Nazis. He escaped, wasrecaptured, and escaped a second time together with Sandro Pertini,who also later became president.   After the war, Saragat was ambassador to France and thenpresident of the provisional assembly in 1946 that framed the newconstitution.   Saragat was born Sept. 19, 1898, in Turin and obtained auniversity degree in economics and commerce. He worked as a bankclerk and for a newspaper and wrote political books under the penname ``Togaraso.''   He was elected to Parliament four times and served three timesas deputy premier. Saragat supported the Socialist-ChristianDemocrat alliance that governed Italy during six of his seven yearsas president.   Saragat engineered the merging of his party with the biggerSocialist Party in 1966, but when the unified party took a beatingin the 1968 elections the two again separated.   The Social Democrats are partners with the Christian Democrats,Socialists, Republicans and Liberals in the governing coalition.   Saragat is survived by his son and daughter. The funeral isscheduled for Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
