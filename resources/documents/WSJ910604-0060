The Florida SpaceportAuthority, a state agency, wants to study the July 11 solareclipse using a $115,000 sensor developed by universityresearchers, but it can't get permission from the federalgovernment to use an old launch pad near Cape Canaveral. Fourfederal agencies demanded a series of studies to provelaunching the 12-foot, 90-pound rocket wouldn't harm localwildlife or historic sites. Ed O'Connor, the authority'sdirector, says his staff &quot;counted every bug on the beach&quot; tocomply, but they still couldn't get approval in time for thelaunch. The rocket will now be sent up from a site nearMazatlan, Mexico, and the authority says commercial launcheshave a limited future in Florida. It's no wonder much newscientific research is now being conducted outside the U.S.,a nation ceding its future to bureaucrats.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
