Reagan, setting the stage for summit talks in Moscow with Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev, said he hoped to conclude a treaty to cutstrategic nuclear arsenals before his term expires in eight monthsbut acknowledged that might not be possible.   ``It is the requirements of a good treaty and not some arbitrarydeadline that will determine the timetable,'' Reagan said.   Reagan made his remarks in an address beamed across Europe todayon the United States Information Agency's ``Worldnet'' satelliteservice. The speech was taped Monday in the Oval Office.   The president will leave Washington on Wednesday, bound forHelsinki, Finland, and a four-night stopover before traveling on tothe Soviet Union. He will arrive in Moscow on Sunday andimmediately launch his fourth summit with Gorbachev.   Reagan said talks with the Soviet Union must be guided byrealism about what can be achieved.   ``We do not expect a quick, radical transformation of the Sovietsystem,'' the president said. ``We do not expect to turn a cornerone day to find that all our problems have gone away because ouradversary has been transformed.   ``We must continue to fulfill our own responsibility to standfirm and vigilant, to provide the incentive for a new Soviet policyin contrast to the old,'' Reagan said.   ``For there still remain profound political and moraldifferences between the Soviet system and our own,'' he added.   Reagan and Gorbachev will have five official meetings, wrappingup their talks June 1. Later that same day, the two leaders andtheir wives will attend a special ballet peformance at the BolshoiTheater and then dine at Gorbachev's dacha, or country home,outside Moscow.   Aside from his talks with Gorbachev, Reagan also will meet withmonks, dissidents, writers, artists, filmmakers and students,lending encouragement to reforms underway in the Soviet Union andexpressing hope for more change.   ``In Moscow, I will welcome the progress we've seen in the humanrights record, especially since the end of 1986,'' Reagan said. Hesaid more than 300 political and religious prisoners have beenreleased from labor camps.   ``Emigration, still too low, has improved,'' he said.   ``Many cases of divided families and separated spouses have beensatisfactorily resolved. And censorship of films, books and othercreative works has eased,'' Reagan said.   ``Yet despite this progress, the human rights situation in theSoviet Union and Eastern Europe is far from good,'' the presidentsaid. ``Repressive policies persist.   ``Peaceful demonstrations by national minorities, refuseniks andothers are still being broken up by police,'' he added. ``Freedomof religion is still being denied, and members of unregisteredreligious groups are still being persecuted.   He also said unofficial publications are banned, dozens ofpolitical and religious dissenters remain imprisioned and ``manyprisoners of conscience are still being held in psychiatrichospitals. Freedom of movement is still restricted.''   Reagan said the United States ``will continue to press theSoviet Union to improve its practices in these vital areas _ inshort to grant full recognition of fundamental human rights.''</TEXT></DOC>
