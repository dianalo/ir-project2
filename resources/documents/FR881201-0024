Background </ITAG>A brief background of the Act and the history of the Sacramento SIP isprovided here. For a more comprehensive description of the relevant requirementsof the Act and EPA's regulatory actions on the Sacramento SIP, see theproposed disapproval of the SIP for Sacramento and four other areas inCalifornia (52 FR 26431, July 14, 1987) and the General Preamble accompanyingthat notice (52 FR 26404). The Clean Air Act mandates a system of state implementation plans as thechief mechanism for meeting the NAAQS. Section 110(a)(1) directs the stateto submit, within nine months from the promulgation of primary NAAQS, aplan for implementing those NAAQSs. Section 110 lays out the requirementsthat the plan must meet and provides a mechanism for revision of the planwhere the Administrator finds that the plan is substantially inadequateto achieve the NAAQS by the relevant deadline. Recognizing that numerous areas had not been able to attain the NAAQS withinthe initial timeframe, Congress added Part D to the Act in 1977. Part Dallowed certain ``nonattainment'' areas to extend the time for attainmentto December 31, 1982, with the exception that certain areas, in which itwas ``not possible'' to meet that deadline for ozone and carbon monoxide(CO) despite the application of all reasonably available control measures,could apply for a further extension to December 31, 1987. California requested, and EPA approved, an extension of the statutory attainmentdate for ozone in the Sacramento AQMA to December 31, 1987. The State thensubmitted 1982 plan updates for the California ozone SIP for Sacramentoand several other areas. In 1983, EPA proposed to disapprove these revisionsand impose a construction ban on the ground that the plan did not providefor attainment of the ozone standard by the end of 1987, or reasonablefurther progress in the interim. 48 FR 5074 (February 3, 1983). On July30, 1984, EPA took final action to approve the control measures submittedby the State, but held open the question of whether to approve the attainmentdemonstration in the SIP submittal for Sacramento and for three other areasof California (South Coast, Fresno, and Ventura) similarly lacking approvableSIP attainment demonstrations for ozone or carbon monoxide. 49 FR 30300,30305 (July 30, 1984). In July 1987, EPA reproposed to disapprove the ozone SIP for Sacramento,South Coast, Fresno, Ventura and several other areas. 52 FR 26408-26409,26431-26435 (July 14, 1987). In that notice, EPA stated that it lackedauthority to continue to defer action on the plans for those areas thathad not yet submitted a plan demonstrating attainment by the deadline,and that it had no choice but to disapprove the plans for those areas andimpose a construction ban under section 110(a)(2)(I). In November 1987, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinionin <T3>Abramowitz v. United States Environmental Protection Agency</T3>, 832F.2d 1071 (9th Cir. 1987). The court held that EPA lacked authority todefer action on whether the South Coast ozone and carbon monoxide planmeets all of the Part D requirements of the Act when the Agency approvedthe individual control measures. The court ordered EPA to ``disapprovethe relevant SIP provisions.'' 832 F.2d at 1079. Pursuant to the NinthCircuit Court's instructions, EPA took final action in January 1988 todisapprove the South Coast SIP. 53 FR 1780 (January 22, 1988). EPA alsotook final action in September 1988 to disapprove Ventura County's ozoneSIP. 53 FR 39087 (September 28, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Discussion </ITAG>EPA concludes that the attainment demonstration deficiency in the Sacramentoozone SIP is substantially identical to the deficiencies in the South CoastCO and ozone SIP and the Ventura ozone SIP, and EPA is therefore now takingfinal action to disapprove the Sacramento ozone SIP. The ground for EPA'sfinal disapproval of the Sacramento SIP is that it does not demonstrateattainment of the ozone NAAQS by December 31, 1987, or by any other fixeddate (near-term or otherwise) thereafter. Under the terms of the Act andEPA's regulations, such final plan disapproval results in the impositionof a construction ban in the Sacramento AQMA for major new sources andmajor modifications of existing sources of VOC.\1\<NOTE/> Section 110(a)(2)(I); 49 CFR 52.24(a). Under 40 CFR 52.24(f)(4)(ii) and (f)(5)(i), a major stationary source or major modificationthat is major for VOC is also major for ozone. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Sacramento Air Quality Maintenance Area includes allof Sacramento and Yolo Counties and portions of Placer and Solano Counties.Within this area, any major new source or major modification for whichthe construction permit application is incomplete on or after January 3,1989 will be prohibited from construction. EPA's criteria for determiningan application to be complete are explained in 52 FR 26404 and 26409 n.18(July 14, 1987).Today's action is also driven by the reasoning of the decision in <T3>Abramowitz</T3>. That decision establishes that EPA has no discretionunder the law to postpone the final disapproval when the Agency has effectivelydetermined that the plan does not provide for timely attainment. Thus,EPA is not responding directly to public comments on EPA's July 14, 1987proposal. EPA may respond to some of the comments in the future, perhapsin connection with EPA's final policy on how areas like Sacramento shouldcorrect their SIPs after December 31, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Final Action  </ITAG>EPA is today taking final action to disapprove the 1982 Sacramento AQMASIP revision for attainment of the primary NAAQS for zone. Pursuant tothe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), this disapproval iseffective January 3, 1989. The effective date for the construction banis January 3, 1989.  Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not ``Major.'' It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review.  Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA must assessthe impact of proposed or final rules on small entities. EPA does not havesufficient information to determine the impacts that the construction moratoriumannounced in today's notice may have on small entities, because it is difficultto obtain reliable information on future plans for business growth. Evenif this action were to have a significant impact, however, the Agency couldnot modify its action. Under the Act, the imposition of a constructionmoratorium is mandatory whenever the Agency determines that an implementationplan for a nonattainment area fails to meet the requirements of Part Dof the Act, and that determination, in turn, is effectively required bythe Ninth Circuit's decision in <T3>Abramowitz.</T3>  Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial reviewof this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals forthe appropriate circuit by January 30, 1989. This action may not be challengedlater in proceedings to enforce its requirements. <T3>See </T3>section 307(b)(2).  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52  </ITAG>Air pollution control, Ozone, Intergovernmental relations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 28, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
