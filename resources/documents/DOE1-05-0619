The extraction and processing ofradiating materials in reservations or nearby makes the American Indiansliving on the Colorado plateau in the southwest, in the State of Washingtonor in the surroundings of the Black Hills suffer a lot. Oekozid extrareports on the injuries, the protest and dying of the victims, the radioactivedevastation of the landscape, the cynical practice of the responsiblepolitical organs and the complicity of the Federal Republic of Germany.The author appeals for a new consciousness as regards to the dimensionof human action and the knowledge of the fact that any anti-nuclear power/plutoniumpolicy has to include putting a stop to uranium extraction and uraniumprocessing. Warnings and admonitions the traditional Indians have beengiving since 1948, have been ignored so far.</TEXT></DOC>
