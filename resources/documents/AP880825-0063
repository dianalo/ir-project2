(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL's bankruptcy trustee says he'llshorten the time the ministry has to sell its assets when hesubmits a revised reorganization plan to a bankruptcy judge whorejected his first proposal.   In rejecting the reorganization plan Wednesday, U.S. BankruptcyJudge Rufus Reynolds said it failed to take into account theministry's poor financial health.   ``This plan does not work,'' Reynolds said. ``It does notreflect the situation.''   He gave PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton until Oct. 1to prepare a new plan, and until Sept. 10 to return withinformation on potential buyers of the ministry's assets.   Benton said PTL's secured creditors rejected the plan because itallowed five years for the sale of the assets. PTL's majorcontributors, called lifetime partners, also rejected the plan, hesaid.   Reynolds could have approved the plan despite the negative votesfrom creditors, but decided against it.   Proceeds from the sale of assets would repay PTL's debts, whichcould top $130 million.   Reynolds rejected the idea of closing down operations, sayingthat would kill PTL's revenue sources, which include donations fromviewers of the televised ministry and proceeds from the HeritageUSA Christian retreat near Fort Mill.   The ministry, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in June 1987after the resignation of founder Jim Bakker in a sex-and-moneyscandal, has been divided into the newly named Heritage Ministriesand a corporation holding PTL's assets.   Benton said after the hearing that he would propose speeding upthe time required for the sale of assets to six to seven months.   Benton did not address the effect of the reorganization plan'srejection on potential buyers of the assets. But he said setting asale within seven months would let creditors know how much theywould be receiving much quicker than the five years allowed in theoriginal plan.   Benton told the court the debtor corporation has been losing$400,000 a month, and needed $885,000 from the sale of other assetsto survive 30 more days. Reynolds approved that request.   Benton said he expected to have by a Sept. 1 a firm offer fromCanadian Peter Thomas of the Samoth Capital Corp. to buy theHeritage USA theme park, satellite television network and otherproperty. The company has offered $113 million for the network,park and 1,700 acres of undeveloped property.   He said there also may be offers from Bakker, Charlotte, N.C.,businessman George Shinn and an Oklahoma group he declined toidentify.</TEXT></DOC>
