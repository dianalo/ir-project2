Nestled among the four &quot;TGIF&quot;comedies on ABC's Friday night lineup, it collected a huge pile of badreviews, but not many fans who couldn't face life without it.;    At first,&quot;Baby Talk&quot; seemed a surefire hit. It was under the care of Ed. Weinberger,one of TV's most successful writer-producers, whose hits date back to &quot;TheMary Tyler Moore Show.&quot; It also starred Connie Sellecca, a well-known TV starfrom ABC's popular &quot;Hotel&quot; drama series. And it was based on one of 1989'sbiggest hit movies, &quot;Look Who's Talking.&quot;;    But trouble nipped at its heelsfrom the start.;    First, Columbia, the studio behind it, decided not to callit &quot;Look Who's Talking.&quot; They feared it would confuse people to have a TVseries by that name while &quot;Look Who's Talking, Too,&quot; the movie sequel theybrought out last summer, was still playing in theaters.;    So they blew theadvantages of having a &quot;pre-sold&quot; title.;    Then, just before &quot;Baby Talk&quot; wasdue to go into production, Sellecca left. It was, the network said, a mutualdecision. Nobody wanted Sellecca playing the unwed mom of a baby who &quot;thinks&quot;with the voice of Tony Danza, including Sellecca.;    Without a new star tostand in for Sellecca, Weinberger couldn't deliver the show on time, and ABChad to remove it from the fall lineup.;    Then, when Weinberger hired former&quot;Newhart&quot; star Julia Duffy to take over the role, all the scripts had to berevised. Sellecca is tall, dark and dramatic and Duffy is short, blond andcomedic.;    Nor was it helpful that Duffy soon learned to hate her role. Oncethe reviews came in and a critics' poll named it worst show of the season, shewanted to crawl into the baby's cradle and pull its blanket over her head. Shewanted out, out, out.;    Normally, that's where my story would end. &quot;BabyTalk&quot; was getting bad reviews, slightly better than mediocre ratings and wasabout to lose its star for the second time. Nothing about it was working.Everything pointed to cancellation.;    So, guess what? Come Friday, Sept. 20,at 9:30 p.m., &quot;Baby Talk&quot; will have its season premiere. If we're lucky, noneof us will recognize it.;    Gone are Weinberger, Duffy and everybody else inthe cast except Paul and Ryan Jessup, the twin babies who share the role oflittle Mikey. (Danza returns as the baby's voice.) The setting will shift toan apartment building in Brooklyn Heights and the story won't stop so often tolet us &quot;hear&quot; Mikey's thoughts.;    Mary Page Keller, who last season played asingle mother on ABC's &quot;Life Goes On,&quot; will take over the role of Mikey's mom,Maggie, and Scott Baio (&quot;Happy Days,&quot; &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot;) will play her newboyfriend, James, a young musician/composer who lives next door.;    For allpractical purposes, it's a completely new show, but with two leads who moreclosely resemble the stars of the original movie: Kirstie Alley and JohnTravolta.;    That's fine with new producers Bernie Orenstein and SaulTurteltaub (&quot;Kate andamp; Allie,&quot; &quot;Sanford andamp; Son&quot;), who didn't care for the showlast season. Neither did Baio, for that matter. Keller, mercifully, never sawit.;    So why is something called &quot;Baby Talk&quot; coming back? My best guess isit avoided disaster by having a concept ABC still had faith in and so-soratings, mostly due to the protected time slot it had behind three consecutivehits.;    The new producers hope to take better advantage of that sameprotected time slot by concentrating more on the budding romance betweenMaggie and James, less on the wisecracks from the baby's brain.;    &quot;We foundthat the characters in the last version of the show were not very realistic,&quot;said Turteltaub at a recent meeting with the press to discuss the show'soverhaul.;    Turteltaub and Orenstein didn't like the idea of two workmenpractically living round the clock in Maggie's house, nor her constantlyleaving her baby with those two clowns while she went out.;    Instead, theywant the new &quot;Baby Talk&quot; to be more like the movie, with Maggie searching fora father for her child and gradually realizing the guy next door is her idealchoice.;    Though some viewers may be surprised to find the same baby livingin a new apartment with a new, dark-haired mom this fall, so far there's noplan for any on-screen explanation of why Maggie looks like a differentperson.;    &quot;We thought of a lot of ways to do it,&quot; said Orenstein, &quot;likeopening with Mary Page Keller just taking the bandages off and saying: 'I hopeI haven't changed much.' I don't know what we'll do. I don't think Americareally cares.&quot;;    That may be the one part they've got right so far.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ron Miller column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910802  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  891  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 2, 199100215153,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
