The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 18.67 points to close at 2092.64, dropping below the 2100 level for the first time in three weeks. Broader market indexes also fell, with Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index closing 2.70 points lower at 267.85 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropping 1.40 points to 151.62.    There were 442 Big Board issues advancing, 1,039 declining and 481 unchanged.    Volume remained relatively light as many investors awaited clues to the economy's future. About 161.7 million shares were traded on the Big Board, including about 17 million shares traded in three high-yield issues to capture their dividends. Traders said many investors weren't buying until they had a chance to hear what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says today. Mr. Greenspan is expected to give some indication of Fed policy on interest rates in his testimony before Congress. Many analysts believe the Fed will move to tighten credit soon.    Investors were also apprehensive at the approach of Friday's report on the May trade deficit, which many analysts are saying will be disappointing.    The market spent the morning drifting at lower levels until the upward creep of the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index sparked a sell-off of stock-index futures, and an accompanying surge of program selling in the cash market.    But Alan R. Ackerman, senior vice president of Gruntal andamp; Co., doesn't believe the drop below 2100 in the industrial average is significant. Many traders had seen that level as a floor from which to resume the summer rally.    &quot;The upward tilt of the market is likely to continue as long as the Fed remains accommodative,&quot; he said, adding that he doesn't believe the discount rate will go above 6%.    &quot;A sell-off is always cause for concern,&quot; said Mr. Ackerman, &quot;but unlike the one of many months ago, sell-offs now are bringing bargain hunters back into the market.&quot;    &quot;The concern with inflation based on the drought is overblown,&quot; he said, adding that investors are also overreacting to interest rate fears.    &quot;Anxiety over higher interest rates and Friday's trade figures is keeping players on the sidelines,&quot; he said, &quot;but they are overshadowing stability in the dollar.&quot;    The dollar has remained firm, and Mr. Ackerman believes continued stability in the U.S. currency will temper the tone of inflation -- and eventually bring both U.S. and foreign investors back into the market.    &quot;As the dollar goes,&quot; he said, &quot;so goes the Dow.&quot;    A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, said the focus for the week will continue to be the trade numbers coming out Friday, which he expects to be higher than current estimates.    &quot;The consensus calls for an $11 billion to $12 billion trade deficit in May, but I think the number will be above consensus by about $1 billion, around $12.5 billion,&quot; he said.    Mr. Moore said that the market is tired, with too many short-term investors looking for further gains.    &quot;We need more negative sentiment&quot; before the market has room to spring forward, he said. With the potential for disappointment over the trade report Friday, Mr. Moore believes cautious investors are right to stay clear of the market this week.    The outlook later in the summer continues to be good because of the large cash positions that remain in the hands of institutional players, he said. Mr. Moore also said the dividend yields of stocks continue to compare favorably with corporate bond yields, despite the upward pressure of interest rates.    &quot;Stocks may be prepared to shrug off pressure from interest rates because their yields are still relatively high,&quot; he said.    Mr. Moore said today's drop in the market doesn't indicate any overall trend. &quot;A pullback is ordinary and expected. The break below the 2100 level in the Dow Jones industrials is not terribly significant for the long or intermediate term,&quot; he said. &quot;The market can easily recoup to the 2150 level.&quot; Nor does the slide mean there won't be further gains in the weeks ahead, Mr. Moore said.    Justin Mamis, technical analyst at Cowen andamp; Co., is more pessimistic. He told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that the stock market is headed for an &quot;intermediate correction,&quot; with a break below 1920 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    &quot;I'm expecting a correction extensive enough in time and depth to feel it was a good idea to sell,&quot; Mr. Mamis said, adding that the market is likely to see a decline of a &quot;couple hundred points.&quot;    Mr. Mamis said he based his evaluation on a number of technical indicators pointing to weakness in the market, including the deterioration in the number of new calendar-year highs among stocks on both the New York Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter markets. In a newsletter recently mailed to clients he warned: &quot;Stocks should be sold.&quot;    Polaroid jumped 1 1/2 to 31 1/4. The company, plagued by takeover rumors, announced a sweeping restructuring plan. The plan includes cutting the company's work force 500 to 800 people, repurchasing up to $300 million of its stock and entering the conventional consumer film business on a world-wide basis.    Knight-Ridder dropped 1 3/4 to 41 3/4. The company has agreed to buy Lockheed's Dialog Information Services unit for $353 million.    Payless Cashways fell 3/8 to 26 3/4. The company said Ward White Group dropped its request for confidential information that might have led to an acquisition offer. Payless management has already begun a $27-a-share tender offer for Payless shares in a bid to take the company private. Speculation that Ward White might make a rival bid for the company drove Payless shares up over $27 Friday.    Anacomp slipped 1 to 9 7/8 on volume of more than 2.4 million shares, after agreeing to buy Xidex for $10 a share in cash, or more than $400 million. Xidex jumped 1 3/8 to 9 on the news in over-the-counter trading.    Digital Equipment fell 3 1/8 to 109. Analysts say a number of trade publications have reported the cancellation of a company project to develop a new high-speed computer. The company declined to comment.    Sun tumbled 2 to 57 1/8. The company has offered to buy all the $87.5 million outstanding of Sun Refining andamp; Marketing's 8 1/2% debentures due 2000 for $957.50 for each $1,000 principal amount.    The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.27 to 307.31. Amex volume totaled 8,883,000 shares, up from 8,526,000 yesterday. There were 216 issues advancing, 365 declining and 280 unchanged.    Health Management Associates leapt 2 3/8 to 13 1/2 after members of its senior management, led by the company's chairman, William J. Schoen, proposed to acquire the company for $13.75 a share.    Bergen Brunswig slipped 1 1/4 to 21 1/2. An analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker advised investors to sell the stock because of uncertainty about the recapitalization plan under negotiation with the company's founders.    Alza gained 3/4 to 25 3/8. Pfizer announced that it entered a marketing pact to sell Alza's drug, nifedipine, internationally. Traders say analysts at Alex Brown andamp; Sons and Goldman Sachs have made positive comments on the stock, helping to boost its price. </TEXT></DOC>
