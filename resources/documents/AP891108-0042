A compromise reached Tuesday on a measure authorizing activitiesof the State Department and other agencies included penalties onChina that go beyond those imposed by Bush after the TiananmenSquare massacre in June.   The sanctions included suspension of risk insurance through theOverseas Private Investment Corp. for companies doing business inChina; suspension of trade assistance; a freeze on exports ofsatellites; a halt to sales of controlled munitions, includinghelicopters and parts, and crime control equipment; and an end tosale of certain nuclear material and components.   The measure harshly condemned the ``unprovoked, brutal andindiscriminate assault'' on the thousands of pro-democracydemonstrators in Beijing on June 4, noting that at least 700 peopledied and another 27 or more were executed afterward.   The bill also condemned China's efforts to conceal the truth ofwhat happened, including clandestine disposal of bodies andsuppression of news reports.   The sanctions and the verbal condemnation were included in thecompromise version of a two-year, $9.7 billion State Departmentbill, which now goes back to the full House and Senate for finalapproval.   The measure was initially opposed by the White House because ofthe sanctions, but was later accepted after Rep. Stephen Solarz,D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Asia subcommittee,agreed to make it easier for the president to waive the penalties.   In discussions with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft,Solarz said, the measure was altered to allow termination of thesanctions if the president certifies such action is ``in thenational interest.'' Scowcroft reported the president would not vetothe measure based on that provision, said Solarz.   The conferees also accepted a section that would impose criminalpenalties on any government official who enlists any foreigngovernment to carry out policies that are banned by U.S. law.   The amendment grew out of the Iran-Contra affair. It was intendedto bar use of U.S. foreign aid as leverage with countries to supportgoals the United States cannot pursue directly because of legalrestrictions.   It is aimed at situations like the use of U.S. military aid forHonduras to pressure that government to support the Contra rebelsfighting the government in Nicaragua. That provision could stillprovide a reason for Bush to veto the bill.   The overall measure includes major boosts in aid for the UnitedNations and for U.N. peacekeeping forces. They would be authorizedto receive a total of $832 million this year and $939 million nextyear, compared with $520 million last year.</TEXT></DOC>
