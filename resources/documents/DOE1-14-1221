At least three types of effect of IMF azimuthal componenton the frequency of appearance of magnetic disturbances are shown toexist. They are the effect conditioned by the Russee-McFerron mechanismand revealing in all the types of disturbances in equinox periods; theeffect of IMF modulus B/sub y/ most noticeable in the frequency of appearanceof convection disturbances with the maximum in the summer period; andthe effect of negative IMF component, B/sub y/ andless; 0, evidently existingthroughout the whole year.</TEXT></DOC>
