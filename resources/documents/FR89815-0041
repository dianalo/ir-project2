This review has identified areas in the regulations that areout of date, inconsistent within the regulation or between related regulations,susceptible to differing interpretations, and in need of other changes.In addition, the staff has identified other areas in the regulations whereminor changes are warranted. In response to these efforts, the NRC is proposingspecific amendments to the regulations in the way of minor correctionsand changes. The proposed changes are summarized here with a brief discussion.(1) Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of 10 CFR 73.40 substantively are beingmoved to appendix C to 10 CFR part 73 and combined with the plan specificationsalready there. A requirement for having a safeguards contingency plan isalso included in the specific security requirements section for each classof affected licensees. (2) The commonly used terms Category I, Category II, and Category III,as qualified, are added for reference purposes to existing definitionsin the definitions sections of 10 CFR parts 70 and 73. Category I quantity of material, if unirradiated, is equivalent to a formulaquantity; Category II quantity of material, if unirradiated, is equivalentto special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance; and CategoryIII quantity of material, if unirradiated, is equivalent to special nuclearmaterial of low strategic significance. In the current regulations, theterms are included in the regulations without category designations. However,the category designations are frequently used, particularly in internationalsafeguards, and appear in some NRC documents because they save time andspace. To avoid possible confusion, references to these shorter terms arebeing added to the definitions. (3) The definitions in 10 CFR part 70 are alphabetized without paragraphdesignation. Locating a specific term will be easier with alphabetized definitions.When new terms are added, they will be placed in the proper alphabeticalorder. Because the paragraph designations are removed, other parts of theregulations are modified to eliminate any reference to a specific numberedparagraph in the definitions section. (4) The general requirements for auditing the safeguards contingency plansand the physical security programs of Category I transportation and fuelcycle licensees are made compatible. The record retention period for results of the audits is made consistentat three years in both cases. The content and resulting action on auditedfindings is also made consistent. At this same time, the general requirementsfor auditing the safeguards contingency plans (10 CFR 73.40(b), (c) and(d)) are being moved to appendix C to 10 CFR part 73 and combined withthe plan specifications already there. A requirement for having a safeguardscontingency plan is also included in the specific security requirementssection for each class of affected licensees. (5) An inadvertently omitted provision that addresses access to vital areasat power reactors is being reinserted into the regulation. The restorationof the requirement in 10 CFR 73.55(d)(7) is being proposed to insure noerroneous views are held by licensees that the deletion of the sentencewas a ``signal'' that vital areas could be ``opened up'' to ``public sightseeingtours'' or ``open house visits'' without close licensee oversight. Thislanguage is already reflected in most licensees security plans and it wasintact in 10 CFR part 73 in 1986 (and for a number of years preceding 1986).Correcting this inadvertent omission does not signal any change in Commissionpolicy on past practices in this regard. Licensees are assigned the responsibilityfor making final vital area access decisions in accord with the past practicesand provisions under the approved security plans. (6) The remainder of the proposed changes are of a very minor nature. Adefinition for the term ``contiguous sites'' is added to 10 CFR parts 70and 73. Action dates that have passed are eliminated. Use of the outdatedterm ``industrial sabotage'' is changed to the current term ``radiologicalsabotage.'' References to parts of the regulations that have been movedor deleted are corrected. Several areas in the regulations are clarifiedwhere the wording was susceptible to differing interpretations. The notificationrequirement for changes to the safeguards contingency plan that do notdecrease the plan's effectiveness is being revised to require that theoriginal be sent to the NRC headquarters office with a copy to the regionaloffice instead of vice versa. Finally, typographical errors are corrected.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion </ITAG>The NRC has determined that this proposed regulation is the type of actiondescribed in categorical exclusion in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neitheran environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has beenprepared for this proposed regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement </ITAG>This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collectionrequirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501et seq.). Existing requirements were approved under the Office of Managementand Budget approval number 3150-0009 for part 70, approval number 3150-0132for part 72, approval number 3150-0002 for part 73, and approval number3150-0055 for part 75. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis </ITAG>With the exception of the proposed amendment to 10 CFR 73.55(d)(7), theseminor amendments impose no new restrictions or requirements, and therefore,have no significant impact. Accordingly, a regulatory analysis is not considerednecessary. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)),the Commission certifies that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendmentsbeing proposed are very minor in nature and care has been taken to ensurethat the impact on any licensee is minimal. In the matter of reportingcertain changes to the security program, the amendments merely reversewho receives the original and who receives the copy. The other changesare of an administrative nature and therefore do not alter the currentimplementation of the regulations by a licensee. <ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis </ITAG>The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not applyto this proposed rule with the possible exception of the amendment to 10CFR 73.55(d)(7). Here we are addressing the material and relevant partsof 10 CFR 50.109 to ensure that there are no particular questions raisedby the reinsertion of the inadvertently omitted language. A backfit analysisis not required for these minor amendments because they do not involveany provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).The following analysis is in support of the amendment to 10 CFR 73.55(d)(7).1. Statement of the Specific Objectives that the Proposed Backfit is Designedto Achieve The proposed amendment to 10 CFR 73.55(d)(7) would restore a sentence thathad been inadvertently dropped when the regulations were amended August4, 1986 (51 FR 27817). The restored provision would require licensees tolimit visitor access to vital areas of nuclear power plants for the purposeof general familiarization and other nonwork-related activities exceptfor good cause. 2. General Description of the Activity that Would be Required By the Licenseeor Applicant in Order to Complete the Backfit The proposed requirement was codified in 10 CFR 73.55(d)(7) until September3, 1986. Therefore most nuclear power plant licensees' current approvedsecurity plans and implementing procedures already meet the requirements.However, reinstatement of the requirement could, in concept, affect licenseeswhose security plans were or will be approved after September 3, 1986,and licensees who subsequently changed their approved security plans andimplementing procedures to relax controls on access to vital areas. Affectedlicensees potentially may be required to reinstate procedural controlsthat limit nonwork-related access to vital areas. 3. Potential Change in the Risk to the Public From the Accidental OffsiteRelease of Radioactive Material Vital areas of nuclear power plants contain equipment, systems, devicesor material, the failure, destruction, or release of which could directlyor indirectly endanger the public health and safety by exposure to radiation.Therefore, by limiting nonwork-related access to vital areas, licenseesreduce the potential risk to the public from the accidental off-site releaseof radioactive material. 4. Potential Impact on Radiological Exposure of Facility Employees By limiting nonwork-related access to vital areas of nuclear power plants,licensees also reduce the potential risk to facility employees from accidentalradiological exposure. 5. Installation and Continuing Costs Associated With the Backfit, Includingthe Cost of Facility Downtime or the Cost of Construction Delay The proposed amendment to 10 CFR 73.55(d)(7) would reinstate a proceduralrequirement that licensees limit nonwork-related access to vital areasof nuclear power plants. There are no installation or continuing costsassociated with this requirement. 6. The Potential Safety Impact of Changes in Plant or Operational ComplexityIncluding the Relationship to Proposed and Existing Regulatory Requirements.The proposed amendment to 10 CFR 73.55(d)(7) does not alter the plant oroperational complexity. It does not involve a reduction in a margin ofsafety since neither plant design nor reactor operating procedures arechanged. In addition, it does not alter any safety related design basisof the facility. Therefore, the proposed amendment neither creates thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident nor does it involvean increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previouslyevaluated. 7. The Estimated Resource Burden on the NRC Associated With the ProposedBackfit and the Availability of Such Resources The proposed amendment has no significant resource implications for theNRC. 8. The Potential Impact of Differences in Facility Type, Design or Ageon the Relevancy and Practicality of the Proposed Backfit The proposed amendment is uniformly relevant and applicable to all licensednuclear power plants without regard to type, design or age. 9. Whether the Proposed Backfit is Interim or Final and, if Interim, theJustification for Imposing the Proposed Backfit on an Interim Basis The proposed backfit is final. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>10 CFR Part 70 Hazardous materials - transportation, Nuclear materials, Packaging andcontainers, Penalty, Radiation protection, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Scientific equipment, Security measures, Special nuclearmaterial. 10 CFR Part 72 Manpower training programs, Nuclear materials, Occupational safety andhealth, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Spentfuel. 10 CFR Part 73 Hazardous materials - transportation, Incorporation by reference, Nuclearmaterials, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Penalty, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Security measures. 10 CFR Part 75 Intergovernmental relations, Nuclear materials, Nuclear power plants andreactors, Penalty, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures.For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is proposing to adoptthe following amendments to 10 CFR parts 70, 72, 73, and 75. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 70_DOMESTIC LICENSING OF SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL </ITAG>1.

An acceptable safeguards contingency planmust contain (1) a predetermined set of decisions and actions to satisfystated objectives, (2) an identification of the data, criteria, procedures,and mechanisms necessary to effect efficiently the decisions and actions,and (3) a specification of the individual, group, or organizational entityresponsible for each decision and action. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The goals of licensee safeguards contingency plans for dealing withthreats, thefts, and radiological sabotage are (1) to organize the responseeffort at the licensee level, (2) to provide predetermined, structuredresponses by licensees to safeguards contingencies, (3) to ensure the integrationof the licensee response with the responses by other entities, and (4)to achieve a measurable performance in response capability. Licensee safeguardscontingency planning should result in organizing the licensee's resourcesin such a way that the participants will be identified, their several responsibilitiesspecified, and the responses coordinated. The responses should be timelyand internally consistent among themselves. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is important to note that a licensee's safeguards contingency planis intended to be complementary to any emergency plans developed pursuantto appendix E to part 50 of this chapter or to andSection; 70.22(i) of part70 of this chapter. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When so required in this chapter, each licensee shall establish, maintainand follow a safeguards contingency plan in accordance with the criteriaset forth in this appendix.

(The first four categoriesof information, as set forth in this appendix, are Background, GenericPlanning Base, Licensee Planning Base, and Responsibility Matrix. The fifthcategory of information, Procedures, does not have to be submitted forapproval.) The plan becomes effective 30 days after approval by the Commissionunless otherwise specified by the Commission in writing. When the planbecomes effective, the licensee shall have: (1) All safeguards capabilitiesspecified in its safeguards contingency plan available and functional,(2) detailed procedures developed according to this appendix availableat the licensee's site, and (3) all appropriate personnel trained to respondto safeguards incidents as outlined in the plan and specified in the detailedprocedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Audit and Review </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The licensee shall provide for the implementation, revision, and maintenanceof its safeguards contingency plan.
