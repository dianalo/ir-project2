Conservatives are solidly in control of the Republican Party. They dominate the GOP convention, last week rebuffing attempts to soften hard-line conservative platform planks on abortion, affirmative action and the Equal Rights Amendment.    &quot;The Republican Party is a profoundly conservative party at its roots,&quot; declares Gary Bauer, a conservative White House policy adviser. For generations, the GOP had a long tradition of accommodating moderate-liberal views within the party. But increasingly over the last dozen or so years, the moderate-liberal wing -- personified by the late New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller in the 1960s and 1970s -- has ceased to be a factor.    George Bush clearly had the conservatives' influence in mind when he selected Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate. &quot;If I had a choice, I would have preferred someone else,&quot; says liberal New York Rep. Bill Green. &quot;But I don't have any choice.&quot;    According to an NBC News survey of the convention delegates, 25% of them describe themselves as moderates. (Only 3% of the delegates said they were very or somewhat liberal.) But their voices are barely heard here, drowned out by the dominant conservative chorus.    There are two reasons for the fading prominence of Republican moderates. One is the way Ronald Reagan has personally dominated the party for the past eight years, single-handedly setting the agenda. Second is the fact that, on issues of the economy and national security, there aren't any significant disagreements. The party's platform, which bears the solid imprint of the conservatives, won praise from even William Hudnut, the moderate mayor of Indianapolis. &quot;It shows that the Democrats do not have a lock on compassion,&quot; Mr. Hudnut said of the document.    &quot;They found they had far less to disagree with Reagan about than they thought,&quot; says GOP political consultant John Sears.    What does separate the conservatives and the moderates are such social issues as abortion and the federal government's role in education and protecting the environment and the rights of minorities. On each, the dominant stand within the party is the conservatives' stand.    The moderates seem willing to accept their own minority status within the party. &quot;When somebody else has the ball and it's their game, they can play it anyway they want,&quot; says Nancy Thompson, a moderate delegate from the District of Columbia. &quot;It's just a question of who's got the power.&quot;    Moderate leaders contrast that with the unyielding stands of hard-line conservatives. &quot;Their politics is pure argument, just kicking people in the shins,&quot; says William McKenzie, executive director of the Ripon Society, a Washington-based organization of moderate and liberal Republicans. &quot;We're more serious about governing and they're more serious about being correct on each and every issue.&quot;    Moderates say, for instance, that the Republican Party's problems with women voters stem from its failure to reach out on issues important to them, including abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment. On NBC Monday night, three Republican women in the House -- Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, Lynn Martin of Illinois and Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island -- all said the GOP platform doesn't really address any of those concerns. A member of the committee that wrote the platform, Rep. Johnson led the unsuccessful fight to change its abortion language. &quot;The majority of Republicans don't think that way, and have come to sort of disregard that section,&quot; she said of the anti-abortion plank.    There is one point on which conservatives and moderates agree -- a point that gives the conservatives pause and the moderates hope. That is the possibility that George Bush may well be a closet moderate.    &quot;His tolerance of different points of view would tend to act as a brake on the ideology that has been rampant in the Republican Party over the last decade,&quot; says Ken Rupert, director of the Republican Mainstream Committee, a group that is trying to build moderate GOP grassroots political organizations.    Other moderates believe that the post-Reagan Republican Party presents them with an opportunity to shift the debate to include many of the social issues they care about that were given short shrift by Mr. Reagan.    Now that the Reagan revolution has corrected the excesses of the federal government, says GOP media adviser Doug Bailey, &quot;there are issues that deserve a little more attention. That's not a rejection of the Reagan administration, it's a definition of its success.&quot;    John Axel, a delegate from Muscatine, Iowa, doesn't worry about the distance between his views on women's and minority rights and those of most of the delegates at this convention. He understands the cycles of politics: Eight years ago he went to Detroit as a delegate for a losing candidate named George Bush.    &quot;I don't get hung up about being in the minority,&quot; he says. &quot;These things change over time. There'll be another day.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
