An NRA is used to announce NASA's research interestsand, after peer or scientific review using factors in the NRA, select proposalsfor funding. Unlike an RFP containing a statement of work or specificationto which offerors are to respond, an NRA provides for the submission ofcompetitive project ideas, conceived by the offerors, in one or more programareas of interest to NASA. The NRA is intended to be used for those researchprocurements for which it would be impossible to draft an adequate requestfor proposals in sufficient detail without restraining the technical response,and thus hindering the competition of ideas rather than expanding competition.Consequently, an NRA shall not be used in place of an RFP when the procurementrequirement is narrowly defined and it is necessary to use a detailed descriptionor specification.(b) <T3>Issuance. </T3>(1) Each NRA shall be assigned a unique number in accordancewith 1804.7102-1.(2) NRAs may remain open for proposal submission for a maximum of one year.They may not be amended or modified once issued, but may be reissued byassigning a new number and resynopsizing. (See also 1835.016-70(g).) NRAsshould remain open for at least 90 days.(3) Before issuance, each field-generated NRA shall be concurred in bythe Procurement Officer and approved by the Field Installation Directoror designee, who shall serve as or designate a selecting official. Beforeissuance, each Headquarters-generated NRA shall be concurred in by GeneralCounsel (Code GK) and the Director, Headquarters Grants and Contracts Division(Code HW) and approved by the cognizant Program Associate Administratoror designee, who shall serve as or designate a selecting official. If aHeadquarters-generated NRA may result in awards by a NASA field installation,the concurrence of that installation's Procurement Officer may be soughtin place of or in addition to Code HW's concurrence.(4) The contracting officer shall assure that the NRA is synopsized inthe Commerce Business Daily (CBD). The CBD synopsis required by FAR 35.016(c)satisfies the synopsis requirement at FAR 5.201 and the synopsis contemplatedby FAR 5.205 is not required. The synopsis shall be brief and provide theaddress for obtaining a copy of the detailed NRA. The technical part ofthe synopsis is intended to describe an identifiable area of interest andshould not exceed 50 words.(5) The NRA shall be prepared, printed, and distributed by or under thedirection of the selecting official. Distribution shall not begin untilthe concurrence of the Procurement Officer has been obtained and the contractingofficer has confirmed that the synopsis requirements have been met. TheNRA shall be distributed to each coordinating office responsible for receiptof unsolicited proposals and to the Office of Procurement (Code HS).(6) In addition to the approvals in paragraph (b)(3) above, each Installationshall submit its first two NRAs to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement(Code HS) for concurrence before issuance.(c) <T3>Content. </T3>The NRA shall consist of the following items in the ordershown. This entire package shall be provided in response to requests.(1) <T3>Cover. </T3>The cover shall display: (i) ``OMB Approval Number 2700-0042'' in the upper right corner. (ii) Title (centered, in uppercase). (iii) ``NASA Research Announcement Soliciting Research Proposals for thePeriod Ending <T2>XXXX</T2>'' (centered, on three lines, two inches below the title,insert closing date). (iv) NRA number (centered, two inches below closing date). (v) Official address for office issuing NRA (centered, at bottom of cover).(2) <T3>Summary and Supplemental Information.</T3> (i) The Summary and Supplemental Information shall not exceed two pagesand shall include: (A) Title (centered, in uppercase). (B) Introductory paragraphs describing the purpose of the NRA and the periodfor receipt of proposals. When proposals received during this period maybe grouped for evaluation at separate times, the introductory paragraphsshall indicate when evaluations are planned and shall include the followingremark:<ITAG tagnum="21">A proposal that is scientifically and programmatically meritorious,but that cannot be accepted during its initial review under an NRA dueto funding uncertainties may be included in subsequent reviews unless theofferor requests otherwise.</ITAG>(C) NRA number. (D) Address for submitting proposals, including ``ATTN: NRA <T2>XXXX</T2>.'' (E) Copies required. (F) Selecting official's title. (G) Name, address, and telephone number for additional technical information.(H) Name and telephone number of Procurement Office point of contact foradministrative and contractual information. (I) Additional instructions which supplement the Instructions for Respondingto NASA Research Announcements for Solicited Research Proposals (see 1870.2).Such information shall be kept to the minimum necessary for a particularNRA and shall cite specific ``Instructions'' paragraphs supplemented. (J) When awards will be chargeable to funds of the new fiscal year andthe NRA is to be issued before funds are available, the NRA shall containa statement as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Funds are not presently available for awards under this NRA. The Government'sobligation to make awards is contingent upon the availability of appropriatedfunds from which payment for award purposes can be made and the receiptof proposals which the Government determines are acceptable for award underthis NRA.</ITAG>(ii) The Summary and Supplemental Information may include estimates ofthe amount of funds that will be available and the number of anticipatedawards. A breakdown of the estimates by research area may also be shown.(iii) The Summary and Supplemental Information may indicate that proposalssubmitted under an earlier NRA and held for subsequent reviews will beconsidered and need not be resubmitted. To so indicate, the earlier NRAshall be identified by number in the following statement:<ITAG tagnum="21">Proposals for which no selection decision was made under NRA <T2>XXXX</T2> and held for subsequent reviews will be considered underthis NRA and need not be resubmitted.</ITAG>(3) Technical Description. The first page shall contain the NRA numberand title at the top. A brief description not exceeding two pages is preferable,but it should be detailed enough to enable ready comprehension of the researchareas of interest to NASA. Specifications containing detailed statementsof work more suited to RFPs should be avoided. Any program management informationincluded must be limited to matters that are essential for proposal preparation.(4) Instructions for Responding to NASA Research Announcements for SolicitedResearch Proposals. The NRA shall contain instructions in accordance with1870.203. (d) <T3>Unsolicited proposals. </T3>(1) Unsolicited proposals for new effortsthat are within the scope of an open NRA shall be evaluated in accordancewith 1815.506(b). (2) Unsolicited proposals for renewal of ongoing efforts that are withinthe scope of an open NRA shall be evaluated in accordance with 1815.505-70.(3) A broad agency announcement shall not be considered to be an ``acquisitionrequirement'' as the term is used in FAR 15.507(a)(2). (e) <T3>Receipt of proposals, evaluation, and selection. </T3>(1) Proposalsshall be protected as provided in 1815.508-70 and 1815.509-70. (2) Evaluation, selection, and award may occur during or after the periodestablished for receipt of proposals. Late proposals and modificationsshall be treated in accordance with 1815.412 (a) and (b). (3) When more than one time is established in the NRA for evaluating proposals,proposals received prior to the time established will be considered aspart of the initial group to be evaluated. Subsequent groups of proposalsto be evaluated shall be formed from those proposals received after thetime established for the earlier evaluation groups and prior to the timeestablished for a subsequent group, along with those proposals, if any,held over under paragraph (e)(8) below. (4) The selection decision shall be made following peer or scientific reviewof a proposal. Peer or scientific review shall involve evaluation, outsideNASA, by a discipline specialist in the area of the proposal or evaluationby an in-house specialist or both. Evaluation by specialists outside NASAshall be conducted subject to the conditions in FAR 15.413-2(f) and 1815.413and 1815.413-2. In particular, the selecting official shall ensure compliancewith FAR 15.413-2(f)(5) regarding the designation of outside evaluatorsand avoidance of conflicts of interest. After receipt of a proposal andprior to selection, scientific or engineering personnel shall communicatewith an offeror, regarding the proposal, only for the purpose of clarification,as defined in FAR 15.601, or in order to understand the meaning of someaspect of the proposal which is not clear or obtain confirmation or substantiationof a proposed approach, solution, or cost estimate. (5) Competitive range determinations shall not be made, and best and finaloffers shall not be requested. (6) All or part of a proposal may be selected unless the offeror requestsotherwise. In addition, changes to a selected proposal may be sought aslong as (i) the ideas or other aspects of the proposal on which selectionis based are contained in the proposal as originally submitted, and arenot introduced by the changes; and (ii) the changes sought would not involvea material alteration to the requirements stated in the NRA. Changes thatwould affect a proposal's selection shall not be sought. When changes aredesired, they may be described to the contracting officer under paragraph(e)(10)(ii) below, or the selecting official may request revisions fromthe offeror. The changes shall not transfer information from one offeror'sproposal to another offeror (see FAR 15.610(d)(2)). When collaborationbetween offerors would improve proposed research programs, collaborationmay be suggested to the offerors. (7) The basis for selection of a proposal shall be documented in a selectionstatement applying the evaluation factors in the NRA. The selection statementrepresents the conclusions of the selecting official and must be self-contained.It shall not incorporate by reference the evaluations of the reviewers.(8) A proposal that is scientifically and programmatically meritorious,but that is not selected during its initial review under an NRA may beincluded in subsequent reviews unless the offeror requests otherwise. Ifthe proposal is not to be held over for subsquent reviews, the offerorshall be notified that the proposal was not selected for award.   (9) The selecting official shall notify each offeror whose proposal wasnot selected for award and explain generally why the proposal was not selected.It requested, the selecting official shall arrange a debriefing under 1815.1003,with the participation of a contracting officer.  (10) The selecting official shall forward to the contracting officer_ (i) The results of the technical evaluation, including the total numberof proposals received under the NRA by the time of selection, the selectionstatement, and the proposal(s) selected for funding; (ii) A description of any changes desired in any offeror's statement ofwork, including the reasons for the changes and any effect on level offunding;  (iii) If a contract will be used to fund the proposal, a description ofdeliverables, including technical reports, and delivery dates, consistentwith the requirements of the NRA;  (iv) A procurement request;  (v) Comments on the offeror's cost proposal: either the selecting official'scomments, which may be based on the reviewers' comments, or copies of thereviewers' comments with any different conclusions of the selecting official.The comments shall address the need for and reasonableness of travel, computertime, materials, equipment, subcontracted items, publication costs, laborhours, labor mix, and other costs; and  (vi) A copy of the selected proposal as originally submitted, any revisions,and any related correspondence from the successful offeror.  (11) The selecting official may provide to the contracting officer copiesof the reviewers' evaluations. Reviewers' names and institutions may beomitted in order to protect their identity.  (12) The selecting official may notify each offeror whose proposal wasselected for negotiation leading to award.  (i) The notification shall state that_ (A) The proposal has been selected for negotiation leading to award;  (B) The offeror's business office will be contacted by a contracting officer,who is the only official authorized to obligate the Government; and   (C) Any expenses incurred by the offeror in anticipation of receiving anaward will be at the risk of the offeror.  (ii) The notification may identify which award instrument (contract, grant,cooperative agreement, or other agreement) has been recommended.  (f) <T3>Award. </T3>If a contract is selected as the award instrument (seeFAR 35.003(a) and 1835.003(a)), the contracting officer shall_  (1) Advise the offeror that the Government contemplates entering into negotiations;the type of contract contemplated to be awarded; and the estimated awarddate, level-of-effort, and delivery schedule;  (2) Send the offeror a model contract, it necessary, including modificationscontemplated in the offeror's statement of work, and request agreementor identification of any exceptions; the contract statement of work maysummarize the proposed research, state that the research shall be conductedin accordance with certain technical sections of the proposal, which shallbe identified by incorporating them into the contract by reference, andidentify any changes to the proposed research;  (3) Request the offeror to complete and return certifications and representationsand Standard Form 33, ``Solicitation, Offer, and Award,'' or other appropriateforms;  (4) Conduct negotiations in accordance with FAR Subparts 15.8 and 15.9,as applicable;  (5) Award a contract with reasonable promptness to the successful offerorby transmitting written notice of the award to that offeror; and  (6) Comply with FAR Subparts 4.6 and 5.3 on contract reporting and synopseson contract awards, to the extent required by these subparts.  (g) <T3>Cancellation of an NRA. </T3>When program changes, the absence of programfunding, or any other reason requires cancellation of an NRA, the contractingofficer shall publish a notice in the Commerce Business Daily.

Foreword<ITAG tagnum="21">a. NASA depends upon industry, educational institutions and othernonprofit organizations for most of its research efforts. While a numberof mechanisms have been developed over the years to inform the researchcommunity of those areas in which NASA has special research interests,these instructions apply only to ``NASA Research Announcements,'' a formof ``broad agency announcement'' described in 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 ofthe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The ``NASA Research Announcement(NRA)'' permits competitive selection of research projects in accordancewith statute while at the same time preserving the traditional conceptsand understandings associated with NASA sponsorship of research. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. These instructions are Appendix I to 18-70.203 of the NASA FederalAcquisition Regulation Supplement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">2. Policy  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. NASA fosters and encourages the submission of research proposalsrelevant to agency mission requirements by solicitations, ``NASA ResearchAnnouncements,'' which describe research areas of interest to NASA. Proposalsreceived in response to an NRA will be used only for evaluation purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. NASA does not allow a proposal, the contents of which are not availablewithout restriction from another source, or any unique ideas submittedin response to an NRA to be used as the basis of a solicitation or in negotiationwith other organizations, nor is a pre-award synopsis published for individualproposals.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. A solicited proposal that results in a NASA award becomes partof the record of that transaction and may be available to the public onspecific request; however, information or material that NASA and the awardeemutually agree to be of a privileged nature will be held in confidenceto the extent permitted by law, including the Freedom of Information Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">3. Purpose  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These instructions are intended to supplement documents identifiedas ``NASA Research Announcements.'' The NRAs contain programmatic informationand certain ``NRA-specific'' requirements which apply only to proposalsprepared in response to that particular announcement. These instructionscontain the general proposal preparation information which applies to responsesto all NRAs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"/><T3>4. Relationship To Award   </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">a. A contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement maybe used to accomplish an effort funded on the basis of a proposal submittedin response to an NRA. NASA does not have separate ``grant proposal'' and``contract proposal'' and ``contract proposal'' categories, so all proposalsmay be prepared in a similar fashion. NASA will determine the appropriateinstrument.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Grants are generally used to fund basic research in educationaland nonprofit institutions, while research in other private sector organizationsis accomplished under contract. Additional information peculiar to thecontractual process (certifications, cost and pricing data, facilitiesinformation, etc.) will be requested, as necessary, as the procurementprogresses. Contracts resulting from NRAs are subject to the Federal AcquisitionRegulation and the NASA FAR Supplement (NHB 5100.4). Any resulting grantsor cooperative agreements will be awarded and administered in accordancewith the NASA Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook (NHB 5800.1).  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"/><T3>5. Conformance to Guidance   </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">a. NASA dos not have any mandatory forms or formats for preparationof responses to NRAs; however, it is requested that proposals conform tothe procedural and submission guidelines covered in these instructions.In particular, NASA may accept proposals without discussion; hence, proposalsshould initially be as complete as possible and be submitted on the proposers'most favorable terms.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. In order to be considered responsive to the solicitation, a submissionmust, at a minimum, present a specific project within the areas delineatedby the NRA; contain sufficient technical and cost information to permita meaningful evaluation; be signed by an official authorized to legallybind the submitting organization; not merely offer to perform standardservices or to just provide computer facilities or services; and not significantlyduplicate a more specific current or pending NASA solicitation. NASA reservesthe right to reject any or all proposals received in response to an NRAwhen such action is considered in the best interest of the Government.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"/><T3>6. NRA-Specific Items   </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Several proposal submission items will appear in the NRA itself.These include: The unique NRA identifier; when to submit proposals; whereto send proposals; number of copies required; and sources for more information.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Items included in these instructions may be supplemented by theNRA, as circumstances warrant. Examples are: Technical points for specialemphasis; additional evaluation factors; and proposal length.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"/><T3>7. Proposal Contents   </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The following general information is needed in all proposals inorder to permit consideration in an objective manner. NRAs will generallyspecify topics for which additional information or greater detail is desirable.Each proposal copy shall contain all submitted material, including a copyof the transmittal letter if it contains substantive information.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Transmittal Letter or Prefatory Material</T3>_   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The legal name and address of the organization and specific divisionor campus identification if part of a larger organization;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) A brief, scientifically valid project title intelligible to ascientifically literate reader and suitable for use in the public press;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Type of organization: e.g., profit, nonprofit, educational, smallbusiness, minority, women-owned, etc.;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Name and telephone number of the principal investigator and businesspersonnel who may be contacted during evaluation or negotiation;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Identification of any other organizations that are currently evaluatinga proposal for the same efforts;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Identification of the specific NRA, by number and title, to whichthe proposal is responding;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Dollar amount requested of NASA, desired starting date, and durationof project;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) Date of submission; and   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(9) Signature of a responsible official or authorized representativeof the organization, or any other person authorized to legally bind theorganization (unless the signature appears on the proposal itself).   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"/><T3>c. Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information   </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">It is NASA policy to use information contained in proposals for evaluationpurposes only. While this policy does not require that the proposal beara restrictive notice, offerors or quoters should, in order to maximizeprotection of trade secrets or other information that is commercial orfinancial and confidential or privileged, place the following notice onthe title page on the proposal and specify the information subject to thenotice by inserting appropriate identification, such as page numbers, inthe notice. In any event, information (data) contained in proposals willbe protected to the extent permitted by law, but NASA assumes no liabilityfor use and disclosure of information not made subject to the notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The information (data) contained in [<T3>insert page numbers or other identification</T3>] of this proposalconstitutes a trade secret and/or information that is commercial or financialand confidential or privileged. It is furnished to the Government in confidencewith the understanding that it will not, without permission of the offeror,be used or disclosed other than for evaluation purposes; provided, however,that in the event a contract (or other agreement) is awarded on the basisof this proposal the Government shall have the right to use and disclosethis information (data) to the extent provided in the contract (or otheragreement). This restriction does not limit the Government's right to useor disclose this information (data) if obtained from another source withoutrestriction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">d. Abstract</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Include a concise (200-300 word if not otherwise specified in theNRA) abstract describing the objective of the proposed effort and the methodof approach.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">e. Project Description.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The main body of the proposal shall be a detailed statement ofthe work to be undertaken and should include objectives and expected significance;relation to the present state of knowledge in the field; and relation toprevious work done on the project and to related work in progress elsewhere.The statement should outline the general plan of work, including the broaddesign of experiments to be undertaken and an adequate description of experimentalmethods and procedures. The project description should be prepared in amanner that addresses the evaluation factors in these instructions andany additional specific factors in the NRA. Any substantial collaborationwith individuals not referred to in the budget or use of consultants shouldbe described. Note, however, that subcontracting significant portions ofa research project is discouraged.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) When it is expected that the effort will require more than oneyear for completion, the proposal should cover the complete project tothe extent that it can be reasonably anticipated. Principal emphasis should,of course, be on the first year of work, and the description should distinguishclearly between the first year's work and work planned for subsequent years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">f. Management Approach</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For large or complex efforts involving interactions among numerousindividuals or other organizations, plans for distribution of responsibilitiesand any necessary arrangements for ensuring a coordinated effort shouldbe described. Aspects of any required intensive working relations withNASA field centers that are not logical inclusions elsewhere in the proposalshould be described in this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">g. Personnel</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The principal investigator is responsible for direct supervision ofthe work and participates in the conduct of the research regardless ofwhether or not compensation is received under the award. A short biographicalsketch of the principal investigator, a list of principal publicationsand any exceptional qualifications should be included. Omit social securitynumber and other personal items which do not merit consideration in evaluationof the proposal. Give similar biographical information on other seniorprofessional personnel who will be directly associated with the project.Give the names and titles of any other scientists and technical personnelassociated substantially with the project in an advisory capacity. Universitiesshould list the approximate number of students or other assistants, togetherwith information as to their level of academic attainment. Any specialindustry-university cooperative arrangements should be described.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">h. Facilities and Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Describe available facilities and major items of equipment especiallyadapted or suited to the proposed project, and any additional major equipmentthat will be required. Identify any Government-owned facilities, industrialplant equipment, or special tooling that are proposed for use on the project.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Before requesting a major item of capital equipment, the proposershould determine if sharing or loan of equipment already within the organizationis a feasible alternative to purchase. Where such arrangements cannot bemade, the proposal should so state. The need for items that typically canbe used for both research and non-research purposes should be explained.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">i. Proposed Costs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Proposals should contain cost and technical parts in one volume:do not use separate ``confidential'' salary pages. As applicable, includeseparate cost estimates for salaries and wages; fringe benefits; equipment;expendable materials and supplies; services; domestic and foreign travel;ADP expenses; publication or page charges; consultants; subcontracts; othermiscellaneous identifiable direct costs; and indirect costs. List salariesand wages in appropriate organizational categories (e.g., principal investigator,other scientific and engineering professionals, graduate students, researchassistants, and technicians and other non-professional personnel). Estimateall manpower data in terms of man-months or fractions of full-time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Explanatory notes should accompany the cost proposal to provideidentification and estimated cost of major capital equipment items to beacquired; purpose and estimated number and lengths of trips planned; basisfor indirect cost computation (including date of most recent negotiationand cognizant agency); and clarification of other items in the cost proposalthat are not self-evident. List estimated expenses as yearly requirementsby major work phases. (Standard Form 1411 may be used). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Allowable costs are governed by FAR Part 31 and the NASA FAR SupplementPart 18-31 (and OMB Circulars A-21 for educational institutions and A-122for nonprofit organizations). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">j. Security </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Proposals should not contain security classified material. However,if the proposed research requires access to or may generate security classifiedinformation, the submitter will be required to comply with applicable Governmentsecurity regulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">k. Current Support </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For other current projects being conducted by the principal investigator,provide title of project, sponsoring agency, and ending date. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">l. Special Matters </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Include any required statements of environmental impact of theresearch, human subject or animal care provisions, conflict of interest,or on such other topics as may be required by the nature of the effortand current statutes, executive orders, or other current Government-wideguidelines. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Proposers should include a brief description of the organization,its facilities, and previous work experience in the field of the proposal.Identify the cognizant Government audit agency, inspection agency, andadministrative contracting officer, when applicable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">8. Renewal Proposals </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Renewal proposals for existing awards will be considered in thesame manner as proposals for new endeavors. It is not necessary that arenewal proposal repeat all of the information that was in the originalproposal upon which the current support was based. The renewal proposalshould refer to its predecessor, update the parts that are no longer current,and indicate what elements of the research are expected to be covered duringthe period for which extended support is desired. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A description of any significant findings since the most recent progressreport should be included. The renewal proposal should treat, in reasonabledetail, the plans for the next period, contain a cost estimate, and otherwiseadhere to these instructions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. NASA reserves the right to renew an effort either through amendmentof an existing contract or by a new award. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">9. Length </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, every effort should be madeto keep proposals as brief as possible, concentrating on substantive materialessential for a complete understanding of the project. Experience showsthat few proposals need exceed 15-20 pages. Any necessary detailed information,such as reprints, should be included as attachments rather than in themain body of the proposal. A complete set of attachments is necessary foreach copy of the proposal. As proposals are not returned, avoid use of``one-of-a-kind'' attachments: their availability may be mentioned in theproposal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">10. Joint Proposals </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Some projects involve joint efforts among individuals in differentorganizations or mutual efforts of more than one organization. Where multipleorganizations are involved, the proposal may be submitted by only one ofthem. In this event, it should clearly describe the role to be played bythe other organizations and indicate the legal and managerial arrangementscontemplated. In other instances, simultaneous submission of related proposalsfrom each organization might be appropriate, in which case parallel awardswould be made. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Where a project of a cooperative nature with NASA is contemplated,the proposal should describe the contributions expected from any participatingNASA investigator and agency facilities or equipment which may be required.However, the proposal must be confined only to that which the proposingorganization can commit itself. ``Joint'' proposals which purport to specifythe internal arrangements NASA will actually make are not acceptable asa means of establishing an agency commitment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">11. Late Proposals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A proposal or modification thereto received after the date or datesspecified in an NRA may still be considered if the selecting official deemsit to offer NASA a significant technical advantage or cost reduction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">12. Withdrawal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Proposals may be withdrawn by the proposer at any time. Offerors arerequested to notify NASA if the proposal is funded by another organizationor of other changed circumstances which dictate termination of evaluation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">13. Evaluation Factors</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, the principal elements (ofapproximately equal weight) considered in evaluating a proposal are itsrelevance to NASA's objectives, intrinsic merit, and cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Evaluation of a proposal's relevance to NASA's objectives includesthe consideration of the potential contribution of the effort to NASA'smission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Evaluation of its intrinsic merit includes the consideration ofthe following factors, none of which is more important than any other:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Overall scientific or technical merit of the proposal or uniqueand innovative methods, approaches, or concepts demonstrated by the proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques,or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achievingthe proposal objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposedprincipal investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are criticalin achieving the proposal objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Overall standing among similar proposals available for evaluationand/or evaluation against the known state-of-the-art.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Evaluation of the cost of a proposed effort includes the considerationof the realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost and the relationshipof the proposed cost to available funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">14. Evaluation Techniques</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Selection decisions will be made following peer and/or scientificreview of the proposals. Several evaluation techniques are regularly usedwithin NASA. In all cases, however, proposals are subject to scientificreview by discipline specialists in the area of the proposal. Some proposalsare reviewed entirely in-house where NASA has particular competence; othersare evaluated by a combination of in-house people and selected externalreviewers, while yet others are subject to the full external peer reviewtechnique (with due regard for conflict-of-interest and protection of proposalinformation), such as by mail or through assembled panels. Regardless ofthe technique, the final decisions are always made by a designated NASAselecting official. A proposal which is scientifically and programmaticallymeritorious, but which is not selected for award during its initial reviewunder the NRA may be included in subsequent reviews unless the proposerrequests otherwise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">15. Selection for Award</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. When a proposal is not selected for award, and the proposer hasindicated that the proposal is not to be held over for subsequent reviews,the proposer will be notified that the proposal was not selected for award.NASA will notify the proposer and explain generally why the proposal wasnot selected. Proposers desiring additional information may contact theselecting official who will arrange a debriefing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. When a proposal is selected for award, negotiation and award willbe handled by the procurement office in the funding installation. The proposalis used as the basis for negotiation with the submitter. Formal RFPs arenot used to obtain additional information on a proposal selected underthe NRA process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, the contracting officer may request certain business dataand may forward a model contract and other information which will be ofuse during the contract negotiation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">16. Cancellation of NRA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NASA reserves the right to make no awards under this NRA and, in theabsence of program funding or for any other reason, to cancel this NRAby having a notice published in the <T3>Commerce Business Daily. </T3>NASA assumes no liability for cancellingthe NRA or for anyone's failure to receive actual notice of cancellation.Cancellation may be followed by issuance and synopsis of a revised NRA,since amendment of an NRA is normally not permitted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-19516 Filed 8-26-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7510-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
