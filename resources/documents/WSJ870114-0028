The moves follow the naming of William T. Gross, an executive vice president, as president of Douglas Aircraft earlier this month. As previously reported, St. Louis-based McDonnell decided recently to go ahead with production of the MD-11 wide-body passenger jet and also is producing the C-17 cargo plane for the U.S. military. As a result of these and other growing programs, employment at Douglas is expected to rise about 20% during the next year to about 30,000, a spokesman said.    Louis F. Harrington, formerly vice president, advanced products, was named senior vice president, commercial aircraft, including the MD-11 program and the MD-80 passenger jet.    Thomas M. Ryan, formerly vice president, product support, was named senior vice president, government products, in charge of the C-17 and other military programs.    Richard M. Randall, formerly vice president, contracts and pricing, was named senior vice president, finance and resource development.    All three report to Mr. Gross, who will temporarily continue to head the operations organization that handles manufacturing and other internal functions that support Douglas programs. It is likely that another executive will assume that spot, though a spokesman wouldn't comment. </TEXT></DOC>
