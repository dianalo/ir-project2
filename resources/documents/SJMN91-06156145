Its Fremont holdings consist of a six-building,210,000-square-foot Business Center Drive development that startedconstruction in spring 1989 and three other buildings purchased in 1989 and1990.;    Jack M. Langson, the company's managing partner, declined to beinterviewed. But in a written statement said: &quot;We are deeply embarrassed andapologize for the error.&quot;;    Mello and Santana were running for re-electionwhen the illegal contributions were made -- in August 1989 to Mello and inOctober 1989 to Santana.;    &quot;With regard to me, there is no story,&quot; Mellosaid. &quot;I am not in any way involved.&quot;;    In both cases, company employees inSan Jose donated to the politicians -- five donated $249 each to Mello and asixth donated $150 to Santana. The company reimbursed them, an action thatviolates state law which require the true identity of campaign donors.;   &quot;The contributions were made in . . . support of a candidate who our localpeople thought took a balanced approach to jobs and new development,&quot; saidLangson, who said the company &quot;in no way benefited from the contributions.&quot;;   Mello said the Fair Political Practices Commission did not contact him aboutthe company's violation.;    IBG also may have violated Fremont's municipalcampaign contribution limit law of $249 from one source. Alameda CountyAssistant District Attorney Joe Hurley said he had not heard about the caseand could not say whether the company would be prosecuted locally.;    TheFPPC is still investigating a 1989 complaint that alleged Mello received a$300 gift and failed to report it on his financial disclosure form.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DENNIS AKIZUKI, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910604  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  368  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 4, 199100156145,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
