IMFA,and the proposed regulations relating thereto, deal with a number of aspectsof the issue:First, IMFA creates a conditional basis of lawful permanent residence foraliens obtaining permanent residence within two years of marriage to aUnited States citizen or lawful permanent resident. It provides that theconditional basis shall be placed on the alien's permanent residence fora period of two years, and establishes a procedure by which the alien mayseek removal of the conditions at the end of the two-year period. It furtherpermits the revocation of an alien's permanent resident status under anyof three conditions:(1) If it is determined within the two-year period that the marriage wasentered into for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit or hasbeen judicially annualled or terminated, or that a fee or other considerationwas given for the filing of a petition for an immigration benefit;(2) If the alien and his/her spouse fail to file a joint petition for removalof the conditional status within the 90 days immediately preceding thesecond anniversary of the alien's having obtained conditional permanentresidence, although such failure may be excused; or(3) If the petition to remove the conditional basis of the alien's residentstatus is denied.Second, section 2(b) of Pub. L. 99-639 provides for the deportation ofan alien whose permanent resident status is revoked.Third, IMFA precludes the approval of a petition filed on behalf of analien who has conspired to engage in a fraudulent marriage or who has attemptedto obtain an immigration benefit on the basis of such marriage.Fourth, IMFA prevents an alien against whom an administrative or judicialproceeding is pending concerning his or her right to enter or remain inthe United States from obtaining an immigrant benefit on the basis of amarriage occurring during such proceedings.Fifth, IMFA precludes the approval of a spousal immigrant visa petitionfiled by an alien who obtained permanent residence through marriage unless:(1) The alien petitioner has been a permanent resident for at least fiveyears; or,(2) The alien establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the priormarriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws;or,(3) The alien's prior marriage was terminated through the death of his/herspouse.Sixth, IMFA provides for criminal penalties for individuals who are convictedof having engaged in a fraudulent marriage.Seventh, IMFA requires that the petitioner and beneficiary of a Petitionto Classify Status of Alien Fiance or Fiancee for Issuance of NonimmigrantVisa (Form I-129F) have met within the two-year period immediately precedingthe filing of the petition, unless such requirement is waived.Eighth, IMFA requires that an alien finance or fiancee of a United Statescitizen must apply for permanent residence through the normal adjustmentprocedures contained in section 245 of the Immigration and NationalityAct, as amended (the Act), instead of the automatic procedures formerlycontained in section 214(d) of the Act.Ninth, IMFA creates a new section, 245(d), which precludes an alien whoobtained conditional permanent residence as the spouse of a citizen orlawful permanent resident from adjusting status on any other basis. Italso precludes an alien who entered the United States as a nonimmigrantunder section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act and failed to marry the citizenpetitioner from obtaining permanent residence on any other basis.In addition to creating new regulations, this rulemaking revises existingregulations, including those sections relating to:(1) Revocation of visa petitions to allow for revocation of petitions approvedcontrary to the provisions of IMFA,(2) Documentary requirements for immigrants to permit the readmission ofan otherwise eligible conditional resident, (3) Reentry permits and refugee travel documents to allow issuance of suchdocumentation to conditional residents,(4) Admission of aliens to provide procedures for the admission or readmissionof conditional residents, and(5) Deportation proceedings to provide for cancellation of an Order toShow Cause under certain circumstances and to specify the conditions underwhich an immigration judge shall grant conditional residence in a deportationhearing.During the comment period, the Service received a total of sixteen commentsfrom interested parties. Ten comments were received from private law firmsor attorney associations, four from Service employees, one from a citizen'sgroup interested in immigration reform and one from a religious denomination.Most commenters chose to comment on several aspects of the regulations.All of the suggestions and opinions submitted by the commenters were carefullyreviewed and given full consideration. Many of the comments suggestingminor changes in the rulemaking have been incorporated into the final regulations.The Service appreciates the time and effort devoted by each of the interestedparties in this regard. A summary of these comments and the Service responsefollow (because most people made more than one comment, the total numberof comments exceeds the number of commenters):(1) <T3>Comment:</T3> Three parties wrote to express their disagreement withthe basic purpose of IMFA (and, by extension the regulations) and to questionthe constitutionality of the statute.<T3>Response:</T3> The Service fully supports IMFA; however, the rulemakingprocess is not the proper forum to discuss the issues of constitutionality.(2) <T3>Comment:</T3> Two people wrote that the two forms mentioned in therulemaking (Forms I-751 and I-752) should be included in 8 CFR 299, andtheir fees published in 8 CFR 103.1. Three other felt that the Servicewas remiss in not publishing regulations pertaining to section 212(a)(19),an exclusion ground which was amended by IMFA.<T3>Response:</T3> The information about the forms will soon be publishedunder a separate rulemaking. When the proposed rulemaking was drafted,the forms had not yet been developed, nor had the fees been determined.The separate rulemaking will reflect that the fee for filing the JointPetition to Remove the Conditional Basis of Alien's Permanent ResidentStatus (From I-751) will be $35.00, and the fee for filing the Applicationfor Waiver of Requirement to File Joint Petition for Removal of Conditions(Form I-752) will be $65.00.Likewise, the Service will consider publishing a proposed rulemaking relatingto section 212(a)(19) of the Act. In so doing, the Service will solicitcomments from the public on the proposal.(3) <T3>Comment:</T3> A number of interested parties requested clarificationabout the effects of IMFA on the ability of a resident alien to file arelative visa petition for a new spouse within five years of obtainingstatus through another marriage. Specifically, one asked if the Servicecould deny a petition based on information in the petitioner's file withoutaffording the petitioner an opportunity to review and rebut the information,and another argued that the standard of proof regarding the nonfraudulentnature of the petitioner's prior marriage (through which status was acquired)is higher in the proposed regulations than in the statute.<T3>Response:</T3> The first concern is unfounded, since existing regulationsat 8 CFR 103.2(b)(2) require that an alien be given an opportunity to reviewand rebut any derogatory evidence upon which a decision is based and ofwhich the alien is unaware (with the exception of classified information).With regard to the second concern, the language of the regulation has beenchanged to comport with the statutory language.(4) <T3>Comment:</T3> Three commenters felt that the regulations do not adequatelyexplain what procedure should be followed by an alien who cannot file theI-751 due to the termination of the marriage through divorce or annulment,or through the death of the petitioning spouse, or if the petitioning spouserefuses to join in the filing. Another requested that 8 CFR 216.4(a) beclarified to show that an Application for Waiver of Requirement to FileJoint Petition for Removal of Conditions (Form I-752) could be filed inlieu of the joint petition (Form I-751) within the 90 days immediatelypreceding the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtainedconditional permanent resident status.<T3>Response:</T3> The proper procedure is to file the I-752. The regulationshave been revised at andSection; 216.4(a) to clarify this point. 8 CFR 216.4(a)has been clarified as requested.(5) <T3>Comment:</T3> Three persons wrote that the list of documents whichmay be submitted in support of the petition or waiver is too restrictiveand does not take into account differences in culture, economic statusor lifestyle which may affect a couple's ability to document their relationship.<T3>Response:</T3> Recognizing that cultural, economic and other differencesaffect the documentation which is available to support the joint petition,the Service did not intend that the list be all inclusive. Accordingly,the regulation allows for the submission of ``other documentation establishingthat the marriage was not entered into in order to evade the immigrationlaws of the United States'' (andSection; 216.4(a)(5)(vi)). However, as withall other applications and petitions, it is the responsibility of the applicantor petitioner to show that the documentation is both relevant and convincing.(6) <T3>Comment:</T3> Two parties stated that prior to terminating status underthe provisions of section 216(b) or 216(c) of the Act, the Service shouldissue a Notice of Intent to terminate status in all cases, not just thosebased upon information ``which the alien cannot reasonably be expectedto have.'' They reasoned that this will allow the alien an opportunityto rebut the evidence and may prevent the Service from terminating thestatus of a conditional resident inappropriately.<T3>Response:</T3> The proposed regulation has been modified to state thatthe director must allow the alien an opportunity to review and rebut theevidence upon which the termination is based, in accordance with 8 CFR103.2(b)(2). Although this will normally necessitate a written Notice ofIntent to Terminate, the regulation does not preclude situations in whichwritten notification is not needed (e.g., if the alien is the source ofthe Service's information).(7) <T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters wrote concerning the bar to approvalof a petition filed on behalf of an alien who has attempted or conspiredto enter into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws(section 204(c) of the Act). One writer asked whether there is a time limitor if there is a waiver that may be granted. Another expressed concernthat the Service might base denials on information contained in its fileswithout allowing the petitioner an opportunity to review and rebut theinformation.<T3>Response:</T3> The law does not provide for either a waiver or an expirationof the bar. The restriction is both permanent and not waivable. As statedearlier, 8 CFR 103.2(b)(2) precludes decisions being based on informationwhich the alien has not had an opportunity to review and rebut.(8) <T3>Comment:</T3> Several questions arose regarding the requirement insection 204(h) of the Act that an alien who marries while in proceedingsreside outside the United States for two years before an immigrant visapetition may be approved in his or her behalf. One writer (although recognizingthat the language of the statute is mandatory) urged ``the most humanitarianinterpretation'' of the requirement. Another could not understand whetherthe two year period began with the alien's departure from the United Statesor with the marriage. Two others felt that the Service should accept petitionsduring the prohibited period and hold them for approval after the two yearshas elapsed, arguing that the statute prohibits petitions being approved,not filed. One commenter felt that the provisions of section 204(h) shouldnot apply to marriages occurring after the issuance, but before the service,of the Order to Show Cause. Four others wrote that they should only applyto marriage occurring during the course of the actual hearing before theExecutive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) which includes both theImmigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals, or during judicialreview of the decision by the EOIR (i.e., that they should not apply tomarriages celebrated during the period from the issuance of the Order toShow Cause to the opening of court by the judge, or from the time of thejudge's decision to the alien's departure). Five parties felt that theprovisions should only relate to exclusion and deportation proceedings,not rescission proceedings. Five others asked for clarification of thelanguage of the rulemaking whereby the provisions of section 204(h) donot apply if the Order to Show Cause is terminated.<T3>Response:</T3> The statute does not allow the Service any latitudein determining whether to apply the provisions of section 204(h) of theAct. If an alien marries during proceedings, a petition cannot be approvedin his or her behalf until the requirement of two years of residence outsidethe United States has been met. Since this two year period begins withthe alien's departure following the marriage, any period(s) of residenceoutside the United States prior to the marriage cannot be credited towardthis requirement. However, it should be noted that the statute does notrequire that the alien remain outside the United States continuously foran uninterrupted time period, meaning that the alien could comply withthe requirement by completing two or more periods of residency outsidethe United States as long as the aggregate total of such periods reachedtwo years.The suggestion that the Service accept petitions prior to the completionof the two year period for approval once the requirement is met must berejected. The Service has long held that a petition must be approvableat the time that it is filed, not merely at some subsequent time. Allowinga petitioner to file a petition before it is approvable would enable thebeneficiary to obtain a priority date to which he is not entitled, therebygiving the beneficiary an unfair advantage over other immigrant visa applicants.Section 204(h) prohibits the approval of petitions based on marriages celebratedduring the period described in section 245(e)(2), which is ``the periodduring which administrative or judicial proceedings are pending regardingthe alien's right to enter or remain in the United States,'' until thealien has completed the foreign residence requirement. This phrase encompassesmore than just the period when the matter is pending before an immigrationjudge, on appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals or under judicialreview. It does not end when the order of the judge becomes final or whenthe time allotted for appeal or judicial review expires. Had Congress intendedthat the period described in section 245(e)(2) be limited to the periodwhen the matter was pending before the EOIR or before the courts on judicialreview, it would have so stated. Instead, Congress chose the broader conceptincluding all administrative (Service or EOIR) and judicial (the Federalcourt system) proceedings, including Service proceedings occurring beforeand after EOIR of judicial proceedings. The application of this broaderconcept for this purpose in no way affects the long-established applicationof narrower concepts relating to the finality of orders, periods for judicialreview, and so forth. On the other hand, the Service agrees with those who feel that the perioddescribed in section 245(e)(2) does not include rescission proceedings,and references to such proceedings have been removed from the final regulations.Normally, the departure of an alien from the United States terminates proceedingsto exclude or deport the alien; however, the Board of Immigration Appealshas held that under certain situations the departure of an alien does notterminate proceedings (e.g., if the alien merely slips across the borderand then reenters surreptitiously). The language of the regulation hasbeen clarified to reflect that a departure which does not terminate thedeportation or exclusion proceedings does not terminate the period describedin section 245(e)(2) either.(9) <T3>Comment:</T3> A few comments were received concerning the admissionof aliens under the K-1 nonimmigrant category as fiances of U.S. citizens.One religious organization requested that such fiances be admitted forlonger than 90 days, as the pre-marital counselling program of that denominationnormally lasts at least four months; another commenter suggested that theregulations specify that aliens admitted in this category are authorizedto accept employment; a third felt that the Service should preclude theapproval of a fiance petition arising out of an ``arranged marriage'' situation,finding that arranged marriages are ``cruel and barbaric'' and that permittingthem in the regulations encourages fraud; and a fourth felt that districtdirectors should have the authority to approve petitions as a matter ofdiscretion when the petitioner and beneficiary have been precluded fromseeing each other for more than two years.<T3>Response:</T3> The 90 day period for the admission of a K-1 nonimmigrantis set by statute. Although it was previously possible for an alien toadjust under a separate provision of the law if the marriage took placemore than 90 days after admission, IMFA now prohibits (by statute) suchseparate adjustment. Regardless of the benefits of a pre-marital counsellingprogram, the Service cannot allow by regulation that which is precludedby statute. K-1 nonimmigrants (and their dependent children admitted under the K-2category) are already authorized to accept employment under 8 CFR 274a.12(a)(6),and it is not necessary to restate that authorization in this rulemaking.Neither the letter nor the spirit of IMFA precludes fiance relationshipsbased upon arranged marriages. It is therefore beyond the scope and theintent of the rulemaking to prohibit the approval of a fiance petitionfiled in such cases. It is within the intent of both the statute and theregulations to ensure, to the extent possible, that the marriage has notbeen arranged in order to circumvent the immigration laws of this country.Accordingly, the discretionary authority of the district director shouldbe exercised to waive the ``have met'' requirement only when he or sheis satisfied that the petitioner and beneficiary are not seeking to entera fraudulent relationship, and that either all conditions of the arrangementshave been complied with (in arranged marriages) or that extreme hardshipto the petitioner would result (in other situations).District directors already have, by statute and regulation, the authorityto waive the requirement that the parties have previously met in person(section 3(a)(2) of IMFA and 8 CFR 214.2(k)(2) of this rulemaking). Inherentin this authority is the power to waive the requirement when the partieslast met more than two years before the filing of the petition.(10) <T3>Comment: </T3>One writer pointed out that there are now two sections216 in the Act, the one created by the Marriage Fraud Amendments and anothercreated by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). The IRCAsection 216 relates to temporary agriculatural workers, commonly referredto as ``H-2As''. <T3>Response:</T3> The writer is correct. However, it should also be pointedout that the regulations pertaining to the H-2A program are contained in8 CFR 214 (not 8 CFR Part 216) and that technical amendments to IRCA havebeen introduced in Congress which, if enacted, would redesignate the H-2Astatutory provisions as section 218 of the Act.(11) <T3>Comment: </T3>Several parties wrote concerning Service procecduresfor termination of the status of a conditional resident and issuance ofan Order to Show Cause. Two commenters wrote that in terminating an alien'sstatus pursuant to section 216 of the Act, the Service should not terminate``all rights and privileges thereto (including authorization to acceptor continue in employment in this country)'' at the same time. Instead,they felt that the Service should allow the alien to continue working untilhis case has been reviewed by an Immigration Judge in a deportation hearing.Another person believed that the issuance of an Order to Show Cause shouldnot be mandatory in every termination case. <T3>Response:</T3> The statute provides that the termination of statustakes effect when the Attorney General reaches his decision, but that thatdetermination may be reviewed in deportation proceedings. Because the alien'sstatus is terminated, the basis for the alien's employment authorizationas a permanent resident must also terminate at the same time. This doesnot preclude the alien from seeking and being granted employment authorizationon another basis, specifically under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(13) as an alien againstwhom deportation proceedings have been instituted. Any request for employmentauthorization on this basis would be adjudicated in accordance with theprovisions of that regulation. The only forum in which an alien may seek review of the Service's decisionto terminate his or her status is during a hearing before an immigrationjudge. For this reason, the regulations provide that the district directorshall issue an Order to Show Cause (which initiates the deportation proceeding)whenever an alien's status is terminated. Because of other factors, suchas the need for the alien to request employment authorization, the issuanceof the Order to Show Cause should normally occur simultaneously with theissuance of the Notice of Termination; however, the Service cannot ruleout the possibility that in some cases it may be to the advantage of boththe Service and the alien for the issuance of the Order to Show Cause tobe delayed.(12) <T3>Comment: </T3>Believing that some aliens were incorrectly admittedto the United States without conditions between November 1986 and January1987, one writer was concerned that aliens might be deprived of their statusfor failure to petition for removal when the alien did not know of theconditional basis of his status or of the requirement to file the petition.<T3>Response:</T3> Immediately upon enactment of IMFA, the Service notifiedall ports of entry and all offices adjudicating applications for adjustmentof the need to grant status conditionally under the provisions of the law,and of the need to notify the alien of the removal requirements. The Servicewill also mail written notification to all conditional residents remindingthem of the need to seek removal of the conditions. These notificationswill be sent to each conditional resident approximately 30 days beforethe beginning of the 90 day period during which he or she (and the spouse)must file the joint petition. Accordingly, the Service does not anticipatethat a large number of aliens will be unaware of their obligations underthe law. It should be noted that if an alien establishes that his failureto file the petition on time was for reasons beyond his control, the Servicemay accept a tardy petition.(13) <T3>Comment:</T3> Three parties felt that the Service should not requirea written request for rescheduling prior to the interview date if an alienand spouse are unable to appear for an interview in connection with theForm I-751. The statute does not require that it be submitted in advance,and the reasons preventing the couple from appearing may not arise untilthe last minute. <T3>Response:</T3> The prior notification requirement has been deletedfrom the regulation. If the alien establishes good cause for reschedulingor waiving the interview, the Service may do so, even if the request isnot received in advance. This applies to interviews conducted in conjunctionwith either the joint petition for removal (Form I-751) or the applicationfor waiver of the requirement to file the joint petition (Form I-752).(14) <T3>Comment:</T3> Several comments were received concerning the filingof a waiver by an alien whose marriage has been terminated. One writerobjected to the use of the phrase ``terminated by the alien spouse'' inthe statute and similar language in the rulemaking, since the judge grantingthe divorce or annulment is the one who actually terminated the marriage.Another writer felt that the Service should allow the filing of a ``goodfaith and good cause'' waiver when the conditional resident was not theparty initiating the divorce proceedings. A third commenter wrote that``fundamental fairness and due process require that in <T3>any</T3> instance where a finding has been made by a court of competentjurisdiction regarding actions of a U.S. citizen spouse, that the Serviceshould accept those as fact and not attack them collaterally, save in thoseinstances where compelling circumstances dictate otherwise. Even when thecourt's determinations are accepted as fact, the Service could still saythat even based on these facts, they do not see that the alien was withoutfault.''<T3>Response:</T3> IMFA states that in order to apply for a ``good faithand good cause'' waiver, the qualifying marriage must have been ``terminated(other than through the death of the spouse) by the alien spouse''. Thisstatutory language precludes the Service from granting a waiver when thedivorce or annulment proceedings were initiated by the spouse of the conditionalresident. For purposes of clarification, the language of the regulationhas been modified slightly to show that the alien spouse must be the initiatingparty in the proceedings, not the terminating authority.Although the Service will normally give considerable weight to the findingof the divorce court as to grounds for the action, the Service cannot bebound by the findings in all cases. It would simply be too easy for twoparties to engage in a fraud marriage scheme involving concocted groundswhich are not contested by the respondent. For this reason, the Servicemust be free to reach its own conclusions regarding the issue of ``goodcause''. Since any decision by the Service on this issue is subject toreview by the EOIR and then by the Federal courts, there is no reason tofear that the Service will not give appropriate weight to the findingsof the divorce court.(15) <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters wrote about the need for regulations concerningaliens who must be outside the United States during the period in whichthe joint petition (Form I-751) must be filed or while it is being adjudicatedby the Service. One writer pointed out that the Service should providefor the admission of alien commuters (i.e., permanent residents who resideor work in contiguous territory and commute to work across the border daily).Another requested clarification regarding procedures to be followed byaliens outside the United States pursuant to military or civilian ordersof the United States government.<T3>Response:</T3> The regulations have been modified to provide that aconditional resident alien (including an alien commuter) may be admittedto the United States with an expired Form I-551 if he is also in possessionof a receipt showing that he has filed a Joint Petition to Remove the ConditionalBasis of Alien's Permanent Resident Status (Form I-751) or an Applicationfor Waiver of Requirement to File Joint Petition for Removal of Conditions(Form I-752) within the six months immediately preceding the applicationfor admission, provided the joint petition or application is still pendingbefore the Service.The regulations have also been clarified to explain that an alien travellingoutside the country on government orders is deemed to be constructivelywithin the United States for purposes of filing the joint petition.(16) <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter asked for clarification of the terms ``extremehardship'', ``good cause'' and ``pertinent'' as they relate to applicationsfor waivers of the requirement to file the joint petition. Another askedfor clarification of the phrase ``involved in a conspiracy'' as used in8 CFR 204.1 and of the phrase ``within a reasonable time'' as used in 8CFR 212.7(a)(2).<T3>Response:</T3> The terms and phrases in question are all used in theregulation in accordance with their common, everyday meaning. The modifiers``extreme'', ``good'' and ``reasonable'' all call for the use of the director'sdiscretion. By their nature, these regulations cannot further restrictthat discretion. However, the review procedure (through the Executive Officefor Immigration Review and the Federal courts) will safeguard against thatdiscretion being improperly applied.The phrase ``involved in a conspiracy'' would only apply to individualswho are found to have participated in the activity. It would not apply,for example, to an individual who introduced two people who later conspiredon their own to commit fraud without the knowledge or participation ofthe first individual.(17) <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that the Service explain theconsequences if it fails to notify the alien of the requirement to filethe petition or if it fails to adjudicate the petition or interview thepetitioner within 90 days of its being filed, or within 90 days of theinterview. Another requested that the Service provide the attorney of recordwith a copy of the notification required at or about the beginning of the90 day filing period.<T3>Response:</T3> The language of the statute is explicit that the Service``shall provide notice'' at the time of the alien's admission and ``shallattempt to provide notice'' at or about the beginning of the 90 day filingperiod respecting the requirements to file the petition to remove. Thestatute further provides that failure of the Service to meet these notificationrequirements does not relieve the alien of his or her obligations. Likewise,the statute requires that a determination on the merits of the petitionbe made within 90 days of the interview (unless the interview is waived).(18) <T3>Comment:</T3> Finally, one writer opposed what he understood as theService's intent to bar from adjustment of status an alien lawfully admittedto the United States as a conditional permanent resident.<T3>Response:</T3> The regulatory language comports fully with the provisionsof section 245(d) of the Act as amended by section 2(e) and 3(b) of IMFA.Section 245(d) prohibits the adjustment of an alien who is already a (conditional)permanent resident or of an alien who entered the United States as a K-1or K-2 nonimmigrant (except as the spouse or step-child of the citizenwho filed the fiance petition upon which the K-1 or K-2 visa was issued).Perhaps the commenter failed to read the new section 245(d) of the Act,or perhaps he misinterpreted the regulation as prohibiting a conditionalresident from becoming a ``full'' or ``non-conditional'' permanent residentthrough the removal of conditions procedure set forth in section 216.Additional technical amendments are included to correct typographical errors.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies thatthis rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This rule is not a major rule within the meaningof section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule have federalism implicationswarranting the preparation of a Federal Assessment in accordance with E.O.12612.The information collection requirements contained in this document havebeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance withthe provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and are cited under 8 CFR299.5 which will be published in the near future.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG><T3>8 CFR Part 1   </T3>Administrative practice and procedure, Immigration. <T3>8 CFR Part 204   </T3>Administrative practice and procedure, Immigration, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements. <T3>8 CFR Part 205   </T3>Administrative practice and procedure, Immigration.   <T3>8 CFR Part 211   </T3>Immigration, Passports and visas, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <T3>8 CFR Part 212   </T3>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration, Passport andvisas, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.   <T3>8 CFR Part 214   </T3>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Employment, Foreign officials,Health professions, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Students.  <T3>8 CFR Part 216   </T3>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.   <T3>8 CFR Part 223   </T3>Aliens, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.   <T3>8 CFR Part 223a   </T3>Immigration, Refugees, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.   <T3>8 CFR Part 235   </T3>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.   <T3>8 CFR Part 242   </T3>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens.   <T3>8 CFR Part 245   </T3>Aliens, Immigration, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

(ii) In determining whether the petitioner has met the burden of establishingthat the marriage through which he or she obtained permanent residencewas not entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws, the directorshall take into account such factors as the length of time the petitionerand the prior spouse resided together, the existence of children born ofthe marriage, joint ownership of assets and assumption of liabilities,the grounds for which the marriage was terminated and other factors whichthe director may deem relevant. Because section 204(a)(2)(A)(ii) of theAct places the burden on the petitioner to establish ``by clear and convincingevidence'' that the prior marriage was not entered into for the purposeof evading the immigration laws, failure to meet this standard must resultin the denial of the petition; however, such a denial will be without prejudiceto the filing of a new petition once the petitioner has acquired five yearsof lawful permanent residence. The director may choose to initiate deportationproceedings against the petitioner based upon information gained throughthe adjudication of the petition, but failure to initiate such proceedingsshall not establish that the petitioner's prior marriage was not for thepurpose of evading immigration laws.
