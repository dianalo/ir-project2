The latest offer in the ongoing battle tops a $13.50-a-share, or $138 million, offer from International Fish andamp; Meat USA, a U.S. affiliate of a French concern that Wilson brought in as a friendly suitor. Doskocil, a maker of pizza toppings based in Hutchinson, Kan., has hinted that it would raise its offer for Wilson although the Oklahoma City company has repeatedly rebuffed its overtures.    In national over-the-counter trading, Wilson closed at $14.25, up $1, while Doskocil closed at $8.75, up 12.5 cents.    David Smoak, Doskocil's chief financial officer, said Doskocil decided to raise its offer from $12.25 a share after studying the terms of International Fish's offer, and after Doskocil received calls from companies interested in purchasing parts of Wilson. As previously reported, Doskocil primarily is interested in Wilson's delicatessen and foods businesses and is less excited about its fresh meats and packing businesses.    As part of its agreement, International Fish has an option to buy Wilson's Fischer Packing Co. unit for $35 million if its takeover offer falls through.    Because Doskocil already has a tender offer open, its latest offer can expire after 10 business days, or on Oct. 7. The International Fish tender offer, which began Sept. 16, must run for 20 business days, to Oct. 14.    A Wilson spokesman declined to comment on Doskocil's offer or on how Wilson might respond.    To finance the higher offer, Doskocil said it received a commitment for $20 million in bridge financing from an investment partnership led by Richard E. Rainwater. Mr. Rainwater is a former adviser to the Bass family of Fort Worth who has worked with Doskocil since the Bass family acquired a 10% stake in Doskocil several years ago.    Doskocil also said it asked the Delaware Chancery Court to force Wilson to provide it with the same information that has been provided to International Fish.    Doskocil initially offered $12.50 a share, or about $115 million, but trimmed its offer to $12.25 a share to reflect its cost to fight Wilson in court after Wilson's board refused to remove its poison pill anti-takeover measure.    Doskocil said terms of International Fish's merger agreement with Wilson call for Wilson to reimburse up to $7 million in expenses to International Fish if the acquisition isn't completed. </TEXT></DOC>
