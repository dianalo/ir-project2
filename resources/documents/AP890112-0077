(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who bilked investors into sinking $2.4million into a bogus self-chilling beverage container drew 12 yearsin prison despite his lawyer's insistence he was only a terrified``franchise'' for the mob.   Marshall Zolp, 42, was bullied by mobsters into carrying out thefraud, defense attorney Raymond Sussman said Wednesday.   But U.S. District Judge Alfred Lechner Jr. told Zolp: ``Yourconduct has been your character. You are a con man.''   Zolp, who could have received 20 years in prison, pleaded guiltyin 1987 to racketeering. Five others were convicted in the scheme topromote a phony self-chilling can.   Zolp and his co-defendants promoted Laser Arms, incorporated in1986, through fake news releases, ads, and shareholder reports. Theystaged a phony news conference and prepared company documents withphotos of actors portraying executives.   As part of a plea agreement, Zolp has been providing informationon organized-crime involvement in securities manipulation, saidSussman and Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert P. Warren. Indictmentsare expected, authorities said.   Warren said Zolp was used as a ``vehicle'' by mobsters and was``viewed by a number of people as a person they could franchise tomake money for them.''   Sussman agreed with the term franchise but said that mobstersbeat Zolp and threatened him to continue carrying out the Laser Armsfraud. Zolp, who was living in the Los Angeles area, is in thewitness protection program.   The Securities and Exchange Commission has implicated Zolp in atleast seven securities fraud cases nationwide since the early 1980s,authorities said.   Sussman said that despite a ``track record'' of securitiesviolations, Zolp never meant to perpetrate such an extended fraud asLaser Arms.   At one point, Sussman said, mobsters kidnapped Zolp, held a gunto his side, said he was to be murdered and beat him.</TEXT></DOC>
