<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-75-0190 </DOCNO><TEXT>A liquid with lower nonlinear refractive index, CCl{sub 4}, provided conjugatedbeams with clean near field distribution, unless astigmatism was addedto the input beam. Astigmatism caused fringing on the conjugated beam.The tendency toward fringing was diminished in our more recent experimentsin glass and methane. Measured thresholds and reflectances for both CS{sub2} and CC1{sub 4} agreed with published results. Waveforms of pulsesproduced by SBS are different from those of the input pulse. Except fortansients observed on the leading edge, all aspects of the SBS wave formcan be explained. Correction by conjugation in CC1{sub 4}for up to 4.5waves of astigmatism provided beams with divergence not greater thantwice the diffraction limit. Experimental error may account for someof the apparent divergence. 12 refs., 12 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
