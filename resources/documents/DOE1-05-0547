This is due to its high intensity, itsparallelism and its monochromaticity, available in a monochromator system.Experiments were performed using wiggler synchrotron radiation. Sincethe beam size is relatively small for in-vivo imaging, a phantom coupledwith a detector was moved horizontally using a scanning table. K-edgesubtraction was successfully applied both to the coronary artery phantomfilled with barium sulphate, and to rat angiography using iodine contrastmaterial. The potential use and value of energy subtraction was successfullydemonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
