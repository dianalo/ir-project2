The water washed about 50 pounds of asbestos insulation off twosteam pipes Sunday, and the asbestos-laden water poured into thestreet and into subway tunnels, officials said.   The 63-year-old, 20-inch underground main had been scheduled forreplacement Tuesday, officials said.   Asbestos has been linked to cancer, and the breathing of asbestosfibers is known to be especially dangerous. But the contaminationwas limited to the water and mud on the ground, making the risk topeople minimal if they avoided contact with it, Deputy Mayor RobertEsnard said.   Consolidated Edison, which owns the steam pipe, said no asbestosfibers became airborne. The utility had an underground steam pipeburst on Aug. 19, spewing fibers and forcing the evacuation of anapartment building.   The water-main break cut off water service temporarily Sunday,and 20 buildings including a hospital remained without hot watertoday because the steam pipes were turned off. The hot water wouldnot be turned on until the city's cleanup was complete, said LaurieHanson, a Con Ed spokeswoman.   Eighth Avenue between 52nd and 44th streets was to remain closedto traffic at least through Tuesday as cleanup crews used foam andwater to get rid of the asbestos debris, said Department ofTransportation chief Ross Sandler.   Merchants were barred from their stores and residents from theirapartments in the area. The Red Cross set up a shelter at a school.   Subway service along Eighth Avenue and on a shuttle that connectsmajor bus and train stations was expected to be disrupted throughtoday, the Transit Authority said.</TEXT></DOC>
