 Thehigh-end machines available today are capable of delivering the kind ofperformance more traditionally associated with minicomputers, and are aslikely to find themselves at the heart of a network or Unix system as theyare on an individual user's desk.andM;To address this, PC User has created a set of tests which will accuratelymeasure the performance of different networked machines in a controlled,realistic working environment.andP;  We'll be running the results of the testsover two issues.andP;  Part one starts here.andM;In the pages that follow we'll:andM;* outline the shift from stand-alone PCs to server-based systems.andM;* detail the configurations of our test bed machinesandM;* explain in detail our unique seven-strong LAN benchmark testsandM;* review our opening two contenders in the bus architecture wars -- Compaq'sEISA-based DeskPro 486 and Apricot's MCA-based VXFT Server.andM;* highlights the claimed technical distinctions between the MCA and EISAstandards.andM;* interview Apricot's Peter Horne about the importance of theserver/workstation marketandM;* detail our future test plans.andM;Networking will never be the same again.andM;The shift in focus from stand-alone single-user PC's to multi-userapplications has been drifting in since the launch of the first members ofthe 386 family at the end of 1986.andP;  Just about every year since has beenpredicted to be the Year of the LAN -- indeed, PC User conducted its firstsurvey of PC networks way back in 1984 -- and while initially this wassomething of a joke, few will dispute that the Year of the LAN is upon us atlast.andM;This has lead to a stratification of PCs according to their intended use.andO;While the majority of the markets is still comprised of general purposemachines capable of filling many roles for many users, specialist machinesare emerging to fulfill the more precise requirements of the multi-usermarket.andM;The first 486 in the world, the Apricot VXFT Server, showed the way.andP;  Sure,it can run Flight Simulator, Leisure Suit Larry and PC productivityapplications like 1-2-3 and WordStar, but its 5Gb drive capacity, eightexpansion slots, ultra-tight security, uninterruptable power supply andfiling cabinet size suggests that it was made with another purpose in mind.andM;While most of the other 486 PCs haven't been quite so obviously dedicated tothe multi-user market, they can, like the Compaq Deskpro 486 examined on thefollowing pages, support large amounts of memory, gigabytes of hard diskcapacity and bus architectures -- providing a new level of LAN service.andM;Some not-so-subtle changes have been taking place in the PC market.andP;  Whilesingle-user PCs will, in all probability remain the most popularconfiguration, corporate users have been tying them together as workstationsor terminals to mainframe or mini-based company information.andP;  PCs withbuilt-in communications facilities are no longer oddities.andP;  Some PCs havebeen specifically cut down to supply the minimum function for networkworkstations, thus decreasing the total system cost for network buyers.andO;Compaq is said to be ready to roll out two of these in the Spring.andM;The additional performance offered by these high-end network and Unix serverspresents corporate purchasers with something of a problem.andP;  Single-userbenchmarks can't be extended to cover this high-powered environment.andP;  Inresponse, PC User has developed a series of tests that will exercise LANserver performance and can be used to sort out winners and losers.andM;Our intent is to establish a level playing field -- although we realize thatsome are more level than others.andP;  That's why we'll be reserving space for theLAN spokespersons of the companies with products under test.andP;  The losers arewelcome to pick holes in our setup and the winners can underscore just whytheir products fit most users' needs and why our benchmarks are spot on.andM;One last point.andP;  It's important to understand that we are testing productsthat are available now.andP;  In an ideal world, for example, both networkadaptors would be bus master cards supporting the full EISA and MCAspecification - that's where you'll see real performance improvements.andP;  Asthese products become available, they'll be put through the PC User LANbenchmark tests.andM;Here's our lineup for the first round:andM;Apricot VXFT ServerandM;* 25MHz 80486 CPUandM;* Built-in Ethernet interfaceandM;* 3+OPEN Version 1.1andM;* SQL ServerandM;* 300MB SCSI hard diskandM;* 8Mb RAMandM;* Price 12,195 poundsandM;Compaq Deskpro 486/25andM;* 25MHz 80486 CPUandM;* Torus 32-bit EISA Ethernet adaptorandM;* 3+OPEN Version 1.1andM;* 320Mb ESDI hard diskandM;* 4Mb RAMandM;* Price 12,995 poundsandM;IBM OS/2 Nestation Model 70-121andM;* 20MHz 80386 CPUandM;* 3COM 3C523 MCA Ethernet adaptorandM;* 3+OPEN Version 1.1andM;* OS/2 PM Standard Edition version 1.1andM;* 120Mb hard diskandM;* 6Mb RAMandM;* Price 4,844 pounds plus VATandM;Mitac MiStation 2 (DOS workstation)andM;* 12MHz 286 CPUandM;* 3COM 3C503 16-bit Ethernet cardandM;* DOS 4.01andM;* 40Mb hard diskandM;* 4Mb RAMandM;* Price 1,399 poundsandM;All machines are lined with thin cable 'cheaper net'.andM;PC User LAN benchmarksandM;There are at least two ways to measure LAN performance.andP;  The moststraightforward method is to line up three or four dozen workstations, wrapthem up with half a mile of cable, plug in the server and run your software.andM;That's very accurate but just a touch impractical -- imagine unboxing (andreboxing, and storing the boxes in between) that number of PCs.andP;  And imagineemploying the number of extra hands needed to get it all humming in unison.andO;This may be the way IBM does it (and Peter Home says it's the way Mitsubishidoes it) but few organizations are at leisure to approach tsting in this way.andM;The most efficient way to do it, from a material and personal resourcesaspect, is to have a workstation emulating the traffic that the 30 or 40workstations would generate, and then benchmark the effects on a measurementworkstation.andP;  You sacrifice a 1 to 1 correspondence to the real world butit's still a valid means of comparing two (or more) servers.andM;PC User, always prepared to exercise its practical software prowess insteadof just working up a sweat shifting piles and boxes, has devised just such ascheme.andP;  In this, Round 1 of the PC User LAN test, we'll pit an MCA machinewith integral Ethernet against an EISA box equipped with a Torus card, with3+OPEN and Ethernet providing the operating system and the transportrespectively.andM;In the future, we intend to have more contests: under Netware 386, LMX vsVines, with Token Ring, AT bus servers, 386 vs 486 engines, in fact with justabout any combination that makes sense and can sort out marketing hyperbolefrom the naked facts.andM;The PC User Lan benchmarks are intended to give the entire server system aworkout, not just the disk subsystem.andP;  The results will show which setupperformed best -- and if you have a duplicate system, the numbers aredirectly applicable to you.andP;  If your configuration isn't identical, theresults will be indicative, rather than definitive.andM;Eventually we intend to run these tests on various network adaptors, to findthe best EISA Ethernet card, for example, or compare drives with ESDI vs SCSIinterfaces.andP;  Watch this space.andM;All the following tests are run in order to produce three timings, whererelevant and practical.andP;  First the test is run on the server as a stand-alonemachine.andP;  Then the test is run from a workstation with and without anotherworkstation in order to create substantial network traffic.andM;We have an OS/2 program called NETDISK that generates the network trafficnecessary to simulate a large number of workstations.andP;  It's run from theModel 70 OS/2 workstation against a directory on the server, creating a largefile in the process.andP;  The program then does reads and writes against thefile.andP;  A timed loop provides a given level of pressure that can be setaccording to the number of Kbs per second the setup can support withoutugliness.andP;  In the first go, give Presentation Manager windows will be runningNETDISK sessions and the benchmark timings will be done of a MitacMiStation2.andM;Here's how the test workandM;* Tests 1 and 2 are the same as our current single-user benchmarks, usingParadox to export a delimited ASCII file and import a dBase file.andM;* Tests 3 and 4 use a program called MAKPART.andP;  It creates a set ofdirectories and subdirectories that contain random numbers of random sizedfiles.andP;  Breaking with PC User tradition, this is a self-timed test but,conservative souls that we are, we'll double-checks the results with astopwatch.andM;* Test 4 uses the data created in Test 3 and MCOPY's it on to theworkstation's hard disk.andM;(The last three tests are run in a fixed order using, in this case,Ashton-Tate's SQL Server.andP;  A PC User program called MAKTSDB generates anASCII delimited file of approximately 20Mb with 160,000 rows.)andM;* Test 5 does a seleccion of a small number of rows in the database.andM;* Test 6 makes changes in a specified field in rows meeting a selectioncriterion.andM;* Test 7 fetches the last row of the table.andM;It's not really apparent how many workstations are simulated with NETDISKand, for the approximately narrow purposes of these comparisons, it'sirrelevant.andP;  Suffice is to say that loaded, in NETDISK terms, reflects agreat deal of network traffic.andP;  What counts is the relative performance ofthe two systems under test.andM;Buying sophisticated PCs is a complicated exercise.andP;  In addition to capacityand service requirements, speed is the factor that everyone zooms in on.andM;With this new series of PC User LAN benchmarks, you'll be in an excellentposition to maxximize the performance of your server purchases in the sameway that our PC benchmarks have helped sort our desktop PC power in the past.andM;And that's the scene set for the inaugural PC User LAN benchmarks.andP;  Inbetween now and next issue we'll be reviewing the performance of both MCA andEISA machines, and will deliver the results in full next issue.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
