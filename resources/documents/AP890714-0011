The sources, who asked not to be identified by name, said DeborahGore Dean has told congressional investigators she can testify thatPierce ordered funding for specific projects under the Section 8Moderate Rehabilitation program.   The program was briefly suspended after HUD auditors criticizedthe selection process and said a number of prominent Republicans hadbeen able to steer millions of dollars to their clients.   The sources said Ms. Dean demanded immunity from prosecution inexchange for answering questions from the House subcommitteeinvestigating abuses at HUD during Pierce's eight-year tenure assecretary.   One source said she told the committee that she could testifythat Pierce personally ordered funding for ``numerous'' projects.The source declined to be more specific.   A congressional source said Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif.,chairman of the subcommittee, was considering such a deal ``with anopen mind'' but had not made a decision.   Ms. Dean earlier refused to testify, citing her Fifth Amendmentrights against self-incrimination. She spent three years as Pierce'sexecutive assistant, and has been described by former colleagues aswielding great influence.   Pierce told the subcommittee last month he had no direct role infunding decisions in the Section 8 or any other program. Since then,however, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Pierce intervenedon behalf of several associates, including a former law partner.   Subcommittee members have told Pierce, who moved back toManhattan to resume his law and business dealings, that they want toquestion him again.   Word on the negotiations between congressional investigators andMs. Dean came as HUD officials more than doubled _ to $1.1 billion _their estimate of the losses in one program suspended because ofscandals plaguing the agency.   The Washington Post said in Friday's editions that HUD hiredattorney Peter E. Novick to head a program that three years earlierhad losses estimated at nearly $240,000 because Novick made falsestatements working as a settlement attorney in real estatetransactions.   Novick, 47, pleaded guilty May 25 in U.S. District Court to onecount of making a false statement, and has been ordered to report inmid-August to a halfway house to serve a one-year sentence. However,a memorandum filed earlier this year in court by federal prosecutorssaid Novick made false statements in 18 separate real estatetransactions from 1982 to 1984, the newspaper said.   Novick was rehired by HUD in February 1987 after talking withThomas Demery, the assistant secretary for housing during the laterpart of the Reagan administration.   The Senate Banking Committee also voted to launch its owninvestigation into HUD operations during the Reagan administration,joining the two House panels already scrutinizing allegations ofmismanagement, fraud and influence-peddling at themultibillion-dollar agency.   The Senate committee said one of its priorities would be a reviewof a co-insurance program under HUD's Federal HousingAdministration, the subject of a new audit that estimates losses atmore than double the earlier $452 million figure.   The $1.1 billion estimate was based on the audit and informationcompiled by FHA officials, according to a ranking HUD official whospoke on condition of anonymity.   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp was aware of the estimate Tuesday when hegave Congress a $2 billion ``ballpark'' figure as the cost of HUDmismanagement during the Reagan years, the official said.   Ms. Dean's testimony would mark a dramatic turn in theinvestigation, which so far far has centered on influence-peddlingon the Section 8 program, suspected abuses of the $5 billionco-insurance program and lax agency management that allowed privateclosing agents hired by HUD to withhold millions of dollars owed thegovernment.   Kemp, who has suspended or canceled three programs and orderedinternal reviews of virtually all the agency's housing programs, hasvowed to clean up the department that he took over last winter.   In other developments:   _Black, Manafort, Stone andamp; Kelly, a leading GOP consulting companylinked to influence-peddling at HUD, disclosed far broader dealingson HUD-related work than had been described by one of its principalmembers in recent testimony to Congress.   Paul Manafort testified before the employment and housingsubcommittee last month that his company had lobbied HUD for twoclients. However, Lantos released a memo from Manafort saying thatfurther review found the company had lobbied HUD for several otherclients.   _Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Mich., chairman of the House appropriationssubcommitee, said its decision not to provide new funding for theSection 8 program wasn't irreversible, but that Congress neededassurances influence-peddling has been eliminated.   _The Senate Banking Committee approved and sent to the fullSenate the nomination of Francis A. Keating II as HUD's generalcounsel, a post that will have a key role in agency dealings withinvestigations by law enforcement agencies.   The co-insurance program under investigation was among those Kempsuspended. The FBI is investigating the largest private lender underthe program, DRG Funding Corp.   The New York Times reported Thursday that the FBI probe hasexpanded to include a review of company ties with Demery, the formerassistant secretary for housing. Demery oversaw the co-insuranceprogram.   Demery, in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, saidhe believed documents seized by the FBI from DRG's offices likelyincluded official correspondence with his office at HUD.   ``There's nothing that would look suspect,'' Demery said. ``Therewould be routine correspondence from time to time between my officeand DRG.''   Demery said he hadn't been contacted by the FBI. An agencyspokeswoman said she could neither confirm not deny that Demery'sactions were a part of the DRG investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
