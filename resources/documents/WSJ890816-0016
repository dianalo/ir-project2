In an open letter to United pilots, Frederick Dubinsky displayed a chilly attitude toward Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis, who has offered $5.4 billion for the nation's second-largest airline company.    Without mentioning Mr. Davis by name, Mr. Dubinsky warned that outside bidders are likely to propose a leveraged buy-out that could require not only labor concessions, but also asset stripping, service cutbacks, and a curtailment of United's growth plans.    United, which last week announced it would consider all its options in response to the Davis bid, has scheduled another special board meeting for tomorrow afternoon.    Release of the letter yesterday followed the disclosure that the pilots union has held talks with United management on a new contract and possible employee ownership. The talks could lead to a labor-management buy-out or recapitalization of United's parent, UAL Corp.    People familiar with the situation, who asked to remain unidentified, also confirmed what Mr. Dubinsky only hinted at publicly: that the pilots are prepared to cooperate with UAL management, led by Chairman Stephen Wolf, in a transaction.    Mr. Davis had no comment on either the pilot letter or the labor-management talks. Despite the pilots' coolness, Mr. Davis has so far tried to avoid any moves that could be interpreted as hostile.    But the possibility that the pilots might side with management, handicapping outside bidders, cooled some traders' enthusiasm for UAL stock yesterday. It fell $4.25 to $254.25 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Mr. Dubinsky cited what he described as ill effects of high levels of indebtedness at three other airlines, Pan Am Corp., Trans World Airlines, and the Eastern Airlines unit of Texas Air Corp. He also noted the recent layoff of 1,600 employees at RJR Nabisco Inc. six months after RJR's record $25 billion LBO.    The pilots union leader, saying UAL is likely to be sold, declared, &quot;We must be prepared to participate in, and be an integral part of, any financial deal that eventually surfaces at UAL. What this also means in terms of choice is, concessions to an outsider, or investment in the airline by the employees. There is no good third choice.&quot;    By framing the union's choice in terms of concessions to an outsider or employee investment in the airline, Mr. Dubinsky appeared to be tilting against outsiders such as Mr. Davis in favor of UAL management. The pilots haven't yet arranged a meeting sought by Mr. Davis.    The reference to RJR Nabisco was a slap at another potential bidder for UAL, the LBO firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which bought RJR six months ago. &quot;Certain participants {in the RJR buy-out} became wealthier, while RJR Nabisco employees are receiving unemployment compensation,&quot; the letter said.    Mr. Dubinsky also seemed to indicate in his letter that the pilots, who tried to buy the airline on their own in 1987, want other labor groups to join them in any transaction. But getting labor unified behind any one transaction may prove difficult.    Brian M. Freeman, the adviser to the United machinists union, said he plans to meet early next week with Mr. Davis. The machinists union helped scuttle the pilots' bid two years ago for the airline and has shown no signs yet that it is willing to tack on to a bid engineered by the pilots union.    The machinists also appear far less eager to join in a transaction with Mr. Wolf than do the pilots. Louis R. Schroeder, president of the International Association of Machinists local that represents 23,000 United ground employees, said the union believes Mr. Wolf should have taken action to prevent UAL from becoming a takeover target. Mr. Dubinsky's letter made a similar point without naming Mr. Wolf.    Mr. Schroeder said that machinist union officials recommended more than a month ago that Mr. Wolf consider an Employee Stock Ownership Plan as an anti-takeover measure, around the time UAL stock began its sharp rise, but that Mr. Wolf said the company needed to keep its options open.    Mr. Schroeder also noted that other carriers took defensive measures recently as a result of the overall takeover speculation in airline stocks. He noted that the fact that two of the last three airlines that Mr. Wolf headed ended up being sold has hurt Mr. Wolf's credibility with the machinists. &quot;This guy has a track record at doing this sort of thing,&quot; Mr. Schroeder said. &quot;I used to trust him, but I don't any more.&quot;    Mr. Freeman said the machinists still may propose a recapitalization that would include an ownership stake for employees as well as a special dividend for shareholders.    Both the pilots and machinists are in a strong position to influence events. The pilots are working under an expired contract; the machinists' contract expires next month.    UAL declined to comment on the union activities. </TEXT></DOC>
