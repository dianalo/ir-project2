The Office ofthe Comptroller of the Currency adopted a final regulation similar to theFDIC's but applicable to national banks on February 10, 1988. The regulationsof both agencies also apply to U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banksthat are regulated by those agencies.This amendment to Regulation H requires a state member bank to make availableits most recent year-end Call Report together with its Call Report forthe prior year end. Alternatively, a state member bank may fulfill thedisclosure requirement of the amendment by making available: (1) Certainspecified schedules from its two most recent year-end Call Reports; (2)in the case of a bank required to file statements and reports pursuantto Regulation H, a copy of the bank's annual report to shareholders formeetings at which directors are elected; (3) copies of independently auditedfinancial statements (accompanied by a copy of the certificate or reportof the independent accountant) if they contain information comparable tothat presented in the two most recent year-end Call Report schedules specifiedfor alternative (1) above; or (4) in the case of a state member bank thatis the only bank subsidiary of a bank holding company, that is majorityowned by that bank holding company, and that has assets equal to 95 percentor more of the bank holding company's consolidated total assets, the bankholding company's annual reports filed with the SEC or, if the holdingcompany has assets of $150 million or more, certain information from itstwo most recent year-end consolidated financial statements filed with theBoard pursuant to Regulation Y.The amendment also requires state licensed agencies of foreign banks andstate licensed branches of such banks that are not insured by the FDICto make available, upon request, Schedules RAL (Assets and Liabilities),E (Deposit Liabilities and Credit Balances), and P (Other Borrowed Money)from their two most recent year-end Foreign Branch and Agency Call Reports.State member banks and Board-regulated U.S. branches and agencies of foreignbanks must inform persons receiving information pursuant to the amendmentthat the Federal Reserve System is not responsible for the accuracy orcompleteness of such information. The Board notes, however, that statemember banks are required to prepare the Call Reports by 12 U.S.C. 324and andSection; 208.10 of Regulation H (12 CFR 208.10), that U.S. branchesand agencies of foreign banks are subject to the reporting requirementsof 12 U.S.C. 3105(b), and that the filing of false reports with an agencyof the United States is a federal crime (18 U.S.C. 1001, 1005). The contentand accuracy of reports to shareholders and of audited financial statementsare adequately addressed by other federal and state laws.The purpose of the amendment is to make available to the public informationregarding the financial condition of state member banks and U.S. branchesand agencies of foreign banks. The information made available pursuantto this amendment will most likely be of particular interest to shareholdersand to persons doing business with such institutions. The amendment addressesonly the disclosure to the public of the documents identified in andSection;208.17 (d) and (e). The amendment does not address the disclosure obligationsof banks and bank holding companies under federal and state securitieslaws. The amendment is not intended to affect the legal rights of shareholdersand other persons under state and federal laws or contractual obligationsbetween banks and other persons. The amendment is also not intended tocreate a private right of action against any institution disclosing documentspursuant to this provision, and the Board has added a provision to theproposed amendment to this effect.On May 27, 1988 (53 FR 19308), the Board issued for comment the proposedamendment to Regulation H. In response to this request for comments, theBoard received 26 public comments from interested individuals and organizations.The comments the Board received on the proposed amendment were largelyunfavorable. Many commentators focused on the cost of such additional regulation,especially to small banks. The commentators argued that even if the amendmentis not in itself prohibitively expensive to small banks, the amendment,when coupled with those requirements already in effect or being implemented,would create a heavy burden on small banks. Commentators stated that thecost of compliance will put affected banks at a competitive disadvantagerelative to other financial institutions. One trade association contendedthat financial disclosures will not benefit depositors since depositorsknow that their deposits are FDIC-insured and that, in any case, regulatorsdo not allow large banks to fail. Disclosure of troubled finances of smallbanks could, however, heighten concerns of depositors whose deposits arenot completely insured.The Board does not believe that increased public access to this informationwill have such ill effects. The information required to be disclosed underthe amendment is information that is presently prepared by banks and thatis publicly available and routinely disclosed upon request pursuant tothe Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Board's regulationsimplementing that Act. The amendment simply increases the ease with whichthe public can access the information. Instead of having to locate therelevant bank regulator and ascertain the appropriate means of filing arequest for information, the public will be able to go directly to thebank for the information.The Board also believes that commentators' concerns about the burden thatthis amendment will impose, particularly on small banks, are unfounded.The Board has structured the amendment to facilitate the disclosure ofinformation that is properly in the public domain in a manner that imposesthe least possible burden on state member banks and other covered institutions.Covered institutions would not be required to prepare new reports, butonly to make available upon request reports or other financial informationthat they already prepare. State member banks presently are required topublish the balance sheet portion of their Call Reports pursuant to andSection;208.10 of Regulation H.Several commentators recommended that banks be allowed to pass reproductioncosts on to requestors of the information. The final rule clarifies theBoard's position on whether banks may charge a copying fee by requiringbanks to provide one free copy to each requestor of the document the bankhas chosen to disclose. The Board believes that providing a free copy bestcomports with the underlying principle behind the amendment, which is toprovide easy access to financial information about banks. The Board doesnot believe that the assumption of this cost will be too onerous a burdenfor banks. Limiting the number of free copies the bank must provide toone free copy per requestor ensures that no requestor can abuse this requirementby submitting requests for multiple copies. Should the reproduction costprove unexpectedly burdensome on banks, the Board would be amenable toreconsidering its position on copying fees.The amendment also requires banks and other covered institutions to notifyshareholders and the public of the availability of these reports. In thecase of shareholders, the amendment specifies that notification be madein the form of a written announcement that may be included with the noticeof the annual shareholders' meeting. In the case of the public, the amendmentdoes not specify the means to be used to provide notification, but onlyrequires that the means be ``reasonable.'' Several commentors assertedthat the cost of mailing notices to the general public may be very highand urged that the proposed amendment be revised to indicate that bankscan comply with the requirement by making the required information availableon bank premises. It is the Board's intent to be flexible on the meansa bank may choose to satisfy this notification requirement. For example,if a bank views mailing notices to all members of the community as toocostly, the bank may post a notification in its lobby. If a bank findsthat it has too great a proliferation of lobby notifications already, itmay satisfy the requirement by passing out brochures, by leaving brochuresat a convenient place in the lobby, by publication in a newspaper of generalcirculation, or by other means. In sum, the Board will view as reasonableany means that transmits to the public, particularly the public that doesbusiness with the institution, that such information is available. Thefinal rule has been modified to provide that the notification to the public,as well as the notification to shareholders, must state that one copy ofthe information is available free of charge upon request.Several commentators also expressed concern about the proposed requirementthat banks provide the information ``as soon as it becomes available.''One trade association indicated that this language might force banks torelease information before having a chance to prepare it for public release.The trade association also stated that, by requiring banks to choose whichreport to release on the basis of which report was available first, thislanguage might effectively preclude the choice the amendment provides banksabout which form of information to release. Finally, the trade associationargued that banks should be permitted to mail a disclosure statement withina reasonable time period after the information is requested to enable banksto utilize central distribution centers.The final rule has been modified to address these concerns. The final rulemakes it clear that a bank need not determine which information to releaseon the basis of which information is available first. A bank can releaseany document satisfying one of the amendment's options, so long as thebank releases the document as soon as is reasonably possible but not laterthan April 1. The Board intends the April 1 cut-off date to strike a balancebetween ensuring that banks are reasonably able to select among the disclosureoptions provided in the amendment and ensuring that the public obtainsreasonably current information regarding the bank's condition. Nothingin the final rule prevents banks from utilizing central distribution centers.One commentator stated that banks should be able to disclose additionalmaterials along with the materials the amendment requires. The Board notesthat the amendment identifies specific information that covered institutionsmust disclose. The Board has no objection to disclosure of additional informationso long as the information helps the public to understand the informationthat the bank or other covered institution is required to disclose, anddoes not mislead the public as to the financial condition of the institution.A bank could, for example, include a narrative statement describing thedisclosed items. A bank could also provide quarterly disclosures alongwith the annual disclosures required by this amendment. In addition, astate licensed agency of a foreign bank could provide information on thefinancial condition of the foreign bank.In response to a suggestion from a commentator, the Board's final ruleexempts bankers' banks from the general public disclosure requirementson the grounds that such requirements are unnecessary in light of the uniquepurpose and function of bankers' banks. Congress has recognized the uniquecharacter of bankers' banks by exempting them from the Community ReinvestmentAct's disclosure requirements. The final rule continues to require bankers'banks to comply with the shareholder disclosure requirements.One trade association suggested that the amendment carry a two-year sunsetprovision to ensure that the Board will reevaluate the proposal. The Boardregards a sunset provision as unnecessary. The Board can reexamine theamendment at any time, and interested members of the public can petitionfor reexamination at any time.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 208</ITAG>Membership, Banks, Accounting, Confidential business information, FederalReserve System, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities, Disclosuresof financial information.For the reasons set out in this notice, and pursuant to the Board's Authorityunder section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended (12 U.S.C.248), and section 7 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C.3105(b)), the Board amends 12 CFR Part 208 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 208_MEMBERSHIP OF STATE BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE FEDERAL RESERVESYSTEM</ITAG>1.
