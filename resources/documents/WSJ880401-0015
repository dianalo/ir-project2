Manuel Antonio Noriega.    The move, however, comes after several U.S. companies have already made quarterly tax payments to Gen. Noriega's regime. Those payments, which were due yesterday, provided crucial cash to the beleaguered strongman.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Americans were being asked to voluntarily deposit any tax payments, fees, rental payments or other money due to the Panamanian government into accounts that are being set up at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Companies will be eligible to receive foreign tax credits for taxes paid either to Gen. Noriega or to President Delvalle.    &quot;Should these measures prove insufficient, we will review additional legal steps that may be necessary to deny transfer of funds to the Noriega regime from U.S. companies and persons,&quot; Mr. Fitzwater said.    The move is the latest step in the U.S. effort to force Gen. Noriega from power. A White House official indicated that while sterner measures such as a trade embargo or military intervention are &quot;always options,&quot; both are still considered &quot;awfully drastic.&quot;    Separately, the Senate approved a nonbinding resolution calling on the president to block the transfer of cash or credit from U.S. corporations to the government of Panama. The Senate's action, which came before the White House announcement, merely expresses the lawmakers' position and doesn't carry the force of law.    Several U.S. companies acknowledged that they made payments recently to Gen. Noriega's regime.    In Miami, a spokeswoman for Eastern Airlines said the Texas Air Corp. unit paid the Panama government $179,000 due for February to cover such expenses as landing fees and airport rentals. &quot;It was made in cash because the banks aren't operating there,&quot; she explained. &quot;Checks can't be processed.&quot;    A Texaco Inc. spokesman in New York said, &quot;The U.S. government is fully aware of the situation and hasn't directed the company to withhold the tax revenues due to the Panama government.&quot; He said the company, which deposits excise and sales tax payments with Panama's central bank daily, has been in &quot;constant contact&quot; with the State Department.    A spokeswoman for United Brands Co., which is based in Cincinnati, said she believed the company has continued to make tax payments to Gen. Noriega, but she wasn't sure.    The U.S. plans to set up three accounts at the New York Fed. One will accept U.S. government payments, including Panama canal fees and Panamanian taxes withheld from the paychecks of federal employees in Panama. The second account will receive debt payments owed by private parties, and the third will accept tax payments from companies and individuals.    Mr. Fitzwater said the accounts will &quot;allow people to pay money they owe the people of Panama, to get credit for it with the U.S. government and to comply with the wishes of the Delvalle government.&quot; He added that &quot;we've had many companies tell us they want to do this.&quot; He had no estimate of how much money is involved, but said it is &quot;millions and millions&quot; of dollars. </TEXT></DOC>
