The construction equipment maker also said it will make&quot;important modifications&quot; in its contract proposal, and askedthe union to return to bargaining the week of Feb. 17.</LP><TEXT>   Although the Peoria, Ill., company said the dispute hasn'tyet hurt it financially, the move indicates it fears losingbusiness as inventories shrink and the economy begins torecover.   &quot;They blinked,&quot; analyst Eli Lustgarten of PaineWebber Inc.said of Caterpillar's decision.   Local UAW officials said the union's central bargainingcommittee plans to meet today in the Peoria area to discussits response. Union President Owen Bieber andSecretary-Treasurer Bill Casstevens will be in town as partof a previously planned visit to rally their members.   The company had locked out the workers at plants in Auroraand East Peoria, Ill., Nov. 7 in retaliation for a partialstrike by 2,400 UAW members that began Nov. 4. Since then,the dispute has led to layoffs of 1,600 production workers.   With the strike cutting into the pocketbooks of unionmembers, it would be hard for the UAW to reject the offer togo back to the bargaining table. Local UAW officials pointedout that, if the union isn't satisfied with Caterpillar'slatest offer, it could elect to expand the strike to otherplants. The Associated Press reported that the union'sleaders are planning to escalate the strike when the lockoutends. In a memo to Caterpillar workers, the centralbargaining committee said that, &quot;in all likelihood,&quot; it wouldelect to strike.   The UAW isn't likely to back down from its demand for a&quot;pattern&quot; agreement similar to one it achieved last year atDeere andamp; Co., the farm and construction-equipment maker.Caterpillar has been equally adamant that it wouldn't makesuch a deal.   Wayne Zimmerman, Caterpillar vice president, said at aPeoria news conference that the company is &quot;trying to breakthings loose.&quot; He declined to say whether the company isprepared to match the terms of the Deere contract.   If the company gives in, &quot;Wall Street will view the strikeas a wasted effort by Caterpillar's management,&quot; said StevenColbert, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. in SanFrancisco.   Analysts noted the dispute has enabled Caterpillar to workoff large inventories. At the same time, Caterpillar dealerssaid Friday that it's now getting more difficult to getdeliveries of new equipment. &quot;They're running out ofmachines,&quot; said one dealer.   Hurt by weak demand and big writeoffs, Caterpillar had aloss of $404 million, or $4 a share, in 1991, on sales of$10.18 billion. The company said in announcing those resultslast month that the strike had a &quot;negligible&quot; effect on itsperformance. But it said the dispute was &quot;seriously clouding&quot;its outlook for 1992.   ---   James P. Miller contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
