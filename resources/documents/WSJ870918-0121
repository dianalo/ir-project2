Some conservatives are &quot;getting very nervous,&quot; says one Reagan aide. Bork's impact on undecided Sens. Specter and DeConcini is uncertain. Hard-liners want a tougher tack. Officials' portrayals of Bork as a mainstream judge are &quot;one more indication that they want to run from Ronald Reagan's conservative beliefs,&quot; fumes Brent Bozell III, formerly of the National Conservative Foundation.    White House aides insist Bork's chances improve with each day of testimony. A full Senate vote is expected to be close. Some Reaganites predict Senate Democrats will use a filibuster to try to get White House concessions on other issues, such as Star Wars. But a filibuster to block a vote on a Supreme Court nomination could spark a public backlash against the Democrats.    The confirmation hearings, presided over by Sen. Biden, are dubbed the &quot;Bork and Windy Show.&quot;    WORRIES GROW about Aquino despite public shows of U.S. support.    A private Pentagon report to Congress about the Philippine president's problems drips with &quot;gloom and doom,&quot; a House aide says. Major concerns include Aquino's inability to discipline the fractious military and her reluctance to firmly support renewal of U.S. bases. But Pentagon officials are told to avoid downbeat public comments about Manila's affairs.    U.S. officials and lawmakers boost Aquino as the Philippines' best hope for maintaining a democracy. &quot;Even the Messiah couldn't have solved all of her problems,&quot; argues New York Rep. Solarz. The U.S. Embassy in Manila has been instructed to warn that Washington will instantly cut off aid to the Philippines if Aquino is illegally deposed.    ROBERTSON RAISES holy terror among GOP presidential hopefuls.    The TV minister's surprise win of a symbolic straw vote in Iowa convinces them that his candidacy can't be dismissed. &quot;We have all along taken Pat Robertson seriously,&quot; a Kemp aide says. Robertson sets his sights on winning a November straw poll in Florida and convention delegates in such states as Michigan, Iowa and South Carolina.    Skeptics predict Robertson will falter in bigger votes. &quot;His universe is intensely loyal, but small,&quot; says one GOP strategist. But opponents scramble to counter him. Bush forces, stunned by the Iowa straw vote, seek new ways to improve Bush's appeal to conservatives. Dole courts conservative Sen. Helms of North Carolina. Kemp hopes to gain from any move to the right.    Some Republicans worry that party fratricide will make the GOP look as divided as the Vietnam-era Democrats.    CHILD-CARE AID is pressed as a political issue. Groups representing labor, women and children open a drive for $2.5 billion in federal day-care spending. They plan a letter-writing campaign to congressional candidates and will seek support from presidential hopefuls. Day care &quot;is now a middle-class self-interest issue,&quot; says one children's advocate.    SENSITIVE REGULATORS: Federal banking officials make clear they will pay their way to an American Bankers Association outing to the Washington-Dallas football game during the bankers' Dallas convention next month. The prudence comes amid a federal inquiry into relations between thrift lobbyists and House Banking Chairman St Germain.    BLACK ELECTED OFFICIALS now total a record 6,681, up 4% from last year, according to the Joint Center for Political Studies. Included are 71 elected in places where no blacks previously held office. But blacks still hold less than 1.5% of the nation's elective offices.    GORE'S BULL wins first prize in Iowa. The bull is among the presidential hopeful's Angus cattle that received blue ribbons at the state fair during his Iowa campaigning. The Tennessee senator often enters cattle at out-of-state fairs, a press aide says, but &quot;it's not often that you travel that far.&quot;    FARM ISSUES fade as top fiscal and political concerns.    Farm-subsidy costs are shrinking faster than expected. A new Agriculture Department estimate pegs the fiscal 1987 total at $23.1 billion, down from a record $25.8 billion in 1986. Expected fiscal 1988 costs of $16 billion would be the lowest since 1984. Officials credit an improved farm economy, a farm-export rebound and paying farmers with federal surplus crops instead of cash.    The brighter picture stifles Democratic criticism of farm policies. &quot;The opposition has been totally silenced,&quot; says a Dole aide. Gephardt, who had been pushing for controls to limit farm output and raise prices, says less about the issue. Some Democrats still say subsidy payments are too big for a few large farmers, but their fervor ebbs.    Farm subsidies are still high by historical standards. &quot;We're not out of the woods yet,&quot; warns one Agriculture Department official.    MINOR MEMOS: An article in the New York newspaper Greek-American accusing Dukakis of being soft on Turkish presence in Cyprus, despite his Greek ancestry, is headlined: &quot;Dukakis Foreign Policy: Where's the Souvlaki?&quot; . . . A Justice Department team running in a Washington charity race this week called itself &quot;Legs Meeserables.&quot; . . . When the House had its class photo taken, some Democrats risked being outside camera range rather than move to empty seats on the GOP side. </TEXT></DOC>
