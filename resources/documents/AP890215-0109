Sakharov said ina letter published Wednesday he is withdrawing from the race for aterritorial seat in a new national legislature.   Sakharov's letter, published in the weekly Moscow News, said hewould not accept nominations from territorial districts because hebelieves he should represent the Academy of Sciences.   The prestigious academy, where Sakharov works as a nuclearphysicist, last month rejected proposals to throw his hat in thering as its representative in the new 2,250-seat Congress ofPeople's Deputies. The 67-year-old dean of the Soviet human rightsmovement was nominated to represent a Moscow district, but many ofhis scientific colleagues wanted him to represent them in the newcongress.   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, said he agreed.   ``I feel that I am inseparably linked with the academy, of whichI have been a member 35 years,'' Sakharov wrote. ``I have come tothe conclusion that I should be a candidate namely of the academy inthe new elections or not be one at all. Therefore, I am taking thedecision not to run anywhere except the Academy of Sciences of theU.S.S.R., withdrawing my consent to run from all territorial andnational-territorial districts which fielded my candidacy.''   In a letter accompanying Sakharov's in Moscow News, spacescientist Roald Sagdeyev said he supports his colleague's decisionand hopes the academy leadership will reverse its decision and``find a way'' to nominate Sakharov. Sagdeyev was also passed overas an academy nominee.   Sakharov is visiting Canada, where he has given conflictingsignals about whether he will continue to seek a Congress ofPeople's Deputies seat. On Sunday, he told reporters in Ottawa, ``Idon't reject the idea that I will still be a candidate in theelection.''   More than 1,000 Academy of Sciences workers rallied Feb. 2 toprotest the organization's rejection of the candidacies of Sagdeyev,Sakharov and several other prominent intellectuals. The protesterscharged that the academy leadership failed to listen to the popularwill in rejecting the nominations.</TEXT></DOC>
