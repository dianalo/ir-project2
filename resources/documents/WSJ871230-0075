Three tiny infants accounted for 10% of the cost.    The special care that saved the lives of the seriously premature babies didn't exist a decade ago. But it cost about $400,000 per child, says Carl Angel, director of compensation and employee benefits for the Boston-based hotel chain.    Faced with costs like those, companies are starting aggressive programs to tackle their costliest medical nightmares. Last January, Sheraton joined an increasingly lengthy roster of companies by instituting &quot;case management.&quot; Under the case-management approach, employers, or consultants they retain, identify medical cases likely to become expensive. Then they work with doctors, patients and family members to minimize hospital stays and find alternative treatments such as home or outpatient care or use of specialized facilities.    Depending on the company's plan, employee participation in case management may be voluntary, encouraged by incentives, or mandatory. The distinction is important because, from the patient's viewpoint, the case-management approach is full of risks. Doctors, for example, fear a reduction in care quality. &quot;Employers have no interest in this except to save money,&quot; says Francis Davis, a Shawnee, Okla., physician who is also publisher of Private Practice magazine. For their part, employees may feel pressured to accept cheaper care when their health is in serious danger.    Companies have often turned to case management following disappointments with other cost-cutting tactics, such as increasing deductibles. &quot;Companies are frustrated with the effect of their health-care cost-control programs because they haven't addressed catastrophic illness,&quot; says Thomas C. Billet, assistant vice president of Johnson andamp; Higgins, benefits consultants based in New York.    In a recent Johnson andamp; Higgins survey, 1% of employees accounted for 22% of company health-care costs and 5.6% accounted for half of these costs. Miraculous but costly new medical treatments are aggravating the problem every year.    At Sheraton, Mr. Angel says that case management has saved the ITT Corp. subsidiary about $1 million this year alone. As one example of Sheraton's savings, he cites a female employee with a severe back problem. After one doctor had recommended surgery for the woman and had told her it would take a year for her to become productive again, Sheraton brought case management into play. Under that approach, the woman was examined by a specialist in back disorders, who recommended a course of treatment including occupational therapy, exercises and certain drugs but no surgery. Following the second recommendation, the woman was back at work in 90 days, and the cost to Sheraton was $15,000 -- compared with the $95,000 estimate for the treatment that involved surgery.    Many families say case management has helped them, too, by leading them through thickets of available services. &quot;Without the help we've gotten, we just couldn't do this,&quot; says Glynis Smith, a Columbia, Tenn., bookkeeper whose son was born three months prematurely and spent eight months in a hospital. The baby's medical care was being covered by Mrs. Smith's husband's insurance plan, which called in Parkside Health Management Corp., Park Ridge, Ill., to help arrange nursing care and other services at home. &quot;These people know the resources available and they helped work out long-term plans with us,&quot; Mrs. Smith adds.    The AIDS crisis has particularly spurred companies to use case management. &quot;We realized we needed a policy on AIDS, and this caused us to develop a companywide policy on all catastrophic illness,&quot; says Victoria George, benefits specialist at the Bank of America, San Francisco. The bank says the case-management program it started last year cost about $155,000 to operate this year -- and saved $1.2 million in cases involving cancer, accidents, AIDS and other problems.    AIDS cases lend themselves to case management because home care will often suffice and patients frequently prefer it to hospitalization. &quot;With case management, the cost of an AIDS case can be as low as $30,000 to $40,000&quot; over the course of the illness, says Linda Havlin, consultant at Hewitt Associates, a benefits-consulting concern based in Lincolnshire, Ill. &quot;There has been an overreaction to how much AIDS would cost,&quot; she says, citing early reports of six-digit bills.    Intracorp., a Wayne, Pa., concern active in medical case management, says coordinated home care for a Dallas AIDS patient saved $60,000. For $30 a day, a homemaker came in the morning, AIDS volunteer groups helped in the afternoon and a lover provided evening care for the patient, who was anxious to remain at home.    Companies are also using case management, among other approaches, to attack soaring mental-health and drug-related costs. &quot;With some of our clients, mental-health care {including drug-dependency treatment} that was 15% or 20% of health-plan costs a few years ago is 40% now,&quot; says Mr. Billet of Johnson andamp; Higgins. Drug-abuse programs cost up to $18,000, and some employees enter such programs four or five times, he adds. &quot;Some companies are putting a two-time lifetime limit on treatment,&quot; he adds.    And some are calling in specialists that manage mental-health care, like Preferred Health Care Ltd., Wilton, Conn. Founded five years ago, the concern provides case management and other services for employers with a total of 4.5 million employees and dependents.    &quot;We struck a deal with a hospital chain&quot; for psychiatric care at a total cost of 15% to 30% less than regular rates, says Rick Lee, senior vice president of Preferred. In addition, the concern says it can often steer patients away from expensive treatment they don't need. &quot;The kids who used to be sent to boarding school are now sent to psychiatric hospitals,&quot; Mr. Lee says.    But the advantages of case management don't sway many doctors. Indeed, John M. Burns, vice president of health and environmental resources at Honeywell Inc., Minneapolis, and himself a physician, sees doctor resistance as an obstacle to the approach. &quot;If I am a physician with someone in a hospital on a per-diem basis, am I going to want him to go home?&quot; he asks. (Honeywell began a pilot case-management program last year, which it is currently evaluating.)    Alan R. Nelson, board chairman of the American Medical Association, says: &quot;There is a great deal of worry nationwide about the erosion of {doctors'} professional autonomy.&quot; Though data about actual practices are insufficient, the Salt Lake City physician believes case management has a &quot;worrisome&quot; potential to reduce quality of care. He adds: &quot;We intend to monitor it very closely.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
