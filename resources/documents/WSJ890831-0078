Angrist@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL><DD> 08/31/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Buying an option on a stock or stock index is often touted as a near-ideal investment: The maximum an investor can lose is limited to the cost of the option, but the returns can be many times the option's cost if the buyer has called the market correctly.    But experience shows that though option buyers sometimes win big, they don't do it often. The money-makers in options trading are those who sell them, or &quot;write&quot; them as it's known. Their winnings are never spectacular, just regular.    As might be expected, option buyers tend to be individual investors and option sellers tend to be professionals, typically floor traders and institutional investors.    An option gives its owner the right to buy or sell a specified amount of an underlying investment at a fixed price, called its strike or exercise price. Purchasers of call options will profit only if the underlying investment moves up enough to cause the option's value to exceed its cost, usually called its premium. Purchasers of put options will profit only if the underlying investment has a major decline.    Option buyers win so infrequently, says Alex Jacobson, an options specialist at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, because &quot;option buyers are betting on extraordinary events and they don't happen very often.&quot; He ruefully estimates that &quot;the game is at least 60/40 against the buyer. Over time you can't win against those odds.&quot;    Bernard Schaeffer, executive director of Investment Research Institute Inc., a Cincinnati-based market-strategy firm and publisher of investment newsletters, recently studied the returns on various option-buying strategies for the nearly 31 months ended July 21. Because options trade on more than 500 stocks it is impractical to track the performance of all equity options. So Mr. Schaeffer chose the Sandamp;P 100 index option, commonly known by its ticker symbol, OEX, as a proxy for the universe of equity options.    He also created an options-buying index, which neutralizes the effect of the OEX rising or falling by having the average option buyer each month purchase equal dollar amounts of calls and puts with the same strike price. Mr. Schaeffer stresses that his index is a measure of how option buyers do, in general, not a strategy.    Good thing it isn't. As the accompanying table shows, this approach produced a return of 4.6% over 2 1/2 years while the OEX itself rose 35.6%. The year of the crash, 1987, was the only recent exception: Investors who bought both calls and puts made 61.3% as both puts and calls showed profits at different times as the stock market first moved substantially up and then precipitously down. However, after the crash there were eight months in which buyers of both calls and puts lost money.    The extended bull market would have allowed investors who purchased calls each month to have earned 151% on their capital, making 46% in the first seven months of 1989, alone, Mr. Schaeffer's study showed. Steadfast put buyers, on the other hand, would have lost 71% of their capital since the beginning of 1987. These returns assume that an investor bought options with 10% of his portfolio's assets. In most cases when larger portions of assets were used the results were worse. Both commissions and interest on idle funds weren't included in the calculations.    Investors who used a simple trend-following rule were also able to generate profits at a rate that beat the OEX. It is assumed they bought calls when the index had risen the previous month and bought puts when it fell.    Mr. Jacobson of the CBOE says Mr. Schaeffer's study probably replicates the experience of most option buyers. Options are heavily stacked against buyers for three reasons: Options lose value as they approach expiration; about a third of all option contracts expire worthless; transaction costs amount to 7% to 10% of invested capital.    Mr. Jacobson says studies show that of every 100 trades made by individual investors, about 55 are buys, about 15 are options written against individual stocks, three are written without the writers owning the stock -- so-called naked writing -- and the balance are more esoteric trades such as spreading one option against another.    Option trading is, ignoring commissions, a zero-sum game. That means every dollar lost by option buyers shows up in the pockets of option sellers. Investors who sell call options on individual securities when they already own the securities -- so-called covered writers -- are looking to protect stocks they own against market declines and to generate additional income. Their risk is that if the stock price increases after having sold a call against it, the stock might be called away from them.    Writers of naked options take more risk. In a bull market a naked call seller might be forced to deliver stock he doesn't own; in such a case he must buy it in the market regardless of price. In a bear market a naked put writer might be forced to buy stock he doesn't want from a put owner.    How do option writers fare? To answer this question, James Yates, president of DYR Associates, a Vienna, Va., firm that provides option information to institutional investors and brokerage houses, created a portfolio of the 99 most heavily traded stocks on which options are written.    His covered writer's index measures the returns that would be generated by an investor selling calls against the stock in the portfolio. Since the beginning of 1987 that index gained 26.7% while the portfolio of stocks rose 45.9%. The reason for the poorer performance of the index is that as stock prices rose the shares against which calls were written were called away from the portfolio.    Over a longer period, the past 15 3/4 years, Mr. Yates found that the unhedged portfolio and the same portfolio with calls sold against it have had almost the same returns. However, he also found that the selling of calls reduced the risk of owning the portfolio by almost half. The risk reduction occurs because the additional income from selling the calls in effect reduces the costs of the stocks on which they are sold.    Mr. Yates also analyzed a strategy involving the selling of both puts and calls -- a trading technique known as a straddle -- against the stock in a portfolio. This approach would have returned 30.9% since the end of 1986. During the past 15 3/4 years this technique had a return 28% higher than the covered-writing strategy, the second-best technique studied.    The worst performance came from selling naked calls on the stocks in the portfolio. It produced a loss of almost 20% during the past 2 1/2 years. Mr. Yates also ignored commissions in his calculations, but unlike Mr. Schaeffer he assumed that all dividend and option income was invested in Treasury bills. At the end of each quarter, all cash was reinvested in additional portfolio holdings, against which options were written.    Harrison Roth, an options analyst at Cowen andamp; Co., New York, confirms Mr. Yates's findings. Since exchange-listed options began trading 16 years ago, &quot;it has always been the writers who have made money,&quot; he says. Of course, he acknowledges, the past few years have been great for option buyers fortunate enough to own options on takeover stocks.    ---@ How Options Buyers and Sellers Fare @ Two studies show returns of varying strategies @ Buyers    The performance of option-buying strategies from Dec. 31, 1986, to July 21, 1989 @ Options-buying index 4.6% @ Call buying 151.1 @ Put buying -71.1 @ Trend following 71.8 @ Benchmark: @ Sandamp;P 100 stock index 35.6%    Source: Investment Research Institute Inc. @ Sellers    The performance of option-selling strategies from Dec. 31, 1986, to June 30, 1989 @ Buy stock/sell straddles 30.9% @ Covered writing 26.7 @ Naked call writing -19.4 @ Buy Treasury bills/sell puts 26.7 @ Benchmark: @ Unhedged portfolio of stocks 45.9%    Source: DYR Associates Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
