(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some 1.5 million households nationwidereceived no census forms because the Census Bureau failed to printpost office box numbers on the mailings, officials said.   Each form will have to be delivered by census workers to thehomes, instead of to the boxes, before the census can be completed,Gail Kremenec, spokeswoman for the regional census office in theChicago suburb of Westchester, said Tuesday.   Officials were unable to estimate the cost of the foul-up butsaid they don't expect any significant delay in completing the 1990census.   About 106 million forms were mailed nationwide in the last weekof March. But forms destined for people who have their mail sent tobox numbers went out without the numbers, and the Postal Servicewas unable to deliver them, census officials said.   ``We're getting them back by the mailbag. It's pretty widespreadacross the country, rural and urban areas. I think we've gottenback about all we're going to get,'' said Judith Petty, chief ofthe census processing staff in Jeffersonville, Ind.   The Jeffersonville office is the clearinghouse for allundelivered census forms.   Ms. Petty said each bag must be sorted by hand and the formsredistributed to district offices so they can be delivered bycensus workers.   ``I've got about 30,000 forms to hand-deliver,'' said DonLeadill, manager of the Census Bureau's Peoria office.   The Postal Service checked the Census Bureau's mailing listsbefore distributing the forms, but the post office box problem wasnot discovered because addresses with box numbers weren't checked,Ms. Kremenec said.   Ms. Kremenec said census employees hired to do door-to-doorsurveys next month will be pressed into service to deliver theforms. ``We already have the staff on board to go to every housethat we didn't get a response from,'' she said.   However, in at least two central Illinois districts extra censusemployees will have to be hired, at $6 per hour, to deliver theforms. Leadill said he will hire people for the task, as will JerryHarder, district manager in Bloomington.   ``We have about 15,000 forms being returned to us asundeliverable,'' said Harder, whose largely rural district includes13 counties. But he said, ``We don't consider it a big problem. ...It's no big deal.''</TEXT></DOC>
