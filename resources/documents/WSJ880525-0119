The murder of a federal judge is a mind-numbing tragedy, but may signal more than just another deranged gunman. It is also a cautionary tale against further undermining the legitimacy of judges. An aggressive liberal campaign to free judges from impartial legal principles sends the message that judges base their decisions on their personal preference for who should win cases. To the extent this concept takes hold among the judiciary and public, raging resentment from losing litigants should be no surprise.    No one can know his precise motivation, but it appears that Charles Koster took Judge Richard Daronco's decision against Carolee Koster's $2.5 million sexual harassment and discrimination claim as a personal rejection, not as a judgment on the legal merits. Ms. Koster interpreted her father's action in this way. &quot;What angered him was that he felt the judge was biased against me,&quot; she told the New York Post. &quot;It made him frustrated and furious. It worked him into a frenzy.&quot; There was no evidence of any personal animus against the plaintiff. Judge Daronco had earned a strong reputation for fairness during his first year on the federal bench.    This case had been in the courts since 1981, when Ms. Koster sued her former employer, Chase Manhattan Bank, and former supervisor, Allan Ross. She claimed that she was denied a promotion after her affair with Mr. Ross ended. During the litigation, Ms. Koster fired two sets of lawyers and turned down a $300,000 settlement offer from the bank, which no doubt wanted to avoid publicity.    Sexual harassment and discrimination cases are very hard to prove. On the facts of this case, Judge Daronco ruled that &quot;there is not a scintilla of evidence&quot; that her relationship with Mr. Ross was &quot;coerced or unwanted by either party.&quot; Nor did her career at the bank suffer because of the relationship. &quot;To the contrary, she was promoted to vice president, received a three-level promotion, and was given salary increases at more frequent intervals than prior to the sexual relationship.&quot;    The Kosters are not alone in measuring a judge by who wins in his courtroom regardless of the facts and law of the particular case. This view is called judicial activism, and was validated by no less a body than the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senators tallied up who won in cases before Judge Robert Bork and savaged him for not siding often enough with the litigants of liberal choice in civil-rights cases. They pressed him repeatedly for a prior judicial commitment to vague liberal sentiments having little relationship to litigation based on a set of facts.    One additional problem with this case was that Ms. Koster argued it pro se, that is, without a lawyer. This meant there was no moderating influence to warn of the weakness of the legal case or to put the litigation in perspective. The family became obsessed. Ms. Koster wrote more than 100 motions and letters to the three judges who heard various parts of the case. The big increase in the number of such litigants in the federal courts worries one colleague of Judge Daronco's on the bench in New York. &quot;If we don't get some control over order in the court and barely competent pro se litigants,&quot; he told us, &quot;we'll have more bizarre incidents.&quot;    Prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani says threats against federal judges and prosecutors have recently increased from one a year to one a week. We doubt it's entirely coincidental that this trend developed as the perverse idea spread that judges can and do pick winners and losers at will. </TEXT></DOC>
