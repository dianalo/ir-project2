In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a Palestinan alleged to be anIsraeli collaborator was shot to death and another suspectedcollaborator died of wounds suffered earlier. At least 15Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes with soldiers.   Most of the injuries occurred when troops fired on stone-throwingprotesters at three Gaza Strip refugee camps, Arab reporters said. A12-year-old boy was reported shot in the leg when a clash eruptedafter Moslem noon prayers in the West Bank city of Hebron.   The army confirmed the two deaths and said it had reports of sixinjured. At least 365 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in therevolt.   The PLO and other Palestinians rejected a peace plan put forth byDefense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.   The plan, which government officials said was Rabin's personalidea, called for elections of Palestinian leaders in the occupiedterritories followed by direct negotiations between Israel, Jordanand the new Palestinian leadership.   It mirrors Israeli proposals dating back to 1977, which the PLOand other Palestinians have repeatedly turned down.   Rabin said the future settlement could resemble a Swiss-styleconfederation with an automomous Palestinian district within theJewish state.   He called the potential Palestinian leadership ``our partners forpeace'' but added that Israel will wait until the Palestinianuprising ends before holding elections, Israel TV reported.   Hilmi Hanoun, mayor of Tulkarem in the West Bank, said the planwas another attempt to replace the PLO with Israeli-controlledleaders.   ``We have got our leadership in the PLO and want to tell Mr.Rabin that ... if he wants peace, he knows where to go,'' saidHanoun.   In Baghdad, PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdulrahman rejected the idea ofautonomy, saying the uprising ``opened the door wide for a realpeace based on complete Israeli withdrawal ... and the establishmentof an independent Palestinian state.''   Rabin added one new detail Friday to a tougher policy againstPalestinian protesters introduced earlier in the week. Israel radioquoted him as saying troops now will be able to shoot plasticbullets at people blocking roads with stones, a favorite tactic inthe uprising.   The closure of schools for 300,000 West Bank students wasannounced by the army after an upsurge in violent protests thatauthorities say often began in schoolyards.   An official of the the West Bank military government, who spokeon condition of anonymity, said the closure was indefinite but mightbe reconsidered ``in a few days'' if protests stop.   Schools in the West Bank were closed for 10 months beforereopening in December.   The uprising is the most sustained since Israel captured the WestBank and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle Eastwar.   Most of the Palestinian victims died in clashes with soldiers,but more than a dozen have been killed as suspected collaborators byfellow Arabs.   Two deaths of alleged collaborators were reported Friday.   Ahmed Jeredat, 36, was killed by a shot in the face in the WestBank village of Atil on Thursday night and 18-year-old Mohammed Irutdied Friday of wounds suffered in a shooting Jan. 12 in the centralmarket in Nablus, Arab reporters said.   The reporters said Jeredat was a shopkeeper who cooperated withthe military government and Irut was from a family with links toIsraeli authorities in Nablus' Balata neighborhood.   Army officials confirmed Jeredat's death and listed a Palestinianfrom Balata who died of earlier wounds, but they did not have hisname.</TEXT></DOC>
