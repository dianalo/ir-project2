Instead, footstepsecho through the empty corridors as Faiza al-Matkour looksfor something to do.   Ms. Matkour, an industrial engineer, arrived for workMonday in response to a televised appeal for ministryemployees to return. She was one of three, in a section ofabout 100, who did.</LP><TEXT>   At noon, after several hours of shuffling papers, she wenthome. &quot;I will be back tomorrow,&quot; she vowed. &quot;With a book.&quot;   Almost three months after its liberation, Kuwait remains avirtual ghost country -- its leaders remote, its citizensscarce, and its economy listless. Rather than bursting intoself-sufficiency, as some here had hoped, the biggest boomseems to be in the number of gripes about the slow pace ofeconomic recovery, as well as about social and politicalreform. Postwar Kuwait, some residents fear, may be even morestagnant, vulnerable and dependent than before.   &quot;This country is totally aimless,&quot; says Abdul Aziz Sultan,chairman of the Gulf Bank, Kuwait's second largest. &quot;It'sjust swaying in the wind.&quot;   Kuwait's malaise contrasts bluntly with the success of theU.S.-driven renewal of the country's infrastructure. Roads,power and water are in good repair, and much of Iraq'ssabotage has proven superficial. Diplomats now estimate thecost of rebuilding at $5 billion to $10 billion -- one tenththe sums being bandied about just two months ago. Yet nowthat the emergency has passed, Kuwaitis still are in no hurryto pitch in. &quot;It's as if we've jump-started a car and nowcan't find the driver,&quot; says an officer with the U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers, which has led the recovery.   Kuwait's drift begins at the top. Since his return inmid-March, Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Sabah, has deliveredonly one speech, which equivocated on major issues. Always analoof figure, he has retreated from public view, andacquaintances say he appears sickly, underweight and erratic.   The emir's withdrawal has magnified the role of his cousinand alter ego, Sheik Saad al-Sabah, who as crown prince andprime minister is responsible for day-to-day running of thegovernment. Where the emir prefers simple, private pleasures,such as gardening, the crown prince loves shopping in Parisand London, and redecorating his homes with sumptuous silksand antique chandeliers. Outgoing and warm-hearted, he ismore popular than the emir. But while the emir was regardedas an intelligent and able technocrat, the crown prince isknown for his indecision, obsession with detail and, somesay, incompetence.   His appointment last month of a new government, dominatedby close relatives, confirmed Kuwaitis' worst fears about hisjudgment. &quot;It's a joke,&quot; says Sabah al-Rayes, a prominentarchitect and consulting engineer. &quot;Our lousy government wasthe cause of the Iraqi invasion, and now some of those samepeople are promoted.&quot; Mr. al-Rayes regards himself as afriend of the crown prince, for whom he has designed palatialhomes in Kuwait, Beirut and London's Belgravia Square. &quot;Butthe chaos here is pushing even a loyalist like me intoopposition,&quot; he says.   The royal family also has failed to talk tough with itssubjects, despite hopes from many of those who sufferedthrough the war that the leadership would now force thepampered citizenry to become more self-reliant.   Before Aug. 2, Kuwaitis lived in a gilded welfare society.They made up only 27% of the population, relying on outsidersto do virtually all of the gritty work. They were entitled toretirement benefits at age 40, as well as free land andinterest-free housing loans. As a result, the InteriorMinister, Sheik Ahmed al-Sabah says, Kuwaitis lacked &quot;thewill to work.&quot; One study showed government workers laboring&quot;less than two hours a day,&quot; he says.   He and other officials insist all this has changed, andthat a vigorous program of &quot;Kuwait-ization&quot; is under way. Butat the Commerce and Industry Ministry, where 80% of 1,300employees are Kuwaiti, only 100 were at their desks this week(though all continue to receive their pay). And ministriessuch as health and electricity have called back Palestinianand other foreign workers to cope with the workload. Bycontrast, the Gulf Bank trained Kuwaitis overseas during theoccupation and now 50% of its employees are Kuwaiti, comparedwith 19% in August.   &quot;People are ready to work, but they need a push, someinspiration from the top,&quot; says Sulaiman Mutawa, a formerplanning minister. He feels that liberation offered theal-Sabahs a chance to capitalize on Kuwaitis' euphoria andexhort them to greater effort. Instead, the emir askedKuwaitis to remain outside the country for 90 days, andquickly resorted to a traditional policy of placating thepopulace with handouts. (In his speech, the emir forgave allconsumer loans -- to the astonishment of bankers, who weren'tconsulted, or told how or whether they would be reimbursed.)   &quot;We've dribbled away a heaven-sent opportunity to kill offthe Kuwait of Aug. 1&quot; and build a leaner, more independentsociety, Mr. Mutawa says. &quot;Now it looks as though the crisiswas just a Dracula film that scared us for a while. We didn'tlearn a thing.&quot;   The crowds that start wrapping around the Kuwait Airwaysoffice each day at 7 a.m., attest to the prevailing malaise.With the state of emergency now coming to a close, thegovernment is flying Kuwaitis home free of charge. But justas many want to fly out. In fact roughly half of the 200,000or so who endured occupation have since left, and many of thenew arrivals don't linger.   Typical is Walid al-Adasani, a car-rental agent buying aticket back to Cairo after a week's visit home. &quot;Thegovernment must hurry and bring Thai and Egyptian people tofix things up,&quot; he says. Meanwhile, he plans to summer withhis family in London. &quot;Cairo is too hot,&quot; he explains.   This lack of urgency is frustrating foreign businessmen,who now are flooding in. Even emergency work, such asmunitions disposal, is barely under way. &quot;We just can't findout who the decision-makers are, or what they want,&quot; says thepresident of one munitions disposal firm, which has been herefour weeks. Other firms have had proposals mislaid, and onlyone munitions contract has yet been signed, for a small partof the huge cleanup. Roadsides remain so dense withexplosives that all work is treacherous; bombs have killedone Army Corps contractor and blown off the arm of another.   &quot;The Kuwaitis seem to think that if they stall longenough, we'll do the cleanup for them,&quot; says an officer withthe U.S. Army's civil affairs unit. Delays also are hamperingwork in the oil fields, where firefighters have controlled100 of 500 wells but say they still desperately need cranesand backhoes that the Kuwaitis have been slow to purchase.   Kuwait officials respond that prudence, not sloth,explains the stately pace of recovery. &quot;We must do things ourown way, at the right time, at the right price,&quot; saysMinister of Electricity and Water, Ahmed al-Adsani. ManyKuwaitis say they were sold shoddy, overpriced goods duringthe oil boom of the '70s, and are in no hurry to be exploitedagain.   But the government's approach is hitting its own peoplehardest. Kuwait's once-thriving private sector is languishingbecause the government has remained silent on whether and howKuwaitis will be compensated for their losses. Populationpolicy, setting the percentages of foreign workers who willbe allowed to come back, also is unclear, making itimpossible for businessmen to judge the size of theireventual market.   Foreign businessmen also are affected. Californiaarchitect Juan Benitez had spent eight years in Kuwait andreturned here last week anticipating plenty of workrefurbishing hotels and office blocks. Instead, he says,&quot;Every time I try to hustle business, Kuwaitis say to me,`Let's forget about here and talk about prospects inCalifornia.'&quot; Many Kuwaitis want second homes in the U.S. &quot;sothey have a place to run next time,&quot; he says. Others seek asafe haven for their capital.   &quot;There's this tremendous uncertainty, as if no one'sreally sure Kuwait can put itself back together again,&quot; hesays.   For many critics, a solid economic future is inseparablefrom competent government, which to them means democracy.Unless the royal family shares power, they say, it will neverattract able deputies (many of those asked to serve in thenew government declined). And unless Kuwaitis feel they havea stake in a democratic, well-run system, they will be slowto mobilize for the formidable tasks ahead.   But the royal family isn't rushing to deliver on promisesof reform. The emir has said only that there will beparliamentary elections next year, &quot;God willing&quot; -- anindefinite timetable that alarmed democracy advocates.   A newspaper critical of the government that began printingsoon after liberation was quickly closed. The twogovernment-supported papers now available are so sycophanticthat Kuwaitis have dubbed them &quot;Jamahriya&quot; and&quot;al-Qadissiyah&quot;, after two Iraqi papers that circulated hereduring the occupation. This week, authorities detained fivemembers of a mainstream Islamic group that welcomed returningKuwaitis at the airport with blandly worded posters saying,&quot;Let's Build the New Kuwait Together.&quot;   &quot;It is a crime&quot; to put up posters without a permit,explains the interior minister, adding that &quot;everyone will bedoing it&quot; if such laws aren't enforced. &quot;When we are secure,when we've put the country together, then we can have freeexpression.&quot;   That time could be far away. The minister still fearsSaddam Hussein, saying that as soon as the Iraqi leaderrecovers his strength, &quot;he will do something to us again.&quot; OnWednesday, a rumor that 150,000 Iraqi troops were massed onthe Kuwaiti border was taken so seriously that U.S. Armyofficers had to dispel it. As for U.S. troops, the interiorminister hopes they will stay &quot;as long as they can.&quot;   Kuwait's opposition suspects the royal family is using thesecurity issue as an excuse for delaying reform. &quot;The royalfamily is playing dirty games and will keep playing them,&quot;says Imad al-Saif, a lawyer and member of a group calledDemocratic Forum. &quot;They just aren't serious about democracy.&quot;   But it also isn't clear that the opposition is seriousabout applying real pressure for change. A very loosecoalition of Islamic and secular democratic groups, theopposition is broadly united in seeking elections, a freepress and other safeguards laid out in the country's 1962constitution. But there are potentially cripplingdifferences, too.   Some groups want Islam to be the sole source of Kuwaitilaw, and won't meet in the same room with women, who areactive in other groups. And despite endless consultations atevening sessions known as diwaniyas, the opposition hasproduced little apart from a few pamphlets. Nor is it eagerto exploit the current discontent with more concerted action.   &quot;Opposition has limits in a country like this, whereeveryone lives so well,&quot; says Mohamed Hussein, a sociologyprofessor at Kuwait University. Like almost everyone else atone opposition meeting this week, he plans to go abroad forseveral months. &quot;But we will start things up again inSeptember,&quot; he says.   Such sentiments lead many to conclude that Kuwait's royalfamily will manage as always to muddle through, takingglacial steps toward reform and buying time and tolerancewith yet more handouts.   Yet Iraqi occupation has left scars that may still proveexplosive. Kuwait's citizens are heavily armed. If theauthorities become heavy-handed, as they did in tear-gassingprotesters in early 1990, embittered young Kuwaitis couldmeet force with force. There also has been no let-up in thearbitrary arrest and beating of Palestinians; and otherdisenfranchised groups, such as stateless Kuwaitis known as&quot;bidoun,&quot; are losing their jobs. Any violent incident,particularly involving Palestinians, could easily provokereprisals that spiral out of control. The start Saturday oftrials of suspected Iraqi collaborators is also likely toaggravate tension in this divided community.   &quot;If things keep drifting, Kuwait will just break down intofactions, and then we'll end up like Beirut,&quot; warns Mr.al-Rayes, the architect. Already, Kuwaitis complain of acrime wave, with mysterious men in uniform stopping cars andbreaking into homes.   And then there is simply the raw power of recent history.This week, a &quot;Torture Tools Exhibit&quot; opened here, with grislydisplays of saws, cleavers, bloodstained pillows, photos oftorture victims, and mannequins with severed breasts.University student, Ali Hussein, spent some minutes staringinto a formaldehyde jar containing bits of tendon, flesh andfingernails. For him, the lesson was clear.   &quot;This is what happens in dictatorships,&quot; he says. &quot;Withoutdemocracy, you cannot think for yourself, and fight.&quot; Hewinces as a member of the Committee for Torture Awarenessdemonstrates electric shock. &quot;We must never,&quot; he says,&quot;never, never go back to sleep again.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
