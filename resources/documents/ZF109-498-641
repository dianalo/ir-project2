The 386 SL is noted forresolving a significant development problem: the device isspecifically designed to use less power, having various built-inpower-saving features such as a 'clock' that shuts off powerconsumption when the chip is not in use.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Intel Corp.
