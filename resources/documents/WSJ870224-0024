Also buoying the dollar were purchases by speculators who were covering short, or oversold, positions established in the expectation of a weaker dollar.    Market participants expressed reluctance to establish major new positions while they assessed the outcome of the meeting in Paris among officials from the U.S., West Germany, Japan, Britain, France and Canada. They added that the release Friday of U.S. statistics for the trade balance and consumer prices in January may determine where the dollar goes next.    Some traders predicted a period of exchange-rate stability in the wake of the joint statement issued at the close of the finance officials' meeting. The ministers declared that the dollar had declined enough and that the six countries' currency values were &quot;within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals.&quot; The officials also indicated they are prepared to intervene in the currency markets to help stabilize exchange rates at &quot;about their current levels.&quot;    &quot;The market is saying, 'Okay, maybe they're right,'&quot; about the appropriateness of current exchange rates, said Paul Winchester, head of foreign exchange at National Westminster Bank PLC, London. Many traders, he added, are &quot;trying to decide whether to dive in or not&quot; following the Paris statement.    &quot;The real key is going to be the intervention and the role the Fed will play,&quot; said Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago. In order for any intervention effort to succeed in stabilizing the dollar, the Fed would have to be significantly involved, he said.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8393 marks, up 1.2% from 1.8183 Friday. The dollar rose only slightly against the Japanese unit, to 153.69 yen from 153.58.    In early Tokyo trading Tuesday, the dollar edged up to 153.85 yen.    Many dealers expect the dollar to trade within a narrow range in the near future even without central-bank support. They noted that exchange rates were relatively stable in the few weeks before the Paris meeting, which by itself didn't produce any fresh incentives for trading. &quot;We're likely to see more of this kind of action in the next few days, because there's no strong sentiment emerging about the next major direction for the dollar,&quot; said James S. Vick, a vice president and trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York.    Michael A. Gotthelf, vice president of foreign exchange at Berliner Handels andamp; Frankfurter Bank, New York, said economic fundamentals &quot;point to sideways trading for the next couple of months&quot; in the dollar. He added that the threat to U.S. banks from Latin American debt problems and the political difficulties faced by the Reagan administration may temper any dollar rally, while fear of central bank intervention may discourage any large selloff of the currency. &quot;We may have seen all of the movement for this year,&quot; with the dollar ranging between 1.75 and 1.90 marks for the remainder of 1987, he added.    Traders nonetheless tend to agree that Friday's report on U.S. merchandise trade could interrupt the current calm in the currency markets. Economists generally estimate that the trade deficit widened to $14 billion in January, from the $10.7 billion December deficit reported last month.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery fell $4 to $402.20 an ounce in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.6 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $402.35 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                     CURRENCY RATES                        New York    Home Mkt.
