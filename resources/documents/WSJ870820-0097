CalFed said a charge of $8.9 million made net income $39.3 million, or $1.57 a share, from previously reported net of $48.2 million, or $1.92 a share. Restated net for the six months was $84.6 million, or $3.38 a share, compared with $93.5 million, or $3.73 a share. On a fully diluted basis, restated per-share earnings were $1.43 for the latest quarter and $3.06 for the six months, compared with the previously reported $1.74 for the quarter and $3.37 for the half.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, CalFed closed at $34.75 a share, up 37.5 cents.    Great Western Financial Corp., Imperial Corp. of America, Great American First Savings Bank and Gibraltar Financial Corp. earlier had restated earnings to reflect a lost battle with the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The four thrifts and CalFed had argued against the board's ruling that thrifts should write off their FSLIC investments in the second quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
