Husak, who resigned Sunday after swearing in a new governmentdominated by non-Communists, was picked by the Soviets to take overthe Communist Party leadership from Alexander Dubcek, the architectof the 1968 reforms crushed by Warsaw Pact tanks.   Husak replaced Dubcek on April 17, 1969, some eight months afterthe Aug. 21, 1968 Soviet-led invasion. His nearly two decades asparty chief were marked by rigid control over the arts and theharsh suppression of political dissent.   In his farewell address to the nation Saturday, he alluded tothe current criticism of that 21-year era, allowing that some ``badthings'' had occurred but sticking fast to his lifelong belief inthe Socialist creed.   ``Whatever mistakes occurred, were the mistakes of people andnot of fundamental ideas,'' he said, welcoming what he called the``renaissance'' of Socialism now underway in eastern Europe and theSoviet Union.   Husak had been five months away from the end of his third term.   He was replaced as party leader by Milos Jakes in December 1987,but retained both his seat on the ruling party Politburo and thelargely ceremonial post of president he had held since 1975.   Husak, Jakes and the other men responsible for the crackdown onreform after 1968 all lost their powerful Politburo posts Nov. 24in a purge prompted by the surging pro-democracy movement.   During the ``Prague Spring'' liberalization period, Husakclearly stood for reform, even going so far as to say just daysafter the invasion: ``I stand fully behind Dubcek's concept ...Either I shall stand with him, or I shall leave.''   But he quickly became a willing executor of the Kremlin'shardline policy.   Under continued Soviet pressure, Husak supervised a wholesalepurge of the party and a crackdown that left most of the reformmovement's brightest advocates in official disgrace and toiling inmenial jobs.   Husak was responsible for sweeping campaigns aimed at crushingpolitical dissent and the persecution of members of the Charter 77human rights movement.   Many of those early disidents, including Czechoslovakia's mostprominent opposition leader, Vaclav Havel, have since forced theCommunists to relinquish their 41-year monopoly on power.   Opposition leaders had demanded Husak's resignation as a keystep toward genuine democratic reforms.   Husak was born Jan. 10, 1913, near Bratislava, the Slovakcapital, and trained as a lawyer. He became a Communist Partymember in 1933 and was a leading member of the Communistunderground in Slovakia during World War II.   He fell into disgrace as a Slovak nationalist during theStalinist years. He was arrested in 1951 and later sentenced tolife imprisonment for nationalist and anti-state activities.   He was released from prison in 1960, given a factory job, andwas later rehabilitated.   Under Husak, Czechoslovakia gained a reputation as one of theSoviet Union's most unswerving political allies in the Warsaw Pact.   His political career became endangered when Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev instituted reforms from the Kremlin, andneighboring Poland and Hungary followed suit.   Early in 1987, after Gorbachev outlined a sweeping program ofpolitical change in January that year, Husak switched tactics andlent verbal support to reforms.   But that was not enough to save him the party leadership. In thehandover to Jakes, reformers hoped that change would come.   But Jakes became what Valtr Komarek, a reform-minded economisttapped as a probable member of the new government, calls a tool ofthe ``Mafia'' picked by the Soviets to run Czechoslovakia in 1968,and in the end appeared even more resistant to change than Husak.</TEXT></DOC>
