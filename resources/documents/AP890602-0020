(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sperm cells can be used to introduceforeign genes into animals, a discovery that could make it mucheasier to produce genetically engineered animals, according to astudy published today.   A team led by Dr. C. Spadafora at the Institute of BiomedicalTechnology in Rome reported that mouse sperm cells incubated in asolution with segments of foreign DNA could capture the DNAmolecules.   In the experiment, these spermatozoa then were used to fertilizemouse eggs in vitro. Many of the newly born mice incorporated theforeign DNA into their genetic material, the doctors wrote in theJune issue of journal Cell.   Of 250 mice, 30 percent showed evidence of the foreign DNA.   DNA, an essential component of all living matter, contains thebody's genetic code and transmits its hereditary pattern.   The scientists also did comparable experiments with frogs andsea urchins, indicating that the ability of sperm to captureforeign DNA is widespread among species.   The production of transgenic animals, or those carrying aforeign gene, had previously been accomplished only by injectingDNA into single-celled embryos.   The researchers said the results suggest broad applications forthe use of sperm in producing many types of genetically engineeredanimals. The findings also imply that sperm could be a naturalpoint of entry for foreign DNA, which has possible implications forevolution and the transmission for disease, the journal said.   ``If confirmed by others, this publication will be a cornerstonein biology,'' Max Birnstiel of the Research Institute of MolecularPathology in Vienna wrote in an accompanying editorial.   Birnstiel said the research is important ``not only because thetechnique promises to do away with the laborious and technicallydemanding needle work for producing transgenic animals, but alsobecause of its potential usefulness for introducing commerciallyimportant features into such animal species that have so far proveddifficult to deal with or refractory to present day technology.''   Until now, gene transplantation in animals has been used mainlyto create special breeds for research into diseases such as cancerand AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
