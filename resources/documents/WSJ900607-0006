The privatization will occur in two stages, beginning in afew weeks with a call for bids from prospective operatinggroups, according to Jacques Rogozinski, the Mexican financeministry official overseeing the sale. Analysts say Mexico islooking for a consortium that includes Mexican investors andat least one foreign telephone operating company, withMexicans required by law to have majority control. Mexico hasretained Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. to aid in the selection of theoperating group.</LP><TEXT>   After selling a stake directly to the operatingconsortium, the government will unload the remainder of itsTelmex shares later this year, either through a publicoffering on Mexican and foreign stock markets or through adebt-for-equity swap. &quot;We're hearing different proposals,&quot;says Mr. Rogozinski.   Mexican officials and U.S. analysts see a potentialproblem for some prospective American buyers: The consentdecree that broke up the Bell System restricts the sevenindependent Bell holding companies from offering longdistance service within the U.S. outside each company'sparticular region. Thus, some telecommunications lawyers say,a Bell company that bought into Telmex would violate thedecree, because Telmex carries long-distance traffic betweenMexico and all regions of the U.S.   A spokesman for Denver-based U S West Inc. said itslawyers concluded that a Bell company and its partners &quot;wouldhave to structure a deal so that any revenue for calls to andfrom the U.S. wouldn't be a part of any interest the Bellcompany had.&quot; Or, analysts say, a Bell company interested inTelmex could seek a waiver from the court administering theBell breakup. Lawyers say the consent decree wouldn'tprohibit a Bell company from participating in long-distanceservice within Mexico or between Mexico and any country otherthan the U.S.   In any case, the decree is definitely weighing on the mindof Mr. Rogozinski: &quot;Supposedly, it limits and creates lots ofproblems for the Bells,&quot; he says.   Other analysts are more concerned about the fact that aslew of governments, from Puerto Rico to New Zealand, haveeither privatized telephone companies or are talking aboutit. &quot;Mexico has a lot of competition,&quot; for investmentdollars, says Frank Governali, a telecommunications analystat First Boston Corp.   Mr. Rogozinski argues that Telmex presents unmatchedopportunities. Mexico has fewer than 10 telephones for every100 inhabitants, one of the lowest ratios in the world. Theprobability of a free-trade agreement between Mexico and theU.S., he says, portends a boom in demand. &quot;It's a very goodinvestment and the markets are showing that,&quot; he adds.Telmex's American depositary receipts are trading at $1.25,up from this year's low of 87 cents. And recently Telmex hasaccounted for a huge 20% of the volume of the booming Mexicanstock market.   The government has spent recent months sprucing up thecompany's operations and balance sheet. It has revamped thetariff structure to reduce subsidies, overhauled inefficientsubcontracting procedures, eliminated some union perquisites,and reduced the company's debt. Analysts had projected thatTelemex might have net income of $1 billion in 1990. &quot;Itseems like we're going to go over that a little bit,&quot; saysMr. Rogozinski.   The list of rumored buyers is lengthy. Mexican officialsnote that GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn., doesn't face the samerestrictions that the regional Bells do. A GTE spokesman saidthat it &quot;views with interest all privatization activityoccurring in the world.&quot; Cable andamp; Wireless PLC of London,another rumored Telmex buyer, said &quot;it's a natural that weshould look at&quot; Telmex.   Within Mexico, potential buyers include the investmenthouses Acciones y Valores de Mexico S.A. and Casa de BolsaInverlat S.A., and the Monterrey-based conglomerate GrupoAlfa S.A. The investment houses wouldn't comment. A spokesmanfor Alfa said it was making a preliminary analysis of howTelmex might fit into the company's operations.   To make the sale a smaller bite for the operating group,the government is contemplating a change in the capitalstructure of Telmex. Mr. Rogozinski said the company mightissue a new class of shares with limited voting rights. Theoperating group then would be required to acquire 51% of onlythe full-voting shares to obtain control. Foreigners would beallowed to buy as much as one-quarter of the 51% full-votingshares.   Mr. Rogozinski said the government has almost completeddrafting the operating concession, which would run for 30years and could be extended for 20 years. Major featuresinclude:   -- Domestic and international long-distance, currently themost lucrative part of the company, would be opened tocompetition in 1994. That would give the new operator time tophase out the subsidy in local service.   --The operating group would be able to create regionalaffiliates, similar to the regional Bells. &quot;If they want tosubsidiarize, to make it regional, they'll be able to do lotsof different things,&quot; says Mr. Rogozinski. For instance,&quot;they can create a regional in Monterrey and get a partnerthere, but they cannot sell to {the partner} because all theshares are going to be frozen&quot; for five years after theprivatization.   -- The operating consortium must undertake an expansionprogram ensuring annual growth in lines of 12%.</TEXT></DOC>
