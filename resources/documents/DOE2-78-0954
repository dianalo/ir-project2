<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0954 </DOCNO><TEXT>Since May 1985, the Magnetic Measurements Engineering Group at LBL hasmeasured and sorted a total of 3834 permanent magnet blocks. These magneticblocks have been used in the construction of various successful beam-lineelements including dipoles, quadrupoles, and wigglers. The authors reporton observed variations in magnetic moments among blocks supplied by fivemanufacturers, describe the operational capabilities (accuracy, precision,and resolution) of the LBL Magnetic-moment Measurement and Sorting System(MMSS), cite the results of comparative calibrations by permanent-magnetmanufacturers and other National Laboratories, and suggest criteria forautomating the MMSS for measuring the large number of permanent-magnetblocks required for the insertion devices for the projected LBL 1-2 GeVSynchrotron Radiation Source.</TEXT></DOC>
