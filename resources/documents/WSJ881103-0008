In its latest measure of the nation's output for each hour worked, the Labor Department said production rose at a 2.8% annual rate while hours worked increased only by a 1.5% annual rate. In the second quarter, output grew at a revised 4% annual rate and hours worked increased at a 6.6% annual rate.    &quot;The increase in productivity reflected a greater slowing in the growth of hours than of output,&quot; the department said.    The department also revised its estimate of the second-quarter decline in productivity to a 2.4% annual rate from 1.4%.    &quot;The report is a disappointment,&quot; said Lawrence Chimerine of WEFA Group, an economics research firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. &quot;The economy has done well but productivity continues to increase at less than 1% for the year. We're stuck with stagnant real income and competitiveness problems in international markets unless productivity improves.&quot;    Though the report indicates inflationary pressures are building up at a slower pace than in the previous quarter, economists said the threat of higher inflation in the coming months was still strong. Unit labor costs increased at a 4% annual rate in the third quarter compared with a 6.8% annual rate of increase in the second quarter.    Hourly compensation increased at a 5.4% annual rate in the third quarter after rising at a 4.2% annual pace in the second quarter. After accounting for inflation, compensation rose at a 0.6% annual rate following a decline at a 0.5% pace in the second quarter.    The productivity report is in step with the slower estimate for overall economic growth in the third quarter released last week by the Commerce Department. The department said the gross national product -- the total output of goods and services -- increased at a 2.2% annual rate in the third period compared with a 3% rate in the previous quarter.    Samuel Kahan, economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., Chicago, said, &quot;If the economy continues chugging along on its current pace and productivity doesn't improve, the burden will be increasing labor costs.&quot;    Manufacturing productivity increased at a 4.3% annual rate in the third quarter as output rose 6.5% and hours worked increased only 2.1%. Economists said this reflects a slower pace of hiring. In the previous quarter, manufacturing productivity grew at a revised 3.7% annual rate. Manufacturing accounts for about a quarter of the nation's economic activity.    Hourly compensation in manufacturing rose at a 4.6% annual rate in nominal terms, but after accounting for inflation dropped at a 0.1% rate. &quot;Real hourly compensation has declined in six of the past seven quarters,&quot; the Labor Department said. In the second quarter, the nominal increase was at a 3% annual rate, but inflation adjustment produced a drop at a 1.7% annual rate. Unit labor costs in the third quarter were up at a 0.3% annual rate.    Productivity in the whole business sector rose at a 1% annual rate in the third quarter compared with a second-quarter revised decline of 3.4%.    All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations. </TEXT></DOC>
