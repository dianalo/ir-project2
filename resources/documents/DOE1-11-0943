The R/D were performed on the following items: (1)Study on large size a-Si film formation process (2) Study on a largesize and low cost transparent electrode formation process (3) Study onlarge size cells (4) Study on evaluation technology. As a result of thesestudies, following findings were obtained with priority given to highefficiency technology: Improvements for higher efficiency were centeredaround the device technology such as development of processing technologycentering around the large size a-Si film formation technology by anIVE type facility, and improvement on p/i interfacial properties. Asa result, conversion efficiencies of 11.1% for a 1 cm{sup 2} size celland 9.1% for a 100 cm{sup 2} cell were achieved. As regards the largesize cell, a design technology by distribution constant model was established,and elements were designed to give maximum output for the cell of 600cm{sup 2} and 1,200 cm{sup 2} size, and an efficiency of about 5% wasobtained. For modular design technology, a no cover glass product wasstudied. (4 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
