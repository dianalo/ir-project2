Some ProductsBought as New May Have a History---By John BusseyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RETAILING (RET) </IN><TEXT>   Not long ago, Joseph Bonistalli splurged and bought himself a new $15,000 Steinway grand piano. It was a brand name with a great history -- but, as it turned out, a piano with a past.    Mr. Bonistalli, a lawyer in Pittsburgh, soon noticed little things -- suspicious fingernail marks and scratches -- that he hadn't picked up in the store. Then the clincher: A technician sent by the store to adjust the piano casually said the job wouldn't take long, because he'd already done half the work in the previous owner's home. &quot;He assumed I knew,&quot; Mr. Bonistalli says. &quot;I almost fell over.&quot;    Mr. Bonistalli joins a long list of people who have bought something used thinking it was new. Problems occur not only at retailers but at manufacturers as well. Chrysler Corp. recently acknowledged that it sold as new thousands of cars test-driven -- sometimes hundreds of miles -- with their odometers disconnected. That earned Chrysler a federal indictment and also highlighted a thorny question for consumers: What, exactly, constitutes &quot;new,&quot; and when is a customer justified in seeking some kind of remedy for products that turn out to be used?    &quot;There aren't any national standards&quot; generally governing manufacturer tests of products, such as televisions or dishwashers, says Richard Kessel, executive director of New York's consumer protection board. He wonders whether Chrysler's troubles are &quot;the tip of the iceberg&quot; in manufacturing, so he recently asked state lawyers for a clearer definition of what makes something new.    The problem can be just as sticky at the retail level. Consider clothing shops, where merchandise is often returned. &quot;I was surprised at some of the sanctimonious attitudes toward Chrysler,&quot; says Alan G. Millstein, editor of a fashion-industry newsletter. In retailing, &quot;the consumer is really burned buying merchandise that has been sold, worn, returned and sold again.&quot;    Sometimes, the evidence is clear. In Mr. Bonistalli's case, there was visible evidence that his piano had played for someone else. Ultimately, he says, a jury in the Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County, Pa., decided that he should pay the seller, Pittsburgh's Hornes Department Store, $12,000, or $3,000 less than the original price. A spokeswoman for Hornes says, &quot;It was an inventory-control error. It should have been marked as pre-used.&quot;    The new-product pitfall is as old as the warning caveat emptor, and horror stories abound. In Texas a few years ago, the state charged a Mercedes dealer with rolling back and disconnecting odometers on new cars driven -- rather than hauled -- from ports in Florida and California. A firm related to the dealer ultimately had to pay restitution to consumers. In West Virginia this year, one consumer bought a &quot;new&quot; tanning couch that the state attorney general's office now says had been used in a tanning salon, while another bought a water bed that the state says had been well-worn as a demonstrator model.    Then there is Louis Collichio. Two years ago, looking forward to retirement, Mr. Collichio bought a yacht for more than $300,000 from Cape Island Yacht Sales in Cape May, N.J. But in his first few months with the boat, Mr. Collichio says, engines overheated, water pumps failed, carpeting proved worn and meters measuring runtime on the engines (not unlike odometers) were found to be disconnected.    Mr. Collichio claims the dealer eventually admitted to sailing the yacht to trade shows on the East Coast before selling it. He is suing Cape Island in New Jersey Superior Court for violating the state's consumer-protection law. If he had known of the yacht's alleged well-traveled history, he says, &quot;I wouldn't have bought the boat.&quot; A lawyer for Cape Island says, &quot;We categorically deny any impropriety.&quot;    The Federal Trade Commission prohibits &quot;unfair or deceptive acts or practices&quot; by merchants. State legislatures, in turn, have adopted statutes similar to the FTC's. Still, in many cases, the definition of what makes something used and what makes it new remains muddled, meaning that juries are often left to decide.    Consumer-affairs specialists, for their part, say sheer fairness defines the legal and moral issues. &quot;It's a disclosure issue through labeling, and that's a money issue for the seller,&quot; says Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a Washington consumer group. Merchants should tell consumers if a television was a demonstrator model, the experts say, or if a car was driven to the beach and back in a road test -- even if it means giving a discount.    &quot;All we're really talking about is telling people the truth,&quot; says Stephen Gardner, an official in Texas's consumer protection agency. &quot;Any use is use.&quot;    Or is it? Maytag Corp. runs all its washing machines through at least part of a cycle before shipping them and takes about 15 off the line each day for a more rigorous 24-hour test. These machines are then reinspected, and those that pass are boxed as new. Similarly, Raytheon Co.'s Amana Refrigeration unit puts a sampling of its microwave ovens through a 100-hour test run, then reinspects and sells them as new.    Many consumer activists concede that as long as factory tests are reasonable and the market value of the merchandise isn't diminished, then the product is still new. But Herschel Elkins, head of California's consumer-law section, asks, &quot;Where do you draw the line&quot; on testing? &quot;It's a really gray area.&quot;    The grayest area of all may be in the apparel business. Does it matter that a sweater is tried on in a dressing room and then put back on the rack? The experts say no, because consumers expect this in clothing shops. There are exceptions. &quot;If someone else has worn the underwear, it's used, by golly,&quot; declares Clyde Farrell, chief of the consumer protection division in Texas, and merchants agree.    But what if clothing goes home and comes back soiled? Retailers often get taken by customers who use merchandise once and return it. &quot;We have a lot of socialites who come in and say, 'I love this dress,'&quot; says Jan Eckert, director of customer relations at Henri Bendel in New York. &quot;She'll wear it to the party and we'll see it in the paper, and then she'll return it and say she didn't like it.&quot;    If returned clothing is clearly used, merchants say, they write it off as a loss. If it's only slightly soiled, though, they might clean it and put it back on the &quot;new&quot; rack. &quot;If we can return it to its original state, then we have no averse concern about returning it to the floor,&quot; says Mark Rosenfeld, president of Jacobson Stores Inc., which has retail outlets in Michigan, Ohio and Florida.    Consumer activists generally haven't pressed the issue because stricter return rules might be a bane to consumers. But they view big-ticket items, like cars, as a different case. Here, the threshold for when new becomes old -- and when consumers get enraged -- is far lower.    The Chrysler indictment has consumer-affairs groups scrambling to better understand those thresholds. The Council of Better Business Bureaus, for one, has gotten so many inquiries lately about what &quot;prior use&quot; means that it is rethinking its own standard of what makes a product new. A draft definition is more specific -- and three times longer -- than the old description. </TEXT></DOC>
