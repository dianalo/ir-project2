U.S. approval of exports to Iraq, reflecting Washington'spolicy of favoring Baghdad in the Iran-Iraq war, has been nosecret. But yesterday the Commerce Department produced forthe first time a detailed accounting of the export licensesit approved. The disclosures cover essentially all Americanshipments to Iraq except food and medicine.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. approved shipments of more than $230 million inhelicopters for the Iraqi air force, some for use by SaddamHussein and other high-ranking Iraqi officials, according totrade records released by the department. Also approved wereexports of commercial aircraft, engines and spare parts forIraqi Airways, the state airline.   But Iraq couldn't find financing for $1 billion in cargotrucks that the department authorized it to buy from theU.S., administration officials said. The Commerce Departmentwouldn't identify the American companies involved. OneAmerican auto maker, General Motors Corp., did ship about5,000 cars and a &quot;few hundred&quot; light trucks to Iraq intransactions that concluded in 1989, a GM spokesman said. Buthe said GM wasn't involved in talks to ship cargo trucks toIraq.   The records show that the so-called Iraq tilt in U.S.policy during the late 1980s was broadly supported by federalagencies. Nearly 80% of the approved licenses had theendorsement of the Defense, State and Energy departments.&quot;The Commerce Department didn't approve a single license overthe objections of another agency,&quot; a senior administrationofficial said.   The same records indicate, though, that the U.S. supportfor Baghdad wasn't open-ended. The Commerce Departmentrejected 39 license applications outright and returned 323others -- representing $442 million in potential exports --to the applicants without any action. Such returns were inmany cases a signal that U.S. authorities wouldn't authorizeshipments of U.S. products that would help Iraq develop itsown weapons, the official said.   The Commerce Department approved exports of U.S. computingequipment to several Iraqi agencies, including the StateOrganization for Oil Production, the Ministry of Planning,the University of Technology and the National ComputerCenter. U.S. officials said these sales were mostly of low-and medium-power personal computers that weren't of muchmilitary significance.   But the Iraqi Ministry of Interior received some $8.7million in U.S. computing equipment that could have been usedto tighten vigilance against foreigners suspected to beworking against Saddam Hussein's regime. Both the Defense andEnergy departments approved the sale &quot;with conditions,&quot;according to the trade records.   The Commerce and Defense departments also approved asmaller shipment of computers to the Ministry of Industry andMinerals, an ostensibly civilian agency that later wassuspected of obtaining supplies for Iraqi weapons projects.U.S. officials said they still have to determine whether anyof these shipments materially aided Iraq's invasion andoccupation of Kuwait.</TEXT></DOC>
