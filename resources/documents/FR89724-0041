Martin, Office of MigratoryBird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior,Room 634, Arlington Square, Washington, DC 20240 (703-358-1714).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) authorizes and directs theSecretary of the Interior, having due regard for the zones of temperatureand for the distribution, abundance, economic value, breeding habits, andtimes and lines of flight of migratory game birds, to determine when, towhat extent, and by what means such birds or any part, nest or egg thereofmay be taken, hunted, captured, killed, possessed, sold, purchased, shipped,carried, exported or transported. In the February 27, 1989 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 822), the Service requested proposalsfrom Indian tribes that wished to establish special migratory bird huntingregulations for the 1989-90 hunting season, under the guidelines describedin the June 4, 1985 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (at 50 FR 23467). The guidelines were developedin response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their reservedhunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority toregulate hunting by both tribal and nontribal members on their reservations.The guidelines include possibilities for: (1) On-reservation hunting byboth tribal and nontribal members, with hunting by nontribal members onsome reservations to take place within Federal frameworks but on datesdifferent from those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservationhunting by tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks forseason dates and length, and for daily bag and possession limits; and (3)off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usualframework dates and season length, with some added flexibility in dailybag and possession limits. In all cases, the regulations established underthe guidelines would have to be consistent with the March 10 to September1 closed season mandated by the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty with Canada.The guidelines are capable of application to those tribes that have recognizedreserved hunting rights on Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservationtrust lands) and on ceded lands. They also apply to establishing migratorybird hunting regulations for nontribal members on all lands within theexterior boundaries of reservations where tribes have full wildlife managementauthority over such hunting or where the tribes and affected States otherwisehave reached agreement over hunting by nontribal members on lands ownedby non-Indians within the reservation. Tribes usually have the authority to regulate migratory bird hunting bynonmembers on Indian-owned reservation lands, subjects to Service approval.The question of jurisdiction is more complex on reservations that includelands owned by non-Indians, especially when the surrounding States haveestablished or intend to establish regulations governing hunting by non-Indianson these lands. In such cases, the Service encourages the tribes and Statesto reach agreement on regulations that would apply throughout the reservations.When appropriate, the Service will consult with a tribe and State withthe aim of facilitating an accord. The Service also will consult jointlywith tribal and State officials in the affected States where tribes maywish to establish special hunting regulations for tribal members on cededlands. One of the guidelines provides for the continuation of harvest of waterfowland other migratory game birds by tribal members on reservations whereit is a customary practice. The Service does not oppose this harvest, providedit does not take place during the closed season required by the 1916 CanadianMigratory Bird Treaty, and it is not so large as to adversely affect thestatus of the migratory bird resource. Prior to the 1987-88 and 1988-89hunting seasons, the Service reached an agreement with the Mille Lacs Bandof Chippewa Indians for hunting by tribal members on their land in Minnesota.A similar agreement was reached with the Yankton Sioux Tribe in South Dakotafor the 1988-89 hunting season. The Service recently reached agreementagain with the Mille Lacs Band for the 1989-90 hunting season. Before developing the guidelines, the Service reviewed available informationon the current status of migratory bird hunting on Federal Indian reservationsand evaluated the impact that adoption of the guidelines likely would haveon migratory birds. The Service has concluded that the size of the migratorybird harvest by tribal members hunting on their reservation is too smallto have significant impacts on the migratory bird resource when comparedwith the much larger off-reservation sport harvest by non-Indians. Themajor area of concern relates to hunting seasons for nontribal memberson dates that are within Federal frameworks, but that are different fromthose established by the State(s) in which a Federal Indian reservationis located. A large influx of nontribal hunters onto a reservation at atime when the season is closed in the surrounding State(s) could resultin adverse harvest impacts on one or more migratory bird species. The guidelinesmake such an event unlikely, however, because tribal proposals must includedetails on the harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; methodsthat will be employed to measure or monitor harvest (bag checks, mail questionnaires,etc.); steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest, where it couldbe shown that failure to limit such harvest would impact seriously on themigratory bird resource; and tribal capabilities to establish and enforcemigratory bird hunting regulations. Based on a review of tribal proposals,the Service may require modifications, and regulations may be establishedexperimentally, pending evaluation and confirmation of harvest informationobtained by the tribes. The Service believes that the guidelines provide appropriate opportunityto accommodate the reserved hunting rights and management authority ofIndian tribes while ensuring that the migratory bird resource receivesnecessary protection. The conservation of this important internationalresource is paramount. The guidelines should not be viewed as inflexible.Nevertheless, the Service notes that they have been employed successfullysince 1985 to establish special hunting regulations for Indian tribes.Therefore, the Service believes they have been tested adequately and madethem final beginning with the 1988-89 hunting season. It should be stressedhere, however, that use of the guidelines is not necessary and no actionis required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations establishedby the State(s) in which the reservation is located. The Service notes that duck numbers were much smaller than usual last year,largely because of poor reproduction caused by an extended period of droughtin the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada and the United States. The droughtin 1988 was especially severe, and for conservation purposes, duck huntingregulations were restrictive during the 1988-89 hunting season. Preliminaryresults of of recent breeding population surveys indicate little overallimprovement in breeding ground conditions and duck population status, andrestrictive hunting regulations can be expected again for the 1989-90 season.<ITAG tagnum="84">Hunting Season Proposals From Indian Tribes and Organizations </ITAG>In addition to the Mille Lacs Band, the Service received requests fromten tribes and Indian organizations for special migratory bird huntingregulations for the 1989-90 hunting season. The proposed regulations for the different tribes are shown below. It shouldbe noted that this proposed rule, and a final rule to be published laterin an August 1989 <T4>Federal Register,</T4> will include tribal regulations for both earlyand late hunting seasons. The early season begins on September 1 each yearand includes species such as mourning doves and white-winged doves. Thelate season usually begins on or around October 1 and includes most waterfowlspecies. Because final regulations for Indian tribes must be establishedby September 1, the proposed and final regulations for most tribal huntingseasons are described in relation to the season dates, season length, andlimits that will be permitted when final Federal frameworks are announcedfor early and late season regulations. For example, the daily bag and possessionlimits for ducks on reservations in the Southwestern United States willbe shown as ``Same as permitted Pacific Flyway States under final Federalframeworks to be announced,'' and limits for geese will be shown as thesame that will be permitted the State(s) in which the reservations arelocated. The proposed frameworks for early season regulations are scheduledfor early July publication in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> and final Federal frameworks will be publishedin early August. Proposed late season frameworks for waterfowl and cootswill be published in mid-August, and the final Federal frameworks for thelate season will be published in a mid-September <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The Service will notify affected tribes of seasondates, bag limits, etc., as soon as final frameworks are established. Asdiscussed earlier in this document, no action is required by tribes thatwish to observe the migratory bird hunting regulations established by theState in which a reservation is located. 1. Penobscot Indian Nation, Old Town, Maine Since June 1985, the Service has approved a general migratory bird huntingseason for both Penobscot tribal members and nonmembers, under regulationsadopted by the State, and a sustenance season that applied only to tribalmembers. At the Service's request, the tribe has monitored black duck andother waterfowl harvest during each sustenance season and has confirmedthat it is negligible in size. In an April 26, 1989 proposal, the tribe again requested special regulationsfor tribal members in Penobscot Indian Territory, an area of trust landsthat includes but is much larger than the reservation. These additionallands were acquired by the tribe as a result of the 1980 Maine Indian ClaimsSettlement. The tribe proposed a 1989-90 sustenance hunting season of 76days (September 16_November 30), with a daily bag limit of 4 ducks, includingno more that 1 black duck and 2 wood ducks. The daily bag limit for geesewould include 3 Canada geese, 3 snow geese, or 3 in the aggregate. Whenthe sustenance and Maine's general waterfowl season overlap, the dailybag limit for tribal members will be only the larger of the two daily baglimits. All other Federal regulations will be observed by tribal members,except that shooting hours will be from one-half hour before sunrise toone-half hour after sunset. Nontribal members hunting on Penobscot IndianTerritory will adhere to the waterfowl hunting regulations establishedby the State of Maine. The Service notes that the regulations requested by the tribe are nearlyidentical to those established last year and proposes to approve the tribalrequest.2. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, Jicarilla Indian Reservation, Dulce, New MexicoThe Jicarilla Apache Tribe has had special migratory bird hunting regulationsfor tribal members and nonmembers since the 1986-87 hunting season. Thetribe owns all lands on the reservation and has recognized full wildlifemanagement authority. In a May 6, 1989 proposal, the tribe requested the earliest opening datepermitted Pacific Flyway States for ducks for the 1989-90 hunting seasonand a closing date of November 30, 1989. Daily bag and possession limitsalso would be the same as permitted Pacific Flyway States. The tribe requestedthat the season be closed for geese and other migratory game birds. Thetribe conducts a harvest survey each year, and the duck harvest has beensmall. The requested regulations are the same as were established last year, andthe Service proposes to approve the tribe's requests for the 1988-89 huntingseason.3. Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Indian Reservation, Fort Thompson,South Dakota The Crow Creek Indian Reservation has a checkerboard pattern of land ownership,with much of the land owned by non-Indians. In the past, the tribe hasobserved the waterfowl hunting regulations established by the State ofSouth Dakota. However, the tribe is developing a wildlife management program,and in a May 17, 1989 proposal, requested special duck hunting regulationsfor the 1989-90 hunting season. The regulations would apply to both tribalmembers and nonmembers hunting on tribal and trust lands within the externalboundaries of the reservation. The tribe requested a continuous duck season,beginning on October 21, 1989, with the maximum number of days and thesame daily bag and possession limits permitted in the Low Plains portionof South Dakota, under final Federal frameworks to be announced. The requestedhunting season dates will be within Federal frameworks, but the seasonwould open and close later than has been the case in the past. The laterseason is likely to provide more duck hunting opportunity on the reservation,but the harvest is expected to be low because of the small number of hunters.The tribe requested the same goose hunting season dates and daily bag andpossession limits as will be established by South Dakota in the MissouriRiver Zone.The Service proposes to establish the requested duck hunting regulationson an experimental basis and asks that the tribe conduct a harvest surveyto ensure that hunting activity and harvest are as low as anticipated.4. Yankton Sioux Tribe, Yankton Indian Reservation, Marty, South DakotaLast year, the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Service reached agreement onspecial Canada goose hunting regulations for tribal members hunting ontribal and trust lands during the 1988-89 hunting season. On May 22, 1989,the tribe submitted a proposal requesting special Canada goose regulationsfor both tribal members and nonmembers hunting on tribal and trust landsduring the 1989-90 hunting season. Details in the proposal were clarifiedin a June 22, 1989 telephone conversation. The tribe has requested a continuousCanada goose and White-fronted goose hunting season, beginning on October21, 1989, with the maximum number of days permitted for South Dakota'sMissouri River Zone, under final Federal frameworks to be announced. Dailybag and possession limits will be the same as permitted under Federal frameworks.Season dates and daily bag and possession limits for snow geese will bethe same as established by South Dakota. The tribe wishes to adopt theduck hunting regulations that will be established by the State for theLow Plains region. The tribe stated that the Canada goose and white-fronted goose season permittedby the regulations would begin and close two weeks later than during theusual season established by the State. The later tribal season is expectedto provide more hunting opportunity, but the harvest is expected to besmall because of the limited number of hunters. The Service proposes toapprove the tribal proposal on an experimental basis for the 1989-90 huntingseason, with a requirement that the tribe conduct a survey to measure theharvest of Canada and White-fronted geese by tribal members and nonmembers.5. White Mountain Apache Tribe, Fort Apache Indian Reservation, Whiteriver,Arizona The White Mountain Apache Tribe owns all reservation lands, and the tribehas recognized full wildlife management authority. In a May 26, 1989 letter,the tribe requested a continuous waterfowl hunting season for 1989-90,with the latest closing date and longest season permitted under final Federalframeworks to be announced. The tribe requested the same daily bag andpossession limits for ducks permitted Pacific Flyways States and the samebag and possession limits permitted Arizona for geese. Season dates andbag and possession limits for band-tailed pigeons and mourning doves willbe the same as established by Arizona under final Federal frameworks. Theregulations will apply both to tribal members and nonmembers. The regulations requested by the tribe are the same as were approved lastyear, and the Service proposes to establish them again for the 1989-90hunting season.6. Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, Fort Hall Indian Reservation, Fort Hall, IdahoAlmost all of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation is tribally-owned. The tribesclaim full wildlife management authority throughout the reservation, butthe Idaho Fish and Game Department has disputed tribal jurisdiction, especiallyfor hunting by nontribal members on reservation lands owned by non-Indians.As a compromise, since 1985, the Service has established the same waterfowlhunting regulations on the reservation and in a surrounding off-reservationstate zone. The regulations were requested by the tribes and provided fordifferent season dates than in the remainder of the State. The Serviceagreed to the season dates because it seemed likely that they would providesome additional protection to mallards and pintails, and the State concurredwith the zoning arrangement. The Service has no objection to the State'suse of this zone again in the 1989-90 hunting season, provided the duckand goose hunting season dates are the same as on the reservation. Forthe 1989-90 hunting season, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes have requesteda continuous duck season, beginning on October 14, 1989, with the maximumnumber of days and the same daily bag and possession limits permitted PacificFlyway States, under final Federal frameworks to be announced. Coot andsnipe season dates will be the same as for ducks, with the same daily bagand possession limits permitted Pacific Flyway States. The tribes requesteda continuous goose season, beginning on October 14, 1989, with the maximumnumber of days and the same daily bag and possession limits permitted Idahounder Federal frameworks. The Service notes that the requested regulations are nearly the same asthose approved last year and proposes to approve the tribe's request forthe 1989-90 hunting season.7. Colorado River Indian Tribes, Colorado River Indian Reservation, Parker,Arizona The Colorado River Indian Reservation is located in Arizona and California.The tribes own almost all lands on the reservation, and they have fullwildlife management authority. Beginning with the 1985 hunting season,the Service, as requested by the tribes, has established the same migratorybird hunting regulations on the reservation as in the Colorado River Zonein California. In a June 2, 1989 proposal, the tribes requested the same regulations thatwere approved last year. As discussed earlier, the population status ofducks continues to be insecure. Consequently, while the regulations frameworksfor ducks have not been announced, it is likely that restrictive regulationswill be necessary for the 1989-90 hunting season. Therefore, the Serviceproposes to establish the same migratory bird hunting regulations on thereservation as will be established for California's Colorado River Zone.As in the past, the regulations will apply both to tribal members and nonmembers.8. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, Flathead Indian Reservation,Pablo, Montana During the past two years, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribesand the State of Montana entered into cooperative agreements for the regulationof hunting on the Flathead Indian Reservation. By mutual agreement, waterfowlhunting regulations on the reservation were the same as established forthe Pacific Flyway portion of Montana and included provision for the customaryearly closure of the goose season on a portion of the reservation. In a June 2, 1989 proposal, the tribes again requested that the Serviceapprove special regulations for the 1989-90 waterfowl hunting season. Asin the past, the regulations would be the same as for the Pacific Flywayportion of the State and would provide for earlier closure of goose hunting.In a covering letter, John B. Carter, Tribal Attorney, pointed out thatthe Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the State of Montana areworking toward a comprehensive and long-term agreement, but that it maynot be completed before the hunting season.The Service is pleased that the tribes and State are continuing to worktoward a lasting agreement and urges that some form of accord be reachedin time to include the 1989-90 migratory bird hunting regulations for theFlathead Indian Reservation bird hunting regulations for the Flathead IndianReservation in the final rule scheduled for publication in mid-August.9. Navajo Nation, Navajo Indian Reservation, Window Rock, Arizona Since 1985, the Service has established uniform migratory bird huntingregulations for tribal members and nonmembers on the Navajo Indian Reservation(in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah). The tribe owns almost alllands on the reservation and has full wildlife management authority. In a June 2, 1989 letter, the tribe requested and the Service proposesto establish the following regulations on the reservation for both tribaland nontribal members for the 1989-90 hunting season: A. <T3>Ducks (including Mergansers).</T3> <T3>Season Dates: </T3>Earliest opening date and longest season permittedPacific Flyway States under final Federal frameworks to be announced. <T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits: </T3>Same as permitted Pacific FlywayStates under final Federal frameworks to be announced. B. <T3>Canada Geese (season closed on other geese). </T3><T3>Season Dates: </T3>December 16-January 7. <T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits: </T3>Daily limit 2. Possession limit4. C. <T3>Coots and Common Moorhens (Gallinules).</T3> <T3>Season Dates: </T3>Same as for ducks.<T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits: </T3>Same as permitted Pacific FlywayStates under final Federal frameworks to be announced. D. <T3>Common Snipe.</T3> <T3>Season Dates: </T3>Same as for ducks. <T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits: </T3>Daily limit 8. Possession limit16.E. <T3>Band-tailed Pigeons.</T3> <T3>Season Dates: </T3>September 1-September 30. <T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits: </T3>Daily limit 5. Possession limit10.F. <T3>Mourning Doves and White-winged Doves</T3>. <T3>Season Dates: September 1-September 30.</T3> <T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits:</T3> 10 mourning and white-wing dovesin the aggregate, of which no more than 6 may be white-winged doves. Possessionlimit after opening day is 20 mourning and white-winged doves in the aggregate,of which no more than 12 may be white-winged doves. G. <T3>General Conditions:</T3> Tribal members and nonmembers will complywith all basic Federal migratory bird hunting regulations in 50 CFR Part20 regarding shooting hours and manner of taking. In addition, each waterfowlhunter 16 years of age or over must carry on his/her person a valid MigratoryBird Hunting and Conservation Stamp (Duck Stamp) signed in ink across theface. Special regulations established by the Navajo Nation also apply onthe reservation.10. Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, Odanah, WisconsinSince 1985, various bands of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indianshave exercised judicially recognized off-reservation hunting rights formigratory birds in Wisconsin. The specific regulations were establishedby the Service in consultation with the Wisconsin Department of NaturalResources and the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (whichrepresents the various bands). Beginning in 1986, the Michigan Departmentof Natural Resources agreed to accommodate a tribal season on ceded landsin the western portion of the State's Upper Peninsula, and the Serviceapproved special regulations for tribal members in both Michigan and Wisconsinduring the 1986-87, 1987-88, and 1988-89 hunting seasons. In 1987, theGreat Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission requested and the Serviceapproved special regulations to permit tribal members to hunt on cededlands in Minnesota, as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin. The States ofMichigan and Wisconsin concurred with the regulations, although Wisconsinhas raised some concerns each year. Minnesota did not concur with the regulations,stressing that the State would not recognize Chippewa Indian hunting rightsin Minnesota's treaty area until a court with jurisdiction over the Stateacknowledges and defines the extent of these rights. The Service acknowledgedthe State's concern, but pointed out that the United States Governmenthas recognized the Indian hunting rights decided in the <T3>Voigt</T3> case, and that acceptable hunting regulations have beennegotiated successfully in both Michigan and Wisconsin even though the<T3>Voigt</T3> decision did not specifically address ceded land outsideWisconsin. The Service believes that this is appropriate because the treatiesin question cover ceded lands in Michigan (and Minnesota), as well as inWisconsin. Consequently, in view of the above, and the fact that the tribalharvest was small, the Service approved special regulations for the 1987-88and 1988-89 hunting seasons on ceded lands in all three States.On June 5, 1989, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission againrequested special migratory bird hunting regulations, and copies of theproposal were mailed to officials in the affected States of Michigan, Minnesota,and Wisconsin. The proposed regulations are shown below. The only substantivechange from 1988 is a request for an earlier opening of the duck seasonin the treaty area in Minnesota and Wisconsin for the 1989-90 hunting season.In 1988, the opening date was delayed one week because of the need to providesome added protection to duck populations, whose numbers were much reducedbecause of drought. The Service believes that a final decision on the appropriateopening date of the duck season should be deferred until ongoing surveysof duck population status have been completed, a conclusion also reachedby the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission. As noted earlierin this document, preliminary survey results indicate that duck numbersremain at depressed levels, and it is likely that restrictive duck regulationswill be necessary again in the 1989-90 season.In a June 22, 1989 letter, the Michigan Department of Natural Resourcesconcurred with the proposed regulations for hunting by Chippewa Tribalmembers in the western portion of the State's Upper Peninsula. However,the State requested consultation with the Great Lakes Indian Fish and WildlifeCommission in the event that any changes in regulations are requested.The Service has received no communications regarding the proposal fromthe States of Minnesota and Wisconsin and intends to consult with Stateofficials and the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission beforepublishing a final rule in August 1989.

H. <T3>General Conditions  </T3>1. While hunting waterfowl a tribal member must carry on his/her persona valid tribal waterfowl hunting permit.  2. Tribal members will comply with all basic Federal migratory bird huntingregulations, 50 CFR Part 20, and shooting hour regulations, 50 CFR Part20, Subpart K.   3. Nontoxic shot will be required for all off-reservation hunting by tribalmembers of waterfowl, coots, moorhens, and gallinules.   4. Tribal members in each zone will comply with State regulations providingfor closed and restricted waterfowl hunting areas.   5. <T3>Wisconsin Zone</T3>   Tribal members will comply with NR 10.09 (1)(a) (2) and (3), Wis. Adm.Code (shotshells), sec. NR 10.12 (1)(C), Wis. Adm. Code (shooting fromstructures), sec. NR 10.12 (1)(g), Wis. Adm. Code (decoys), and sec. 29.27Wis. Stats. (duck blinds). The Canada goose season at Powell Marsh willbegin on September 18. A tribal quota of 25 Canada geese will be in effectuntil September 25, or until daily censuses by Great Lakes Indian Fishand Wildlife Commission or Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources employeesindicate that at least 300 Canada geese are in the area, whichever comesfirst. If the tribal quota is reached before September 25 and before 300Canada geese are present, Powell Marsh will be closed to tribal huntinguntil September 25. Thereafter, the tribal season will resume without aquota and with a daily bag limit of 3 Canada geese.   6. <T3>Minnesota Zone. </T3>Tribal members will comply with M.S. 100.29, Subd.18 (duck blinds and decoys).  7. Possession limits are applicable only to transportation and do not includebirds which are cleaned, dressed, and at a member's primary residence.For purposes of enforcing bag and possession limits, all migratory birdsin the possession or custody of tribal members on ceded lands will be consideredto have been taken on those lands unless tagged by a tribal or State conservationwarden as having been taken on-reservation. In Wisconsin, such taggingwill comply with sec. NR 19.12, Wis. Adm. Code. All migratory birds whichfall on reservation lands will not count as part of any off-reservationbag or possession limit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Invited  </ITAG>Based on the results of recently completed migratory game bird studies,and having due consideration for any data or views submitted by interestedparties, this proposed rulemaking may result in the adoption of specialhunting regulations beginning as early as September 1, 1989 on certainFederal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and ceded lands.Taking into account both reserved hunting rights and the degree to whichtribes have full wildlife management authority, the regulations for tribalor for both tribal members and nontribal members may differ from thoseestablished by States in which the reservations, off-reservation trustlands, and ceded lands are located. The regulations will specify open seasons,shooting hours, and bag and possession limits for rails, gallinules (includingmoorhen), woodcock, common snipe, band-tailed pigeons, mourning doves,white-winged doves, ducks (including mergansers), and geese. The Director intends that finally adopted rules be as responsive as possibleto all concerned interests. Therefore, he desires to obtain the commentsand suggestions on these proposals from the public, other concerned governmentalagencies, tribal and other Indian organizations, and private interests,and he will take into consideration the comments received. Such comments,and any additional information received, may lead the Director to adoptfinal regulations differing from these proposals. Special circumstances in the establishment of these regulations limit theamount of time that the Service can allow for public comments. Two considerationscompress the time in which this rulemaking process must operate: the need,on the one hand, for tribes and the Service to establish final regulationsbefore September 1, 1989, and on the other hand, the unavailability beforelate July of specific reliable data on this year's status of waterfowl.Therefore, the Service believes that to allow a comment period past August8, 1989 is contrary to the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comment Procedure</ITAG>It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practicable,to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.Accordingly, interested persons may participate by submitting written commentsto the Director, (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Departmentof the Interior, Room 634, Arlington Square, Washington, DC 20240. Commentsreceived will be available for public inspection during normal businesshours at the Service's Office of Migratory Bird Management in Room 634,Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203.All relevant comments on the proposals received no later than August 8,1989 will be considered. <ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Consideration </ITAG>The ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual RegulationsPermitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FES-75-74)'' was filedwith the Council on Environmental Quality on June 6, 1975, and notice ofavailability was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 13, 1975, (40 FR 25241).

This proposed rule wassent to all affected tribes and to Indian organizations for comment. Thefinal rule on nontoxic shot zones for the 1988-89 hunting season was publishedon April 13, 1989 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 14814). All of the proposed hunting regulationscovered by this proposed rule are in compliance with the Service's nontoxicshot restrictions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Act Consideration </ITAG>Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act provides that, ``The Secretaryshall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programsin furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure thatany action authorized, funded or carried out * * * is not likely to jeopardizethe continued existence of any endangered species or threatened speciesor result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat* * *'' Consequently, the Service has initiated section 7 consultationunder the Endangered Species Act for the proposed hunting seasons on FederalIndian reservations and ceded lands. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12291, and the PaperworkReduction Act </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated March 27, 1989 (54 FR 12534), the Servicereported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order. These included preparinga Determination of Effects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis,and publication of a summary of the latter. These regulations have beendetermined to be major under Executive Order 12291, and they have a significanteconomic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. This determination is detailed in the aforementioned documentswhich are available on request from the Office of Migratory Bird Management,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Room 634, Arlington Square, Washington,DC 20240. As noted in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Service plans to issue its Memorandum ofLaw for migratory bird hunting regulations at the same time the first ofthe annual hunting rules is completed.
