Yet, for more than two decades,our colleges and universities have often permitted speakersto be shouted down or prevented from speaking, buildings tobe forcibly occupied and access to them denied, and variousmodes of intimidation to be employed, with much success. Mostof the time, the perpetrators, in fact, have gone unpunishedin any significant way.   Colleges and universities that permit such attacks onfreedom and take no firm and effective action to deter andpunish those who carry them out sabotage the most basiceducational freedom. To defend those freedoms is the firstobligation of anyone who claims to engage in liberaleducation.</TEXT></DOC>
