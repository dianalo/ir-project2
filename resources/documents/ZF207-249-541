 As a would-be subcontractor, MCI could not use the usual protestforums, and the Washington-based company chose to challenge the ATandamp;T victoryon regulatory grounds.andM;ATandamp;T is the only regulated long-haul carrier, and its pricing structuresfiled with the FCC generally have drawn challenges from MCI.andP;  Kansas City,Mo.-based US Sprint Communications Co., which won the smaller share of theFTS 2000 contract, by contrast is free to price its services any way itwants.andM;Pricing Under WrapsandM;There have been unconfirmed reports that ATandamp;T priced its services below thoseof US Sprint for the contract.andP;  FTS 2000 is a 10-year contract whose value islikely to be between $3 billion and $7 billion and even perhaps as much as$25 billion depending on how much of their voice, data and video servicesfederal agencies acquire under the contract.andM;MCI officials have claimed that it is not possible for a vendor to price itsFTS 2000 long-distance service below what MCI proposed and still make aprofit.andM;ATandamp;T has not yet told the FCC what price it offered GSA in its bid for thecontract.andP;  An ATandamp;T spokeswoman said the company has until Jan. 24 to discloseits pricing structure.andM;The tariff for the small DOD contract was described by ATandamp;T officials as anew tariff designed for competitively bid government services.andM;&quot;ATandamp;T will periodically file new rates and/or regulations under this tariffto provide services in accordance with awards of competitively bidgovernmental contracts,&quot; the company's filing stated.andM;Noting that the procurement of telecommunications services by the governmenthas become &quot;intensely competitive&quot; -- particularly with respect to price --the ATandamp;T document said the &quot;filing creates a new tariff pursuant to whichservices will be provided to the U.S.andP;  government in accordance with awardsof competitively bid contracts.&quot;andM;ATandamp;T further noted, &quot;Each domestic offering will be shown by ATandamp;T to recoverall relevant costs.&quot;andM;The tariff was filed in connection with a contract awarded Nov. 21 to ATandamp;T toprovide DOD installations in Hawaii with outbound domestic and internationalswitched service.andP;  The contract for what is called the Oahu Telephone SystemOutbound Calling Service is estimated at $8 million over its three-year term.andM;But MCI officials charged that ATandamp;T's newest tariff only extends to thegovernment sector the &quot;contrivances perpetrated in [ATandamp;T's] Tariff 12 and 15through which ATandamp;T has offered preferential and unreasonable rates to aparticular customer.&quot;andM;They were referring to so-called custom tariffs that ATandamp;T has offered somelarger customers such as American Express Co., E.I.andP;  Dupont de Nemours andamp; Co.andO;and also DOD, which had ATandamp;T install the Defense CommercialTelecommunications Network, an integrated voice, data and video network.andM;MCI officials said ATandamp;T had created a &quot;bogus and illegitimate&quot; classificationas a result of a tariff filing intended to cover services to the governmentas a result of competitive bidding.andP;  &quot;The commission should reject Tariff 16outright,&quot; they said.andM;Call for an InvestigationandM;If the FCC does not reject the tariff outright, it should conduct aninvestigation of the &quot;profound issues raised by ATandamp;T's proposal,&quot; the MCIofficials said.andP;  &quot;The commission should consider developing in thatinvestigation a new regulatory policy tailored to the specific circumstancesof government services,&quot; they suggested.andM;FCC regulations require the commission to rule on the filing within 90 days.andO;Any additional time the commission might need would have to be with theconsent of ATandamp;T.andP;  Unless the commission rejects the tariff, the MCI challengeis not expected to affect ATandamp;T's work on the FTS 2000 contract.andM;GSA, under pressure from ATandamp;T, at one time had to amend the FTS 2000solicitation because it was written in a way that it would have excluded avendor from offering a pricing structure based on a tariff.andP;  GSA wasconcerned that the FCC review process might hamper a carrier in deliveringprices bid in a proposal.andM;A GSA spokesman said the agency would not speculate on what might happenshould the FCC reject ATandamp;T's FTS 2000 pricing structure.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
