RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today ruled that Huntington,N.Y., officials reinforced racial segregation by confining housingfor low-income families to a predominantly non-white urban renewalarea.   By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld a ruling that could make iteasier to use a federal civil rights law to challenge communityzoning ordinances that limit low-cost housing.   But the high court, in a four-page, unsigned opinion, declined toanswer the key question posed by the case: Does a zoning regulationviolate fair housing provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 whenthere is evidence of discriminatory impact but not discriminatorymotives?   City officials conceded originally that the ``disparate impact''theory applied to the case, the justices said.   ``We are satisfied on this record that disparate impact wasshown, and that the sole justification proferred to rebut (thatargument) was inadequate,'' the high court said. ``We do not reachthe question whether that test is the appropriate one.''   Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevensdissented. They voted to hear arguments in the case to explore theissue.   A federal appeals court said statistical studies showing a zoningordinance's discriminatory effects, even if unintentional, couldestablish a violation of the 1968 law.   The alternative approach _ supported by the Reagan administrationamong others _ would require the more difficult task of proving thezoning ordinance is intentionally biased.   Administration lawyers supported the appeal by Huntingtonofficials.   ``Congress intended to require a showing of intentionaldiscrimination'' when it passed the fair housing law, JusticeDepartment lawyers said.   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last April thatHuntington's zoning ordinance perpetuated segregation by confiningto a predominantly black area subsidized apartments designed tobenefit poorer families.   ``The disproportionate harm to blacks and the segregative impacton the entire community resulting from the refusal to rezone createa strong ... showing of discriminatory effect,'' the appeals courtsaid.   The town failed to present ``bona fide and legitimatejustifications for its action'' or show there were ``no lessdiscriminatory alternatives available,'' the appeals court added.   Another New York community _ Yonkers _ has been embroiled in afight over a court order to build low- and moderate-income housing.In that case, the 2nd Circuit court ruled Yonkers acted unlawfullyby intentionally maintaining segregated housing and schools.   Huntington, a Long Island community of some 200,000 residents,has a black population of less than 3.5 percent. Most blacks live intwo neighborhoods.   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,along with a local group called Housing Help Inc., sued the town in1981 for its refusal to approve multi-family dwellings on a14.8-acre site in Greenlawn, a predominantly white hamlet ofsingle-family houses.   Housing Help Inc. proposed to build 162 federally subsidizedlow-income apartments there.   A federal judge ruled that Huntington's zoning ordinance did notviolate the 1968 federal civil rights act.   Huntington officials noted that the town has 775 low-incomehousing units and said the town has done its fair share indeveloping subsidized dwellings.   But the 2nd Circuit court said confining such apartments to theurban renewal area has a disproportionate impact on blacks.   While the appeals court acknowledged there are more poor whitesthan blacks in the community, it noted that only 7 percent of allHuntington families needed subsidized housing while 24 percent ofblack families needed such help.   Placing low-income housing in predominantly white Greenlawn willpromote integration, the 2nd Circuit court said.   The appeals court said it took the extraordinary step of orderingHuntington to approve the proposed 162-unit project because``further delay might well prove fatal'' to the plan.   The case is Huntington vs. NAACP, 87-1961.</TEXT></DOC>
