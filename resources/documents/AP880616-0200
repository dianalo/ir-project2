Camille Muller thought photos of the boy strongly resembled hergrandson, Philippe Muller, but the 13-year-old boy was locatedThursday in El Paso, an FBI spokeswoman said.   Mrs. Muller said Thursday night in Paris that she had justspoken by telephone with her son, who told her that he, herdaughter-in-law and her four grandchildren were in good health.   Since January 1987, she had not heard from her son, who runs arestaurant called ''JJ de Paris'' in El Paso.   ``The FBI arrived at the restaurant as I was talking to myson,'' Mrs. Muller said. ``For all that, the mystery of this childis not solved. I am delighted for me and I am very upset for thischild.''   Mrs. Muller said her daughter-in-law's mother in Mexico City hadbeen very ill and possibly had died. She speculated that the familycould have been on their way to Mexico City at the time of theplane crash.   Mrs. Muller's daughter-in-law, Marguerite Muller, said:   ``I saw the news last night, and they were talking about it andmy daughter Pearl and I were laughing and saying it sounds likesomething Mamie (Camille Muller) would do. But we just didn'tbelieve it could be her. She showed a picture and it didn't lookmuch like Filipito.   ``Knowing her, it sounds like something she would do ... I can'tget over it. But being so far away from (her son) and not knowinghis whereabouts, I can see where she would jump on this.''   Camille Muller contacted the U.S. Embassy in Paris Tuesday afterrecognizing the boy from pictures in a French TV news report. Shesaid her daughter in Paris also was struck by the resemblance.   On Thursday she gave the embassy a dozen family photos ofPhilippe that were forwarded to authorities in Texas.   ``The resemblance is more than passing,'' said ChristopherEnglish, chief of special consular services at the embassy, whoreceived the photos.   Since he was found last November, Mexican and U.S. authoritieshave been trying to identify the boy, nicknamed Sabat because hewas found on a Saturday _ sabado in Spanish.   Authorities don't know Sabat's real name or where he's from, butthey believe he is 7 or 8 years old. He has been staying at achild-care center in Juarez since he was found.   Sabat is deaf in his right ear and has 25 percent hearing in hisleft ear. He communicates mainly through gestures and drawings. Hispictures indicate that he survived a plane crash that killed hissister and parents.   If Sabat's relatives can't be found, he will be put up foradoption in Mexico, authorities have said.</TEXT></DOC>
