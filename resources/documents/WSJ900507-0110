Diplomats and bankers attempting to negotiate settlementswith the Soviets say the problem of payment delays, whichbegan last year, doesn't seem to be improving. Large sumshave been paid following delays in some instances, but thennew delays occur in others. Several Soviet trading firms havealso asked to reschedule their payments until as late as1993, leading to speculation that the problem may drag on andthat the organizations still don't have enough money to meetall their obligations.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's a very patchy situation,&quot; says Don Brown, commercialcounselor to the British Embassy. &quot;They seem to be makingpayments to some at the expense of others.&quot;   At least two British traders are suffering severe hardshipnow, says Mr. Brown. Another European economic counselor whodoesn't want his country identified says one company herepresents is also near collapse. And a group of minor WestGerman concerns that together are owed several hundredmillion West German marks have applied to Hermes, thegovernment's export insurance administrator, forcompensation. A spokesman for Hermes in Hamburg says requestsfor compensation have &quot;jumped dramatically&quot; in recent monthsand now amounts to a &quot;three-digit figure, in the millions.&quot;   It was also reported last week that several of Japan'smajor trading houses, including C. Itoh andamp; Co., Mitsui andamp; Co.,Mitsubishi Corp. and Nissho Iwai Co., have taken the firststeps to claim export insurance because their Soviet tradingpartners had delayed payments.   The British firms haven't yet filed any claims, but havemade numerous inquiries about how they would recoup losses,says a spokesman for the Export Credit Guarantee Department.The spokesman adds that he hopes that embarassment will drivethe Soviets to pay the bills before an avalanche of claimscomes in. Meanwhile, the department is offering advice on howpayments might be negotiated.   While initially one main trading organization forchemicals called Soyuzkhimexport was blamed for latepayments, the delays now seem to have spread to many otherindustries, including steel, machinery and technology. Thetotal amount owed has been estimated at at least $500million.   Soviet officials blame the delays on chaos resulting froma decentralization of the foreign trade system. While Sovietexports and imports used to be a simple and reliabletransaction handled through several government-run tradeorganizations, more than 12,000 enterprises now tradedirectly with the West. Many of them aren't balancing theirbooks properly and have depleted the system of currency, theofficials say.   &quot;I guess they have no money,&quot; says Boris O. Kozhevnikov,director of the law and treaty department at the USSR Chamberof Commerce and Industry.   Large delegations of European government officials havecome to Moscow in recent months to negotiate payments andavoid depleting their export insurance reserves. Later thismonth, West German ministers plan to take up the problem atthe Commission for Economic Cooperation, according toWolfgang von Lingelsheim-Seibicke, a counselor at the WestGerman embassy.   While bigger companies like the chemical concerns Du PontCo. and Hoechst AG have been annoyed by the delays and insome cases have stopped shipping goods until the payments aremade, they haven't felt the effects as severely as smallertrading firms that have a majority of their business tied upwith the Soviet Union, the diplomats say. Those smaller firmsmust pay their suppliers and the lack of payments from theSoviet side has hurt them badly.   The officials have declined to identify the companies,while the companies themselves, saying they feared angeringtheir Soviet partners, refuse to comment. By discussing thesituation, the companies would risk losing not only payments,but future business, the officials say.   ---   Timothy Aeppel in Bonn and Tim Carrington in Londoncontributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
