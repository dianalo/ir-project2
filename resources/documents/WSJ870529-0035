Thomas Small, a managing director at Bankers Trust Co. &quot;If the dollar isn't going to be a factor in determining monetary policy, the Fed could go back to its easier stance towards credit,&quot; added Mr. Small, head of government securities trading.    Treasury bond prices initially edged lower, but rebounded with some actively traded 30-year issues gaining about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate and municipal bonds also inched higher, despite a continued supply of new offerings.    Traders said one of the catalysts behind the rally was a speech yesterday by H. Robert Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors. While Mr. Heller didn't make any specific predictions about Fed policy, traders interpreted his remarks as hinting strongly that the Fed is reluctant to raise interest rates further.    &quot;Maintaining interest rates so high that capital will continue to flow into the country may prevent the trade adjustment that we all seek&quot; to reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit, Mr. Heller said at a meeting here. He also said that &quot;exclusive reliance&quot; on monetary policy wouldn't be &quot;an effective way to reduce our external imbalance.&quot; Such a policy, he warned, &quot;might place strains on our own financial markets by driving up interest rates.&quot;    Some economists say the Fed has become increasingly concerned about the economy amid signs of slowing economic growth. &quot;I continue to believe the Fed won't raise the discount rate,&quot; said Elliott Platt, a senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. The discount rate, which now stands at 5 1/2%, is the lending fee the Fed charges banks and savings institutions.    &quot;The Fed has taken some encouragement from the recent stability of the dollar and recent big declines&quot; in the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index, added Mr. Platt, director of economic research in the firm's taxable fixed-income division. &quot;Economic growth in the second quarter is likely to be close to zero, which probably has persuaded the Fed to avoid any tightening.&quot;    The credit markets also got a boost from Tokyo news reports that the Japanese government will announce today a set of measures designed to stimulate the nation's economy and ease trade friction with the U.S. and its other major trading partners. According to some reports, the government plans to increase domestic spending, cut taxes and reduce interest rates. If implemented, such measures could add further stability to the dollar.    In the meantime, some analysts say the credit markets will stage a moderate rally in the next several days. &quot;We'll see long-term Treasury bond yields fall&quot; about 0.2 percentage point &quot;within a week to roughly 8 1/2%,&quot; predicted Steven Blitz, Salomon Brothers Inc.'s bond market technician.    The bond rally yesterday was fueled heavily by the dollar's recent strength, said Keith B. Jarrett, chief economist of Technical Data International in Boston. He said continued stability of the dollar would lessen the need for any credit-tightening moves by the Federal Reserve. He also predicted that the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds &quot;will drop to around 8 1/2% soon and then hold in that neighborhood&quot; until after the summit conference in early June.    Traders also say investor demand for Treasury, municipal and corporate securities has picked up the past few days. &quot;The spate of corporate and municipal deals recently would seem to reflect some return of confidence to the market,&quot; said Mr. Small of Bankers Trust.    &quot;Nearly everything that's come in the corporate market this week is sold or pretty close to being sold,&quot; said John Griff, head of bond syndication at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Other syndicate specialists, however, said a few recent offerings -- including issues by Household Finance Corp. and Pacific Gas andamp; Electric -- encountered some investor resistance.    In yesterday's market activity, the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 rose to a price of 100 15/32 from 100 6/32 Wednesday, while the yield declined to 8.71% from 8.73%. At one stage early in the afternoon, the issue traded at about 99 3/8. The government's 8 1/2% notes due 1997 rallied to 99 23/32 from 99 18/32 Wednesday as the yield fell to 8.54% from 8.57%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 1.73 points to 1282.16. The high for the day was 1286.18, while the low was 1273.68.    Interest rates fell slightly on Treasury bills. The rate on new three-month Treasury bills declined to 5.63% bid from 5.7%, while the rate on new six-month bills declined to 6.18% bid from 6.2%.    The federal funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, hovered around 6 3/4% most of the day, averaging 6.8%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). That was down from an average of 6.97% both Wednesday and Tuesday, according to the Federal Reserve.    In the corporate new-issue market, Citicorp offered investors $250 million of notes due June 1, 1990. The offering was increased by $50 million from an initially planned $200 million. The 8 7/8% notes were priced at 99.805 to yield 8.95% by underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    The offering is Citicorp's first since it said last week it likely will incur a $2.5 billion loss in the second quarter because of a $3 billion increase in its loan-loss reserves. Although the issue was &quot;a routine financing for us, we were anxious about proving our strength&quot; in the credit markets, said Robert Butcher, deputy to the chief financial officer. &quot;We had a bit of luck with improved market conditions and the issue went better than we expected.&quot;    Other large offerings included:    --A $250 million issue of Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. first and refunding mortgage bonds, due May 1, 2020. Underwriters led by First Boston Corp. priced the 10% bonds at 98 7/8 to yield 10.12%. The bonds are rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    --A $125 million issue of Nova Scotia debentures due June, 1992. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch priced the 8 7/8% bonds at 99.55 to yield 8.988%. The bonds are rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A by Sandamp;P.    --A $75 million issue of Southtrust Corp. subordinated capital notes due June 1, 1999. Underwriters led by First Boston priced the 9.95% bonds at 99.798 to yield 9.98%. The bonds are rated single-A-2 by Moody's and single-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal market, parts of a proposed bond issue by New York City announced earlier this week were changed by the underwriting group. The size of the issue was increased slightly to around $456.8 million from $454.8 million, and yields on portions of the issue were lowered. Proceeds from the sale will be used to refund bonds sold earlier when interest rates were much higher.    Yields now range from 5.25% on bonds due 1988 to about 8.6% on bonds due 2010, according to a spokesman for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., the lead underwriter. Previously, yields ranged from 5.4% in 1988 to about 8.6% in 2010. The offering also includes bonds priced to yield 6.5% in 1991, 7% in 1993, 8% in 2000 and 8.5% in 2003.    The New York offering also includes the first insured bonds ever sold by the city. Bonds due 1996, 1997 and 1999 will be insured by Financial Guaranty Insurance Co., while bonds due from 2004 through 2007 will be insured by Bond Investors Guaranty Insurance Co., the Goldman Sachs spokesman said.    City officials expect the insured bonds to get triple-A ratings from both Moody's and Sandamp;P, with the uninsured bonds to be rated Baa-1 by Moody's and triple-B-plus by Sandamp;P.    Separately, the New Hampshire Municipal Bond Bank sold about $52.3 million of revenue bonds. Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., the underwriter, reoffered the issue to investors with bonds yielding from 5.2% in 1988 to 8% in 2012, a Kidder Peabody spokesman said. The issue is rated single-A by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P. </TEXT></DOC>
