The other concerns weren't identified.    Richard S. Kay, senior vice president, finance, said he anticipates an announcement will be made &quot;in the near future.&quot;    &quot;No agreement has been reached and discussions are continuing. There can be no assurance that any transaction will be consummated,&quot; the company said.    Mr. Kay said that the acquisition discussions have been going on for a few weeks. Over a longer period, the company has been discussing the possibility of a capital infusion through a private placement of securities.    Energy Factors said it made the announcement because of unusual trading activity in its stock in the past two days. Yesterday, the company's shares closed in national over-the-counter trading at $15.25, up $1.25, after trading was halted briefly pending the announcement. On Wednesday, the stock rose $1.25 and 155,700 shares changed hands, about three times average daily volume. </TEXT></DOC>
