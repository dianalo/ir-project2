An algorithm is described which uses a simple multi-levelthresholding operation to form a symbolic representation of weather radarreflectivity images. This representation allows the use of detailed rulesfor the detection of quantification of the image features. A method isdescribed for using this information to identify significant intensitypeaks in an image, and examples of its performance are shown.</TEXT></DOC>
