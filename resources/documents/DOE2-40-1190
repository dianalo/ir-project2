Capital costs include the slurrypreparation facilities, the pipeline and associated equipment, and theslurry receiving facilities. Slurry pipeline systems are not too differentin pipeline costs from conventional oil pipeline systems; a preliminaryestimate of the capital costs can be calculated using the methods indicatedin this paper. Operating costs of a typical long distance system aremade up of the following items: energy costs; operational and managementstaff payroll; office and operations overheads; property taxes; insurancecosts; and loss of product. Having established the expected capital andoperating costs of a particular system, the unit transportation costsover the life of a project can be computed, and a general overview ofthe financial variables involved in such a computation is presented.A case study is used to illustrate the calculation methods describedin this paper. 4 refs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
