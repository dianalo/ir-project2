The FBI said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to determinewhether federal law had been violated.   The Times reported that the ``virus'' program was created by aCornell University graduate student whose father is one of thegovernment's most respected computer security experts.   The Times' Saturday editions quoted two sources with detailedknowledge of the case as saying that Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, wrotethe program as an experiment that went haywire and jammed more than6,000 computers nationwide.   The elder Morris is chief scientist at the National ComputerSecurity Center in Bethesda, Md., the arm of the National SecurityAgency devoted to protecting computers against outside attack.   Morris, 56, told the Times that the virus ``has raised the publicawareness to a considerable degree,'' he said. ``It is likely tomake people more careful and more attentive to vulnerabilities inthe future.''   The younger Morris could not be reached for comment Friday, theTimes said.   At government and university computer centers across the nation,the big systems were up and running Friday after their operatorsfinished purging the virus instructions from their machines.   ``Everything seems calm this morning,'' said Bob Logan, systemsmanager at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.``It's just a lot of aggravation right now. ... We want to look andmake sure that besides doing what it (the virus) did it didn't leavesome little time bomb that's going to go off.''   The virus, a sort of rogue program that reproduced in computersand apparently instructed them to send copies of itself to othermachines through a research network, ARPANET, slowed computers andused up memory space. But most operators said the biggest problemwas the time wasted while eliminating it.   About 1,000 hours of staff time was spent cleaning up some 200computers at the University of Colorado, said public relationsdirector Pauline Coker.   ``There was no real damage. The program is not the big deal _ thebig deal is that it happened,'' said Hans Werner Braun, chiefprogrammer for the University of Michigan.   The Times reported Friday that an anonymous caller to thenewspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as aharmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when itgot out of hand.   Once Caltech's computers were disconnected from ARPANET'selectronic mail system and turned back on Thursday night, ``we couldwatch the virus trying to spread from infected machines on thenetwork,'' Logan said.   ARPANET, established by the Defense Department's AdvancedResearch Projects Agency, is used by researchers and defensecontractors to share data at high speed.   The virus also spread into some government computers, from NASA'sLangley Research Center at Hampton, Va., to the Los Alamos NationalLaboratory in New Mexico. Computers used for classified work areseparate from those affected by the virus.   Computers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one ofthe nation's nuclear weapons design centers, were shut down lateWednesday, but turned back on and reconnected to ARPANET Fridaymorning, said spokeswoman Bonnie Jean Barringer. No data was lostbut research was disrupted for the day, she said.   Dr. Raymond S. Colladay, the director of the Advanced ResearchProjects Agency, told a Pentagon briefing the virus had beendefeated in roughly 24 hours' time.   Colladay said the computer experts and researchers who use thesystem had concluded the virus program, while fairly sophisticated,did not contain any ``Trojan horse'' bug that could crop up again ata later time.   He also said he thought computer experts ultimately couldpinpoint the general geographic location from which the bug wasdelivered, but would probably be unable to pinpoint a specificindividual user as the perpetrator.   In Washington, FBI spokesman William Carter announced thepreliminary inquiry and said a criminal investigation ultimatelywould be launched if it is determined federal law was violated.   The bureau will review the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, whichdeals with unauthorized access to government computers or computersin two or more states.   If records within the computer systems that were ``infected'' arefound to have been destroyed or harmed, the FBI could conduct afull-scale investigation, Carter said.   Purdue University computers also were restarted Friday, butslowly. ``We hope there are no Trojan horses hidden,'' said SteveHare, research facilities manager of Purdue's computer sciencedepartment.   Boston University computers were back on Friday but had not beenlinked back up with the network, said Mary Riendeau, coordinator ofuser services for the computer science department.   Many institutions didn't discover the virus until Thursday, butLos Alamos scientists detected it Wednesday evening and isolatedtheir computers from the network.   ``It was noticeable, but not catastrophic,'' said Los Alamoscomputer security officer Jimmy McClary. He said there was no damagebut a few hundred scientists suffered delays in their work.   ``We were warned yesterday morning to board up the windows andprotect ourselves,'' said Leslie Maltz, director of computing andcommunication resources at Stevens Institute of Technology inHoboken, N.J. He would not say who gave the warning.   ``We'll keep systems removed 'til all clear is sounded, severaldays at most I would think,'' Maltz said.   Carnegie Mellon University computers in Pittsburgh wereinoculated five years ago with programs that recognized the virusand tried to send the messages back to their return address. Whenthat proved to be an improper format the system channeled the virusmessages to a file to be examined by humans, said Bob Cosgrove,director of computing services at CMU.   But at the University of Illinois, the virus was still causingtrouble Friday.   ``We went home last night thinking it wouldn't come back becausewe had closed the hole it was coming in through, but it apparentlyhas multiple ways of attacking the system and we got hit again,''said Charley Kline, senior research programmer at the university.   It appeared that most infected machines were either DigitalEquipment Corp. VAX or Sun Microsystems computers, and all used BSDUNIX operating system, the master program that lets a computer runother programs, said Logan at Caltech.   It was ``one of the most complex viruses we've seen,'' said JohnMcAfee, director of the Computer Virus Industry Association in SantaClara, a group of 11 computer companies that market anti-viralprograms.   ``It's been a royal nuisance ... but of the spectrum of thingsthat could have happened it was the least destructive thing thatcould have been done,'' said Bill Johnston, a computer scientist atthe Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, part of the University ofCalifornia-Berkeley.   McAfee said the virus took advantage of a little-known flaw inthe send-mail feature of the UNIX operating system as modified byUC-Berkeley. ``The perpetrator was an extremely sophisticatedindividual,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
