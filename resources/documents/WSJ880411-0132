The good news, as administration officials read it, is that obstacles to the withdrawal of 115,000 Soviet troops are almost all cleared. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Afghan President Najibullah said last week the pullout could begin May 15 if, as expected, Pakistan and Afghan negotiators in Geneva sign an accord soon.    The bad news is that Pakistan, under domestic and outside pressure, has made so many concessions at the negotiating table that the Soviet Union will remain free to arm its puppet Kabul regime, and Afghanistan's future will be as uncertain after the agreement as it is now.    Rushing to get an agreement, Pakistan dropped its demand that the Geneva accord require the Soviets to scale down military aid to the Afghan regime in tandem with reductions in U.S. support to the resistance forces. The Soviets argued such an arrangement would violate their treaties with the Afghans dating back to 1921. In separate talks with the U.S., the Soviets rejected a U.S. plan for both countries to stop supplying arms to the warring parties. Instead, Moscow and Washington agreed they both have the right to do just the opposite -- to continue arming, respectively, the Kabul regime and the anti-Soviet Moslem guerrillas during and after the Soviet troop withdrawal.    Pakistan also retreated from its refusal to sign a Geneva accord until agreement was reached on a new Afghan government that included resistance leaders. They instead accepted United Nations mediator Diego Cordovez's assurance that he would broker negotiations between Afghan parties to form a more representative government. That makes civil war, albeit without the heavily armed Soviet troops, the likely form for deciding Afghanistan's future.    The Afghan resistance's firmest backers worry about these concessions. Republican Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire visited Pakistan and Geneva last week to talk with Pakistani officials and resistance leaders. He concluded that the guerrilla leaders oppose the terms and urged President Reagan &quot;to refuse to commit the United States to the agreements unless and until the {resistance} leaders agree in writing to the terms.&quot;    But a senior administration official says the U.S. has decided that a flawed agreement is better than slowing the withdrawal by setting too many conditions. The Soviet-supported Najibullah regime won't survive longer than six months after the agreements are signed, no matter how many arms Moscow sends, he predicts.    Because the emerging accord will allow Moscow to continue arming the Afghan regime, the U.S. plans to announce that it will continue to back the resistance. The problem is that at Geneva, Pakistan will promise not to interfere in Afghanistan's internal affairs, so it technically can't serve any longer as a conduit for U.S. arms to the resistance. Yet the administration, under congressional pressure, will insist that Pakistan continue backing the resistance, as will three million Afghan refugees on Pakistani soil.    &quot;It isn't a good precedent to go along with an agreement that involves the Soviets that you know your side will have to violate,&quot; says an administration official. Pakistani cheating could prompt Moscow to declare the accords void or to attack Afghan-resistance camps in Pakistan.    Pakistani officials say they softened their negotiating position in response to domestic pressures for a quick agreement, lack of firm U.S. backing, and increasing Soviet threats. Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Yuli Vorontsov told President Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq that &quot;grave consequences&quot; would result from Pakistani intransigence at Geneva.    President Zia knows what that means. Terrorist bombings are common in Pakistan, and officials say bomb materials they have found are of Soviet origin and agents they have captured are Soviet-trained.    Pakistani officials were upset last month when Afghan negotiators revived a century-old border dispute. Afghanistan has never officially accepted the Durand Line that Britain drew as the Afghan-Pakistani border in 1893. The border runs smack through Pushtun tribal territory. At various times, Afghan leaders have called for an independent &quot;Pushtunistan&quot; or annexation of the entire territory by Afghanistan -- an open invitation to subversion.    The Pakistani agenda through six years of Geneva talks has been to solve the border issue once and for all with a provision that refers to non-interference across &quot;internationally recognized frontiers.&quot;    Upset by Pakistani foot-dragging at the Geneva talks, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during a speech in Bulgaria strongly endorsed the Kabul regime's decision to reject this language.    &quot;The Pakistanis are under incredible pressure,&quot; says Rosanne Klass, an expert on Afghanistan at New York's Freedom House. &quot;The Soviets are essentially raising the threat of {fomenting separatist} communal riots and challenging the survival of Pakistan.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
