Many of the proposed &quot;rate reforms&quot; are actuallymechanisms for shifting the burden of increased costs of service ontoone customer class or another. However, out of the many types of &quot;ratereform&quot; offered, the one that seems to make the most sense from bothan economic and a logical point of view is time-of-use pricing. TOU ratesshould not be advocated because current average cost-based rate structuresare &quot;wrong,&quot; but rather because TOU rates may more accurately reflectactual cost of service when the differential between these costs duringpeak and off-peak periods is significant. The objective of TOU ratesis to indicate to the consumer through a rate structure, the utility'scost of providing service at any given time. It should not be the objectiveof time-differentiated rates to force any customers off the system norto penalize them for consuming electricity during any particular period.Rather, the objective is to match the price to the cost so the consumermay make a rational choice of consumption level during any period. Highload factor, industrial customers do not object to the institution ofTOU rates, provided that such rates are applied fairly and are not usedas a mechanism for the achievement of social goals. The industrial customers'main concern is that TOU pricing mechanisms will be utilized to keepresidential customers rates artificially low during this current periodof rising energy prices. If time-of-use rates are such a good idea, theyshould be good for everybody.</TEXT></DOC>
