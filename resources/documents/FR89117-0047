Theorder, which excluded seven firms, established rates of cash deposit ofestimated countervailing duties of 55.89 percent for one firm, Sonocal,and 1.21 percent for all other firms. These rates are still applicable.On July 21, 1988, the Government of Mexico requested a changed circumstancesadministrative review of this order in accordance with section 751(b) ofthe Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act''). The Government of Mexico requestedthe Department to examine the purchase of Sonocal by Bomintzha (``SociedadCooperativa E.E.R.R. Bomintzha, S.C.L.'') and to determine whether thetransaction was at `'arm's length,'' thereby permitting the Departmentto apply to Bomintzha the `'all other'' rate for purposes of cash depositof estimated countervailing duties. On August 2, 1988, the Department published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 29076) a notice of initiation of changedcircumstances administrative review of the countervailing duty order onlime from Mexico. We stated that, in this review, we would determine whetheran actual sale took place and whether bounties or grants received by Sonocalcontinued to provide benefits to Bomintzha. We further stated that thereview would be conducted to determine whether the rate of cash depositof estimated countervailing duties for exports by Bomintzha should be changedto the ``all other'' rate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review </ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customers Cooperation council,has developed a system or tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) as providedfor in section 1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after this date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s). Imports covered by this review are shipments from Mexico by Bomintzha ofcalcium oxide (CaO), commonly called quicklime or lime, and calcium hydroxide[Ca(OH)<T2>2</T2>], commonly called hydrated lime or hydrate. These products arecurrently classifiable under HTS item numbers 2520.20.00, 2522.10.00 and2522.30.00. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of the Transaction </ITAG>On September 2, 1986, Bomintzha signed a contract for the purchase of Sonocal.The co-signers included a commercial bank acting as the government's agentfor the sale, and the various government entities that together owned allof Sonocal's shares. In purchasing 100 percent of Sonocal's shares, Bomintzhaacquired all of Sonocal's assets and liabilities with the exception ofSonocal's bank debt, which was assumed by the Government of Mexico. The sale of Sonocal took place under the auspices of a program, begun bythe Mexican government in 1983, for rationalizing the parastatal sectorand privatizing parastatal companies in nonpriority sectors. (A parastatalcompany is one that is owned in whole or in part by the government.) Aspart of this program, numerous parastatal companies were liquidated, merged,terminated or sold. For each company to be sold, the government appointeda major bank as its agent for conducting the sale. The agent was chargedwith undertaking studies to evaluate the company in preparation for itssale, announcing the sale in the media, preparing a timetable for the receiptof bids, and defining the terms and arrangements for the sale. In conductingthe sale, the agent, who received a commission based on the sales price,was to consider the various goals of privatization, among them ensuringthe economic viability of the company and preserving productive capacityand employment. Agents were expected to seek the best conditions of salefor the government but, at the same time, were authorized to be pragmaticand flexible. The assumption of bank debt, where conditions warranted,was one of the procedures authorized by the governmental committee overseeingthe sale of parastatals. On January 20, 1986, a public notice appeared in newspapers nationwidethat Sonocal, along with other parastatals, was for sale. The notice announcedthat interested parties were to contact the designated agent for more information.Prospective buyers were able to obtain the independent appraisals of Sonocal'sphysical assets, a valuation of its land, geological studies of Sonocal'slimestone deposits, and Sonocal's financial statements from the government'sdesignated agent. Before making its bid, Bomintzha made an on-site inspection of the Sonocalplant and its limestone deposits. As part of its bid, Bomintzha submittedits own financial statements, statements of financial condition and financialforecasts, along with relevant information on its experience and futureplans. The agent accepted Bomintzha's bid and recommended the bid for approvalto the governmental committee overseeing the sale of parastatals. On May15, 1986, in a letter to the agent, the committee stated that it had determined,following a financial analysis of Sonocal as well as the various bids tobuy it, that selling Sonocal to Bomintzha assured the best conditions forthe government and that the government would assume Sonocal's bank debt.In analyzing the sale of Sonocal to Bomintzha, we stated in our initiationof this changed circumstances review that we had two concerns: (1) Whetherownership of Sonocal was actually transferred such that Sonocal, whichwas a 100-percent government-owned company when we made our final determination,ceased to exist; and (2) whether bounties or grants received by Sonocalcontinue to provide benefits to Bomintzha. Based on the terms of the September 2, 1986 purchase contract, we concludethat ownership of Sonocal was transferred to Bomintzha. Bomintzha financedthe purchase with loans from the Mexican government (see below) and nowowns Sonocal in much the same way as any purchaser owns mortgaged property.Therefore, we preliminarily determine that Sonocal is no longer a government-ownedcompany. With respect to the question of whether bounties or grants received bySonocal continue to benefit Bomintzha (<T3>i.e.</T3>, whether such benefits were passed through to Bomintzha),we based our analysis on the proposition that, to the extent that the pricepaid for a government-owned company reflects the company's market value,we believe it is reasonable to presume, as outlined below, that any countervailablebenefits previously granted to the company are fully reflected in the purchaseprice and that such benefits are not passed through to the purchaser. In our final determination, we found the following benefits to Sonocalcountervailable: government equity infusions since 1982, which we determinedwas the year that Sonocal became unequityworthy; delayed fuel paymentsto Pemex (the government-owned oil monopoly), which we considered to beinterest-free loans; and various types of preferential loans. The government equity infusions, which ceased as a result of the sale,increased Sonocal's net worth. The continued obligation for operating liabilities,such as Sonocal's unpaid Pemex bills, had the effect of decreasing thecompany's net worth. Finally, with the government's assumption of Sonocal'sbank debt, the company's net worth increased. As a consequence, any effectfrom the countervailable benefits provided to Sonocal would be reflectedin Sonocal's current net worth, and a prospective buyer would take thecurrent net worth into account when estimating Sonocal's market value andmaking an offer. Ultimately, a company's value is whatever price the market will bear, regardlessof its net worth. Thus, while a logical starting point for analyzing Sonocal'smarket value is the value of its assets minus liabilities (``net worth''),we recognize that Sonocal's net worth, or the appraised value of its physicalassets, or any other objective measure of its value, is not necessarilyan accurate measure of its market value. Innumerable factors can influence a company's market value, some of themost important being a company's net worth and the value of its physicalassets. While some of these factors are measurable, many factors whosevalue is difficult to quantify also affect the market value, such as futureexpectations of inflation, recession, or changes in interest rates. To ensure that market forces are allowed to operate, an important considerationis whether an open, competitive bidding process is in place. We have examinedthe bidding process and the Government of Mexico's stated goals for thesale of Sonocal and other parastatals. The Government of Mexico's agentconducted an open bidding process, in which Bomintzha participated alongwith other bidders. Bomintzha's bid was selected by the agent and subsequentlyapproved by the Mexican government as representing the best conditionsof sale for the government. In addition to the price offered, the agenthad to consider various factors in making this determination, among themthe continued economic viability of the company and the preservation ofemployment. Although the Mexican government had goals other than solely to maximizeits financial return when selling parastatals, it does not necessarilyfollow that, with such goals, the Mexican government's sale of Sonocalprovided a benefit to Bomintzha. All prospective buyers were subject tothe same conditions and were evaluated with the same goals in mind. Anyconditions attached to the sale had to be taken into consideration by prospectivebuyers and, to the extent that these conditions (such as the obligationto make necessary investments and maintain employment) were perceived asacting to the detriment rather than the benefit of the buyer, they mayhave resulted in lower bids. However, the lower level of bidding wouldnot provide a benefit to the eventual buyer if it merely reflected theperception of additional risk and cost attached to the purchase. In thiscontext, accepting the bid that represented the best terms for the governmentcould still indicate that the tendered price reflected the company's marketvalue. At the time of the sale, Sonocal was in considerable financial difficulty.Its accumulated losses were well in excess of its paid-in capital. It hadbank debt nearly equal to the appraised value of its physical assets andin excess of the price offered by Bomintzha. With the Mexican government'sassumption of Sonocal's bank debt, Sonocal's net worth was somewhat higherthan Bomintzha's bid and somewhat lower than the appraised value of thephysical assets. In determining an appropriate sales price for Sonocal, a prospective buyerand the Mexican government would have had to consider many factors, including:the current market demand for the company's products; the condition ofits physcial assets and the need for any major repairs; the degree of technicalsophistication of the machinery; and the recent and expected financialperformance of the company. Depending on the results of such an analysis,the parties involved in the sale could have determined that Sonocal waseither overvalued or undervalued in relation to the value that appearedin its financial records. After assessing Sonocal's value based on suchfactors, a prospective buyer would have offered what he estimated wouldbe a successful bid and the Mexican government would have had to determinewhat was an acceptable bid. Sonocal had been cut off from a substantial portion of its traditionalmarket in the United States by the high countervailing duty rate. In purchasingSonocal, Bomintzha expected that the countervailing duty would no longerbe applicable and had reason to believe that its long-term market prospectswere very good. Bomintzha, as well as other bidders, had an opportunityto inspect Sonocal's physical plant, and while Bomintzha's subsequent problemswith repairs and plant operation suggest that the condition of the equipmentwas far from optimal, we have no evidence that Bomintzha or the Mexicangovernment was aware of this at the time of the sale. Therefore, we haveno reason to assume that the value of the physical assets was anythingless than the value recorded in the June 30, 1986 balance sheet, a documentthat was considered in the purchase contract to be an accurate representationof Sonocal's current financial condition. However, Sonocal's financial performance in the several years prior tothe sale was daunting. It had not made a profit in more than five years.In 1984 and 1985, the two completed fiscal years prior to the sale, Sonocal'scombined losses exceeded the total value of its paid-in capital. At thetime of the sale, its accumulated losses accounted for half of its totalliabilities. Even in the first six months of 1986, its losses were wellin excess of the difference between the price Bomintzha paid and Sonocal'snet worth. On this basis alone, the purpose of Sonocal clearly involveda risk. Any potential buyer, however confident in his ability to turn thecompany around, would have expected continued losses in the near term.At the same time, the Mexican government would have had to take Sonocal'sfinanical condition into consideration in determining what it could expectto receive for Sonocal.  Given such dire financial circumstances, a seller would weigh heavily thealternative of continued substantial losses and declining net worth indetermining the reasonableness of any offer. A buyer, faced with the inherentrisk in purchasing such a company, would have to factor in the costs ofmaking the company viable (or the cost of possible failure) against anyobjective measure of the company's value, such as the appraised value ofits physical assets or its net worth. In this context, the price that theMexican government accepted appears reasonable because that price, althoughlower than these measures of Sonocal's value, reflects the risks involvedin purchasing Sonocal. On this basis, we preliminarily determine that theprice Bomintzha paid reflected Sonocal's market value and, therefore, thatno benefits to Sonocal passed through to Bomintzha.  The petitioners have alleged that the terms of the mortgage obtained byBomintzha from the Mexican government are preferential. Based on this premise,they conclude that the Department must determine that bounties or grantsprovided to Sonocal passed through to Bomintzha. We do not agree. If thefinancing were preferential, we would consider it a benefit provided directlyto Bomintzha and, therefore, outside the scope of this review. The purposeof this review is very limited_to determine whether, pending completionof a section 751(a) review, Bomintzha should be subject to the rate ofcash deposit of estimated countervailing duties applicable to Sonocal orthe rate applicable to all other, including new, exporters. We will examinethe mortgage terms and any other potential benefits provided to Bomintzhain the recently initiated section 751(a) administrative review for calendaryear 1987 and any subsequent reviews, if requested.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of Review  </ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that bounties orgrants provided by the Government of Mexico to Sonocal before its saleto Bomintzha in 1986 do not continue to provide benefits to Bomintzha.Therefore, the Department preliminarily determines that the appropriaterate of cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties for Bomintzha'sexports of time to the United States is the ``all other'' rate of 1.21percent <T3>ad valorem</T3>.  The Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to collect a cashdeposit of estimated countervailing duties of 1.21 percent of the f.o.b.invoice price on shipments from Bomintzha of this merchandise entered,or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publicationof the final results of this administrative review. This deposit requirementshall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the nextadministrative review.  Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within seven days of the date of publication.Any hearing, if requested, will be held 30 days from the date of publicationor the next workday following.  Any request for an administrative protective order must be made no laterthan five days after the date of publication. The Department will publishthe final results of this administrative review including the results ofits analysis of issues raised in any such written comments or at a hearing. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(b)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(b)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.41(b). <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 9, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
