I moved to the outside and I hit my horse left-handed and he juststarted cruising.&quot;;   French Seventyfive won by a length over Forty NinerDays, who finished a neck in front of the Irish-born Batshoff.;   The winnerpaid $23, $10.20 and $5.20.;   It was a perfect game plan as far as Boulangerand French Seventyfive's trainer, Jack Van Berg, were concerned.;   Boulangersaid the strategy was to lay back five lengths or so early, then make a moveon the far turn. It worked just that way. French Seventyfive took the lead forgood at the eighth pole.;   And a little scouting didn't hurt.;   &quot;I had twoof my people walk the course in the morning and they said the turf was firmuntil you got to the quarter pole and then it got soft and you'd better getoutside,&quot; Van Berg said. &quot;That's what we did. You couldn't have drawn a mapand have it followed any better.&quot;;   French Seventyfive has won six of his 16races, with four seconds and two thirds. The colt, son of Boitron out of HighPleasant, is owned by Gayno Stables.;   The bettors were wary of Forty NinerDays, the Northern California horse of the year, because of a heavy travelingschedule this summer and fall. Batshoff was the favorite at post time at 5-2,with Forty Niner Days at 7-2 and Free At Last and Rudy's Fantasy at 4-1.;  Free At Last, which won two stakes races at Golden Gate Fields last spring,finished fifth and Rudy's Fantasy ran seventh.;   Corey Nakatani, Forty NinerDays' jockey, refused to say his horse was tired.;   &quot;I don't think he was --he ran a big race,&quot; Nakatani said.;   Jockey Ron Hansen said Free At Last &quot;rangood. She did everything she could . . . but she just wasn't good enough tobeat them.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAN HRUBY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911215  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  436  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 15, 199100350235,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
