A monthly report from the Centers for Disease Control listed 14adults and two children who were diagnosed with AIDS more thaneight years ago and still are not listed among the dead.   If those statistics are an accurate portrayal of AIDS inAmerica, as many as 20 percent of the known patients from thedisease's earliest known days _ when the number of patients was afraction of what it is today _ are still alive, giving rise to ahope that AIDS is survivable in a number of cases.   But CDC scientists and other AIDS experts acknowledge that mostof those early ``survivors,'' along with many others from morerecent years, probably have died, their deaths unreported to thefederal government. But at least some people are living for fiveyears or more and have been confirmed to have the disease.   ``People who are not listed as dead are not necessarily alive,''said Dr. Ann Hardy, who spearheaded a CDC study ``looking at thesepeople. Are they really alive? Did they really have AIDS?''   Ms. Hardy, who has since transferred to the National Center forHealth Statistics, said her study managed to track down at leastsome information on 780 people who, by statistical count, seemed tohave survived AIDS since being diagnosed in 1983 or before.   In fact, the CDC study confirmed that 475, or 61 percent, ofthose 780 presumed survivors had indeed died, but local healthofficials had not reported their deaths to the federal government.   An additional 186, or 24 percent, ``are lost to follow-up,'' shesaid. ``What we would probably guess is that a good proportion aredead, but they went out of the country, or to another state, andthe local health departments lost track of them.''   The remaining 119 pre-1984 AIDS patients were still alive at thetime of the study, which was conducted in 1987-88. Researcherstried to have those patients tested to confirm that they actuallyhad AIDS; since AIDS tests did not come into use until themid-1980s, many early AIDS diagnoses, based on symptoms alone, maybe wrong, they reasoned.   Out of 47 people diagnosed with AIDS before 1984 who agreed toblood tests, six showed no sign of AIDS infection. The remaining 41were confirmed as living patients of acquired immune deficiencysyndrome.   ``While ... the mortality is high, there are some who aresurviving. Mortality is not 100 percent,'' Ms. Hardy said. ``Thereare some people doing fairly well. ... There are a lot ofpossibilities as to why, but it's impossible to sort out.''   The CDC study found nine people diagnosed with AIDS in 1981 orearlier who were still alive _ but none would agree to blood teststo confirm that they actually had AIDS, Ms. Hardy said.   In San Francisco, which has the nation's third-highest number ofAIDS cases behind New York and Los Angeles, the Department ofPublic Health tracks individual AIDS patients. Researchers theresaid that as of the end of 1988, 24 AIDS patients were believed tobe alive five years or longer after diagnosis, including one whohad survived eight years.   ``That's a very small number,'' said Dr. George Lemp, chief ofthe AIDS Surveillance Branch at the San Francisco Department ofPublic Health. ``Our estimate of survival is 3 percent past fiveyears.''   Scientists have reported in recent years that the survival timefor some AIDS patients is lengthening. Diagnoses have improved anddoctors now can use drugs to treat some of the deadly diseases letin by the weakened immune systems of AIDS patients, such as a rareform of pneumonia and even tuberculosis.   Still, Lemp said, the prognosis for AIDS patients remains poor.   ``There are a small proportion of persons who appear to livebeyond five years, but we don't know if there are any specificreasons for that, other than there may be some individual factorinvolved,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
