It is possible to improve this processby developing software tools to increase accuracy and speed of interpretation.First, by presenting logs on a computer graphic display, work with originallog data and results of the processing algorithms can be done interactively.Presentation can be modified to emphasize or suppress various features.Also, another goal is to provide the operator with direct aids for interpretation.Signal processing, pattern recognition and expert system techniques arebeing used to develop a system of programs which approximate log interpretation.Research described in this paper focuses on automating the two main tasks,geologic contact recognition and lithologic interpretation. For contactrecognition, the approach has been to calculate the change in the digitallog values within a variable sized, moving depth gate; a function relatinggate size and log response change is used to control when a contact ispicked. The algorithm for automated interpretation incorporates bothlog statistics and heuristic rules during processing. These are organizedinto a frame structured knowledge base; interpretation is performed byclassifying the log interval and then comparing the data and lithologicrules, using various algorithms. Tests using the contact-recognitionand lithologic-interpretation methods show successful results when comparedto more conventional methods. 19 refs., 12 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
