White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, speaking withreporters on Air Force One en route from Washington, said noagreements were expected to emerge from Bush's first foreign trip aspresiden.   On the eve of his visit here for five hours of meetings withMulroney, Bush declared regarding acid rain that ``the time forstudy alone has passed, and the time for action is now.''   In a speech to a joint session of Congress on Thursday night, heurged creation of an acid rain program that would curb sulfurdioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. He said he wanted timetablesset, but didn't announce what deadlines he had in mind.   Still, that was a step away from the policy of the Reaganadministration, which insisted for eight years that more researchwas needed on acid rain and clean-coal technology beforeemission-reduction timetables could be considered.   Mulroney greeted Bush at an air base outside the city, withCanadian and American flags snapping in the wind behind them. Thetwo leaders then rode in a motorcade through snow-coveredcountryside to the complex of government buildings.   The first in a series of meetings took place in the officialCanadian government guest house. Bush and Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III and other top government aides sat across a long tablefrom Mulroney and his top assistants.   ``We're here to do a little business,'' Mulroney said, joking atone point that the 16-degree temperature outside was quite differentfrom the usual climate of Bush's adopted home state of Texas.   Bush said in his speech to Congress that his administration wouldhonor a U.S. commitment to Canada to spend $2.5 billion over fiveyears to develop technology for burning coal more cleanly. Heproposed spending $120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acid rain,roughly $25 million more than that proposed by the Reaganadministration.   Mulroney, in the early months of his second term as theProgressive Conservative Party head of government, has called Bush a``great friend of Canada.''   Mulroney has said he expects a good relationship with Washingtonto produce an agreement on acid rain _ an issue that has causedlingering strains between Ottawa and Washington.   In a letter at the front of a press book assessing U.S.-Canadianrelations, Bush said he thought it was ``entirely fitting'' that hechose Canada for his first visit outside the United States. Hecalled it ``our friend and neighbor to the north.''   In advance of Bush's trip to Ottawa, Canadian officials hadvoiced hope of making headway on winning an American commitment toprecise timetables for reducing industrial emissions wafting intoCanada from the United States.   In his proposed changes to the fiscal 1990 budget that formerPresident Reagan submitted, Bush indicated he will seek specificdates for reductions of certain emissions, although the timetablewas not spelled out.   Mulroney had a half-day of meetings, including a luncheon,awaiting Bush and the presidential entourage, which includedSecretary of State James A. Baker III, national security adviserBrent Scowcroft and White House chief of staff John Sununu.   Aside from discussions of acid rain, the two leaders wereexpected to review how each country will implement the U.S.-CanadaFree Trade Agreement, now approved on both sides of the border. Thepact is aimed at phasing out all trade barriers between the twonations.   During a visit to Washington in April 1988, Mulroney pleadedbefore a joint meeting of Congress for what he conceded would beexpensive programs to clean up U.S. plant emissions. Such pollution,he said, was responsible for half the acid rain that has killed15,000 Canadian lakes and threatened or damaged 300,000 more.   During a briefing for White House reporters earlier this week,Scowcroft said he did not expect major new Bush administrationacid-rain commitments in the Ottawa talks. Bush merely reaffirmed acommitment that Reagan had made, but he proposed spending more moneyto attack the problem.   Scowcroft said Bush believes ``the first step has to be thedomestic part of the acid rain agenda _ before he's prepared to beall that specific with the Canadians.''   Edward Fried, a scholar at the liberal-oriented BrookingsInstitution here, said he did not think substantive issues needed tobe discussed.   The Bush trip, Fried said, is ``a useful, inexpensive gesture tothe Canadian people and to the Canadian government. I think it'simportant for both of them to say ... there are going to beproblems, but we're both going to win on this.''</TEXT></DOC>
