And a remarkable thing. After all, there was no Soviet Union until 1923, the year after the last foreign troops left Russia and four years after the American soldiers were evacuated. Even the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic was established only in July 1918, four months after the British landed in Murmansk, which was in turn eight months before the Allied armistice with Germany.    Russia, the Allies and the U.S. were deep into a world war when the democratic provisional government of Russia was toppled by a Bolshevik coup d'etat in Petrograd in October/November 1917.    The Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs), who were the majority party in Russia in 1917, almost immediately went into military opposition, along with sundry minority parties and various monarchists, against the minority Bolsheviks.    The Allies, fearful that their German enemies -- who promptly after the Bolshevik coup had occupied the Baltic states and landed troops in Finland -- would move on and occupy Russia, decided to secure their Russian supply depots in Murmansk, Archangelsk, and Vladivostok lest the war materiel fall into German hands and be used against them on the Western front.    At worst, Allied intervention was interference in Russia's civil war, hardly an attack on a legitimate government; and, at best, it was merely protecting Allied military interest during a long and bloody world war. Neither would be morally or legally reprehensible, much less properly termed an &quot;invasion.&quot;    All soviets (ad hoc councils) of Russia, as hard as it is for non-specialists to understand, were not Bolshevik-controlled, but rather most of them were sympathetic to the SRs, as was the one which controlled Archangelsk when the Americans landed there.
