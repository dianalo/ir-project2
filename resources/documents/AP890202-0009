That task will fall to Indiraja, a 4,884-pound elephant fromIndia named in honor of the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.   But Indiraja, who will be shipped to Sri Lanka next week to beginyears of training in the sacred service of Buddha, has a tough actto follow.   The new elephant will replace Raja, a popular pachyderm whoserved for half a century at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy,according to Neranjan Wijeratne, the temple's chief custodian. Rajawas long in the tooth himself, reaching the age of 82 before dyingin July.   The 13-year-old Indiraja, also a male, was selected for hisproper posture so that he may carry the sacred tooth of Buddha inone of Asia's most colorful pageants.   ``It will take couple of years to train the elephant,'' Wijeratnesaid Wednesday. He picked out Indiraja during a visit to India afterPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced plans to donate an elephant tothe temple in Kandy, 50 miles east of Colombo.   The death of the beloved Raja, whose name means ``King'' in theSinhalese language, plunged Sinhalese Buddhists into grief. Raja wasso popular that former President Junius R. Jayewardene declared hima national treasure.   Indiraja, who will arrive in Sri Lanka on Feb. 8, measures 7{feet from head to toe and has a flat back. Both his tail and trunktouch the ground in the arc deemed proper for elephants.   The main task for Indiraja will be carrying the sacred tooth,revered as coming from Buddha's own mouth, at the annual Kandypageant, which is held for two weeks in July and August.   Because Indiraja still will be in training at the time of thisyear's festivities, the Temple Committe is trying to find a localmale elephant _ only males can carry the tooth _ for the task.   Efforts are on either to reduce the amount of fireworks and noiseso that the untrained elephant won't panic, or have an elephant whois unaffected by noise and fireworks in the tooth-carrying ceremony.   According to historians, the tooth was smuggled into Sri Lankafrom India in the 4th century for safekeeping during a war.   The tooth is kept in a golden casket at the temple at Kandy.During the festival, it is paraded around the town on an elephant'sback.   Buddhism was founded in India about 500 B.C. when SiddharthaGautama, born a prince, achieved enlightenment. He later came to beknown as Lord Buddha.   Sinhalese Buddhists make up about 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16million people. There are about 5 million Buddhists in India.</TEXT></DOC>
