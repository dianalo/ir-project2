In the STICS-water from thedrill core of the Biwako Group, every one of the measured conductivityvalues was equal to or less than 0.4 mS/cm. These values can be assumedas to indicate that the paleo environment was a fresh water lake. Inthe STICS-water from the drill core of the Osaka Group, the measuredconductivity values were in the range of 0.2 - 3.0 mS/cm, and could begrouped in 3 categories of less than 0.4 mS/cm, 0.4 - 1.2 mS/cm, andabove 1.3 mS/cm which could be assumed to reflect the fresh water, brackishwater, and marine areas respectively. At the eastern end of the SenriyamaHills, type locality of the Osaka Group, it is clarified that the Ma4and Ma6 marine clay beds have two peaks of high conductivity values,and that the Ma5 bed has one clear peak in the lower half. The resultsshow that the electric conductivity of the STICS-water is more effectivein analyzing the sedimentary environments than the methods used previously.(11 figs, 5 tabs, 12 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
