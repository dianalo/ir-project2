Government spokesmen said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir andother leaders would meet Friday to discuss the changes, whichIsrael radio said included assurances that known PLO members wouldnot be allowed to participate.   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the only Arab nation to sign apeace treaty with Israel, conferred in Cairo with Yasser Arafat,chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.   When the PLO has developed a position on the U.S. plan, he said,Egypt ``will sponsor it in our talks with the United States andIsrael.''   Arafat did not comment on the U.S. plan but praised Mubarak foroffering to host Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo, a proposalthat Israel has rejected.   ``We thank and support the initiative that President Mubarakproposed about holding a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue in Egypt inpreparation of an international Middle East peace conference later,God willing,'' Arafat said.   In the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot an 18-year-oldPalestinian to death. Fellow Arabs in a prison camp killed a36-year-old Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeliauthorities, the army said.   In the Gaza Strip, a military jeep struck Wadieh Ali Salem Deeb,28, as he was riding his bicycle, Arab reports said. The armyconfirmed Deeb later died in Shifa Hospital, but said none of itsvehicles were involved in the accident.   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed at least 608Palestinian since an uprising began 23 months ago in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip, and 40 Israelis have died. Fellow Arabshave killed 139 Palestinians, most of them on suspicion ofcollaboration.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III agreed Wednesday to somechanges in the U.S. plan for preliminary peace talks between Israeland Palestinians.   Israel radio said the new version included assurances againstPLO participation and acceptance of Israel's right to boycott themeeting if it did not accept the members of the Palestiniandelegation.   In Washington, a State Department official confirmed privatelythat Baker telephoned Foreign Minister Moshe Arens on Wednesday todiscuss the plan, which Israel had rejected.   ``He looked at the wording and may have made some changes, buthe didn't change the basic thrust,'' the official said. ``If thatmakes (it) more welcome, then good.''   Baker's objective is to convene a preliminary meeting betweenIsrael and Palestinians to revive an Israeli proposal that callsfor elections in the occupied territories to choose representativesto negotiate limited autonomy with Israel. He suggested the meetingtake place in Cairo.   Avi Pazner, an adviser to Shamir, said the prime minister wouldmeet on Friday with Arens, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin andFinance Minister Shimon Peres.   An Israeli government official said, on condition of anonymity:``The fact that Israel's view was taken into consideration is proofthere is movement and it is positive.''   The changes appeared to fall short of Israel's requests. In aletter to Baker last week, Arens said Israel wanted the right toveto individual members of the Palestinian delegation and limit thetalks to the Israeli election proposal.   ``It seems to me the situation is better when it comes towording then it was,'' said Ehud Olmert, a government minister fromShamir's Likud bloc. ``That doesn't mean we should jump toconclusions that everything is fine, but it certainly makes iteasier.''   The 18-year-old killed Thursday in the West Bank was identifiedby the army as Nasser Swati Halima of Beit Awwa. The army said hewas masked and burning tires at the town's entrance soldiersordered him to stop.   ``The youngster tried to throw a backpack toward the officers,who shot toward his legs,'' the army statement said.   It said the other killing occurred in the Ketziot militaryprison in the Negev desert. The army identified the victim as JabrAhmad Nimer Sider of Gaza City and said his attacker was an18-year-old Palestinian from Gaza.   Palestinians in the occupied lands closed their shops Thursdayand and transportation was halted by a strike called by the Islamicfundamentalist movement named Hamas, or Zeal.   It marked the anniversary of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, inwhich Britain called for a Jewish national homeland in Palestine.</TEXT></DOC>
