L. 94-295) establish a comprehensive system for theregulation of medical devices intended for human use. One provision ofthe amendments, section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 360c), establishes three categories (classes) of devices,depending on the regulatory controls needed to provide reasonable assuranceand safety and effectiveness: class I, general controls; class II, performancestandards; and class III, premarket approval.Section 513(d)(2)(A) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c(d)(2)(A)) authorizes FDAto exempt, by regulation, a generic type of class I device from the requirementof, among other things, premarket notification in section 510(k) of theact (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and 21 CFR Part 807, Subpart E. Such an exemptionpermits manufacturers to introduce into commercial distribution generictypes of devices without first submitting to FDA a premarket notification.When FDA was publishing its proposed classification regulations for preamendmentdevices, the agency did not routinely evaluate whether it should grantto manufacturers of devices placed in class I an exemption from the requirementof premarket notification. Generally, FDA considered such exemptions onlywhen the advisory panels specifically included them in recommendationsmade to the agency. Recently, FDA developed criteria for exempting certainclass I devices from the requirement of premarket notification, to reducethe number of unnecessary premarket notifications, thereby freeing agencyresources for the review of more complex notifications. FDA believes that exempting certain devices from premarket notificationwill allow the agency to make better use of its resources and thus betterserve the public. In other words, the process of exempting devices fromthe premarket notification program of section 510(k) of the act (21 U.S.C.360(k)), where premarket notification will not advance FDA's public healthmission, will free additional resources to address pressing regulatoryconcerns and will make the agency more efficient. The development of exemptioncriteria and the issuance of proposed and final rules exempting appropriatedevices from the requirement of premarket notification will help implementa goal in FDA's May 1987 ``A Plan for Action Phase II'' (Ref. 1). On September 2, 1987 (52 FR 33346), FDA published a final regulation classifying109 ophthalmic devices. Also on September 2, 1987 (52 FR 33366), FDA proposedto exempt from the requirement of premarket notification, with limitations,55 of those class I ophthalmic devices. Interested persons were given untilNovember 2, 1987, to comment. No comments were received. Therefore, FDAis adopting the regulation as proposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Criteria for 510(k) Exemptions </ITAG>FDA is exempting a generic type of class I device from the requirementof premarket notification, with the limitations described below, if theagency determines that premarket notification is unnecessary for the protectionof the public health. FDA is granting an exemption if both of the followingcriteria are met: 1. FDA has determined that the device does not have a significant historyof false or misleading claims or of risks associated with inherent characteristicsof the device, such as device design or materials. When making these determinations,FDA may consider the frequency, persistence, cause, or seriousness of suchclaims or risks, or other factors. 2. FDA has determined that: (a) Characteristics of the device necessaryfor its safe and effective performance are well established; (b) anticipatedchanges in the device that are of the type that could affect safety andeffectiveness will (i) be readily detectable by users by visual examinationor other means, such as routine testing, e.g., testing of a clinical laboratoryreagent with positive and negative controls, before causing harm; or (ii)not materially increase the risk of injury, incorrect diagnosis, or ineffectivetreatment; and (c) that any changes in the device will not be likely toresult in a change in the device's classification. FDA will make the determination above based on its knowledge of the device,including past experience and relevant reports or studies on device performance.FDA may, if it has concerns only about certain types of changes in a classI device, grant a limited exemption from premarket notification for thegeneric type of device. A limited exemption will specify what types ofchanges manufacturers must continue to report to FDA in the context ofpremarket notification. For example, FDA may exempt a device except whena manufacturer intends to use a different material. FDA's decision to grant an exemption from the requirement of premarketnotification for a generic type of class I device is based upon the existingand reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributeddevices within that generic type. Because FDA cannot anticipate every changein intended use or characteristic of a device that could significantlyaffect a device's safety or effectiveness, manufacturers of any commerciallydistributed class I device for which FDA has granted an exemption fromthe requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarketnotification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction intointerstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when: (1) The device is intended for a use different from its intended use beforeMay 28, 1976, or the device is intended for a use different from the intendeduse of a preamendments device to which it had been determined to be substantiallyequivalent; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose,or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use wasby health care professionals only; or (2) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientifictechnology than that in use in the device before May 28, 1976; e.g., asurgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpenedmetal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectiousagents by using a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridizationtechnology rather than culture or immunoassay technology. <ITAG tagnum="84">Reference </ITAG>The following information has been placed on display in the Dockets ManagementBranch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 FishersLane, Rockville, MD 20857, and may be seen by interested persons from 9a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. ``Food and Drug Administration_A Plan for Action Phase II,'' PublicHealth Service, Department of Health and Human Services, May 1987, p. 19.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact </ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(2) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment.
