The storm, the latest product of a relentless arctic cold front,blew snow and ice across Southern California on Wednesday aftersmashing low-temperature records throughout northern and centralCalifornia and around the nation.   Rising temperatures and rain in Southern California turnedWednesday's winter wonderland into today's morning mush.   Temperatures rose moderately in most parts of the nation, but theAlaskan front refused to die. Strong wind and cold weather pouredinto the Great Lakes, leaving snow drifts 10 feet high in northernMichigan. Snow also fell early today in Utah, Nevada and New York.   The Alaskan weather has been blamed for at least 92 deathsnationwide since moving into the lower 48 states on Jan. 31.   Cold weather was blamed for the deaths of 26 people in northernMexico, where temperatures have dipped into the teens. Citrusgrowers conducted an emergency harvest of oranges, grapefruit andtangerines but said it was too early to tell how much of Mexico'scitrus crop had been damaged.   Residents of the once-snowy Los Angeles communities of GranadaHills and Tarzana and the nearby city of Thousand Oaks woke up torain.   The Antelope Valley, 60 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,was the only southland area reporting a second day of snowfalltoday. It got 3 to 4 inches.   The cold sent natural gas use to record levels and killed citrusand floral crops, threatening to raise the cost of an orange or aValentine's Day bouquet.   Near-freezing temperatures early today forced street people intoshelters, and the cold apparently claimed a transient's life inFontana, 50 miles east of Los Angeles.   An accident on an icy road killed one person in Redlands, about65 miles east of Los Angeles.   Blowing snow shut Interstate 5, California's main north-southhighway, about 40 miles north of Los Angeles. Hundreds of truckerswere stranded there and at other road closures, the Highway Patrolsaid. Northbound lanes remained closed this morning.   The Antelope Valley Freeway, which runs northeast from the SanFernando Valley to Palmdale, was also closed for much of the day.Today cars were escorted through the snow.   Snowfall Wednesday measured up to half a foot in suburban GranadaHills, Simi Valley, West Hills, Thousand Oaks and Tarzana, closingschools and freeing students to frolic with makeshift sleds andsnowmen. Many schools reopened today.   In Granada Hills, about 25 miles northwest of downtown, childrenused trash can lids and cardboard boxes as sleds.   ``It was all black and ugly and horrible,'' said young Mary EllenCrosby. ``Now it is all white and glistening and beautiful.''   Winter-weary tourists who had flocked to Palm Springs for fun inthe sun were thoroughly disheartened as temperatures hovered at 45degrees and errant snowflakes melted into hot tubs and swimmingpools.   ``I was hoping to play a little tennis, but the weather'sdisappointing,'' said Spencer Videon, a 50-year-old businessman fromAspen, Colo.   In Las Vegas, smart money was betting more snow would fall today,after the gambler's mecca was dusted with a light snowfallWednesday. The city got a dusting of snow overnight.   The Department of Energy postponed an underground nuclear testscheduled Wednesday at the Nevada Test Site. Monitoring aircraftwouldn't have been able to track any accidental release of radiationwhile it was snowing, said DOE spokesman Jim Boyer.   In central California, snow was reported in Bakersfield andelsewhere in the San Joaquin Valley.   Asparagus growers in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleysreported frost damage. Small farmers who grow leaf lettuce also werehurt, but Southern California growers generally were spared, saidClark Biggs, a California Farm Bureau Federation spokesman.   ``They didn't get real cold temperatures in citrus areasovernight,'' Biggs said. ``We've had damage but you couldn't call itdisastrous.''   Still, many growers and packers said lemon groves were hard hitby the cold wave, with some early estimates saying up to 35 percentof the crop may have been damaged.   California is the nation's top producer of lemons, a crop valuedat $152 million in 1987. It will take about a week to 10 days for anaccurate assessment of the frost's damage.   Wholesale prices of oranges already have risen slightly inreaction to the cold. And flower growers in northern California saidtheir crop was badly hurt.   ``The damage is done. The freeze has damaged the crops out thereand I don't expect them to recover at all,'' said George Ginilo,agriculture commissioner in San Mateo County. The county's 1987floral crop was valued at $165 million and serves wholesalers on theWest Coast and in New England.   While some major suppliers of California flowers predicted ashortage, it was unclear whether it would affect the market byValentine's Day. The Farm Bureau Federation said prices may be``slightly higher.''</TEXT></DOC>
