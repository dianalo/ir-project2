The agreement is aimed at tapping the growing demand for electronic, after-hours trading of futures, and possibly stocks, as both markets expand internationally. A limited version of the automated trading system may be available by year end, the companies' officials said.    Intex was founded in Bermuda in 1981 as the first automated futures exchange, but has floundered due to meager trading volume. Telerate is a provider of computerized financial information on global markets. Telerate is 56%-owned by Dow Jones andamp; Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine and other periodicals, electronic business information services and community newspapers.    The marketing venture will compete to an extent with a before-and-after-hours electronic trading system that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC have agreed to form. The Merc-Reuters venture is expected to begin trading in a year to 18 months.    International Commodities Clearing House Ltd., which processes futures trades for several exchanges in London, offers a similar service. </TEXT></DOC>
