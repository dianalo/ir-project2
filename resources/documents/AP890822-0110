LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Najib said Tuesday the Afghanpeople are tired of the 11-year-old civil war and his Marxistgovernment ``is prepared to accept any suggestion'' that will end it.   In outlining a new peace plan, he called for an internationalpeace conference attended by Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, India andChina, with the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors of anagreement.   His plan includes elections six months after a cease-fire, doesnot meet demands by Moslem guerrillas that the 42-year-old formerintelligence chief step down.   ``Our people are fed up with the continuation of this war ofattrition ... in which innocent people are dying. The government ofAfghanistan is prepared to accept any suggestion toward a peacefulsettlement,'' Najib told reporters at the Gulkhana presidentialpalace.   Western experts had predicted the U.S.-supported guerrillas wouldoust Najib's government soon after Soviet military forces withdrewon Feb. 15. Six months later, they have failed twice to captureJalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul, and are squabbling amongthemselves.   Kabul government officials said the Najib plan makes a newconcession to the guerrillas: Talks on forming a broad-basedConsultative Council would be held before a cease-fire rather thanafter, to quiet suspicion that the government would not negotiate ingood faith.   A six-month truce leading to elections would begin when thecouncil was established. The council would organize a broad-basedcoalition government to draft a new constitution and electoral law,which would be approved by a traditional Loyah Jirga, or grandassembly of prominent Afghans.   Guerrilla leaders have rejected previous government peace plansbecause all include Najib and his ruling Communist Party in acoalition.   Najib said he was ready to give up the presidency and even hislife to achieve peace, but added that ignoring the reality of theparty, armed forces and current situation in Afghanistan would only``intensify the war.''   ``Billions of dollars have been spent here,'' he said. ``Allkinds of deadly weapons have been accumulated here. Are all theseefforts to get Najib to step aside? Does that mean all theatrocities committed in the country are just to get rid of Najib?   ``In our opinion, instead of talking about the removal of theparty or the person, let's talk about the participation of peopleand parties in trying to achieve peace,``   Najib claimed the United States was supplying rockets withcluster bombs to the guerrillas, and was guilty of the ``massmassacre'' of civilians as a result.   He also said judgments about the Afghan government by othernations, including those in the West, were ``being radicallychanged.''   ``We are confident that ... even the U.S. administration isrealizing the futility of the continuation of war and will considerthe realities of Afghan society as a basis for making newpolicies,'' he declared.   If the guerrillas ``honestly want a settlement of the problem,and they say they control 85 percent of the country,'' he said,``why are they afraid of elections? Why are they using rockets ofmass killing?''   Najib said the United States and Pakistan believed theU.N.-mediated agreement ended with the Soviet withdrawal, ``but themain issue was to stop intervention in Afghanistan and provide forthe return of Afghan refugees.''   ``If all sides remain faithful to the provisions of the Genevaagreement, it is my opinion that peace soon will prevail in ourcountry,'' he said.   At an international conference, Najib said, ``we are ready, thatif prestigious and credible international guarantees are given, wecan tackle questions of the permanent neutrality of Afghanistan andthe demilitarization of the country.''   The Geneva agreement was signed by Afghanistan and Pakistan,where about 3.5 million Afghan refugees live and many guerrillas arebased, with the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April1978. Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and anestimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began onMay 15, 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
