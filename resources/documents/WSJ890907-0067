Speaking on the condition that they not be identified, the people said Mr. Nesi met briefly with Treasury Minister Guido Carli yesterday to inform him of his plans. Mr. Carli then met with Bank of Italy Governor Carlo A. Ciampi.    BNL's branch in Atlanta is under investigation by U.S. and Italian authorities for alleged irregularities over financing of exports to Iraq. The Georgia Department of Banking and Finance said the Atlanta branch had assets of $785.6 million as of June 30, substantially less than the estimated $1 billion to $2 billion in unauthorized transactions that were kept off the books.    Bruce Kirwan, an attorney for BNL in Atlanta, said the local office would have no comment on the matter.    Political leaders and opinion makers in Italy have asked Mr. Nesi to assume public responsibility for the investigation and step down as head of the big bank.    Mr. Carli is expected to accept Mr. Nesi's resignation and appoint a temporary commissioner to clear up the matter. Italian press reports say Treasury Director General Mario Sarcinelli and Bank of Italy Deputy Governor Lamberto Dini are possible candidates. </TEXT></DOC>
