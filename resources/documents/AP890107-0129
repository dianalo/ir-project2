Prosecutors said Lee Kyu-seung, an uncle of Chun's wife, LeeSoon-ja, was imprisoned Friday and charged with taking about$730,000 in bribes from a businessman for selling influence.   Prosecutors and legislators are investigating allegations ofcorruption, human rights violations, and other abuses under Chun andhis authoritarian rule.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in1980, went into rural exile last month after making a public apologyfor abuses under his seven-year rule, which ended in February.   President Roh Tae-woo, a former general and once a close ally ofChun, has distanced himself from Chun while asking the nation toforgive him. But opposition parties say they will not agree to apardon for Chun unless he appears before a National Assembly inquiry.   Opposition parties have demanded that Chun account for misdeedsby his associates and relatives. They are accused of extorting moneyfrom businesses, diverting government funds, selling influence andforcing political donations.   Chun has denied any personal corruption, but some of hisrelatives and associates have been arrested or convicted ofcorruption.   Last week, prosecutors arrested two former government ministerson corruption charges. It was the first arrest of ministers ofChun's administration.   Prosecutors have promised to expand their case into suspectedcorruption involving former government officials and Chun's aides.</TEXT></DOC>
