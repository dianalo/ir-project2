Mrs. Sisulu said she views the invitation by Bush as abreakthrough that might portend a more active U.S. role in bringingabout negotiations between South Africa's black majority and itsgovernment. He invited her last month after meeting with three otheranti-apartheid leaders visiting the United States.   Mrs. Sisulu, 71, whose family has come to symbolize the fightagainst racial segregation in South Africa, meets with Bush andState Department officials later this week. This is the first timeshe has been allowed to leave South Africa.   Because she was invited by Bush, Mrs. Sisulu told reporters, shedid not encounter difficulties getting a passport. But the documentonly allows her to travel to the United States and is only valid for31 days, she added.   Mrs. Sisulu, a nurse, is one of three joint presidents of theUnited Democratic Front, treasurer of the Women's League of theoutlawed African National Congress and a founder of the Federationof South African Women. Her husband, Walter Sisulu, has been servinga life sentence since 1964 for being one of the founders of the ANC,along with its jailed leader, Nelson Mandela.   Two of Mrs. Sisulu's five children have fled into exile to avoidimprisonment, and she served various jail terms and has been underhouse arrest and other government restrictions for 18 years.   Mrs. Sisulu declined to say what she would tell Bush, but saidthat ``we would like the outside world to help us with comprehensiveand mandatory sanctions'' in order to pressure the government.   President Reagan imposed limited economic sanctions against SouthAfrica in 1986 after his veto was overriden by Congress. Efforts byliberal Democrats in Congress to broaden the sanctions have so farfailed.   Bush, while reluctant to support additional sanctions, hasendorsed a more active U.S. role in bringing about negotiations toend the apartheid system of segregation and grant political rightsto blacks.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet nextmonth in Washington with F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to assumehis country's presidency later this year and will be the first SouthAfrican government leader on an official visit here in 30 years.   Mrs. Sisulu said that despite his promise to enact politicalreform and end the domination of 28 million blacks by 5 millionwhites, ``we see no change with de Klerk.'' His predecessor,President P.W. Botha, made similar promises and failed to fulfillthem, she added.   De Klerk should legalize the ANC and return its leaders fromexile so he can negotiate with them, she said.   Mrs. Sisulu praised former U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins, thefirst American black to hold that job, saying he had helped obtainthe release of South African children from jail. ``We are sorry tolose him,'' she said. Perkins returned here recently to head theForeign Service.</TEXT></DOC>
