(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Just before sunset, a golden glow warmsthe Big Sur coast where Highway 1 crosses Bixby Creek on a bridgeso graceful it improves its idyllic natural backdrop.   California native Richard Sears visits the area a half-dozentimes a year just to stare at the stunning scene.   ``I feel attached to this place,'' he says in a reverent tone.``I lived in Europe for 20 years. All the time I was gone, I keptdreaming about this particular highway, this particular spot.   ``That's why I came home eventually.''   Sears is not alone in his enthusiasm for the wonders ofCalifornia's 644-mile coastal highway. If you picture California inyour mind, chances are you are viewing it from Highway 1.   Maybe it's the sight of surfers silhouetted against a SantaMonica sunset, or the brightly colored fishing boats chugging outof Morro Bay. Perhaps it's the grandeur of Big Sur, or the quaintMain Street of Mendocino. If these are the jewels of the Californiacoast, Highway 1 is the necklace.   It became the nation's first scenic highway in 1964, when theseparate segments of the route were linked under the common name ofHighway 1.   The journey north begins at Dana Point in Orange County when thePacific Coast Highway peels off from Interstate 5. A chain of beachtowns makes up this land of surfboards and string bikinis: Laguna,Newport, Hermosa, Redondo, Manhattan, Sunset, Santa Monica.   Yachts take harbor at Newport Beach. Laguna Beach attractsartists. Huntington Beach is perforated with oil wells. Everywherethere are whitewashed walls of Spanish-style villas, red-tile roofsand dangling boughs of purple bougainvillea.   The highway rolls past Venice and the famous Santa Monica pieren route to Malibu, where celebrities mingle with common folk. It'sexpensive. The traffic is often jammed. The land is not stable.Grass fires threaten hillside mansions in the summer. Monster wavesdamage beachfront homes in the winter. Yet most people who livehere wouldn't trade it for nirvana.   Highway 1 passes through the lima bean fields and lemon orchardsof Ventura County as it heads up towards Santa Barbara. At Gaviota,it heads west on a journey through time that takes it from cowpastures into the space age. Giant radar domes and distant launchpads mark Vandenberg Air Force Base, the future home of the spaceshuttle.   San Luis Obispo was the site of a California mission, laterbecame a quiet college town and today is an oasis for motorists.With the Spanish-influenced architecture of its relaxed downtown,it proves an excellent tonic for those too long behind the wheel.   Ten miles west is Morro Bay, and a little farther up the coastlies San Simeon, where William Randolph Hearst built Hearst Castle.The dozens of bedrooms in the main house once welcomed the likes ofGable and Lombard, presidents and kings. The mountaintop mansion isnow a state park.   The highway now enters Big Sur, 70 miles of coast where thedramatic Santa Lucia mountains drop suddenly to the sea.   The highway dances with the mountains here, rising around apoint high over the ocean, then falling gracefully into a sweepingcurve before spinning again toward the sea.   The deepest canyons are crowned with arching concrete spansbuilt, like other parts of the highway, with the help of convictlabor from San Quentin prison.   The beauty of the 714-foot Bixby Creek Bridge belies thedifficulty of its construction from 300 tons of steel, 6,600 cubicyards of concrete and 300,000 board feet of Douglas fir used as afalsework.   Even though 1.5 million people drive through Big Sur each year,the scale of the landscape generates a feeling of isolation forsome. The greatness of the area has inspired many writers andartists, including author Henry Miller and photographer Ansel Adams.   A half-hour north of Bixby Creek sits reclusiveCarmel-By-The-Sea, and a few miles farther rests Monterey with itsonce-bustling waterfront that now features one of the world's greataquariums.   This is no longer the Cannery Row that John Steinbeckimmortalized a half-century ago. But millions still come heresearching among the crumbling piers for the ghosts of Doc and WideIda.   The highway races past Fort Ord on its way to the amusement parkat the Santa Cruz boardwalk, where a warm summer night conjures thesmell of cotton candy and the cheap thrill of a rickety woodenroller coaster.   Another 70 miles of coastline leads the highway to San Franciscowhere the route's beauty is lost is a maze of traffic untilresurfacing across the Golden Gate in Marin County. The highwayclings to the shoulders of Mount Tamalpais before reaching thefunky communities of Stinson Beach and Bolinas.   For many, a trip along Highway 1 on the north coast will seemredundant after the scenery further south. But the observant willfind extraordinary beauty in the lagoons and grasslands that havebecome refuge to myriad species, including red tail hawks andperegrine falcons.   Passing through the towns along the north coast _ Bodega Bay,Mendocino, Fort Bragg, Gualala (pronounce it wuh-lah-lah) _ it ishard to imagine one is still in the same state as the sun-'n'-surfcities of Southern California. Soon, even the Northern Californiacoast is a memory as the highway turns inland through virginredwood groves and Indian reservations.   At Leggett, the highway comes to an anti-climactic end when itmeets Highway 101, and the traveler has the option of continuing onthe more heavily traveled road _ or turning around and seeing whatHighway 1 looks like from north to south.</TEXT></DOC>
