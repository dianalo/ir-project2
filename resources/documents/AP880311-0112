However, no serious injuries were reported and most homes in thepath of the fire were saved by hundreds of firefighters battlingthe blaze, said Lawrence Winkler, information officer of theShackelford County Emergency Management team. Some firefighterssuffered minor burns.   ``It's been a miracle, so far,'' Winkler said of thefirefighting effort.   However, officials said, a cold front was expected to change thedirection of the wind today and turn the flames back toward Albany,a town of 2,400 people about 150 miles west of Dallas.   By 9 a.m., winds that had gusted to 30 mph had died down, butNational Weather Service forecasters said the calm preceded a shiftin winds along the cold front.   Army National Guard troops used bulldozers to build firebreaksto protect the town, according to Maj. Ed Komandosky, a spokesmanat the Guard state headquarters in Austin.   Earlier, the fire threatened Albany, the Shackelford Countyseat, but winds died down and the fire moved north and away fromthe town, officials at the sheriff's office in Albany said.   Texas National Guardsmen, ordered by Gov. Bill Clements to helplocal authorities, joined an estimated 15 West Texas firedepartments and members of the Texas Forest Service in fighting theblaze.   Some fire equipment was lost to the flames, mainly becausefirefighters were working in darkness, Winkler said. At timesduring the night, the blaze could be seen as far as 35 miles away,he said.   At least one house, some mobile homes and outbuildings weredestroyed during the early hours of the blaze Thursday night,authorities said.   Some children were evacuated from homes in the path of the fire,but Winkler said, ``Most people stayed there to fight the fire.''   Nervous Albany residents watched during the night as the glow ofthe approaching fire got closer, but there were no evacuations.   Families that moved away from their isolated rural homes choseto stay with friends, said Red Cross spokeswoman Cheryl Parks.   The National Weather Service said winds gusted to 30 mph in thearea around the fire Thursday night, but Winkler said the wind dieddown somewhat during the night.   Albany, which dates from about 1880, was an early supply pointon the cattle trail to Dodge City, Kan.</TEXT></DOC>
