But munis also have a darker side that may come as a surprise to some of these folks. While many individual investors who buy or sell municipal bonds just take whatever deal their brokers offer, trading is actually about as simple as haggling in a crowded bazaar.    Municipal bond prices can vary enormously from one merchant to the next. Prices frequently depend on how well the dealer knows the investor, the size of the transaction, the type of bond and how much business the dealer expects from the customer in the future. The gap between what an investor pays for a bond and what that bond would fetch if it were immediately resold can be large.    This doesn't mean investors should simply avoid municipals. Many people have had years of happy returns from municipal bonds, and munis are one of the few remaining investments that generate tax-free income.    But investors planning to go into municipal bonds, as well as bondholders who want to get out before their bonds mature, should be aware of the dangers. Those who still want to proceed may want to take a few tips from municipal bond specialists about how to avoid getting soaked in the souk.    Finding a good price can be tricky when buying or selling just about any type of bond, but pricing is especially dicey in the $765 billion municipal bond market. Even the pros have trouble keeping up with the nearly 50,000 state and local governments and municipal authorities that issue tax-free bonds and the approximately two million issues outstanding.    If anything, the problem is getting worse, not better, some money managers say, particularly for individual investors with small blocks of bonds. &quot;It's wild,&quot; says Gail P. Seneca, senior vice president for investments in the private banking division at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. &quot;Municipal bond pricing can be completely off the wall.&quot;    When Wells Fargo wanted to sell Kansas City, Kan., bonds with a face value of $100,000 this year for a client, the bank asked nine dealers for bids. The offers it got ranged from $90,872 to $94,774 -- a difference of $3,902.    Chase Manhattan Bank's U.S. private banking division called 11 bond dealers this year to sell $250,000 of New York State Dormitory Authority bonds on behalf of a client. Bruce A. Whiteford, head of the fixed-income department at Chase's private banking unit, says the high bid was $221,025, and the low was $209,072. That's a difference of $11,953.    Some municipal bond dealers insist that such gaping price differences are unusual. But several money managers say similar cases are popping up with increasing frequency.    In part, that's because many securities firms have pared trading operations or abandoned the municipal market altogether. At the same time, tax-law changes have made it less attractive for many institutional investors, such as banks and insurance companies, to buy tax-free bonds. Analysts say that has left the municipal market increasingly dominated by individuals who frequently don't realize the importance of shopping for the best price.    All of this leaves a very practical question for people attracted by the well-known allure of municipal bonds: How can the little guy possibly get a fair price?    Municipal bond specialists offer the following suggestions for individuals who'd like to even the odds:    Get professional help. For investors with less than $25,000, and those who may need to sell their bonds before maturity, many advisers say to forget individual bonds. Instead, they say, small investors should buy through mutual funds and unit investment trusts.    &quot;You can be penalized very heavily for selling small amounts of bonds,&quot; says S.E. Canaday Jr., a vice president at John Nuveen andamp; Co., which offers unit investment trusts and mutual funds. &quot;Many major firms won't bid at all on amounts under $100,000.&quot;    The drawback to the trusts and funds, though, is that the fees they impose cut into an investor's return.    Buy new issues and hang on. Prices on new issues tend to vary less from dealer to dealer than do prices on older bonds traded in the &quot;secondary,&quot; or resale, market. Holding on to them until they mature eliminates resale problems entirely.    To increase the chance that an investor can actually hang on until maturity, municipal specialists recommend bonds that come due in less than seven years. The difference in yield between such intermediate-term bonds and those with longer maturities is relatively small.    For those who think they may need to cash a bond before maturity, municipal specialists suggest large new issues of state and local governments that sell bonds frequently. The reason, they say, is that it's easier to sell such issues in the secondary market. For example, many New York, Florida and California bonds trade actively, but a $500,000 issue by a small water and sewer district may not trade for months.    Get several quotes. When buying or selling, don't be content with just phoning national brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman Hutton. Sometimes smaller regional firms will provide significantly better prices on issues they specialize in. A few examples: Lebenthal andamp; Co. and Samuel A. Ramirez andamp; Co., both in New York; Tucker Anthony in Boston; Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., a unit of Legg Mason in Baltimore, and Stone andamp; Youngberg in San Francisco.    When selling, don't talk only to the dealer who sold you the bond. Even dealers who value your business highly may not have a ready buyer for the bond you want to sell and thus won't offer as high a price as some other dealer who knows where to resell the bonds in a hurry.    Do your homework. &quot;If you present yourself as a bozo who doesn't know anything, you're at risk of getting ripped off by the broker,&quot; says Glen T. Insley, fixed-income director at One Federal Asset Management in Boston. &quot;But if you present yourself as being willing to check the price or having a knowledge of what the price should be, and you make it clear you're looking to develop an ongoing client relationship with the broker, then you have a better chance&quot; of getting a good price.    ---   Friday's Market Activity    The bond market hit a minor milestone as yields on long-term Treasury bonds fell below 8% to their lowest levels in more than two years.    The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond ended at 7.98%, the lowest closing yield for the bond since April 8, 1987, according to Technical Data Global Markets Group. The bond's price was quoted late at 109 31/32, up 15/32 from late Thursday.    The finish below 8% is expected to stoke the already raging bullish sentiment in the market, bond traders say, as will fresh evidence of a moderating U.S. economy and expectations that the Federal Reserve will ease credit policy further.    The tone in the market &quot;seems to suggest that people believe the rally will continue and yields will continue to fall,&quot; says Joel Marver, chief fixed-income analyst at Technical Data. All eyes, he says, are on the bond futures market, where contracts are expected to reach new highs this week.    But Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh, says the market's strength &quot;is justified only if you think we are in a recession, not a mere downturn.&quot; Whether the economy has entered a recession isn't yet known, although recent data show that economic growth slowed considerably in the second quarter.    Contributing to the market's tone Friday were rumors a National Association of Purchasing Management survey due for release tomorrow will show more weakness. Traders say there was talk that the purchasing agents' index for July will come in at 45% or 46%, below the 48.8% June level. An index under 50% implies a slowing economy.    The latest 10-year notes were quoted late in the day at 108 17/32 to yield 7.85%. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.86% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.10%, while the discount rate on six-month bills was 7.51% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.89%.    Other major markets trailed Treasurys:    --Municipal bonds were unchanged to 1/4 of a point higher. Among new issues expected to be priced this week is California's $3 billion of 1989 revenue anticipation notes.    --Corporate bonds closed 3/8 higher. Some traders say the new-issue market could get busy this week as companies rush to lock in low yields ahead of the Treasury's huge August debt auction.    --Mortgage-backed bond prices rose slightly. For example, Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for August delivery ended at 99 5/32, up 3/32 from Thursday. </TEXT></DOC>
