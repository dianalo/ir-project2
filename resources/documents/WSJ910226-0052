In an appeal by an anti-abortion organization, OperationRescue, and its leaders, the justices agreed to review theprincipal legal strategy used by women's groups andabortion-rights groups to obtain court injunctions to haltprotests that block access to abortion clinics.</LP><TEXT>   The strategy, used by abortion-rights groups in more thantwo dozen cases throughout the U.S., is to sue the protestersunder a Reconstruction-era civil rights law, part of the KuKlux Klan Act, passed in 1871. The law permits individuals tofile civil lawsuits to stop conspiracies that discriminateagainst the individuals and that violate their civil rights.   The law requires those who use it to prove there wasdiscrimination against a class or group of people. In thepast, the law has been used most often by blacks to challengeconspiracies against them based on their race.   But the Supreme Court has never said whether the 1871 lawapplies to gender discrimination against women, and that isthe issue the court yesterday agreed to decide.   A number of federal district and appeals courts have ruledthat protests by Operation Rescue and other groupsdiscriminate against women as a group and deprive them oftheir constitutional right to travel freely from one state toanother to seek health care. The right to travel isimplicated because of evidence presented by abortion clinicsthat many of their patients are women from other states whoare unable or unwilling to obtain services where they live.   The high court agreed to review a September 1990 ruling bya federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., that upheld aninjunction issued by a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. Theinjunction was issued after the district judge concluded thatdemonstrations in 1989 against an abortion clinic in FallsChurch, Va., and other Virginia clinics, were a conspiracy todiscriminate against women seeking abortions and to deprivethe women of the right to travel. The district court ruledthat the protests violated the 1871 civil rights law.   The court's decision to hear the case was puzzling becausethe court turned down a virtually identical appeal in May1990. In that case, a federal appeals court in New York hadupheld an injunction against Operation Rescue under the samecivil rights law. It might not become fully apparent why thecourt agreed to hear the second appeal until the justicesissue a decision in the case next year.   Lawyers representing Operation Rescue said the Richmondappeals court's decision conflicted with decisions of otherappeals courts and should be reviewed for that reason.Yesterday, the lawyers expressed &quot;guarded optimism&quot; at thehigh court's action, according to a statement by ChristianAdvocates Serving Evangelism, an anti-abortion legal defensegroup.   But women's groups never conceded there was any splitamong the appeals courts. Alison Wetherfield, legal directorof NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, said, &quot;We hopethey're taking this case to emphasize that the law protectswomen's rights.&quot;   Operation Rescue has closed its national office and gone&quot;underground,&quot; in part to avoid costly lawsuits against theorganization and its directors. Anti-abortion groups say thischange in status won't diminish the campaign to block accessto clinics.   In a few cases, Operation Rescue efforts have led tolawsuits under the federal Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations law, which allows for tripled damage awards.Ms. Wetherfield said those cases have been rare and haveusually involved allegations of &quot;terrorism,&quot; such asbombings.
