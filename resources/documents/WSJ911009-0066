The transformation, performed with rats, suggests thatsomeday surgeons may be able to mold a patient's own softtissues into pieces of bone of exactly the desired shape andsize for hip and jaw replacements, as well as for otherreconstructions of the skeleton. The new-made bone would comecomplete with its own built-in blood supply, overcoming aproblem that currently hampers the use of bone from cadaversfor reconstruction of bones damaged by accident or disease.</LP><TEXT>   The St. Louis rat experiments, which were funded in partby Monsanto Co., point the way to the first practicalapplication of a phenomenon discovered more than 45 yearsago, according to a report by plastic surgeons Roger K.Khouri and Basem Koudsi at Washington University medicalschool in St. Louis and cell biologist Hari Reddi of JohnsHopkins Medical School in Baltimore. The report was publishedin this week's Journal of the American Medical Association.   The researchers explained that in 1945 scientists foundthat bone contained a mysterious substance, dubbedosteogenin, that induced rabbit muscle tissue to turn boney.In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, Dr. Reddi and other expertsin bone cell biology began finding that there are as many asseven different &quot;bone morphogenic proteins&quot; in the mysteriousosteogenin.   Surgeons, however, ran into problems when they attemptedto trigger formation of new bone in patients by injecting thebone-inducing factors directly into soft tissues in the spotswhere bone replacement was needed. The soft tissues,themselves, often were scarred, inflamed or diseased, thusunsuitable for bone transformation. Moreover, Dr. Khouriexplained, there was no way to control the shape and extentof tissue that was transformed into bone.   In the rat experiments, the surgeons loosened a tiny flapof muscle from a hind leg of each animal and clamped a tinysilicone rubber mold around the flap, which remained attachedto the animal for its blood supply. The muscle flap insidethe mold was then injected with a purified bone morphogenicprotein and implanted back into animal.   Ten days later, the researchers said, the mold was removedand opened. Except for a tiny fringe around the edges, themuscle flap had been totally transformed to bone. The newbone followed the shape of the mold exactly, producing thefemur head of a tiny rat hip bone.   In an interview, Dr. Khouri said he expects the techniquemight be used in humans &quot;pretty soon,&quot; perhaps in a matter ofmonths. The first human uses might be for repairing damagedmandibles in the jaw or damaged leg bones such as those thatoccur in bone cancer, he said.   Dr. Khouri said that genetic engineers are now producingpurified versions of the various bone morphogenic proteins,opening the way to more experiments. He explained that he andMonsanto are interested in developing ways to use the bonemorphogenic proteins while leaving the production of theproteins to others. Dr. Reddi, who is familiar with thebiotechnology companies working on the genetic engineering ofthe proteins, couldn't be reached to elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
