Generale des Eaux, which signed an agreementto overhaul and expand the infrastructure of Ho Chi MinhCity, formerly Saigon.

Meanwhile, a planning official said Vietnam is tighteningforeign-exchange controls to stabilize its currency, thedong. He told a Japanese business mission that a stablecurrency is needed to attract foreign investment.                                                                                                          GOLF AS HEALTH RISK IN JAPAN                                                                                                          Golf may be causing serious health hazards in Japanbecause of the pesticides used on golf courses, a group ofdoctors and dentists said. Of the 1,436 patients treated bythe group for pesticide poisoning between June 1990 and lastMay, 536, or more than 37%, were employees of golf courses,amateur golfers or people living close to the links, the70,000-member organization reported. The rest of the casesinvolved farmers who directly handled agricultural chemicalsor people who ingested the chemicals. Nearly 15 millionpeople, or more than 12% of Japan's population, play thesport.                                                                                                          KUWAITI WAR PAYMENTS                                                                                                          Kuwait's finance minister said the emirate will make thelast payment at year end of its share in the cost of thePersian Gulf War. Nasser al-Rawdan told the Sawt al-Kuwaitnewspaper that by making the payment of $700 million, Kuwaitwould have paid its full share of $23 billion. That figurewas $1 billion higher than previous estimates by seniorgovernment figures, and the reason for the discrepancy wasn'tclear. Recent U.S. press reports have said the Kuwaitis arelagging behind in their payments.                                                                                                          HUNGARY'S CURRENCY PLAN   The Hungarian National Bank wants to switch Dec. 9 to amore flexible system of quoting hard currencies against thenational currency, the forint, MTI news agency said.

PROTECTING ASIA'S ENVIRONMENT                                                                                                          Governments in the fast-growing Asia Pacific region shouldestablish long-term environmental protection policies,executives of the region's electric utilities said at ameeting in Hong Kong. &quot;It's far less costly to have anenvironmental program in place before the power stations arebuilt than after,&quot; said D.R. Deane, vice president of theAssociation of the Electricity Industry of East Asia and theWestern Pacific, an organization of 28 electricity companiesin 12 nations.

The pacts are due to be signed Dec. 16.   The accords mostly cover economic issues, but they spellout that each country's &quot;final objective is to become amember of the Community,&quot; the EC commission said in astatement.   The accords come after months of difficult negotiations,which occasionally ground to a standstill over EC membernations' insistence on trade barriers to protect their steeland coal, textile and farm industries.   The three East European nations will have 10 years to openup their markets. The accords also offer trade concessionsand more access to information about EC politicaldecision-making.
