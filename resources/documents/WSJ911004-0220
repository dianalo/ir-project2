The German bank's move represents the first directchallenge to the London Stock Exchange's SEAQ Internationalsystem for cross-border securities trading.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to marking the start of a battle between twosystems, it comes as part of a drive by banks and brokeragefirms in continental Europe to chip away at London's positionas Europe's dominant financial center by increasing theefficiency and rapidity with which securities can be tradedon their home market.   SEAQ, which stands for Stock Exchange Automated Quotation,provides trading facilities in a wide range of internationalsecurities, including 27 major German shares.   Geared to the needs of large traders, one of its majoradvantages is the temporary confidentiality it offersregarding trades in large blocks of securities to give themarket time to absorb them without provoking major priceswings.   However, settlement of transactions done through SEAQmostly has to be effected on stock exchanges in the countriesconcerned, representing a potential risk.   IBIS, by contrast, though potentially a smaller marketthan SEAQ, has the advantage that it is also a settlementsystem. Launched in Germany in April, it permits dealing inall 30 shares that make up the DAX German stock index, plus30 widely traded bonds.   &quot;IBIS fulfills all of the expectations of a true tradingsystem, namely market transparency and a high degree ofliquidity,&quot; Hypo-Bank's executive vice president in charge ofsecurities trading, Josef F. Wertschulte, told a newsconference.   By establishing IBIS in London, Mr. Wertschulte said,Hypo-Bank, which is not a member of SEAQ International,wishes &quot;to provide U.K. institutional investors with instantaccess to the most liquid German shares through a direct linkto the German equity market.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
