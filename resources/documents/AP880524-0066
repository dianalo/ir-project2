Last week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the zoo wouldnot be allowed to display the two pandas, on loan from China, untilthe document issue was resolved. The zoo, which is scheduled toopen the panda exhibit today, was given 10 days to come up with thedocumentation.   However, FWS spokesman David Klinger said Monday that lawyersfor the zoo gave the service a copy of the Chinese export permitover the weekend and appear to be making a good-faith effort todeliver the original documents.   ``We're not going to stand in the way of them opening theirexhibit this week,'' said Klinger.   Klinger said the pandas were taken out of the wild in Chinanearly two months after Dec. 6, 1983, the date pandas were put onan international conservation group's endangered species list. Thatmeans the animals do not qualify for an exemption under a 1975convention signed by 95 countries, including China and the UnitedStates, he said.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Surrogate Mothers, Including Baby M's, Would Ban Baby Brokers</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould is one of 17surrogate mothers who have joined forces in a campaign to drivebaby brokers in 12 states out of business.   ``Try to help shut these places down,'' Whitehead-Gould, whoseprecedent-setting ``Baby M'' story was the subject of a networktelevision movie this week, said at a press conference Monday.

Four percent of the stream mileage sampled in 1985 and 1986 inmid-Atlantic areas was acidic and showed chemical characteristicsthat made it unlikely all the acidity could have come from naturalsources, an Environmental Protection Agency study concluded.   The study, made available Monday, said the proportion reached 10percent on forested ridges inland from coastal lowlands.   ``The lack of plausible sources of neutral salts in thesestreams makes it likely'' that their acidity is ``probablyassociated with atmospheric acid deposition,'' said the study.   Courtney Riordan, head of acid rain research for EPA, said thenew findings show there has been ``an expansion of the geographicarea'' known to be influenced by acid rain.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Rock Groups Join Corporate Leaders In Youth Jobs Effort</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of some of the nation's most popularmusical groups are joining corporate leaders in calling onAmerica's youth to prepare for a future in the workforce.   ``We've been telling them to `Say no to drugs' and other things.We want them to say `yes' to staying in school and being a successat anything they want to do,'' Barry McDaniels, member of the rapgroup Run-DMC, said at a press conference Monday.
