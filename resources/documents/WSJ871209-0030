The judge's ruling is a blow to cities and states with high black and Hispanic populations which claim they've been shortchanged in census counts.    The 1980 suit, brought by New York City and New York State against the U.S. census bureau and other parties, was one of 52 following the 1980 census. New York City and New York state, like other municipalities and states that filed suit, argued that by not adjusting figures to include undercounted populations like minority groups, they lost congressional seats and federal funding.    Last month, the Reagan administration said it wouldn't adjust the figures in 1990, arguing it would produce an inaccurate picture of the U.S. population.    U.S. District Judge John E. Sprizzo said he didn't support adjustment because plaintiffs &quot;must not only prove that there was a disproportionate undercount, but also that there is a practicable method that would more accurately reflect the population of the U.S,&quot; and the plaintiffs weren't able to do that. </TEXT></DOC>
