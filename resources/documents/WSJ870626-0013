While the measure would enable a wide range of U.S. manufacturers to bring actions against subsidization by foreign consortia, it is primarily aimed at Airbus Industrie.    &quot;This amendment is designed to make sure that we do not let slip through the cracks an unfair trade practice which is becoming increasingly significant in international trade,&quot; said Sen. Brock Adams (D., Wash.), a sponsor of the provision. &quot;In Washington state, we know first-hand how significant it can be when an international consortium, like Airbus, is permitted to continue to benefit from subsidies from several foreign governments.&quot;    Airbus -- the commercial aircraft maker sponsored by the governments of West Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Spain -- recently has begun making gains in the U.S. market. Under the measure, U.S. aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., would be able to seek the imposition of a countervailing duty to offset the Airbus subsidies.    The amendment would require that the consortia members be treated as one company for purposes of determining the subsidy attributed to the products. Under current law, it is questionable whether the subsidies contributed from different countries could be accumulated.    Countervailing-duty laws are designed to ensure that foreign products don't unfairly compete with domestic goods. A domestic manufacturer can ask for the imposition of a duty equal to the amount of a foreign government's subsidy for a product.    U.S. aircraft makers are concerned that the four Airbus sponsors are contributing $8 billion to $10 billion in subsidies to the group. The House trade bill passed earlier this year doesn't contain a similar measure, but hearings began in the House this month on Airbus's competition with U.S. companies.    In other action on the Senate floor yesterday, the Senate approved an amendment to require the U.S. to initiate an investigation into Japanese barriers to competition in construction projects. That measure aims to help U.S. companies win bids on the $6.5 billion Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan. American companies have complained that the airport won't award contracts to U.S. concerns.    In a move designed to ward off an amendment that would risk a veto by President Reagan, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) agreed to have his panel approve a bill to aid the battered textile industry. Lawmakers from textile states then assured Sen. Bentsen that they wouldn't try to attach such a measure to the omnibus trade package.    The Senate will continue voting on amendments today, and is expected to complete work on the bill sometime next month. </TEXT></DOC>
