DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sometimes it's hard to tell who's really ontrial in the federal racketeering case against Rep. Mario Biaggi,D-N.Y., and six other men.   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Robert Garcia aren't on trial _ oreven charged with wrongdoing _ but a key prosecution witness spentmuch of last week telling jurors how he made at least $30,000 inillegal campaign contributions to D'Amato and helped pay $80,000 toGarcia.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III isn't on trial either, but thewitness _ former Wedtech Vice Chairman Mario Moreno _ alsotestified the company paid an additional $800,000 to a close friendand former lawyer of the attorney general ``for his influence withEd Meese.''   Defense lawyers, in their cross-examination of Moreno, havehammered at his admitted illegal acts in their effort to prove thatWedtech ``corrupted an entire administration'' and didn't need tobribe Biaggi for his help.   Biaggi, his eldest son, his law partner and four others arecharged with turning Wedtech, a South Bronx defense contractor,into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars toobtain and then hold onto government contracts.   Wedtech, currently in bankruptcy proceedings, grew from a smallmachine shop into a $100-million-a-year business through a seriesof no-bid contracts set aside for minority-controlled companies.   Moreno has linked the defendants to numerous payoff and fraudschemes and also admitted personally stealing $1.5 million incompany funds. Moreno is among four ex-Wedtech officialscooperating with the government in return for leniency on state andfederal charges to which they pleaded guilty.   A D'Amato spokesman branded Moreno's testimony ``ridiculous,''and prosecutors have said the senator will testify for thegovernment.   The prosecution contends that Biaggi enlisted the help ofD'Amato and other politicians to help secure no-bid contracts forWedtech, then extorted millions of dollars in Wedtech stock as apayoff.   Moreno claimed Wedtech paid $80,000 to Garcia at the request ofthe congressman and his wife for ``political favors and politicalintroductions.'' Garcia later denied the allegation through aspokesman.   Moreno also testified that Wedtech paid $800,000 to SanFrancisco lawyer E. Robert Wallach, a close friend of the attorneygeneral, ``for his influence with Ed Meese.''   According to the witness, Wallach said he had gotten Meese, thenpresidential counselor, to intercede for Wedtech in contractnegotiations with the Pentagon and Commerce Department.   Moreno also said he and another Wedtech official offered Wallach$200,000 to fix the Wedtech investigation. Wallach said ``he wouldtake a look and told us we were not going to go to jail,'' Morenotestified, adding that Wallach never got back to them and the moneywas never paid.   Moreno also said Wedtech paid: $130,000 to two Bronx bankers inearly 1984 for helping the company obtain a $500,000 cash loan _ at$150,000 interest over three months _ from a Bronx businessman; anadditional $15,000 to a Manhattan banker Manhattan banker whohelped them launder the $500,000 cash; $10,000-$15,000 over sixyears to a a manager at Consolidated Edison, a local utility, ``tohave Con Edison on our side whenever we needed it''; and $100,000to two Teamsters officials in 1985 to settle a dispute with anotherunion.   The witness will continue his testimony Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
