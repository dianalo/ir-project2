Bell Atlantic Corp.'s profit rose 6%, aided primarily by a strong regional economy and new business telephone-line growth. Earnings at Contel Corp. surged 81%, mostly because of overall increases in telephone operations and a $25 million charge that depressed results in the year-ago quarter. Pacific Telesis Group's earnings improved 5.3%, as non-telephone operations posted profit for the first time and basic telephone business grew generally across the board.    Modest gains were posted by Nynex Corp. and U S West Inc. Earnings growth at Nynex was partly offset by investments, resulting in a 2% profit increase. At U S West, profits rose 2.1% as regulatory actions constrained telephone operations.    Bell Atlantic   Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, attributed much of its gain to improvements in the telephone business-customer segment and a growing mid-Atlantic economy.    Revenue was flat at about $2.61 billion, compared with $2.59 billion a year ago. The company was hurt by regulatory action that resulted in a reduction in revenue by $46.7 million and adjustments for the sale of certain non-telephone business operations.    Basic telephone business revenue increased 2% to $2.47 billion from $2.42 billion, while non-telephone operation revenue slumped 17% to $137.3 million, compared with $165.2 million.    In the business segment, new telephone lines increased by 7.1% and call volume, reflected in minutes of use, rose 11.5%. Bell Atlantic installed 105,000 new telephone lines, both business and residential, for an increase of 3.2% and a total of $16.3 million.    Efforts to control costs helped keep operating expenses down. In the third quarter, expenses increased 3.9% to $2.04 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Bell Atlantic shares rose $1.375 to close at $73.375.    Contel   Compared with year-ago results, Contel earnings would have climbed 5% if the 1987 period hadn't included a $25 million charge for cost overruns in the Atlanta company's federal systems sector.    Third-quarter profit benefited primarily from strong growth in the basic telephone business, which includes cellular operations. Profit from continuing operations for the telephone sector increased 12% to $77.7 million from $69.6 million a year earlier.    The telephone sector was aided by a 4% increase in new telephone lines and a rise in minutes of use on long-distance services of about 10%.    Contel was also aided by a turnaround in its federal systems sector, which posted profit from continuing operations of $2.4 million, compared with a loss in continuing operations of $22.9 million. Federal systems group also reported a $210 million contract backlog as of the end of the third quarter.    Revenue overall rose 7.7% to $767.9 million, compared with $713 million a year ago. Prior year results have been restated to reflect the pooling of interests of recently acquired companies. Revenue from telephone operations increased about 6% to $559.9 million from $528.5 million. The federal systems sector posted revenue of $80.6 million, up 9% from $73.7 million.    In Big Board trading, Contel shares closed at $37.625, unchanged.    Pacific Telesis   Pacific Telesis's net benefited from gains in its cellular and paging business, increased local long-distance use, and new telephone lines.    Minutes of use for local long-distance calls jumped 8.9%, profit in the cellular and paging business surged 73%, and new telephone lines grew 4.2%.    Non-telephone operations, which include cellular and paging businesses, broke into the black in the quarter and revenue increased 2.5% to $375 million, from $366 million. The company, based in San Francisco, wouldn't give specific earning results for the entire sector, but it did disclose profits for the cellular and paging unit.    Earnings for that unit, called PacTel Personal Communications, increased 73% to $9 million from $5.2 million a year earlier. Revenue grew 43.1% to $98.2 million, compared with $68.6 million. The number of cellular customers increased 55.7% to 232,000.    Overall revenue rose about 2% to $2.38 billion from $2.34 billion. Revenue from basic telephone service increased 2.7% to $805 million, while revenue from long distance calls made in the same area code climbed 4.6% to $581 million.    Pacific Telesis installed 207,000 new customer lines, a 4.2% increase, for a total of 12.95 million access lines.    Costs and expenses rose 3.9% to $1.75 billion from $1.69 billion.    Pacific Telesis shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $31 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Nynex   At Nynex, continued investments on non-telephone businesses cut into earnings growth in the third quarter.    Revenue increased 3.2% to $3.18 billion from $3.08 billion a year ago. Revenue from long distance calls in the same area code climbed 6.6% to $367 million from $344 million. Local service revenue was flat at about $1.41 billion, compared with $1.40 billion in the year-ago quarter.    New customer lines grew 3.5% in the third quarter. Nynex, based in New York, installed 194,000 access lines for a total of $14.8 million.    Costs rose 5% to $2.6 billion from $2.4 billion in the quarter.    In Big Board trading yesterday, Nynex shares rose 50 cents to close at $66.625.    U S West   U S West posted a modest profit gain, largely because of state and federal regulatory constraints on earnings.    Revenue for the third quarter, however, increased 7.3% to $2.29 billion from $2.13 billion. Revenue on long distance telephone service in the same area code soared 24.4% to $383.3 million, compared with $308 million. Access charge revenue rose 6.7% to $676.3 million from $633.9 million.    U S West, based in Denver, also had increases in minutes-of-use and new telephone lines. Minutes-of-use rose 8.2% to 8.5 million from 7.87 million, while new customer telephone lines increased 2.3% to 11.8 million, signalling changes in the economy.    But profits for telephone operations slumped 5.1% to $254.3 million from $267.9 million, largely reflecting rate reductions and other rules imposed by government agencies.    U S West shares rose $1.125 to close at $57.75 in Big Board trading yesterday.    ---                            1988             1987                        in      per      in      per     %                      millions share   millions share   chg.
