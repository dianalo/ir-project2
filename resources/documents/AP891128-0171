Among the chief reasons: a large inventory of unsold homes inmany parts of the country, falling mortgage rates and expectationsof cuts to come, and a relative decline in the age 25 to 34homebuying population.   In fact, the mid-20s to mid-30s age group that produced a bulgeof demand and higher prices in the 1980s is now shrinking as apercentage of the population, although the impact on housing willbe delayed until late in the decade.   At the same time, the age group 65 and older is growing larger,and could be a cause of more family-size houses coming on themarket, a consequence of that age category's tendency to trade downin search of convenience over space.   How far mortgage rates will fall is debatable, but the trend islower and housing forecasters say it will continue into 1990.   Three economists speaking at the annual convention of theNational Association of Realtors in Dallas this month agreed thatthe first half of the next decade would be characterized by fallinginterest rates.   The national average commitment rate for conventional loans, indouble digits through much of the 1980s, had fallen to 9.79 percentearly this month, and loans of a half-percentage point below thatalready have developed.   The improved climate is reflected in more favorable home-buyingattitudes measured by the University of Michigan. In the Octobersurvey, 26 percent of those interviewed mentioned the availabilityof good buys. Should that percentage be maintained for an entirequarter it would be a 30-year record.   Internal changes in the mortgage market might also help would-bebuyers find the best possible rates. While there will be fewerthrift institutions in the 1990s, the amount of money available formortgages might actually grow.   One reason for the expectation, according to speakers at therealtors' convention, is the prospect of greater participation inthe market by the Federal National Mortgage Association and theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   This secondary market, as it is called, will absorb a muchlarger share of mortgages in the 1990s, according to John Tuccillo,the realtors' chief economist. He also expects more overseas moneyto flow into the home mortgage markets.   In addition, it is expected that more stress will be aimed atresolving the financing problems of low and moderate-income housingas a result of provisions in the Financial Institutions Reform,Recovery and Enforcement Act.   Under FIRREA's affordable housing program, each federal homeloan bank will subsidize interest rates on advances to memberinstitutions making long-term loans on such housing.   ``There will be a real emphasis to squeeze the (mortgagefinance) system down to the low-income portion of the housingsector,'' Tuccillo said.   Whatever the consequences of demographic and market conditionsnow taking shape, there is little likelihood of prices soaringduring the 1990s, as they did in many areas during the 1980s.   At the beginning of 1980, for instance, the price of a typicalstarter home was $50,000. Realtor records show that in the thirdquarter of this year a comparable house sold for $80,700.   While convention speakers said they expected houses willcontinue to appreciate, most looked for much more stability thanexisted in the 1980s. And if interest rates remain below 10percent, it creates a buying combination.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday, Nov. 29</NOTE></DOC>
