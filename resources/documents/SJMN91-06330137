The entire world is grazing over breakfast. Cerealmanufacturers have had a hard sell. It's never been easy to get people to rollout of bed and let their heads fall into a trough of dried grain.;   Whencereal was just for kids, they were told it would dance in their dishes, makethem smarter, jump higher, build a fire in their tummies, and keep thebuzzards from hovering over their heads at the bus stop. When that didn'tconvince them to eat breakfast, cereal companies packed plastic cars, balsaairplanes, code rings and the Queen of England's honor guards in the bottom ofboxes as incentives.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CEREAL GIVES US THAT CERTAIN DEFINITION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Bombeck, author of several books and occasional television personality, is asyndicated columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Then they went after the adult market and the incentives changed. Buy a boxof General Mills' Total and you'll get a magazine on money tips, on retirementplanning and cutting taxes. A Kellogg's box of Just Right will earn youbooklets on tennis and golf. Other cereals offer everything from flower bulbsto address tags. Boxes of Ralston Purina's Honey Almond Delight even offertrips to the Caribbean and Colorado.;   Marketing people spend a bundletargeting their markets, but I've always had a theory: You are what you eat.You tell me a brand of cereal, and I'll give you a profile of who eats it.;  Take Mueslix -- please. Who would eat a cereal that sounds like nasalcongestion? The buyer who comes to mind is pale. Very pale. He wears earthshoes and never buttons his coat in the winter. He thinks Demi Moore is ahouse paint and gives fruitcakes for Christmas.;   Eaters of oat cereals lookat an egg as if it has a pin that, when removed, blows up a building. Theyhave &quot;Thank You For Not Smoking&quot; signs in their showers. If they're mothers,they dress all their children in matching prints.;   Bran people rotate theirtires regularly and call Angela Lansbury to ask her questions about theirheadache remedy. They iron the backs of their shirts.;   Hot cereal disciplesmake their beds every day. They collect matchbook covers and display them in afishbowl. They are early for dental appointments and work crossword puzzles inairline magazines and return them to the seat pocket.;   The people who eatcereals coated with sugar, dripped in honey and drowning in raisins and driedfruit are fun-loving adventurers. They launder garments that say &quot;Dry CleanOnly&quot; and carry the same handbag winter and summer. They are kind to theirmothers.;   What cereal do I eat? Guess.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Erma Bombeck column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911125  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  13B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  447  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, November 25, 199100330137,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
