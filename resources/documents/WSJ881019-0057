Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ISS MLL </CO><IN> SCR STK BON TNM </IN><G> JUS SEC </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. attorney for Manhattan issued a &quot;target letter&quot; to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., formally indicating that federal prosecutors are likely to seek an indictment soon from the grand jury that has been investigating the firm for nearly two years.    In the letter, believed to have been issued early yesterday, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani told Drexel that the firm is being investigated by the grand jury for possible violations of securities fraud, mail and wire fraud and racketeering statutes. The letter gives Drexel a final opportunity to convince Mr. Giuliani, the U.S. attorney in charge of the case, and higher officials in the Justice Department that criminal charges shouldn't be filed.    Junk-bond prices hardly budged as a result of the target-letter announcement, which ran on the Dow Jones News Service at 2:47 p.m. yesterday, while several of the &quot;deal&quot; stocks involving Drexel slipped in a rising stock market.    As previously reported, target letters were issued last month to Michael Milken, Drexel's chief of junk-bond operations; Mr. Milken's brother Lowell; Cary Maultasch, a Drexel trader; James Dahl, a Drexel bond salesman; and Bruce Newberg, a former Drexel trader. It was unclear at the time whether Drexel itself would receive a letter.    The issuance of a target letter to Drexel indicates that, for all practical purposes, the criminal investigation of the firm is complete and that prosecutors are prepared to go to trial. The receipt of the letter now turns up the heat on Drexel and its attorneys.    The target letter's expected arrival has already triggered negotiations between Drexel lawyers and the U.S. attorney in an attempt to fend off an indictment, according to individuals familiar with the talks. Drexel's attorneys are understood to have met with Mr. Giuliani and others on Monday, but so far there has been no discussion of a settlement.    The Milken brothers and Mr. Maultasch were also named as defendants in the Securities and Exchange Commission's massive civil securities-fraud case against Drexel and others on Sept. 7. Mr. Newberg, who left Drexel earlier this year, was indicted in August in an alleged tax-fraud scheme involving Princeton/Newport L.P. Since receiving his letter, Mr. Dahl has received immunity in return for his testimony before a federal grand jury.    Frederick Joseph, Drexel's chief executive officer, told more than half of Drexel's 10,000 employees of the target letter by telephone hookup yesterday, according to a Drexel spokesman. The spokesman said that Drexel had been advised it is a target of a grand jury investigation looking into &quot;alleged violations of the federal criminal laws.&quot; He added, &quot;According to the staff of the U.S. attorney, no determination has been made by the U.S. attorney to seek an indictment. Drexel believes that any such indictment would be unwarranted and unfair.&quot;    But criminal lawyers say that once target letters are issued, a recommendation that the grand jury issue indictments is all but a foregone conclusion.    In addition to telling its own employees, yesterday Drexel disclosed the target letter in an SEC filing in connection with the Interco Inc. bid. Interco shares slid 87.5 cents a share to close at $70.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Interco is the subject of a $74-a-share hostile takeover bid from the Rales brothers of Washington; Drexel is underwriting about $1.38 billion of preferred stock in that offer. About 44% of those funds are the firm's own money to complete the financing.    Another Drexel-related takeover-play stock also fell. Shares of Macmillan Inc., which is trying to complete a leveraged buy-out with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., eased 50 cents a share to $88.25. In the Macmillan deal, as previously reported, Drexel has said it can privately place or underwrite a public offering of debt securities totaling as much as $960 million. Of that, $230 millon would be used to the repay a KKR bridge loan and the rest would go to reduce bank debt.    Some Drexel clients argued that the target-letter news would have little impact on their dealings with the firm. When you buy high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, &quot;you're not buying Drexel's credit, you're buying the credit of a company for which they're doing the financing,&quot; said Gerald Unterman, a principal at Solomon Asset Management, a New York money-management firm. &quot;It's a non-event.&quot;    Several arbitragers and money managers contend that the possibility of indictments is already factored into the markets. &quot;I don't know what they can do now that the Street doesn't expect,&quot; said one player of deal stocks.    Any criminal charges that may be filed by the U.S. attorney against Drexel and other defendants are considered more serious than the civil charges filed by the SEC, carrying as they do the possibility of steep fines, prison terms for the individuals and major damage to reputations.    If criminal charges are ultimately filed, Drexel and the other potential defendants may also face racketeering charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. RICO charges, used against businesses suspected of repeated illegal acts, carry enormous potential financial penalties, including automatic forfeiture of all profits tainted by a racketeering enterprise and triple damages. Such damages could strip Drexel of many millions of dollars.    Some criminal lawyers said they were surprised that Drexel had received a target letter. Many attorneys had believed that prosecutors would follow their approach in the Princeton/Newport case, in which the goverment indicted five of the firm's general partners but didn't indict the firm itself.    Defense attorneys for Drexel and others downplayed the letter. &quot;The U.S. attorney is using maximum pressure to get (Drexel) to cooperate,&quot; one lawyer said. The letter is merely &quot;an invitation to discuss the matter, a neat little vehicle to catch your attention,&quot; the attorney said.    Federal disclosure laws require a bidder to disclose in tender-offer documents anything that may be material to shareholders. In a filing last month, the Rales group said it was advised by Drexel that the investment banking firm had produced documents &quot;pursuant to subpoenas&quot; connected with the grand jury investigation being conducted by the U.S. attorney and that certain Drexel employees had appeared before the grand jury.    In yesterday's filing, the Rales group amended that statement to say that the group was advised that Drexel and several key employees &quot;are targets of a grand jury investigation . . . with respect to certain alleged violations of the federal criminal laws, including but not limited to, securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and racketeering.&quot; But the Rales amendment emphasized that no decision has been made to seek an indictment.    Separately, attorneys for Drexel and other defendants in the SEC case are expected to ask a federal appeals court today to disqualify Judge Milton Pollack from presiding over the SEC case and 13 other insider trading-related civil suits. As previously reported, the judge on Monday refused to remove himself from the cases.    Meanwhile, Judge Pollack is scheduled to hear arguments from lawyers for Drexel and other defendants tomorrow afternoon in opposition to a broad stay the judge issued last month on the lawyers' ability to compel pretrial testimony from witnesses. The judge has refused to permit the defense attorneys to begin compelling oral testimony before late November.    The lawyers are expected to argue that they should be allowed to begin taking testimony from certain witnesses immediately.    ---   Kevin G. Salwen contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
