But efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil in the1990s will probably involve a different mix of programs thanwere instigated after the 1970s oil shock. In particular,growing concerns about air pollution make some ideas pursuedin the 1970s unattractive, such as making petroleum&quot;synfuels&quot; from coal or oil-containing shale,environmentalists said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'm sure a lot of crazy ideas are going to come out ofthe woodwork now&quot; to cut dependence on foreign oil, saidJames MacKenzie, an energy expert at the World ResourcesInstitute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. &quot;Making synfuelsfrom oil shale, for example, would double the amount ofcarbon dioxide produced per mile&quot; of automobile travel,possibly worsening the greenhouse effect that scientists fearis causing global warming.   Conservation is the fastest, cheapest way to lower U.S.dependence on foreign oil, say energy experts. But U.S.prices for gasoline -- even after recent rises from the Iraqiinvasion of Kuwait -- probably remain too low to motivatemuch conserving, they add. By comparison, European consumerstypically pay two to three times as much for gasoline as U.S.consumers do, and, on average, use two to three times lessgasoline per capita than Americans do.   &quot;Much of our national security problem right now is drivenby artificially low fuel prices,&quot; said Mr. MacKenzie. &quot;Inconstant dollars, they've never been lower&quot; than they werebefore the Iraqi invasion. Meanwhile, the average fuelefficiency of new automobiles sold in the U.S. has fallen 4%in the past two years, he added.   However, major cuts in imported petroleum probably can'tbe achieved simply by making U.S. cars more fuel efficient,energy researchers said. They noted that growth in vehiclemiles traveled in the U.S. has largely overwhelmed increasedautomobile fuel efficiency achieved since the 1970s oilcrisis.   In 1988, there were 51 million more cars in the U.S. beingdriven 450 billion more miles than in 1970, according toWorldwatch Institute, which studies environmental issues inWashington, D.C. Contributors to the trend include expandingsuburbs, more two- and three-car families and little economicincentive to conserve fuel.   Thus, energy experts say alternative fuels will be neededto do much about imported oil. One option is ethanol, derivedfrom corn, which now comprises about 1% of U.S. automobilefuel in the form of gasohol. But using grain for ethanol&quot;hasn't been economically viable without governmentsubsidies,&quot; said Christopher Flaven, a Worldwatch Instituteenergy expert. Moreover, the U.S. currently has little unusedethanol-making capacity to tap, said Mark DeLuchi, an energyand environmental researcher at the University of Californiaat Davis. But making ethanol from non-corn raw materials --various &quot;woody&quot; plants -- might replace significant amountsof oil in the future, he added.   Another kind of alcohol, methanol, also can be used forfuel. But U.S. supplies of it are mainly imported and arederived from natural gas, whose prices are tied to oilmarkets. Methanol can be made from coal, noted Mr. DeLuchi,but the process is expensive and produces more air pollutionthan the processes for making other alternative fuels.   Perhaps the best near-term alternative fuel, said Mr.Flavin, is natural gas. &quot;It would require a substantialinvestment, but the technology is available to do it,&quot; headded. Hundreds of thousands of natural-gas vehicles alreadyare on the road in Europe. Last month, General Motors Corp.announced plans to produce 1,000 natural-gas powered trucksas part of a joint project with a group of utilities and theTexas General Land Office.   In the longer term, electric cars and hydrogen-fueledautomobiles could drastically cut oil use -- and greatlylessen air pollution, said energy researchers. Practicalelectric cars priced in the $20,000 range should be availablewithin five years or so, said Michael Vail, a spokesman forAerovironment Inc., a Monrovia, Calif., concern that designeda prototype electric car unveiled this spring by GeneralMotors. &quot;The technology is there, but it will take time tomake it affordable,&quot; he added. Still, Los Angeles is planningto have 10,000 electric vehicles in operation by 1995.   Practical hydrogen-fueled cars are generally considered tobe at least a decade away. But such vehicles could employhydrogen derived from water in reactions driven by solarpower, making them perhaps the least-polluting alternative.West Germany is the world leader in developing the technologyand has developed a prototype system for using it that isexpected to begin operating this fall, said Peter Hoffmann,editor of The Hydrogen Letter, a Hyattsville, Md., newsletterabout hydrogen-based technology. Moreover, West Germany andthe Soviet Union recently signed an agreement to jointlystudy using liquid hydrogen to power airplanes, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
