It started with murder and got worse. There were shortbudgets, police departments were understaffed,'' said George Green,46, who retired from the department as a captain in 1985.   In the racial violence of 1989, however, the Miami and Metro Dadepolice have a plan, thanks to Green.   ``I would say Miami is one of the few towns that has citizens whoare disturbance-trained,'' said Miami police spokesman Sgt. DavidRivero. ``They know what to do. That's an unfortunate thing to sayabout this town, but it's a fact.''   In 1980, when riots that killed 18 people and injured hundredshit the Liberty City neighborhood, the Miami police force had only670 officers and there was no master plan.   People traveling through the riot area were dragged from theircars and killed, some even mutilated. Police officers were trappedalone, barriers weren't set up properly.   ``It was a whole bunch of police officers trying to do the job,but not as a cohesive group,'' said Green.   ``If things could go wrong, they probably did,'' he said. ``Butthose lessons were well-learned.''   Today, police move in coordinated ``field force'' units, groupsof eight or more cars with four men in each. Squad leaders arenamed. Each officer has certain duties: some watch the cars, otherscarry the tear gas, others drive.   Whenever one car in the field force moves, all of the cars move.Quick action is taken to set up perimeters, limiting movement ofpeople into and out of a trouble zone.   Rivero says the force is trained for about 10 hours every sixmonths. ``We go out and pretend that we're out there fighting adisturbance, have policeman posing as rioters.''   Green suggested after the 1980 riots that a new approach wasneeded and was told: ``You are elected. You are now known as theurban crisis officer.''   It turned out to be a prudent move.   ``The biggest thing that became apparent to me was that policeofficers on a daily basis are trained to deal with the public in apositive manner,'' he said. ``But in a civil disorder it is thepolice against the citizens.   ``It's difficult to go from service-oriented to a military-typeapproach,'' he said.   He read military literature and considered the tools available.The field force system he developed for Miami became a popular onein law enforcement.   Dade County adopted the system. Tampa adopted elements of it.Officials from Chicago, Los Angeles and New Orleans and England havestuded the approach.</TEXT></DOC>
