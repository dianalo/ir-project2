Within four months, all tampon makers will have to use uniformterms with specified absorbency ranges, allowing women to comparebrands and choose lower-absorbency products, the Food and DrugAdministration said.   The FDA's announcement of the final regulation Thursday cappednearly a decade of haggling with industry and consumer groups andcomplied with a court order that set an Oct. 30 deadline forissuing a rule.   The labeling will require manufacturers to use the terms``junior,'' ``regular,'' ``super'' and ``super plus'' to describethe absorbency of their products.   Each term denotes a specified range of absorbency, andmanufacturers will be required to include an explanation of theranges and how women can use the information. They also will berequired to advise on labels that women can reduce risk of toxicshock by alternating sanitary napkins with tampons.   The risk of toxic shock syndrome, a rare but sometimes fatalcondition, increases with higher tampon absorbency.   ``Women who choose to use tampons instead of sanitary napkins,which have no known risk of toxic shock, should use the lowestabsorbency product that is effective for them,'' said FDACommissioner Frank Young.   Public health officials became aware of toxic shock syndrome inthe early part of the decade.   In 1982, the agency required that tampon labeling include awarning about the association between tampon use and toxic shockand advised women to use the lowest absorbency to control menstrualflow.   The labeling also had to list the symptoms of toxic shock:sudden fever of 102 or more, vomiting, diarrhea, fainting ornear-fainting when standing up, dizziness and a sunburn-like rash.   The FDA tried unsuccessfully for several years to get tamponmakers to agree on a uniform labeling system. In September 1988,the agency proposed a labeling regulation that would use a seriesof letters to designate absorbency.   The FDA revised the proposal in June to require use of new termsto indicate absorbency, though manufacturers could still use theirold terms as well. Consumers and manufacturers argued forstandardizing the terms.   The Public Citizen Health Research Group went to court to forcethe FDA to issue a final regulation, and the District Court for theDistrict of Columbia gave the agency until Oct. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
