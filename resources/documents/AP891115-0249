The newspaper reported today that PG Publishing Co. received the$2 million Tuesday from National Surety Corp., a subsidiary ofFiremen's Fund Insurance Cos. National Surety agreed to pay theamount in a settlement approved Tuesday.   PG Publishing had sued National Surety in May after the companyrefused to pay the libel claim under the newspaper'sexcess-liability policy. National Surety argued that state lawprohibits an insurer from paying punitive damages, which areintended to punish and to serve as a deterrent.   Richard DiSalle, a former judge, had sued the newspaper over a1979 article about a disputed will he handled as a lawyer. The juryawarded DiSalle $200,000 in actual damages and $2 million inpunitive damages. The award came to $2.77 million with the additionof $561,000 in interest.   The newspaper paid DiSalle in July after its primary insurer,Mutual Insurance Co. Ltd. of Bermuda, agreed to pay the $1 millionlimit of its coverage. Half that amount went to DiSalle and therest covered attorneys' fees.   Even with insurance covering the bulk of the libel award, thenewspaper will suffer economically, Block said.   A hiring freeze and other cost-saving measures implemented inresponse to the award will remain in effect until at least the endof the year, Business Manager Raymond Burnett said.   ``We will look at 1990 as a year when we get back to fullstaffing,'' Burnett said.   The Post-Gazette said the judgment was the largest paid by anewspaper and the second-largest libel judgment upheld by U.S.courts. The largest was a $3 million award last year against CBS.   The U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the DiSalle libel awardlast June.   National Surety attorney Robert Luddy said the settlement wasnot an admission that the company's position on punitive damageswas incorrect.   ``Some of these cases are better settled than litigated. Thishappened to be one of them,'' he said. ``Our position hasn'tchanged.''</TEXT></DOC>
