Consumers are buying domestic cars at a rate of 7.5 million a year, way ahead of the 6.8 million to 7 million analysts expected. Already, auto makers have sold 1.4 million U.S.-made cars, up 19% from a year earlier, when sales were unusually weak. &quot;I'm not a Pollyanna, but it looks like a very good year,&quot; says Bennett Bidwell, marketing czar at Chrysler Corp. His company recently boosted its 1988 industry sales projection by one million, to about 15 million cars and trucks, including imports.    Fueling the market are sales incentives, with the latest round of rebates from the Big Three particularly broad. Scared away by the Oct. 19 stock-market crash, buyers are returning to the market. Worries about the economy have &quot;kind of gone to bed,&quot; says Paul Curtis of Best Chevrolet, Hingham, Mass. Car inventories are down to between a 63-day and 67-day supply, compared with as high as a 100-day supply at year end.    The auto market could still &quot;take a drop,&quot; says Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities, &quot;but not a steep drop.&quot;    MOVIE THEATERS keep sprouting screens to woo viewers.    The number of moviegoers isn't growing, but movie theaters are as they scramble for a bigger piece of the pie. The preferred theater size today: at least 12 screens, says Sumner Redstone, president of National Amusements Inc., Dedham, Mass. &quot;The total industry may not grow, but people building the right theaters in the right locations should have growth for themselves,&quot; he says.    Cineplex Odeon Corp. claims the first 18-screen theater, opened last year in Universal City, Calif. More are coming. National Amusements hopes to turn its Commack, N.Y., theater into an 18-screener, while United Artists Communications Inc. talks of expanding its 13-screen theater in Patchogue, N.Y. Where will it end? Theater owners say the answer depends on the supply of motion pictures. The demand for more product may mean a longer life for many movies, says Allen Pinsker of United Artists. &quot;There are pictures that can play for four, five, six months,&quot; he says.    NEW TELLER MACHINES do more, work faster and break less.    In New York, Citicorp is installing 950 automated teller machines that use touch screens instead of buttons, respond in three languages and are 25% faster. Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, says its new ATMs are more reliable, easier to fix and can perform a typical cash withdrawal in half the time of older models. Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles, plans to install automated tellers that dispense coins and small bills &quot;so you can cash a check to the penny,&quot; says Christopher Farrell, a vice president.    Banks and thrifts are mum on the cost of the new generation of teller machines. But they expect the ATMs to cut down on teller costs and provide increased marketing opportunities. &quot;They'll be able to perform almost any service,&quot; says Robert Trujillo of Glenfed Inc., Glendale, Calif. Yet to come: ATMs that print interim bank statements, do some small business accounting and compare loan schedules.    Some shun the new machines. Empire of America, a Buffalo, N.Y., thrift, says existing machines dispense cash and &quot;that's all customers want.&quot;    CLASSIC DRINKS of the '40s and '50s are making a comeback, says Beverage Media. The martini ranked second in the publication's recent survey of what Americans are drinking. The Seven andamp; 7 came in eighth while the Manhattan was 14th.    A CATALOG OF CRAFTS, published by the University of Missouri to bolster the state's struggling farm economy, generated average sales of $1,120 per artisan, with some 66% receiving orders. The result: a second edition.    EASTER EGGS TO GO: People who don't have time to dye their own can now buy hard-boiled and pre-colored Rainbow Eggs. The maker, Pilgrim's Pride Corp., says a non-toxic coating keeps the eggs from going bad for 90 days, even when unrefrigerated. The cost: $3.59 for a carton of 18.    COMMERCIAL REMODELING stays strong while new construction sags.    With annual outlays $28 billion larger than the $64 billion being spent on new commercial construction, commercial remodeling &quot;is unquestionably the largest construction market in America,&quot; says David Sauer, publisher of Commercial Renovation. Driving the growth is the economic health of the Northeast and Midwest, where the building stock is older, says Kermit Baker, an economist with Cahners Publishing Co. &quot;It's the most cost-effective way to update facilities,&quot; he says.    In recent years, the boom in new construction &quot;distracted&quot; people from the size of the commercial renovation market, says Richard Korman of ENR, a weekly construction publication. He reports &quot;no slacking of interest&quot; despite unfavorable tax-law changes. He cites the recent announcement of a $185 million renovation of the former John Wanamaker store in Philadelphia into a mixed-use retail and office building.    When economic activity swings back to the Sun Belt, commercial renovation may again take a back seat to new construction, Mr. Baker says.    BRIEFS: The Washington, D.C., restaurant Twenty One Federal lists &quot;grilled sushi&quot; on its menu. . . . To raise money, Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School, New York, will auction two parts for extras in the cast of a Woody Allen movie. </TEXT></DOC>
