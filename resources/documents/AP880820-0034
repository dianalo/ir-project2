HATTON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of people rallied Saturday inBurma's capital to demand a return to multi-party democracy, oneday after the country got its first civilian leader in 26 years.   State-run Radio Rangoon said 112 people were killed Aug. 8-12 inthe capital, Rangoon, in rioting that led to the ouster ofhard-line leader Sein Lwin. Earlier govenment figures put the deathtoll at about 95.   An Asian diplomat in Rangoon estimated 4,000 people ralliedpeacefully in front of Rangoon General Hospital, which became agathering place for protesters after troops reportedly fired ondoctors and nurses there Aug. 2.   It has not been possible to get reliable details on the incident.   But the government Saturday denied some demonstrators' chargesthat medical personnel were killed. Radio Rangoon quoted theMinistry of Health as saying three female nurses and one male nursetrainee were wounded. Of the female nurses, only two requiredtreatment, it said.   A Western diplomat who arrived in Bangkok from Rangoon saidsecurity forces still were patrolling the Burmese capital onSaturday, ``but they are relaxed. The situation is much less(tense) than a few days ago.''   Violence flared in Burma after leader Ne Win resigned last monthand hardliner Sein Lwin, widely hated for his brutal supression ofdissent, succeeded him.   Tens of thousands of student-led protesters battled securityforces across Burma, demanding Sein Lwin's resignation, democraticrights and an easing of economic hardships in a nation where rigidsocialism and isolationism have spelled economic ruin.   Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power. The protestscontinued but focused on a demand for an end to one-party rule.   On Friday, the nation's attorney general, Maung Maung, succeededSein Lwin as state president and chairman of the Burma SocialistProgram Party. Maung Maung became the first civilian leader sinceNe Win led a 1962 military coup and replaced democracy with amilitary-dominated, one-party system.   One of Maung Maung's first acts Friday was to address theparty's Central Committee. He urged reconciliation, noted thecomplaints of workers and students, cautioned against anger andvengeance in seeking out those behind the violence, and said everyattempt must be made to prevent it from recurring.   The Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidit was important that Maung Maung's speech ``did not rule out amulti-party system.''   The diplomat described Maung Maung as ``kind of a compromisecandidate'' who ``was not in the queue to be leader'' but who hasshown concern over the students' demands and is a civilian.   The Asian diplomat, reached by telephone in Rangoon, saidBurmese had a mixed reaction to Maung Maung's speech.   ``There is one group of people who say they will wait and seewhat he can do to meet the people's desires and demands,'' he said.``The other group of people say they aren't satisfied with thespeech and that they don't expect the ... ruling circle to keepwhatever promise it makes.   ``It is too early to tell which group is the majority,'' thediplomat said.   Burma's Parliament moved Friday to defuse the situation byforming a committee to determine ``the wishes of the people.''   ``People are waiting for the committee. It has to report (toParliament) by the end of September and then we will see where thereal power lies,'' said the diplomat.   Peaceful pro-democracy rallies were held almost daily last week.Observers say Maung Maung's real test will come Monday, whenstudents have called for a nationwide strike to demand theone-party system be dismantled.   Radio Rangoon, quoting the Ministry of Health, said 112 peoplewere killed and 267 wounded in the riots in Rangoon.   Previous broadcasts had said about 95 people were killed and 240wounded in the Aug. 8-12 nationwide rioting, during which securityforces repeatedly fired to disperse crowds.</TEXT></DOC>
