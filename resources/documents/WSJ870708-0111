Paul Freedenberg, assistant secretary of commerce for trade administration, said the actions are intended to give the Japanese and Norwegian firms a chance to &quot;reestablish their bona fides&quot; as traders of sensitive technology. He said the blanket authority would be restored once the two companies demonstrate they have adopted internal controls that would prevent them from shipping militarily sensitive goods to the Soviet bloc.    The Commerce Department action is the first actual disciplinary action imposed on the two companies for their part in the illegal shipments of submarine-quietening technology to the Soviet Union. But the Pentagon has put off a decision on whether to allow Toshiba to bid to supply U.S. laptop computers to the Air Force. And both firms face possible congressional sanctions as well.    Mr. Freedenberg said the Reagan administration will work hard to minimize such sanctions if the companies and their governments cooperate with U.S. efforts to strengthen export controls.    Before the department's action, the companies were able to ship a large variety of products under single permits, called distribution licenses. Without such bulk license rights, they will have to obtain individual licenses for every product of strategic value that they want to import from the U.S. That means additional paperwork that could hamper their competitiveness. Toshiba, which yearly imports hundreds of millions of dollars worth of high-technology products from the U.S., could be especially hurt.    Both countries appear ready to cooperate with U.S. demands that they strengthen their internal controls to prevent more shipments of sensitive technology to the Soviet bloc. Theodore Wu, deputy assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement, said Norway has been &quot;awakened&quot; by the export scandal and is &quot;strengthening its national export laws.&quot;    In Tokyo, Hajime Tamura, the minister of international trade and industry, yesterday called in officials from 140 industry associations to remind their members to observe export-control guidelines.    Mr. Freedenberg said both Toshiba and Kongsberg have agreed to let the Commerce Department review their internal procedures for guarding against diversions of sensitive products. During the audits, the U.S. will make some &quot;technical suggestions,&quot; he said.    At the same time, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has accepted a U.S. offer of technical assistance in improving its own export-screening system, Mr. Freedenberg said. </TEXT></DOC>
