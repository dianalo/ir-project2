The price leaps followed Tuesday's announcement by thecenter-left government of President Alan Garcia that it woulddevalue the nation's currency by half and impose a host of otherbelt-tightening measures. The program, intended to pull the nationout of a severe recession, was the fourth emergency package adoptedthis year.   Opposition politicians said Wednesday the new package will not beeffective in ending the severe food shortages and labor strikesstemming from the shrinking economy.   Alfonso Barrantes, the former Marxist mayor of Lima and one ofthe nation's most popular leaders, told foreign journalists, ``Thiswill be a hard blow to the poor and the middle class sectors of thecountry.''   Independent analyst Alejandro Toledo said the center-leftgovernment of Alan Garcia ``must now pay the bill'' after financingtwo years of economic growth with government subsidies.   After taking office in July 1985, President Alan Garcia limitedpayments on the nation's foreign debt and used funds Peru owed tointernational banks to finance his economic recovery program.   The economy grew by 8.5 percent in 1986 and 7 percent in 1987.But Peru has exhausted its hard currency reserves, and thegovernment said the economy will shrink by at least 6 percent thisyear.   A similar austerity package announced in September _ including an86 percent currency devaluation _ failed to slow inflation butprompted widespread street protests and sporadic looting.   For the past month, Peruvians have waited for hours in linesseveral blocks long to buy daily rations of bread, sugar, rice andother staples.   Consumer prices rose 932.5 percent since January, and the 1988annual inflation rate is expected to pass 1,200 percent. Theprevious highest annual inflation rate was 158 percent in 1985.   Finance Minister Abel Salinas, who announced the latest program,said the currency devaluation of 50 percent, which will drop thevalue of the inti from 250 to 500 intis to the dollar, will restrictimports and boost exports.   The price increases pushed milk from 96 intis a pint to 250, ricefrom 60 intis a kilogram (2.2 pounds) to 120, and bread from 3.80intis a roll to 10. A gallon of gasoline rose to 600 intis, or $1.20.   The austerity measures include a wage increase of about 50percent for most government workers. The purpose of the increase isto help workers cope with increased prices.   Salinas said the government will eliminate subsidies for basicfood products in stages over the next six months because it lacksthe money to finance them.</TEXT></DOC>
