Inside the cabin, there are many survivors.A fire begins. If the passengers are to stay alive, they must get out ofthe aircraft as soon as they can. Seconds mean the difference between lifeand death. This is the scenario on which a crashworthiness standard isbased. Many other FAA rules attempt to prevent a crash from ever happening.A crashworthiness rule assumes that a survivable crash has happened andthen asks what can be done to maximize people's chances of getting outalive.This proposed rule on exit row seating concerns a crashworthiness standard.Exit doors must be opened quickly and properly if an emergency evacuationis to succeed. Often, crewmembers are not in a position to lead this partof the evacuation. Passengers sitting near the doors must perform the functionson which their lives, and the lives of their fellow passengers, depend.What are some of these functions? First, a passenger must be able to locatethe door and quickly follow the instructions for using it. Door operationsand instructions differ from airplane to airplane. A delay in figuringout how to operate the door can cost precious seconds; operating it improperlycan injure or result in the deaths of passengers. Second, a passenger mustbe able physically to open the door. Doors are often heavy and clumsy tomanipulate, and not every passenger can open them quickly.Third, a person must be able to determine when to open the door. This involvesbeing able to respond to shouted or hand-signalled instructions from flightattendants, as well as being able to tell when opening an exit would betoo dangerous (e.g., because of fire on the adjacent wing). Fourth, a personmust be able to go quickly through the open exit, so as not to cause atraffic jam at the door, and perhaps assist other passengers to leave thedanger zone around the aircraft. Fifth, a passenger must devote full attentionto his or her emergency task. A passenger who must care for small children,for example, may be unable to do so.The proposed rule says simply that airlines should seat in exit rows onlypersons who appear able to perform these and other relevant functions inan emergency evacuation. Persons who cannot perform all the functions maysit in any other seat. Airlines also would have to take new steps to informpassengers sitting in exit rows about what they would have to do in anemergency evacuation. By following the proposed requirements, airlineswould minimize the likelihood of passenger-caused evacuation delays thatcould cost lives.The rule would result in some persons being seated in seats other thanthose in exit rows, based on the application of neutral, functional criteria.For example, young children, persons who were too large or too small, personswith some disabilities, and elderly persons who are physically frail wouldbe seated in a location other than an exit row.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (``the Act'') (Pub. L. 99-435, October2, 1986) prohibits discrimination in air transportation on the basis ofhandicap. The Act also requires that measures taken to eliminate such discriminationtake into account the safety of all passengers. Specifically, it provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">(c) (1) No air carrier may discriminate against any otherwise qualifiedhandicapped individual, by reason of such handicap, in the provision ofair transportation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection the term``handicapped individual'' means any individual who has a physical or mentalimpairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sec. 3. Within one hundred and twenty days after the date of enactmentof this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall promulgate regulationsto ensure non-discriminatory treatment of qualified handicapped individualsconsistent with the safe carriage of all passengers on air carriers.</ITAG>In order to formulate regulatory proposals implementing the Act, the Secretaryof Transportation formed an advisory committee consisting of representativesfrom groups of persons with disabilities, the Government, and the air transportationindustry (52 FR 19881; May 28, 1987). The Committee began meeting on June3, 1987, under the guidance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Serviceand was scheduled to present its recommendations to the Secretary in December1987.The Committee was unable to reach a consensus regarding a recommendationon exit row seating, which had been an issue of some concern to the Committee.Consequently, the Department had the responsibility of proposing for itsown provision on this subject, which it did in a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) published June 22, 1988 (53 FR 23574). Concerning exit row seating,that NPRM proposed that carriers be prohibited from excluding persons fromany seat on the basis of handicap, except in order to comply with an FAAsafety rule. This FAA NPRM, amending 14 CFR Parts 121 and 135, proposesrestrictions on exit row seating on the basis of neutral, nondiscriminatorycriteria applicable to all passengers. The statutory authority for Part121 is 49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1355, 1356, 1357, 1401, 1421-1430, 1472, 1485,and 1502; 49 U.S.C. 106(g) (Revised Pub. L. 97-449, January 12, 1983).The statutory authority for Part 135 is 49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1355(a), 1421-1431,and 1502; 49 U.S.C. 106(g) (Revised Pub. L. 97-449, January 12, 1983).<ITAG tagnum="84">Previous FAA Rulemaking Activity</ITAG>Exit row seating has been the subject of FAA rulemaking in the past. InNotice 74-25 (July 2, 1974; 39 FR 24667), the FAA proposed a regulation,andSection;121.584, which would have provided that a handicapped person capableof traveling alone (e.g., a blind or a deaf person) could not be deniedtransportation so long as the person could be seated in any seat otherthan:<ITAG tagnum="21">The two seats nearest an exit, and any seat in a row immediately adjacentto an exit with the exception of the farthest seat from the exit in thatrow.</ITAG>In other words, the two seats nearest an exit would have been unavailableto all handicapped persons in all cases, and other seats in an exit rowwould have been unavailable as well, depending on the length of the row,with the exception of the seat farthest from the exit.That proposal was not adopted. The FAA chose instead to adopt in Amendment121-133 a rule allowing each certificate holder to develop procedures appropriateto its own operations and aircraft (42 FR 18392; April 7, 1977). The FAA,however, issued an advisory circular (AC 120-31; March 25, 1977, the samedate as Amendment 121-133) to assist certificate holders in developingtheir own procedures, which provided guidance on seating.Paragraph 9 of the advisory circular states:<ITAG tagnum="21">9. <T3>SEATING HANDICAPPED PASSENGERS. </T3>FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institutehas conducted research to determine where handicapped passengers shouldbe seated in an aircraft operated under Parts 121 and 135 so that, in theevent of an emergency evacuation, they can leave the aircraft, either unassistedor assisted, by the safest and most expedient route while not slowing theevacuation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Those nonambulatory handicapped passengers should be seated inaisle seats where they would be near the end of lines of passengers beingevacuated through floor-level, nonoverwing exits. Tests revealed that dueto the narrow aisle width, an accompanying attendant trying to lift thehandicapped person would temporarily block the aisle and hinder other passengersattempting to evacuate. Once the mainstream of evacuating passengers haspassed, the attendant and the handicapped passenger can normally catchup to the flow since there is a bunching at the exit. Two nonambulatorypassengers with attendants should not be seated directly across the aislefrom each other because their attendants would interfere with each otherwhile attempting to remove the nonambulatory passengers from their seats.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. To determine the amount of assistance nonambulatory passengerswill require to evacuate the aircraft, an agent should first ask the passengerswhat their capabilities are. If there is some question as to whether anindividual is ambulatory or nonambulatory, the agent may ask him to performa simple test such as transferring from a wheelchair, unaided, to anotherseat. Additionally, the passenger may furnish evidence of his capability,such as a driver's license or a statement signed by a qualified professionalperson (e.g. a physician or physical therapist).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Ambulatory handicapped passengers should be seated in areas inwhich evacuation would normally occur through a floor-level, nonoverwingexit.</ITAG>The FAA's intent, in issuing this rule and advisory circular, was thatcarriers would adopt reasonable seating policies consistent with the FAA'sadvice and consequently, to a significant extent, consistent with othercarriers' policies.The FAA's experience, including a review of a large number of carrier policiescarried out in connection with the work of the advisory committee, suggeststhat FAA's intent has not been realized fully. Some carriers have not establishedseating policies fully consistent with the advisory circular. Carrier policiesappear to be inconsistent with one another in a number of cases. Further,information available to the Committee shows that certificate holder personnel,in excluding persons from those seats, may have done so in the mistakennotion that an existing FAA regulation required it or may have alludedto a non-existent regulation to ``settle the argument.'' This, in turn,has led to increased pressure to remove restrictions on seating handicappedpersons in exit rows. Under these circumstances, the FAA has determinedthat it is necessary to consider regulatory requirements concerning exitrow seating.The need to review and reconsider the FAA position is heightened by theprovision of the Air Carrier Access Act NPRM, referred to above. Concerningseat assignments, proposed andSection;382.31 states:<ITAG tagnum="21">Carriers shall not exclude any person from a seat in an exit row orother location or require that a person sit in a particular seat, on thebasis of handicap, except in order to comply with the requirements of anFAA safety regulation.</ITAG>This formulation contemplates consideration of an FAA proposal on thissubject. Unless the FAA promulgates a safety regulation on exit row seating,the proposed provision of the rule implementing the Air Carrier AccessAct would abolish all air carrier seating policies in effect, and it wouldprohibit the institution of new ones, regardless of valid safety considerations.For all the foregoing reasons, the FAA has determined to reexamine theissue of exit row seating.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings of Civil Aeromedical Institute Studies</ITAG>The FAA reviewed in detail the results of research conducted by the FAA'sCivil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) to assess the effects of handicappedpassengers aboard an aircraft during an emergency evacuation. CAMI's projectwas undertaken in response to the Civil Aeronautics Board's (CAB) requestfor clear safety standards in this area. Basically, the position of theCAB in 1972 was similar to that of the FAA today. It recognized that handicappedpersons were encountering inconsistent practices and policies in the provisionof air carriage. The CAB recommended that appropriate actions be taken,looking towards the issuance of safety regulations on this pressing problem.``Flight Standards Technical Division Report on Air Transportation of HandicappedPersons,'' June 1973, p. 3.As discussed further herein, the FAA elected not to regulate directly,in regard to exit row seating or other issues relating to the carriageof handicapped persons. Instead, it issued andSection;121.586 of the FederalAviation Regulations (FAR), ``Authority to refuse transportation,'' whichallows air carriers to establish their own procedures for persons who mayneed assistance in an emergency evacuation.In light of the FAA's experience under the current regulation, FAA findsthat the CAMI research supports restrictions on exit row seating. A CAMIreport on the subject states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The average ambulatory handicapped passenger appears to possess adequatemobility for escape. He could be seated anywhere in the cabin except inan exit row or a primary overwing exit route * * * ``Emergency Escape ofHandicapped Air Travelers,'' Report FAA-AM 77-11, July 1977, p. 36.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">[A copy of this report has been entered in the Regulatory Docket].This report was prepared for possible publication in scientific journalsand, therefore, included certain observations and tests conducted by theresearchers that were not contained in the 1973 report by the FAA's FlightStandards Service, ``Air Transportation of Handicapped Persons,'' ProjectReport No. 73-740-120A. Although both reports are based on the tests conductedin 1973, only the 1973 report, which contains no direct conclusions onexit row seating, was available at the time Amendment 121-133 was adopted.The research does make a number of findings relevant to the seating ofpersons with disabilities. The agency simply did not have available thefull, considered opinions of the researchers at the time Amendment 121-133was adopted. Among the research findings are the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">In proceeding to exit doors from given seats, handicapped personsexceeded the exit time of unimpaired people by 22 to 1,189 percent.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id.,</T3> Tables 1 and 2, at 6, 7.<ITAG tagnum="21">Persons with disabilities increased the exit time through floor-levelexits in all cases, ranging from 3.9 seconds to 49.8 seconds.

Researchers found the increase to be most significantin the totally handicapped category, less significant in the lower limband partial immobility category, and least significant in the upper limband sensory handicap category. Increases occurred, however, in all categories.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id.,</T3> at 29.<ITAG tagnum="21">Although the time needed to evacuate anthropomorphic dummies was somewhathigher than would have been the case for most human beings, the times requiredby actual persons with disabilities also were greater than those of theable persons.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id.,</T3> at 29.In regard to evacuation times, andSection; 121.291(a) of the FAR requiresall certificate holders to demonstrate that each type and model of airplanewith a seating capacity of more than 44 passengers can be evacuated in90 seconds or less. The evacuations must be conducted in accordance withAppendix D to Part 121 of the FAR, which calls for the tests to be conductedwith a representative passenger load of persons in normal health. At least30 percent must be females; at least 5 percent must be over 60 years ofage with a proportionate number of females; at least 5 percent but notmore than 10 percent must be children under 12 years of age, prorated throughthat age group. Three life-size dolls, not included as part of the normalpassenger load, must be carried by passengers to simulate live infants2 years old or younger. Crewmembers, mechanics, and training personnel,who maintain or operate the airplane in the normal course of their duties,may not be used as passengers. Other conditions also must be representative,such as the seating density and arrangements, carry-on baggage, etc., butonly 50 percent of the emergency exits can be made available.Rapid evacuation is necessary, of course, due to the hazards of fire, smoke,explosion, and flooding in the event of an inadvertent water landing. Itis vital, therefore, to minimize delays in every possible way. In the CAMIstudy, the researchers concluded that seating location could be used tominimize the delays. Clearly, it would be neither desirable nor feasibleto limit passenger loads to those ``in normal health,'' as in the emergencyevacuation demonstrations required for transport category airplane certification.On the other hand, persons with handicaps should not be exposed to injuriesthat can be avoided nor should they impede the evacuation of other passengers.Instead, they should be seated where these dangers are minimized.In the CAMI studies, information for the study of seat location was drawnfrom a variety of tests. These included: (1) An evaluation of individualswith handicaps, where individuals moved from one of three designated seatlocations to a specific exit; (2) evaluation of handicapped passengerswho required assistance to move to an exit; (3) evaluation of the evacuationof totally incapacitated passengers; (4) evaluation of the evacuation ofgrouped handicapped passengers; (5) evaluation of mixed group evacuations;(6) evaluation of the effect of exit configuration on evacuation; and (7)a separate evaluation of the evacuation of a paraplegic subject. <T3>Id.,</T3> at 4 through 28.Subjects were recruited from a variety of sources. Nonhandicapped subjectswere FAA employees or were hired through the University of Oklahoma Officeof Research Administration. Most handicapped subjects were recruited fromparticipating organizations, such as the Oklahoma Foundation for the Disabled,the Oklahoma League for the Blind, the United Cerebral Palsy RehabilitationWorkshop of Greater Oklahoma City, and The Carver School. <T3>Id.,</T3> at 2.One hundred sixty-two subjects, ranging in age from 15 to 84 years, participated.Eight had disabilities resulting from cerebral palsy; four from arthritis;three from polio; four from multiple sclerosis; two from muscular dystrophy;and five from birth defects. Eighteen were paraplegics; 2 were quadriplegics;and 15 were hemiplegics. Twelve were classified as elderly, either on thebasis of age alone or on their physical condition. Their ages ranged from55 to 84. Fifteen were blind; one was classified as legally blind; andeight were partially sighted. In addition, 22 normally-sighted personsperformed as simulated blind passengers. Two were in casts and seven hadfractures, amputations, or breaks that had mended poorly and affected theirmobility. Seventeen had mental deficiencies and 7 had mental illnesses(depression or schizophrenia). Two had no handicap and were capable ofspeed running. Four were obese, and four were deaf. <T3>Id.,</T3> Appendix B.Especially relevant to this proposed rulemaking are the results of theCAMI tests on group evacuations. The research team found that seating ofhandicapped passengers in a normal passenger population during normal flightconditions results in, at most, an occasional minor inconvenience to otherpassengers. They found, however, that under circumstances where the passengercabin must be speedily evacuated, placement of the handicapped passengersbecomes important.Information for the study of seat location was drawn from three test series:using an actual handicapped passenger in a passenger population of 24;using simulated handicapped passengers in a passenger population of 23;and using simulated handicapped passengers in a passenger population of50. The simulated passengers were anthropomorphic dummies, to avoid injuryto persons with actual disabilities.Five tests involving the actual handicapped person, who required an assistantto carry him from the plane, showed that better evacuation times generallyresulted when the handicapped passenger and his assistant were seated awayfrom the exit. This enabled the assistant to position the handicapped personon his back properly, without delaying passengers behind him and withoutexperiencing difficulties himself, due to crowding and shoving. <T3>Id.,</T3> at 19.In tests involving subjects simulating total incapacitation, one man assistinga fairly light dummy worked skillfully into the flow of passengers withoutdelay. Evacuation of a 200-pound dummy from a seat near the exit was moredifficult, and a delay of about 3 seconds resulted. <T3>Id.,</T3> at 19.Placing the dummies at the farthest point from the exit, the extreme endof the passenger population, allowed the cabin attendant to establish agood evacuation flow immediately. The total evacuation of 23 live passengerstook only 25.04 seconds. There was little delay in this test because mostpassengers were not detained by the action required to move the dummiesand because their assistants had ample time to position them for transportwhile the forward line of passengers was evacuating. <T3>Id.,</T3> at 23.When the simulated handicapped persons were placed in forward positions,only 6 passengers (including 2 dummies) exited in the same time (20 seconds)that 17 passengers exited when the dummies were placed at the farthestpoint from the exit. <T3>Id.,</T3> at 23.Passengers with upper limb and sensory handicaps had the least delayingeffect on passenger flow times once their seatbelts were released. <T3>Id.,</T3> at 34. The tests, however, measured only their capacity tomove from their seats to an exit under optimum conditions. To safeguardthe subjects, none were asked to use evacuation slides. None were askedto open emergency exits and to perform the other tasks addressed herein,all of which are much more demanding than the relatively simple task ofleaving a seat and moving forward to an exit without the dangers of flame,smoke, debris, and panic.It has been suggested by some persons that there may be little or no relationshipbetween a passenger's rate of movement from a seat to an emergency exitand his or her ability to open the exit and perform the other functionsstated in the proposed rule. The FAA requests commenters to provide copiesof any studies that support that thesis. The CAMI studies do not pointto that conclusion.Videotapes of the experiments, which are discussed further herein and copiesof which have been placed in the docket, show the effect of various disabilitieson movement from the seats to the doors. In many cases, it is readily apparentthat the cause of slow progress, such as the immobilized arm of a strokevictim, also would affect the person's ability to open a door.The videotapes also show that some passengers with a fairly good rate ofmovement down an aisle would have trouble, nevertheless, opening the door.A paraplegic with strong shoulders and arms, for example, could drag himselfor herself toward the exit but would not have the stability to stand andremain upright to operate the door or window mechanisms.The tests revealed that evacuation of the control group (persons with nohandicaps) consistently was faster than that of groups with handicaps.Further, the evacuation time increase in all handicapped groups, when theevacuation test involved a window exit rather than a floor-level exit.It is significant that this rather modest increase in complexity, froma floor-level to a window exit test, resulted in increased evacuation times.It is logical to conclude that additional complexity, such as finding andoperating mechanisms, would impose additional burdens on persons with handicapsand cause delays.Given the results of the tests, the researchers concluded that the averageambulatory handicapped passenger could be seated anywhere in the cabinexcept in an exit row or an overwing exit route, where he or she mightimpede the early stages of an evacuation or be injured by the rush of otherpassengers. This approach, which differs from that originally proposedin Notice 74-25 in 1974, serves as the basis for the present proposal.<T3>Id.,</T3> at 36.Further, the researchers also found that ``if nonambulatory passengersare seated in a group, the group should be seated in the cabin so thatthey, and their assistants, would be at the end of a line of evacuees soas not to interfere with the evacuation of other passengers and to avoidcrowding by other passengers during their preparation for evacuation.''<T3>Id</T3>., at 36. Clearly, this preferred seating position for nonambulatorypersons is incompatible with sitting in an exit row, which by nature isat the beginning of a line of evacuees.It should be noted that seating ``at the end of a line of evacuees'' doesnot necessarily mean being seated at the back of the airplane or beingthe last person to evacuate. The location of the emergency exits determinesthe end of the line. Between a forward exit door and a window exit, forexample, it is likely that two exit flows will develop_one toward the doorand one toward the window. The break between the two flows will tend tocome at midpoint between the two exits.While it always is possible that one of the exits will become inoperablein an emergency, thereby changing the anticipated passenger flow, the FAAstudies show that the seating proposed results in the expeditious evacuationof the greatest number of passengers.The question has arisen as to whether certificate holders should ensurethat at least one seat is occupied in each emergency exit row. The FAAdoes not believe that such a requirement is necessary. Nearby passengerswho are able to perform the necessary functions could move into an emptyrow rapidly to perform the necessary functions.It also has been suggested that the seats in all exit rows be removed orthe aisles widened. The FAA does not believe that either approach wouldremove the need for positioning persons capable of performing the necessaryfunctions near enough to the emergency exits to perform the evacuationfunctions that may be required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Research</ITAG>In addition to reviewing the CAMI documents, FAA staff took part in recurrentflight attendant training during October 1987 to observe and experiencefirst-hand an evacuation drill at a major certificate holder. The informationavailable from this training program was instructive. In the training devicesof this certificate holder alone, there were at least 11 types of doorsor emergency exits, each of which required varying degrees of strengthand agility to open and each of which operated somwhat differently fromthe others. It is reasonable to conclude that, given the differences inoperating instructions and techniques, sight also would play a major rolein successfully opening the door or exit in a timely fashion.In addition, the FAA reviewed scenes from a videotape, made at the timeof the 1973 CAMI study, which showed actual, as well as simulated, handicappedpersons, in the process of evacuating a simulated transport category airplanefuselage section. While the study's statistics provide ample evidence ofthe difference between the evacuation times of passengers with and withoutdisabilities, the film provides very graphic evidence of the difficultiesof movement associated with certain types of disabilities. These tapesare also made part of the rulemaking docket.The FAA also reviewed a study completed in October 1970, by the Officeof Aviation Medicine of the FAA, entitled, ``Survival in Emergency Escapefrom Passenger Aircraft.'' (Document No. AM 70-16). This document discusseshuman factors relating to survival in emergency escapes from passengeraircraft. Data was secured from three actual accidents, with a total of261 passengers, 105 of whom lost their life.The accidents involved a United Airlines DC-8, which crashed during a landingat Stapleton Field, Denver; a United Airlines Boeing 727, which crash-landedat Salt Lake City Municipal Airport; and a Trans World Airlines (TWA) Boeing707-331, which crashed on takeoff from Fiumicino Airport in Rome, Italy.The study, a copy of which has been entered in the Regulatory Docket, dealsin detail with the emergency evacuations; the behavior of the passengers;their seat locations, the age, sex, and other characteristics of the passengers;the causes of death or injury, and the effect of the crashes on the emergencyexits.This study concluded that:<ITAG tagnum="21">In aircraft accidents in which decelerative forces do not result inmassive cabin destruction and overwhelming trauma to passengers, survivalis determined largely by the ability of the uninjured passenger to makehis way from a seat to an exit <T3>within time limits imposed by the thermotoxic environment.</T3></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Emphasis added.) <T3>Id.</T3> at 57.That is, it is crucial that people evacuate quickly before heat, flames,toxic fumes, or an explosion kill or injure them.In addition, the FAA reviewed a ``Protection and Survival Laboratory Memorandum,''No. AAM-119-87-6, dated November 5, 1987, based on CAMI ``Accident/IncidentBio-Medical Data Reports.'' This memorandum has been placed in the rulemakingdocket. At the time of the November 5, 1987, memorandum, the CAMI CabinSafety Date Bank contained 3,382 entries. Of these, 132 pertained to problemsof persons with handicaps or with characteristics that are likely to affecttheir ability to activate an emergency exit and to take the additionalactions needed to ensure safe use of that exit in an emergency. The memorandumfocused on 50 of these entries. While information in such a document issubject to additional evaluation or change on review of the data, conductof additional testing, or receipt of additional facts, the memorandum lendssupport to the CAMI conclusions regarding problems encountered by the disabledand others during evacuation. The FAA also reviewed the 50 entries individually.All included problems affecting persons with disabilities, handicaps, theaged, children, the obese, and others having characteristics which couldaffect the evacuation process.While the memorandum included some reports of successful, rapid evacuationby persons with disabilities, the reports show rather dramatically thatcertain factors generally impede rapid evacuation_advanced age or extremeyouth; parental responsibilities for minors; physical disabilities; obesity;injury or ill health, etc. Many of the persons impeded by these factorsrequired the assistance of others to escape.It should be noted that in seven of the above cases, this assistance wasprovided by certificate holder crewmembers, persons in related occupations,or persons especially trained for emergencies such as fire, police, andmilitary personnel, while assistance by other passengers was observed inonly four of the cases. While it is conceivable that there were more instancesof such assistance, the figures are in line with data obtained by the FAAin its study of three major aircraft accidents. The FAA found that whilestill aboard, passengers usually did not attempt to help others unlessthey were members of their own family. ``Survival in Emergency Escape fromPassenger Aircraft, AM 70-16, October 1970,'' at 15 and 86.In regard to assistance to handicapped passengers, the CAMI researchersfound:<ITAG tagnum="21">Assisting handicapped passengers in an aircraft cabin is difficultbecause of space limitations generated by the seat configurations.

The study reports:<ITAG tagnum="21">He positioned himself in the aisle so that a feet first scoot waspossible. Although his movements were quick, he fell behind when trafficreally began to move and delayed those behind him about 4 s.

This isespecially true in an emergency where an exit row occupant is responsiblefor opening the exit. The data provide support for the FAA's conclusionthat rulemaking is necessary to avoid the establishment or continuationof practices that are in derogation of the safety of all passengers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Safety Under the Air Carrier Access Act</ITAG>The Air Carrier Access Act protects the civil rights of handicapped personsand clearly mandates continued concern for safety. Further, safety constitutedan important theme in the legislative history. The Senate Report focusedon this issue at several points. It states that the statute ``does notmandate any compromise of existing DOT or Federal Aviation (FAA) safetyregulations.'' Sen. Rept. 99-400, August 13, 1986, p. 4. The FAA's existingrules allowing carriers to establish their own procedures for persons whomay need assistance in an emergency evacuation (andSection; 121.586 of theFAR) does not cover specifically the role of exit row seating in air safety.Consequently, the FAA now must address the issue directly. In draftingthis proposed rule to regulate exit row seating, the FAA has remained mindfulof both the words of the Act and the expressed congressional intent regardingsafety and civil rights.The FAA notes, for example, that the Senate Report states that it was intendedthat the certificate holders will not ``impose upon handicapped travelersany regulations or restrictions unrelated to safety and unrelated to thenature and extent of any individual's handicap.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 4.In a statement made on the Senate floor, Senator Robert Dole added:<ITAG tagnum="21">Our intent * * * is that so long as the procedures of each airline[concerning the transportation of handicapped passengers] are safe as determinedby the FAA, there should be no restrictions placed upon air travel by handicappedpersons.

The legislative history shows that the Congresspassed the Air Carrier Access bill specifically to close a gap in the RehabilitationAct. During consideration of the Senate bill, S. 2703, Senator Dole statedspecifically that the purpose of the legislation is to ``overturn the recentSupreme Court decision in the case of Paralyzed Veterans of America versusthe Department of Transportation. This case, which was handed down by thehigh court in the closing days of its spring term, held that section 504of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 `is not applicable' to U.S. carriers,except for those few small regional carriers who receive direct Federalsubsidies.''

The seating restriction is narrowly defined,and this proposed regulation would not constitute a barrier to meaningfulaccess to air carrier transportation.In addition, the proposed rule is in accord with governing judicial decisions.The Supreme Court has held that nondiscrimination on the basis of handicapdoes not require the imposition of undue financial and administrative burdens,nor does it require modifications that would result in a fundamental alterationof the nature of a program. <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3>v. <T3>Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979); <T3>American Public Transit </T3>v. <T3>Lewis, </T3>665 F.2d 1272 (D.C.

The Supreme Court concluded in <T3>Alexander </T3>that ``The balance struck in <T3>Davis </T3>[<T3>Southeastern</T3>] requires that an otherwise qualified handicappedindividual must be provided with <T3>meaningful access </T3>to the benefit that the grantee offers * * *to assure meaningful access, <T3>reasonable accommodations </T3>in the grantee's program or benefitmay have to be made.'' (Emphasis supplied.) <T3>Alexander, </T3>at 301.These principles and section 3 of the Act require carriers to ensure meaningfulaccess to air transportation while considering the potential safety impactof seating policies that are necessary to transporting passengers withthe maximum degree of safety. Banning all persons with disabilities fromparticular seats, or requiring all disabled persons to sit in particularseats, would be unlawful discrimination; but the exclusion of persons withcertain disabilities from the seats covered by the rule for legitimatesafety reasons does not deprive them of ``meaningful access'' to air carriertransportation. Exit rows provide only a small fraction of the availableseating in the air carrier fleet. The FAA does not propose to bar any personsfrom seating that does not adversely affect their safety or that of otherpassengers. Furthermore, the rule specifically provides that a person witha disability cannot be denied transportation as a result of the safetyrestrictions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Evacuations_Exit Row Passenger Functions</ITAG>From a safety standpoint, a person who sits in an exit row or, in caseswhere there is no aisle, in any seat that has direct access to an exitmust be able to accomplish a number of tasks under a variety of conditionswithout assistance. These include:Locating the ExitIn order to be able to locate the exit in an emergency, the passenger inan exit row must be able to comprehend and identify that he/she is in sucha row. The primary means of such comprehension and identification is seeingthe exit, as well as its placards, and recognizing their significance.Although a person familiar with one or more aircraft seating configurationsmight be able to recognize that he/she is in an exit row by counting seatrows, that method is not reliable. Seating configurations vary from certificateholder to certificate holder and even from aircraft to aircraft in thesame fleet. Further, the ability to remember seating configurations isnot something that can be discerned by ordinary means of observation. Itwould not be practical to expect that a certificate holder assigning seatscould identify a person with that ability, or be sure that one who claimssuch ability actually has it. It has been suggested that special briefingscould be given to blind persons to inform them of their exit row occupancyand to familiarize them with the door or window mechanism. During an actualevacuation, however, there is no guarantee that the nearest exit will beoperable or should be used. The FAA's study of three major accidents (ReportAM-70-16), described previously herein, includes data on this point. Inthe Denver accident, the left window exits became unusable due to fireon the wing. Debris blocked the main, rear boarding door. Fire destroyedthe slide at the aft galley door after about 20 persons used it. Otherpassengers then had to jump_a situation with special hazards for blindand other handicapped passengers. In the Salt Lake City accident, fireon the left side of the fuselage drove persons away from the window exitsthere to the right side instead. In the Rome crash, fire spread to theleft side of the aircraft, hampering the escape of passengers from thatside. Further, the forward galley door was not used due to fire. ``Survivalin Emergency Escape from Passenger Aircraft,'' at 11, 12, 22, 31, and 33.Clearly all passengers benefit if the persons seated in an exit row candetermine quickly whether its door or window remains operable or conditionsoutside allow its use.Recognizing, Comprehending the Instructions for Use, and Operating theExit Opening Mechanism These tasks call for the ability to locate and identify the mechanism andthe range and direction of motion required to use the mechanism effectively.They require the ability to perceive and understand the normally availabledirections pertaining to use of the mechanism. Ascertaining the completedirections for opening an exit often requires observation of both the exititself, which may have on it a graphic illustration regarding the directionof motion of the mechanism required to open the exit, and a passenger informationcard and/or video tape presentation. These contain further graphic illustrationsof the complete set of actions required for use of the opening mechanism.It should be emphasized that these presentations rely on graphic displaysas well as on words. Reliable oral interpretation of the graphics for thebenefit of a blind person by another passenger depends on the ability ofthe person attempting to convey the information. There would be no practicalway to test this in advance. Similarly, relying on another passenger totranslate instructions would be impractical in the case of persons whodo not speak the same language. In addition, other passengers have no legalduty to convey such information to a handicapped, non-English speaking,or illiterate passenger, and it would not be feasible to require them todemonstrate such an ability. Further, many passenger information cards focus on main handles of theexit, on the assumption that passengers will be able to see or read furtherinstructions or find adjunct mechanisms. To illustrate, at the Flight AttendantsRecurrent Training Course, the following were noted: An overwing window exit generally will have a handle marked ``Pull'' or``Pull Down,'' but no placard or information concering the other hand gripwhich must be located and grasped at the same time as the movable handle.Both must be grasped to enable the person opening the exit window to moveit out of the way to prevent blockage of the exit. Certain operating mechanisms are not integral parts of the exit doors butmay be located adjacent to the exit door. Still others have covers, labeledwith words indicating they should be removed to allow use of the mechanismin an emergency. On power-assisted exit doors, in addition to the mechanism for openingit, there often is an arming device located near the opening handle. Ifactivated by mistake, it will prevent the door from opening. Sighted personscan differentiate this handle from the door mechanisms, which are fullylabelled. No instructions are provided to passengers in connection withthe arming devices because they are intended for crew use only. Yet, theirproximity to the opening handles presents a chance that a person, who cannotdiscern the difference between the two mechanisms, inadvertently couldrender the exit useless. Once this occurs, it is not reversible withoutthe assistance of trained mechanics.Several persons have suggested that the locations and types of mechanismsmay pose problems for persons other than those with disabilities. Theyrecommend more detailed instructions on both the passenger evacuation cardsand near the emergency exits. The FAA invites further comment on this issue.Assessing ConditionsThis requirement includes both sensory and cognitive abilities. The primarysense involved is sight. Cognitive abilities include the capacity to judgedanger. Young children, for example, may lack the ability to make the requiredjudgments. Opening an exit in an emergency may increase the danger to whichall passengers are exposed, if doing so allows an external fire or evenits smoke to enter the cabin. Danger to passengers also can be increasedif they are encouraged to use an exit which might open onto dangerous conditions,such as jagged metal, ice, water, unexpected distance to the ground orsome condition which might be avoided by using another exit. It has been suggested that a blind person could be advised orally of asighted person's assessment without derogating the safety of others. TheFAA does not agree that this offers a practical alternative to excludingblind people from exit rows. Emergencies are more likely than not to fosterconfusion. To add a requirement for one person to assess conditions andrelay that assessment to another before an emergency exit can be opened,solely to provide that other with the right to sit in an exit row, wouldbe to increase danger unnecessarily.It also has been suggested that a blind person can assess the danger presentedby external fire through the sense of touch. The argument is that a blindperson could sense an external fire by feeling the inside of the door.While that may be true in some cases, this argument is not valid in thecase of fire that is not yet near enough to the airplane or of sufficientintensity to cause the inside of the door to be warm enough to warn againstopening the door. Large, modern aircraft are extremely well-insulated.At 30,000 feet, a passenger cannot feel the intense cold (as low as -70degrees centigrade) by placing a hand on the fuselage. In addition, this assertion does not deal with the dangers presented bysmoke, jagged metal, and other hazards such as those mentioned above. Thecertificate holders train crewmembers to ``feel'' the door while lookingout the window to assess conditions, but this action is designed to causea pause for assessment of viewed conditions before reaching for the exitoperating mechanism. It is not considered an independent means of assessment.In some doors, prism windows now allow visual assessment along the fulllength of the aircraft all the way to the ground to determine whether fireor obstacles are present. Clearly, blind persons cannot make such an assessment.Automatic slides fail from time to time. When this happens, the personnearest the exit must recognize that manual deployment will be necessary,find the manual deployment handle, and operate it. If this fails, it maybe necessary to find and communicate the need for a totally different meansof escape. Sighting flashing door lights, following floor lights, or seeingthe hand signals of others may be necessary for effective escape leadership.While this leadership may fall to a passenger outside the exit row, itwill do so more rapidly if those in the exit row can quickly and accuratelyassess the state of that exit. Finally, it has been suggested that blind persons are better able to functionin the dark and actually may be more useful than sighted persons in anemergency evacuation. It is not certain, however, that in any given crashscenario darkness will be so complete as to render sight useless. Crashesinvolving fire and smoke may lead ultimately to total darkness in the cabin,but data available to the FAA at this time indicate that light cues usuallyare available. These may come from the fire itself, airport or other lighting,red emergency lights near the doors, and floor track lights. Even in densesmoke, an open door may appear shades lighter than the balance of the surroundingsand draw passengers to safety. Assessing Whether a Slide Can Be Used Safely This includes judging whether the slide has extended, whether it terminatesin a safe area, whether the physical integrity of the slide is adequatefor its use, and whether passengers are accumulating on the slide in suchnumbers as to threaten its integrity. Stowing or Securing the Exit Door The action needed to stow or secure the exit door expeditiously and safelyvaries widely. On power-assisted doors, no separate action beyond turningthe handle may be required. Removal of an exit window, however, will requiremaneuvering a 40- to 80-pound, approximately 2- x 3-foot window over theadjacent seat back into the row behind the exit or onto seats in the balanceof the exit row. This requires strength, sight to ensure that others areout of harm's way of the detached window, and speaking ability to issuethe appropriate orders or warnings to passengers in the way. In stowing doors that swing outward, such as those on some Boeing 727 models,care must be taken to avoid falling out of the airplane. A handle nearthe door is provided for just this purpose, and its purpose is obviousto a sighted person attempting to open the door. In the passenger informationcards of one major certificate holder, this handle is visible in picturesof the door, but its use is not discussed. This makes it unlikely thatit would be revealed to a blind person being apprised of the exit operatinginstructions by a sighted companion. Such communication was suggested byat least one witness appearing before the advisory committee as being alla blind person would need to function as effectively as a sighted personin regard to opening an emergency exit safely and expeditiously. A similarargument could be made with respect to passengers who cannot read the languagesin which the instructions are presented. It is the FAA's position thatsuch instruction or explanation by another person constitutes an unnecessarydelay factor and simply points to the need for placing sighted personsin exit rows. Safely Using the Exit This includes passing expeditiously through the exit and assessing, selecting,and following a safe path away from the exit. A person leading the wayout of an exit in an emergency should have the agility to exit quickly,the strength to assist other passengers, and the ability to avoid hazardssuch as water, jagged metal, unexpected heights (such as might be causedby failed or damaged slides), and rescue vehicles and associated equipment.Following Oral Directions or Hand Signals From a Crewmember During an anticipated evacuation, survival may depend on the ability ofpersons in exit rows to see, hear, and understand the instructions issuedby crewmembers. As discussed previously herein, exits may become inoperableor unavailable due to fire, structural damage, or damage to slides. Insome situations, opening an exit may exacerbate the danger by allowingflames or smoke to rush into the cabin. The potential for such danger isincreased if persons in these exit rows cannot see it or hear and understandshouted directions and warnings from crewmembers. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Options for Exit Row Seating</ITAG>In addition to the proposal in this NPRM, the FAA considered a number ofother options in regard to exit row seating.The first of these was the approach originally proposed in Notice 74-25in 1974. Basically, this would have prohibited handicapped passengers fromsitting in all exit row seats except the seat farthest from the exit. TheFAA did not select this approach for the following reasons. (1) In theevent the remaining seats in the exit row were not assigned, the sole passengerin that row could be a handicapped person; (2) similarly, if the otherpassengers became incapacitated, the sole passenger in that row could bea handicapped person; and (3) even if the other passengers were able-bodied,a handicapped person in the exit row would be more likely than an able-bodiedperson to cause some delay in establishing the evacuation flow, as demonstratedin the CAMI studies.The second approach was suggested by a representative of one of the groupsof persons with disabilities. This called for only the seat adjacent toa window exit to be reserved for only persons capable of performing thenecessary functions. Again, this approach presupposed the survival or undiminishedcapacity of the able-bodied person during an accident or emergency landing.Further, it would have allowed handicapped persons to sit in floor-levelexit rows. This approach is not viable, given the available data on evacuationflow.The FAA's objective in this proposal is to maximize the likelihood forsurvival. In order to do so, it is necessary that only persons capableof performing the necessary functions be seated in exit rows, to enhancethe ability of all passengers to evacuate safely. Persons in exit rowsmay have to work as a team. In the window exit rows, for example, the taskof removing the window hatch ordinarily would fall to the person next tothe window hatch. The window hatches weigh 45 to 80 pounds and must bemanuevered either over the back of the seat to the next row or placed onthe seat next to the window exit seat. In either case, nearby passengersmust have the capacity to recognize the need for moving out of the wayrapidly and have the capacity to do so. In addition, the whole row of passengersmust be capable of performing the necessary functions because the seatadjacent to the emergency exit may be unoccupied.The initial evacuees also may have to work as a team on the ground. Ina high wind, it may be necessary for several persons to hold down a slideand to catch passengers (especially disabled ones) and assist them awayfrom the slide. The FAA invites comments, however, on the other optionsconsidered as well as any other options the agency may not have considered.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Issues</ITAG>One issue that has been raised concerning exit row seating is whether thereshould be restrictions on seating persons who have been consuming alcoholin exit rows or on serving alcohol to persons seated in exit rows. Section121.575 of the FAR prohibits a certificate holder from boarding, or servingalcohol to, a passenger who appears intoxicated. In any event, this proposedrule would apply to inebriated persons just as it applies to any otherperson who could not be expected to perform the functions described hereinin an emergency exit row during an evacuation. The FAA seeks comment onwhether more specific requirements are needed on this subject.Another concern that has been expressed relates to the questionable needfor exit row seating restrictions, in light of the allegedly negligibleprobability that a crash would occur with a handicapped person sittingin an exit row. The suggestion is that this limited chance should be balancedagainst the inconvenience to persons who are removed from exit row seatsassigned by mistake or inadvertence.This suggestion overlooks the purpose of crashworthiness rules such asproposed herein. Crashworthiness rules are designed to deal with the post-crashenvironment by creating the greatest possible chance for survivors to escapethe aircraft. Another example of a crashworthiness measure is the use ofseatbelts. Very rarly do passengers encounter turbulence that requiresfastened seatbelts during flight. It is well-established, however, thata fastened seatbelt may be the difference between saving and losing a life.The FAA's goal in this matter is safety for the maximum number of peoplepossible. It is clear from the studies discussed herein that any delayin beginning the flow of persons through an exit works to the detrimentof all those trying to use the exit. The FAA studies show that personswithout handicaps are less likely to cause such delays than are personswith handicaps. The studies also show that a handicapped person, who mightcause a substantial delay at the head of an exit queue, can be accommodatedonce the queue is established and moving without detriment to the flowrate or to his or her own escape through an exit.The FAA seeks any additional studies or data concerning the issues raisedby this rulemaking. For example, FAA has heard references to an evacuationexercise the National Federation of the Blind conducted in conjunctionwith World Airways in 1985. However, FAA has been unable to obtain tapesor other reports relating to that exercise.<ITAG tagnum="84">Requirements for Compliance With the Rule</ITAG>In order to comply with the proposed regulations, certificate holders wouldhave to develop procedures and revise their pertinent handbooks, for reviewand approval by the principal operations inspectors (POI's) at the FAAFlight Standards District Offices that hold their certificates. The procedureswould not become effective until final approval is granted by the Director,Flight Standards Service in Washington.To ensure that the procedures of all certificate holders are consistentwith the regulations, explicit criteria for the selection of exit row occupantshave been included in the proposed rule. To be approved, a certificateholder's procedures would have to include the criteria and address allof the functions enumerated in the proposed regulations as ones that mayfall to a person in an exit row.The procedures also would have to include provisions by each certificateholder to make available at each airport it serves and at each seat affectedby the proposed regulations the information advising the occupying passengerthat he or she may be called upon to perform the enumerated functions.Certificate holders also would have to include provisions for verifyingthe appropriateness of exit row seating assignments prior to takeoff andfor briefing passengers on the need to identify themselves and to moveout of the exit row if they cannot meet the criteria or do not wish tobe responsible for performing the required functions. For example, a proceduremight consist of a flight attendant asking questions to ensure that a personseated in an exit row can hear and understand English. The flight attendantwould then instruct the passenger briefly as to the responsibilities ofsitting in that seat, and the person would indicate whether he or she feltcapable of performing those functions. Any procedure that ensures thatthe criteria are applied in a non-discriminatory manner would be acceptable.The FAA invites comments on the best way to accomplish this.Approval will be based solely upon the safety aspects of the certificateholders' procedures. The FAA's approval of procedures will not insulatethe certificate holder, therefore, from challenges based upon discriminationor other matters not related to safety.As with any changes to Part 121 or 135, certificate holders' procedureswould have to provide for training, as already required by FAA regulationsin 14 CFR Part 121, specifically, andSection;andSection; 121.415, ``Crewmemberand dispatcher training requirements''; 121.417, ``Crewmember emergencytraining''; 135.295, ``Initial and recurrent flight attendant crewmembertesting requirements''; and 135.319, ``Crewmember training requirements''.Accordingly, proposed andSection;andSection; 121.585 and 135.127 contain noseparate requirement for training.In developing the foregoing proposed compliance procedures, the FAA consideredeliminating the requirement for submission of the procedures to the FAAfor approval. The rationale presented for nonsubmission include: (1) Theproposed rule is very explicit and could be implemented with minimal writtenprocedures; (2) passengers with complaints based either on safety or discriminationhave adequate recourse to the FAA or the Office of the Secretary of Transportation,whether or not written procedures have been submitted for approval; and(3) since the rule could be implemented with minimal written procedures,there would be little to review and approve, and the cost of submissionwould not be warranted.On the other hand, the FAA considered the following factors: (1) Representativesof handicapped groups have expressed strong disapproval of the fact thatthe procedures developed by certificate holders under andSection; 121.586,``Authority to refuse transportation'', were submitted solely for reviewand not for approval by the FAA. A compliance mechanism that eliminateseven the submission of the procedures may be considered a step in the wrongdirection, regardless of the proposed rule's increased level of detail;(2) if the procedures are not submitted for approval, the FAA will haveto rely solely on complaints to determine the compliance of the certificateholders; (3) without ready access to the procedures, the FAA will be ina less informed position, when attempting to resolve a problem informally;and (4) there is no guarantee that each certificate holder will interpretthe proposed rule in exactly the same way.The FAA welcomes comments on this matter.The requirements would be applicable to all part 135 air taxi operatorsand commercial operators, as well as to Part 121 domestic, flag, and supplementalair carriers and commercial operators of large aircraft. The FAA consideredlimiting the applicability of andSection; 135.127, however, to aircraft havinga passenger seating configuration of more than 19 passengers.Many small aircraft do not have complicated assist mechanisms, such asevacuation slides, and have fewer types of doors and fewer passengers toevacuate in an emergency. It is conceivable that these factors may makeit less necessary to restrict exit row seating. On the other hand, damageto an aircraft that precludes the use of even one evacuation route mayhave a greater impact in a small aircraft than in a large one. Further,the limited space for movement actually may increase the need for seatingrestrictions. The FAA invites comments on the extent to which the proposedrule should apply to Part 135 commuter and on-demand air carriers and commercialoperators.<ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance Dates</ITAG>As previously discussed herein, the Department of Transportation has proposeda rule to implement the Air Carrier Access Act, to which the FAA's proposedexit row rule relates. It is the intention of the Department that bothproposed rules, if adopted, become effective simultaneously to the extentpossible, to avoid a hiatus between the existing procedures of certificateholders, concerning exit row seating, and the requirements establishedthrough amending Parts 121 and 135.While the Department recognizes that the existing procedures of certificateholders may have many shortcomings, they presently constitute the onlyavailable mechanism for monitoring emergency exit row seating from thestandpoint of safety. The FAA believes that a hiatus would not be in thebest interests of safety and that the present procedures must be used untilproposed andSection;andSection;121.585 and 135.127, if adopted, become effective.The Department also recognizes that both the certificate holders and thehandicapped groups have concerns regarding the timing of the implementation.The certificate holders' concerns relate to the length of time that itwould take to train their personnel before the provisions of both rulesbecome fully effective. The handicapped groups, particularly with respectto Part 382, are concerned that there be no needless delays in the implementationof the provisions. The issue of the timing of the effective dates for bothrules will be resolved on the basis of comments received on this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary</ITAG>Analysis of Benefits and CostsThe FAA has estimated the costs and benefits associated with this proposedrule by analyzing it section by section.This proposal would replace the industry's inconsistent policies and inconstantpractices with a uniformly applicable rule. The proposed rule providesa comprehensive set of procedures, based on explicit criteria, that canbe carried out with only minimal training cost. Changes to the appropriateparts of the crewmembers' manuals and appropriate segments of airlines'training programs are made periodically as a matter of routine. The provisionsof this proposal would be incorporated routinely into those manuals andtraining programs at little additional cost. Factors such as an acceleratedtraining schedule, if used, could result, however, in some additional trainingcosts. Presently, the FAA does not anticipate this will be necessary.The requirement for passengers to comply with instructions, or be subjectto denial of transportation at the discretion of the certificate holder,would impose no cost because such a requirement is presently industry practicereflecting section 902(j) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C.1472(j)).The requirement that certificate holders make available, at each seat affected,information advising the occupant of the functions he or she might be calledupon to perform in an emergency and the requirement that passenger informationcards be presented in multiple languages would cost, at maximum, approximately$310,000 for all potentially affected seats under the proposed applicabilityin both Part 121 and Part 135. The maximum approximate cost per aircraftwould range from $20 to $60 for Part 135 commuters with more than 19 seatsand airplanes operating under Part 121. The maximum approximate cost peraircraft for Part 135 commuters with 19 or fewer seats and for air taxiswould average $5.The cost of making copies of the criteria available at airports would benegligible. The incremental cost of printing the procedures and makingthem available at each airport would range from less than $100 to probablyno more than $1,000 per year for each Part 121 operator and Part 135 commuteroperator, depending on the number of airports each operator serves. Airtaxi operators likely would incur only the negligible costs of using acopying machine to copy the criteria.The requirement for verification of appropriately occupied affected seatsprior to closing all passenger entry doors preparatory to taxi or pushbackwould be accomplished during the currently-required baggage stowage checkwith no delay of flight or incremental cost.The required inclusions in the passenger briefings are minimal expansionsand would be accomplished at no cost.Accommodating a passenger being relocated from an exit row seat when non-exitrow seats are fully booked would involve no cost. That person would notbe denied transportation, nor would any cost result from moving anotherpassenger, who is willing and able to assume the evacuation functions thatmay be required, into an exit row seat.The certificate holder's submission of procedures to the FAA would involvea negligible administrative cost for the transaction.Since no passenger would be denied transportation, there would be no lossof revenue.The potential benefits that would be derived from this proposed rule aresubstantial. The FAA estimates the potential benefits based on a broadbody of information which is discussed in detail elsewhere in this NPRM.Of particular import is the information contained in a study completedin October 1970 by the FAA's Office of Aviation Medicine, entitled ``Survivalin Emergency Escape from Passenger Aircraft'' (Report No. AM-70-16), whichconcluded that in aircraft accidents in which decelerative forces do notresult in massive cabin destruction and overwhelming trauma to passengers,survival is determined largely by the ability of the uninjured passengerto make his or her way from a seat to an exit within time limits imposedby the thermotoxic environment. Seconds can mean the difference betweenlife and death in the aftermath of a crash inasmuch as evacuation mightbe terminated abruptly by an explosion at any point.The reason for this proposed rulemaking is a concern for potential derogationof safety. Any effort to calculate monetary values for expected saved liveswould be speculative, since there is no historical base from which to derivevalid estimates. Nevertheless, the FAA estimates that the proposed ruleswould account for a benefit of substantial numbers of lives saved as contrastedwith potential loss of life in the absence of such regulations.It is obvious that the prevention of only one life lost in an accidentwould alone more than pay for the cost of this proposed rule. The dataclearly indicate that the proposed rule would be justified on a benefit-to-costbasis. Each proposed section in Part 121 and Part 135 is identified andexplained in the detailed section-by-section analysis contained in thefull Regulatory Evaluation placed in the docket.Regulatory Flexibility DeterminationSince there would be only negligible cost associated with this rule foran operator, the FAA has determined that the proposal would not have asignificant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial numberof small entities.Trade Impact StatementSince this proposed rule would affect only Part 121 and Part 135 certificateholders regarding seating of passengers in exit rows, the FAA has determinedthat the proposed regulation would not have an impact on internationaltrade.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that such a regulation does not have federalismimplications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed in the preamble and based on the findings inthe Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade ImpactAnalysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not majorunder Executive Order 12291 and certifies that this rule, if promulgated,will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on asubstantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. This proposal is considered significant under Departmentof Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979). An initial regulatory evaluation of the proposal, includinga Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has beenplaced in the regulatory docket.
