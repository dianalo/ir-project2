Christian had sued the late actor's estate contending Hudsonshould have told Christian he had the deadly and contagious disease.   During the trial, Christian, a former bartender, testified insometimes lurid detail that he continued to have sex unwittinglywith Hudson for months after the actor was diagnosed with AIDS.   The jury ruled in February that Hudson was guilty of``outrageous conduct'' for concealing his AIDS diagnosis fromChristian, his lover for two years.   Although Christian did not contract AIDS and has tested negativefor the presence of the virus, both the judge and jury found hedeserved damages for the extreme emotional distress he suffered.Christian said he didn't learn of the star's illness until a fewmonths before Hudson, 58, died on Oct. 5, 1985.   ``I thought I was a dead man,'' he testified about the terrorthat gripped him in the wake of the disclosure.   Legal scholars said the ruling was unique in personal injury lawconcerning sexually transmitted diseases, because only plaintiffswho developed the diseases have collected damages in previous cases.   In separate deliberations in February, jurors gave Christian$14.5 million in compensatory damages and $7.25 million in punitivedamages.   The judge upheld the verdict and said Hudson's conduct was``outrageous and reprehensible'' because the actor and hissecretary, Mark Miller, agreed to keep Hudson's AIDS diagnosissecret.   But in the 30-page order issued Friday, the judge said, ``Thecourt finds that the jury's award of $14.5 million is so high thatit must be concluded that the award is based in part on passionresulting from the jury's evaluation of the outrageous andreprehensible nature of the conduct of Rock Hudson and defendantMiller.''   ``It is... clear, that the emotional distress at issue here isthe fear of contracting AIDS and, therefore, the fear of anagonizing death is very substantial whether measured in quantity orquality,'' Geernaert wrote.   ``On the other hand, however serious (Christian's) distressmight be when he first learned of Hudson's AIDS, such emotionaldistress would become somewhat less over time.   ``Furthermore, there is no evidence that plaintiff's emotionaldistress has been physically debilitating or that plaintiff hassuffered any tangible economic loss,'' he wrote.   Christian said he was happy with the outcome because it stillsends a message to AIDS patients to inform their sexual partners ifthey have the disease.   Christian's attorney, Harold Rhoden, who said he wasdisappointed by the judge's decision, said Christian accepted thereduction because he does not have the money to continue the courtbattle.   Robert Parker Mills, an attorney for the Hudson estate, said hebelieves his clients will appeal.   ``There's not any evidence I can see that would substantiate a$5 million award to this man,'' said Mills.</TEXT></DOC>
