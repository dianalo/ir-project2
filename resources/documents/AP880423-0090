Growing trees absorb carbon dioxide, the principal gasresponsible for the warming, and break the gas down to incorporatecarbon in their woody tissues. A growing forest also adds carbon tothe soil.   ``It does provide an important lag time ... while we doimportant things in other areas, like re-orient national energypolicies,'' said Lori Heise, a researcher at the WorldwatchInstitute and one of the authors of the study released Saturday.   The institute is a Washington-based environmental researchorganization. It has frequently advocated increased conservationand use of renewable resources to replace fossil fuels.   Carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere in the burning ofall fossil fuels. It warms the earth by trapping heat that normallywould be radiated out to space.   Most scientists believe the earth is warming, with potentiallylarge changes in rainfall patterns, energy demand, crop-growingareas and a rising sea level to threaten low-lying areas.   About 40 percent of the earth's land area, or 12.8 billionacres, is covered with forest, of which about 7.3 billion acres wastropical forest in 1980. The Worldwatch study estimates that about3.2 million acres, an area the size of Connecticut or NorthernIreland, is lost every year.   In their study of current tropical forest issues, Heise andco-author Sandra Postel, estimated that tropical countries need torestore about 250 million acres of forest to repair damage to soilsand streams, 140 million acres to supply fuelwood and 25 millionacres for timbering.   Counting overlap and wood used for fuel in the near term, theyestimated that about 300 million acres of new tropical forest couldextract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while the trees mature,which could be 30 or 40 years from planting.   This would cover an area a bit smaller than Arizona, California,Nevada and Oregon.   In an admitted ``back-of-the-envelope'' calculation, Postel andHeise estimated that the growing trees could remove 860 milliontons of carbon from the atmosphere each year until the treesmatured. This would be about 47 percent of the total carboncurrently being released by forest destruction.   Irving Mintzer, a researcher for the World Resources Institutewho has studied the greenhouse effect, said the estimates of hiscounterpart organization ``are not trivial,'' amounting to about 15percent of carbon released by all fossil fuel combustion. ``But weshould not be seduced into thinking (reforestation) can solve thewarming problem,'' he said.   Slowing the destruction of tropical forests has the additionalbenefit of reducing emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas,Mintzer said.   The World Bank, the World Resources Institute and United Nationsagencies launched an effort in late 1985 to invest $8 billion,counting government and private investments, in reforestation overthe next five years.   The Worldwatch study said the success of the effort would dependon efforts individual countries make, and those in turn woulddepend on mobilizing international private organizations andfoundations and local private groups.   ``Indeed, what is needed in the coming decade is an effortsomewhat akin to the agricultural Green Revolution of the sixties:a dedication to developing genetically improved tree species and toextending widely the technical and financial resources forreforestation,'' said the Worldwatch paper.   To plant the forests they call for by the year 2000 would meanplanting 17 billion trees per year, a massive undertaking, theresearchers said.</TEXT></DOC>
