In 1969, they note, just 4 percentof state legislators were women. After last fall's election, that percentagehad risen to 18.1.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ELECTED WOMEN: ON TRACK?CHANGE IS SLOW IN SOME STATES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Kansas, Oregon and Texas inaugurated women as governors this year, just 16years after Ella Grasso of Connecticut became the first woman elected governorwithout being preceded by her husband.;    But the frustrated analysts mayalso make a compelling case. Only 31 women serve in Congress, accounting forjust more than 5 percent of the seats.;    Percentage keeps growing;    Theyagree the percentage of women in state legislatures continues to grow. But theincrease is at a rate of about 1 percentage point each election year,according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics at RutgersUniversity in New Brunswick, N.J.;    The center, which has just compiledstatistics including the 1990 elections, notes that at that rate it would takeanother 64 years before women reach the 50 percent mark.;    Moreover, whilewomen have made inroads almost everywhere, there are extraordinary differencesamong the states. Arizona, at the top of the list, has a state Legislaturethat is 35.6 percent female. Louisiana's, at the bottom, is just 2.1 percentfemale.;    Crucial indicator;    State legislatures are considered a crucialindicator of women's progress in elective office. They are traditionalpipelines for higher office, either statewide or congressional, and they areat the heart of a state's power structure, handling issues from highways toeducation to worker's compensation. In many states, North and South, they alsoare a contented redoubt of the good ol' boys.;    This situation has gainednew attention since the Supreme Court's 1989 decision in Webster vs.Reproductive Health Services, which gave states new latitude to restrictabortion and thus pushed the issue into the legislatures.;    Source ofoutrage;    It is a special source of outrage for many women to see theabortion issue debated and decided upon by lawmakers who are almostexclusively male. Such was the case in Louisiana, which has three women in its105-member House and no women in its Senate, and which last year passed anextremely restrictive abortion law, ultimately vetoed by Gov. Buddy Roemer.;   &quot;I think women all over the state were struck by the fact that here was oneof the most important issues of our time being debated, and when the camerapanned the floor there were no women to be seen,&quot; said Mary Landrieu,Louisiana's state treasurer and a former legislator. &quot;I think the visual juststruck women: 'Hey, regardless of what side you're on, why aren't we there?'&quot;;    Theories on differences;    There are many theories to explain thedifferences among the states, most of them revolving around a state'spolitical culture.;    How powerful are the parties in controlling who runsfor office and how open are they to women? How much turnover is there in statelegislatures; how many open seats are available to newcomers, male or female?(It is far more difficult to oust an incumbent.) Do the states have traditionsof large, part-time, citizen legislatures, such as New Hampshire, which areoften easier for an outsider to penetrate?;    There are some regional trends.Seven of the 10 states with the lowest percentage of women in theirlegislatures are in the South. Some analysts consider this a reflection of theregion's traditionalist culture.;    Sharon Rodine, head of the NationalWomen's Political Caucus, said she has met with women across the South inrecent months and is convinced that trend is about to change.;    &quot;They'vetaken a close look at their legislatures over the last few elections anddecided there's something wrong with this picture,&quot; she said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910225  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  651  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday February 25, 199100056205,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
