The company is encouraging makers of personal computersand peripherals to display a Windows logo on their productpackaging, advertisements and, in some cases, their machines.One logo indicates that manufacturers have met certaintechnical specifications designed to optimize the performanceof Windows software. Another logo indicates that, besidesmeeting technical criteria, the manufacturer haspre-installed Windows on its PCs.</LP><TEXT>   Dell Computer Corp., Tandy Corp. and Digital EquipmentCorp., three medium-sized PC makers, said they will be amongthe first to participate in the plan. Windows is a programthat makes standard DOS software easier to use by openingmenus or choosing icons with a pointing device. Microsoft,based in Redmond, Wash., has sold nine million copies of itslatest version of Windows since releasing it in May 1990.   Microsoft said it expects other computer makers to use theWindows logo. &quot;We're getting a very good response to the ideafrom manufacturers,&quot; said Jonathan Lazarus, general managerof systems marketing.   Mr. Lazarus said Microsoft hopes the logo plan will helpto redefine the PC standard, making Windows software thedefining characteristic of the PC. Currently, the PC iscommonly defined as a computer that is compatible withmachines from International Business Machines Corp. &quot;I wantto eliminate that whole concept {of IBM-compatibles} forbuyers -- and just have them focus on Windows,&quot; Mr. Lazarussaid.   In launching its logo plan, Microsoft is following thelead of Intel Corp., whose microprocessors serve as theelectronic brains in PCs made by IBM and hundreds of othercompanies. Last July, Intel launched an &quot;Intel Inside&quot;advertising campaign. Nearly every PC maker has displayed theslogan in its ads, with Intel picking up part of the cost forthe campaign.   Microsoft, however, won't be offering any financialincentives to PC makers, some of whom will even make room ontheir machines for the Microsoft logo.   As the dominant supplier of basic software for personalcomputers, Microsoft already is at the center of the PCindustry. The company doesn't make PCs itself, but somewhatinfluences the way manufacturers design their PCs, simply asa way to insure that these machines can run its software.Under the new plan, Microsoft wants to expand its influenceover hardware design by encouraging manufacturers to tailortheir PCs -- and the pieces in them -- to exploit thegraphical features of Windows.   Companies whose PCs satisfy the basic criteria will beoffered one logo; companies that install Windows on their PCswill sport a logo that indicates their machines are &quot;ready torun&quot; Windows. Both Dell and Digital Equipment said theywelcome the chance to display the Windows logo, saying itcould give them an edge over other manufacturers and won'tdilute their own brand names.   &quot;This is one differentiation. We'll be doing this, otherswon't,&quot; said Douglas MacKenzie, manager of PC softwareengineering at Digital, which will begin stamping the Windowslogo on its PCs later this year.   &quot;We definitely intend to use the logoand be very visiblein our use of it,&quot; said Charlie Sauer, Dell's vice presidentof technical strategy.   In the long run, however, identifying too strongly withWindows could make a hardware company's job tougher. &quot;Howdoes a computer maker differentiate between the relativegoodness of their Windows machine vs. someone else's Windowsmachine?&quot; said David Readerman, an analyst at LehmanBrothers. &quot;I'm not sure what they do.&quot;   The Windows logo campaign also seems to be aimed atfurther loosening IBM's hold over the PC market and boostingsupport for a new version of Windows Microsoft is expected torelease in late March or early April. Until last year,Microsoft and IBM more or less worked in concert on basicsoftware for PCs, but now IBM is pushing its own design ofOS/2 software against Windows. IBM's latest version of OS/2,which the company promises will run Windows applications, isdue out at about the same time.   The wrangling is all part of &quot;Microsoft's effort to offersome leadership in response to the rift with IBM,&quot; said RickSherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;The questionis: Who will the {PC makers} follow? IBM or Microsoft?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
