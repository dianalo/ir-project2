General Assembly.   The move is a gesture of moderation by an increasingly isolatedPLO, which has lost some Arab support for siding with Iraq in thePersian Gulf crisis and saw its dialogue with Washington cut offearlier this year over a PLO faction's attack on an Israeli beach.   In a private meeting of Arab ambassadors on Tuesday, Palestinianand other Arab diplomats said PLO head envoy Nasser al-Kidwaproposed that the Arabs vote to accept Israel's credentials.   Credentials of all nations must be approved each year, allowingrepresentation in the U.N. General Assembly.   However, the Arabs would propose an amendment to the officialmembership list that reminds Israel of its obligation to obeySecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions on the MiddleEast.   Security Council resolutions have attacked Israel's declarationof a unified Jerusalem as its capital and, this month, ``deplored''the Oct. 8 Temple Mount killings in which police killed 20Palestinians during a stone-throwing protest in Jerusalem.   General Assembly resolutions call for separate homelands forPalestinians and Jews, and guarantee the right of Palestinianexiles to go home to the new Palestine.   Israel's U.N. mission was informed of the proposal but had noimmediate formal response.   The Arab ambassadors were unable to agree immediately on the PLOproposal. One problem for them seemed to be whether voting forIsrael's U.N. membership, even with those amendments, wouldconstitute recognition of Israel.   ``I think they are very concerned about the implicationsthemselves,'' said one Western ambassador who is an expert on theMiddle East.   The chairman of the Arab group, Kuwaiti Ambassador MohammadAbulhasan, said he would likely ask the General Assembly presidentto delay consideration of the membership issue rather than take itup Thursday, as scheduled.   Israel has been U.N. member since the Jewish state was foundedin 1948.   Since 1982, the Arabs have challenged Israel's right to sit inthe General Assembly, claiming it is not a peace-loving state asrequired by the U.N. Charter.   The Arabs have lost every year, and last year the Soviet Unionabstained on the issue rather than voting with them. This year, theSoviets are expected to vote in favor of Israel.   Al-Kidwa characterized the PLO's move as ``a more positiveapproach'' the Israel-Palestinian issue.   This is the first major new diplomatic move by al-Kidwa, anephew of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. Veteran PLO Ambassador ZuhdiLabib Terzi retired from his 16-year posting as head of thedelegation last month to become an adviser to Arafat. The PLO hasobserver status at the United Nations.   Observers believe that hard-line Arab states such as Syria,Libya and Iraq will not support al-Kidwa's proposal if it is viewedas amounting to some form of recognition of Israel.   In 1948, the newly founded Israeli government was willing toaccept the General Assembly resolutions setting up two states, butthe Arab nations rejected the two-state idea and attacked Israelthe day after it declared itself a nation.   Israel captured about half the land that was supposed to becomean Arab Palestinian state, and the other half was divided betweenJordan and Egypt.   The Israeli government has claimed since then that it needs toretain some of the occupied territory as a buffer against Arabattacks.   In 1988, Arafat became the first Arab leader to endorse thetwo-state concept originally devised by the United Nations.   The PLO lost significant financial and political support fromsome Arab countries after Arafat sided with Saddam Hussein on theIraqi leader's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait. Arafat has since beentrying to play a mediating role.   Saddam has said he wants to link any solution to the crisis withan Israeli pullout from occupied territories and has won thesupport of many of the Palestinians living in those lands.   Washington broke off dialogue with the PLO in June after Arafatrefused to condemn a May 30 raid on a Tel Aviv beach by guerrillasof the Palestine Liberation Front led by Abu Abbas.   There were no Israeli casualties in the attack.</TEXT></DOC>
