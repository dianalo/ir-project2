Col Oliver North appeared briefly before the House Foreign Affairs Committee last December, he said: &quot;No one in America wants to tell this story as much as I do.&quot; But Col. North may not get his professed wish until the election year of 1988.    It is increasingly apparent that Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the Reagan administration's secret arms sales to Iran and aid to Nicaraguan rebels is facing major delays as he hacks a trail through a jungle of secret foreign bank accounts, front companies and middlemen -- to say nothing of competing and at times conflicting investigations into the affair.    Some of the major players now suspect that if they eventually are indicted for their roles in the affair, it won't be until the second half of next year -- which could inject a powerful element of uncertainty into the presidential campaign when it's in high gear.    Many Justice Department and congressional officials figured that the bulk of Mr. Walsh's work would be finished much sooner. But it appears now that key documents and testimony may not even be available to his team of attorneys until late this year or early next year, according to government and private attorneys familiar with the issue.    Many career prosecutors say, and even some of Mr. Walsh's own associates acknowledge, that the special counsel has gotten off to a slower start than anticipated. &quot;I have some real worries about the progress of the Walsh investigation,&quot; says Robert Ogren, a veteran prosecutor who resigned last month as head of the Justice Department's fraud section, but isn't directly involved in the Walsh probe. His sentiments are echoed by several government and defense attorneys participating in the inquiry.    Simply determining the scope of the investigation has proved difficult and time-consuming. Officials say Mr. Walsh received a list of more than 30 pending federal criminal inquiries that could overlap at least to some extent with his jurisdiction, but he wants to assume control over fewer of those cases than the Justice Department suggested.    Given his reputation as a stickler for detail, the 75-year-old former judge clearly is concerned that expanding the scope of his inquiry threatens to strain his limited resources and create further delays. Nevertheless, recent disclosures of a possible cover-up by senior White House or Central Intelligence Agency officials may be forcing him to reassess portions of his overall strategy.    Among other things, Mr. Walsh has ordered a more detailed examination of internal Justice Department and CIA inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair last fall. Investigators, for example, want to know why CIA general counsel David Doherty failed to interview key National Security Council and CIA officials as part of his fact-finding efforts.    In addition to the laborious process of running down leads, Mr. Walsh faces time-consuming efforts to pry bank records out of foreign bank-secrecy havens. &quot;In the past, it has taken us as long as two years to gain access to some Swiss bank accounts,&quot; says one federal prosecutor. &quot;And those cases didn't involve any of the national security or high-level diplomatic questions facing the independent counsel.&quot; Moreover, congressional investigators have submitted their own separate request for access to Swiss bank accounts and records, involving at least several companies and individuals, which could delay things even more.    Securing bank records from Panama or the Cayman Islands is likely to be even tougher, since the U.S. doesn't have treaties for exchanging such information with those countries. But without tracing in detail the flow of millions of dollars in profits from the secret arms sales to Iran, investigators say they may be unable to prove whether anyone violated U.S. laws.    Israel also is balking at cooperating fully with U.S. probes. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir last week reiterated that Israeli middlemen and government officials will provide written statements to U.S. investigators but won't testify about their role. All questions must be addressed to the Israeli government, Mr. Shamir said, &quot;because these people acted on behalf of&quot; Israel.    Besides his conflicts with foreign governments, Mr. Walsh must also keep a wary eye on Congress. Already, a dispute is simmering between the investigations of the two over whether to grant immunity to former national security adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter, fired White House aide Col. North and others; by this summer, the dispute may boil over.    Lawmakers want to complete their probes by the fall, even if that requires granting immunity to some individuals before Mr. Walsh has completed his work. &quot;We take our responsibilities in this regard extremely seriously,&quot; says Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), chairman of the special House committee investigating the covert arms sales. While both sides have made vague promises to cooperate with each other, they appear to be girding for an eventual test of wills -- and a potentially divisive public policy debate.    Mr. Walsh has warned lawmakers that a premature decision to grant immunity would &quot;create serious -- and perhaps insurmountable -- barriers&quot; to prosecution and &quot;would not serve the public interest.&quot;    But Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asserts that even Mr. Reagan's most outspoken critics on Capitol Hill are hoping for a speedy resolution. &quot;Whatever political fallout benefits the Democrats&quot; from dragging out the investigations to the 1988 presidential election, Sen. Biden says, &quot;is far outweighed and overshadowed by the ultimate damage that (delay) would cause to politics and all politicians.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
