(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The words will flow more easily when you have a kit full of the right PCtools at hand OK, you've done your reasearch.andP;  You've brainstormed until yourhead is popping with ideas.andP;  Your outline is perfect.andP;  It's time to write.andM;Uh-oh.andP;  This is the scary part.andP;  Whether your're staring at a blank sheet ofpaper caught in the rollers of a clanky old Remington or at a blank screen ontop of a shiny new PC, the terror is the same.andP;  There's a key differencebetween that old Remington and your PC, however.andP;  The Remington couldn't doanything to help you overcome the terror and the blankness.andP;  Your PC can.andM;The key to putting the PC's potential to work during the writing process isto assemble a personal suite of applications that allow you to organize,develop, and more effectively present your points.andM;The centerpiece of your writing suite should be your word processor, ofcourse.andP;  Which one you use doesn't really matter, however, because during thewriting process your word processor simply plays the part of a glorifiedRemington: it provides a way to get your words onto paper quickly.andP;  Moreimportant is the selection of tools with which you surround it--a goodthesaurus, a stylebook, a text-oriented database for managing your researchnotes, or a file organizer for locating reference information stored on disk.andM;Getting the Right WordsandM;The PC-based thesaurus represents one of the more successful marriages of aclassic reference book and computer technology.andP;  In fact, for the writer thethesaurus's value increases substantially when translated to electronic form.andO;Unlike their bound counterparts, most PC-based thesauruses don't include aantonym dictionary, but the need for antonyms is seldom as pressing as theneed for synonyms.andM;Finding a synonym in a paperbound thesaurus is a tedious process thatinterrupts rather than propels your train of thought.andP;  You must searchthrough indexes and flip through pages until you find the reference you need.andO;An electronic thesaurus, available at the touch of a control key in your wordprocessor, achieves the opposite effect.andP;  It contributes to the flow of wordsby helping you ease around sticky spots in your manuscript.andM;Many of the leading word processors, including WordStar, Microsoft Word, andWordPerfect, provide an online thesaurus.andP;  Don't fret, though, if yoursdoesn't.andP;  Memory-resident thesauruses work with most word processors andusually offer a few more features than their built-in counterparts.andM;One of the most impressive of these is the version of Webster's Thesaurus inFranklin Software's Language Master, which includes both a 470,000-wordthesaurus and a definition dictionary that can be used to check the usage ofmore than 80,000 words.andM;When a particular word has more than one meaning (for instance, remark, whichis both a noun and a verb) some thesauruses will respond only with a list ofsynonyms.andP;  The better thesaurus programs, including Language Master, providesa definition of each usage as well as a list of synonyms for each definition.andM;Though it has a smaller dictionary (20,000 roots and 300,000 synonyms,compared with 40,000 roots and 470,000 synonyms) and no definitiondictionary, Webster's New World On-Line Thesaurus II, from Simon andamp; SchusterSoftware, does offer some attractive features of its own.andP;  These include theability to distinguish articles preceding the word being replaced.andP;  Forinstance, if you select &quot;image&quot; to replace the word &quot;picture&quot; in the phrase&quot;a picture,&quot; Webster's will replace the phrase with &quot;an image.&quot;andM;Webster's also includes a paperbound reference book containing dos and don'tswith examples of trite phrases, wordiness, and words likely to be misused orconfused.andP;  It's valuable material, but having the lists on paper only makesyou wish the authors had put them on disk.andM;Using the Words RightandM;Finding the right word eliminates one roadblock to writing well.andP;  But youstill have to know how to use the words you choose: How do you pluralize acompound noun?andP;  Does this sentence need a semicolon?andP;  How do you address abaroness?andM;For answers to these and a thousand other questions of style and usage, trythe Writer's Handbook and The Associated Press Stylebook, both from DigitalLearning Systems.andP;  The former offers suggestions and background informationon subjects such as grammar, punctuation, business correspondence, andwriting organization and style, while the latter provides specificdefinitions and usage rules for scientific, business, computer, and sportsterms, plus a guide to punctuation, capitalization, abbreviation, andspelling.andP;  Used together, the Writer's Handbook and The Associated PressStylebook provide authoritative answers to almost any style question.andM;Putting Your Finger on ItandM;In addition to style-oriented tools, you should include one or morecontent-oriented applications in your writing suite.andP;  These can help get thewords flowing when the information you need isn't in your notes or outline.andO;Wouldn't it be handy if you could instantly retrieve the information withouthaving to tear through paper files or quity your word processor to searchthrough worksheets one by one?andM;Your PC provides several ways to do so.andP;  One is to use a text-orienteddatabase as a catchall for research notes, ideas, financial projections, andreports.andP;  Unlike a forms-oriented program, a text-oriented database allowsyou to input freeform text of all sorts into a single database file.andP;  Theseprograms index every word you enter and make it possible to locate any wordor phrase almost instantly.andM;The most useful entries in this field are Broderbund's Memory Mate and AskSamSystems' askSam.andM;Memory Mate is about as mean and lean as you can get.andP;  A memory-residentprogram, it performs lightning-fast searches of huge databases and makes iteasy to copy text to and from your application program or to import or exportASCII text files.andP;  It doesn't do much else, but nothing beats it forsearching freeform text databases.andM;askSam is a standalone program that duplicates Memory Mate's basic functionsand adds dozens of others, including support for graphic images in databases,advanced hypertext capabilities, an extensive command language, the abilityto read dBASE files, and advanced report-generation capabilities.andM;Of course, if the information you want to access with a text-orienteddatabase is in another program's files, you must import the files first, andat times it may not be convenient or desirable to do so.andP;  For instance, ifyou need to refer to data found across dozens of files on your hard disk, atext-oriented database program is not the answer--you need to be able tolocate data and copy it into your word processor from the original file,without performing dozens of imports.andM;You can achieve this in a couple of ways.andP;  For truly random or ad hocqueries, nothing beats a rapid search program like Microlytics' GOfer.andP;  Thispop-up memory-resident program reads through every file in the search pathyou specify--or even every file on your hard disk--looking for whatevercombination of words you specify.andP;  It displays the results of its searchonscreen and lets you copy the reference into your word processor.andM;As fast as GOfer is, it can take several minutes to respond if it has tosearch through hundreds of files.andP;  If you want much faster results and arewilling to give up memory-resident operation, Lotus's Magellan can answeryour queries almost instantly.andM;Magellan works by maintaining an index of every word in every file on yourhard disk.andP;  Its index can consume up to 10 percent of your disk drive's totalcapacity (although you can reduce this number by specifying files forMagellan to ignore).andP;  Once Magellan finds all the text, worksheet, database,and other files containing a match or close approximation of the referenceyou want, it displays them in context, one by one, in decreasing order ofexactness.andM;You can speed up the search and keep the size of Magellan's indexes small bymoving all the files you may wish to consult for projects into separatesubdirectories.andP;  Then have Magellan create indexes just for those.andM;Tying It All TogetherandM;If you loaded onto your PC all the memory-resident programs discussed here,you'd consume several hundred kilobytes of RAM, leaving yourself very littlespace for your word processing files.andP;  And you may have to interrupt yourwriting frequently to load and run askSam or Magellan or some other searchprogram--which isn't very conducive to the process of writing.andP;  But if youtie together the applications in your writing suite with an operatingenvironment such as DESQview or Windows, you will be able to move at willamong your word processor, style guide, thesaurus, and text database, or toconsult your outliner or your brainstorming tools whenever necessary.andM;To do this, of course, you'll need a fast PC with lots of extended orexpanded memory.andP;  The old adage that you can write on any PC,no matter howunderpowered, is wrong.andP;  You can word process on an 8088, but to really takeadvantage of all the PC's prowess as a writing tool, you need the mostpowerful PC you can get.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
