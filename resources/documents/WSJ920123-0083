The companyalso faces, as do other implant makers, a proliferation ofliability lawsuits by women seeking millions of dollars inalleged damages.   What's more, the Food and Drug Administration is expectedto decide the future of silicone implants next month.Regulatory options include tight restrictions on the use ofimplants or a total ban.   At a news conference here yesterday, Mr. Rylee also saidthat Dow Corning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. andCorning Inc., is releasing 90 corporate documents, includingthe internal memos and minutes on company meetings that havebeen detailed in the press lately, as requested by the FDA.   For the beleaguered company, it was a sudden about-face.Dow Corning previously had balked at releasing 80 internalmemos and other corporate documents, saying it would makepublic only 10 scientific documents concerning, among otherthings, animal studies.   Mr. Rylee said he believed the memos wouldn't answerquestions about the safety of implants. &quot;By releasing thisold internal company correspondence, we will be doing nothingto address real science and safety issues surrounding breastimplants,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact, we are doing nothing more thanfanning the flames created by contingency-fee lawyers whobase their cases against manufacturers not on what thescientific evidence shows, but on 15-year-old memos thatstate one person's opinion about what research should havebeen done.&quot;   The FDA has been pressuring the company for several daysto release the documents, which are covered by court secrecyorders in two product-liability cases against Dow Corning.The agency plans to present the documents, along with medicalcase reports about immune-system disorders among women withimplants, to an FDA advisory panel in mid-February.   A Dow Corning pull-out would leave just three companies inthe implant industry Bioplasty Inc. of St. Paul, Minn.,Mentor Corp. and Inamed Corp.'s McGhan Medical Corp. unit,both of Santa Barbara, Calif.   Dow Corning's implant business, which accounts for only 1%of revenues, hasn't been profitable recently, according toMr. Rylee. He acknowledged that the business might farebetter in the hands of a &quot;more focused&quot; company whose productlines aren't so diverse.   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Surgitek unit dropped out ofthe implant business in September after saying it couldn'tmeet an FDA deadline for filing scientific evidence thatshowed its products to be safe.   ---   Fowler W.
