However, ASTM andISO coal sampling standards, in general, mathematically treat variancesof mean qualities, i.e., moisture, ash, sulfur, etc., as if incrementswere collected from positions selected randomly from the stream of thetotal consignment of coal. Considerable differences of opinion concerningthe relative efficiencies of systematic and random sampling of coal haveexisted since at least as far back as the early 1950's. Ideally, onecould resolve the matter once and for all by testing a number of workingcommercial sampling systems for precision. However, this is not likelyto be done inn the near future for two reasons. First, neither the needfor acceptable sampling precision nor the methods of measuring samplingprecision are well understood in the industry. Second, the cost of suchan ambitious program might be high, and potential benefits of the resultsare not perceived to offer an immediate payback in current fiscal quarterprofits. In general, our industry is content to let the sleeping doglie. In an attempt to get this matter off dead center, the authors havetaken advantage of a need for an estimate of the precision of a laboratoryscale sampling station. They have conducted an experiment with two purposesin mind. First, the authors wished to obtain estimates of the samplingprecision of the laboratory scale sampling station so as to get a betteridea of the usefulness of the device. Second, they wished to determineif the relationship between systematic sampling variance and the numberof increments collected would be in accordance with that predicted bysome statistical theory.</TEXT></DOC>
