The impending hunt for the giants is an important piece ofTexaco's strategy to remain competitive. The company has beensteadily building its oil reserves by using enhancedtechnology on existing fields it already controls. Its oilreserve base of 2.5 billion barrels could grow by as much as33% by using these techniques, company executives predict.But Texaco must also find completely new prospects to ensureits future, for an oil company's reserves are considered itslifeblood.</LP><TEXT>   Frontier oil exploration is just part of a strategy thathas Texaco fighting to gain a foothold for its refining andmarketing business in many locations globally. The company isespecially interested in the Far East, where petroleum demandwill jump rather than stagnate.   The kickoff of a new phase of work by the Frontier groupis an example of how Texaco is trying to build for the futuredespite a lackluster global economy, which has spurred thecompany to trim expenses by $300 million. &quot;We can producesolid results (even) under the tough economic conditionscaused by the world-wide economic slowdown,&quot; said ChiefExecutive James Kinnear. In the first nine months, Texaco'snet income was $970 million, or $3.46 a share, vs. $1.62billion, or $3.78 a share, during the same period last year.   There is surely an emphasis on exploration with 55% ofthis year's capital spending of $3.6 billion devoted to it.Since it created the Frontier group in 1987, Texaco says thecompany's standing as a player in this type of explorationhas jumped from a ranking of sixth behind all foreignexploration units of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Cos.,Amoco Corp., Exxon Corp., British Petroleum Co. and Total, tosecond place behind the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.   Texaco, which early on held only six foreign frontierplays, or opportunities, now has 25. The company isdeveloping prospects in 20 countries comprising over 75million acres. Efforts have focused on prospects outside theU.S. because oil experts believe there are few opportunitiesfor a major strike within the U.S. Indeed, as a harbinger ofhow oil companies are becoming more involved offshore, morethan half of Texaco's income is already derived from foreignoperations.   A map pinpointing the location of the frontier prospectsshows them strung out through Indonesia, Africa and SouthAmerica, in addition to several in North America. ClarenceCazalot Jr., who heads the group, said in an interview thathe believes the &quot;hottest&quot; of those properties are in Boliviaand Colombia in South America, Angola in West Africa andBulgaria. Texaco is also looking to do more exploration inthe Far East where many prospects are located in shallowwater, as were the initial finds in the prolific U.S. Gulf ofMexico. Within the next two years, 25 to 30 wildcat wellswill be drilled in these areas. And &quot;we're looking to find upto 500 million barrels of reserves with just one or twodiscoveries,&quot; Mr. Cazalot said.   Texaco is working with partners in almost every one of itsfrontier efforts; Mr. Cazelot says that's intended to spreadthe risk, because one or two successes sometimes have tocarry up to 30 failures.   The company has shied away from devoting the efforts ofthis group toward the Middle East, which has already beenheavily drilled. The Frontier effort also doesn't includeTexaco's work in the former Soviet Union -- largely becausethe Timan-Pechora Field, Texaco's primary interest there, hasalready been well-defined by 100 exploration wells drilled bythe Soviets, said Peter Bijur, who oversees the company'swork there and in Europe.   While putting together its portfolio of properties, Texacoalso drilled 14 prospects, of which only three showed anyoil. Work is still continuing at these sites in Paraguay,Alaska and the state of Virginia. But Mr. Cazalot says hedoesn't believe these properties will prove commerciallyfeasible.</TEXT></DOC>
