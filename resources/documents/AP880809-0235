PLC to itscurrent 21.68-percent level.   However, Trade Secretary Lord Young refused to accept thedocuments, and returned them on grounds they would be prejudicialin a review of the stake by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,the Department of Trade and Industry said.   The commission, which currently is reviewing the Kuwaiti holdingin BP, is expected to decide by Sept. 2 whether the stake isanti-competitive or against the national interest.   Young is to decide what action to take in light of thecommission's findings.   The London-based Kuwaiti office said it also pledged not toexercise voting rights representing more than 14.9 percent of theoil giant's shares.   The office also promised not to use its stake ``to further anyother commercial or political interest of Kuwait.''   In addition, the office agreed not to seek representation onBP's board of directors, and not to oppose the election of any BPboard members proposed by the board.   The Kuwaiti office's law firm, Stephenson Harwood, said thepledges were designed to make legally binding the assurances whichthe office already has given to the British government about its BPstake.   ``In order to put beyond doubt that it regards itself as boundby the assurances already given, the state of Kuwait has enteredinto binding covenants, intended to be enforceable by the Britishgovernment in the British courts, which confirm that its interestin BP is that of an investor only,'' Stephenson Harwood said.   The Kuwaiti office stressed the legal documents were signed``entirely on its own initiative'' and not under pressure from theBritish government or commission.   The office began aquiring the stake in British Petroleumpiecemeal after the government sold off its remaining 31.5 percentstake in the oil company last fall. The 7.5 billion-pound, or $13billion, share sale coincided with the stock market crash, whichdepressed the market price of the oil company's stock.</TEXT></DOC>
