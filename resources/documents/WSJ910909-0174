Politicians have been telling native Hawaiians to hang onfor 70 years, ever since Congress passed the Hawaiian HomesCommission Act in 1921, setting aside nearly 200,000 acres inscattered tracts across the islands. Congress hoped to savethe dying Hawaiian people by returning a small portion ofland taken from them in what even a U.S. president had calledthe unlawful federal seizure of Hawaii in 1893.                                                                                                          The federal act requires the state to lease modestresidential, farm and pastoral homestead lots for $1 a yearto any Hawaiian with at least 50% native ancestry. Itinstructs the state to provide the infrastructure ofutilities, roads and water. And it promises to provide nativeHawaiians with home and farm loans to get started.   But many decades later, more than 60% of the land has beenrented at bargain-basement prices to non-natives -- many ofthem belonging to the richest and most powerful families inthe islands -- or swapped or simply given away to othergovernment agencies. The area where Mr. Afong hoped to raisea few head of cattle, for example, has been leased for manyyears by Parker Ranch, the nation's second-largest privateranching business. The ranching corporation pays the state$3.33 an acre each year to use the property, locking up27,000 acres of homelands.   &quot;It's not like we are paying nothing,&quot; says Robert L. HindIII, Parker Ranch's livestock manager. And he says ParkerRanch has helped out the native Hawaiians -- for instance, byleasing them cows to get started.   Other land has gone to multinational corporations forquarrying and mining operations, to the U.S. military for thePacific naval headquarters, to state agencies for waste-watertreatment plants and airports and cemeteries, to mayors andlegislators for their own private companies and personalestates, to prominent businessmen for auto dealerships andshopping strips and tourist attractions, and to shrewdinvestors who have turned around and subleased the propertyfor as much as eight times their rent.   Native Hawaiians, who are the poorest and most ill-housedpopulation in the state, hold just 17.5% of the acreage. Inthe law's entire history, only 3,700 of the tens of thousandsof families who have been eligible have actually been allowedto settle on the homelands. While about 5,800 families havebeen awarded land, the state bars more than a third of themfrom moving onto their land because it lacks basicinfrastructure -- which the state itself is supposed tobuild.   Others do have homes, built under government programs bysubcontractors, but many of the structures are falling apartor deemed substandard by state inspectors. Meanwhile, nativeHawaiians who have applied for homelands languish on aballooning waiting list, now 21,000 names and decades long.   State officials maintain they are at least compensatingthe native Hawaiians in other ways, albeit belatedly: Thestate agreed last year to make up for the seizure of morethan a million acres of native lands 100 years ago by payinga cash settlement to a state agency that aids nativeHawaiians. They say they are making some progress in awardinghomelands, but that implementing the law has been frustratedby a lack of funds, which are needed to provide loans to thehomesteaders as well as for roads and utilities. So, theysay, they must lease land to non-natives to generate revenuefor the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, which administersthe act.   The department's director, Hoaliku Drake, says shebelieves applicants for homelands are &quot;mostly high middleclass. A lot of them own land already.&quot; She adds, &quot;Peopleshould be disciplined enough to wait.&quot; As for the substandardhouses, she says, &quot;Well, they're probably just getting alittle old.&quot;   A number of outside audits conducted on behalf of variousstate and federal agencies have found the homelandsdepartment plagued by bureaucratic incompetence andunderfunding. A 1983 joint federal-state task force, aHawaiian governor, a state attorney general and severalcourts have concluded that the state government hasconsistently violated the 1921 act.   Little has been done about the violations, however, inpart because the act itself authorizes only the federalgovernment, not native Hawaiians, to sue the state forbreaking the homelands law. And the federal government hasnever taken legal action.   At the U.S. Interior Department, the homelands'administrative agency on the federal level, officials saythey feel no obligation to enforce &quot;that darn law,&quot; asTimothy Glidden, the Interior Department's sole designatedofficer for the homelands act, refers to it. &quot;I have a wholepage full of other responsibilities,&quot; says Mr. Glidden. &quot;Ispend very little time on it.&quot;   Hawaii has a strong economy and huge cash reserves: Stategovernment boasted a $456.3 million surplus in fiscal 1991.But many of the 50,000 native Hawaiians currently eligibleunder the 1921 act haven't participated in the boom.According to a 1990 state-sponsored study of the 200,000people who are any part native Hawaiian, more than 2,000 ofthem live in cardboard boxes, rusted cars or on the beaches-- and 40% of the homeless Hawaiians have been on the waitinglist for a homestead for more than seven years. As thestate's housing crisis mounts, the number of native Hawaiianson the waiting list has ballooned, more than doubling in thepast six years even though officials have at times purged thelist of inactive names.   Until recently, the state allocated very little money forthe homelands department -- it has had the smallest staff andbudget of any state agency -- and the federal governmentallocated no funds at all. But at the same time, whenfinancing is available, the agency has been slow to takeadvantage of it. Indeed, the federal government has allocated$1.2 million for the department every year since 1988 -- andthe department has spent none of it. At one point, a localcircuit court judge actually ordered the department torequest funds from the state Legislature.   In addition, in the past two decades the homelandsdepartment allowed millions of dollars of statecapital-improvement-project bond funds to lapse unspent,state records show. It has also left $24 million in cashuntouched in various banks. &quot;Because of delays, we haven'tbeen ready to use that money,&quot; says the agency's deputydirector, John Rowe.   Moreover, he says the costs of many construction projectswere higher than expected, and rather than seek morefinancing from the government, the department just decided tolet the bonds lapse. &quot;If {the bids} were above {the cost ofthe project}, we chose not to go through with it, becausewe'd have to go back and get more funds,&quot; he explains.   Yet the department has spent plenty of money to helpdevelop homelands leased by non-natives, a list of whom hasread over the years like a Who's Who of state politics andbusiness. They have included J. Atherton Richards (the lateformer trustee of the powerful Bishop Estate charity, who hada 9,370-acre ranch on homelands), Diamond Head developer andAloha Air founder Ruddy F. Tongg (who had a 1,126-acre ranch)and state legislator Harvey Tajiri (who operates his campaignheadquarters and auto body shop on homelands and who, in theearly 1980s, made a substantial profit off the land bysubletting it for six times the amount he was paying theDepartment of Hawaiian Home Lands).   &quot;I'm a businessman,&quot; Mr. Tajiri says, and people whoobject to his making a profit off the homelands &quot;don'tunderstand business.&quot; Mr. Tajiri says his position played norole in getting the land. &quot;Being in a public office actuallyworks to my disadvantage,&quot; he says, &quot;because a lot of thingsget misinterpreted to mean that I have favorable treatment.So I have to watch my step even more.&quot;   Mr. Tongg's son Ronald, who most recently ran Tongg Ranch,says, &quot;I don't have any qualms&quot; about having rented nativeHawaiian land since 1966 for less than $6 an acre per year.&quot;My thing doesn't have anything to do with their thing,&quot; hesays of the native Hawaiians. &quot;To be perfectly frank, if theyhaven't gotten their land or it's been mismanaged orwhatever, that's their problem. I don't mean to be so coldand uninterested, but when you get right down to it, that'sthe bottom line.&quot; Mr. Tongg says that after his 25-year leaseexpired a few months ago, he decided not to renew because thedepartment wanted to raise the rent &quot;four to five times,&quot; anincrease that Mr. Tongg deemed &quot;incredible.&quot;   The homelands agency recently allotted $1.4 million toease traffic and put up street lights around Prince KuhioShopping Center, a sprawling mall in Hilo built on homelandsleased by non-natives. The department also put in a roadthere because &quot;we thought it would be a good addendum to theshopping center,&quot; says Mr. Rowe, the agency's deputydirector. And it has spent millions of dollars installinginfrastructure in two industrial parks that serve onlynon-native lessees. Mr. Rowe says that expenditure wasacceptable because it &quot;was designated `economicdevelopment.'&quot;   On Kawaihae, on the northern coast of the Big Island,nearly 200 native Hawaiians have been awarded homeland lots,but they have been waiting since 1986 for basic capitalimprovements, such as running water and electricity, to maketheir land livable. The homelands department received a$990,000 appropriation to install the infrastructure in 1979,before the land was even awarded, but delayed so long theappropriation lapsed unspent.   Mr. Rowe says the funds were allowed to lapse because whenthe department considered using the money, the amount itwanted to spend exceeded the state's annual cap on theagency's expenditures.   Mr. Rowe says Kawaihae is still in the &quot;design stages.&quot;The department forbids homesteaders to move onto their ownland before the infrastructure is in place, and often evictsthose who try. Joanie Dela Cruz and her sister Josephine eachgot awarded half-acre lots at Kawaihae after years on thewaiting list, but they weren't permitted to settle on them.Between them they have three jobs -- Josephine works all daycleaning rooms at a nearby resort hotel and half the nightdelivering newspapers. But she still can't afford the highHawaii rents.   So first, the sisters and their four children squatted ona nearby beach for two years, until the police threw themoff. &quot;The Hawaiian has no home but the beach,&quot; says JoanieDela Cruz. Frustrated, they quietly moved onto Josephine'sboulder-strewn plot with their four children, erecting aplywood shack and bathing in a nearby public restroom.   Last year, the department sent Josephine Dela Cruz aletter warning her she might be evicted. After an extendedbattle, she thwarted the move by securing a county buildingpermit.   Many of the more than 1,000 native Hawaiians who havereceived homes from the department find the problems don'tend after they claim occupancy. On the east coast of Kauai,&quot;Auntie&quot; Rachel Rapozo lives in a development of more than 60homes built under a department contract in the 1970s. She andher husband moved here after spending 30 years on the waitinglist. First, she recounts, the sewage backed up -- again andagain and again. Then the floor started sinking. Then theroof began caving in and had to be replaced. Now the secondroof is collapsing. The electrical wiring is hazardous andhardly works. &quot;I have only two lights here,&quot; she says, as shemoves in the dim house, stepping around the pots that collectwater from the many roof leaks. &quot;Try staying in darkness for10 years.&quot;   While Mrs. Drake, the department director, says the onlyproblem is that the homes in the development are getting old,her public relations director, Hardy Spoehr, who is sittingby her side as she speaks, interrupts to say: &quot;There were alot of problems actually with those homes.&quot; He adds: &quot;We'rebuilding the roofs for the third time. . . . There have beensewage problems that have resulted from freak, well, notfreak but -- ah, not an understanding of the topography underthose homes.&quot;   Most of the non-native lessees obtained their land rightsillegally, because the 1921 act reserved the land fornatives. Leasing to non-natives was supposedly allowed undera 1965 state law that empowered the department to rent tonon-natives, but that didn't make it legal because thefederal statute can be amended only by Congress. It wasn'tuntil 1986 that Congress approved the practice as part ofblanket approval of a raft of amendments that the state hadmade without congressional authorization since Hawaii'sstatehood.   By that time, former state legislator and Maui Mayor ElmerCravalho, who sponsored the 1965 bill, had already beenenjoying his 15,000-acre homelands plantation for 19 years.After the bill passed, he was one of the first non-natives tosign up, at $1.60 an acre a year. He now pays $2.50 an acre.&quot;Where is the conflict of interest?&quot; he asks in response to aquestion. He says his support for leasing to non-natives&quot;contributed greatly to the financial capability&quot; of thehomelands program.   Sometimes the department has simply given property away tonon-natives for a game reserve, military depot or the like.In 1984, Gov. George Ariyoshi ordered the department torescind nearly 30 of these illegal deals, covering about30,000 acres. The state attorney general, meantime, decreedthe U.S. Navy's occupation of 1,400 acres of prime homelandsnear Honolulu to be a &quot;fundamental breach of trust.&quot;   But the department, in most cases, rescinded theagreements only on paper. It has not evicted the offendingland users, which include state and federal agencies. TheDepartment of Hawaiian Home Lands made one attempt to evict,mounting a court challenge to the U.S. Navy's occupancy ofOahu homelands. But the judge found that the department hadwaited too long to sue.   Even when the department charges non-natives for leases,the rates are often bargains. At least 15 non-natives inrecent years have subleased their homelands to others at asubstantial profit, state records show. The department onceconsidered appropriating some of the profits, but abandonedthe plan when the lessees threatened legal action. One ofthem, George Madden, a wealthy developer, calls the agency'sefforts &quot;obnoxious.&quot; By leasing homelands, he says, &quot;I amcontributing to those 20,000 people {on the waiting list}drawing nearer to realization of their homes.&quot;   Actually, only a tiny handful are getting anywhere on thelist. At the beginning of 1990, the homelands departmentannounced it would build 448 new houses during the year. Itbuilt 16. Last fiscal year, the department gave out only 30loans to the thousands of applicants. &quot;We aren't ready withthe loans because there have been some delays in putting ininfrastructure,&quot; explains Mr. Rowe.   Sonny Kaniho's family has been on the waiting list fornearly 40 years; he is one of 139 so-called &quot;Aged Hawaiians&quot;who applied for lots in 1952 but never got them. His father,also on the list, died waiting. His grandparents, ironically,were evicted from their land when the state laid claim to108,000 acres on the Big Island under the 1921 act.   When Mr. Kaniho retired in the 1970s, after 24 years inthe U.S. Navy, he went to Honolulu to inquire about the 1952list. Department officials told him the list &quot;never existed,&quot;he says. At the state archives, he found it without muchtrouble -- published in a 1952 newspaper. Mr. Kaniho was No.14. It took years and a court battle to force the departmentto reinstate the list, which it finally did in 1984. Still,the Aged Hawaiians waited for their land.   In the meantime, politically influential native Hawaiians,including homeland department officials, were moved ahead ofthe claims of the Aged Hawaiians, receiving large parcels. In1965, Albert Akana, the agency's project manager on the BigIsland, was jumped past more than 100 people on the 1952 listto get a 300-acre ranch. &quot;Yeah, I was lower down on thelist,&quot; says Mr. Akana, who says the department picked him toserve as a &quot;role-model&quot; rancher to other Hawaiians. Hisranching effort fizzled, however, and he used the land tobuild and sell boats.   Mr. Kaniho, on the other hand, was repeatedly arrested andserved jail terms for trespassing on homeland pastures inprotest of the Aged Hawaiians' treatment. Finally, last fall,just before the statewide election, the homelands departmentannounced it would award some land to the Aged Hawaiians.Then it revealed that the size of the lots would be reduced.Homestead pasture lots, as opposed to residential lots, aresupposed to be 300 acres because it takes at least that muchacreage to sustain livestock on the arid land. But the lotsnow were cut to as small as 10 acres. And Mr. Rowe says itprobably will take &quot;years&quot; before there will be any water,utilities or roads. &quot;The land is pretty much useless,&quot; saysMr. Kaniho, now 69 years old. His lot is above the frostline.   Native Hawaiians who have farmed and ranched the homelandsfind they often are crowded out by the big non-nativecorporations that lease neighboring homelands. On Kauai,Hawaiian homesteaders have less than 900 acres, while theKekaha Sugar Co., a subsidiary of giant Amfac Inc., leasesabout 15,000 acres of homelands at $3.79 an acre. KekahaSugar also has exclusive rights to all the available waterfrom the nearby Waimea River and the entire network ofirrigation ditches.   With little water, only two native Hawaiians still try toranch their land. One of them is Joe Manini, whosegrandparents were driven off their ancestral land on Kauai atgunpoint in the 1890s. He received permission in writing fromthe Hawaiian Homes Commission, which supervises thedepartment, to tap into Kekaha's irrigation ditch. But in1989, when he installed his pipe, the company got aninjunction. The court ruled that the sugar company had avalid prior claim on the water, and that Mr. Manini's use ofthe water would cause the company &quot;lost income&quot; and&quot;irreparable harm.&quot;   The department didn't back him up. Mr. Rowe says thatwhile Mr. Manini did have the department's permission to tapinto the ditch, &quot;at the same time we were in the process ofnegotiating with Kekaha&quot; and the department didn't want tojeopardize the negotiations. What became of these talks? &quot;Idon't know,&quot; Mr. Rowe says. &quot;I think we are stillnegotiating.&quot;   Mr. Manini, however, says the department is &quot;only ablockade to Hawaiians getting on the land.&quot; His herd is downto four skinny cows. He supports his children and diabeticwife with two jobs. Nights he pumps cesspools. Days he worksas a tractor operator for the Robinson Sugar Co.   Gov. John Waihee, the first part-Hawaiian governor, whoseown father died while on the waiting list, has taken somesteps to increase state funding of the homelands department.He also promoted passage of a bill that allows nativeHawaiians to sue over violations of the 1921 act in somecircumstances. &quot;Only in the past few years has the programbegun to turn around despite the odds,&quot; he says. His policieshave &quot;begun to pay off,&quot; he says.   But the right-to-sue bill bars suits over violations thatoccurred before 1988. And if native Hawaiians win anydamages, the bill requires them to give the money to theOffice of Hawaiian Affairs -- a controversy-plagued agencythat many native Hawaiians don't trust. During the firstthree years of Gov. Waihee's first term -- through 1989, thelatest year for which statistics are available -- theawarding of home lots slowed even more, while the amount ofacreage leased or licensed to non-natives climbed by another8,319 acres, department records show. Gov. Waihee says theawarding of home lots slowed because his administration hadmade installing infrastructure on the homelands a &quot;majorpriority.&quot;   Fed up, about 19 families on the waiting list took tosquatting a few years ago on a homeland beach on Kauai calledAnahola, a Hawaiian word meaning &quot;time set aside.&quot; It is abeach the county wants to turn into a park for tourists. Thefamilies planted a community garden, tapped the countyelectric lines and built a big Aframe in the sand. &quot;My fatherwaited all his life for his land,&quot; says Michael Grace, theAnahola squatters' unofficial leader. &quot;That's not going tohappen to me.&quot;   But in July, a few days after eclipse-gawking tourists hadleft the islands, state police and the National Guardarrested the squatters for trespassing and bulldozed theA-frame.   Mrs. Drake, the homelands department director, says thesquatters weren't playing fair. &quot;They should wait theirturn,&quot; she says. &quot;They should follow the list.&quot; But onesquatter, Daniel Manaku, has no faith in this system.   &quot;It's a hit list, that's what it is to me,&quot; he says. &quot;Theyput you on a list and they let you die.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
