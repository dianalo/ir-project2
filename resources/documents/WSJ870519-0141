Alpha Solarco, which designs, develops and constructs proprietary photovoltaic solar energy equipment, said the projects each will consist of 35,000 kwh of photovoltaic generating capacity and 35,000 kwh of natural gas-fired cogeneration.    The contracts are with the Pawnee and Otoe-Missouria tribes of Oklahoma.    Between 20% and 25% of the financing is expected to come from available government grants, with the remainder obtained through limited partnerships, an Alpha Solarco spokesman said.    The spokesman said the company initially will build a 500 kwh demonstration plant for between $1 million and $2 million.    The demonstration plant will be financed with money raised through a $4.2 million secondary offering of common stock in Alpha and a subsidiary, Solectric Corp. The spokesman said the offering of 6,058,635 units, each consisting of one share of Alpha and one share of Solectric held by Alpha. As a result of the offering, which closed May 11, Alpha's stake in the subsidiary decreased to about 40% from about 60%, the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
