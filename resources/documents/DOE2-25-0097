Asystem for generating steam utilizing the waste heat as well exothermicgas was developed aiming at saving energy. A test of the apparatus wasmade for commercialization. The steam line from the exothermic gas generatorprovided with the waste heat boiler was connected to the steam line ofthe existing boiler so that the on-off control made to reduce the steamgenerated in the existing boiler so much for saving energy. The specialfeatures of the apparatus are as follows: the composition of gas is stableeven decreasing the temperature of the combustion chamber when the combustioncondition is good and the mixing ratio of feed gas is constant; the exothermicgas free from soot can be produced; the combustion can be turned down;and the floor space is smaller than that for a conventional apparatusbecause the gas generator serves concurrently as the boiler.
