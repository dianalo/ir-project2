The Sioux Falls, S.D., meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co., can appeal the citations to an OSHA review panel. Company officials didn't return calls seeking comment.    The citations are the latest in a string of charges brought by the Labor Department's job-safety agency against employers for record-keeping violations.    The agency said its &quot;willful&quot; citations were issued for improperly recorded injuries ranging from an amputation to lacerations, fractures, eye injuries and a chemical burn. The agency said that in most of the cases, company records said only medical treatment was required when, in fact, the injuries and illnesses resulted in lost workdays or restricted activity for workers.    A &quot;willful&quot; citation involves instances when an employer either knew that what was being done constituted a violation or was aware that a hazardous condition existed and didn't make any reasonable effort to eliminate it.    OSHA officials said the citations resulted from an inspection of the Morrell plant last fall. Officials said the agency's investigation indicated a &quot;willful pattern of understating and misrepresenting the injuries and illnesses which have occurred at the meatpacking plant.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
