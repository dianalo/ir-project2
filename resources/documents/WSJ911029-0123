Butdanger still lurks underneath the bombed ruins in the form ofthousands of canisters of deadly nerve gas, some of which areslowly leaking into the desert. The rubble also covers manyembarrassing secrets.   United Nations inspectors are conducting a month-longsurvey of the site as part of a new and crucial phase oftheir work: They hope to pinpoint the companies, the peopleand the nations that sent the supplies, chemical expertiseand machinery that helped Iraq build this lethal facility,which holds more than 800 tons of poison gas.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There was major foreign involvement in this program,&quot;asserts Johan Molander, a special adviser to the U.N.commission coordinating the inspection teams.   According to Mr. Molander, Iraq's chemical arsenalresulted from a massive end run around the world's controlson chemical weapons. Iraq, he says, had help from the West,from former Communist-bloc nations and from emergingindustries in the Third World. Documents and labels onchemical supplies and machinery, Mr. Molander believes, willgive the U.N. a good idea of the culprits involved. And thelethal concoctions that saturate the area should deter anylast-minute Iraqi attempts to spirit the evidence away.   The inspection at Muthanna, two hours' drive north ofBaghdad, is part of a continuing detective story that willtell as much about the world's industrialized nations, thelimits of their intelligence capabilities and their greed, asit will about Iraq's clandestine weapons programs.   It will also test the U.N.'s resolve to bring Iraq'shelpers to justice, a difficult and politically chargedprocess that will eventually result in a list of offenders.&quot;We shall in no way help to cover up suppliers which havecircumvented proliferation agreements. That's the bottomline,&quot; asserts Mr. Molander, a Swedish diplomat with longexperience in the chemical-weapons area.   But first there is much sorting out to do, he says. Thereare &quot;innocent companies&quot; that contributed to Iraqi effortsthat were unknown and, therefore, not banned by internationalcontrols. For example, Iraq had a multibillion-dollar programto build as many as 240 huge electromagnetic uranium-isotopeseparators, devices abandoned by the U.S. after its World WarII Manhattan A-bomb project.   No one had thought Iraq would ferret the details of theprocess out of libraries and make it more efficient as aproducer of highly enriched uranium, an explosive metal usedin nuclear warheads. &quot;Nothing in these machines is on anyexport-control list,&quot; notes Mr. Molander.   Then there is a shadier area. Some companies may havedeceived export controllers by selling Iraq so-calleddual-use equipment -- technology with both weapons andpeaceful applications -- knowing full well that Iraq wantedthem for weapons. In other cases, the companies may have beendeceived by Iraqi front companies. The list of business firmsinvolved in this dual-use area also includes major banks,according to U.S. officials who have seen parts of it.   Doubts were often overcome by Iraqi cash. For example,after the so-called Australia Group of 20 industrial nationsbanned shipments of chemical-weapons ingredients, developingnations took over the business. J.P. Perry Robinson, achemical-weapons expert at Britain's University of Sussex,believes that U.N. inspection lists will show that companiesfrom Singapore, India and Malaysia contributed supplies toMuthanna's shattered warehouses.   &quot;What the Australia Group has done is create a newmarket,&quot; asserts Mr. Robinson, who says it will remain legalfor Third World suppliers to peddle chemical-weaponsmaterials until a treaty banning the manufacture of chemicalweapons, currently being negotiated among 40 nations, issigned.   Finally, there is an area bordering on treason where statesecrets were either sold or given to Iraq. &quot;We have focusedtoo much on the widgets,&quot; says Leonard S. Spector, aresearcher with the Carnegie Endowment for InternationalPeace, who publishes an annual survey of nuclearproliferation. &quot;You have to ask where the blueprints camefrom,&quot; he says. &quot;To me, that's criminal with a capital C.&quot;   There are at least three secrets of foreign states thathave turned up in the U.N. inspections of Iraq. One is aFrench process for uranium enrichment that uses chemicals tocollect the unstable uranium isotope U-235, which isconcentrated to make so-called enriched uranium. The processwas touted by the French in the 1980s as a way of slowingnuclear proliferation because it can only be used to enrichuranium to low levels. According to Mr. Molander, though,Iraqi scientists may have used the process to feed theirelectromagnetic devices, making it easier for them to producethe highly enriched uranium needed for warheads.   Another secret that turned up is a design for anotherenrichment process, a gas centrifuge used by Urenco, aconsortium of British, Dutch and German companies. The designof the ultrahigh-speed centrifuge, regarded as a state secretby all three countries, is reported by the U.N. to be &quot;veryclose&quot; to machines being prepared by the Iraqis.   Finally, according to Mr. Molander, the U.N. inspectionteam that collected 25,000 pages of nuclear documents lastmonth has found what appear to be nuclear-weapons designs. &quot;Abomb design will be traceable,&quot; says Mr. Spector, whobelieves that China may turn out to be the father of theIraqi design.   Iraq's many nuclear innovations have spurred the world'sNuclear Supplier Group, a club of 26 nations, including theU.S., that have agreed to ban exports of certain types ofnuclear equipment and materials. It has begun negotiatingexport controls on dual-use equipment, such as exotic machinetools, that are useful for building a bomb. &quot;Iraq is turningout to be a godsend,&quot; says one State Department official, whobelieves the pressure resulting from the U.N. findings willresult in an agreement by the end of the year.   Meanwhile, members of the U.N. inspection team at Muthannawill be trying a few innovations of their own. One of them isa scheme to get a poison-gas manufacturing facility at thesite, housed in one of the few buildings that remainstanding, to work backward. According to Mr. Molander, Iraqiengineers have agreed to rearrange and operate the plant soit turns Iraqi-made nerve gas into relatively harmlesschemical salts, which will then be mixed with concrete andburied.</TEXT></DOC>
