Israel radio said the army was investigating whether the car wasrigged with explosives as part of a suicide mission or hit a roadmine.   In Beirut, an anonymous caller told a Western news agency thatthe driver of the Renault was on a ``heroic suicide operation''aimed at an Israeli army convoy.

The zone, a target of frequent attacks by Shiite Moslem andPalestinian guerrillas, is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli troopsand more than 1,000 members of the Israeli-backed South LebanonArmy militia.</TEXT></DOC>
