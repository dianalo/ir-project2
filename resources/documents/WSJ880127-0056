Both countries have expressed a strong interest in gaining direct access to foreign oil markets through investments in refining and marketing operations, and both are believed to be eyeing the U.S.    But the close connections of Coastal Chairman Oscar Wyatt Jr. to numerous major oil exporting countries -- including most members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- means the company could be in discussions with any number of potential purchasers.    &quot;These discussions have gone on for more than a few weeks,&quot; a Coastal spokesman said.    Coastal's six U.S. refineries have the capacity to process 322,000 barrels of crude oil a day, representing nearly 6% of total U.S. oil-refining capacity. The company's total sales of refined products are much greater -- about 620,000 barrels a day, which are marketed through some 233 refined-product terminals and about 850 gasoline stations in 22 states. Coastal lately has expanded its gasoline retailing operations in the Northeast under the Derby trade name.    Refineries lately have been selling at roughly one-quarter of their replacement value, which, in the case of Coastal, would indicate a value, for the refineries alone, of anywhere between $200 million and $350 million, refining consultants said.    But a sale to a foreign buyer could fall in a huge price range, the consultants added. On the one hand, Coastal has limited retailing capacity, and &quot;the foreign buyers we've worked with want integration from front to back,&quot; or from refinery to filling station, said John Jenkins, managing director of Houston-based Pace Consultants.    At the same time, though, foreign producers have in some cases paid above-market prices for refineries that give them access to U.S. markets. Petroleos de Venezuela, the country's national oil company, in the last two years has been the most aggressive foreign entrant into U.S. refining, buying 50% interests in certain refining operations of Southland Corp. and Union Pacific Corp.    Even in the depressed year of 1986, Coastal's refining and marketing operations had sales of $3.35 billion. For the first nine months of 1987, Coastal had net income of $78.1 million, or $1.43 a share, on revenue of $5.37 billion.    The company said that if any sales occur -- noting that there isn't any guarantee they will -- Coastal would continue to operate the refining assets and use any proceeds to reduce its huge debt level and for other corporate purposes. A big infusion of cash could also mean that Coastal and its acquisition-minded chairman once again would be on the takeover trail.    Many oil economists see a strong incentive for oil buyers and sellers to strike more of the very transactions that Coastal is negotiating. U.S. oil refiners are generally short of their own supplies of crude oil; many oil-rich foreign countries, meanwhile, are locked in a battle for market share in the consuming countries.    &quot;What you're doing is giving up half the profits&quot; if a half-interest is sold, said a Coastal official. &quot;What you're getting is a source of supply, and the producer gets access to a market.&quot;    The official said that it's possible not all of Coastal's refineries would be sold to a single foreign oil producer. And sales could involve &quot;one or more&quot; buyers, he said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Coastal shares closed at $29.50, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
