The warnings are making members of Congress nervous just twomonths after they enacted a $50 billion, three-year bailout of thesavings and loan industry.   Legislators remember all too well the reassurances they heardfrom regulators and industry executives while the Sandamp;L business wascrumbling, and how quickly hints of trouble mushroomed into themost dire financial crisis since the Depression.   Two well-known banking economists, Robert E. Litan of theBrookings Institution, a liberal think tank, and R. Dan BrumbaughJr. of Stanford University, report that commercial banks, thoughbetter off as a whole than Sandamp;Ls, may be heading for troublethemselves.   Litan, appearing before the Senate Banking Committee last week,warned that about two-thirds of the reserves in the Federal DepositInsurance Corp.'s bank fund will be needed for banks that are weakor already insolvent.   At the end of June, the FDIC's bank reserves totaled $14.5billion. But Litan and Brumbaugh say their analysis of bank datathrough March shows that $9.5 billion of that is needed to coverlosses at banks that are insolvent or close to it, leaving only athin $5 billion layer of protection before taxpayers would becalled on to bail out the fund.   A post-Depression record of 221 banks failed last year. So farthis year, 167 have closed or required government assistance tostay open _ 116 in Texas.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman says he expects failures forall of 1989 to be slightly below last year and to decline furtherin 1990.   However, a study by analyst William C. Ferguson of Irving,Texas, casts doubt o that. He said that 443 banks of 13,000nationwide have been losing money consistently from 1987 throughthe first quarter of this year.   ``In spite of the high reported earnings of the banking industry(overall), the picture is not as rosy as it seems,'' Ferguson said.``If present earnings trends for these (443) banks continue, thisgroup will run out of capital by late 1990 or early 1991.''   The banking industry disputes its critics.   ``Skeptics make a living peddling a different tune,'' Nebraskabanker C.G. Holthus, president-elect of the American BankersAssociation, told a House subcommittee. ``We think they'reexaggerating the problem.''   By many measures, commercial banks, unlike savings and loans,are flourishing.   Banks earned a record six-month profit of $14.3 billion in thefirst half of 1989, on top of the record annual profit of $25.1billion last year. And their three most pressing problems have alleased:   _The nation's largest banks have added to their loss reserves,putting them in a better position to withstand a deterioration ofshaky Third World debtor nations to repay the banks' loans.   _The string of Midwestern bank failures has subsided with therecovery of the farm economy.   _The economies of Texas and other oil-producing states, wheremost of the failures are concentrated now, appear to have bottomedout.   Moreover, the savings and loan bailout bill passed this summernearly doubles the insurance premium paid by banks. That willprovide an added $1.5 billion a year to help the fund recover fromits first-ever loss in 1988.   ``Simply put, the condition of commercial banks is not a thriftcrisis in sheep's clothing,'' said James J. McDermott Jr. of Keefe,Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., an analyst who expresses more optimism thansome of his colleagues.   Replied Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., ``I'm not sure I'm reassured.... It's a little bit like saying the United States is better offthan Bangladesh.''   On the House side, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., has been voicingsimilar worries and last week asked Congress' auditing arm, theGeneral Accounting Office, to conduct a comprehensive study of thedeposit insurance fund and the condition of banking.   ``Although federal regulators paint a rosy picture of theindustry, certain industry experts cast doubt on this assessment. Iam deeply troubled over the concerns raised by these experts,'' hesaid in a letter requesting the study.   The analysts identify two areas as the likely causes of the nextbanking crisis: large banks' growing involvement in financingleveraged corporate buyouts and community banks' decision to followthrifts into real estate lending.   Bank real estate loans have soared 75 percent from $364 billionin 1984 to $636 billion in 1988, according to consultant AlexSheshunoff of Austin, Texas. Softening property values innortheastern states are particularly ominous.   ``Real estate lending has become the Achilles heel of banking,''he said. `` ... Some of the growth unfortunately financedspeculative excesses which will take time to absorb.''</TEXT></DOC>
