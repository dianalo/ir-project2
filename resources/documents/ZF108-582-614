(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PageMaker 4.0, DesignStudio, Xpress 3.0 and Ventura PublisherandM;THREE MONTHS AGO, we reviewed Aldus's new version of PageMaker and Letraset'snew DesignStudio offering.andP;  Since then, we have received a test version ofQuarkXpress 3.0, which we will review as soon as the final version is out.andO;With each of these products boasting a large number of new features andbroader application focus, we thought this would be a good time to prepare acomprehensive comparison of these market leaders to make it easier forprospective customers to sort out the differences.andP;  Because these programsare moving in the direction of the market for production of long documents,we have added Xerox's Ventura Publisher to the comparison.andP;  It still providesthe best facilities for creation of long documents, but other programs, suchas FrameMaker, are closing the gap.andM;Our intention isn't to provide a numerical evaluation that can be tallied andused to declare a winner.andP;  As will always be the case, the appropriateproduct for one job may not be the appropriate one for another.andP;  But becausethese programs have become quite sophisticated, we wanted to help to clarifywhere their various strengths--and weaknesses--are.andP;  We have prepared ourdata in the form of a comparison table listing the main features a desktoppublishing system should have and some details about how each productaddresses them.andM;But first, some explanatory notes, which follow the same basic structure asthe comparison charts.andP;  We'll start with hardware requirements and othersystem-related issues and then move on to editing features and composition.andO;From there, we'll tackle page design, style sheets, book pagination and asmall part of the graphics question.andM;System characteristicsandM;Software vendors usually print the hardware requirements for their programson the outer wrapping or in the documentation.andP;  Unless otherwise stated, wethink it is wise to assume that the configuration listed is the minimumrequired.andP;  Some software vendors apparently agree because they list twoconfigurations--minimum and recommended.andP;  The minimum is the one that willallow you to start or launch the program and do a little work.andP;  If your needsare greater, consider using the recommended configuration.andM;For serious work, we feel very strongly that you will want to have a monitorthat can display at least one full page at a time--two is even better.andP;  Acolor monitor is nice because most programs use color to distinguish guidelines, column boundaries, loose lines and so on; it is a requirement if youintend to design in color and use color in the finished document.andM;A mouse is a de facto necessity for all of these programs.andP;  You can run somePC-based desktop publishing programs without a mouse, moving around thescreen using the keyboard arrows, but you don't want to.andP;  Think of it thisway--you could also paint your house using a watercolor brush, but it's aterribly inefficient method.andM;Do you need a '286 or a '386, a Mac SE or a II?andP;  Or can you use your old XTor Mac Plus?andP;  This is mostly a speed consideration.andP;  Does your livelihooddepend on how you can get a job done or do you use the program occasionallyto save a little money on outside work?andM;There are some compatibility issues, though.andP;  By and large, all Macs (exceptthe very oldest, sub-megabyte models) are compatible with current programs,as long as they have enough memory installed.andP;  You might want to be wary ofthe very newest (ci and fx) machines, though; each new model seems to haveits own quirks and it can take a few months for software developers to figureout how to cope with them.andP;  In the PC arena, it is technically possible torun Ventura on an XT, but all Windows software (such as PageMaker) requires a'286 or better.andM;Hard disk space.andP;  Be aware that hard disk requirements can vary betweensingle-user and network versions.andP;  For example, Xerox recommends a bareminimum of 3 MB of space on a local hard disk for each single-userinstallation of Ventura.andP;  But a local hard disk is not required to runNetwork Ventura--though you do need plenty of space on the file server.andM;Memory.andP;  Mac memory sizing is pretty straightforward.andP;  Most publishingapplications have grown too big to run well in one megabyte, but by cuttingdown the size of your system file you might be able to print small documents.andO;Two megs is rapidly becoming the realistic minimum, and when Apple releasesSystem 7, it will be the official minimum as well.andM;On the PC side, PageMaker under Windows 2.0 can't see anything beyond the640K mark, but a RAM drive or (better) a disk cache will greatly improveperformance.andP;  Most users would consider PageMaker unbearably slow with only640K.andP;  With 1 MB or more, Windows 2.0 employs two memory managing devices:HIMEM.SYS (creates another 64K of conventional memory) and SMARTDRV.SYS (adisk cache of up to 2 MB).andP;  Because Windows 3.0 effectively breaks the 640Kbarrier, we expect that Windows applications will soon take advantage of asmuch memory as you care to buy.andM;Xerox says that you do not need expanded memory to run Ventura ProfessionalExtension, but it recommends it highly.andP;  How much expanded memory do youneed?andP;  Well, if you load the Edco hyphenation dictionary, you'll need atleast 1.5 MB.andP;  Beyond that, the bigger and more complex your document, themore memory you should have.andP;  We used 2 MB when reviewing Network Venturawith Professional Extension and PageMaker 3.0 for the PC.andM;Network features.andP;  There are two features a network version of any programmust have:andM;* Some way of preventing a user from writing to a file or part of a documentthat someone else is already using.andP;  Blanket file locking can be used and isoften provided automatically by the file server.andP;  But it can be cumbersome ifseveral people need to get to different parts of one large file, e.g.,andO;chapters in a book.andP;  What you really need is the ability to lock an arbitraryportion of a file, which the programmers call byte-range locking.andP;  Not allfile servers can do this (Novell, LAN Manager and AppleShare servers can),and even then, it is up to the application program to request the fmction.andO;What almost certainly won't work, in the long run, is to install single-usersoftware on everybody's workstation and tell them to &quot;share&quot; files via anetwork.andP;  You are just asking for trouble.andM;* Some way of restricting access to files.andP;  Either the applications softwareor the operating system must provide such protection.andP;  This can beaccomplished by assigning rights to users or groups of users or by usingpasswords.andP;  Controlling access is especially important if remote dial-in ispossible on the network.andM;Different levels of sophistication are possible and may be desirable,depending upon your company's needs.andP;  For example, you might want have thingsset up so that a writer cannot access files that he hasn't written or so thathe cannot alter edited files.andM;Operating system.andP;  You may have a network operating system you love, but thenetwork version of the desktop publishing program you want to buy may not runon your network operating system.andP;  Novell Netware is a commonly supportedoperating system, as is 3Com's 3-Plus.andP;  The OS/2 LAN Manager is expected tobe widely supported.andP;  Others, like Banyan's Vines and IBM's PC Net, are not.andM;Of the four programs we selected to review for this article, only VenturaPublisher has a network version.andP;  This is not because of the differenthardware platforms the programs use.andP;  It is a coincidence that Ventura runson a PC platform and the rest run on Macs.andP;  It is perfectly possible to writenetwork versions of Mac programs--we expect that the long-rumored Mac versionof Ventura will have network support--but so far no Mac vendors have chosento do so.andM;EditingandM;Most desktop publishers create text files in a word processor, then importthem into a page layout program.andP;  A word processor is usually more efficientat basic text operations because it was designed for them.andM;However, text often must be revised in the page layout program, which mustmake the process as quick and painless as possible.andP;  If that program's textediting features are powerful and friendly enough the user may even createthe text there; we know people who have written entire books using such aprogram.andP;  This approach is still unusual, but the reasons for balky textediting in a layout program are ever fewer.andM;Display.andP;  The user should be able to view and edit multiple pages at once.andP;  Avariety of display percentages should be offered so the user can zoom in orout as much as desired.andP;  Optionally displayable rulers are helpful in manyways.andM;Fast editing.andP;  All of these programs provide WYSIWYG displays, which haveobvious benefits but are notoriously slow because of the complex screenrepaintings.andP;  To speed operation, the user should be able either to edit in amonospaced window or to turn off automatic repainting in WYSIWYG mode.andP;  Atthe very least, the program should provide a typing buffer sufficient to holdany characters struck while the screen is repainting.andM;Safety precautions.andP;  A user who can undo the most recent one or (preferably)more editing operations is less likely to delete valuable text irrevocably.andO;Blocks of text should be lockable to prevent accidental or intentionaldamage.andP;  Finally, in case of mistakes or reconsiderations, the user should beable to revert easily to the most recently stored version of the file.andM;Keyboard functions.andP;  Programmable keys, to which multistep (macro) operationscan be assigned, speed repetitive operations.andP;  Many users will also workbetter if the keyboard can be configured to emulate their favorite wordprocessors.andM;Cursor and block operations.andP;  The user should be able to reach any point inthe document quickly.andP;  When the cursor reaches the end or beginning of aline, it should automatically move to the next or previous line.andP;  The usershould be able to jump quickly to any page in the document.andP;  Function keysshould offer movement forward or backward in increments of one word, line,sentence, paragraph, screen, page or entire file.andP;  There should also besimple ways to define any of those text portions, then delete, copy or movethem.andM;Commands.andP;  The more ways to specify parameters or give commands, the better.andO;A combination of easily accessible menus and key combinations is valuable;typed command codes are another possibility.andM;Search and replace.andP;  The user should be able to search not only for a stringof characters, but for any combination of characters, fonts, and text sizesor styles.andP;  Advanced routines can also search on leading, degree ofcompression or expansion, and (if the program supports it) text shading orfill pattern.andP;  Case-sensitive search and replace, which finds only acharacter string that matches the original's upper- and/or lower-case format,is a virtual necessity; it should give the option of replacing existing textwith characters either in a specific case or in the same case as the existingtext.andP;  (E.g., &quot;orange&quot; and &quot;Orange&quot; could both be changed to &quot;GREEN&quot; or couldbe made into &quot;green&quot; and &quot;Green.&quot;)andM;This routine should be able to work forward or backward from any specifiedpoint.andP;  It should be configurable so that the user can confirm or skip anymatch that is found.andM;Wildcard strings should also be supported, with the wildcard representingeither a single character or any string of characters.andP;  With the firstmethod, &quot;p[wildcard]nt&quot; would be matched by &quot;pint&quot; but not &quot;point&quot;; with thesecond method, it would be matched by both.andM;Spelling checker.andP;  A built-in spelling checker should be usable eitherinteractively (flagging errors as they are typed) or in batch mode (checkingall or part of the file at once).andP;  When a word is flagged, the user should beable to select a replacement from a list of close matches, add the flaggedword to the dictionary, have the program ignore it for the rest of thedocument, or just skip it.andP;  Users should be able to add words to the spellingdictionary and to create separate topic-specific or user-specificdictionaries.andP;  A thesaurus is also handy.andP;  (See also hyphenation dictionaryunder Composition.)andM;Import and export.andP;  The program should import text files from wordprocessors, with as much formatting (font, style, size, tab placement, etc.)andO;left intact as possible.andP;  It should also export formatted text to wordprocessors or to other layout programs.andP;  If a formatted file is exported forediting and corrections, all attributes that have been added at the pagecomposition workstation should remain valid.andM;CompositionandM;Type features.andP;  Every program should support unlimited numbers of fonts inany job (although the user is encouraged to apply some aesthetic judgment).andO;It is nice to be able to select a bold or italic version of the current fontwithout having to pull down the entire font menu.andM;The available size range should be great--from 4 or 5 points to 200 ormore--and available in increments of a minimum of one-quarter point.andP;  Itshould be possible to a change a character's width independently of itsheight to condense or expand type.andM;Vertical movement (line spacing or leading) should be offered in incrementsof one-quarter point.andP;  Additionally, &quot;baseline jumps&quot; should be possible tomove the baseline of a particular character or group of characters up 2 ordown 2 in the middle of a line.andM;Rotation of text is less crucial than the items listed above, but it is niceto have, preferably in one-degree increments.andP;  The system should enablerotation to be specified both by typing an exact number in a dialog box andby moving the element visually on the screen.andM;These programs all handle paragraph indents, hanging indents and left/rightindents.andP;  There are times when an indent on text, which alternatively mightbe called indent here, would be useful.andP;  This command initiates an indentexactly at the place it is called for within the text.andM;* This approach is used, for example, when a bullet or a number precedes thetext and the succeeding lines are to be aligned with the text on the firstline, rather than aligning with the bullet or number at the margin.andP;  Thecurrent means of producing this kind of indent with desktop systems is to usea tab ruler and attempt to calculate the exact point, not to base it on thelocation of a character on a text line.andM;Whether you call them dropped initials, dropped caps or big first letters,these characters are part of nearly every publishing program at every level.andO;But the capabilities are far from equal.andP;  The user should have control overthe font and size of the capital, the line on which it is placed and thespace between it and the regular-sized letters in the same paragraph.andM;We aren't impressed by programs that make you create a separate frame, put alarge character into it and create another frame for the rest of the text.andO;This is too much trouble and doesn't provide an easy means of changing thecharacter or adjusting the spacing with respect to the regular-sizedcharacters.andM;Text runarounds.andP;  Another form of indent is a text runaround, which isusually created by drawing a shape on the screen, although some systemsprovide complex commands to create shapes.andP;  Most systems can flow textautomatically around rectangular shapes, but it is nice to be able to createirregular shapes and have text flow around them, as is often the case withgraphic elements.andP;  There are several concerns with respect to irregularrunarounds:andM;1.andP;  How are they drawn?andP;  Perhaps the operator draws the shape by markingpoints to create a &quot;thread&quot; that serves as a boundary for text; but it isbetter if the system can automatically generate the shape based on the shapeof the graphic that is used.andM;2.andP;  The system should allow the operator to specify the &quot;gutter&quot; between thegraphic and text so that that distance can be changed for aesthetic or otherreasons without having to redraw the thread.andM;3.andP;  What happens if the irregular shape creates a line that is so short it isimpossible to flow text meaningfully into it?andP;  To prevent this, it is nice tobe able to specify a minimum length of line.andM;4.andP;  What happens if there are text areas on both sides of the irregularshape?andP;  Most programs permit text to flow on only one side of the shape(unless the text is formatted into multiple columns).andP;  This approach causeshuge gaps on the page.andP;  The solution is either to change the shape to avoidthese gaps or to have the text flow on both sides, which a few programs do.andO;Flowing text on both sides can be difficult to read, but it is much moreattractive visually than leaving empty space.andM;Justification algorithm.andP;  Over the years, we have written at great lengthabout the requirements of a justification algorithm, so we will onlysummarize our previous comments at this time.andP;  The main principle is that thesystem should attempt to break each line using the &quot;optimum&quot; (sometimescalled &quot;ideal&quot;) word space.andP;  The optimum value should be set so that it is,in fact, the most attractive spacing for the line--neither very tight (smallword spaces) nor very loose (large word spaces).andP;  This value, in turn,depends on font, type size and line length, so it must be user-settable.andP;  Ofcourse, most lines don't have a convenient break point that produces theoptimum value, so the system should look for a break point very close to theoptimum, if that is available.andP;  The break point could conceivably come oneither side of the optimum.andP;  This is, the word spaces might be smaller thanthe optimum value or they might be greater, depending on the circumstances ofthe particular line.andM;The user also should be able to set the minimum and maximum spaceband valuesthat may be used in justification to prevent lines that are too tight or tooloose.andM;Another useful feature in justification--especially when lines are short--isletterspacing, both positive and negative.andP;  Letterspacing is the loosening ortightening of space between characters to achieve a better break at the endof the line.andP;  If it is done in very fine increments, it can be unnoticeableto the reader, but still useful in justification.andP;  If it is done in largeamounts, it can be disastrous, as we often see in newspapers.andM;Some systems specify interword and intercharacter spacing values in relativeunits; others use a percentage of the ideal value defined by the fontsupplier.andP;  It doesn't really matter which method is used, provided theoperator can modify the values freely.andM;Hyphenation.andP;  One means of avoiding too loose or too tight lines, obviously,is to hyphenate words.andP;  The system should provide a hyphenation dictionaryand enable the user to add or change words, with a hyphenation algorithmavailable to break words that aren't in the dictionary.andP;  Things to checkabout the dictionary are how many words it contains (somewhere around 100,000words is a common size), how easy it is to update, whether it providespreferential points (for example, inter-national is better thaninterna-tional or in-ternational), and whether auxiliary dictionaries can beset up to cover specific applications (such as medical or legal words).andM;The operator should be able to specify the number of consecutive lines thatcan be hyphenated, the minimum length of word that can be hyphenated, theminimum number of characters that must precede and follow a hyphen,characters that can serve as line breaks without adding hyphens (slash,em-dash, en-dash, en space, em space, etc.), and whether either portion of acompound word can be hyphenated to break the line.andM;It is nice to be able to know which hyphens resulted from looking up the wordin the dictionary (in which case the break should be correct) and which onesresulted from logic (in which case they may be wrong and need closerproofreading).andP;  A discretionary hyphen must be available to change thelocation of a hyphen or to enable or prevent hyphenation of a word.andM;Another nice feature is the ability to look up words to find out how thesystem will break them.andM;After all of these factors are taken into consideration, there still may notbe a good break point, in which case the system generally expands interwordspacing as much as is needed to justify the line.andP;  However, these linesshould be flagged in some way by the system.andP;  Aldus has a nice means offlagging loose lines in PageMaker 4.0: it highlights the line with a gray orcolored background.andP;  It is also nice to be able to tell how loose the lineis, not only by the visual presentation on the screen, but also by a specificvalue--a feature none of these programs has.andM;All of these features--adjusting spacing and using hyphenation--are part ofthe process of finding line breaks during justification.andP;  It isn't enoughjust to have these features, however.andP;  It is important to see how they areimplemented.andP;  QuarkXpress, for example, intertwines letterspacing and wordspacing in such a way that it sometimes uses letterspacing when it isn'tdesirable.andP;  In other words, Xpress doesn't give the user full control overwhen additional word spacing is used and when letterspacing is applied.andP;  Weprefer to use the entire allowable word space (the maximum) before anyletterspacing is applied.andM;In addition to giving the user control over the degree of modification, it isnice to let the user specify the order in which these items are used.andP;  Thatis, how much may word space be expanded before letterspacing is used?andP;  Shouldhyphenation be attempted before letterspacing or after it?andP;  Different peoplehave different ideas on these questions, so the system should accommodatethem all.andM;Aesthetic features.andP;  Under this category fall items such as kerning, trackingand other means of adjusting spacing.andM;* Kerning.andP;  Although both pair kerning and sector kerning are found onhigh-quality commercial systems, at the desktop level, automatic kerningbased on character pairs is generally the method used.andP;  The questions to beasked about the kerning facility include how many pairs can be specified perfont, how many values are supplied by the vendor, whether the values can bechanged by the user (a necessity), the finest increment that can be applied(1/100 of an em or smaller), and how easily values can be changed.andO;(DesignStudio has a very nice means of changing kerning.)andM;Besides automatic kerning, it is imperative that the system support manualkerning, also in fine increments.andP;  Manual kerning can be applied either byspecifying a value or by &quot;bumping&quot; the value incrementally from the keyboard.andM;* Tracking.andP;  Although vendors define and implement tracking in differentways, we define it as automatic modification of intercharacter spacing astype sizes change.andP;  Tracking is required because spacing is designed to beideal at text sizes (9 or 10 points).andP;  In larger sizes, characters tend to bespaced too far apart.andP;  In small sizes (5 or 6 points), they tend to be tooclose together.andP;  Tracking is used to adjust them appropriately.andP;  It should bedone automatically, not requiring the operator to select the text and applyan adjustment.andP;  Different values are needed for different fonts because ofdifferences in their designs.andP;  Values should be modifiable by the user.andM;Systems generally support several tracks so that the user can pick the degreeof tightness appropriate for a particular application.andP;  Three or four tracksare commonly available.andP;  Tracking increments usually should be the same asfor kerning: 1/100 of an em or finer.andM;* Manual addition/reduction of character space.andP;  Besides automatic and manualkerning, which act only on character pairs, and the tracking feature justdescribed, which applies to an entire block of text, there should be a manualfeature for making adjustments in character spacing on a global basis.andP;  Theuser should be able to select a block of text or to embed a command and causethe intercharacter spacing to be changed positively or negatively.andP;  Thisdiffers from letterspacing in that it is done manually, generally foraesthetic reasons, whereas letterspacing is done to aid in finding a breakpoint for justification.andM;Special character access.andP;  In all types of work, there is a need to accessspecial characters or generate special characters from existing ones.andP;  In theformer category are foreign accents and characters such as the German doubles, while in the latter are fractions, small caps, and suband superscripts.andM;* Ligature generation.andP;  With many fonts, if an &quot;f&quot; is followed immediately byan &quot;i&quot; (fi), the dot on the &quot;i&quot; touches the top of the &quot;f&quot;, which isinappropriate.andP;  Most fonts have a ligature that should be substituted forthese two characters when they appear together.andP;  Often, though, theapplication software doesn't access the ligature automatically.andP;  Besides the&quot;fi&quot; pair, the most necessary ligature is &quot;fl.&quot;andM;If letterspacing is applied in large amounts, the ligature should be canceledautomatically, though no desktop program currently does this.andM;* Small caps.andP;  Small caps need to be supported, but in a fashion differentfrom the way many systems currently operate.andP;  A true small cap is designed tohave slightly greater width than height.andP;  For example, here are somedifferent ways of making small caps:andM;1.andP;  CAPS, SMALL CAPS, 90% of height, 90% of width.andM;2.andP;  CAPS, SMALL CAPS, 79% of height, 84% of width.andM;3.andP;  CAPS, SMALL CAPS, 74% of height, 80% of width.andM;4.andP;  CAPS, SMALL CAPS, 68% of height, 68% of width.andM;5.andP;  CAPS, SMALL CAPS, 68% of height, 75% of width.andM;6.andP;  CAPS, SMALL CAPS, 68% of height, 79% of width.andM;The best percentages may differ slightly from one font to another, but thereis no question about item 4.andP;  It looks awful.andP;  A good small cap needs to beslightly wider than its height with respect to the full-cap size.andM;* Fractions.andP;  Although most of these programs don't have facilities forhandling multilevel equations, they still should be able to generateaesthetic fractions (13/16)--in fact, a serious deficiency of most of them.andM;* Sub- and superscripts.andP;  Control over sub- and superscripts should includethe ability to specify the size of the characters to be created and thedistance they will appear from the baseline.andM;Ragged composition.andP;  As we have noted in previous articles, quadding everyline to the left doesn't usually make attractive text.andP;  Some lines will bevery long and some very short.andP;  Sometimes three or four consecutive lineswill be almost the same length, appearing to be carelessly justified text.andM;One solution to these problems is to have a ragged composition program thatcompares the current line with the length of the previous one and tries tomake it significantly different--perhaps shorter, perhaps longer.andP;  It isn'tenough merely to try to change the length of each line by resetting the linelength, as PageMaker does.andP;  That method leaves too much to chance.andM;The other part of a good algorithm is to give the program some means withwhich to achieve an aesthetic &quot;rag&quot; when the line doesn't provide a goodbreak point.andP;  Sometimes minute adjustments to word and character spacing canbe employed to make the line end more attractively.andP;  Of course, hyphenationalso can be used to find a better line break, although it generally is usedmore sparingly in ragged text than in justified text.andM;Tabular composition.andP;  A commercial composition system usually providesflexible, automated features for producing tabular material.andP;  Most desktopsystems haven't addressed this need seriously yet, although Ventura Publishercurrently offers a reasonable tabular program.andP;  One of the key questions ishow the program handles text that runs for more than one line.andP;  Does itautomatically find the appropriate location for text in other columns?andM;Other questions relate to ease in handling headings that straddle more thanone column (both horizontally and vertically), automatic generation of rulesand gutters, typographic characteristics that can be given to tab columns(quadding condition, size and font, etc.), alignment (such as aligningdecimal points), importing of spreadsheet data, inserting graphics withintable cells and splitting tables over more than one page.andM;Math.andP;  Among the products covered here, only Ventura Publisher has attemptedto deal with multilevel math, although a notch upmarket FrameMaker has acomprehensive math package that is easy to use.andM;Page designandM;Designing a page layout involves specifying the margins of the type page andthe layout blocks for body copy within the type page.andP;  In these programs,this process is accomplished through a combination of filling out a dialogbox and drawing layout blocks with a mouse with visual feedback on thescreen.andP;  The question is how intuitive and productive each program's methodis, and what extra features are offered to save time, aid precision or offerhelp.andM;Useful features include horizontal and vertical guides, which should becontrolled independently in fine increments of the user's preferred measuringunits.andP;  The guides often include the ability to snap drawn lines to theclosest line of the guide--in fact, the user should be able to specify howclose an element should be (in pixels) for it to snap.andM;Master pages.andP;  Many page designs call for elements that are common tomultiple pages: page numbers, running headers and footers, corporate logosand so on.andP;  The elements may be specified by laying out master pages whosecontent is copied to a range of document pages or by filling out a dialog toposition headers and footers.andP;  The questions to ask are: How easy is it toset up left and right pages?andP;  Can the first page of a chapter have adifferent design?andP;  Can you override the master design (for example, tosuppress a header) for a specific page?andM;Page templates save time in building new designs.andP;  The more there are, thebetter the chance that one will resemble the document you're about to design.andO;Frequently, page templates will be supplied as part of document templates.andM;Style sheetsandM;A style is a named collection of type properties that may be applied to aparagraph or, in some programs, a selected range of text.andP;  It covers formatdecisions such as font, point size, leading, paragraph style and other typecharacteristics applied at the paragraph level.andP;  A style sheet is acollection of the different styles used in a publication.andP;  The preferredmethod of handling style sheets is to map the names of the styles to genericidentifiers in the text file--that way, you can manipulate text and formatindependent of each other, and you can reformat an entire document simply byapplying a new style sheet.andM;Each of these programs differs in its approach to style sheets.andP;  They alsodiffer in the settings including in a style and in their ability to importand export tagged files.andP;  In operation, the way in which styles are editedalso differs.andP;  For example, we would note that it is sometimes preferable tohave the option of viewing all styles in a single, editable text file.andP;  Noneof these programs offers this feature; there are third-party products forVentura Publisher that display or print all the tag definitions in a stylefile, but they don't let you edit the tags.andM;The user must have some way of overriding styles; otherwise, a style must becreated for every contingency in the document.andM;PaginationandM;In this comparison, we take as a given the ability of the composition programto compose a text file and generate as many pages as is necessary to flow thecomplete article.andP;  The key issues are what controls are provided foradjusting the automatic flow process and what tools are offered forinteractively overriding the program's illustration placement and column andpage break decisions.andM;Number of pages.andP;  The maximum number of pages in a document used to be quitelimited for desktop programs.andP;  Today, the total is more generous, and someoffer the ability to link several files into one publication.andM;Book pagination control.andP;  The degree to which the program can automaticallymake aesthetically pleasing column breaks depends to a large degree on whereit will make spacing adjustments when breaks are at undesirable locations.andP;  Agood pagination program allows the user to specify both constraints (thingsto disallow) and flexibility (where to make compensation adjustments) beforepaginating a document.andP;  A basic requirement for two-column book work is theability to balance columns before a straddle head.andM;All of these programs support widow and orphan control.andP;  A &quot;widow&quot; used tomean a single word of less than a designated number of characters or the endof a hyphenated word by itself comprising the last line of a paragraph, or tothe less finicky, such a line at the top of a column.andP;  Over the years,though, widow control has come to mean the number of lines at the end of aparagraph required at the top of a column.andP;  Similarly, orphan control meansbeing able to set the number of lines required at the bottom of a column.andM;Preferably, widow/orphan control is set individually for each style in thestyle sheet.andP;  It is not enough to say no or yes to widows and orphans: youmay want free-hanging headings to be followed by at least four lines at thebottom of a column but run-in heads to require only two.andP;  Also, widows andorphans should be set independently, unless the system will keep the next orprevious paragraph with a style.andM;Adding constraints is not difficult.andP;  The hard part is making spacingadjustments to avoid widows, orphans and other bad breaks.andP;  A few high-endpagination systems ask the user to complete a try table, which rankspreferences for making spacing adjustments around illustrations, tables,footnotes or headings and between paragraphs.andP;  Some other systems willactually rejustify a range of paragraphs with different word spacing values,trading good line breaks for good page breaks according to user-setpreferences.andP;  No desktop program is quite this sophisticated.andP;  Instead, somesupport vertical justification of columns.andP;  This should be variable forstyles.andP;  For example, in Ventura, you specify the amount of space that may beadded or subtracted around a style element in order to justify columnsvertically.andP;  In QuarkXpress, vertical justification means increasing theleading of each line in a column (feathering), a feature best used sparingly,if at all.andM;Counters and markers.andP;  Some of the programs offer counters for automaticnumbering of elements within a document.andP;  The style of numbering should beflexible and the means of entering, finding and manipulating the countersstraightforward.andP;  Typically, the programs that offer automatic numbering doso in a fashion that allows it to be applied to virtually any element.andM;Automatic cross-references are markers embedded in the text that refer tosystem-identified elements of the document.andP;  The reference marker is expandedwhen the document is composed (for screen or printer output).andP;  It will thenautomatically change to reflect changes to its reference (whether it be atable number or a page number).andM;Automatic footnotes are highly desirable for anyone who frequently usesfootnotes; of the desktop programs, only Ventura has this feature.andM;Floating, fixed illustrations.andP;  The ability to float illustrative material todifferent locations on a page is essential for quality automatic paginationof two-column documents.andP;  Of these programs, only Ventura has this feature.andO;The others let you manually place illustrations at a fixed location on thepage, and all but DesignStudio allow the graphic to be placed in-line as ifit were a text character.andM;Link multiple files.andP;  Long documents are often easier to handle as a group ofchapters or sections that are linked into one publication.andP;  If the programsupports automatic folios and generation of contents and lists, it should beable to do it for multiple files linked as one publication.andP;  You should beable to set the style of such generated lists independent of their content.andO;The same is true for generating indexes, but indexes have the additionalrequirement of needing editing and cross-references.andP;  Of these programs, onlyPageMaker 4.0 offers an intermediate index list that may be edited.andM;Freeze pagination.andP;  When making changes to long documents, it is often usefulto turn off the automatic flow of text from page to page.andP;  For one thing, itoften improves performance.andP;  This ability to &quot;freeze pagination&quot; is essentialto doing looseleaf revisions (also called &quot;A-pages&quot; because the overflow frompage 26 goes onto page 26A) to published documents.andM;Newspaper pagination.andP;  All of these programs allow multiple text streamswithin a single document--the primary characteristic of newspaper-stylepagination.andP;  Some will insert automatic continued lines for stories that jumpfrom one page to another.andP;  Of greater concern is how many users can accessthe separate text streams at one time.andP;  At present, Ventura and PageMakerallow multiple authors to access separate streams while the page is open, butthey do not prevent (nor even warn the user against) editing changes to thesame stream at the same time in different places.andP;  Xpress locks all usersexcept one from the entire linked section of pages, preventing efficientlayout and editing of that section by multiple users.andM;GraphicsandM;Page layout programs aren't supposed to be all-purpose drawing and paintingprograms, but it is handy to be able to draw rules and boxes on the page.andO;Other shapes--ovals, polygons, freehand-drawn lines, Bezier curves--areuseful in particular cases, especially when an imported graphic or a scannedimage can be cropped and bordered by such shapes, or where text can runaround such shapes.andM;A good program provides a variety of line thicknesses and can draw the lineeither solid or with a pattern (dotted, dashed, etc.).andP;  It also providesmultiline rules, such as the traditional Scotch rule with one thick and onethin line.andP;  It should be possible to fill a closed shape with a tint orpattern.andM;Images.andP;  The sine qua non of a desktop publishing program is its ability tointegrate text and images from a wide variety of sources.andP;  On both the PC andthe Macintosh, there are a few standard graphic file formats that allpublishing programs support:andM;* Object formats: On the Mac, the universal object format is PICT (and thenewer PICT2 which supports color and objects larger than 32K bytes); manyprograms also can read MacDraw's native format.andP;  On the PC, there are morestandards, but the Windows GDI Metafile is close to being universal forpublishing programs.andM;* Image formats: Nearly all grayscale scanners write their data in a TaggedImage File Format.andP;  The original TIFF specification supported 8-bitmonochrome images.andP;  TIFF is an extensible standard, though, and newvariations are constantly being introduced; the most recent additions support24-bit color images.andP;  If you plan to use a color scanner, check whichversions of TIFF the software can handle.andM;* Paint formats: A fair number of paint programs are on the market, each withits own file format.andP;  Fortunately, nearly all Mac paint programs can read andwrite the original MacPaint format; nearly all PC programs can handle the PCXformat.andM;Color.andP;  The difference between spot color and process color is this: processcolor printing renders a range of colors by overlaying transparent inks offour specific hues--cyan, magenta, yellow and black.andP;  In contrast, spot colorcan be printed with any color of ink you like, and the ink can be transparentor opaque; the press is filled with the specified shade of ink at the timethe job is printed.andM;Process printing can produce only a limited gamut of colors.andP;  Not only arethere compromises in the choices of the ink pigments (the blue for sky isn'tquite the right shade to give good green grass), but there really is no suchthing as perfect ink.andM;Comparing Quality:andM;Default SettingsandM;We used this passage--from John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address--to comparethe composition routines of these four programs using two different linemeasures.andP;  The samples on this page were composed using the program's defaultsettings.andP;  In other words, for operators who don't know how to reset theparameters or don't take the trouble to change them, these would be theresults.andM;In the narrow measure work (top), note that PageMaker sets the job verytight--with very little wordspace on some lines.andP;  DesignStudio doesn't set itquite so tight, but this results in some very loose and unattractive lines.andO;Xpress produces undoubtedly the worst results because of its propensity forletterspacing.andP;  As should be obvious from the other samples, there is no needfor significant letterspacing in this text.andP;  Note in Ventura's output thatletterspacing is used, but in a restrained way.andM;In the wide measure sample (left), all of the output is too tight, withPageMaker the worst offender and Xpress producing the best results.andO;DesignStudio and Ventura are similar, but Letraset gets the edge by beingless tight.andM;Comparing Quality:andM;Seybold SettingsandM;This is the same passage as on page 11, but here we have based the word- andletterspacing settings on the ones that we use on our typesetting system toproduce this Report.andP;  On page 13, we have reproduced this same sample usingour Bestinfo system to show the results that we get--not necessarily theideal results, but adequate for most jobs.andM;The parameters are as follows: minimum wordspace, 85% of the valuerecommended by Adobe; optimum, 120%; maximum, 250%; letterspacing permittedonly to 4% of the Adobe width value.andM;We set each of these programs' parameters to those values.andP;  However, theresults differ because, inevitably, the algorithms act slightly differentlywhen it comes to working around the optimum wordspace.andM;In the narrow measure, note that PageMaker comes out exactly the way oursystem does (see page 13), and that Ventura is very close.andP;  DesignStudiovaries, though, and produces some very loose lines.andP;  Xpress varies the firstline, making it difficult to compare the programs, but it still produces muchbetter results with our setup than it does with its own default (see page11).andM;In the wide measure, the samples from Ventura and DesignStudio are identicalto the Seybold system's, but PageMaker's output varies slightly and Xpress'sis considerably tighter.andP;  All of them are far more attractive using oursettings than they are using their own.andM;The lessons from this exercise are many, but one obvious one is that it isimportant to set the program differently for different column measures.andO;Perhaps the software developers should find a way to change their defaultsautomatically as the column width changes.andM;Comparing Quality:andM;Ragged SettingsandM;In these samples, we attempted to use each program to produce the best raggedcomposition it is capable of producing.andP;  On earlier pages of this article, wehave explained how these programs handle ragged text, so we won't go intothat here.andP;  But we will comment on the results.andM;None of these programs has the flexibility to produce truly aesthetic raggedtype.andP;  DesignStudio achieves the most &quot;rag,&quot; but the first few lines don'tvary enough and the rest of the sample varies too much and too regularly.andO;Xpress and Ventura have too many consecutive lines that are nearly the samelength--very little rag.andP;  PageMaker produces some rag, but the user haslittle control over it.andM;Aldus PageMaker 4.0andM;OverviewandM;The easiest of the four programs to learn and the most widely used forgeneral-purpose document layout and composition;
