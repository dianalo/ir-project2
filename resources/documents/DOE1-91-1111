Lanthana and ceria were found to have ratiosof total surface area to LTOC similar to those of chromia and molybdenarespectively, after a comparable pretreatment. Furthermore, ceria isdeduced to exist as a monolayer on the alumina support at loadings below12%. An additional hour of reduction after the 6 hours of reduction showsa significant increase in LTOC on lanthana, neodymia and terbia whichmay be due to phase changes exhibited by these polymorphic oxides. Thekinetics of the water-gas shift reaction has been extensively studiedon iron oxide (high temperature shift) and copper oxide (low temperatureshift) based catalysts. This investigation establishes the kinetics overa sulfided cobalt-molybdena-alumina (AMOCAT 1A) catalyst in the mediumtemperature shift range, 250-300{sup 0}C. The catalyst was sulfided in-situin a high pressure integrated Berty reactor system. Reaction rates weremeasured for different CO/H{sub 2}O feed ratios in the range 0.3-3.0,with and without CO{sub 2} in the feed. The reaction was carried outat several pressures in the range 5-27 atm. and GHSV's in the range 4800-2400hr{sup 1}.</TEXT></DOC>
