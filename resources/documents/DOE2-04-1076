Thefour hyperfine lines of this state exhibit intensity ratios in absorptionwhich are consistent with a large optical depth. However, it is shownthat the effects of trapping of the interlocking and overlapping far-IRhyperfine lines at 560 microns which connect the ground and first excitedrotational states can also explain the observed hyperfine intensity ratiosat 42 cm. Collisions dominate the excitation of the first excited rotationstate. A column density of 6(15)/sq cm is derived for the CH toward W51,more than 10 times higher than previous estimates, yielding a fractionalabundance of about 2(-8) over a region of mean density about 2(4)/cucm. Shock chemistry is implied for CH in such regions, of which severalare now known. 36 references.</TEXT></DOC>
