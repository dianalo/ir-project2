But he was told that forgiveness carries a high price.    U.S. officials are telling Mr. Tamura, who arrived here Monday night, that Japan should strengthen its export-screening bureaucracy, expand its contributions to a Paris-based international organization that coordinates multilateral export controls, and toughen its laws against diversions of militarily sensitive technologies to the Soviet bloc.    Mr. Tamura has promised to augment his own export-control staff, but other Japanese officials privately admit that delivering the rest of the U.S. wish list would be politically difficult. There's strong resistance in Tokyo to Japan playing more than a token role in the Paris-based Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom. There's even more opposition back home to U.S. urgings that Japan reenact an espionage law to prevent technology diversions.    As a result, Reagan administration aides aren't prepared to let Toshiba and Japan off the hook until they hear a clearer set of commitments from Mr. Tamura. The Pentagon is holding up a decision to let the Japanese firm bid for a large order of laptop computers, while the Commerce Department is temporarily denying Toshiba blanket rights to import sensitive products from the U.S.    Moreover, even if Tokyo agrees to the administration's requests, it's unlikely that Toshiba can escape entirely some form of U.S. sanctions imposed by Congress. The overwhelming 92-5 Senate vote for a ban of two to five years on most Toshiba products makes it nearly impossible for the U.S. to drop all sanctions. The House is expected to follow the Senate's lead.    Administration members officially oppose anti-Toshiba sanctions, but privately they are just as angry as the members of Congress and are loath to spend political capital fighting the sanctions. However, positive action by Japan and Toshiba to strengthen controls on sensitive technology might induce the president to use his authority under the pending law to narrow or limit the sanctions. The administration will urge Congress to maximize that presidential discretion.    Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, for one, won't be &quot;particularly bending or indulgent&quot; to Mr. Tamura because the furor over the Toshiba diversion came right on the heels of a still-unsettled dispute over Japan's semiconductor trade practices, a Baldrige aide said. Mr. Tamura is scheduled to call on Mr. Baldrige today.    Japan's meager $40,000 annual contribution to Cocom has irked the U.S. for years. Richard Perle, the former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy, has complained about Japan's &quot;disingenuousness&quot; in claiming that it doesn't have enough funds to pay more than a small fraction of the organization's administrative budget.    Many current U.S. officials agree. &quot;If Cocom contributions were assessed on the basis of trade volume, Japan should pay $1 million instead of $40,000 a year,&quot; a Commerce Department aide said. Japan can afford a generous contribution, but it's wary about being dragged deeper into the superpower conflicts that gave birth to Cocom.    State Department aides acknowledge that the U.S. would be happy to see Japan reestablish a law punishing espionage activities. Japan is practically the only U.S. ally without such a law. A pre-war espionage law was allowed to lapse during the postwar U.S. occupation. Japan's mass media and opposition parties fear that the reestablishment of such a law could encourage the revival of attacks against civil liberties.    Yesterday, Mr. Tamura met with Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Rep. Don Bonker (D., Wash.), chairman of the House subcommittee on international economic policy and trade. He is scheduled to meet tomorrow with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Sen. Bentsen is managing action on the Senate trade bill, which could have a huge impact on U.S.-Japan trade.    Meanwhile, in another action prompted by the Toshiba sale to the Soviet Union, the Senate last night approved, by voice vote, a trade-bill amendment that would direct the Commerce Department to require foreign companies in Cocom countries that don't have adequate controls to obtain U.S. re-export licenses before shipping American-origin products to third countries. </TEXT></DOC>
