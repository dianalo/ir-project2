The courts said this violated the First Amendment. The government-subsidized broadcasters wanted to reward the Senator for his proposed trust fund for public TV. The trust would be built from a new tax on ownership transfers of private stations. Public television, which likes to do shows on the U.S. Constitution, might want to explore the Fifth Amendment: &quot;nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
