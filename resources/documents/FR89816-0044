A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906). Crop Genetics International, of Hanover, Maryland, has submitted an applicationfor a permit for release into the environment, to field test the bacterium<T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis</T3>, genetically engineered to express the delta-endotoxingene of <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis </T3>var. <T3>kurstaki </T3>in rice. The field trial will take place in Queen AnnesCounty, Maryland. In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>bacterium under the conditions described in the CropGenetics International application. APHIS concluded that the field testwill not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination andwill not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Crop Genetics International, as well asa review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing. The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. The delta-endotoxin gene from <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis </T3>was inserted into the <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>genome. The gene is lost from the bacterium at therate of once in every 12,500 bacterial cells per generation <T3>in vitro</T3>. Both the revertant (which has lost the delta-endotoxingene) and the naturally occurring bacterial strains grow faster (14 percentgrowth rate differential in laboratory medium) than the recombinant bacterium.In the field, using corn, revertant bacteria can make up to 6 percent ofthe population of the bacterium, depending on the plant part, by the endof the growing season. Thus, the delta-endotoxin gene will eventually belost from the recombinant bacterium. 2. The genetic alterations are not expected to enhance any plant pathogenicproperty of the recombinant bacterium as compared to the parental strainof <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>that is already present in the State of Maryland wherethe test plot is located. 3. Although <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>is transferred by mechanical means; e.g., cutting tools,to other plants, it is not transferred easily by other mechanisms in thefield. Transfer to other plants by mechanical transfer will be minimizedin the field plot designs and field plot protocols, which include bufferzones and tool disinfestation. The bacterium does not appear to proliferateoutside the host plant. In addition, regular monitoring for the recombinantbacterium will ensure that if it spreads to plants at the edge of the testplots, it will be detected. 4. Dissimination of <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>does not occur in rice seed, although it has been shownto occur in corn. However, all seed not used for research purposes (incontainment) will be destroyed, preventing transfer by this mechanism.5. Data have been provided by the company to demonstrate that the probabilityof transfer of the delta-endotoxin gene from the recombinant bacteriumto other micro-organisms is extremely remote. 6. The recombinant bacterium has a relatively low order of toxicity tosusceptible insects. The field test plot is very small. Therefore, theintroduction of the recombinant bacterium poses no significant impact onsusceptible insect populations. 7. There were no listed (January 1, 1989, 50 CFR 17.11 and 17.12) threatenedor endangered insect species present in the test site in Maryland, so theintroduction of the recombinant bacterium poses no risk to these threatenedinsects. 8. The inherent properties of <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>and the recombinant bacterium indicate that there areno human health risks. The bacterium does nt grow at human body temperature.The bacterium has been shown not to be pathogenic or toxic in mammaliantests. In addition, all crops will be used for research purposes or destroyedso that there will be no dietary exposure to humans. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq</T3>.), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 11th day of August 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
