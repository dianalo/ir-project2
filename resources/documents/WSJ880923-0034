Right now, the 32-year-old Mr. Nishida is a front-line soldier in the central bank's struggle to rein in the currency markets. He's one of nine currency traders at the Bank of Japan's cluttered, second-floor trading desk in downtown Tokyo. It's a grueling job; Mr. Nishida starts watching the markets when he wakes at 6 a.m. and often doesn't finish work until 11 p.m.    The past year, Mr. Nishida's trades often haven't been the least bit profitable. But that's part of his mission.    Of all central banks, the Bank of Japan has battled currency speculators the hardest. By some estimates, it bought more than $50 billion of dollars in the two years ended March 31, 1988, even though the dollar kept falling in value. With only limited success, Mr. Nishida and his colleagues were selling valuable yen in hopes of braking the dollar's fall.    A shy, conservatively dressed man, Mr. Nishida never set out to be a big-time currency trader. He was an English major at Sophia University in Japan, unlike most Bank of Japan employees, who studied law or economics at prestigious Tokyo University. When Mr. Nishida joined the central bank, he headed into the more tranquil research department. That job let him hone his English for a year at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.    But the Bank of Japan's tradition is to rotate employees through a wide range of departments. That's a big contrast with, say, the U.S. or West German central banks, which prefer to have lifetime currency dealers. So in June 1987, Mr. Nishida's turn came up.    Trading currencies &quot;is just one step in one's overall career at the bank,&quot; says Zenta Nakajima, head of the foreign-exchange division at the Bank of Japan. &quot;We don't train {dealers}. They've got to pick up expertise while they're here.&quot;    Mr. Nishida took quickly to his new setting. &quot;This is the only place in the bank where you can get a real sense of market activities,&quot; he says. Upon awakening on a typical day, Mr. Nishida scans the newspapers and television for news of overnight markets and heads for the office. Before an 8 a.m. meeting, he reads the overnight messages from central banks around the world and phones dealers at Japanese and foreign banks in Tokyo.    Mr. Nishida won't talk about his trades, but central-bank dealers often trade in $10 million or bigger chunks. On a busy day, they can pound the market with as much as $500 million or $1 billion of total buying or selling. An advantage of working for a central bank, as opposed to a private bank, is that dealers don't have to worry about turning a profit.    &quot;The important thing for central bankers is to be able to part with dollars or yen and not look back,&quot; says Richard Koo, senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute. &quot;Their strength in the market comes from the fact that they can toss dollars and yen and not suffer losses.&quot; Other traders &quot;fear those who have nothing to lose,&quot; Mr. Koo adds.    Recent market conditions suggest that the Bank of Japan's dollar-buying binge has earned some vindication. Exchange-rate stability of a sort has been achieved, and the Japanese economy is growing briskly with little threat of inflation.    As for Mr. Nishida, he says he faces plenty of stress but survives by always trying to look ahead. &quot;I don't continue to be sorry for things already done,&quot; he says. &quot;We may make some mistakes. But my motto is to forget about what isn't necessary.&quot;    ---   Ms. Graven is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Tokyo bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
