Trades by at least five persons are being examined in the investigation, which the SEC's New York office began in mid-1987. Four of the traders are members of the New York Commodities Exchange, and Wall Street sources said they only dabble in stocks. The classmates' case may overlap several widely publicized insider-trading investigations, including probes of the so-called &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; trading ring and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said people familiar with those investigations.    Much of the trading under investigation in the classmates' probe took place in 1986 and 1987 and was channeled through a small discount brokerage, Andrew Peck Associates Inc. As reported last summer, the SEC has subpoenaed customer records at Peck. Federal investigators also are examining whether Peck employees may have emulated any improper trading for their own or the firm's account, people familiar with the investigation said.    The identities of the five traders under investigation were reported yesterday by the Washington Post. They are:   --Jeffrey Schwarz, a 1981 Penn graduate and a former partner at the arbitrage firm of Kellner DiLeo andamp; Co., whom friends say now runs his own trading firm.    --Mark Dickstein, a 1980 graduate described as a silver trader with his own trading firm, Dickstein andamp; Co.    --Craig Effron, a 1981 graduate and gold-trading specialist who also runs his own business.    --Curtis Schenker, a 1980 Penn graduate and commodities trader.    --Chris Engel, a 1981 graduate who also is a commodities trader.    None of the five men returned phone calls to their offices.    A spokeswoman for the New York Commodities Exchange said Messrs. Dickstein, Effron, Schenker and Engel hold seats there. A spokeswoman for the New York Mercantile Exchange said Messrs. Dickstein and Effron are members.    A Wall Street executive who knows some of the five described them as &quot;quintessential yuppies; these guys come right out of novels like 'Bonfire of the Vanities' and 'People Like Us.' They were real high livers.&quot;    A Wall Street friend of all five said Mr. Schwarz is the most serious stock trader of the group. &quot;Most of the stuff these guys traded on was gossip,&quot; the friend said. &quot;These guys are basically commodities traders who have dabbled in stocks.&quot;    Mr. Schwarz told a Wall Street Journal reporter in June that the SEC had obtained the records of calls made from his home telephone. He also confirmed that he had talked periodically with Robert Salsbury, a former Drexel arbitrager convicted as a member of the Yuppie Five ring. Mr. Salsbury received a degree from Penn in 1981, and at one time the two men lived in the same Manhattan building. Although SEC investigators have interviewed Mr. Salsbury, it's not clear what role if any he played in events being examined in the current probe.    SEC attorneys also are understood to be examining a possible role in the classmates' trading by Bruce Newberg, a former Drexel trader and 1980 Penn graduate who is under indictment in a securities fraud case involving Princeton/Newport Partners. Mr. Newberg was a senior trader in Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., operation run by Michael Milken. Mr. Milken was named in a civil securities-fraud suit filed by the SEC last September, and is under criminal investigation by the government for insider trading. Mr. Milken has said he is innocent of any wrongdoing.    Gerald Lefcourt, an attorney for Mr. Newberg, denied that his client was under investigation in the classmates probe. &quot;There's no such probe that I know of,&quot; Mr. Lefcourt said. &quot;We haven't been asked anything. This is the first we've heard of it.&quot;    Julian Friedman, an attorney for Mr. Schwarz, denied that Mr. Schwarz engaged in any wrongdoing &quot;in connection with Andrew Peck, Bruce Newberg, Robert Salsbury or trading in any other securities.&quot;    In the June interview, Mr. Schwarz said he had encouraged his college friends to trade through the Peck firm. &quot;I would probably know 10 people who trade at Peck. . . . We all went to school together, we were all friendly,&quot; Mr. Schwarz said. &quot;I know I told a number of friends these guys (at Peck) were good at execution. I know at least half a dozen people I told to open accounts there.&quot;    Gene R. McHam, Peck's president, declined to discuss the SEC investigation or allegations that Peck employees may have copied any improper trades. &quot;We do not fuel unsubstantiated stories by making any comment to any source whatsoever,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
