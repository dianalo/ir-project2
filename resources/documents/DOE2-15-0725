<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0725 </DOCNO><TEXT>X-ray absorption edge and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)spectra are reported for the Cu(I) and Cu(II) forms of bovine dopamine{beta}-hydroxylase and for the Cu(I) form of DBH bound either to tyraminesubstrate or to a multisubstrate inhibitor. A significant change in thestructure of the copper sites occurs upon ascorbate-mediated reductionof Cu(II) DBH to the Cu(I) form. While the average Cu(II) site most likelyconsists of a square-planar array of four (N,O)-containing ligands at1.98 A, the average Cu(I) site shows a reduction in (N,O) coordinationnumber (from {similar_to} 4 to {similar_to} 2) and the addition of aS-containing ligand at 2.30 A. No change in the average Cu(I) ligandenvironment accompanies binding of tyramine substrate, whereas bindingof a multisubstrate inhibitor, 1-(3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzyl)-1H-imidazole-2(3H)-thione,causes an increase in the Cu-S coordination, consistent with inhibitorbinding to the Cu(I) site through the S atom. Although excellent signal-to-noiseratio in the EXAFS spectra of ascorbate-reduced DBH facilitated analysisof outer-shell scattering for a Cu...Cu interaction, the presence ofa binuclear site could not be proven or disproven due to interferencefrom Cu...C scattering involving the carbons of imidazole ligands.</TEXT></DOC>
