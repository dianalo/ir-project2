Emery Jr., chairman of Emery Air Freight Corp., says he had a &quot;friendly&quot; telephone conversation yesterday with Nicholas F. Brady, chairman of Purolator Courier Corp.    &quot;I told him,&quot; says Mr. Emery, &quot;'Hey, Nick, this is the friendliest offer that you're going to get.'&quot; But Mr. Emery's &quot;friendly&quot; $40-a-share cash bid for 83% of Purolator's common shares -- an offer that totals about $310 million -- amounts to a hostile takeover attempt.    Purolator, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., had already agreed to a leveraged buyout for $35 a share in cash and securities by a group of Purolator executives and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc., a subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc. The offer would have expired at 12:01 a.m. EST today. But in response to Wilton, Conn.-based Emery's surprising takeover bid, the Purolator-Hutton offer was extended yesterday until Monday.    Mr. Emery, 62 years old, the white-haired, feisty son of Emery's founder, says he is confident he will prevail. The price Emery is offering, he says, &quot;is the biggest price we can afford.&quot; Some securities analysts say the price was too high. But Mr. Emery calls it &quot;a pre-emptive bid, designed to keep from nickeling and diming this thing back and forth.&quot;    Mr. Emery says he had been looking at a number of &quot;strategic options&quot; to bolster Emery's weakness in the lucrative small-package courier business. The company dominates the heavy-freight end already. &quot;We're the only act in town who can pick up a jet engine that weighs 2,000 pounds in Albany, N.Y., and deliver it to El Paso, Texas, by 10:30 the next morning,&quot; he brags. But he says Emery has been unable to expand the small-package business by selling it to existing customers.    In 1986, Emery had a net loss of $5.4 million on revenue of $887.5 million. &quot;Emery just needs to be larger because size is important in this industry,&quot; says Harlan Sonderling, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.    Mr. Emery figures that the Purolator acquisition would give Emery about 10% to 12% of the market in small packages. It now has only 4%. &quot;We'd be right behind Federal Express and United Parcel Service, and bypass Airborne,&quot; he says.    So last year, he says, he proposed to Purolator an &quot;arrangement to hitchhike Purolator's small-package business on our airplanes.&quot; He thought Purolator's small packages would help fill empty space on Emery's 71 planes. &quot;We have two million pounds of cargo a day and we could tuck (Purolator's) 400,000 pounds of air-courier business inside our existing aircraft,&quot; he said.    But Purolator's management rejected the idea, Mr. Emery says, because &quot;they liked having their own name on the airplane.&quot;    Emery has conditioned its takeover on receipt of the $166 million in cash that Purolator is to get from the pending sale of its Canadian courier business to Onex Capital Ltd. Mr. Emery plans to sell Purolator's auto parts division, which he values at about $50 million. And he also plans to sell or lease Purolator's air hub in Indianapolis, still under construction, because it would duplicate Emery's existing hub in Dayton, Ohio.    &quot;We're getting a $450 million business for $175 million,&quot; he says.    Securities analysts generally think the companies would make a good fit -- &quot;perfect,&quot; says Douglas M. Arthur, of Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. But &quot;Emery doesn't get away scot-free,&quot; says Andrew B. Kim, an analyst at F. Eberstadt Fleming Inc., adding that Emery's debt would &quot;triple to $300 million from $100 million.&quot;    Mr. Emery sees other efficiencies in an Emery-Purolator merger. With Purolator's 4,500 trucks, he says, he could slash to about 10 cents a pound from 60 cents a pound Emery's cost of short hauls, deliveries in a 500-mile radius.    He says the Purolator-Hutton leveraged buyout proposal rekindled his interest in Purolator. The prospectus for that proposal forecast a turnaround at Purolator -- a $16 million operating profit in 1987 against a $73 million operating loss in 1986. Still, some securities analysts view the prospect skeptically. &quot;Emery shouldn't bank on Purolator's forecast of a big earnings turnaround,&quot; one says.    Mr. Emery says he wants to keep the Purolator name and management. &quot;Purolator is a Tiffany-quality version of UPS,&quot; he says, &quot;and we can take advantage of what they have created.&quot;    Mr. Emery's father, John C. Emery Sr., founded Emery in 1946, the same year Mr. Emery joined the company as a truck driver and began his rise through the ranks. His father had been a World War II Navy transportation commander.    ---   Bid for Purolator Extended   NEW YORK -- A group proposing a leveraged buyout of Purolator Courier Corp. extended the expiration date of its offer while discussions began between Purolator and another suitor that made a higher bid.    E.F. Hutton LBO Inc., whose subsidiary, PC Acquisitions Inc., earlier proposed a leveraged buyout of Purolator for $35 a share, extended the expiration date of the $268 million offer to 12:01 a.m. EDT Tuesday. The bid, which had been accepted by Purolator's board, was scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST today.    Separately, Emery Air Freight Corp. launched a tender offer of $40 a share, or $306 million, for Purolator, a Basking Ridge, N.J.-based package delivery and auto parts concern. Emery is a Wilton, Conn.-based air cargo transportation company.    An Emery official said John C. Emery Jr., Emery's chairman, met yesterday with Nicholas F. Brady, Purolator's chairman, to discuss Emery's offer. The Emery official described the meeting as &quot;very cordial.&quot; Purolator officials declined to comment on Emery's offer or on the extension of PC Acquisitions's bid.    A spokesman for E.F. Hutton LBO, a subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc., said he didn't know whether the group was considering making a higher bid for Purolator. E.F. Hutton LBO said as of Tuesday night, about 880,000 Purolator common shares, or about 11.5% of the total outstanding, had been tendered. </TEXT></DOC>
