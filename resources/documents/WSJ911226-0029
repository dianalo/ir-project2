That's when it hit its 11-year lowof 8 5/8 amid rumors that the roof was about to cave in.   A few bold analysts are even willing at this point to saythe optimists will be right.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I think we've seen the bottom in the stock,&quot; said FrankDeSantis, banking analyst at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.Adds Stephen Berman of County NatWest Securities, &quot;I thinkyou could make some money in the stock.&quot;   There are plenty of doubters, and there's no dividend toconsole shareholders while they wait for an upturn. Analystsare lowering estimates of Citicorp results for the fourthquarter and 1992. And these can't be good times, given thatCiticorp felt compelled Tuesday to announce that it didn'tflunk an exam by regulators.   Nevertheless, the bullish Mr. DeSantis and colleagueThomas Brown correctly called the BankAmerica Corp.turnaround in 1987, and they believe the concept here issimilar: a battered company with a low stock price and hugeearnings potential in two to three years.   This week at least, the market seemed to think Citicorpwas on that track. Its stock sprung back with a 1/2 gainMonday and a further 5/8 rise to 9 3/4 Tuesday.   Helping to fuel the rise Tuesday was the announcement byCiticorp that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencyhad just finished its annual review. The company said Tuesdaythat credit write-offs and loan-loss provisions for thefourth quarter are &quot;in line with management's expectations.&quot;   Analysts and other industry officials took that to meanregulators are not requiring large special provisions forproblem loans. Forcing the banking giant to take a one-timemultibillion-dollar reserve against its $12.85 billioncommercial real estate portfolio -- the stuff of rumors formost of last week -- would wipe out a good chunk of thecompany's thin equity. About one-third of the commercial realestate portfolio is nonperforming. Citicorp's announcementshould put to rest rumors that regulators are about to seizeit -- speculation that pounded the stock late last week. Butwith fourth-quarter earnings still uncertain, most analystsare sticking with their nebulous &quot;hold&quot; recommendations.   The few analysts who remain bulls are betting that theconsumer and international franchises will grow morevaluable, and an economic turnaround could reduce the cost ofbad loans, turning the company into a earnings powerhouse bythe mid1990s. And Citicorp's shift toward funding the bankwith consumer deposits rather than wholesale money marketsshould keep its liquidity sources stable, they believe.   Mr. Berman of County NatWest Securities said the drasticcost-cutting under way should hit the bottom line by nextyear, and he likes the stock at current levels. The companyhas reduced its annual expense base by around $1 billion thisyear.   But aside from these and a couple of other analysts,there's a clear air of skepticism among most analysts. Manyon the Street believe that management must prove that it canslash expenses without hurting an already sluggish revenuebase, and they want evidence rather than promises. And bothMessrs. Berman and DeSantis acknowledge that they called thelows before, when the stock was still in double digits.   &quot;Everything has to go right. They have to deliver on theirexpense reduction plan,&quot; said Judah Kraushaar, bankinganalyst at Merrill Lynch, who was looking for a 15-centper-share profit in the quarter but has cut her estimate backto a nickel per share.   In fact, five brokerage firms have recently paredestimates for Citicorp's fourth quarter and 1992 earnings.The consensus estimate of 20 analysts is that Citicorp willearn a mere six cents a share this quarter and $1.06 nextyear, down from consensus estimates a week ago of 18 centsthis quarter and $1.54 next year, according to First Call.That would compare with a loss of $2.72 a share in the thirdquarter, when the banking giant eliminated its dividend andtook restructuring charges for more costcutting and awrite-down of its investment in Quotron Systems Inc.   Wall Street is concerned that the weakening economy willkeep the cost of bad loans high. Mr. Kraushaar is looking fora loss provision of $950 million, up from $896 million in thethird quarter. Industrywide, nonperforming loans are likelyto rise in the current quarter, many analysts now believe.   Such skeptics as Charles Peabody of East Shore PartnersInc. believe that even with a $1 billion provision, Citicorpis significantly underreserved for problem loans and needs toadd $3 billion to $4 billion for its commercial real estateportfolio.   At the same time, revenue, stubbornly flat in the thirdquarter, could be &quot;dead in the water,&quot; said Mr. Kraushaar.There's been little in the way of commercial lendingbusiness, and trading results are likely to be unspectacular,as evidenced by the weaker-than-expected earnings projectionsfrom Bankers Trust New York Corp.   Moreover, the company hasn't completed any major assetsales, proceeds of which would strengthen thin capitalratios. Industry officials said Citicorp has hired MorganStanley to find a buyer for its Quotron unit, which haschewed up more than a billion dollars in equity capital infive years.   The sale could fetch $150 million to $250 million,analysts say, though it's unclear whether Citicorp would booka gain. Another asset sale that didn't materialize is of43%-owned Reliance Electric Co., which was in talks to bebought by the German conglomerate Siemens AG.   Investors and analysts also point out that thethird-quarter results included onetime revenue kickers frominterest on loans to Brazil and equity investments that willnot be repeated in the fourth quarter.   &quot;There's nothing to prop up the revenue line,&quot; said Mr.Kraushaar.   While few are expecting drastic improvements in the fourthquarter, analysts say management must show tangible evidenceof change by the first quarter, such as another $500 millionto $600 million of cuts in annual operating costs from thethird-quarter 1990 figures. At the same time, bank managementmust hope that the pace of new nonperforming loans slows orstops by early next year. Most observers believe the boardhas given management, led by Chairman John S. Reed, until theend of the second quarter before making any changes.   &quot;The heat is on them to show some very solid evidence thatthey are moving dramatically and steadily,&quot; said Mr.Kraushaar. People who are proclaiming a bottom in the stockare &quot;a little premature.&quot;   ---   Citicorp   (NYSE; Symbol: CCI)                                                                                                          Business: Banking                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1990:   Net income: $458 milion*; 99 cents a share                                                                                                          Third quarter, Sept. 31, 1991:   Net loss: $2.72 a share vs. net income:   56 cents a share                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume: 1,984,277 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 343.5 million                                                                                                          *Includes $140 million credit; cumulative effect on priorperiods of an accounting change.</TEXT></DOC>
