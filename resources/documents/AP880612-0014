Hundreds of riot police firing volleys of tear gas pushed backwaves of charging students who sought to reach the offices of theDemocratic Justice Party. The screaming students hurled hundreds offirebombs, and streets were covered with blazing gasoline asrunning clashes flared across the center of the city.   ``Down with the military fascists,'' radical students yelled,and they hurled rocks and firebombs at police in Seoul's mainshopping district. Protesters destroyed a police truck withfirebombs.   But riot police quickly pushed protesters back and chased themthrough the city for several miles. Radicals hurled rocks at theJapanese Embassy's information office and smashed windows.   The fighting broke out during a funeral procession by about10,000 radical students and sympathizers for Park Rae-chun, whodied Monday after setting fire to himself in an anti-governmentprotest. It was the third ritual suicide by a radical student sinceMay 15.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent radical studentprotests during the past month. Thousands of students trying toreach North Korea for talks on reuniting the divided Koreanpeninsula battled riot police in major street clashes Friday.   Some marchers shouted ``Yankee go home'' Sunday, but the protestwas less anti-American than others in recent days. Instead, it wasdirected mainly at the government of President Roh Tae-woo.</TEXT></DOC>
