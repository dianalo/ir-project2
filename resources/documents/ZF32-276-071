 (See &quot;Special Report onMultimedia: Apple and IBM Gird for Battle,&quot; issue 5.14, 8-20-89.)andP;  It wantsto make sure that everybody knows that it isn't trying to redefined the verynature of the personal computer.andP;  And, just to get the point across, IBM'smultimedia development partner, Intel Corp., is announcing a new level offunctionality for its Digital Video Interactive technology, with its ownacronym called RTV, for real-time video (a capability first demonstrated inpublic at Agenda 90 by IBM PC chief Jim Cannavino).andM;In case you don't exactly recall my August story or what the heck symmetryis, let me refresh your memory -- briefly.andP;  The basic conflict betweensymmetry and asymmetry represents the difference between technologies thatcan both create and play content (cassette tape, magnetic media in a PC, 8mmvideo tape) and technologies that can only play back content that has beenmastered with a different and more expensive technology (CD audio, LPrecords, books).andP;  I proposed the notion that IBM intended to use anasymmetrical approach to PC-based multimedia technology, by building machinesthat were primarily intended as interactive players of CD-ROM basedapplications like truck-driver training, interior design catalogues,interactive encyclopedias, and a new generation of entertainment.andP;  At thesame time, I said that Apple was going to wait until it could deliver a fullysymmetrical implementation that would let any user produce multimediadocuments but, more importantly, would provide as standard the capability todo video e-mail and conferencing.andM;I was wrong, a little bit.andP;  IBM, like Apple, intends to deliver fullysymmetrical multimedia capabilities -- eventually.andP;  But there is a differencebetween the approaches the two companies plan to take.andP;  Apple seems to wantto wait until it can make the symmetrical capabilities a standard componentof their computers.andP;  That capability hangs on figuring out how to digitize,compress, and decompress live, full-screen video images at TV-levelresolution and speed (30 frames a second) and then store and transmit thosefiles using standard equipment, which is not an easy thing to do.andP;  Applehasn't forecast when it will be able to do that, although it implies that itexpects to be able to deliver these capabilities standard in the 1993-1994time frame.andP;  Intel says it will be able to deliver the silicon in one or twochips with sufficient power (which it refers to as video-rate digital signalprocessing) by late 1991 (two years from now), but confesses that it doesn'tknow how to store or transmit the files in any standard, cost-effectivemanner as yet.andM;IBM, on the other hand, isn't going to wait.andP;  It will deliver various piecesof the technology in three and possibly four or more stages over the nextfive to ten years.andP;  First, it will deliver a machine that can play backinteractive CD-ROM-based software with photo-quality stills andanimation-level motion video.andP;  Second, it will deliver a machine that canplay back interactive CD-ROM-based software with TV-quality video.andP;  Third(and possibly in the same machine as the second stage), it will deliver amachine that can digitize and compress and store live video at VCR- orpossibly TV-level quality.andP;  Fourth, it will deliver a machine that can go allthe way: digitize, compress, decompress, store, and transmit live video atTV-level quality (or, potentially, at high-definition-level quality).andP;  And,with Intel as its partner, it will reach the point early in the next centurywhere these capabilities are actually integrated into the main processor, theway that math processing and caching have been integrated into the 80486.andM;So, instead of framing the issue in terms of symmetry and asymmetry, I shouldhave presented the question as incremental delivery versus revolutionarytechnology.andP;  IBM will, as it has introduced new levels of computer graphicsthrough the MDA, CGA, EGA, VGA, and 8514/A progression, introduceincreasingly more capable levels of digital video capabilities.andP;  Softwaredevelopers and customers will have to learn to live with the upgrade processthat that incurs, and the costs associated with getting those upgrades.andP;  Butthey will get the basic capabilities earlier and have more time to learnabout the technology and its uses, even if compromised in its early forms.andO;Apple will, as it has in the past, hold off on introducing these newcapabilities until it can deliver a level of functionality that it deemsinherently superior and more polished than what IBM can offer at the time.andO;That way, its customers will have to wait longer.andP;  But, once they get thecapability, software developers will have a higher quality platform todevelop for as standard and the experience and value of using the softwareshould theoretically be greater.andM;This all sounds very rational and purposeful, but I have to admit that I amsuspicious of both sides.andP;  No company or individual in this industry hasconsistently shown the ability to predict the right way to approach newtechnologies.andP;  Instead, great insights seem to be more the product of acapricious series of unrelated events that collectively produce a unintendedbut functional result.andP;  So one is lead to wonder where the capricious elementis in all of this multimedia strategizing.andP;  I certainly can't see it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
