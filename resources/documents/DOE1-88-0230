The concentration of /sup 85/Kr in the earth'satmosphere is expected to increase as the nuclear power program is expandingseveral projections of nuclear power growth indicated a remote possibilityof /sup 85/Kr concentration in the atmosphere eventually reaching 3x10/sup-7/ {mu}Ci/cm/sup 3/ in about the year of 2050. Annually immerging toa semi-infinite cloud of /sup 85/Kr with this concentration would resultin a calculated dose equivalent of 7 mrem to the whole body and 300 mremto the skin (7 mg/cm/sup 2/ depth). It will cause more than 2000 deathsper year due to cancers if there is an average dose equivalent of 10mrem to the skin and 0.1 mrem to the whole body. The main source of /sup85/Kr in air of Taiwan is the release from the off-gas systems of thenuclear power plants. The aim of this research is to set up to rapidseparation method for determining /sup 85/Kr concentration in environmentalair samples in Taiwan area.</TEXT></DOC>
