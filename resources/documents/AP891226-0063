Armed with stiff new regulations passed under the Bank SecrecyAct of 1988, the IRS and other federal agencies are forcingbusinesses and financial institutions to help track the estimated$220 million in profits generated daily by illegal drug sales inthis country.   ``All that cash does no good stored in boxes. They have to turnit around. That necessarily involves legitimate businesses,'' saidMiami lawyer Charles Intriago, who has started a publication thatpromises to make sense of the regulatory maze and keep subscriberson the right side of the law.   ``The government has conscripted the entire business communityand required them to submit their paper trails,'' Intriago said.``It's saying, `OK, you're in the war now _ play by the rules orface severe penalties.'''   Money Laundering Alert is an eight-page monthly newsletter ofadvice, statistics and reports on what criminals do to hide thesource of their money and what government is doing to uncover theirschemes.   As trade journals go, Alert has a sizeable niche, says Intriago,a former chief counsel for the House committee that oversees allbanking regulatory agencies. He also has prosecuted white-collarcriminals and drug traffickers as an assistant U.S. attorney inMiami.   Amid growing calls for the legalization of drugs and evidencethat interdiction efforts have failed to reduce the cocaine flowinginto this country, money laundering controls have become thegovernment's weapon of choice, Intriago said.   ``The money laundering initiative has a higher probability ofsuccess than the others, such as interdiction. It hits the profitmotive,'' he said.   Enlisting the help of banks and other often unwittinghandmaidens to drug traffickers has already yielded impressiveresults.   Days before billionaire Medellin cartel enforcer GonzaloRodriguez Gacha was gunned down in Colombia on Dec. 15, U.S. andSwiss officials traced his profits and were able to freeze $61.8million of his assets in several countries.   Under money laundering laws, banks are required to report largecash transactions. Soon, the Treasury Department could also forcebanks to put names and addresses on the estimated $1.25 trilliontransferred daily around the world on telephone lines. Details ofthat initiative are laid out in Alert's November issue.   These new money laundering laws are still in their infancy andmany have yet to be enforced. Many otherwise law-abiding businessesmay be unaware of the penalties they face, Intriago said.   Alert costs $295 a year, but Intriago notes that the TreasuryDepartment can now impose $500 fines for every negligent error abank teller makes on one of the required forms.   ``Tell me these institutions wouldn't like to receive apublication that could spare them thousands of dollars in fines, tosay nothing of the bad publicity,'' Intriago said.   With the fourth issue going to press, Alert has more than 200subscribers, ranging from banks, thrifts and credit unions tolawyers and accountants, foreign governments and diplomatic offices.   Intriago doesn't mention ``drug kingpins'' on his list, and hebristles at the suggestion that his newsletter could be as usefulto criminals as to law-abiding citizens.   ``We don't do criminal background checks on our subscribers, nordoes The Wall Street Journal,'' he said. ``A number of criminaldefense attorneys have subscriptions, however.''   One of those attorneys sits on the newsletter's editorial boardas well: Neal Sonnett of Miami, who represented Panamanian Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega when he was indicted on drug traffickingcharges in Florida.   ``He's a very respected attorney,'' Intriago said, ``no matterwhat his clientele is.''</TEXT></DOC>
