One of the issues is whether Meese interceded with INSLAW Inc.'slaw firm and whether that had anything to do with the subsequentdismissal of the lawyer representing the company.   The Justice Department's public integrity section also isreviewing conflicts in the sworn testimony of two former federalbankruptcy trustees and two Justice Department officials duringbankruptcy court proceedings involving INSLAW, according to sourceswho spoke on condition of anonymity.   The testimony dealt with INSLAW's allegations that JusticeDepartment officials sought to put the company out of business bytrying, unsuccessfully, to convert its bankruptcy reorganization toan outright liquidation.   Independent counsel James C. McKay, who is conducting a criminalinvestigation of Meese in several areas, is not probing the INSLAWcase but did refer information about it to the public integritysection.   ``We are not conducting an investigation with respect to theINSLAW matter,'' said Carol Bruce, McKay's deputy. ``Anyinformation we have received relating to it we have referred to theJustice Department's public integrity section.''   But the section, after reviewing the material, could return itto McKay's office for a fuller investigation of the Meeseallegation, according to a source familiar with the case.   INSLAW attorneys told McKay that the company's original lawyer,Leigh Ratiner, was fired from his Washington law firm after Meesediscussed the case with Leonard Garment, a politically connectedpartner in the same firm.   The Justice Department acknowledged to INSLAW in pre-trialdiscovery that Meese recalled talking to Garment about the case inthe fall of 1986.   Ratiner was soon asked to leave the law firm of Dickstein,Shapiro andamp; Morin. INSLAW says in court papers that Ratiner was toldGarment was instrumental in the decision to ask him to leave.   Garment called the allegation ``pure baloney'' but acknowledgedthat he was questioned about it two months ago by public-integrityinvestigators. The current status of the Meese investigation couldnot immediately be determined.   The perjury investigation involves sworn depositions orcourtroom testimony given by witnesses in connection with INSLAW'sallegation that the Justice Department tried to force INSLAW into aliquidation proceeding in bankruptcy court.   INSLAW alleged that Justice Department officials deliberatelywithheld $1.77 million in payments on a $10 million contract thecompany had signed in 1982 to computerize 94 U.S. attorneys'offices.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George F. Bason Jr. found in INSLAW'sfavor and ordered the Justice Department to pay the company $6.8million after ruling that government officials engaged in``trickery, fraud and deceit'' to steal the company's software. Thedepartment is appealing.   Conversion of the case from a Chapter 11 reorganization to aChapter 7 liquidation would have put INSLAW out of business. UnderChapter 11 protection from creditors, INSLAW has been able toreorganize and build up clients while arranging to pay off itsdebts.   Cornelius Blackshear, a federal bankruptcy judge in New YorkCity, gave a sworn deposition last year that when he was a U.S.trustee in 1985 he was asked to help liquidate INSLAW by Thomas J.Stanton, head of the Justice Department's Executive Office of U.S.Trustees.   But a day after he was deposed, Blackshear signed an affidavitrecanting the testimony, saying he had confused INSLAW with anotherbankruptcy matter.   Blackshear then gave a second deposition that was consistentwith the affidavit.   In his ruling last year, Bason expressed disbelief aboutBlackshear's recantation, although he called it ``an honestmistake.''   ``I believe that Judge Blackshear's original testimony isaccurate and his recanted testimony is inaccurate,'' Bason said.   The judge noted that Blackshear changed his initial testimonyafter receiving telephone calls from William C. White, then U.S.bankruptcy trustee in Alexandria, Va.   White denied allegations that the Justice Department pressuredhim to file a motion to liquidate INSLAW, to which Bason said that``people do have a capacity to forget things when it is painful forthem to remember _ or maybe even inconvenient for them toremember.''   Bason said White's testimony was ``contrary to other credibleevidence.''   Bason also rejected Stanton's sworn denials, saying: ``I foundMr. Stanton's testimony in crucial respects to be evasive andunbelievable.'' At another point, he said Stanton's testimony was``utterly incredible and unworthy of belief.''   Neither Blackshear, Stanton nor White returned a reporter'stelephone messages.   The public integrity section is reviewing the testimony ofBlackshear, Stanton, White and Anthony F. Pasciuto, who recentlyresigned as deputy director of the trustees office, the sourcessaid.   Pasciuto has provided fresh allegations that Blackshear'srecantation was false.   In a letter by his lawyer to the Justice Department, Pasciutoalleged that Blackshear admitted to him last summer that therecantation was false.   ``I felt the easiest thing I could do was recant,'' Pasciutoquotes Blackshear as saying. ``I felt less people would be hurt ifI just bailed out.''   Pasciuto's lawyer, Gary Simpson, wrote the letter to then-DeputyAttorney General Arnold Burns to protest Justice Department effortsto fire his client for violating regulations by meeting with INSLAWpresident William Hamilton and Hamilton's wife, Nancy.   Pasciuto was allowed to resign and has joined a privatefinancial firm in New York.   During the meeting, Pasciuto told the Hamiltons about pressurefrom Stanton to liquidate their company. But in court testimony,Pascuito said his statements to the Hamiltons were fabricated _made up to injure Stanton for delaying a long-awaited promotion.   Told of the investigation, Pasciuto's lawyer said: ``TonyPasciuto has the documentation that many of the things he wassaying were true.''   Bason concluded that Stanton sought to liquidate INSLAW to``curry favor'' with Justice Department officials following aconversation with C. Madison Brewer, who administered the INSLAWcontract.   Brewer previously worked for INSLAW but was fired, and the judgeconcluded that Brewer was ``consumed by hatred and an intensedesire for revenge.''   The department's Office of Professional Responsibility isinvestigating Brewer's conduct.</TEXT></DOC>
