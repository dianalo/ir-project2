Gorbachev.   ``It is fair to say that the situation is serious,'' Secretaryof State James A. Baker III said. ``We have provided some airsupport, air cover.''   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said, ``no U.S.planes have fired any shots or intercepted any rebel aircraft.''   He also said a contingent of 100 Marines had been sent from thebase in the Philippines to defend the U.S. Embassy in Manila.   ``We're cautiously optimistic based upon reports we have fromthe Philippine government that the government forces seem to beprevailing,'' Rear Adm. Edward D. Scheafer of the DefenseIntelligence Agency said in Washington.   The air assistance came at the request of Philippine PresidentCorazon Aquino, who spoke by telephone to Vice President Dan Quayle.   ``She was very grateful for the call and very grateful for theassistance, and seemed to be confident, but that was several hoursago,'' Bush said.   His national security adviser Brent Scowcroft said U.S. forces``were not in the thick of anything. They are simply providing aircover. That's all we have been requested to do.''   Williams was asked at a Pentagon briefing how far the UnitedStates would go in providing military help to keep Mrs. Aquino inpower. He replied, ``That's awful speculative.'' Williams said thatBush's order ``authorizes assistance, without force if possible,with force, if required.''   He declined to say whether any consideration was being given toevacuating some 20,000 American dependents of military personnelstationed in the Philippines, principally Subic Bay and Clark AirForce Base. There are some 15,000 U.S. military personnel stationedto the Philippines.   In a statement issued from Air Force One as Bush flew to thisisland nation, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,``This assistance is intended to allow the democratically electedgovernment of the Philippines to restore order. The president alsois determined to protect the lives of Americans in thePhilippines.''   Fitzwater said today that he was not aware of any requests forU.S. assistance beyond the air cover. Asked if Bush would telephoneMrs. Aquino, he said, ``It is not clear he will call her todaybecause of the nature of her situation.''   Mrs. Aquino, in Manila, said, ``Even now, U.S. fighters arejoining the fight to give air cover to our ground troops. Oncemore, two Pacific democracies stand shoulder-to-shoulder in thedefense of freedom.''   A Bush administration official said the U.S. fighters wereauthorized to fire ``only if (rebel) planes are attempting to takeoff from these two bases, but that would be only after repeatedwarnings.''   The F-4s from Clark Air Base were flying combat air patrols, andthere were no reports of engagements with rebel aircraft, Obornsaid this morning.   The Bush administration official confirmed that the U.S. planesbegan flying over the two rebel-held Philippine air bases shortlyafter the presidential authorization came at 12:32 a.m. EST today.   ``The goal in this authorization has been to discourage anyhostile attempt on the part of the rebels in the Philippines.President Aquino's request was very specific and that was toconduct an aggressive cap over two Philippine air bases, Villamorand Sangley Point,'' the official said.   The official said the U.S. aid involved solely those flightsover the bases, and added that ground military personnel were notinvolved. It was not immediately known how many planes were beingused.   The coup attempt has left at least 10 dead and 64 wounded, andwas the most serious since a civilian-military uprising swept Mrs.Aquino to power in February 1986 and forced the late PresidentFerdinand E. Marcos into exile.   On Thursday, the White House condemned the coup attempt andthreatened to cut off U.S. aid if the Aquino government is ousted.Meanwhile, the State Department warned Americans not to travel inthe Philippines.   Fitzwater said Thursday: ``We reiterate the unequivocal supportof the U.S. government for Philippine democracy and the governmentof President Corazon Aquino. We strongly condemn the effort todestabilize the elected Philippine government.''   He added that, ``according to U.S. law, all U.S. foreignassistance to the Philippines would be suspended if the electedgovernment of the Philippines were removed by a military coup.''   Rep. Steven J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the Asia-Pacificsubcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said asuccessful coup would be ``a colossal disaster'' that would playright into the hands of the Communist-led rebels.   Late Thursday, the State Department issued a warning againsttravel in the Philippines.   The department established a monitoring group to trackdevelopments in the Philippines around the clock, its second suchgroup to be activated. Another task force is monitoringdevelopments in El Salvador.   Mrs. Aquino visited the White House Nov. 8 and received Bush'spromise of continued U.S. aid for her government, established fouryears ago after dictator Ferdinand Marcos was driven from power.   The United States and the Philippines are scheduled to opennegotiations in December on the future of the lease agreements fortwo major U.S. military installations, Clark Air Base and Subic BayNaval Station, as well as smaller facilities in the Philippines.The current leases expire in September 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
