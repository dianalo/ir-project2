The state agency quoted a source at the army's general command assaying alleged plotters loyal to deposed President Gaafar Nimeirihad a two-part plan.   One group was to assassinate political leaders, includingcivilian Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, while another occupied vitaland strategic departments such as the army general command and theradio station.   He did not say if others were suspected in the plot. Thosearrested still were being interrogated and no charges had been putyet, he said.   The military source said Dec. 7 alleged ringleader Lt. Col.Hassan Mohammed Ahmed Nasr told his associates that Dec. 8 was zerohour, but that they would have problems securing fuel.   Gasoline is rationed in Sudan and car owners have to queue forseveral hours for their weekly supply.   The source said Nasr recruited an army depot worker to supply thefuel, but the coup plotters were arrested before they could maketheir move.   Nine of the 16 arrested are military men, he said, including aretired major general, two retired brigadiers, five non-commissionedofficers and Lt. Col. Nasr. He said another 1st Lt. MohammedSuleiman still is at large.   The rest are politicians and other civilians who worked inNimeiri's dissolved state security and special guards forces.   Nimeiri was ousted April 5, 1985, by the military, who handedpower to a democratically elected government in 1986.   Nimeiri was stranded in Cairo, Egypt, and has remained theresince. He is not allowed any political activities by his Egyptianhosts and there has not been any evidence linking him to the abortedcoup.   In a separate development, the government Monday imposed hugeprice increases on sugar, cigarettes and other commodities, just twodays after announcing salary increases for workers in both publicand private sectors.   Information Minister Abdulla Mohammed Ahmed announced theincreases in a statement published by the state news agency.   From Tuesday, the price of a pound of sugar was increased morethan 600 percent from 4.3 cents to 26 cents. Prices of imported andlocally produced cigarettes were increased by 50 percent. Inaddition, the government imposed a 15 percent tax on all locallymanufactured commodities.   On Saturday, Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi announced pay increasesof between 500 percent and 50 percent for all workers on a slidingscale so lowest paid workers get the biggest increases.   Although Sudan produces more sugar than it needs, there arecontinuous shortages fueled by smuggling to neighbouring countrieslike Uganda, Zaire, Chad and Ethiopia, where the sweetener costs alot more. On the black market in Khartoum, a pound of sugar nowcosts between 43 and 61 cents.   Ahmed said the government hopes the higher price will rationconsumption and combat smuggling.</TEXT></DOC>
