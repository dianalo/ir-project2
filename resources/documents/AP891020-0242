(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Imagine working in a factorywhere dense smoke and gases make it hard to see or breathe, toxicdusts coat the floor and the heat in some spots approaches 250degrees _ beyond boiling water.   This isn't a 19th-century sweatshop but, prosecutors claim, amodern-day plant, the Chicago Magnet Wire Corp., a place sohazardous that the people who ran it were nothing short of criminal.   Five current and former Chicago Magnet executives await trial oncharges that they knowingly allowed conditions that gave more than40 workers nerve and lung disorders and other ailments. The U.S.Supreme Court refused this month to hear their appeal, challenginglocal prosecutors' jurisdiction.   This case is among a small but growing number of criminalcharges filed against company officials for workplace deaths andinjuries. There have been others in California, Wisconsin, Michian,Indiana, New York, Texas and Illinois, the latter the site of thenation's first corporate murder convictions for an employee'scyanide poisoning.   ``We're likely to see more criminal prosecutions in this area,''said James Holzhauer, a University of Chicago law school lecturer.   Some prosecutors argue that monetary penalties imposed by theOccupational Safety and Health Administration are often too smallto deter employers.   ``Some people don't care if they're fined. They pass that alongto the consumer,'' said Frank Parkerson, a Cook County prosecutorin the Chicago Magnet case. ``People do care about going to jailfor 25 years.''   ``This is not applying a different standard to employers than weapply to every other citizen,'' said Ken Oden, Travis Countyattorney in Texas. ``You can't drive 120 miles an hour out of aschool zone, run over a child and say you can't be criminallyresponsible because you didn't intend the results.''   But opponents say this approach could lead to a patchwork oflocal and state safety standards and undercuts OSHA, which hasreferred 55 cases to the Justice Department for criminalprosecution since its formation in 1970. About a quarter weresettled in pleas or trials, and the Justice Department declinedprosecution in the rest, OSHA said.   Workplace prosecutions are ``basically unfair to business and Idon't think it advances workers' safety and health,'' said StephenBokat, U.S. Chamber of Commerce general counsel.   ``Corporate executives have no warning of what's expected ofthem,'' added Bokat, who filed a brief in the Chicago Magnet case.``It's really an after-the-fact determination by a prosecutor thatsomething's not safe.''   A key contention in this debate _ that OSHA pre-empts localprosecutions _ reached the U.S. Supreme Court after being rejectedby the Illinois Supreme Court, which said ``state criminal law canprovide a valuable and forceful supplement'' for worker protection.   Attorneys for Chicago Magnet argued that local prosecutors andjuries, who may be ``uninformed and ... unconcerned,'' are lessqualified to ensure safety than experienced federal officials whoset uniform standards.   ``Whether criminal laws should be applied is a legislativedecision,'' added attorney Robert Stephenson. ``If (you) want to dosomething, change the law.''   But the Supreme Court let stand the Illinois ruling.   The pre-emption issue didn't stop the Los Angeles Countydistrict attorney's office, which has a special unit for such cases.   Four people convicted of involuntary manslaughter have servedjail terms and nearly 30 misdemeanors have been prosecuted, saidFred Macksoud, deputy district attorney.   ``These are cases where the employers were just cutting cornersmore than anything,'' he said. ``They thought they could get awaywith it. ... (But) they kill people by cutting corners.''   The average fine ranges from $11,000 to $30,000, Macksoud added,about five times higher than OSHA's civil penalties.   Despite some successes, prosecutors filing criminal charges inworkplace accident cases are trying ``to put new wine in an oldbottle,'' in the view of Bill Maakestead, associate professor ofbusiness law and management at Western Illinois University, whodoes not expect a proliferation of prosecutions.   ``These cases tend to be the more expensive, the more timeconsuming'' and require investigative expertise often lacking inprosecutors' offices, he said, terming effective OSHA standards abetter way to ensure safety.   Even so, he added, ``in egregious cases, you need that kind ofsymbolic legal mechanism to send a strong signal.''   Experts say that message was sent in the 1985 landmark murderconviction of three officials of Film Recovery Systems Inc. of ElkGrove Village in the cyanide poisoning of Stefan Golab, a Polishimmigrant working in the silver recovery plant.   Golab had to work over open vats of cyanide solution but wasn'tinformed of the risks or given adequate protective gear _prosecutors said paper masks were provided. He also was refused atransfer after showing cyanide exposure symptoms.   Workers testified they suffered headaches, dizziness andvomiting. One said the only time respirators were provided was whenan inspector visited.   Judge Ronald Banks called Golab's death ``not accidental, but infact murder.'' The convictions are being appealed.   In the Chicago Magnet case, the company and five officials areaccused of aggravated battery, reckless conduct and conspiracy.Prosecutors said the plant was comparable to ``the `sweat shops' ofthe mid-19th century.''   ``Abominable'' was prosecutor Parkerson's description ofconditions at the plant where wire was coated with polyvinylchloride and other chemicals.   Court papers claim temperatures on the catwalks approached 250degrees, the air was smoky, workers weren't given adequate masks,gloves or boots, they were exposed to the kinds of gases used asweapons during World War I and were hit in the chest, face, headand neck with broken wire fragments.   Prosecutors claim 43 workers suffered nerve disorders,impotence, kidney failure, toxic hepatitis or other injuries. Onedoctor said the combination of aluminum dust on the floor andanother chemical used at the hot plant causes brain damage and isassociated with Alzheimer's disease.   Until 1982, Parkerson said, the plant averaged more than fourtimes as many injuries as employees.   OSHA said it last inspected Chicago Magnet in August 1988 and nocitations were issued. Four citations in the previous 12 years,alleging noise violations, failure to inspect respirators and otherinfractions, were settled for minimal amounts.   The defense has thus far addressed only pre-emption. But Bokat'sbrief says the state ``has never contested the defendants' claimthat working conditions were in compliance with OSHA standards.''   Parkerson said the opportunity hasn't arisen yet.   ``OSHA just can't deal with people who have no intention offollowing the law at all,'' he said.   ``The basic problem is the whole mentality of the business,which deals only in money, profits and losses and accepts the ideaimplicitly that human health, safety and life is expendable to somedegree. We've got to change that kind of attitude.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regionalreporter, based in Chicago.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday PMs, Oct. 25</NOTE></DOC>
