(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush said Wednesday his newbudget plan will force Congress and the White House to make ``hardchoices'' on spending cuts so that more money can be targeted forsocial programs, the environment, educaton and the space program.   But Bush, speaking to the South Carolina legislature, did notoffer any suggestions about where to reduce spending. Democratscomplain that Bush is taking credit for raising spending fordomestic programs while making Congress share responsibility forunpopular cuts.   Bush flew here as part of a series of appearances around thecountry to extol the $1.16 trillion budget he unveiled last week.The president will travel to St. Louis on Friday for a speech andlunch with students at Washington University.   The expanded social programs proposed in Bush's budget would haveto be offset by up to $11 billion in spending reductions to keep thedeficit down.   Bush got a friendly reception from the Democratic-controlledlegislature. Speaking in the cavernous, white-brick House chamber,the president said:   ``I speak to you in the spirit of bipartisanship. I've got to _you've got us outnumbered.''   Bush made a pitch for his proposed reduction in the capital gainstax to a maximum of 15 percent. Now, capital gains are taxed asordinary income.   The president said that change would spur investment and producemore tax revenues while, at the same time, making America morecompetitive in international markets.   ``All of our biggest trading partners, including Japan and WestGermany, tax long-term capital gains modestly if at all,'' Bush said.   Pledging anew not to raise taxes, Bush said that reducing thedeficit means the government will have to make tough choices.   ``My budget is a realistic plan that does more for education,more for the environment and more for the space program,'' he said.Moreover, he said it would increase spending for Head Start, the waragainst drugs, child care and other social programs.   Bush said that projected economic growth would result in up to$80 billion in additional tax revenue.   But spending more on ``priority programs,'' he said, wouldrequire that savings be found elsewhere in the budget.   ``And I am prepared to work with the Congress to make those hardchoices,'' Bush said.   ``We weren't sent to Washington _ any of us up there _ to sit onour hands, either to pass the cost of indecision onto workingAmericans by raising their taxes or to fail to reduce the deficit,which will cause the cuts to be done automatically under the law,''the president said.   Faced with a Congress controlled by Democrats, Bush said, ``Iwill seek to work'' with the House and the Senate ``not as membersof competing political parties but as cooperating public servants.''   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's budgetchief, Richard Darman, would meet during the day with congressionalstaff people to discuss Bush's budget proposal.   ``Details are being exchanged all the time,'' Fitzwater said.``Darman goes up there with an armload of books and numbers sothere'll be detail.''   Fitzwater acknowledged Tuesday that the administration had notoffered a separate proposal for filling a $9.6 billion to $11billion gap in the amount of money available to finance Bush'sdomestic spending initiatives.   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the SenateAppropriations Committee, and Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., head of theSenate Budget Committee, told Bush in a letter that if he failed toprovide more detail on areas that will need to be cut, Congresswould ``have no alternative'' but to assume that he endorses thereductions that Reagan proposed last month.</TEXT></DOC>
