The suit, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that the illegal operation used Western Union resources to offer telecommunications services to Latin American governments, and even bribed officials in several countries in that continent. The conspiracy extended into other businesses, and even involved attempts to sell helicopters and other military equipment to the governments of Peru and Ecuador, the suit claims.    Western Union isn't claiming a specific amount of damages. It alleges that John Lanzelotti, a New Jersey resident who worked as regional vice president, Western hemisphere, for Western Union from June 1, 1982, until he was dismissed last Feb. 12, secretly was employed by a Delaware company, Intelco International Inc., and its related entities in Panama and Venezuela.    Mr. Lanzelotti, who was Western Union's senior executive for Latin America, had a substantial financial interest in the Intelco entities, the suit alleges.    Lawyers for Western Union declined to quantify the alleged bribes or the losses Western Union had incurred. &quot;We know (the losses) are very substantial, but at this stage we don't know the full extent,&quot; said Grant S. Lewis, an attorney at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby andamp; McRae, a New York law firm acting for Western Union.    All the defendants were part of a large conspiracy that appropriated Western Union business, the suit alleges. For instance, the suit says a Panamanian concern that was meant to be acting as Western Union's representative and sales agent in Venezuela and Panama, and had express and implied duties of undivided loyalty to the company, in fact was serving Intelco and its related entities.    The defendants also associated Intelco's name with that of Western Union to deceive the telecommunication company's customers and to try to take away its Latin American business, the suit says.    The alleged conspiracy also went beyond telecommunications. According to the suit, Mr. Lanzelotti and some of his associates unlawfully sought to supply helicopters and other equipment to the armed forces of Peru and Ecuador. One associate even tried to sell a water-distribution and sewerage project to Ecuador, and also &quot;involved the conspiracy in a scheme to sell a satellite-earth station to the government of San Marino,&quot; the lawsuit claims.    The suit doesn't indicate whether these attempts were successful.    Mr. Lanzelotti, reached at Intelco's office in Woodbridge, N.J., said he hadn't seen a copy of the complaint. &quot;I think this is just retaliation on the part of Western Union to suits brought by their former employees in Latin America for nonpayment of salaries and expenses,&quot; he said. Mr. Lanzelotti later said that these disputes hadn't actually resulted in suits but in fact were being settled by arbitration.    However, Mr. Lewis, the attorney for Western Union, denied Mr. Lanzelotti's statement that there are &quot;arbitration claims&quot; against Western Union from the defendants named in the suit.    Intelco was set up in early 1988, Mr. Lanzelotti said, and he denied he had any financial interest in that company. &quot;I'm just running the company,&quot; he said, and declined to comment on Intelco's ownership. Mr. Lanzelotti denied he had ever paid bribes to Latin American officials or that he had ever sold, or tried to sell helicopters and military equipment to Latin American governments, as the suit alleges. &quot;I'm in the telecommunications business,&quot; he said.    The suit listed the defendants as Intelco; the related Panamanian and Venezuelan entities; Mr. Lanzelotti; Swift Global Communications Inc., another Delaware-incorporated company; George Abi Zeid of Glen Head, N.Y., who runs Swift; other companies in Panama and Israel; and people who have been residents of Panama, Venezuela and Israel.    Reached at his office in New York, Mr. Abi Zeid said, &quot;I have no idea at all what . . . they're talking about,&quot; when the suit was described to him.    Western Union, based in Upper Saddle River, N.J., is a communications-services and money-transfer concern. Last December, the company narrowly avoided filing for protection from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code. </TEXT></DOC>
