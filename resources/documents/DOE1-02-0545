In order to maximize drilling success and increaseproduction from a fractured reservoir, development approaches that willwork toward accomplishing those goals must be recognized and used. Twoapproaches are available to the petroleum industry: field developmentand reserves development. These methods are not mutually exclusive, buttheir components differ enough to provide a choice when confronted withthis situation. Field development is concerned with the geologic frameworkof reservoirs as related to delineating pool boundaries, locating drillsites, and establishing calculable reserves. Field development has beenpracticed to a great extent in competitive drilling of non-unitized pools.Reserves development mainly involves reservoir drainage, and is commonlyused in unit operations. When considering a water-free, heterogeneouslyfractured reservoir, the former approach is economically more relevantthan the latter, because interpolated geologic determinants for economicproduction generally are more effective than extrapolated engineeringinterpretations. A disadvantage of using reserves development exclusivelyis in the tendency toward empirical reasoning that is inherent to thismethod. The field development approach should, of course, recognize andincorporate engineering data in order to evaluate development economics.Examples of the two contrasting approaches are Gavilan Mancos and PuertoChiquito Mancos West fields, located on the eastern flank of the SanJuan basin in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. Whatever the perceptionof money or economic scenarios at any point in time, developing reservesin heterogeneous, water-free fractured reservoirs can be significantlyenhanced by emphasizing field development as a method of studying reservoirdynamics rather than emphasizing reserves development alone.</TEXT></DOC>
