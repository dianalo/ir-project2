The cereal contains psyllium, a soluble fiber commonlyused as a laxative. Because the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration hasn't yet decided whether psyllium in cerealis safe, the Texas health department has banned the sale ofHeartwise in the state -- although the product continues toappear in some stores. The state seized some early shipmentsof the cereal.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, Judge A. Joe Fish ruled that because the onlyofficially recognized use of psyllium for human consumptionis as a bulk laxative, it qualifies as a drug. That, he said,makes Heartwise a delivery vehicle for a drug, and Texas lawprohibits the sale of an unapproved drug.   In promotional material, Kellogg has said that&quot;substantial research has documented the effectiveness of alow-fat, high-soluble fiber diet&quot; in lowering bloodcholesterol levels.   Reacting to such messages, Judge Fish wrote that &quot;whenhealing powers are attributed to a food, they become drugs&quot;within the meaning of the state law.   Officials at Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., saidthat although the judge rejected the company's request for apreliminary injunction lifting the ban, &quot;we believe that whenthe court takes a more indepth look at the facts, it willsupport our position.&quot;   Psyllium in cereals has been a source of continuingcontroversy since General Mills Inc. introduced its versionof such a product in 1989. Called Benefit, it was distributedin only about 15 states before the company withdrew it earlylast year amid questions about psyllium's effectiveness inreducing cholesterol.   Kellogg introduced Heartwise a few months after Benefitappeared. In October 1989 the FDA sent letters to bothcompanies asking them to show why they should continue tomarket the products. But the FDA, which still has the issuebefore it, stopped short of ordering cereals with psylliumoff the market.</TEXT></DOC>
