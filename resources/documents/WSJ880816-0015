President Roh Tae Woo told the nation his government won't tolerate violent campus protest. He said unchecked student activism would endanger the Olympic Games, which open Sept. 17 in Seoul. This was expected to be the last attempt by students to march to the border before the Games.    Officers were seen taking away hundreds of protesters who tried to march from Seoul to the truce village of Panmunjom, 35 miles north of the capital, for talks with North Korean student leaders. Witnesses saw dozens of protesters and police officers injured, but statistics weren't available. Authorities said they arrested 1,300 students but released many.    In a speech marking the 43rd anniversary of Korea's independence from Japanese colonial rule, Mr. Roh said: &quot;We cannot any longer tolerate activities which destroy free democracy, our way of life.&quot;    He also proposed a summit with President Kim Il Sung of North Korea to discuss the future of the peninsula, which was divided at the end of World War II. Similar past proposals have led nowhere, but the two Koreas are considering parliamentary talks on easing tension. </TEXT></DOC>
