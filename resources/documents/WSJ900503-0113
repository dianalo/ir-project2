The debate appeared to be over determining which membersof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries shouldcarry the burden of reduced production this month and next,and the base from which cuts should be figured.</LP><TEXT>   The delay so far isn't viewed as a serious threat to thegenerally accepted goal of the session, which is to prop upsagging world oil prices with a short-term productioncutback.   Informal talks among the oil ministers continued late intothe night, and several remained optimistic. &quot;It's just anormal course of developments,&quot; Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oilminister, said in an interview.   The formal session of OPEC's monitoring committee -- butwith all 13 nations represented -- had been scheduled tobegin yesterday afternoon, after the late arrival of Iran'soil minister. But as the day wore on, it was postponedseveral times. It has been rescheduled for today.   Several delegates said they still expect to keep themeeting brief. All want a fast agreement -- in two days atthe most -- because they hope that will provide a &quot;quick fix&quot;to oil markets that have deteriorated because of OPEC'soverproduction.   The ministers remain convinced that only a majorshort-term cut in production -- one million to two millionbarrels a day -- can support oil prices, which have fallen25% so far this year.   However, by embracing that strategy, the ministers haveput themselves in an unfamiliar position: Instead ofsquabbling over how to allocate a rise in production, asoften occurs at their meetings, they are arguing about how toallocate a cut.   So far, according to individuals close to yesterday'sinformal deliberations, the debate over apportioning a cutturns on two main suggestions: that all member-nations reduceoutput by 5% to 10%; or that the Persian Gulf countries ofSaudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, allcurrently producing over their quotas, bear the brunt of thereduction. If every country stuck to its quota, OPEC's totalproduction would drop from the current 23.5 million barrels aday to 22 million, the group's official production ceilingfor the first half of this year.   But Kuwait and the Emirates, chronic overproducers, areunlikely to go for strict adherence to quotas. By stubbornlyignoring its past production allotments, Kuwait has been ableto force an increase in its official quota to a current 1.5million barrels a day, and its recent output has ranged up totwo million a day. The Emirates also have won specialtreatment in the past and are now producing two millionbarrels a day -- nearly double the formal quota.   Oil ministers previously decided they could safely ignorea certain amount of such &quot;cheating,&quot; and factored some intotheir first-half ceiling. The reasoning was that because someother countries couldn't produce all they were officiallypermitted, net production would still only be around 22.6million barrels a day. In view of rising demand for OPEC oil,they figured, prices would remain firm.   Now, some of the ministers said, OPEC needs to get back toits projected level. Output of 22 million barrels a day &quot;willbe very right,&quot; said Fawzi A. Shakshuki, Libya's oilminister. Others suggested cuts to a level even below theceiling. Asked if he still wants a reduction of two millionbarrels a day, Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oilminister, replied: &quot;We are definitely looking for a cut.&quot;   Most outside experts here to track the meeting, includingoil executives who are in Geneva to talk with some of theproducers, seemed confident that the ministers will strike abargain, simply because they must if they want to head offfurther price erosion. &quot;If they walk out of here without anagreement, it's $2 to $4 down&quot; a barrel for oil prices,predicted Oscar Wyatt, chairman of Coastal Corp. The marketcan't absorb continued high output right now, he explained.&quot;Everybody's storage is full.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
