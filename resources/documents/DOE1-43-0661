This report reviewsCanada's contributions to the emissions of CO/sub 2/ from fossil fuelcombustion, and compares, those with the United States, other OECD countries,and the rest of the world. The analysis covers as much of the post-warperiod as possible and lists emissions by energy source and by end uses.Biomass (wood, etc) was excluded because of the CO/sub 2/ recycling natureof this fuel. For Canada the statistics are presented for the countryas a whole and for five regions. The end uses are broken down into transportation,residential and farm, commercial, industrial, electricity, and projectionsfor 1990 and 2000 were prepared on the basis of scenarios provided byEnergy, Mines and Resources Canada (National Energy Program - Update1982). The report starts with a description of conclusions, showing keycomparisons for key years. The second section of the main report providesall relevant information in the form of tables, charts and graphs withoutfurther explanatory notes. An appendix includes two calculations thatwere not part of the main analysis. The first is a high scenario optionwhereby nuclear power generation is replaced by coal-fired generation.The second calculation compares carbon emissions from nonenergy sources.31 refs., 5 figs., 18 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
