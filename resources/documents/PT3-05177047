The catalyst contains Group VIB and Group      VIII metals or metal compounds on a support comprising alumina wherein the      support has 70 volume percent of its pore volume in pores having a      diameter of between 70 and 130 .ANG.. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of a catalyst      carrier, to a hydrocarbon desulfurization catalyst prepared using the      carrier, and to a process for hydrodesulfurizing a hydrocarbon feedstock      using the aforementioned catalyst. More particularly, it relates to a      method for the preparation of a porous catalyst substantially free of      macropores (those having diameters above 1000 .ANG.), and containing at      least one metal and/or metal compound of Groups VIB and VIII of the      elements. Still more particularly, it relates to a catalyst which      comprises a predominantly alumina carrier component which is substantially      free of macropores, has a particular micropore size distribution, and      contains the aforementioned metal and/or metal compounds. It also relates      to a hydrocarbon hydrodesulfurization process using the catalyst. </PAR><PAR>  The pressing need for desulfurizing hydrocarbon oils obtained from      petroleum processing is well known. When these stocks are combusted as a      fuel in the usual manner, the sulfur present in the hydrocarbon becomes a      serious pollutant of the atmosphere in the form of sulfur oxide gases. </PAR><PAR>  Typical operating conditions for hydrodesulfurization processes include a      reaction zone temperature of 600.degree. F. to 900.degree. F., a pressure      of 200 to 3000 psig, a hydrogen feed rate of 500 to 15000 SCF per barrel      of oil feed, and a catalyst such as nickel or cobalt and molybdenum or      tungsten on a porous refractory support. </PAR><PAR>  A problem which has been recognized in the case of hydrodesulfurization of      heavy oils is that if the heavy oil contains organometallic compounds, the      effective catalyst activity tends to decline relatively rapidly,      particularly when the impurity is more than about 10 to 20 ppm metals such      as dissolved nickel and vanadium. These metallic impurities are said to      deposit on the surface and in the pores of the hydrodesulfurization      catalyst. </PAR><PAR>  An approach to this problem of metals impurity deactivation of      hydrodesulfurization catalyst has been to alter the pore structure of the      catalyst. However, the answer as to what pore structure is best has not      been easily obtained, and in fact there remains a conflict in the answer      suggested by the prior art. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,066,574; 4,113,661; and      4,341,625, hereinafter referred to as Tamm '574, Tamm '661, and Tamm '625,      the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set      forth in ipsis verbis, have discussed the conflict in the art and      suggested a solution. </PAR><PAR>  Tamm's patents disclose that heavy oil feedstocks containing metals,      particularly residuum feedstocks, are hydrodesulfurized using a catalyst      prepared by impregnating Group VIB and Group VIII metals or metal      compounds into a support comprising alumina wherein the support has at      least 70% of its pore volume in pores having a diameter between 80 and 150      .ANG.. An especially outstanding hydrodesulfurization catalyst, in terms      of very low deactivation rate, is attained by using an alumina support of      the above pore size distribution. </PAR><PAR>  In Tamm '661 the catalyst is prepared by taking a predominantly      alpha-alumina monohydrate, sized in the range below 500 microns, and      treating it with a particular amount of monobasic acid. The acid and the      resulting mixture is then at least partially neutralized by admixing with      an aqueous solution of a nitrogen base such as aqueous ammonia. The      solution contains 0.6 to 1.2 equivalents of base per equivalent of acid.      The treated and neutralized product is converted into a catalyst carrier      by shaping as desired, drying, and calcining. Finally, the catalyst      support is impregnated with the aforementioned metals. </PAR><PAR>  It would be advantageous if the catalysts and processes of Tamm '574, '661      and '625 could be improved by imparting greater catalytic activity to the      catalyst over a longer period of time. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  According to the present invention, a process is provided for      hydrodesulfurizing a hydrocarbon feedstock containing metals which      comprises contacting the feedstock under hydrodesulfurization conditions      with a catalyst prepared by impregnating Group VIB and Group VIII metals      or metal compounds into a support comprising alumina wherein the support      has at least 70 volume percent of its pore volume in pores having a      diameter of between 70 and 130 .ANG.. The total pore volume of the support      is in the range of from about 0.5 to about 1 cubic centimeters per gram,      less than 5% of said pore volume is in pores having a diameter above 300      .ANG., and less than 2% of the pore volume is in pores having a diameter      above 1000 .ANG.. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is based on the finding that an unexpectedly active      catalyst is obtained from the small change in pore size distribution. In      another aspect of this invention, the distinctive pore size distribution      is obtained by an improvement in the method of making the catalyst      support. In particular, the support is prepared by: </PAR><PA1>  (a) treating a peptizable particulate solid comprising predominantly      alpha-alumina monohydrate by admixing the solid with an aqueous acidic      solution to a pH in the range of about 3.0 to 4.5; </PA1><PA1>  (b) neutralizing at least a portion of the admixed acid by admixing into      the treated solid an aqueous solution of a nitrogen base containing an      amount of base in the range of from about 0.2 to 0.5 equivalents per      equivalent of said acid; </PA1><PA1>  (c) shaping the neutralized or partially neutralized solid; and </PA1><PA1>  (d) completing the support by drying and calcining the shaped solid at a      temperature in the range of about 150.degree. F. to 1700.degree. F. </PA1><PAR>  In another aspect of this invention, the back-neutralization is decreased      in number of nitrogen base equivalents of peptizing acid, and the      calcination temperature is reduced, in comparison with Tamm '661, to      produce a smaller pore catalyst which is more active for resid conversion,      than the catalyst of the prior art. The catalyst of the present invention      produces a vacuum gas oil of superior quality, i.e., lower nitrogen. It is      particularly useful with feedstocks of comparatively lower metals content. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows the pore diameter distribution of the catalyst of the present      invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows the pore diameter distribution of a prior art catalyst. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows the reactor temperature required to do 55% microcarbon residue      (MCR) conversion at 0.35 liquid hourly space velocity feed rate of      760.degree.

Residua typically      have greater than 10 ppm metals, whereas gas-oils nearly always have less      than 10 ppm metals content. Thus, typical feedstocks for the present      invention are crude oil atmospheric distillation column bottoms (reduced      crude oil or atmospheric column residuum), or vacuum distillation column      bottoms (vacuum residua). The metals are believed to be present as      organometallic compounds, possibly in porphyrin or chelate-type      structures, but the concentrations of metals referred to herein is      calculated as parts per million pure metal. </PAR><PAR>  Alumina is the preferred support material of the catalyst used in the      process of the present invention, although alumina may be combined with      other refractory support materials such as silica or magnesia. </PAR><PAR>  The alpha-alumina monohydrate preferably used in the present invention is      available from a variety of commercial sources, such as Catapal or Versal.      It may also be prepared as described in Tamm '661 . </PAR><PAR>  The support material comprising alumina must have the previously mentioned      pore size distribution to give a catalyst in accordance with the      requirements of the present invention. The pore size distribution for the      alumina support used to form the finished catalyst is substantially      similar to the finished catalyst pore size distribution since there is      little change in pore size distribution upon impregnating the support with      Group VIB and Group VIII metal compounds. Relatively pure alumina is      available from several sources as spray-dried, amorphous or crystalline      hydrate powders. These materials are suitable for extrusion when mixed      with water only after the addition of an extrusion aid. Two commonly used      aids are a strong mineral acid or a combustible organic lubricant. The      former usually leads to high density extrudates and the latter leads to      pore size distributions containing substantial micropore volume, neither      of which is acceptable in a residuum desulfurization catalyst support in      accordance with the present invention. The patents of Tamm, previously      incorporated herein, disclose a procedure by which such a material can be      used to obtain a moderate to low density alumina having greater than 97%,      usually greater than 99%, of its pore volume in the micropore region. That      is in the region of pore diameters less than about 500 .ANG.. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention the process of the Tamm patents is improved by a      specific method of manufacture improvement which shifts the pore size      distribution from 70% of the pore volume in pores having a diameter of      between 80 and 150 .ANG. to a pore size distribution in which 70% of the      pore volume is in pores having a diameter of between 70 and 130.ANG.. As      pointed out in Tamm '661, the acid treated particulate solid alumina      monohydrate is partially neutralized by admixing into the treated solid an      aqueous solution of nitrogen base containing an amount of base in the      range of from about 0.6 to 1.2 equivalents per equivalent of previously      added acid. This process is sometimes known as &quot;back-titration&quot;. It is an      aspect of the present invention that the back-titration is carried out      with a solution of nitrogen base, containing an amount of base in the      range of from about 0.2 to 0.5 equivalents per equivalent of said      previously added acid. </PAR><PAR>  In order to produce an alumina support or carrier having a pore size      distribution in accordance with that required by the present invention,      the alumina must be treated with a suitable monobasic acid, preferably      nitric acid, or its equivalent, as heretofore described (Tamm '661), e.g.,      hydrochloric, hydrofluoric and hydrobromic acids. </PAR><PAR>  As was recognized the acid treated alumina is satisfactory for the      production of a finished carrier substantially free of macropores.      However, it is not satisfactory for the production of a catalyst carrier      with appropriate pore volume for use in the preparation of residuum      desulfurization catalyst. A satisfactory residuum desulfurization catalyst      carrier and catalyst should have a pore volume of at least about 0.5      cc/gm, preferably at least 0.65 cc/gm. In general, the higher the pore      volume, provided that the micropore distribution and macropore content are      satisfactory, the longer is the catalyst life. In order to achieve a      useful pore volume and to provide a suitable micropore distribution as      required for the finished carrier and catalyst, an appreciable fraction of      the admixed acid in the treated feed must be neutralized with a nitrogen      base which has been thoroughly admixed into the feed by intensive mixing. </PAR><PAR>  By &quot;nitrogen base&quot; as used herein is meant a base of the formula: R.sub.3 N      and the corresponding hydroxide form, R.sub.3 HNOH, wherein the R groups      are the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of      hydrogen and of alkyl groups having a carbon atom content in the range of      from 1 to 3, inclusive. Aqueous ammonia is preferred. </PAR><PAR>  The prior art recommends that &quot;ordinarily, for each equivalent of the acid      employed in the treatment, at least about 0.6 equivalent of the base is      required&quot;. The prior art contends that the use of a large relative amount      of the base for neutralization is increasingly beneficial up to a point.      Thereafter, the use of a larger relative amount is undesirable. According      to Tamm '661 excellent results in terms of the finished carrier are      obtained, in general, when the relative amount of the base in the aqueous      solution per equivalent of the acid is in the range of about 0.6 to 1.2      equivalents, and when this ratio is about 1.6, the resulting carrier is      usually unsatisfactory. </PAR><PAR>  It is the finding of the present invention, that for an improved high      activity resid catalyst, the relative amount of the base in the aqueous      neutralization solution per equivalent of the acid should be in the range      from about 0.2 to 0.5 equivalents, preferably more than about 0.35      equivalents per equivalent of acid. </PAR><PAR>  The nature of the mixture resulting from the neutralization of the treated      alumina varies, depending upon its volatiles content. It may be a flowable      solid or a viscous paste. In the preferred form required for use as an      extrusion feed, it is a flowable solid having a volatiles content in the      range of from 50 to 70 wt. %. The term &quot;volatile&quot; as used herein is the      material evolved during the high temperature .gtoreq. 900.degree. F.      drying. A variety of shaping methods may be employed for forming the      precursor of the catalyst carrier from the treated and neutralized solid.      Preferably, the shaping is affected by extruding. In the production of the      finished carrier, drying and calcining steps of the present method are in      general carried out at temperatures in the range from about 150.degree. F.      to 1700.degree. F., preferably in the range of 1050.degree. F. to      1700.degree. F. The drying step is typically carried out in the range of      from about 150.degree. F. to 500.degree. F. and following the drying the      calcination is carried out in a dry or humid atmosphere at a temperature      in the range of from about 500.degree. F. to 1700.degree. F., preferably      1050.degree. F. to 1700.degree. F., most preferably less than 1400.degree.      F. </PAR><PAR>  The present method results in the production of moderate to low density,      predominantly alumina, catalyst carriers having preferably greater than      about 98% of their pore volume in the micropore region; and in particular,      having at least 70% of the total pore volume in pores having a pore      diameter in the range between 70 and 130 .ANG., less than 5% of the total      pore volume in pores having a diameter above 300 .ANG., and less than 2%      of pores having a pore diameter above 1000 .ANG.. Table I presents a      typical distribution of the pore volume among the pore diameters in a      prior art catalyst described by Tamm '661, '574, and '625. Table II      presents a typical pore volume distribution amongst the pore diameters of      a catalyst of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Pore volume as described here is the volume of a liquid which is adsorbed      into the pore structure of the sample at saturation vapor pressure,      assuming that the adsorbed liquid has the same density as the bulk density      of the liquid. The liquid used for this analysis was liquid nitrogen. The      procedure for measuring pore volumes by nitrogen physisorption is further      laid out in D. H. Everett and F. S.

The metals and/or the compounds of the      metals, particularly the sulfides and oxides of Group VIB (especially      molybdenum and tungsten) and Group VIII (especially cobalt and nickel) of      the elements are in general satisfactory catalytic agents, and are      contemplated for use with substantially macropore-free carriers produced      by the method of the present invention. The combinations of cobalt, nickel      and molybdenum catalytic agents are preferred. </PAR><PAR>  The catalytic agents required for the present catalyst compositions may be      incorporated into the calcined carrier by any suitable method,      particularly by impregnation procedures ordinarily employed in general in      the catalyst preparation art. It has been found that an especially      outstanding catalyst is made when the alumina used not only has the pore      size distribution required in accordance with the present invention, but      also wherein the catalyst is made by a single step impregnation of the      alumina using a solution of a cobalt or nickel salt and a      heteropolymolybdic acid, for example, phosphomolybdic acid. </PAR><PAR>  The following examples illustrate the preparation of the catalyst of the      present invention. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLES </PAC><PAC>  Example A </PAC><PAC>  Preparation of the Catalyst Support </PAC><PAR>  An alumina feedstock consisting of 60% Catapal alumina and 40% Versal 250      alumina was peptized with 7.6% nitric acid, and back-neutralized with 35%      ammonium hydroxide, 63% volatiles by weight were present. Specifically,      1260 gms of Catapal and 840 gms of Versal on a volatiles-free basis were      maintained at a temperature between 130.degree. F. and 140.degree. F.,      mixed together with 228 gms of concentrated nitric acid and 1515 gms of      deionized water at about 150 cc/min. in a blender for 15 minutes or until      pasty. Twenty (20) gms of the paste was slurried in 80 cc of deionized      water and the pH recorded as 3.4. Fifty-five (55) gms of concentrated      ammonium hydroxide (58 wt. % ammonia hydroxide), was mixed with 1145 gms      of deionized water and added to the mixer at the rate of about 150 cc/min.      and then mixed for an additional 15 minutes. The volatiles content was      61.9 wt. %. The paste temperature was 133.degree. F. The paste was      extruded in a two-inch extruder, using a 0.039.inch cylindrical die. The      extrudate was air-dried and heated in an oven at 250.degree.  F. for two      hours. Then heated at 400.degree. F. for two additional hours. The weight      recovered was 2,345.5 gms. The dried extrudate was calcined for one hour      at 1400.degree. F. and an air rate of 1 cubic foot per hour of dry air.      The finished particles had the following properties. Particle diameter:      0.0318&quot;; particle density: 1.056 gms/cc; total pore volume: 0.6188 cc/gm;      surface area: 185 m.sup.2 /gm. This support material was then impregnated      with nickel and molybdenum in the following manner. A mixture of      molybdenum oxide dissolved in ammonium was acidified with phosphoric acid      to a pH of 2.8, and nickel nitrate hexahydrate was added. The support was      impregnated with the mixture to make the catalyst. The catalyst was dried      at 250.degree. F. for two hours and at 400.degree. F. for six hours. It      was then calcined with 20 cubic feet per hour of dry air for four hours at      450.degree. F., four hours at 750.degree. F. and five hours at 950.degree.       F. The finished catalyst contained 8.62 wt. % molybdenum, 3.16 wt. %      nickel, and 1.93 wt. % phosphorous. The median pore diameter was 111 .ANG.      which is smaller than the prior art catalyst. The surface area was 159      m.sup.2 /gm. See FIG. 1. </PAR><PAC>  Example B </PAC><PAR>  The catalyst of Example A was compared with the analogously prepared      catalyst of the prior art (see Table I and FIG. 2--Tamm '574, '625, '661)      in a standard activity test. In this test, the conversion catalyst was      charged to a reactor under a layer of standard commercial demetallation      catalyst, and both catalysts were presulfided using dimethyl disulfide.      They were then contacted with a 760.degree. F.andplus; Arabian Heavy residuum at      0.35 LHSV and 2000 psi total pressure and with a 5000 SCF/bbl once-through      hydrogen flow. The layered catalyst system was tested at a range of      temperatures between 700.degree. F. and 750.degree. F. and at a range of      feed rates between 0.35 hr.sup.-1 LHSV and 0.50 hr.sup.-1 LHSV over 750      hours. Liquid product stripped of light gas from the reaction was tested      for microcarbon residue (MCR) as defined by ASTM D4530-85. FIG. 3 shows      the calculated temperature required to maintain 55% MCR conversion.      According to the results shown in FIG. 3, the catalyst of this invention      was significantly more active than the reference catalyst, as shown by the      lower reactor temperature required to maintain the target MCR conversion. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
