Bush told Barco on Thursday that the United States wantsColombia to get sufficient economic aid as his embattled governmentfaces up to drug traffickers who have declared all out war, WhiteHouse press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.   Barco saw Bush at the White House before traveling to New Yorkto address the United Nations today.   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills will head an ``interagencyeffort to examine urgently what can be done'' on trade relations toboost U.S. benefits to Colombia, particularly with agricultural andmanufactured items, Fitzwater said in a written statement.   Bush also told Barco the United States will ``work with theinternational financial institutions to support increased economicassistance for Colombia,'' the statement said.   Bush wants to resolve ``fundamental problems'' with thenow-defunct International Coffee Agreement that led him last weekto turn down Barco's request for an extension of that pact tobenefit Colombian coffee growers, Fitzwater said.   At a photo session in the Rose Garden before their 1{-hourmeeting, Barco told reporters he was not seeking any more U.S.military aid beyond the $65 million package Bush ordered thissummer.   ``We are not asking for more assistance. We have received ...help with our problem,'' he said without elaboration.   Fitzwater said Bush told Barco he would encourage othercountries to support Colombia's efforts against the cocaine cartels.   In August, Bush ordered the Pentagon to sent $65 million inmilitary equipment, weapons and supplies to help Colombian securityforces. Bush is requesting some $90 million more from Congress forthe next fiscal year.   Some Colombian officials have criticized the aid package as notsuited to their needs. They said they need police equipment totrack down the traffickers, while the U.S. aid is primarilymilitary equipment such as helicopters and other troop transportvehicles.   Joining Bush for the meeting with Barco were Bush's top drugpolicy advisers: drug policy coordinator William Bennett, AttorneyGen. Dick Thornburgh, chief of staff John Sununu, Deputy Secretaryof State Lawrence Eagleburger, and national security adviser BrentScowcroft.   Barco also met Thursday with Bennett under tight security at theColombian ambassador's residence.   Administration officials previously have said Bush is willing todiscuss the coffee import matter, even as he turned down Barco'srequest to reinstate an export quota system that helped Colombiancoffee growers.   ``The president indicated his intention to work closely withPresident Barco to expand bilateral trade and investmentopportunities in order to spur Colombia's economic growth,''Fitzwater said.   Colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74-nationInternational Coffee Agreement collapsed in July after the UnitedStates pulled out in a price dispute with coffee-producing nations.The agreement had set quotas for member nations' exports aimed atsupporting prices of beans at $1.20 per pound or more. The UnitedStates wanted an increase in export quotas for higher-qualitycoffees enjoyed by U.S. consumers.   Colombian officials have suggested it will be difficult toconvince farmers to grow coffee instead of coca, for lucrativecocaine production, if coffee export prices continue to slip.   Bush, in a letter to Barco last week, said the United States wasready to negotiate for a new quota system but would not adhere tothe now-defunct agreement.   Barco's visit to the United States came against a backdrop ofalmost daily terrorist bombings attributed to drug lords in hiscountry. Since Barco ordered emergency measures to crack down onthe drug traffickers following the Aug. 18 assassination of aleading presidential candidate, police say eight people have beenkilled and 37 injured in the widespread explosions.   Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have beenkilled in attacks believed carried out by drug traffickers.</TEXT></DOC>
