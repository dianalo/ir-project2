The approximately 60,000 strikers, including teachers, hospitalemployees and transportation workers, demand pay increases of about10 percent. Their average monthly salary now is about $500.   They also want the government to resume severance payments. Inthe past two years, the government has fired about 5,000 employees.Union officials said the dismissals appear politically motivated andare continuing.   Striking hospital workers said they would handle only emergencycases.   The government said employees who do not show up at work Thursdaywill not be paid. Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe Labor Ministry probably will declare the strike illegal.   The strike began at 7 a.m. and kept Azcona Hoyo in an emergencyCabinet meeting most of the day.   Obdulio Chevez, president of the Association of Public Employees,said the strike will continue until the government agrees to salaryand job stability demands.   For 1{ years, Congress has held up a proposed law that includeseconomic and social benefits for government workers, Chevez said.
