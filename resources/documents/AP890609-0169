In Hong Kong, legislators said Friday that London's policy ofallowing only some Hong Kong citizens the right to emigrate toBritain is ``no longer adequate.''   With boat people arriving at a record rate of 500 a day, ``publicopinion in Hong Kong is very frustrated,'' said Geoffrey Barnes, thecolony's British secretary of security. ``They see no end to it.Hong Kong has had enough.   ``We believe ... that mandatory repatriation of all non-refugeesis a logical and essential consequence of screening,'' he said at anews conference.   Hong Kong has 42,766 Vietnamese boat people, one third of whomarrived this year. Barnes said all but 14,150 were categorized assimply seeking a better way of life, as opposed to being politicalrefugees.   The British government said Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howewill visit Hong Kong early next month in an attempt to restoreconfidence.   Aides said that, among other things, Howe will discuss arelaxation of emigration rules to give a greater number of the 3.2million Hong Kong Chinese with British passports the right toemigrate to Britain.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher this week ruled out an open-doorpolicy but promised greater flexibility, particularly for publicservants and people with private incomes.   British newspapers reported that all 180,000 Hong Kong civilservants and up to 50,000 retired civil servants and businessmen andtheir families will be given the right to come to Britain.   But Hong Kong legislators said increased flexibility ``is nolonger adequate.''   ``Britain has a fundamental moral duty to extend the right toabode to all the British nationals in Hong Kong,'' said a statementby the lawmakers.   The declaration came a day after Mrs. Thatcher rejected a similarappeal by Hong Kong Governor Sir David Wilson during an emergencymeeting in London.   The crackdown in China on pro-democracy students has increasedfears China will renege on an agreement to preserve Hong Kong'scapitalist system for 50 years after it takes over the territory,now an important financial center.   Britain is now simply hoping that the aging hard-liners now incharge in Beijing will be gone before 1997 and that China will wantto keep Hong Kong capitalist for its own benefit.   ``Economic self-interest will surely reassert itself'' in China,British Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said Friday in anaddress to a Hong Kong Chinese group in London. But he added:``These are dark and still early days. I have for you ... no easyreassurances.''   A conference in Geneva next week on refugees, to be attended byUnited Nations representatives and Southeast Asian countries, isexpected to agree on tough screening procedures for boat people butstop short of forced repatriation.</TEXT></DOC>
