Both the Swiss-based Nestle SA and American Home Products Corp.responded quickly Tuesday when Action for Corporate Accountabilityannounced it was renewing a boycott against Nestle products andextending it to American Home Products.   Leaders of the Minnesota-based group engineered a seven-yearboycott against Nestle that ended in 1984 when the company agreedto an infant formula marketing code worked out with the WorldHealth Organization and UNICEF, an arm of the United Nations.   Boycott leaders said they were renewing their call for themarketplace action because Nestle and American Home Products werenot abiding by the agreement.   ``Nestle has worked diligently to ensure its marketing policiesfollow WHO recommendations,'' company spokesman Thad M. Jacksonsaid in Washington. He said the guidelines allow companies toprovide free or reduced-price formula to hospitals in Third Worldnations for babies who ``have to be fed breast-milk substitutes.''   Carol Emerling, a spokewoman for American Home Products, said,``This whole activity is based on allegations that we violate theWHO code _ and we flat out deny it.   ``The real issue is infant health,'' she said. ``Breast-feedingis best for infants; we've always said that. But every infant whois not receiving breast milk has the right to the best alternativeavailable. That alternative is a scientifically formulated infantformula that is as close to breast milk as man can make it. Andthat is what our infant formula products are.''   Boycott leader Douglas A. Johnson, chairman of Action forCorporate Accountability, contended at a news conference thatNestle and American Home Products and _ to a lesser degree _ otherformula distributors are interpreting the guidelines in a way thatallows them to skirt the intent and encourage mothers who couldbreast feed their babies to use formula instead.   Although Johnson does not have a blanket objection to usinginfant formula, he maintains it is wrong for manufacturers toencourage its use in powdered form in Third World countries wheremost mothers typically don't have the money, education and sanitaryfacilities to mix it properly.   The result, he argues, is that thousands of Third World babiesdevelop often fatal diseases because they drink from bottles withunderstrength formula that either does not give them the nutrientsthey need or infects them with various germs, or both.   The fundamental issue is whether formula distributorseffectively get babies and their mothers hooked on formula withindays of birth by making their product available for freedistribution at hospitals and other birthing facilities.   ``In the hands of the poor, the feeding-bottle often becomes apassport to death for the young child,'' said Dr. R.K. Anand, apediatrician from Bombay, India, present at the news conference.   The physician said his practice has convinced him of threethings: ``Bottle feeding continues to kill a large number of babiesin India and other developing countries. Even poor mothers canproduce enough breastmilk for their babies for at least the firstfour months of life. Restraint on the aggressive marketing ofinfant formula is essential.   ``Otherwise,'' said Anand, ``more and more babies will bedisplaced from their mother's breast by big business.''   Janice Mantell, executive director of Action for CorporateAccountability, estimated that about $6 billion in infant formulais sold worldwide each year, half of it in developing countries.She estimated Nestle has 40 percent to 50 percent of the market inthe Third World and American Home Products about 20 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
