Forthe improvement of a transmission efficiency and quality and a cost benefitfor the power supply communication, the introduction of digital networkshas been promoted. As for a protection information network, since thereis the difference between a required communication quality of systemprotection information and that of power supply operation information,the individual digital network configuration is expected, in addition,the increasing of image information transmission for monitoring is alsoestimated. As for a business information network, the construction ofa broad-band switched network is expected with increasing of image transmissionneeds such as a television meeting. Furthermore, the expansion to a powersupply ISDN which is possible to connect between a telephone, facsimileand data terminal, to exchange various media and to connect between networksis expected with higher communication services in the protection andbusiness network. However, for its practical use, the standardizationof various interfaces will become essential. (3 figs, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
