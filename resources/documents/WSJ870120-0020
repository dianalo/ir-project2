As the brass band strikes up a catchy German tune from the 1920s, he grins and strides jauntily into the back of the packed hall. He winds his way through the rhythmically clapping crowd toward the podium, shaking hands and greeting familiar faces from Ludwigshafen, the town where he was born and once worked.    As he starts to address the 4,500-strong audience, the carnival-like atmosphere is drowned out by whistles from young hecklers high up on his left. But Ludwigshafen's favorite son barely glances at them as he launches into his standard 100-minute campaign speech.    &quot;We won't be put off,&quot; shouts the head of West Germany's Christian Democratic Union above the din. &quot;This is our rally, and they'll have to play by our rules.&quot;    Mr. Kohl, 56 years old, is as confident these days as the national mood. A few days before Sunday's West German election, the conservative chancellor and his coalition colleagues, sensing victory, are giving no ground to critics, domestic or foreign.    Whether it's Ludwigshafen hecklers, U.S. officials calling for Bonn to stimulate the economy or Soviets complaining about insulting references to Mikhail Gorbachev, the official dismissive message is: You'll have to play by German rules. The election campaign may be flat, but the country is buoyant and the government is feeling self-satisfied, if not downright smug.    The contentment of Mr. Kohl and his colleagues is reflected among the population at large. Inflation has been beaten, the German mark is strong and getting stronger. Political and economic stability seem assured, and although the unemployment rate is 9%, not many people get worked up about it.    It's true that everything isn't coming up roses, but almost 60% of West Germans feel generally optimistic about their future, according to the Allensbach polling institute, up from 45% in 1983 when Mr. Kohl took office. Even among supporters of the left-wing Greens party, who make up the most angst-ridden section of the population, hopes far outweigh worries. The pessimism associated with the German national character &quot;now is a thing of the past,&quot; Allensbach concludes.    This shift increasingly has been accompanied by a German feeling toward others of &quot;don't blame us for your problems.&quot; An illustration was the German attitude toward the recent crisis in the European Monetary System, which prompted accusations about Bonn's &quot;egotistical&quot; behavior from French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac.    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg insisted that &quot;there was no economic reason&quot; to revalue the mark, even though Mr. Chirac contended that the falling dollar had caused &quot;a mark crisis and not a franc crisis.&quot; While European central banks were spending billions of dollars to defend the system, Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German central bank, carried on skiing in Switzerland.    And, after agreement on the realignment was reached, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper published an open letter to the French people, headlined Dear Francois, that declared, &quot;The truth of the matter is that we've simply been better than you.&quot;    The blunt tones from Bonn have angered those snubbed and raised worries about German arrogance. Willy Brandt, chairman of West Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party, talks darkly about a &quot;dangerous radicalization&quot; that could undermine Bonn's relations with other countries.    Though convinced of an election victory, not all caution has been cast aside. Some of Mr. Kohl's election managers fret that freezing winter weather could keep government supporters home on election day. But few quibble with Franz Josef Strauss, the powerful governor of Bavaria and leader of the ruling party's Christian Social Union sister party, who declared a few days ago that the opposition &quot;doesn't have the slightest chance of winning.&quot;    Government supporters and opponents say the party's smugness can be traced to Mr. Kohl's own personality and style. Unlike his intellectual and comparatively austere predecessor, Helmut Schmidt, Mr. Kohl revels in middle-class comforts and advocates traditional values such as family and home. He savors good Italian food and likes the fruity white wines from the Rhineland-Palatinate, his home region. &quot;Schmidt only served Coca-Cola,&quot; one Social Democratic official remembers glumly.    Many West German voters find Mr. Kohl's style appealing, pollsters say, because they see in it a reflection of themselves. Questioned at the Ludwigshafen rally, one rotund, middle-aged local conceded that &quot;perhaps he is a little too sure of himself.&quot; But, he added, &quot;he's one of us, and we're known for being solid and sitting things out.&quot;    Indeed, Mr. Kohl's time in office has been characterized by a dogged ability to ride out storms. Unlike some heads of government, he has gone out of his way to avoid shuffling his cabinet. When colleagues are involved in embarrassing scandals, such as Defense Minister Manfred Woerner's sacking of a supposedly homosexual general, he defends them and often seeks to lay the blame elsewhere.    Mr. Kohl's natural confidence, coupled with efforts to woo his party's right wing, has led him to attack the Soviet bloc. He has all but ignored domestic and international condemnation when he compared Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Hitler's propaganda chief, Josef Goebbels, or East German prisons to concentration camps. Feeling secure, he and some colleagues even have started to talk about Germany's Nazi past as something a modern democracy should put behind it.    These incidents, which some see as gaffes, don't seem to have hurt his reelection chances. The sentiment behind them may even have struck a chord among voters. At the Ludwigshafen rally, he won sustained applause for condemning human-rights abuses in East Germany only days after his controversial concentration camp remark.    But it is in economic matters that Mr. Kohl and his colleagues have displayed the greatest self-assurance and tenacity, rejecting criticism in an often impatient or petulant manner.    When the U.S. and others last year urged Germany to cut interest rates to boost domestic growth and give a new impetus to world trade, officials in Bonn and Frankfurt dismissed the calls as being &quot;misinformed&quot; about the German economy. When asked about the effect of the U.S. dollar's plunge against the mark, Mr. Stoltenberg, the finance minister, replied with a smirk: &quot;The devaluation of one's currency is always a defeat for a country.
