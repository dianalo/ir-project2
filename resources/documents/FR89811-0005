Background </ITAG>A. General Section 5(c)(4)(B) of the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933, 12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(4)(B),provides that a Federal association may invest up to three percent of itsassets in a corporation chartered in the state where the association hasits home office, provided that at least one-half of the investments inexcess of one percent are for community development purposes. The Boardhas implemented this authority in 12 CFR 545.74, which authorizes Federalassociations to invest in various types of ``service corporation'' subsidiaries.The Board considers service corporations an important adjunct to traditionalassociation activities and recognizes that they can make significant profitcontributions. The Board also seeks to ensure, however, that associationsconduct activities in ways that do not entail undue risk to institutionalsafety and soundness and that do not result in financial loss or damageto the reputation of insured institutions. In recent years, the Board has received numerous applications for servicecorporations to conduct different types of securities brokerage activities.The application process for these filings entails review by the SupervisoryAgent at the District Bank; transmittal to and review by the Board's Officeof District Banks, Office of General Counsel, and Office of RegulatoryActivities; and submission to the Board. The staff has noted that while certain applications raise legal and/orsafety and soundness concerns or present unusual or problematic facts,many applications present similar facts and seek permission to conductactivities structured in a way that either does not raise legal or supervisoryconcerns or that raise concerns that can be and have been addressed bythe Board, <T3>e.g.,</T3> by imposing conditions on the approvals, or by limitingthe scope of the activity approved. The Board is sensitive to the importance of expediting the processing andreview of applications in the minimum time period necessary to satisfythe Board's interests in assuring the safety, soundness, and legality ofa proposed service corporation activity. As a result of this concern, theBoard has in the past delegated authority to the Supervisory Agents ofthe Board at the District Banks to approve certain applications which aremodelled upon those previously approved by the Board. In these cases, theSA reviews the documents, analyzes the materiality of any differences betweenthe application approved by the Board, and (if there are no material differences)may approve the application subject to the conditions that the Board hasspecified. B. Summary of the Current Proposal The Board proposed amendments to 12 CFR 545.74(c) in Board Resolution No.89-1044 (March 28, 1989), published at 54 FR 14091 (April 7, 1989) (``CurrentProposal''). Section 545.74(c) lists activities in which service corporationsmay engage without prior approval. The Current Proposal would add certainsecurities brokerage activities to those that are preapproved, creatinga new paragraph (c)(4), ``Securities brokerage activities,'' which includescertain securities brokerage and investment advisory services, and makecorresponding technical changes. Section 545.74(c)(4), as proposed, sets forth requirements relating tothe manner in which the preapproved service corporation brokerage activitiescould be conducted. These are contained in two paragraphs: (i) (A)-(E),relating to the manner in which the business is conducted, and paragraphs(ii) (A)-(G), identifying activities in which the service corporation mayengage only with express Board approval. Paragraph (i) states, essentially,that the preapproved service corporation must offer securities servicesin a separated area, provide proper supervision to prevent and cure violationsof securities regulations, advertise as an independent entity, be indemnified,along with the parent association, in appropriate respects by the broker-dealer,and not condition the provision of brokerage services on the use of anyservices of affiliated entities. 12 CFR 545.74(c)(4)(ii) specifies thatthe preapproval does not apply where a service corporation seeks to makemarkets in, underwrite, and engage in certain other securities activities;if association employees receive payments for referring association customersto the broker-dealer absent a ``no-action'' letter from the U.S. Securitiesand Exchange Commission (``SEC''); to solicitation of transactions in particularsecurities; to provision of certain indemnifications; to extension of margincredit by the parent association; to contracts directly between an associationand a broker-dealer; and if the association has non-registered personsperforming other than ministerial or clerical tasks. The Current Proposal also delegates to the Office of District Banks, withthe concurrence of the Office of General Counsel, the authority to approveservice corporation applications that do not raise a significant issueof law or policy or would not establish a precedent of national significance.This delegation provision applies to all types of service corporation applications.The Current Proposal is a revision of the Board's earlier proposed amendmentsto 12 CFR 545.74(c), set forth in Board Resolution No. 88-303 (April 28,1988) and published at 53 FR 16147 (May 5, 1988) (``First Proposal'').The First Proposal consisted of many of the provisions of the Current Proposalexcept for the delegation to the Office of District Banks and certain otherrequirements. For example, andSection; 545.74(c)(4)(i) of the First Proposalincluded as additional requirements: A certification that the associationand service corporation were separate corporate entities; a projectionthat the service corporation would receive a profit within the upcomingtwelve-month period; a prohibition on the dissemination of associationcustomers' account balances and deposit maturity dates to service corporationsand to broker-dealers engaged in joint ventures with the service corporations(``joint-venture broker-dealers''); and disclosure of whether a joint-venturebroker-dealer had been sanctioned by a court, governmental agency, or self-regulatoryorganization for securities violations. Section 545.74(c)(4)(ii) of theFirst Proposal contained essentially the same prohibitions as in the CurrentProposal as well as a few additional ones. These included requiring Boardapproval for certain investment advisory services, all referral fees, andcertain indemnification arrangements. The Board is not adopting these provisionsof the First Proposal for reasons set forth at 54 FR 14093-14095. C. Summary of Comments In response to the proposal, the Board received four public comments, includingone from a federal association, two from broker-dealers, and one from anindustry association. The federal association commented on the limitationon soliciting transactions in particular securities and recommended thatthe provision exempt solicitations of general investment advice and solicitationsto institutional investors. The broker-dealers objected to the requirementof obtaining an SEC no-action letter in order to pay referral fees andto the limitations on the soliciting transactions in specific securities.They also requested clarification of the indemnification restriction andof the process for associations seeking approval pursuant to existing delegations.These points are discussed in context below. The industry association notedthat the Current Proposal incorporated comments made to the First Proposaland had no further comments other than to request speedy adoption. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Amendments to the Service Corporation Regulations </ITAG>A. Overview Under the amendments, the types of securities brokerage and investmentadvice activities that the Board has routinely approved on a case-by-casebasis now are approved under a preapproval procedure. For example, an associationmay invest in a service corporation that executes transactions in securitieson an agency or ``riskless principal'' basis under the preapproval. Inaddition, to qualify for preapproval, brokerage services must be providedin areas clearly identified and distinguished from the areas in which theassociation conducts its depository activities. The advertisements forthe services also must distinguish the service corporation from the insuredinstitution in order to minimize the opportunities for investor confusionbetween federally-insured savings accounts and stocks and other securitiesthat are not federally-insured. These amendments do not preapprove other securities activities not describedin the new preapproval provisions, such as making a market in securities,underwriting stocks and bonds, and investment banking. The Board has in the past approved on a case-by-case basis applicationsto provide various types of investment advice to individuals and certaininstitutions. The Board has no evidence that these activities have notbeen carried on responsibly and, accordingly, believes it appropriate alsoto preapprove such financial advisory services. B. Description of Amendment Subsections The requirements for the preapproval under the new amendments are as follows:1. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(i)(A). </T3>The service corporation must conductits securities brokerage and investment advisory services in an area thatmaintains a distinction in the minds of association customers between federally-insureddeposits and non-insured securities products and services and that appropriatelyreflects the separate corporate identities of the Federal association andthe service corporation. 2. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(i)(B). </T3>Any advertising of the service corporation'ssecurities brokerage or investment advisory services must be distinguishablefrom that of the association and not indicate or imply that the securitiessold or transactions executed by the service corporation are federally-insureddeposits. Advertisements must indicate that it is the service corporationand the broker-dealer, and not the association, that is providing the brokerageservices. In order further to prevent customer confusion, the name of thebroker-dealer providing the securities brokerage services must be disclosed,and the logo of the service corporation's parent insured institution maynot be used in the text of any advertisement prepared or distributed bythe service corporation or by the broker-dealer or in any advertisementfor specific securities products. 3. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(i)(C). </T3>A service corporation that contractswith a third-party broker-dealer to provide securities brokerage servicesmust obtain a contractual commitment from the broker-dealer for full indemnificationto the service corporation and to the parent association with respect toliability arising from the negligence, recklessness, or intentional conductof the broker-dealer and its employees. In addition, the service corporation must evidence the contractual agreementwith any broker-dealer with an executed written contract that sets forthoperating, marketing, compensation, and other relevant terms. The Boardis not preapproving activities based upon oral understandings of materialterms. 4. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(i)(D). </T3>The service corporation must fileinitially with the Supervisory Agent an opinion of counsel to the broker-dealeror the senior securities principal that the brokerage program has adequatesupervisory controls and these controls will be applied to detect and preventsecurities regulatory violations. Thereafter, on an annual basis, the seniorsecurities principal must file a certification that he or she has dischargedhis responsibilities under the supervisory system and does not know andhas no reason to know of improper conduct or other regulatory violations.Supervisory systems must exist when operations commence. It is unsatisfactoryto represent that supervisory systems will be implemented or that manualswill be written in the future. 5. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(i)(E). </T3>A service corporation may not predicatethe execution of securities transactions on the customer's use of any safekeepingor other services by the federal association, service corporation, thebroker-dealer, or any of their affiliates. To the extent such arrangementsare legally permissible, they require express Board approval. 6. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(ii)(A). </T3>The service corporation may not executesecurities transactions on a principal basis, except a ``riskless principal''basis, and may not underwrite or make a market in a security within thescope of the preapproved activities.7. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(ii)(B). </T3>The preapproval is applicable whereassociation employees receive referral fees only if the association hasin advance: (1) Obtained a ``no-action'' letter from the SEC to the effectthat the association would not be required to register as a broker-dealerpursuant to Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \1\<NOTE/> and (2) provides advance notice to the Supervisory Agentof the type and amount of referral fees to be paid, together with a copyof the ``no-action'' letter.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requiresany broker or dealer to register prior to conducting any business. Sections3(a)(4) and 3(a)(5) of the Exchange Act define ``broker'' and ``dealer''both to exempt ``banks,'' but do not mention savings and loan associations.The SEC has never interpreted the term ``banks'' in Section 3 to includesavings and loan associations or exempted them from registration. However,the SEC, on a case-by-case basis, has issued ``no-action'' letters permittingsavings and loan associations to conduct brokerage activities through servicecorporation subsidiaries provided that the operations of the subsidiarywere sufficiently separated from those of its parent. 8. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(ii)(C). </T3>To qualify for preapproval, a servicecorporation may not solicit a transaction in a particular security. A servicecorporation may, however, solicit interest in an overall securities orinvestment advisory services program. The service corporation also maymake recommendations in response to a request by an existing customer.Under the new preapproval, transactions may be solicited from institutionalinvestors. 9. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(ii)(D). </T3>A service corporation is permittedto indemnify a third-party broker-dealer to an extent no greater than theextent to which the third-party broker-dealer indemnifies the service corporation,without express Board approval. A service corporation may negotiate toprovide a lower level of indemnification, and many have done so. The associationis prohibited from indemnifying a third-party broker-dealer. 10. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(ii)(E). </T3>The parent Federal association maynot extend margin credit to the customers of the service corporation orthe joint-venture broker-dealer, without express Board approval. 11. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(ii)(F). </T3>To qualify for preapproval, the parentFederal association may not sign or otherwise enter a contract directlywith the third-party broker-dealer. Any contract for brokerage servicesto be performed through a service corporation must be between the servicecorporation and the broker-dealer. It should not include the Federal associationas a signatory or obligate the Federal association. 12. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(ii)(G). </T3>Persons who participate in offeringthe service corporation brokerage services but who are not registered representatives,such as association employees, may perform only clerical or ministerialtasks. Such tasks can include directing inquiring customers to the brokeragekiosk or telephone ``hot line'' to the broker-dealer, filling promotionalpamphlet racks, and distributing forms and publicity related to the securitiesservices. 13. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(4)(iii). </T3>An association intending to investin a service corporation engaging in preapproved securities brokerage activitiesmust send a notice to its Supervisory Agent prior to the commencement ofoperations. The required notice must include a full description of thebrokerage service to be provided and copies of all executed contracts betweenthe service corporation and broker-dealers, investment advisors, and theiraffiliates, and the association, such as the operating agreement with abroker-dealer, a lease for space with the association, and a contract forclerical and ministerial services with the association. If referral feeswill be paid to association employees, the notice should include a no-actionletter from the SEC. The notice should also include pro forma income andexpense statements for the first three years of operations and any requiredprofessional opinions, such as that required pursuant to andSection; 545.74(c)(4)(i)(D).A reasoned legal opinion that the service corporation activities qualifyas preapproved also must accompany the notice. The Board is amending the Current Proposal to require that the notice besubmitted no later than 30 days and no earlier than 180 days prior to thecommencement of operations. Thus, the notice will be filed reasonably closein time to the commencement of operations, in order for the SupervisoryAgent to review the proposed activities in accordance with the contemporarycondition of the insured institution. If a Supervisory Agent receives anotice and six months passes without commencement of the activity, thenotice is deemed withdrawn.14. <T3>Section 545.74(c)(1)(4)(iv). </T3>The Supervisory Agent may requestadditional information at any time regarding the operations of the servicecorporation. The Supervisory Agent also may limit or prohibit activitiesfor supervisory reasons, pursuant to 12 CFR 545.74(b)(5). 15. <T3>Section 545.74(f). </T3>The Board is delegating authority to the Board'sOffice of District Banks (``ODB'') to approve service corporation applicationsfor activities that are not preapproved under andSection; 545.74(c). ODB,with the concurrence of the Board's Office of General Counsel and Officeof Regulatory Activities, is authorized to approve or deny any servicecorporation application that does not present a significant issue of lawor policy. This delegation can further improve the processing of servicecorporation applications, reserving for the Board's attention only thoseapplications that have significant legal or policy implications or precedentialimpact. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Supplemental Information </ITAG>The Board wishes to note certain additional issues that have presentedquestions in connection with service corporations offering securities brokerageand investment advisory services: A. <T3>Compensation of Registered Representatives. </T3>The service corporationmay compensate its employees by salary, salary plus bonus, or commissions,or any other reasonable manner. B. <T3>Opinion of Counsel. </T3>Where the preapproval requires an opinionof counsel, any licensed, practicing attorney in good standing, includingcounsel to the association, the service corporation or the broker-dealer,may provide the opinion. C. <T3>Previous Delegations. </T3>This preapproval does not affect previousBoard approvals or delegations. An association that wants to invest ina service corporation that would contract with a broker-dealer that isthe subject of an existing delegation may apply to its Principal SupervisoryAgent for approval under that delegation. The Board recommends that theapplicant file with the necessary application materials a cover letteridentifying all differences between the current application and the contractsthat the Board has approved in the delegation. D. <T3>Corporate Separateness. </T3>The Board is not requiring the submissionof certifications that the service corporation and the association areseparate corporate entities and that both are in conformity with applicableregulations as a precondition of the preapproval, because the obligationof service corporations and associations to comply with 12 CFR 563.37 and570.10 is not altered by this preapproval. The Board continues to requirethat the service corporation be adequately capitalized as a separate corporationin the light of normal obligations reasonably foreseeable in a businessof its size and character, maintain separate accounts and records, andbe held out to the public as a separate enterprise. An institution wouldfail to meet the Board's separate corporate identities requirement if itdominates the service corporation to the extent that the latter is treatedas a mere department of the former. E. <T3>Customer Lists. </T3>Although these amendments do not address the association'sdistribution of information about its customers to the service corporationand to outside third parties, the Board does not permit the unrestricteddissemination of customer list information. The association and its servicecorporation must follow applicable Bank Board policy regarding the releaseof customer information. F. <T3>Pending Applications. </T3>These amendments will be effective 30 daysafter publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. As of the effective date, the Board will bein the process of reviewing pending applications. At effectiveness, however,the delegation of authority to the Office of District Banks to approvecertain brokerage and investment advisory service corporation applicationswill take effect. All pending applications will be subject to andSection;545.74(f). With respect to the applicable andSection; 571.12 timeclocks,all applications that have been deemed complete on or before the effectivenessdate of this regulation will be acted upon within 90 days from the datewhen the application was deemed complete. An applicant may choose to withdraw an application and submit a noticeunder the preapproval regulation. This notice must be filed no later thanthirty days prior to the commencement of operations. During this period,the Supervisory Agent will review the notice to determine whether it iscomplete, satisfies the preapproval criteria, and raises any supervisoryconcerns. Therefore, certain pending applications that have been deemedcomplete as of the effectiveness date will be approved pursuant to delegatedauthority at an earlier date than would applications deemed complete onthe same date that are withdrawn, with a preapproval notice filed, andthirty day review period observed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604,the Board is providing the following final regulatory flexibility analysis.1. <T3>Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the regulation. </T3>Theseelements have been discussed elsewhere in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION </T2>regarding the amendments.2. <T3>Small entities to which the regulation would apply. </T3>The regulationwould apply to all insured institutions.3. <T3>Impact of the regulation on small institutions. </T3>To the extentthat the regulation would affect small institutions, this has been discussedelsewhere.4. <T3>Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. </T3>There are no other federalregulations which duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the final regulation.5. <T3>Alternatives to the regulation. </T3>Other alternatives, such as presentregulations, may tend to prolong the waiting for permission to engage inbrokerage activities.
