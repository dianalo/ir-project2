Starting with engine electronics and continuingvia ABS and automatic gearboxes, there is hardly a unit or a system whichhas not been provided by electronic intelligence. To the extent thatthe number and the complexity of functions carried out increases, controlsbecome more difficult to perceive, more difficult to optimize and tocheck for faults. At the same time, the number of people apart from electronicengineers, who take part in the application and servicing of this equipmentis growing. This fact can become a problem as, compared with the controlsystems, work on aids to development and application has not been donewith the same intensity. The whole life cycle with the following phases,is concerned with this: Development and laboratory test, setting to workon test rig and in vehicle, optimisation and application and servicingon mass-produced vehicles. Due to the achievement of internal testingand diagnosis in future control generations, and the associated phasingout of the serial diagnosis interface ISO TC 221, new diagnostic equipmenthas to be developed. Together with an analysis of the techniques andequipment used up to now, this fact offers a possibility of developinga comprehensive futuristic diagnosis concept.</TEXT></DOC>
