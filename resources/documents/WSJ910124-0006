Wang, whose results contrast sharply with healthy resultsreported recently by competitors such as InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., posted aloss of $24.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the secondquarter ended Dec. 31.</LP><TEXT>   In the year-ago period, Wang, based in Lowell, Mass., hada loss of $10.5 million, or six cents a share, after a pretax$62.8 million restructuring charge and a pre-tax $116 milliongain from asset sales.   Citing the recession, weakening world markets, the PersianGulf crisis and sluggish sales of midrange computers, Wangsaid its revenue declined to $551.5 million, from $646.7million.   &quot;I was basically thinking that revenues would fall offaround 5% or so,&quot; said Shao Wang, an analyst with SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;Clearly, it was a continuation ofdecline in the service revenue bases, which is not a goodsign.&quot;   Nonetheless, Richard Miller, Wang's chairman and chiefexecutive, said he remains optimistic about Wang's newstrategy of emphasizing sales of new, industry-standard UNIXcomputers, instead of its proprietary VS computers.   &quot;Initially, these revenue declines (from older systems)will outpace revenue increases from the new products andservices,&quot; said Mr. Miller. &quot;Thus, we have expected andcontinue to expect an overall reduction in Wang's revenuebase.&quot;   For the six months, Wang had a loss of $22.1 million, or13 cents a share, on revenue of $1.12 billion. In theyear-ago period, Wang had losses of $72.6 million, or 44cents a share, on revenue of $1.25 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
