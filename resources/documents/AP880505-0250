Damage was estimated at $450 million, making the blaze the worsthigh-rise fire in Los Angeles history, fire officails said.   A sprinkler system was being installed in the 859-footskyscraper but was not quite complete.   ``It looked like Dante's Inferno,'' fire Capt. Steve Varneysaid. ``Everything that was burnable, burned down. It was justmetal and that was red hot.''   A small but undetermined number of people were working in theoffice tower when the blaze broke out about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday.During the workday the building is occupied by 3,500 people.   ``It could have been a `Towering Inferno.' It could have beenworse,'' said City Councilman John Ferraro. The 1974 movie ``TheTowering Inferno'' depicted a Los Angeles office building fire.   Some workers fled down stairs in thick smoke. Others fled to theroof as the fire roiled around the 12th through 15th floors andrained glass and flaming debris on downtown streets.   Four helicopters with searchlights swooped around the rooftop,and one helicopter lifted 10 people to safety, officers said.   ``We came out and we couldn't see anything but smoke,'' saidRadmila Radich, a cleaning woman who escaped.   Firefighters wearing air tanks had to lug hoses down stairs fromthe roof and up from the ground to attack the flames. Some airtanks ran out, and firefighters had to do without them, said FireChief Donald Manning.   ``They had 2,000-degree temperatures they were fighting,''Manning said of the 300 firefighters. ``The individuals in therewere committed so far in on the fire that they would run out ofair, they could not back out. They had to stay there and fight thatfire or they knew, as they told me, they were gonna die.''   ``This had a potential of killing a lot of my people,'' Manningsaid.   Damage was estimated at a preliminary $450 million, said FireDepartment spokesman Greg Acevedo.   The cause of the blaze was under investigation, said fire Cmdr.Donald Anthony.   If a sprinkler system had been operating, ``it would probablywould have contained the fire to a very small area,'' Anthony said.   A preliminary inspection indicated the structural frameworkremained sound, said Frank Kroker, an official of the Department ofBuilding and Safety.   A cleaning supervisor, Zora Imamovic, said that while she andfive others made their way from the 58th floor to the roof to beflown to safety, she heard a man calling for help over her two-wayradio.   ``One of the men was saying `Car 33' (a freight elevator) was inflames and he was screaming `Please help!,''' she said.   The badly burned body of janitor Alexander Handy, 22, ofPalmdale was found in an elevator stuck on the 12th floor, saidcounty coroner's spokesman Steve Stewart.   Thirty-seven maintenance workers and three firefighters weretreated for burns or smoke inhalation, but no one was hospitalized,officials said.   The fire was declared under control 3{ hours after it wasreported. Two survivors weren't brought down from the 37th flooruntil about dawn.   The skyscraper had no sprinkler system because it was built in1973, before fire codes required sprinklers, Manning said. Workerswere installing a $3.5 million system after the bank voluntarilydecided to do so.   William Siart, chairman and president of First Interstate Bank,said the system was 90 percent installed.   Art Devine, chief of management in the building department, saidhe will meet with the Fire Department to determine whether CityCouncil should be asked to revise the code.   Workers were told by radio stations to remain at home Thursday,but some were too curious to stay away.   ``When I got to the corner and I saw the firefighters, I said,`Oh my God,''' said Claudia Gonzalez, 26, a trust administrationspecialist. ``I'm still counting the floors. I could have beenthere,'' said the 11th-floor worker.   First Interstate has assets of $58.5 billion and is the nation'seighth largest banking company with 44 banks and offices in 19states. The fire is not expected to affect customers, saidspokesman John Popovich.   Operations on the gutted floors included foreign exchangetrading, corporate loan administration, personal trusts, economics,advertising and public affairs.   The bank keeps backup copies of customer records, butcorrespondence and some other files were lost, Popovich said. Mostof the computers that control checking and savings accounts andother business are in a building six blocks away, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
