(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The trustee for PTL says he will examinedeposed founder Jim Bakker's proposal to buy back the ministry, buthe doesn't think Bakker's plan is viable.   ``The real big problem for (Bakker) is that I think we're goingto have some better offers than his ... That's what we're waitingon, to see if they develop,'' said the court-appointed trustee,M.C. Benton.   Bakker's plan to buy back the Christian retreat and televisionministry calls for PTL's assets to be appraised at $130 million andall lawsuits against him to be dropped.   Bakker's conditions were listed in a three-page letter to Bentonreleased Friday by Ryan Hovis, Bakker's attorney.   Benton said he is uneasy about Bakker's plan to use the HeritageUSA theme park as collateral for the $100 million loan he will useto buy the ministry. Benton said Bakker's lawsuits against theministry were another hurdle.   In January, Bakker sued PTL to recover $1.3 million for a househis family had lived in. That house was sold for $685,000.   PTL countersued for more than $52 million, saying Bakker and hiswife, Tammy Faye, owed the ministry for excess salaries andmismanagement.   The letter released by Hovis did not shed any new light on whowould finance Bakker's $100 million loan. Bakker said the investoris foreign and is the head of a company worth $2.3 billion.   The ministry has been in financial straits since Bakker left inMarch 1987 after relevations that he had a sexual tryst with churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.   Benton said he continues to hold talks with businessmeninterested in buying the theme park, just south of Charlotte, N.C.He hopes to make a recommendation on a buyer to the bankruptcycourt by August.</TEXT></DOC>
