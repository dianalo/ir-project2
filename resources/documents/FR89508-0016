Specific fishery management measures vary by fishery and area. Togetherthey establish fishing areas, seasons, quotas, legal gear, recreationalfishing days and catch limits, possession and landing restrictions, andminimum lengths for salmon taken in the exclusive economic zone (3-200nautical miles) off Washington, Oregon, and California. Similar regulationsare being adopted for the State waters (0-3 nautical miles) by the Statesof Washington, Oregon, and California. The management measures and modifiedspawning escapement rate are intended to prevent overfishing and to apportionthe ocean harvest equitably among non-treaty commercial and recreationaland treaty Indian fisheries. The regulations also are calculated to allowa portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries to provide fortreaty and non-treaty Indian and non-Indian inside fisheries and spawning.These management measures and modified spawning escapement goal were establishedby the procedures instituted by the framework amendment to the FisheryManagement Plan for Ocean Salmon Fisheries off the Coasts of Washington,Oregon, and California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> This notice will be effective from 0001 hours Pacific DaylightTime (p.d.t.), May 1, 1989, until modified, superseded, or rescinded.

Theframework FMP was approved in 1984 and has been amended three times sincethen (52 FR 4146, February 10, 1987; 53 FR 30285, August 11, 1988). Implementingregulations for the latest amendment, Amendment 9, were filed with theOffice of the Federal Register and effective on May 1, 1989. Regulationsat 50 CFR Part 661 provide the mechanism for making preseason and inseasonadjustments to the management measures and for modifying spawning escapementgoals, within limits set by the FMP, by notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.This notice implements management measures for the 1989 and, as specified,the 1990 ocean salmon fisheries recommended by the Pacific Fishery ManagementCouncil (Council). <ITAG tagnum="84">Schedule Used To Establish 1989 Management Measures</ITAG>In accordance with the FMP, the Council's Salmon Technical Team (STT) andstaff economist prepared several reports for the Council, its advisors,and the public. The first report, ``Review of 1988 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,''summarizes the 1988 ocean salmon fisheries and assesses how well the Council'smanagement objectives were met in 1988. The second report, ``PreseasonReport I: Stock Abundance Analysis for 1989 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' providesthe 1989 salmon stock abundance projections and analyzes the impacts onthe stocks and Council management goals if 1988 regulations and regulatoryprocedures were applied to the 1989 stock abundance.The Council met on March 7-10, 1989, in Millbrae, California, to developproposed management options for 1989. Four commercial and three recreationalfishery management options were proposed for further analysis and publiccomment. These options presented various combinations of management measuresdesigned to protect weak stocks and provide for ocean harvests of moreabundant stocks of salmon. After the March Council meeting, the STT andstaff economist prepared a third report, ``Preseason Report II: Analysisof Proposed Regulatory Options for 1989 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' whichanalyzes the effects of the proposed 1989 management options. This reportalso was distributed to the Council, its advisors, and the public.Public hearings on the proposed options were held March 28-29, 1989, inSeattle, Washington; Astoria and Coos Bay, Oregon; and Eureka and Sacramento,California.The Council met on April 4-7, 1989, in Portland, Oregon, to adopt its final1989 recommendations to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary). Followingthe April Council meeting, the STT and staff economist prepared a fourthreport, ``Preseason Report III: 1989 Ocean Salmon Fisheries, Analysis ofImpacts of Council Adopted 1989 Regulations,'' which analyzes the environmentaland socio-economic effects of the Council's final recommendations. Thisreport also was distributed to the Council, its advisors, and the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">Resource Status</ITAG>Some salmon runs returning to Washington, Oregon, and California streamsin 1989 are expected to be larger than in 1988. These include a predictedabundance of Oregon Production Index (OPI) coho salmon stocks destinedfor Columbia River hatcheries and the California and Oregon coasts of 2,039,300fish compared to the 1988 post-season assessment of 2,008,100 fish, aswell as modest improvements in many Washington coastal and Puget Soundcoho salmon stocks.Primary resource concerns are for Klamath River fall chinook, ColumbiaRiver spring and summer chinook, and some Washington coastal and PugetSound natural coho salmon, particularly Skagit River and Queets River stocks.Management of these stocks is impacted by interjurisdictional agreementsamong tribal, state, Federal, and/or Canadian managers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chinook Salmon Stocks</ITAG>Abundance of California Central Valley chinook stocks is expected to belower than 1988 when record chinook landings were made in the commercialfishery south of Horse Mountain, California. Sacramento River fall-runchinook, which comprise the majority of Central Valley salmon, are healthy.Spawning escapement for Sacramento fall chinook is predicted to meet orexceed the 122,000-180,000 goal range in 1989.Escapements of upper Sacramento winter-run chinook have dwindled from over100,000 fish in the late 1960s to about 2,000 adult fish in recent years.This depressed run is only slightly impacted by ocean fisheries as theycurrently are configured, and that impact is primarily on two-year-oldfish in the recreational fishery. This run was considered by NOAA for listingas threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq</T3>., in 1987. At that time, NOAA determined that its propsedlisting as endangered or threatened was not warranted because State andFederal resource management agencies had agreed to address the habitatproblems that contributed to its decline (52 FR 6041, February 27, 1987).This determination was reaffirmed in 1988 (53 FR 49722, December 9, 1988).Klamath River fall-run chinook are the primary management concern in thearea from the Orford Reef Red Buoy off southern Oregon to Horse Mountainoff northern California, the so-called ``Klamath River Management Zone.''The estimated total ocean population of age-3 and age-4 Klamath River fallchinook in 1989 is 397,700, above the 334,500 predicted abundance in 1988but below the actual 1988 abundance of 530,200. Ocean escapement to theKlamath River in 1988 totaled 181,200 adult fish, well above the projected1988 escapement of 132,000 fish. Amendment 9 to the framework FMP replaced the long-term spawning escapementgoal and interim rebuilding schedule for Klamath River fall chinook withfixed annual spawning escapement and harvest rates will allow a fixed percentageof the potential adults from each brood of natural spawners to escape thefisheries and spawn. Under this approach, the actual number of adult naturalspawners will vary each year in proportion to the total abundance of adults.Spawning escapements will be higher in years of higher abundance and lowerin years of lower abundance, subject to a minimum spawning escapement floorof 35,000 naturally spawning adults. Amendment 9 and its implementing regulationsinitially established a spawning escapement rate of 35 percent. Based onthe Council's recommendation, the Secretary has modified the 35 percentspawning escapement rate to a 33-34 percent spawning escapement rate inaccordance with the procedures in the framework FMP and its implementingregulations (see following section ``Modification of Klamath River FallChinook Spawning Escapement Goal''). Based on a 33-34 percent spawningescapement rate, the 1989 projected ocean escapement to the Klamath Riveris 165,900 fish. Oregon coastal chinook stocks include south-migrating and localized stocksprimarily from southern Oregon streams, and north-migrating chinook stockswhich generally originate in central and northern Oregon streams. Abundanceof south-migrating and localized stocks is expected to be somewhat lowerthan 1988 levels. These stocks are important contributors to ocean fisheriesoff Oregon and northern California. The generalized expectation for north-migratingstocks is for a continuation of above average abundance as observed inrecent years. These stocks primarily contribute to ocean fisheries offBritish Columbia and Alaska. It is expected that the aggregate Oregon coastalchinook spawning escapement goal of 150,000 to 200,000 naturally spawningadults will continue to be met. Estimates of Columbia River chinook abundance vary by stock as follows.(1) Columbia River spring and summer chinook. Numbers of upriver springchinook predicted to return to the river are 4 percent below the 1988 runsize, but 64 percent greater than the 1979-1984 average. The 1989 stockstatus continues to be depressed, and expected ocean escapement is substantiallybelow the goal of 115,000 adults counted at Bonneville Dam. Upriver springchinook escapement is affected only slightly by fisheries off the coastsof Washington and Oregon. Lower river spring (Willamette) chinook returnsare projected to be 14 percent below the 1988 run, but 57 percent greaterthan the 1980-1984 average. Expected abundance of upriver summer chinookis the same as in 1988. The stock's status remains extremely depressed,with ocean escapement being about 63 percent below the midpoint of thegoal range of 80,000 to 90,000 adults counted at Bonneville Dam. Upriversummer chinook migrate to the far north and are not a major contributingstock to Council fishery catches. Concern for increasing harvest rateson upriver spring and summer chinook stocks in Council and Washington Straitof Juan de Fuca area fisheries was a major factor in the determinationof total allowable fishery impacts in Council fisheries for 1989. (2) Columbia River fall chinook. Upriver bright fall chinook ocean escapementis expected to be about 231,800 adults, 31 percent below the 1988 return,but about 2.1 times the 1981-1985 level. Lower river natural fall chinookocean escapement is forecast at about 30,000 adults, 24 percent below the1988 run. Columbia River fall hatchery tules normally account for morethan half the total catch north of Cape Falcon, Oregon. Ocean escapementof lower river hatchery fall chinook, the single largest stock group contributingto harvests north of Cape Falcon, Oregon, is forecast at about 97,500 adults,68 percent less than the 1988 run size and 9 percent less than the 1981-1985average. Spring Creek hatchery fall chinook ocean escapement is projectedto be about 23,000 fish, 72 percent greater than the 1988 return; the 1981-1985average ocean escapement was 63,300 adults. Washington coastal and Puget Sound chinook generally migrate to the farnorth and are affected insignificantly by ocean harvests from Cape Falconto the U.S.-Canada border. <ITAG tagnum="84">Coho Salmon Stocks</ITAG>The Oregon Production Index (OPI) is an annual index of coho abundancefrom Leadbetter Point, Washington, south through California. Oregon coastaland Columbia River coho stocks are the primary components of the OPI. The1989 OPI is 2,039,300 coho, 14 percent below the 1988 preseason forecastand 2 percent above 1988 observed levels. The 1989 estimate includes 446,200Oregon coastal natural (OCN) coho salmon, a decrease from the 1988 predictedabundance level of 480,300. The methodology for calculating the privateand public hatchery components and the OCN components of the OPI is describedin the Council's ``Preseason Report I: Stock Abundance Analysis for 1989Ocean Salmon Fisheries.'' The 1988 spawning escapement of the OCN stockswas 158,900, some 41,100 fish or 21 percent below the spawning escapementgoal of 200,000.In general, 1989 stock abundance for Washington coastal and Puget Soundcoho salmon stocks is slightly improved over 1988. Ocean escapements expectedfrom Council management measures in 1989 are sufficient to provide forsome inside area fishery harvest while achieving spawning escapement goalsor minimum acceptable levels for most Puget Sound and Washington coastalnatural coho stocks. Skagit River and Queets River natural coho continueto be primary resource conservation constraints in both ocean and insidefisheries. The Skagit River natural coho stock spawning escapement expectationis 10,000 fish below the goal of 30,000 adults. Queets River natural cohospawning escapement is expected to be below the floor level of 5,800 adults.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pink Salmon Stocks</ITAG>Two major stocks comprise the pink salmon population available to the oceanfisheries during odd-numbered years. The Fraser River pink run is forecastat 17 million compared with the 1977-1987 (odd years only) average runsize of 14 million. The preliminary preseason forecast for Puget Soundorigin pink salmon is for above average abundance; the 1977-1987 averageis less than 2 million.The Fraser River Panel of the Pacific Salmon Commission has jurisdictionover all U.S. Pink and sockeye salmon fisheries in the ocean waters northof approximately Carroll Island, Washington, and the inside waters of theStrait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound. The Fraser River Panel has notifiedthe Council that it intends to maintain jursidiction over the ocean commercialtroll harvest of pink salmon during the 1989 fishing season. In recentyears, the Fraser River Panel has deferred to the Council's recommendationsfor ocean regulations governing pink salmon harvest. Thus, regulationspromulgated by the Fraser River Panel may supersede the Secretary's regulationsfor the ocean hearvest of pink salmon in 1989 between 48 N. lat. and theU.S.-Canada border between 3 and 200 nautical miles of shore.<ITAG tagnum="85">Modification of Klamath River Fall Chinook Spawning Escapement Goal</ITAG>Amendment 9 to the framework FMP, which was approved by the Secretary onMarch 14, 1989 and implemented on May 1, 1989, replaced the long-term spawningescapement goal and interim rebuilding schedule for Klamath River fallchinook contained in the framework FMP with fixed annual spawning escapementand harvest rates. Under this approach, the spawning escapement rate wouldbe held constant over a long period of time to allow the magnitude of landingsand escapement to vary in proportion to the stock abundance, subject toa minimum spawning escapement floor of 35,000 naturally spawning adults.The purpose of shifting to a spawning escapement rate approach was to allowfor natural variation in the spawning escapement and to obtain informationon the productivity of the Klamath River Basin to ultimately determinethe optimum escapement. Analysis of this approach indicated it would resultin the achievement of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) over the long term.The initial spawning escapement rate set by Amendment 9 is 35 percent,and is based on the recommendation of the Klamath River Technical Team,an advisory body to the Klamath Fishery Management Council (KFMC). TheKFMC was established under the Klamath and Trinity River Basins RestorationAct (Pub.L. 99-552) to establish, among other things, a long-term policyfor managing the ocean and in-river harvest of Klamath River salmon, andto recommend ocean harvesting regulations to the Council.The Council recognized that the fixed spawning escapement rate would requireannual technical review by the Council and the STT and occasionally wouldneed to be revised to remain current with the best scientific informationavailable. Consequently, the Council recommended that specific proceduresfor STT review and subsequent modification of spawning escapement goalscontained in the framework FMP would also apply to the Klamath River fallchinook spawning escapement rate. Under the procedures contained in 50CFR 661.22 (50 FR 813, January 7, 1985), the Secretary is authorized tomodify an escapement goal by publishing a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> under andSection; 661.23 if: ``A comprehensivetechnical review of the best scientific information available providesconclusive evidence which, in the view of the Salmon Technical Team andthe Council, justifies modification of an escapement goal.''At the March 7-10, 1989, Council meeting, the STT reviewed the basic parametersof the model used to develop the 35 percent spawning escapement rate andrecommended to the Council that, based on specific changes to some of theparameters, a spawning escapement rate of between 33 and 34 percent wasmore appropriate. The STT's recommendation was included in ``PreseasonReport II: Analysis of Proposed Regulatory Options for 1989 Ocean SalmonFisheries'' which was distributed to the Council, its advisors, and thepublic. The Council recommended to the Secretary that the spawning escapementrate be revised accordingly. The Secretary has determined that such a changeis justified and herein modifies the Klamath River fall chinook spawningescapement rate from 35 percent to between 33 and 34 percent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Management Measures for 1989</ITAG>The Council adopted allowable ocean harvest levels and management measuresfor 1989 which are designated to apportion the burden of protecting theweak stocks discussed above equitably among ocean fisheries and to allowmaximum harvest of natural and hatchery runs surplus to inside fisheryand spawning needs.North of Cape FalconFor the area north of Cape Falcon, Oregon, all non-treaty commercial trolland recreational ocean fisheries will be limited by either (a) an overall95,000 chinook quota, or (b) impacts on critical Washington coastal andPuget Sound natural stocks equivalent to the preseason coho quota of 300,000.The recreational fishery will be limited by overall quotas of 47,500 chinookand 225,000 coho salmon. The commercial troll salmon fishery will be limitedby overall quotas of 47,500 chinook and 75,000 coho salmon. Treaty Indiantroll fisheries will be limited by overall quotas of 32,000 chinook and77,000 coho salmon. Chinook quotas for non-treaty (95,000) and treaty (32,000)ocean fisheries in the area north of Cape Falcon are based on upper ColumbiaRiver spring chinook harvest rates in Washington's Strait of Juan de Fucaarea and ocean troll and recreational fisheries. The 1989 quota levels,including restrictions to the non-treaty troll fishery in the area northof the Queets River, are expected to result in a rate of fishery impacton upriver spring chinook that is equivalent to the rate observed for eachof the fisheries in the 1988 seasons. The harvest rate estimates in thenon-treaty and treaty ocean fisheries assume chinook harvest levels forStrait of Juan de Fuca fisheries in 1989 will be equivalent to 32,000 (treatytroll) and 48,200 (recreational) fish.The recreational fishery between the U.S.-Canada border and Cape Falconwill open for all species except coho salmon on May 28 and continue throughJune 12 or the overall recreational chinook quota of 47,500. Fishing willbe allowed Sunday and Monday only, 0 to 6 nautical miles of shore, witha 2 fish daily bag limit. A harvest guideline of 5,000 chinook will apply.Harvest guidelines do not serve as quotas requiring mandatory closure ofa fishery when reached, but are harvest goals which may serve as the basisfor inseason management adjustments to ensure that harvest guidelines arenot greatly exceeded. The all-species recreational fishery between theU.S.-Canada border and the Queets River will open July 2 through the earliestof September 28 or the overall recreational chinook quota of 47,500 orthe subarea coho quota of 22,500. Fishing will be allowed Sunday throughThursday with a 2 fish daily bag limit and a harvest guideline of 3,900chinook. In the two subareas between the Queets River and Cape Falcon,the all-species recreational fishery will open June 26 through the earliestof September 28 or the overall recreational chinook quota or the subareacoho quotas of 91,100 for the Queets River to Leadbetter Point and 111,400for Leadbetter Point to Cape Falcon. Fishing will be allowed Sunday throughThursday with a 2 fish daily bag limit and chinook harvest guidelines of24,300 for Queets River to Leadbetter Point and 14,300 for Leadbetter Pointto Cape Falcon.The commercial troll salmon fishery for all species except coho salmonwill open in the area between the Queets River and Cape Falcon May 1 throughJune 15 or a chinook quota of 39,500. An all-species troll season, designedprimarily to take pink salmon, will open August 7 through the earlier ofAugust 31 or a coho quota of 40,000. Fishing will be limited to an areawhich is generally beyond the 100 fathom line with gear limited to flasherswith barbless, bare, blued hooks. A 4,000 chinook salmon harvest guidelinewill apply. A second all-species troll season between the Red Buoy Lineand Cape Falcon will open for 1 day, August 21, close for 2 days, thenreopen August 24 through the earliest of October 31 or a coho quota of35,000 or the overall chinook quota. This season is confined to the southernportion of the area north of Cape Falcon in order to protect northern Washingtoncoastal coho salmon stocks.South of Cape FalconThe predominant chinook salmon management concern in the area south ofCape Falcon is to provide for the harvest of healthy chinook and coho salmonstocks from many California and Oregon coastal streams and the ColumbiaRiver while, at the same time, protecting adequate numbers of Klamath Riverfall chinook salmon in the ocean areas to meet the modified Klamath Riverspawning escapement rate of 33-34 percent of the total adult ocean abundanceand provide for inriver fisheries at generally the 1988 level. These managementconstraints resulted in the Council recommending very restrictive fishingseasons in the area between Orford Reef Red Buoy in southern Oregon andHorse Mountain in northern California (the so-called ``Klamath FisheryManagement Zone'' or KMZ). Because the Council wanted to allow some fishingwithin the KMZ to offset potential socio-economic hardships that wouldresult from total closure of the KMZ, additional dampening of the fisheries,especially the troll fishery, was required in the areas both north andsouth of the KMZ. The management measures recommended by the Council areprojected to achieve an ocean escapement of 165,900 adult Klamath Riverfall chinook and an escapement of 98,300 natural adult spawners, assuminginriver fisheries harvest 67,600 adult fish.Total fishery impacts on coho salmon in the area south of Cape Falcon arelimited to levels which provide for the achievement of the OCN stock spawningescapement goal of 200,000 adults. Additionally, the level of fishery impacton Washington coastal coho stocks was constrained to the average rate ofimpact measured for the period from 1979 to 1981.The overall coho salmon recreational impact (catch plus hooking mortalityin all-species-except-coho fisheries) is limited to 285,000 coho salmonfrom Cape Falcon to the U.S.-Mexico border. Any of the coho salmon recreationalimpact quota not needed to complete the scheduled recreational seasonswill be rolled over to the commercial troll fishery about August 1. Thecommercial troll salmon fishery from Cape Falcon to the U.S.-Mexico borderis limited to an overall combined catch (474,000) and hooking mortalityimpact quota of 561,000 coho salmon. The catch quota is 474,000 coho salmon.An impact ceiling of no more than 100,000 (89,000 catch) coho salmon impactquota may be taken south of Orford Reef Red Buoy and no more than 430,000(349,000 catch) south of Cascade Head. There is a separate 5,000 coho salmonquota for the area south of Horse Mountain that is deducted preseason fromthe overall quotas and ceilings and is to begin on attainment of the overallcoho quota south of Cape Falcon or either coho ceiling minus the deduction.The recreational fishery for all species from Cape Falcon to the OrfordReef Red Buoy will open May 1 through May 26 shoreward of a line generallyrepresenting the 27 fathom curve. Between May 27 and the earliest of September15 or the coho quota the fishery is open for all species with no area restrictions.The bag limit is 2 fish per day, and not more than 6 fish in 7 consecutivedays, for both seasons.The commercial troll fishery from Cape Falcon to Cascade Head will openMay 1 through July 11 for all species except coho. The all-species seasonwill open July 12 through earliest of August 31 or the coho quota at whichtime the fishery will continue for all species except coho. A 3-day closurewill occur when the catch has reached 75 percent of the coho ceiling forthe area south of Cascade Head. Between Cape Falcon and Orford Reef RedBuoy, an all species except coho season will open from September 1 throughOctober 31.Between Cascade Head and Orford Reef Red Buoy, the area adjacent to andnorth of the KMZ, the commercial troll seasons reflect dampening measuresto control the harvest of Klamath River fall chinook to the level of oceanescapement required by the FMP. The commercial troll season will open May1 through June 23 for all species except coho. The season will be closedfor 7 days during June 24-30 then reopen for all species July 1 throughthe earliest of August 31 or the coho quota or ceiling. At such time thatthe coho catch reaches 75 percent of the south of Cascade Head coho ceiling,the fishery will be closed for 3 days to assess whether inseason managementmeasures are necessary to dampen the catch rate. If the season is closedprior to August 31 because of achievement of the coho quota or ceiling,it will reopen immediately for all species except coho. During the all-speciesseason a daily landing limit of 50 coho plus at least 1 chinook for each3 coho over 50 is applied. Two small subarea closures between Cape Aragoand Orford Reef Red Buoy will occur during July 14-31 and August 18-31to further reduce impacts on Klamath River fall chinook.Between Orford Reef Red Buoy and Horse Mountain (the KMZ), the recreationalfishery will open May 1 through September 30 for all species with a harvestguideline of 80,000 chinook salmon and a daily bag limit of 2 fish. Ifnecessary to more closely meet the chinook harvest guideline, the dailybag limit will be adjusted on about August 1 to 2 fish, only 1 of whichmay be a chinook, if 40,000 chinook have been landed by July 15. A smallarea off the Klamath River mouth will be closed during August 1-31 (ConservationZone 2).The commercial troll fisheries in the KMZ have been severely restrictedto achieve the FMP's spawning escapement rate for Klamath River fall chinookstocks and to provide for in-river harvest at the 1988 level. Two smallareas between Orford Reef Red Buoy and Humbug Mountain, Oregon, and betweenPunta Gorda and Horse Mountain, California are all closed all year to thecommercial troll fishery in order to separate the KMZ from fisheries inareas to the north and south. The area within the KMZ between Humbug Mountainand Punta Gorda will open for all species June 5 through earliest of June16 or a chinook quota of 15,000 or the south of Cape Falcon coho quotaor ceiling with a single daily landing limit of 20 chinook. The seasonwill be closed between June 17 and August 17 then reopen for all speciesAugust 18 through earliest of August 31 or a chinook quota of 7,500 orthe coho quota or ceiling with a single daily landing limit of 20 chinook.If the coho quota or ceiling is reached before the chinook quotas in theseareas, the season would remain open for all species except coho until thechinook quotas are reached. Conservation Zone 2 around the Klamath Rivermouth is closed all year.Three small chinook fisheries are authorized within portions of the KMZto allow the harvest of Rogue River and Eel River chinook salmon. BetweenSisters Rocks and House Rock, Oregon, the season will open for all speciesexcept coho May 1 through earliest of May 14 or a chinook quota of 7,500only within 0 to 6 nautical miles of shore. Between Sisters Rocks and MackArch a fall season will open for all species except coho September 1 throughearliest of September 15 or a chinook quota of 7,500 within 0 to 6 nauticalmiles of shore. Finally, between Trinidad Head and Punta Gorda an all-speciesseason will open September 15 through earliest of October 31 or a chinookquota of 15,000 within 0 to 6 nautical miles of shore.Between Horse Mountain and the U.S.-Mexico border the recreational seasonis the same as during 1988. It opens the nearest Saturday to February 15through the nearest Sunday to November 15 with a 2 fish daily bag limit.The commercial troll fishery between Horse Mountain and Point Arena, adjacentto and just south of the KMZ, contains three block closures designed todampen the catch of Klamath River fall chinook. The commercial troll seasonwill open for all species except coho May 1 through May 17, close betweenMay 18 and June 4, reopen for all species June 5 through earliest of June17 or coho quota, close between June 18 and July 1, reopen for all speciesJuly 2 through earliest of July 14 or coho quota, close between July 15and July 28, then reopen for all species July 29 through the earliest ofthe south of Cape Falcon overall coho quota or subarea ceilings plus thespecial subarea coho quota of 5,000 fish for the entire area south of HorseMountain. At such time as the subarea coho quota of 5,000 fish is reached,the season will remain open only to all species except coho.California commercial troll representatives have requested a redistributionof salmon fishing opportunity among the California ports in order to achievea more favorable distribution of economic benefits. Public comments areinvited on this issue.The commercial troll fishery between Point Arena and the U.S.-Mexico borderwill open for all species except coho May 1 through May 31, then changeto an all-species season June 1 through the earliest of September 30 oroverall coho quota. If the overall coho quota is reached before September30, the all-species season will continue under a special subarea quotaof 5,000 coho for the area south of Horse Mountain. After the subarea quotais reached, the season reverts to all species except coho through September30.The timing of the March and April Council meetings makes it impracticablefor the Council to recommend fishing seasons to the Secretary that beginbefore May 1 of the same year. Thus, any opening earlier than May 1 for1990 fishing seasons must be provided for at this time because the regulationsstemming from the Council's April 1990 meeting cannot be implemented beforeMay 1, 1990. The Council has recommended that the commercial troll fisheryoff California open April 15, 1990. However, scientific information onstock abundance of critical stocks will not be available to the Counciluntil February and March of 1990 which may make it necessary to adjustthe opening date for some areas or subareas off California prior to April15, 1990. Therefore, the Council has recommended, and the Secretary concurs,that the Council may recommend to the Secretary prior to April 15, 1990,modifications to the April 15 opening date and areas in order to avoidadverse impacts on critical stocks. The Secretary will publish a noticeof any such modifications in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in accordance with the procedures authorizedin andSection; 661.23.The following tables and text are the management measures recommended bythe Council for 1989 and, as specified, for 1990. Specific measures varyby fishery and area. Together they establish fishing areas, seasons, quotas,legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, possession andlanding restrictions, and minimum lengths for salmon taken in the exclusiveeconomic zone (EEZ) off Washington, Oregon, and California. The Secretaryconcurs with these recommendations and finds them responsive to the goalsof the FMP, the requirements of the resource, and the socio-economic conditionsaffected by ocean fisheries. The recommendations are consistent with therequirements of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act andother applicable law including United States obligations to Indian tribeswith treaty-secured fishing rights.The following management measures are adopted for 1989 and, as specified,for 1990 under 50 CFR Part 661.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 1._<T4>Commercial Management Measures for </T4>1989<T4> Ocean Salmon Fisheries</T4><ITAG tagnum="96"/><T4>[Note:</T4> This table contains important restrictions in Parts A,B, C, and D which must be followed for lawful participation in the fishery]<H1>Area and season</H1><H1>Salmon species</H1><H1>Quota or guideline(*)</H1><H2>Chinook</H2><H2>Coho</H2><H1>Restrictions and exceptions</H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>A.

The troll fishery will be limited by overall quotas of 47,500chinook and 75,000 coho. The overall troll chinook quota is partitionedinto one subarea quota of 39,500 and two subarea guidelines of 4,000 each.The overall troll coho quota is partitioned into two subarea quotas of40,000 and 35,000. Impacts from quota overages or underages from one fishingperiod or subarea will be subtracted from or added to later fishing periodsof the same user group or transferred between the recreational and commercialfisheries in accordance with framework allocation transfer criteria.D-2. <T3>Coho quotas south of Cape Falcon. </T3>The troll fishery from CapeFalcon to the U.S.-Mexico border will be limited to an overall combinedcatch and hooking mortality of 561,000 coho. The overall preseason catchquota for this impact is 474,000 coho. Subarea catch ceilings within theoverall catch quota allow impacts of no more than 430,000 coho and a catchof no more than 349,000 coho south of Cascade Head, of which impacts maybe no more than 100,000 coho and the catch may be no more than 89,000 cohosouth of Orford Reef Red Buoy. A separate subarea catch quota of 5,000coho will be reserved preseason for the troll fishery south of Horse Mountainby deducting it from the overall catch quota and subarea ceilings. Thesubarea catch quota will begin upon the attainment of the overall catchquota or subarea ceilings minus the deduction. If the overall coho quotaor any subarea ceiling is exceeded before the fisheries are closed, theoverage will not be subtracted from the 5,000 coho reserve. An inseasonrollover to the troll fishery of any portion of the south of Cape Falconrecreational quota projected to be in excess of sport fishery needs willbe made about August 1.D-3. <T3>Chinook quotas between Humbug Mountain and Punta Gorda. </T3>The trollfishery in this area will be limited by an overall quota of 30,000 chinookthrough August 31. This quota is divided into three subquotas as follows:(1) 7,500 chinook for the May 1-14 fishery between Sisters Rocks and HouseRock, (2) 15,000 chinook for the entire area in the June fishery, and (3)7,500 chinook for the entire area in the August fishery. Any overages orunderages in meeting a subquota for one time period will be subtractedfrom or added to the next troll fishery prior to August 31. There are twochinook quotas governing September troll fisheries of (1) 7,500 chinookbetween Sisters Rocks and Mack Arch, and (2) 15,000 chinook between TrinidadHead and Punta Gorda.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 2._<T4>Recreational Management Measures for </T4>1989 <T4>Ocean Salmon Fisheries</T4><ITAG tagnum="96"/><T4>[Note: </T4>This table contains important restrictions in Parts A,B, C, and D which must be followed for lawful participation in the fishery]<H1>Area and season</H1><H1>Salmon species</H1><H1>Quota or guideline(*)</H1><H2>Chinook</H2><H2>Coho</H2><H1>Restrictions and exceptions</H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>A.

Federal and State inseason management actions may be taken north ofCape Falcon to extend the fishery to the end of its scheduled season orto keep within chinook harvest guidelines for each of the subareas. Suchactions might include: closure for 0 to 3, or 0 to 6, or 3 to 200, or 5to 200 nautical miles of shore; close from a point extending due west fromTatoosh Island for 5 miles, then south to a point due west of UmatillaReef Buoy, then due east to shore; close from North Head at the ColumbiaRiver mouth north to Leadbetter Point; and change species which may belanded.C-6. Impacts north of Cape Falcon are based on a Buoy 10 fishery (ColumbiaRiver mouth to Astoria-Megler Bridge) with a harvest guideline of 200,000coho and 30,000 chinook. For impact analysis, a catch of 130,000 coho isassumed for the period August 16-27 and 70,000 coho after August 27.C-7. Consistent with Council management objectives, the State of Oregonmay establish some additional late season, all-except-coho fisheries instate waters.<R/><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>D.

No person may usemore than one rod and line while fishing off Oregon or Washington.In that portion of the FMA off California, the line must be attached toa rod and reel held by hand or closely attended. Weights directly attachedto a line may not exceed four (4) pounds. There is no limit to the numberof lines that a person may use while recreationally fishing off California.Geographical LandmarksWherever the words ``nautical miles of shore'' are used in this rule, thedistance is measured from the baseline from which the territorial sea ismeasured.Geographical landmarks referenced in this notice are at the following locations:<ITAG tagnum="15">Umatilla-Tatoosh Line_A straight line drawn southerly from the CapeFlattery light (48anddegrees;23andmin16;50andmin16;andmin16; N. latitude) to UmatillaBuoy (48anddegrees;11andmin16;20andmin16;andmin16; N. latitude). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Carroll Island_48anddegrees;00andmin16;18andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Queets River_47anddegrees;31andmin16;42andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Leadbaetter Point_46anddegrees;18andmin16;10andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">North Head_46anddegrees;18andmin16;00andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Red Buoy Line_Seaward along the south jetty of the Columbia Riverto the visible tip of the jetty and then to Buoy andplusmin;2SJ, then southwesterlyto Buoy andplusmin;4, continuing southwesterly to Buoy andplusmin;2, and thento the Columbia River Buoy, then due west along 46anddegrees;11andmin16;06andmin16;andmin16;N. latitude.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Cape Falcon_45anddegrees;46andmin16;00andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Cascade Head_45anddegrees;03andmin16;50andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Cape Arago_43anddegrees;18andmin16;20andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Orford Reef Red Buoy_42anddegrees;45andmin16;11andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Humbug Mountain_42anddegrees;40andmin16;30andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Sister Rocks_42anddegrees;35andmin16;45andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mack Arch_42anddegrees;13andmin16;40andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">House Rock_42anddegrees;06andmin16;32andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Trinidad Head_41anddegrees;03andmin16;30andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Punta Gorda_40anddegrees;15andmin16;30andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Horse Mountain_40anddegrees;05andmin16;00andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Point Arena_38anddegrees;57andmin16;30andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Point Conception_34anddegrees;27andmin16;00andmin16;andmin16; N. lat.</ITAG>InseasonNotice ProceduresActual notice of inseason management actions will be provided by a telephonehotline administered by the Northwest Region, NMFS, 206-526-6667, and byU.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariner broadcasts. These broadcasts are announcedon Channel 16 VHF-FM and 2182 KHZ at frequent intervals. The announcementsdesignate the channel or frequency over which the Notice to Mariners willbe immediately broadcast. Inseason actions will also be filed with the<T4>Federal Register</T4> as soon as practicable. Since provisions of thesemanagement measures may be altered by inseason actions, fishermen shouldmonitor either the telephone hotline or Coast Guard broadcasts for currentinformation for the area in which they are fishing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The 1989 and specified 1990 management measures described above are basedon the most recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the measuresare based are available for public inspection at the offices of the RegionalDirectors (see <T2>``ADDRESSES''</T2>) during business hours until the end of the commentperiod.These actions are taken under 50 CFR Part 661, are in compliance with ExecutiveOrder 12291, and are covered by the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA)and Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) prepared forthe framework amendment to the FMP. These actions impose no informationcollection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act.Section 661.23 of the ocean salmon regulations states that the Secretarywill publish a notice establishing management measures each year and willinvite public comments prior to its effective date. If the Secretary determines,for good cause, that a notice must be issued without affording a prioropportunity for public comment, comments on the notice will be receivedby the Secretary for a period of 15 days after the filing of the noticewith the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Because of the depressed status of some salmon stocks, and the need toreduce harvest in some areas to prevent overfishing and achieve the FMP'sspawning escapement goals, the Secretary has determined that time doesnot permit a comment period prior to the date the management measures mustbe in effect. Comments will be accepted for 15 days after the effectivedate of this notice.The public has had opportunity to comment on these management measuresduring the process of their development. The public participated in theMarch and April Council, STT, and Salmon Advisory Subpanel meetings, andin public hearings held in Washington, Oregon, and California in late March,which generated the management actions recommended by the Council and approvedby the Secretary. Written public comments were invited by the Council betweenthe March and April Council meetings.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801<T3> et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Andrew J.
