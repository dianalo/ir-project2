The use of rockanchors was adopted in the construction of backfill concrete structuresaround the nuclear reactor building in the Tomari Nuclear Power Plant.To improve the durability of the permanent rock anchors and to facilitatethe maintenance of their tension, both the fixed and free portions ofthe anchors were covered with polyethylene sheaths for corrositon prevention.Evaluation of their performance was made. Special small jacks were developedwhich were able to measure and adjust the tension. The jacks were combinedwith digital measuring apparatus and a personal computer to constructa system for easy tension measurement. Tension measurement was carriedout about one year after the fixation of the anchors and readjustmentof tension was performed. In addition, longterm changes in tension afterthe fixation of the anchors were observed (creep test) to provide datarequired for future tension maintenance. Results of the creep test showedthat there were no anchors that required a larger jack to carry out thereadjustment of their tension. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
