Tobacco industry lobbyists ended up pushing for the permanentban Friday after a 25-25 vote on a ban that would have covered alldomestic flights indicated growing congressional support forproposals to broaden the airline smoking ban.   The tie vote defeated the wider ban, but it was the closest acongressional vote has come to outlawing all smoking on airliners.   The bill, passed on a voice vote by the House Public Works andTransportation Committee, is one of several proposals to extend orexpand the 1987 temporary smoking ban on flights of two hours orless. That ban expires in April.   Opponents made tongue-in-cheek suggestions that liquor, cheapcologne and crying babies could also be banned because they offendsome people.   Rep. William Clinger, R-Pa., who supported the permanent ban butopposed all proposals that would affect flights over two hours,joked that the committee might vote to ``install cheap colognedetectors and put crying babies in the hold.''   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who pushed for a total smokingban, said the committee's defeat of attempts to apply the ban tolonger flights reflects strong lobbying by the tobacco industry.   Oberstar said a more far-reaching ban would likely pass theHouse but he declined to predict what the Senate might do.   One of the measures to extend the smoking ban is in the form ofan amendment to an appropriations bill. The House is expected totake that up next week.   Oberstar described Friday's vote as a ``short-term gain'' forthe tobacco industry, which at first opposed making the two-hourban permanent. However, several tobacco lobbyists switchedstrategies as the committee was voting.   In the end, pro-smoking forces supported a permanent ban whileanti-smoking committee members voted for a four-year extension ofthe temporary ban in the hope of ensuring that Congress again wouldhave to consider a total ban.   Anti-smoking groups have said they will continue to fightagainst smoking on any airliner.   ``The two-hour ban is far from a perfect piece of legislationand very far from the solution needed to protect all airlinepassengers and all flight crews from the serious hazards created bytobacco smoke in the airline cabin,'' said Ahron Leichtman,president of Citizens Against Tobacco Smoke.   Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., who said his wife of 34 years died fromcancer, called in-flight smoking a life-and-death issue.   ``On an airplane, you can't open the window when someone elsesmokes. In midair, you can't transfer planes,'' Savage said.``Rights are for now, but death is forever.''</TEXT></DOC>
