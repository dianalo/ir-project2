The weighted-average margins are shown in the``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since the last <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication pertaining to this investigation(the Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value(53 FR 6021, February 29, 1988)), the following events have occurred. On March 2, 1988, respondents requested that we postpone the final determinationuntil June 20, 1988. On March 10, 1988, in accordance with section 735(a)(2)(A)of the Act, we postponed the final determination until June 20, 1988 (53FR 8479, March 15, 1988). Verification of the responses was conducted from March 14 through April1, 1988. A public hearing was requested. This request was subsequentlywithdrawn. Final comments were received from petitioner and respondents.On June 2, 1988, respondents requested that we postpone the final determinationuntil not later than 135 days after the date of publication of our preliminarydetermination. On June 9, 1988, in accordance with section 735(a)(2)(A)of the Act, we postponed the final determination until July 13, 1988 (53FR 22369, June 15, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The products covered by this investigation are certain granite products.Certain granite products are \3/8\ inch (1 cm) to 2\1/2\ inches (6.34cm)in thickness and include the following: Rough-sawed granite slabs; face-finishedgranite slabs; and finished dimensional granite including, but not limitedto, building facing, flooring, wall and floor tiles, paving, and cryptfronts. Certain granite products do not include monumental stones, crushedgranite, or curbing. Certain granite products are provided for under <T3>TSUSA</T3> item number 513.7400 and under <T3>HS</T3> item numbers 2516.12.00, 6802.23.00 and 6802.93.00. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>For rough slabs, slabs not cut-to-size, and tiles, the period of investigation(POI) is March 1, 1987 through August 31, 1987. For cut-to-size slabs orprojects, the POI is January 1, 1987 through August 31, 1987, for projectscompleted by November 30, 1987. In order to include additional sales ofsome larger projects, we requested data on projects sold as early as July1986. (See Comment 9.) <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales in the United States of the subject  merchandisewere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States pricewith the foreign market value as specified below. For the reasons cited below, we have determined, in accordance with section776(b) of the Act, that use of best information otherwise available (BIA)is appropriate for all sales by F.lli Guarda S.p.A. (Guarda) and for salesof slabs not cut-to-size by Pisani Brothers S.p.A. (Pisani). With respect to Guarda, we were unable to verify almost all sales priceinformation, including charges or adjustment information, as it was submittedin the response. We were also unable to verify any of the cost informationsubmitted for constructed value calculations. During verification of costs,the company was unable to explain the methodology used in its response.Additionally, the company could not provide support for its calculations.(See Comment 8). For these reasons, we have assigned Guarda a BIA rate that is based ona combination of adjusted constructed values as found in the petition,data collected during the Guarda verification relative to sales pricesto the United States, and verified information submitted by other producers.We could not use petition data exclusively for our BIA rate as it was apparentthat various parts of the constructed value computations found in the petitionrequired adjustment due to assumptions which are invalid for the Italiangranite industry. Specifically, the petition used actual size of blocksrather than the smaller commercial size in which grantie is sold. The petition'scalculations included freight which is typically paid by trading companiesin the Italian market. In addition, the petition including packing in determiningSGandamp;A and profit in its constructed value calculation, both of whichare inappropriate. Furthermore, as the U.S. prices for projects shown inthe petition did not specify material thicknesses, they could not be reasonablycompared to our adjusted, BIA constructed values. Finally, the petitionestablished rates only for cut-to-size sales while Guarda sold both cut-to-sizeand slabs in the U.S. during the POI. The use of certain information collected on-site during the Guarda verificationfor BIA should not be construed as a willingness on the part of the Departmentto reconstruct responses for respondents at verification. With regard to Pisani's sales of slabs not cut-to-size, the cost of productioninformation supplied by this company could not be reconciled to companydocumentation pertaining to slab production. (See Comment 8). For thisreason, we have used BIA to determine foreign market value for these sales.BIA is based on verified information for other companies, as the petitioncontained no information on the home market price of slabs. (See Comment8.) <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>Except where BIA was used, we based United States price for all U.S. saleson purchase price in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act. These saleswere made directly to unrelated customers in the United States prior toimportation. Under these circumstances, section 772(b) clearly requiresthat purchase price be used for determining the U.S. sales price. We calculated purchase price based on the ex-factory, f.o.b., c.i.f., orc.i.f., duty paid, packed prices to unrelated purchasers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions for foreign inland freight and handling, oceanfreight, marine insurance, U.S. duty and inland freight, as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>For rough slabs, slabs not cut-to-size, and tiles, we established separatecategories of ``such or similar'' merchandise, pursuant to section 771(16)of the Act, on the basis of form of material, type of stone, dimension,finish, edgework, anchoring and assembly work. Where there were no identical products in the home market with which tocompare products sold in the United States, we made adjustments to similarmerchanise to account for differences in the physical characteristics ofthe merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. Theseadjustments were based on differences in the costs of materials, directlabor and directly related factory overhead.The petitioner alleged that home market sales of slabs not cut-to-sizewere at prices below the cost of producing the merchandise. Having determinedthat these allegations were sufficiently documented, the Department initiateda cost investigation for Camplonghi Italia S.p.A. (Campolonghi), and FredaS.p.A. (Freda), Henraux S.p.A. (Henreaux), Euromarble S.p.A. (Euromarble),Formai and Mariani S.r.l. (Formai), and Psiani. We examined productioncosts which included all appropriate costs for materials, fabrication andgeneral expenses. The cost of production calculation for each respondentwas adjusted for those costs which were not appropriately quantified orvalued in the response. Except for certain types of stone sales by Euromarble,where we used constructed values, we found sufficient home market salesabove the cost of production to allow us to use these prices for foreignmarket value, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(A).For sales of rough slabs, face-finished slabs not cut-to-size, and tiles,we calculated foreign market value based on unpacked prices to unrelatedpurchasers in the home market, in accordance with section 773(a) of theAct. We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight. We madeadjustments for differences in circumstances of sale for credit expensespursuant to andSection;353.15(b) of our regulations, and for commissionson sales in the United States and in the home market pursuant to andSection;353.15(c)of our regulations. Where appropriate, we used indirect selling expensesto offset commissions. We deducted home market packing costs and addedthe packing costs incurred on sales to the United States.For cut-to-size projects, we calculated the foreign market value basedon constructed value in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act becausethere were no comparable sales in the home market by producers being investigated.The constructed value was based on the costs for the cut-to-size projectssold in the United States.In calculating general expenses for constructed value, we used U.S. sellingexpenses for the projects since these were such unique items that therewere no comparable home market or third country sales.Where the amount for general expenses was less then ten percent of thecost of materials and fabrication, we used the statutory minimum of tenpercent. Where the amount for profit was less than eight percent of thesum for the costs of materials, fabrication and general expenses, we usedthe statutory minimum of eight percent. We also added the cost of U.S.packing.When calculating constructed value, the respondents' submissions were used,except when all costs were not appropriately quantified or valued.The following adjustments were made for each respondent:<T3>For Campolonghi:</T3>(1) The block costs were reduced by the net exchange gains on purchases.(2) Cost of production was increased to reflect the accelerated methodof depreciation used in the respondent's accounting system.(3) The slabbing waste was changed from the overall 7 mm per cut to theactual slabbing waste computed by granite type.(4) Polishing costs were increased to reflect the cost from unrelated suppliersbased on commercial square meters.(5) Special works were adjusted, based on differences in quantities obtainedat verification.(6) The dimensioning waste was revised to reflect the amount computed foreach grant type.(7) General expenses were changed from the statutory minimum of 10 percentto include the actual general, administrative, and interest expenses ofthe company and the U.S. selling expenses for the projects. For calculatingthe cost for producing slabs, home market selling expenses were used.(8) Interest income related to short-term investments was included as anoffset to interest expenses.(9) The costs incurred by the related company, Granite Marketing Associates(GMA), were used for the blocks purchased by Campolonghi in calculatingthe cost of producting Campolonghi's slabs.<T3>For Freda:</T3>(1) The block and fabrication costs used to establish the costs of CapaoBonito granite in the respondent's submission were changed to the pricepaid for finished slabs, since the only block which was purchased by Fredawas sold one month later by the company.(2) The slabbing waste was changed from the overall 7 mm per cut to actualslab waste for each specific type of granite.(3) The price charged by a related company for sawing was adjusted to reflecta market value based on invoices of an unrelated fabricator.(4) The material costs for certain slab sizes, which, in the response,had been based on the block costs, were revised to reflect the actual costof slabs purchased because these sizes had not been sawn by the company.(5) The price of slabs purchased from Campolonghi were revised to reflectthe market price for the slabs.(6) The dimensioning waste was revised to reflect an average dimensioningwaste for the types of granite used in the projects under investigation.(7) General expenses were revised to include the actual general and administrativeexpenses, interest, and U.S. selling expenses for the projects. For calculatingthe cost of producing slabs, home market selling expenses were used.<T3>For Henraux:</T3>(1) The block costs were revised to reflect the cost of the actual graniteblocks used in the cut-to-size projects.(2) Where appropriate, general expenses were changed from the statutoryminimum of 10 percent to include the actual general and administrativeexpenses, interest, and U.S. selling expenses for the projects. For calculatingthe cost of producing slabs, home market selling expenses were used.<T3>For Savema S.p.A. (Savema):</T3>(1) The slabbing waste was adjusted to reflect the actual slabbing wastefor the specific types of granite the Department investigated during thecourse of the verification. The Department calculated an average slabbingwaste factor for those granite types which were included in project underinvestigation, but which the Department was unable to review during theverification.(2) Factory overhead costs for the flaming and polishing processes wererevised to reflect the losses which occur during the dimensioning stage.(3) General expenses were changed from the statutory minimum of 10 percentto the actual general and administrative expenses, interest expenses ofthe company, and the U.S. selling expenses for the projects.<T3>For Formai and Northern Granites S.r.l. (Northern Granites):</T3>(1) The cost of manufacturing, used as the basis for allocating general,administrative, and interest expenses, was revised by reclassifying certaincosts which were not considered by the Department to be part of the manufacturingcosts. U.S. selling expenses were included for the projects. For calculatingthe cost for producing slabs, home market selling expenses were used.<T3>For Pisani:</T3>(1) For projects using Balmoral Red granite, we used the weighted-averagecost of the blocks of Balmoral Red rather than the cost submitted in theresponse, which was based on the lowest-priced block, because the companywas unable to identify the actual blocks used in the projects.(2) The Department used BIA for slabbing waste because the response wastefigures could not be verified.(3) Sawing costs were increased by the average of the ``additional charges''noted on the sawing invoices which were reviewed during verification.(4) The verified average dimensioning waste was used instead of the dimensioningwaste submitted in the response.(5) The actual lease expense for the company's computer equipment was includedinstead of the imputed expenses submitted in the response.(6) Certain costs, such as expenses for production consultants, outsidedrafting, architectural consulting, quality control, and salaries and terminationpay funds for the production manager, project manager, and draftsman, wereincluded in the cost of manufacturing and deducted from the general andadministrative expenses.(7) The U.S. selling expenses were included in general expenses for theprojects. For calculating cost of producing slabs, home market sellingexpenses were used.(8) General and administrative expenses and interest expenses were basedon the amounts on the financial statements, appropriately adjusted.<T3>For Euromarble:</T3>(1) The material cost and fabrication costs were revised to reflect thecost of blocks and special works resubmitted by the respondent at the verificationfor some of the cut-to-size projects.(2) The dimensioning waste factor was revised to reflect a weighted-averagewaste factor.(3) Factory overhead was revised to include certain expenses, such as rentand other industrial costs, in the calculation of overhead expenses.(4) General and administrative expenses, including financial expenses,were revised to reflect the information on their 1987 financial statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>We made currency conversions as of the date of sale in accordance withsection 353.56(a)(1) of the Regulations. All currency conversions weremade at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>As provided in section 776(a) of the Act, and except where noted, we verifiedall information used in reaching the final determination in this investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1:</T3> Henraux and Savema state that the Department shouldnot make an adjustment for commissions paid to their related companies.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree. At verification, the Department ascertainedthat these commissions were paid to related companies. Therefore, we madeno adjustment for these commissions in our final determination.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Henraux and Savema contend that the Department maynot offset commissions paid on home market slab sales with indirect sellingexpenses incurred in Italy for sales to the United States.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. The Act and regulations place no geographictest on the commission offset. In our preliminary and final determinations,the Department offset commissions paid on home market sales with indirectselling expenses incurred in connection with sales to the U.S. market,including those incurred in Italy. The Department did not use indirectselling expenses incurred in home market sales of slabs to offset commissionspaid on sales in the same market. See <T3>Silver Reed </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-37 (CIT, March 18, 1988).<T3>Comment 3: </T3>Campolonghi, Formai, Henraux and Savema point out thatthe Department erred in using 1987 exchange rates for certain sales ofcut-to-size projects made in 1986.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree. In its final determination, the Departmenthas used the proper exchange rates for these sales.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>Euromarble and Henraux point out that, for certainof their slab sales, the Department erred in calculating a single weighted-averageforeign market value for each type of stone, regardless of thickness, inour preliminary determination.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree. The Department has corrected this calculationfor purposes of our final determination by calculating individual weighted-averageforeign market values for different thicknesses of stone.<T3>Comment 5: </T3>Respondents contend that the Department should calculateseparate margins for various groups of companies which the Department believesare related to Campolonghi and Formai.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Although not expressly required by the Act, theDepartment has a long-standing practice of calculating a separate dumpingmargin for each manufacturer or exporter investigated. The issue, then,is whether companies of the Campolonghi group and companies of the Formaigroup constitute separate manufacturers or exporters for purposes of thedumping law. We believe that, under the facts present on the record, thecompanies within each of these groups of companies are not separate, andit is appropriate to calculate a single, weighted-average margin for eachgroup of firms. The administrative record establishes close, intertwined relationshipsbetween the companies within both the Campolonghi group and the Formaigroup. Each group is predominantly owned by a small group of individualsand the companies in each group share common boards of directors. Transactionshave taken place between companies within each of these groups during theperiod of investigation. The various production facilities within eachgroup share the same type of equipment, so it would not be necessary toretool a particular plant's facilities before implementing a decision torestructure manufacturing priorities within either group. Given these facts,we believe it would be incorrect to conclude that each of these entitiesconstitutes separate manufacturers or exporters under the dumping law.Therefore, we have treated the Campolonghi group of companies and the Formaigroup of companies each as a single entity for purposes of determininga dumping margin. <T3>Comment 6: </T3>Respondents contend that the Department's final determinationshould specify, by company, what percentage of sales by each respondentwas made at less than fair value. Respondents believe that this would assistthe ITC in its analysis of injury from imports of merchandise sold at lessthan fair value. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We believe this unnecessary. We always make allprivileged and business proprietary information in our files availableto the ITC, if requested. <T3>Comment 7: </T3>Respondents argue that the Department may not use anyof petitioner's confidential data as BIA since petitioner has not submittedthis data in accordance with the Department's requirements. Respondentsalso argue that petitioner has not properly summarized its confidentialdata. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have determined that petitioner has properlysubmitted its business proprietary data. Where appropriate, we have useddata provided in the petition as BIA. <T3>Comment 8: </T3>Petitioner argues that because respondents' data containnumerous errors, inconsistencies and omissions, the Department should baseits final determination on the BIA, which is the data submitted by petitioner.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Except for all sales by Guarda and sales of slabsnot cut-to-size by Pisani, the Department considers the responses of theother companies to be verified. We have reported in our verification reportsall significant issues raised at the verification of these other companies,our verification methods, and discrepancies found. We do not, however,consider the errors, inconsistencies and omissions we found to be of afrequency or magnitude to warrant rejecting the data submitted by thesecompanies and using petitioner's data as BIA. With respect to Guarda, during our attempted verification of its salesand cost responses, we found that the extent of the errors, inconsistenciesand omissions in these responses did not permit satisfactory analysis orverification. For example, with regard to Guarda's cost response: 1. Materials _materials could not be traced to actual inputs for any of the projects;_certain costs, e.g., bank charges, were omitted; _slabs taken out of inventory were not included in the material costs;_the blocks included in one project were removed from inventory one daybefore the project was shipped. 2. Sawing _five different rates of sawing waste were used by the respondent in itsresponse, depending upon the hardness of the stone. However, during verification,the company calculated an average rate; _the average rate used was an estimate for 1987 since actual 1987 datawas not available. Guarda estimated that the slabbing waste in 1987 waslower than in 1986. 3. Fabrication _the costs for honing, dimension cutting, and special works were basedon estimated production and usage rates, which the company could not support;_costs calculated during verification did not agree with the response norcould these costs be verified; _subcontractors' costs for extra thicknesses were not included; _special works were not included in the response. The company providedestimates during verification. 4. Dimension Waste _the company could not explain the dimension waste calculation used inthe response; _a recalculated dimension waste factor was based on estimates of the ``costof making a polished edge in special work.'' The company could not explainthe relationship between these costs and dimensioning costs, nor couldthey support them. Regarding Guarda's sales response: 1. Guarda waited until verification to revise the originally reported amountsfor quantity and value of sales.  2. On three out of five projects under investigation, Guarda miscalculatedthe total volume of the investigated granite. This resulted in discrepanciesin the sales price of three sales.3. Guarda could not explain its reported packing expenses.4. Reported credit expenses were based on the terms stated on the invoicerather than the actual credit period.5. Guarda used the wrong interest rate to calculate credit expenses.6. Guarda failed to provide any explanation of indirect selling expensesuntil verification. In addition to the questionnaire, this informationwas specifically requested by the Department in deficiency letters on November24 and December 11, 1987.For costs of Pisani's slabs not cut-to-size, the following discrepancieswere noted regarding its cost response:1. Invoices for block purchases used to establish the cost of materialswere dated after the sawing and finishing invoices and, therefore, couldnot have been the actual invoices for the blocks used to produce the slabsin the reported sale.2. Invoices used for sawing and finishing were for blocks other than thoseidentified in the response.3. Invoices for sawing and finishing could not be reconciled to the company'srecords.4. Sawing costs for one sale were based on November 1985 costs. No slabswere in inventory for this type of granite as of June 30, 1986. The originof the materials that were used could not be explained.5. The same invoice as used to calculate the cost of production for slabssold in the U.S. and for slabs sold in Italy.Faced with responses containing numerous fundamental flaws, the Departmentcould not properly base its determination on the information submittedby Guarda or information on cost of production submitted by Pisani. Itis not acceptable, in such situations, that the Department bear the responsibilityfor attempting to identify and perform the numerous and substantial recalculationsnecessary for the development of accurate sales and cost of productiondata. Such a role would place too great a burden on the resources of theDepartment under the time constraints and procedural framework of thisinvestigation. As stated in <T3>Photo Albums and Filler Pages from Korea; Final Determination of Salesat Less Than Fair Value </T3>(50 FR 43754, October 29, 1985): ``[I]t isthe obligation of respondents to provide an accurate and complete responseprior to verification so that the Department may have the opportunity tofully analyze the information and other parties are able to review andcomment on it.'' A respondent cannot shift this burden to the Departmentby submitting incomplete and inaccurate information and expect the Departmentto correct its response during the course of verification. Verificationis intended to establish the accuracy of a response rather than to reconstructthe information to fit the requirements of the Department or to performthe recalculations necessary to develop accurate information. Nevertheless,as discussed above in the ``Fair Value Comparisons'' section of this noticedue to lack of information in the petition, certain information collectedat verification was used as BIA.<T3>Comment 9:</T3> Petitioner asserts that the Department has not consideredat least 60 percent of exports from Italy during the period of investigation(POI) as required by andSection;353.38(a) of the Commerce Regulations, 19CFR 353.38(a).<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Under normal circumstances, we do look at 60 percentof the dollar value of exports. However, given the fact that many of thesales under investigation consisted of long-term projects for which constructedvalues had to be calculated, the Department believed it was appropriateto amend its typical practice to fit the somewhat atypical circumstancesof this case. After analyzing the constructed value submissions for cut-to-sizegranite slab projects, it was apparent that respondents had not furnishedactual cost data for almost all of their larger project sales made duringthe POI (March 1, 1987 through August 31, 1987). This was because theseprojects had not been completed by the time the responses were due. Onthe basis that such data might not be sufficently representative, we extendedthe POI back to January, 1987 and requested respondents to report constructedvalue information for all projects completed by November 30, 1987. Moreover,to capture the actual costs of some larger cut-to-size porjects (i.e.,those valued at approximately $500,000 or more), we also requested informationon some projects sold as early as July 1986. Consequently, our POI forcut-to-size granite slabs is January 1, 1987 through August 31, 1987 plus,some larger projects sold as early as July, 1986, if completed by November30, 1987. By using these as our criteria, we have captured over 60 percentof total sales completed within the POI.<T3>Comment 10: </T3>Petitioner argues that, because the U.S. dollar hasdeclined against the Italian lira, the Department should include currencyexchange costs as a direct expense for sales to the United States.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have determined that there is no basis in theAct or in the regulations for such an adjustment. Section 353.56(a)(1)of our regulations stipulates that any necessary conversion of a foreigncurrency into its equivalent in United States currency will be ``as ofthe date of purchase or agreement to purchase, if the purchase price isan element of the comparison.'' Therefore, it is not the Department's policyto take into account differences in home market currency revenue basedon currency fluctuations in calculating direct selling expenses, regardlessof whether the fluctuations are favorable of unfavorable.<T3>Comment 11: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should compareU.S. slab sales to verified constructed values.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. Since we found that all respondents,except for Euromarble in certain instances and Pisani and Guarda, had sufficienthome market sales at prices above their costs of production, we have noreason to make comparisons on anything other than a price-to-price basis.<T3>Comment 12: </T3>Petitioner has alleged that processors related tothe respondents are ``dumping'' their input materials and fabrication services.Petitioner contends, therefore, that the Department should initiate costinvestigations of these processors.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. For any element of value included inconstructed value, section 773(e)(2) of the Act requires the Departmentto determine whether prices charged by related parties fairly reflect theamount usually reflected in sales to unrelated parties in the market underconsideration. Therefore, when these materials and fabrication servicesare provided at market rates, the Act neither requires nor allows us todo a cost analysis of these inputs.<T3>Comment 13: </T3>Respondents state that the Department must eliminatefrom its analysis the nine percent additional slab loss that it presumedexisted with respect to Henraux and the other respondents and which wasapplied in the preliminary determination.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department verified waste losses for the respondentswho used a slab waste factor and dimensioning waste factor as a basis tocalculate their total cost of production for the projects. These companieswere Campolonghi-Freda, Savema, Euromarble, Pisani and Guarda. In all cases,except Guarda (whose response could not be verified), the slabbing wastefactor and/or the dimensioning waste factor, which was documented at verification,was markedly higher than the losses reported in the response. Therefore,the Department used the actual waste losses obtained at verification asa basis for its final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Constructed Value Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 14: </T3>The respondents argue that the Department incorrectlyused imputed credit costs for calculating general expenses in the preliminarydetermination. They contend that the Department is bound to use actualexpenses in its constructed value. The respondents cite cases and determinationswhich they allege support this position. They are <T3>Hercules Inc. v. United States, Al Tech Speciality Steel Corp. v. UnitedStates, Industrial Nitrocellulose from France, Tubeless Steel Disc Wheelsfrom Brazil, Titanium Sponge from Japan </T3>and <T3>Oil Country Tubular Goods from Israel</T3> in support of this position.The respondents further state that actual expenses should be used in thefinal determination.The petitioner states that it is essential for the Department to includeimputed credit expenses in the constructed value calculations, becausesuch expenses are imputed in the U.S. price. The petitioner further statesthat the Department's failure to include such imputed credit expenses wouldresult in an improper comparison.The petitioner claims that the Department should follow its usual methodologyand include the ``credit expense'' as a selling expense in the constructedvalue.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department followed its usual methodology andincluded an imputed credit expense as part of selling expenses in constructedvalue. This practice was recently upheld in <T3>Silver Reed v. United States, </T3>Slip. Op. 88-5 (CIT, January 12,1988). In the Department's view, this credit expense reflects the costsincurred by the company (costs of debt and equity) in financing its accountsreceivable for the product. To avoid double-counting, the portion of actualinterest expense attributable to accounts receivable was deducted fromtotal interest charges.<T3>Comment 15: </T3>The respondents argue that the Department must usethe home market selling expense because section 773(e) of the Act requiresthat general expenses be use ``equal to that usually reflected in salesof merchandise of the same general class or kind as the merchandise underconsideration which are made by producers in the country of exportation.''Petitioner claims that U.S. selling expenses should be used because (1)home market selling expenses have not been verified, and (2) the salesin the home market for the products under investigation are very dissimilarfrom the U.S. sales.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree that generally the Department should usehome market selling expenses in calculating constructed value. With respectto sales of cut-to-size projects, however, the Department determined that,due to the uniqueness of the merchandise, there was no comparability betweensales in the home market and sales in the U.S. Therefore, the Departmentused the U.S. selling expenses as a surrogate for each individual U.S.project for which a constructed value was computed. The Department usedhome market selling expenses for slabs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Constructed Value/Cost Comments_Henraux</ITAG><T3>Comment 16: </T3>The petitioner argues that Henraux's raw block costsare underreported because Henraux used the moving average cost method inits response. The petitioner further states that the Department must usethe respondent's highest raw material costs for the final determination.Henraux argues that changing from the moving average inventory method tothe cost for specific blocks used for cut-to-size projects actually reducedHenraux's material costs.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The moving average inventory method was not usedbecause it averaged the costs of the current period with costs from priorperiods. Using Henraux's accounting system, we were able to identify specificallythe blocks used on each cut-to-size project. Therefore, the Departmentused the cost of the specifically identified blocks for the final determination.The effect was to increase the cost of some projects and to decrease thecost of others.<T3>Comment 17: </T3>The petitioner argues that, if Henraux used an inflatedallocation of cost to marble and to granite with thicknesses over 2\1/2\inches, it would unjustifiably reduce the constructed value for the projects.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The allocations of the costs for marble and granitewith thicknesses over 2\1/2\ inches for the projects were reviewed at verification.We found no inflated allocations.<T3>Comment 18: </T3>The petitioner argues that costs of production ofHenraux's related company, Lavorazioni, rather than the invoiced prices,should be used for the cut-to-size projects. The petitioner further statesthat comparing related party invoices to unrelated party invoices is questionablebecause petitioner believes that the fabrication input of unrelated partiesis being provided at less than cost. Respondent states that all Lavorazionisales are to Henraux. The respondent argues that for purposes of constructedvalue, the related party prices should be used if they reflect prevailingmarket prices offered by other suppliers.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>For purposes of constructed value, we have usedthe transfer prices of the related company, in accordance with section773(e)(2) of the Act, since these prices were comparable to prices chargedby unrelated suppliers.For purposes of the cost of production of slabs, we would ordinarily usethe cost of the input from related companies. However, since the transferprices presented in Henraux's response were equivalent to the cost of production,the Department did not revise the response.<T3>Comment 19: </T3>The petitioner argues that the sawing loss attributedto the cost of production for Henraux's granite slabs appears to be unsubstantiated,theoretical waste and does not account for breakage or second quality slabs.Henraux states that it accounted fully for all waste costs.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Henraux measures the usable size of the graniteblocks and computes the actual sawing waste for the slabs in its records.Therefore, the actual sawing waste was used in the final determinationfor the cost of production for slabs, rather than the theoretical wastereported in its original response.<T3>Comment 20: </T3>The petitioner argues that the administrative recordindicates that the cost of dimensioning waste for the cut-to-size projectshas not been verified and, therefore, the Department should use the bestinformation otherwise available.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Total material cost was used for the cut-to-sizeprojects. Therefore, the Department did not need to measure the dimensionwaste in calculating constructed value.<T3>Comment 21: </T3>Petitioner questions whether the factory overheadfor Henraux was calculated properly. Petitioner argues that the overheadassigned to the projects appears to be low and, therefore, the highest,verified factory overhead amount should be used. Henraux states that itaccurately included all overhead costs in its constructed value calculations.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The factory overhead in Henraux's response, includingquality control, maintenance, depreciation, yard handling, block selection,and indirect salaries, was assigned to various aspects of the cost of cut-to-sizeprojects such as block cost and surface treatment. Other factory overheaditems, such as internal transport, handling, insurance, and consumablematerial, were assigned to the projects and listed in the costs separately.Therefore, no adjustments were necessary.<T3>Comment 22: </T3>Petitioner states that the respondent has not usedthe most similar merchandise for the difference in merchandise calculationsand, therefore, the petitioner's data should be used.Henraux has submitted several alternative product comparisons.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree with petitioner as regards use of BIA.For purposes of comparisons, we have used that slab, not cut-to-size, foundto be most similar to the slab sold to the United States. This comparisonis different from that made at the time of our preliminary determination.<T3>Comment 23: </T3>Petitioner argues that all costs may not be includedfor one project for which the material was sold to an independent contractorand then repurchased as completed cut-to-size pieces. The respondent statesthat all costs of the project were included in the constructed value.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with the respondent. At verification, wedetermined that granite blocks were purchased for the project. A portionof the blocks were sawn into slabs and polished prior to the sale of theslabs and the sale of the remaining blocks to an unrelated supplier. Theamount received from the supplier was deducted only from the material cost(not the total value which would include the costs of material and fabrication)to arrive at a negative balance for the material cost. However, since thecost of processing by Henraux and Henraux Lavorazioni and the cost of repurchasingthe finished product from the unrelated supplier were included in totalcost, the amount received from the sale of the slabs and blocks shouldhave been deducted from the total cost. The net effect would have beenthe same without giving the appearance of obtaining a profit on the saleof material.<ITAG tagnum="84">Constructed Value/Cost Comments_Campolonghi</ITAG><T3>Comment 24: </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department should usethe market price of the granite block purchased by Campolonghi from itsrelated company, Granite Marketing Associates (GMA). The market price shouldbe the price charged to unrelated customers. The petitioner further statesthat distribution costs should not be deducted from the sales price becausethe statute requires that every element of value reflected in sales tounrelated parties be included in the price to unrelated parties.The respondent states that commissions and handling fees incurred for salesto unrelated companies are not incurred for sales to Campolonghi and, therefore,should be deducted from the sales price to unrelated companies when comparingthe prices.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We do not need to address this issue. The applicationof either measure of price has no impact on the margins for the projects.<T3>Comment 25:</T3> The petitioner states the Department must use thehighest block prices verified for Campolonghi, because the Department wasunable to obtain permission from the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Commerceto verify the cost of blocks purchased and sold to Campolonghi by GMA.Campolonghi states that both it and GMA have cooperated fully in attemptingto obtain permission to verify the records in Switzerland. Campolonghifurther states that it should not be penalized for circumstances over whichit has no control. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We were granted permission to verify the cost andsales records of GMA in Switzerland and based the final determination onverified data. <T3>Comment 26:</T3> The petitioner argues that the Department must includeall costs of GMA for the granite blocks obtained from them for the costof production for slab sales. Campolonghi argues that the transfer price should be used for the costof production. The respondent states there is no legal or logical justificationfor the Department using related party prices in its cost of productionanalysis but not in its constructed value calculations. The respondentrefers to <T3>Washington Red Raspberry Commission v. United States,</T3> 657 F. Supp.537 (CIT, 1987). <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department used the costs incurred by GMA incomputing the cost of production for the slab sales. The constructed valuerelated party provision contained in section 773(e)(2) is not directlyapplicable to cost of production calculations, because, by its terms itonly refers to constructed value calculations. See, <T3>Mirrors in Stock Sheet and Lehr End Sizes from the Federal Republicof Germany</T3> 51 FR 43403 (1986). The Department based its cost of productioncalculations on ``generally accepted accounting principles.'' Accordingto these principles, when one company is at least 50 percent owned by anothercompany, the costs are based on the consolidated financial informationof the two companies. <T3>Comment 27:</T3> The petitioner argues that a certain unaccounted foramount of money in the respondent's revised methodology for special worksshould be allocated to the granite sold during the period of investigation.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have adjusted the ``special works'' in the responsein accordance with the revised calculation obtained at verification. Approximatelyone half of the difference was not assigned to specific special works operations.This amount was so insignificant that it would have no effect on the costof the special works. <T3>Comment 28:</T3> Petitioner states that the highest verified dimensionwaste factor must be used for the final determination, rather than theamounts provided by Campolonghi prior to verification. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>During the course of the verification, actual dimensioningwaste for each granite type used in the projects was obtained. This informationwas tested against underlying documentation and was used in the final determination.For those granite types for which a specific waste loss was not ascertained,we applied the weighted-average waste loss obtained at verification. <T3>Comment 29:</T3> The petitioner argues that the Department should usethe highest verified sawing waste factor in the final determination. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>Calculations related to this loss factor were testedextensively against underlying documentation for two of the stone typesand verified. Therefore, the sawing waste factor computed for each stonetype was used in the final determination. <T3>Comment 30:</T3> The petitioner argues that the polishing cost forthe final determination must be based on commercial square meters insteadof actual square meters. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree and have used the unit cost based on commercialsquare meters in the final determination. <T3>Comment 31:</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should not acceptthe deduction from selling, general and administrative expenses of legalexpenses that the respondents incurred in the antidumping investigation.Respondent argues these expenses should not be included because they relateto future sales and not to sales under investigation. The respondent refersto <T3>Industrial Nitrocellulose from France</T3> (51 FR 43230, December 1,1986) and <T3>Certain Steel Pipes and Tubes from Japan</T3> (48 FR 1206, January11, 1983). <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with respondents. Following our precedentsin <T3>Industrial Nitrocellulose</T3> and <T3>Steel Pipes and Tubes</T3> and <T3>Televisions from Japan</T3> (53 FR 4050, February 11, 1988), the Departmenthas not included the expenses incurred by Campolonghi in defending theantidumping investigation. <T3>Comment 32:</T3> The petitioner argues that the Department should usethe accelerated depreciation used by the company in its accounting recordsinstead of the straight line depreciation calculated for the submission.The respondent states the company used a systematic method of depreciationfor the response instead of the voluntary accelerated method used to defercorporate tax liability. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department applied the method of depreciationwhich was the method used by the company in its accounting records andaccepted in Italy for financial statement purposes. <T3>Comment 33: </T3>Petitioner argues the overall cost should be increasedat least 34 percent to correct respondent's underreporting of raw materialcosts as a result of the computation of dimension waste. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>For the final determination, the dimension wastefactor has been computed for each granite type on the basis of the percentageof the quantity of waste to the ouput of material quantities from the dimensioningprocess. This factor was then applied to the cost of the project incurredprior to the dimension process in order to obtain a dimension waste cost.Since the factor used was based on verified quantities of output, an additionalincrease in cost is not warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Constructed Value/Cost Comments_Freda</ITAG><T3>Comment 34: </T3>Petitioner argues that Freda's purchases of graniteblocks from its related company, Campolonghi, should not be relied uponfor the final determination. Petitioner states that Freda made all of itspurchases of granite blocks from related companies, and cites one instancewhere Freda purchased granite block from Campolonghi and resold it onemonth later at a profit. Petitioner states that the calculation of Freda'sconstructed value is overwhelmingly dependent on the raw material costused for granite block. If this price is inaccurate, the Department mustincrease Freda's raw material costs to reflect market values.Freda states that the block it purchased from the Campolonghi and soldto a third unrelated slabbing company for a higher price one month laterwas not sold to that slabbing company for its own production process. Fredarequired the third company to purchase the block. The block had been sentto this company for conversion into slabs for Freda's use. As the the slabswere found to be unsatisfactory, Freda billed the slabbing company thecost of the block plus a profit. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department analyzed the block and slab pricespaid by Freda to Campolonghi and compared these to invoice prices of thesame type and size of product purchased from unrelated companies. We foundthat unrelated companies charged a higher price. Therefore, in accordancewith section 773(e)(2), the Department increased Freda's material costsby the difference between the invoice prices between Freda and Campolonghiand the invoice prices for the same material for transactions between unrelatedcompanies, when exact comparisons could be made. The Department used anaverage of these comparisons to increase material costs for the granitetypes for which an exact comparison could not be found.The details of the purchase of the block and its resale one month laterwere not provided to the Department during Verification and, therefore,could not be verified. <T3/><T3>Comment 35: </T3>Petitioner argues that constructed values for a significantnumber of projects were calculated erroneously, because Freda reportedthe cost of granite blocks from related companies rather than the costof finished slabs purchased from unrelated companies.<T3/><T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department revised the material costs to reflectarm's length transaction prices using the slabs that had been purchasedand used for the projects instead of the granite blocks which had not actuallybeen sawn and finished by the company for the projects.<T3/><T3>Comment 36: </T3>Petitioner argues that Freda stated that its blockvendor credits Freda's account for broken, defective, or otherwise unusableslabs. Freda, however, provided no documentation to support this statement.The petitioner further states that undocumented comments by a respondentshould not be considered verified information or relied upon for the finaldetermination, and that the sawing waste factor of respondent should bediscarded or at least increased for the broken, defective or unsuable slabs.<T3/><T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department used the actual verified slab wastefor those specific granite types used in the projects under investigationfor its final determination. <T3/><T3>Comment 37: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department verified thepolishing costs for only one type of granite and, therefore, the unverifiednature of Freda's other cost of production requires that the overall costof production be determined by using petitioner's information as the bestinformation available.<T3/><T3>DOC Position: </T3>When all or some elements of specific types of reportedcosts could not be verified, the Department made adjustments based on informationdeveloped at verification. However, these adjustments were confined tolimited areas. Therefore, the Department accepted the remainder of Freda'sresponse which could be verified.<T3/><T3>Comment 38: </T3>Petitioner states that the Department's verificationreport shows that the dimensioning waste factor used by Freda is incorrect.The petitioner further states that the verification report indicated thatthe amount calculated by respondent at verification must be increased bynetting the beginning cut-to-size granite inventory against net graniteoutput. The report then states that the respondent did not make such beginningcut-to-size inventory figures available to the Department at verification.Petitioner states that this refusal to cooperate with the Department'sverifiers must lead the Department to discard the figures provided by respondent.Freda argues that the opening cut-to-size slab inventory for 1987 was notincluded in its waste calculations because the inventory included noneof the granite types subject to the investigation. Moreover, the openinginventory was not provided to the Department during verification becauseit was not requested by the Department at that time. Respondent furtherstates that Freda personnel were cooperative with Department personneland were willing to answer questions and recalculate or revise certaindata as requested by the Department during the verification process. <T3/><T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department requested that Freda provide itsdimensioning waste calculation during verification. Beginning inventoryis one of the factors which must be considered for this calculation. Therefore,the company should have provided this information to the Department duringverification. Since Freda did not do so, the Department had to rely ona BIA number for this component. As BIA, the Department derived a dimensioning waste factor by calculating``beginning inventory'' based on the company's financial statements. Afteradjusting the waste factor for the beginning inventory, the Departmentapplied the company's dimensioning waste factors to the company's costs.<ITAG tagnum="85">Constructed Value/Cost Comments_Formai and Northern Granites </ITAG><T3>Comment 39:</T3> The petitioner alleges that material costs were notverified for Formai and Northern Granites because the companies could nottrace raw granite blocks from purchase to the completion of cut-to-sizeprojects and certain critical documentation, such as invoices and endinginventory, were not provided. Therefore, the material costs were not verifiedand the Department should use ``best information.'' <T3>DOC Position:</T3> The Department performed various verification proceduresto determine whether all materials used for a project were included inthe cost of production. The Department inspected the official ``block purchasedbook'', which the company is required to maintain for the Italy Tax Authority,and traced actual invoices of the fabricators from cut-to-size pieces toslabs and blocks for the projects. The Department concluded that all materialcosts were included in the projects reviewed. <T3>Comment 40:</T3> The petitioner contends that movement expenses relatedto bringing the block to the company and exchange gains and losses of thecompany should be included in fabrication expenses for cut-to-size graniteand for slabs. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> The movement expenses related to bringing the blockto the company were included as material costs since they were incurredin order to make the material available for use in production. These wereappropriately classified as material costs. The exchange gains and losses related to material purchases could not besegregated from the company's overall exchange gains and losses. However,the net amount was so insignificant as not to have an effect on the costof materials. <T3>Comment 41:</T3> Petitioner argues that since the cost of productionof Northern Granites was higher than the prices charged by unrelated contractorsfor sawing block, the actual costs should be used. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> In calculating constructed value for cut-to-sizeprojects, the Department used the invoice prices between Formai and NorthernGranites (Formai's related company) for sawing performed by Northern Granites,pursuant to section 773(e)(2), since these prices were comparable to pricespaid to unrelated companies. For cost of production purposes, the Departmentused respondent's submission which was based on transfer price, since transferprice was equivalent to cost. <T3>Comment 42:</T3> Petitioner states that there is no evidence on therecord that Formai's and Northern Granite's selling, general and administrativeexpenses were satisfactorily verified. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> The information presented in Formai's response wasreconciled to the underlying records of both companies. However, certaincosts included in the cost of manufacturing, which was the basis used toallocate the Gandamp;A expenses, were misclassified by Formai. Therefore,the Department adjusted the calculation by reclassifying these expenses.<T3>Comment 43:</T3> The petitioner claims that the project included inFormai's response, which was not completed by November 30, 1987, shouldnot be excluded because the Department is not reviewing sixty percent ofrespondents' U.S. exports during the period of investigation. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> As explained in response to comment 9, the Departmentobtained information on 60 percent of the sales completed during the POI.In our view, this information is sufficient to determine whether Italiangranite is being, or is likely to be, sold at less than fair value. Therefore,we have not considered this additional sale by Formai. <ITAG tagnum="84">Constructed Value/Cost Comments for Euromarble </ITAG><T3>Comment 44:</T3> Petitioner contends that, for the final determination,the Department should not rely on any data submitted by Euromarble, butshould rely on the BIA. Petitioner bases this contention on the beliefthat Euromarble failed to establish the reliability and credibility ofits data during verification. Although Euromarble resubmitted its data,correcting the specific numbers verified by the Department, the Departmentshould not assume that unverified information resubmitted by the respondentis correct. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> The Department verified the actual costs incurredby Euromarble for purposes of the final determination. The Department didnot use the unverified information submitted by the respondent. <T3>Comment 45:</T3> Petitioner contends that Euromarble initially failedto submit all of the costs incurred under factory overhead and generalexpenses for the granite under investigation. The corrected figures shouldbe used in the final determination, if the Department does not rely onthe best information available, as petitioner insists. Respondent contends that Euromarble does not engage in drafting of anykind either before or after a U.S. sale is made. Since Euromarble revisedoverhead costs and general expenses during the verification, the Departmentshould use these verified expenses. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> Neither Euromarble's submission nor its revisedcalculations included certain factory overhead expenses, such as rent andother industrial costs. Therefore, the Department included these amountswhich it obtained during the course of verification and allocated theseexpenses based on the ``cost of sales'' in 1987. <T3>Comment 46: </T3>Petitioner contends that all companies incur a certainamount of additional waste at the slabbing stage due to breakage, slabscuts whose veining makes them second quality slabs, and other factors.This additional waste must be accounted for in the final determination,since none of this additional waste is accounted for by respondent's theoreticalwaste figure. Respondent contends that the Department scrutinized Euromarble'sslabbing production data and reviewed information showing that sawing wastefigures used by Euromarble were reasonable and accurate. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department examined actual slabbing waste forsix different types of granite during the verification and reviewed actualslabbing waste for some cut-to-size projects. Based on this analysis, theaverage waste factor used by the respondent was confirmed. <T3>Comment 47: </T3>Petitioner contends that the dimensioning waste percentagesexamined by the Department are not necessarily indicative of the percentagesexperienced on projects other than the two projects examined at verification.Therefore, if the Department uses the dimensioning waste factor submittedby the respondent, at a minimum, the Department should use the highestpercentage of dimensioning waste factor submitted by the respondent. Euromarble contends that the waste figures used in the submission wereconservative and reasonable, as the sample transactions that the Departmentexamined during verification demonstrated. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department's analysis of dimensional cuttingwaste, during and subsequent to verification, reflected a higher overalldimensioning waste than the estimated average used by the respondent inits submissions. Therefore, a revised weighted-average waste factor wasused for the final determination. <T3>Comment 48: </T3>Petitioner contends that Euromarble's claim for areduction in its costs, based on its related company overcharging for sawingthree centimeter thick slabs for one type of granite, should not be accepted.There is no indication in the verification report whether the revised pricefor this sawing was a reasonable market value. Respondent contends that the revised price, in fact, reflected market pricesas demonstrated to the Department during verification. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department verified the amount claimed throughthe published price list for the subcontracting service and then comparedthis amount to other invoices for the same or similar service. After thisanalysis, the Department concluded that the amount was actually higherthan the price that should have been charged and, therefore, accepted Euromarble'sclaim. <ITAG tagnum="84">Constructed Value/Cost Comments for Savema </ITAG><T3>Comment 49: </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department should notuse Savema's theoretical sawing waste figures to determine the amount ofcubic meter raw block which was necessary to produce a square meter offinished granite, because such information was not verified. Instead thepetitioner's information or the average sawing waste for the three granitetypes which were verified should be used. The respondent argues that the slabbing waste used in the submission wasnot theoretical. The amount used in the response, the company claims, wasthe average sawing waste rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter andthat this sawing waste was tested at verification by a physical measurement.Therefore, the submission should be used. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department calculated the slabbing waste forthree granite types from documentation provided by the company during verificationand adjusted the material cost for those projects which used the granitetypes. The slabbing waste for all three types, which accounted for a substantialamount of the granite used in the projects under investigation, were higherthan the slabbing waste reported in the submission. The Department, therefore,used a weighted-average slabbing waste based on these granite types. <T3>Comment 50: </T3>The petitioner claims that the Department should accountfor the exchange losses in the material costs calculations. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The exchange losses related to material purchaseswere so insignificant that there was no effect on the costs of the materials.<T3>Comment 51: </T3>The petitioner claims that the verification reportdoes not state whether the sawing services, finishing, dimensioning, dimensioningwaste and subcontract labor were successfully verified. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>During verification the Department did not noteany methodological questions or issues related to the reconciliation ofthe information presented in the response with the data maintained in thebooks of the company in its ordinary course of business. The dimensioningwaste for the granite types verified by the Department confirmed the averagedimensioning waste used by the respondent. <T3>Comment 52: </T3>The petitioner argues that, in some cases, the allocationmethod used to attribute factory overhead to different departments boreno relationship to the use of the costs. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> The Department tested the allocation of overheadusing a method which appeared to be more reflective of the actual usageof specific overhead costs and found that this method did not yield a differentresult in the method used by the respondent.<T3>Comment 53:</T3> The petitioner claims that certain technical expenses,such as drafting shop tickets and other services, should be project-relatedand should, therefore, be included in the cost of manufacturing, ratherthan general expenses. Since Savema could not identify these services witha project, the full amount should be included and allocated to the projects.Savema contends that the expenses recorded are properly classified as generalexpenses, because:(1) Technical services and administrative functions are performed by anunreleated company which billed for both of these services in one amountnot segregated as to the administrative or to the technical services;(2) The company pays an even, fixed administrative fee; and (3) Certain drafting costs are related to bids, not specific projects.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> The Department did not revise the respondent's submissionsince the amount of technical services which were related to a specificproject and which would have been considered part of the cost of manufacturing,could not be determined.<ITAG tagnum="84">Constructed Value/Cost Comments for Pisani</ITAG><T3>Comment 54:</T3> Respondent claims that some of the deficiencies notedduring verification related to the dimensioning waste are insignificantand other statements are in error. For example, although the Departmentstates that there are no sales made from miscellaneous inventory, the companydid, in fact, make some sales. Also, according to the information attributedto one project, the full amount of the block used in that project shouldnot be attributed to the project since, in fact, the block was defective.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> The Department's verification report summarizesthe information obtained during verification. Although there may be additionalfacts related to some of the statements made in the report, the companydid not provide such information during verification nor documentationto support such statements. Therefore, any information submitted is untimely.We base our final determination on verified information.<T3>Comment 55:</T3> The petitioner argues that, since the slabbing wastecould not be verified for Pisani, the Department should use the total wastefor the two granite types which were obtained during verification.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> Because the Department could not verify that thetotal output of slabs from the sawing process were usable slabs for thecut-to-size projects, the Department had to resort to best informationavailable. As BIA, the Department based the slabbing waste on the overallwaste for the two granite types reviewed during verification and a thirdtype analyzed subsequent to verification. The Department deducted the dimensioningwaste from the overall waste to calculate a ``best information'' amountfor slabbing waste.<T3>Comment 56:</T3> The petitioner claims that the Department should usethe actual lease expense reported on the company's financial statements,not the imputed amount which the company calculated for its submission.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> The Department agrees with the petitioner and hasincluded the amount for the lease reported on the company's financial statements.<T3>Comment 57:</T3> The petitioner argues that the costs for productionconsultants, drafting, architectural consulting, quality control inspection,and the salaries and termination pay for the production manager, projectmanager, and draftsman, should be included in the cost of manufacturing,because these costs are related to manufacturing.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department agrees with the petitioner and hasreclassified these expenses as part of the costs of manufacturing. <T3>Comment 58: </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department should notaccept the unverified sawing invoice charges as evidence that related companiescharge the same prices as unrelated companies. The Department must use``best information available'' based on the petitioner's information. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department reviewed the invoice in questionand has no basis to believe that it is not an invoice from an unrelatedparty. Therefore, the Department used this invoice to adjust Pisani's fabricationcosts in accordance with section 773(e)(2) of the Act. <T3>Comment 59: </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department should usethe highest price for Pisani's block purchases of Balmoral Red since thecompany could not identify the block used in the project under investigation.The respondent contends that it told the Department during verificationthat the lower-priced blocks were used for the project. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>Since the specific block used in the project couldnot be determined from the company's records, the average prices for purchasesof blocks of Balmoral Red were used. <T3>Comment 60: </T3>The petitioner contends that Pisani's sawing costsshould take into account the additional amounts charged by its subcontractor.Therefore, the sawing costs should be increased by the amount of the subcontractor'scharge. The respondent argues that the material costs were based on list priceand that, in addition to these charges, discounts were also received. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department agrees that the additional chargesreflected on the invoices for sawing costs should be included when determiningthe total costs for these services. The company did not provide invoicesor other evidence reflecting the discounts during verification. <T3>Comment 61: </T3>The petitioner claims that the Department should notreduce the costs of slabs for reimbursements for defective slabs becausethere is no evidence on the record which supports respondent's claim. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department did not make an adjustment for reimbursementfor defective slabs because the respondent did not provide support forthe statement. <T3>Comment 62: </T3>The petitioner states that, unless the Departmenthas verified that Pisani pays no transportation costs from the non-Italianquarry to Italy, it should attribute to Pisani's purchases of raw graniteblock the highest transportation expenses incurred by another respondentto ensure that all costs have been included in the constructed value. The respondent claims that all of its purchases are from granite tradingcompanies with offices located in the Carrara area and, therefore, transportationcost should be the same. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department could not verify the transportationcost which Pisani submitted in its questionnaire response. Therefore, asbest information available, the Department used the amount of transportationcosts reflected in Pisani's financial statements and allocated this amountto each project based on its cost of manufacturing. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 63: </T3>An interested party argues that if contracts negotiatedby importers prior to the time of the Department's preliminary determinationare not exempted from the suspension of liquidation order, material injurywill be caused these parties. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>Section 733(d)(2) of the Act, 19 U.S.C. 1673b(d)(2),requires the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security for eachentry subject to the Department's suspension of liquidation order.
