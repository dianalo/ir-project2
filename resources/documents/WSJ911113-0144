Most ofall, they assailed the political establishment itself.   With the shock waves of Democrat Harris Wofford's victoryin last week's Pennsylvania Senate race still fresh, thecandidates jockeyed for position on the outside track of theroad to the White House. The first debate of the 1992campaign season turned into a derby to determine who is thebiggest outsider.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Americans are growing distrustful of {the current}leadership,&quot; said Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. &quot;We need tochange much more than just the presidency.&quot;   There was broad agreement on the need for betterschooling, more competitive industries, comprehensivehealth-care coverage and the need for remedies to economicpolicies that are, as former Sen. Paul Tsongas ofMassachusetts put it, &quot;taking this country over the economiccliff.&quot; The phrases that turned up most often were &quot;middleclass&quot; -- the key, Democratic strategists believe, fortoppling President Bush -- and &quot;investment&quot; -- the code wordfor spending, particularly on infrastructure. Though the sixstruggled for advantage, they showed little taste for takingon each other.   Instead, the focus of antagonism was a political systemthat to some extent molded each of them. Jerry Brown, whotwice was elected governor of California and just finished aterm as chairman of the state's Democratic party, took thatto its greatest extreme, using specific policy questions toattack &quot;the incumbent leadership&quot; and to argue that power inAmerica is &quot;in the grip of a fraction of the people of thiscountry.&quot;   In various degrees the other candidates took up thattheme. &quot;The working people of America have a right to beangry,&quot; said Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia. Gov. BillClinton of Arkansas added: &quot;We've rewarded wealth and greed.&quot;   The candidates stoked the greatest interest with theircomments on the proposal for a North American free-tradeagreement that includes Mexico, a plan that the Bushadministration supports and that organized labor opposes outof the belief that the U.S. will end up exporting jobs toMexico. Even there the differences were muted.   The legislation is opposed by Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, Mr.Wilder and Mr. Brown, and the others showed little enthusiasmfor it. &quot;I don't trust them {the administration} to negotiatea good deal,&quot; said Mr. Clinton.   Organized labor sided with former Vice President WalterMondale early in the 1984 campaign season but found itself onthe defensive as an intrusive &quot;special-interest group&quot;throughout that campaign. Even so, labor support is animportant element in Democratic caucuses and primaries, andthe six candidates were eager to appeal to the 700 delegatesat the convention here, with Mr. Harkin making the mostimpassioned entreaty.   &quot;There are some who say you are the problem,&quot; he told theunion officials. &quot;I'm here to say you're part of thesolution.&quot; He twice used a potent applause line: &quot;I'm on yourside.&quot;   More than anything else, the labor debate offered anopportunity for the six contenders, all late starters in apresidential race frozen by the Gulf War and President Bush'shigh early poll ratings, to position themselves for the weeksand months of campaigning ahead.   Here's how they used the opportunity:   -- Mr. Brown. The peripatetic former governor used everychance to attack politicians, even Democrats whom he saidwere allowing special-interest groups to &quot;eat away like acancer&quot; at the party. On other issues he offered scantspecifics, even turning the health-care question into a wayto take on &quot;the medical-insurance complex.&quot;   -- Mr. Clinton. The Arkansas governor unveiled afive-point plan to jump-start the economy that includedreductions in credit-card interest rates, a middle-class taxcut and swift approval of highway funds to create more than40,000 new construction jobs. He was willing to remind thelabor leaders that many of their members had abandoned theDemocrats, and urged them to accept &quot;the challenge tochange.&quot;   -- Mr. Harkin. The Iowan emphasized the economic distressof the country but argued that the demands of the middleclass needn't be unheeded. &quot;We're not broke,&quot; he said. &quot;We'rethe richest country in the world.&quot; He supported earlychildhood education and a comprehensive health-insurance planand called on the U.S. to stop underwriting Japan and Germanyby picking up a large measure of their defense costs.   -- Mr. Kerrey. With an appeal for parental leavelegislation, an increase in the minimum wage and extendedunemployment benefits, the Nebraska senator filled out acampaign platform that last week advocated a drastic overhaulof the federal government and its bureaucracy. He spoke ofhealth care as a &quot;right&quot; and said he cast a &quot;reluctant vote&quot;to permit the president to seek the North American free tradetreaty on a fast track.   -- Mr. Tsongas. Arguing that the cold war is over and thatJapan, Germany, Taiwan and Switzerland won it, Mr. Tsongascalled on the U.S. to develop an economic plan and criticizedMr. Bush for his foreign travel.   -- Mr. Wilder. The governor used the debate as a forum toargue that the administration has rendered &quot;prejudicerespectable again&quot; and to say that the U.S. has leaders who&quot;saddled working Americans with their budget and economicmess.&quot;   In the middle of the 90-minute session, Mr. Harkin offereda colorful metaphor for GOP economics, arguing that theRepublicans, prone to trickle-down theories, applied thefertilizer to the top of the economic tree. He saidfertilizer &quot;works best when you spread it around a bit.&quot;   To which Mr. Tsongas added: &quot;That's true in politics,too.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
