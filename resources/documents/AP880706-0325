Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of commerce for exportadministration, said that Cocom last week approved the licenses,which were granted by the Commerce Department in May.   Paris-based Cocom _ the Coordinating Committee for MultilateralExport Controls _ rules on sales of sensitive technology to theCommunist bloc by the United States, Canada, the Western Europeanallies and Japan.   Freedenberg said the Boeing licenses require that sensitiveelectronic equipment, including navigation and communicationssystems in the planes' cockpits, be sealed. Servicing of theplanes' engines will be allowed only in a Western country, he said.   The licenses, good for two years, will permit Seattle-basedBoeing to sell three wide-body 767 jets to LOT, the Polish airline,and three to Tarom, the Romanian airline. The combined sales areworth between $250 million and $350 million, he said.   ``I think it's fairly significant because you're talking apotential multibillion-dollar Eastern European market. You'retalking a choice of American technology over Soviet technology andyou're talking about a growing trade relationship in commercialaerospace. That's all good news for American companies,''Freedenberg said in a telephone interview.   Last month Airbus Industrie, a Western European aircraftmanufacturing consortium, announced its first aircraft sale to anEastern bloc nation under new Cocom rules. With similarrestrictions, it is selling three A310-300 jets to Interflug, theEast German national airline.   Freedenberg said there are also applications pending fromseveral aircraft makers to sell to Malev, the Hungarian airline.</TEXT></DOC>
