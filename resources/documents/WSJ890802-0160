Johnson andamp; Son Inc., a federal court magistrate ruled.    The suit, filed in federal court here in 1983, asked the court to enjoin Gillette from selling its Foamy Gel, a competitor to Johnson's Edge product. Damages, if any, will be determined in a later hearing.    A Gillette spokeswoman said the personal care products maker won't have to remove its product from the market, because Johnson's patent expired in 1987. She said Gillette hasn't decided whether to appeal. Johnson, based in Racine, Wis., makes personal care and other consumer products and industrial and specialty chemicals. </TEXT></DOC>
