Telephone (202) 732-1938.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Supplementary information:</T2> The Indian Education formula grantprogram was amended and reauthorized by Part C of Title V of Pub. L. 100-297(Indian Education Act of 1988; the Act). The Act subsequently was amendedagain by Pub. L. 100-427.Under section 5312(b) of the Act, formula grants may be awarded to localeducational agencies, certain tribal schools, and, under certain circumstances,schools operated by the BIA. Except where noted in these final regulations,the term ``LEA'' includes tribal schools and schools operated by the BIA.On November 16, 1988 the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for this program in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 46412-46414). Except for technical revisions,there are no differences between the NPRM and these final regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, four parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and ofthe changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows.Section 251.20<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter recommended that andSection; 251.20 be amendedto state that 50 percent of the members of the parent committee must beIndian.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The proposed regulations clarified an exception tothe parent committee requirement, but did not address the requirement itself.The Department cannot issue final substantive changes to provisions thatwere not included in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and, therefore,were not made open to public comment generally. However, the Departmentappreciates the suggestion and will consider it for future rulemaking onthis provision.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Section 251.22<T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter proposed that the period during which506 forms may be obtained for students included in the Indian student countbe extended through June of the school year in which the count is taken.The commenter felt the additional time would be needed in those instancesin which State and Federal desegregation guidelines prohibit a more timelycompletion of annual student counts.Two commenters recommended that the student count period be extended beyondthe 30-day period proposed in the NPRM. One commenter proposed that thecount period start with the beginning of the school year and continue untilthe application deadline date. The second commenter proposed that the countperiod be extended to one school fiscal year and that the count be an aggregateor cumulative count to conform with school finance plans that were designedto ensure equity in the distribution of educational resources.Two commenters recommended that the former andSection; 251.22, which describedapplication content requirements, be retained because most applicants andgrantees refer to the program regulations for questions concerning applicationand project administration requirements. The commenters noted that, althoughthe requirements originally described in andSection; 251.22 initially mustbe addressed during the application process most of them must be implementedand monitored throughout the grant period. It was felt they would be moreaccessible if they were to be retained in the regulations that containall other grant requirements.The commenters said that the Department might not limit application contentrequirements to those contained in the authorizing legislation and that,therefore, potential applicants may not be able to anticipate the requirements.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Department recognizes that the student count processin very large school districts and in districts that are required to followspecial procedures under desegregation guidelines may take a long periodof time to complete. However, the Department must receive completed studentcounts by early spring so that it can calculate award amounts and issueawards in sufficient time to permit implementation of projects by the beginningof the next school year. This schedule would permit LEAs to know the amountof their grant awards so that they may engage staff and otherwise planfor projects in a timely manner.Since the Department uses all counts in determining LEA allocations nationally,some restrictions on the count period are necessary to ensure equity inthe distribution of funds. Allowing LEAs to count children at any timeduring the school year until the application submission date, or later,could result in some children being counted by more than one district.If aggregate or cumulative counts are used, some children may be countedmore than once by a district. These duplicated counts would result in misallocationsof the funds available.The former andSection; 251.22 was deleted in the NPRM, because the informationcollection requirements in that section are either statutory or based onthe regulations. The application package does not contain requirementsbeyond those in the statute and regulations. Therefore, the Secretary considersthe inclusion of that section in the regulations as duplicative and unnecessary.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Section 251.43<T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter suggested that the term ``objectives''be used in lieu of the term ``goals'' to be more consistent with the terminologyused and the level of planning undertaken by the projects funded underthe program. The commenter said that most of the projects are small andoperate under relatively short-term objectives rather than long-term goals.The commenter also questioned whether the section's requirement to amendapplications would apply to subsequent applications for the same activity.The commenter felt that unless the section refers to subsequent applications,the provision will be difficult to enforce. This observation was basedon the fact that many projects are funded with new grants annually, evaluationsfrequently are conducted at the end of the grant period, and the resultsof the evaluations are not due to the Department until after the subsequentgrant period has begun.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Department agrees that the use of the term ``objectives''would be consistent with the terminology contained in other relevant regulationsthat apply to grantees. For example, andSection;andSection; 75.111(c) and 75.590(a),respectively, of the Education Department General Administrative Regulations(EDGAR) discuss an applicant's description of project objectives and agrantee's evaluation of its progress in achieving those objectives. The provision in andSection; 251.43 is intended to apply to the grant agreement,which includes the approved application, that is in effect at the timethe evaluation information is received by the grantee. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 251.43 has been revised to use the term ``objectives''instead of the term ``goals.'' Executive Order 12291 These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order. Intergovernmental Review This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 andthe regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive Orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 251 </ITAG>Education, Elementary and secondary education, Grant programs_education,Grant programs_Indians, Indians_education, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 27, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
