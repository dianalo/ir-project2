The prosecution trotted out a 10-inch model of a fly to displayin magistrates' court on Monday, where chef Albert Roux wascontesting 15 charges of violating food and hygiene regulations andfive under health and safety legislation.   The charges, for which the eatery could face fines, refer to foodcontamination by flies and the premises being at risk of infestationby rats and mice.   Today, prosecutors dropped one charge filed under the food andhygiene regulations, saying it had been determined there was noproblem with the location of the restaurant staff's bathroom.   Le Gavroche, in London's chichi Mayfair area, is one of just tworestaurants in Britain to hold the coveted Michelin three-starrating. The other, at Bray-on-Thames, west of London, is run byRoux's brother, Michel.   A health officer for Westminster city council has testified thathe saw flies in the restaurant kitchen, attracted by dirty, opengarbage bins outside, flying in through open windows and doors andholes in the pantry's mesh screen.   Dr. Nicholas Burgess, an entomologist and witness for theprosecution, brought in the model of the fly.   He testified that the insect has ``revolting'' eating habits andcan cause a list of diseases running to 45 pages. Burgess said theseinclude salmonella, dysentery and conjunctivitis and said fliescontaminate food while they eat, mate and lay eggs on it.   There was laughter in court when Burgess added that in the Jewishreligion, ``one can kill flies on the Sabbath and a fly in one'sfood is grounds for divorce.''   But Burgess said in answering Roux's lawyer, Timothy Cassel: ``Idon't think any entomologist could find direct evidence of anyparticular disease caused by a fly.''   Cassel said council health officer Alexander Parker-Brown was``obviously biased'' and ``eager to prosecute ... One cannot relytoo heavily on the objectivity, fairness and judgement of a man whodescribed a chipped (electric) plug as `serious.'''   Cassel said Parker-Brown's predecessor had praised the LeGavroche kitchen and put it in the top category. The kitchen'salleged deterioration coincided with the arrival of Parker-Brown, hesaid.   Le Gavroche, said the attorney, is a ``restaurant of which thiscountry can feel proud.''   Cassel said it was inconceivable that in 18 months it could havegone from being a shining example to squalor and a possiblecandidate for closure, and then back to best again, ``all under thesame management.''   Health officers have said they did not find Le Gavroche filthyenough to close, but the bad publicity over the case has been amajor punishment in itself.</TEXT></DOC>
