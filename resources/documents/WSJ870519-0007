The forms released yesterday -- preliminary versions of the 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ forms together with several schedules designed to accompany them -- don't look strikingly different from their 1986 counterparts. But the IRS says they include significant changes, especially related to dependents, personal exemptions and the computation of the standard deduction.    &quot;You try to do it as unobtrusively as possible,&quot; Arthur Altman, chairman of the agency's tax forms coordinating committee, told a press briefing, &quot;but you can't get around the statute. The forms are a reflection of what Congress has given us.&quot;    To accommodate the sweeping tax overhaul, the IRS is revising 200 forms and issuing 40 new ones. Eight to 10 of the new ones will apply to individual taxpayers. The modifications range from the removal of a line for the deduction for two-earner married couples {the deduction was repealed by the new law} to the addition of extensive calculations for taxpayers who must differentiate between passive and nonpassive income {the new law sharply curtails deductions for losses from passive business activities}.    The IRS is seeking public comment on the forms, which were published in the Federal Register yesterday and have been sent to accountants, tax services and other professional groups for review. Instructions and additional forms and worksheets are scheduled to be released in June and July.    The agency cautioned that the forms are subject to change and must still be approved by the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget.    Here are some areas of major change:    Dependents -- Space has been added for taxpayers to list the full name and Social Security number of their dependents over the age of five years old. Now only the names need to be listed for children, plus the name and relationship of other dependents. This change, which will require parents to get Social Security numbers for their minor children, carries out a tax-law provision designed to stop taxpayers from claiming nonexistent dependents. Also, taxpayers must give the number of dependent children who don't live with them because of divorce or separation. This is intended to keep both divorced parents from claiming the same child as a dependent.    Children's Income -- The IRS is adding a line and a worksheet for taxpayers to calculate the tax for children under age 14 who have more than $1,000 in unearned income. Under a tax-law provision designed to prevent parents from avoiding taxes by shifting income to children, such income must be taxed at the parents' top rate.    Personal Exemption -- The new tax law eliminates the personal exemption for people who are claimed as dependents on other people's returns, and it eliminates the extra exemption for blind or elderly taxpayers. As a result, the personal exemption is no longer pre-printed on the 1040EZ form, and the IRS is adding special instructions to other forms for the elderly and blind, who get a larger standard deduction.    Also, the standard deduction no longer will be incorporated directly into the tax tables. Instead, taxpayers using the standard deduction will have to claim it on the return.    IRA -- The deduction for Individual Retirement Accounts will be listed on two lines rather than one, with the spouse's deduction listed separately. This was needed to reflect new limits on the deductibility of IRAs.    Tax-exempt Interest -- For the first time, taxpayers must list such interest on the tax return. This interest already is counted in determining whether Social Security benefits are taxable but hasn't had to be shown on the form before.    Itemized Deductions-The repeal of the sales-tax deduction allowed the IRS to remove the line for general sales taxes from Schedule A, on which itemized deductions are listed. The agency has added lines, however, to reflect changes in the deductibility of medical expenses, business expenses, moving expenses, investment interest and miscellaneous expenses.    The new returns also require a more elaborate calculation for capital gains and losses. The new calculation will ensure that the rate on capital gains is no more than 28% even if the taxpayer's marginal tax rate is higher.    The phasing out of certain provisions will make tax filing even more complicated over the next few years. For example, consumer interest, such as car loan and credit-card interest, will be 65%-deductible in 1987 and 40%-deductible in 1988.    Tax filing will be simpler for some taxpayers. Some will be able to stop itemizing and some will be removed from the tax rolls entirely under the new law. Those removed from the rolls will still have to file returns to get refunds, however.    At the briefing, the IRS said it will test the forms throughout the summer, and will be issuing publications to help explain the changes. </TEXT></DOC>
