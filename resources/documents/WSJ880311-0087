Not since the boom times a few years ago -- when oil cost $28 a barrel and billion-dollar acquisitions abounded -- has speculation about acquisitions been so intense.    The stocks of some mid-sized oil companies jumped this week simply on news of Mobil Corp.'s $1.5 billion windfall from the sale of its Montgomery Ward andamp; Co. retailing unit. Unocal Corp. stock climbed on rumors (all denied) that its crusty chairman had been asked to step down. And the nation's biggest oil company -- Exxon Corp. -- indicated it would be happy to get some attractive oil properties, or maybe even a company or two.    Believers are adamant: &quot;I think you're going to see deals; I think you're going to see a lot of them,&quot; forecasts Frederick P. Leuffer of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.    In this climate, yesterday's ugly ducklings of the oil patch are today's swans: Despite their debt loads, Unocal and Phillips Petroleum Co. top many lists of likely takeover candidates, because their stocks are trading at attractive levels, their reserves are substantial, and their potential costs, while big, would be manageable for the largest oil companies.    While no deals have surfaced, analysts note that coffers are swelling at the giant oil companies. Royal Dutch/Shell Group, for instance, has a cash horde of $9.6 billion. Exxon holds $2.5 billion. And both companies have little debt. Also noted as potential buyers are Chevron Corp., with some debt but $4 billion in cash and securities, and Atlantic Richfield Co., also somewhat debt-burdened but with about $3.5 billion in the kitty.    Now add Mobil with its new cash and Pennzoil Co., soon to receive its $3 billion Texaco Inc. settlement from the Getty Oil Co. case, and it's clear that &quot;there is no shortage of buyers,&quot; says Eugene Nowak of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Some in the industry say major oil companies will be impelled to make acquisitions before the end of the Reagan era, which has looked kindly on big mergers.    Moreover, the conventional wisdom of the 1982-1984 boom remains true: It's often cheaper to drill for oil on Wall Street.    Big oil companies have replaced barely seven-tenths of the oil pumped in recent years. Proven U.S. reserves of crude oil have fallen 20% in the past decade. The average cost of finding new reserves is about double that of buying them, although such comparisons can be misleading.    Major oil companies have been buying reserves piecemeal. Amoco Corp., for instance, bought $1.4 billion of producing properties in the last four years.    But there has been a noted reluctance in the clubby oil business for major companies to launch hostile takeover bids for their smaller brethren. Mobil's failed bid for Marathon Oil in 1982 is still remembered with hostility in the industry.    Things may be changing, however. The industry was surprised recently to see a rowdy dust-up between Arco and British Petroleum Co. over Britoil PLC, a British-based producer with valuable reserves in the North Sea.    Could more be in store? Believers hold that a new round of takeovers could be triggered by well-known corporate raiders such as T. Boone Pickens Jr. or Carl Icahn making a hostile tender offer. Or, new, more aggressive merchant bankers might start the initial run. &quot;All you need is one deal, and this group will really begin to move,&quot; enthuses Mr. Leuffer.    While a host of companies are potential targets, speculation has focused on relatively few companies. What follows is a brief look at each:   Phillips Petroleum: Smaller, more efficient and more debt-laden since Mr. Pickens made a run at it in 1984, Phillips now is at the top of many analysts' buy lists -- both as a takeover candidate and because of improving operations.    Cash has been tight and exploration has been hurt, but the company boasts big oil and gas reserves in the North Sea and the U.S. -- even after $2 billion of asset sales in recent years. But because of its debt -- now about $5.6 billion -- an acquirer would have to have a very strong balance sheet, analysts say.    Unocal: Another debt-laden survivor of a fray with Mr. Pickens, Unocal holds extensive gas reserves and a strong position in West Coast refining and marketing.    The Los Angeles-based company has whittled its debt to about $5 billion from a peak of $6.1 billion in 1985. But questions remain, among them the two-decade dominance of its 71-year-old chairman and chief executive, Fred L. Hartley, who has resisted major changes in operations.    Unocal's assets closely fit desires expressed by Robert B. Horton, vice chairman of BP's BP American Inc. unit. But Mr. Horton hasn't publicly mentioned Unocal by name.    Texaco: Even before it filed for bankruptcy-law protection, there was speculation Texaco would be carved up. Talks with Saudi Arabia about selling downstream assets merely added names to the list of interested parties, and the presence of profit-minded Carl Icahn as Texaco's largest holder has increased the odds.    Texaco management has insisted it will fight a takeover but has said it was considering asset sales. Potential combinations are numerous, among them: Texaco's California oil fields fit nicely with Shell's; Du Pont Co.'s Conoco Inc. unit and Texaco's Gulf of Mexico interests also mesh, and Canadian oil companies are looking at Texaco's operations there.    Amerada Hess: The company has prime oil properties that would be attractive to almost any other major -- particularly along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the U.K. sector of the North Sea, where it has lately discovered some new reserves. The negative: Hess's troubled refining operations and strong stock positions held by insiders. The great unknown is the company's direction after its strong-willed chairman, Leon Hess, retires.    Kerr-McGee: A potpourri of non-oil businesses -- including uranium, coal, chemicals and oil-well drilling -- in some eyes provide a built-in poison pill. But the Oklahoma City-based conglomerate has sizable North Sea exploration and production operations that industry analysts think have untapped potential. Moreover, the company's big U.S. natural gas reserves add luster.    ---                    Oil Takeover Candidates                                               AS OF 3/10                                               ----------                                                    TOTAL                     APPRAISED                     MARKET                         VALUE     STOCK            VALUE                     PER SHARE     PRICE    (in billions) Amerada Hess Corp.      38.90   $29.675          $2.50 Kerr-McGee Corp.        40.85    35.75            1.73 Phillips Petroleum Co.  35.90    15.25            3.48 Texaco Inc.             64.70    44.25           10.74 Unocal Corp.            51.40    36.675           4.28   Source: John S.
