The engineering service bureau of Westinghouse will provideprograms and computer systems for analyzing electricity, magnetism,heat and other areas in the realm called finite element analysis.   Multiflow, based in Branford, Conn., is a leader in its field ofcomputer technology and is a leader in high performance computersfor science, engineering and general applications.   ``At one time, a multi-million dollar supercomputer was the onlypractical machine for solving a large class of sophisticated finiteelement analysis problems,'' said Joe Santoro, a manager inWestinghouse's nuclear and advanced technology division.   ``Today, high-performance machines ... are bringing thiscomputing power within the reach of hundreds of engineeringorganizations. Our approach with Multiflow is to provide aneconomical hardware and software package for those organizationsthat require near-supercomputer performance at a fraction of thecost,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
