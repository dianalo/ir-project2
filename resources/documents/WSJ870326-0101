The package of legislative recommendations, along with several proposed improvements in the industry's self-regulation system, represents Wall Street's answer to the widening insider-trading scandal and the political controversy over takeover abuses.    At a news conference yesterday, SIA officials also called for tighter supervision of traders and other non-retail employees at securities firms and greater restrictions on the internal flow of market-sensitive information. They also endorsed the Reagan administration's request for a 27% increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget for next year.    The SIA recommended that each firm appoint a special compliance officer to monitor risk-arbitrage and mergers and acquisitions departments and to guard against improper information leaks. The group also urged defining insider trading to end confusion over what action is subject to criminal sanctions.    &quot;We're speaking to the issues because our industry is under attack -- for good reason,&quot; said SIA Chairman John Bachman, managing partner of Edward D. Jones andamp; Co. SEC officials and lawmakers have encouraged the SIA to become more active as Congress begins to consider legislation that would temper takeover activity and would define what constitutes insider trading, he added.    Robert Shapiro, co-chairman of Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co., said: &quot;I don't think there is any question we're going to have a piece of legislation, and it could be far-reaching.&quot;    But the SIA officials denied they were pushing a legislative package merely to head off the possibility of lawmakers adopting unpalatable measures.    The tender-offer recommendations, drafted by a special committee headed by Mr. Shapiro, would:    --Bar bidders who have acquired 5% of a company's stock from acquiring more until they report their holdings to the SEC. This would shut the so-called 10-day window, which allows bidders 10 days to file a 13D report on the acquisition of a 5% or greater stake. The proposal is designed to prevent the so-called sneak attack.    --Clarify the definition of &quot;beneficial ownership&quot; of stock and, if necessary, extend the 13D reporting rule to prevent bidders from &quot;warehousing&quot; stock with other interests to conceal their actual holdings.    --Adopt stronger sanctions for violations of the SEC's reporting rule.    --Close certain loopholes in the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, including one that exempts partnerships from reporting stockholdings of 15% or more to the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission.    --Extend the minimum offering period for tender offers to 30 calendar days from 20 business days.    --Outlaw &quot;greenmail&quot; payments, or stock buybacks at a premium above the market price to get rid of unwanted suitors, without the approval of shareholders.    --Outlaw &quot;poison-pill&quot; provisions designed to make a company prohibitively expensive to acquire, without shareholder approval.    --Require bidders to make a tender offer to all holders once they accumulate 20% of the voting stock. Such a rule would prevent the so-called creeping takeover.    The SIA also urged Congress to adopt a measure asserting federal pre-emption over the area of tender offers. The group expressed concern that state anti-takeover laws are tipping the takeover balance in favor of incumbent management and frustrating the original intent of Congress. </TEXT></DOC>
