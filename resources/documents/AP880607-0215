Kennedy was remembered as a father who guided his children withlove and understanding and as a public figure who was ``always readyto stop and reach out to others.''   Tourists mingled with friends and aides of the New York senatorMonday evening at a Mass of remembrance for Kennedy, who was shot byan assassin 20 years ago as he left a Los Angeles celebration of hisvictory in the 1968 California presidential primary.   ``I invite you to join us in renewing the commitment that was hislife, his spirit and his hope,'' said Matthew Kennedy, who was notyet 3{ years old when his father died.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Morton Thiokol, sole manufacturer of solid-fuelspace shuttle boosters blamed for the Challenger disaster, hasdropped out of the competition for a $1.2 billion contract to makeboosters for the 1990s.   The Chicago-based company announced Monday that it wants toconcentrate on redesigning the booster used on Challenger, whosefiery disintegration shortly after takeoff killed all sevenastronauts aboard.   A presidential commission blamed the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion ona plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a Thiokol-builtsolid-fuel booster, igniting the main fuel tank.   The motor redesign is almost complete, with a test firing set fornext month at Cape Canaveral, Fla., said Rocky Raab, a companyspokesman in Utah.   Thiokol's Utah plant was the sole manufacturer of shuttleboosters, and the National Aeronautics and Space Admininistrationmust look elsewhere for producers of the next-generation version,the advanced solid rocket motor.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two small savings and loans gambled on riskyinvestments in real estate and such things as windmill farms, butcollapsed from shaky lending that led to a record $1.35 billionfederal payout to depositors, officials say.

The federally sponsored National Assessment of EducationalProgress also said that nearly 27 percent of 13-year-olds arelacking in basic computational skills.   More than a quarter of the 17-year-olds reported that they didnot usually understand what was talked about in mathematics class,and only 6 percent could solve problems that took several steps orinvolved algebra or geometry.   The agency reported the results of tests it gave nearly 15,000students ages 9, 13 and 17 in 1985-86, as well as comparative datafrom math assessments in 1973, 1978 and 1982.   The report, ``The Mathematics Report Card: Are We Measuring Up,''said all three age groups improved recently, but mostly on low-levelskills, and the 17-year-olds still have not regained all the groundthey lost in the 1970s.</TEXT><HEAD>End embargoed material</HEAD><NOTE>Eds: For release 10 a.m. EDT; time set by source</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Reported incidents of violence and harassmentaimed at homosexuals rose 42 percent last year, according to a studyreleased today which blamed an AIDS backlash as contributing to theincrease.
