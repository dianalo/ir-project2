Lawyers and U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson spent theday in face-to-face questioning of a dozen prospective jurors. Ninewere deemed sufficiently impartial to be sent into a pool from whicha jury will be seated to hear the case against the mayor.   The nine include an FBI clerk, two lawyers, a government worker,a journalist, two retirees and a 70-year-old woman who said shethinks politicians are dishonest.   One woman, an art teacher at a private school, initially said shehad formed an opinion about the case after Barry's January arrest ondrug charges at a Washington hotel, an incident which forms thebasis of one of the charges.   But after prolonged questioning, she said she could presumeBarry's innocence and listen impartially to the evidence if she satas a juror.   Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, said the woman shouldn't besent into the jury pool, but the judge rejected Mundy's request.   Barry joked with reporters as he arrived on a brilliant springday, asking one whether he wanted to play tennis. Once inside thecourtroom he chatted with artists, asking them how long it takes todraw their sketches for television.   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 counts of cocainepossession, three counts of lying to a grand jury and one count ofconspiracy. The three perjury charges are felonies.   Mundy said in court that he wanted the name of Anita Bonds,Barry's campaign manager, added to the list of possible witnesses.Bonds sat next to Barry at the defense table during much of theday's proceedings.   Law enforcement and city government sources have said prosecutorswere on the verge of questioning Bonds when a grand jury indictedthe mayor on May 10. Bonds has said she had not received a subpoenato testify but was informed by police officials working on the casethat prosecutors wished to speak with her.   Also added to the list is David Rivers, the former director ofthe city's Department of Human Services and a close friend of Barry.Rivers is currently on trial in the same courthouse, accused ofsteering city contracts to friends and business associates.   Drama was slight in Tuesday's questioning of possible jurors.   Under questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts, aman who works as a chauffeur said his only arrest had been for atraffic violation.   Roberts then confronted the man with a document showing he hadbeen arrested and accused of breaking into a men's clothing store.The chauffeur said the matter had been ``thrown out'' and said hehad forgotten about the incident.   ``I never went to court,'' he added.   Others questioned included a lawyer whose firm represents one ofthe government witnesses in the case. The lawyer said she knowsnothing about the firm's representation of the anticipated witness,James McWilliams, a longtime friend of the mayor.</TEXT></DOC>
