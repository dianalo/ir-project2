A three-day strike by members of the postal union and the civil-service and transportation union, known as the OTV, ended Wednesday. About 3,000 rail workers remained on strike yesterday and the rail union plans to continue work stoppages through the weekend. The strikers seek a reduction in their 40-hour workweek, with full pay.    Contract talks are set to resume Monday between the OTV and mediators representing federal, state and local governments. The employers are sticking to their offer of a 1.3% pay increase with no change in the workweek.    But an OTV spokesman said the union expects a reduction in the workweek at least to 37 1/2 hours, which would match industry concessions to metalworkers and printers. Those unions now are pressing for a 35-hour week. </TEXT></DOC>
