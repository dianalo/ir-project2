But Alfred H. Kingon, the U.S. ambassador to the EuropeanEconomic Community, told a news conference that trade relationsbetween the United States and the 12-nation European trading blocare ``actually pretty good.''   ``We have succeeded in the last year and a half of cleaning thetable of most of the troublesome trade issues that existed some twoyears ago between the United States and the community,'' he said.   Trade between the EEC and the United States will likely exceedmore than $160 billion this year, up from $145 billion in 1987 and$131 billion in 1986, Kingon said.   Two key disputes remaining, he said, are European enforcement ofa ban on meat from animals treated with growth hormones and U.S.objections to government support for Airbus Industrie, afour-nation European consortium that competes with Boeing Co. andMcDonnell Douglas Corp.   Kingon said little progress has been made on either issue and noresolution was in sight.   The meat hormone dispute, he said, ``is perhaps the mostdifficult problem on the table.''   An EEC spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said, ``No newinitiative can be expected from the (community) on hormones. Thereis a deadlock.''   The EEC says it wants to ban imports of all hormone-treated meatfor health reasons. Late last year, it decided to delayimplementation of the ban until Jan. 1, 1989.   The United States had threatened to take retaliatory action ifthe ban was imposed. It contends the use of hormones to fattenanimals, which is a common practice among American farmers, is nota health risk.   Kingon predicted the issue would wind up in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international body that solvesdisputes between trading partners.   On the Airbus issue, Kingon said negotiations were continuing.But, he said, ``I would not want to mislead you to say we are closeto a solution because we're not.''   A key objective of U.S.-European negotiations has been to set``effective discipline'' on new infusions of capital and on theconditions under which government support may be provided to futurecivil aircraft programs.   The four governments involved in the Airbus program are Britain,France, West Germany and Spain.   The EEC is made up of Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France,Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugaland Spain.</TEXT></DOC>
