 Building distributeddatabases that span the globe is a hot industry topic.andP;  But wire is thecommon denominator of these cutting-edge applications and the simpleprinter-sharing networks.andP;  Wiring systems have evolved to a central hubapproach, which simplifies network diagnostics, control, and management.andO;Support for multiple topologies in a single system is increasingly important,as departmental networks are joined into an enterprisewide system thatencompasses computers from Macintoshes to IBM mainframes.andP;  Incorporatingmultiple physical layers, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and LocalTalk, into asingle hub also allows you to conserve on costly components such as powersupplies and affords some fault tolerance.andP;  Some wiring systems evenincorporate bridges and routers, which allow the administrator to reduce thenumber of boxes in the wiring closets.andM;Graphical management systems are also a key concern.andP;  These systems providegraphical maps of the physical network topology, as well as statisticalinformation on its health.andP;  Standards-based management is increasinglyimportant.andP;  Wiring vendors are beginning to incorporate the Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP)--the management protocol most often used on TCP/IPnetworks.andP;  Some are even implementing OSI's Common Management InterfaceProtocol (CMIP).andM;Here are nine leading wiring systems that can untangle your communicationsproblems.andM;BICC Data NetworksandM;BICC's Isolan EtherConnect System is a modular concentrator with backplaneslots for up to 10 devices, one management card, and one or two powersupplies.andP;  It supports Ethernet over UTP, thick and thin coax, and fibercabling.andM;Repeater Line Cards (RLCs) provide four or eight network interface ports andcan be installed while the system is operating.andP;  Because each RLC containsits own repeater logic, only those segments attached to an RLC are affectedif repeater logic fails.andM;RLC functions include full signal retiming, preamble regeneration, fragmentextension, MAU jabber lock-up protection, partition, and automaticreconnection.andP;  Front-panel LEDs on each RLC indicate power, packet reception,collision detection, enabled or disabled ports, maintained or lost links, andwhether ports are partitioned.andP;  Back-panel LEDs show if links are maintainedor lost and port configuration.andM;The UTP RLC module provides eight UTP ports.andP;  One port on the UTP RLC can beconfigured to connect to another UTP RLC or a UTP transceiver.andM;The coaxial/AUI RLC module features four thin Ethernet and one AUI port.andP;  Viaan external switch, users can choose either four thin Ethernet ports or threethin Ethernet ports and one AUI port.andP;  The thin Ethernet ports are notsegment termination points, so EtherConnect is not restricted to connectionat the end of a segment.andM;The fiber-optic/AUI RLC module can also be configured via an external switchto support four fiber-optic ports or three fiber-optic ports and one AUIport.andP;  Through the AUI, the RLC can connect to Ethernet segments of UTP,fiber, or thick or thin coax through a standard transceiver.andM;Local control, configuration, and testing of the network and concentrator areperformed via a management panel that mounts on the front of the enclosure.andO;It features a two-line, 24-character LCD and a four-key keypad.andP;  The userinterface is menu-driver and password-protected.andM;BICC's management card provides management, monitoring, and control at theconcentrator, RLC, and port levels.andP;  The card contains a small managementdatabase in non-volatile memory.andP;  Data include network management accesspassword and port and RLC status.andP;  The database is automatically updated ifan RLC is added or removed from the enclosure or if a port is enabled ordisabled.andP;  Bandwidth utilization and CRC errors may be monitored at the portor enclosure level.andM;Isoview Network Manager software can manage networks implemented on anystandard IEEE 802.3 media.andP;  It runs on a dedicated 80386-based computer.andO;Isoview uses the OSI's CMIP.andP;  It is designed to the IEEE 802.1 Part Bstandard for LAN carriers and Part D standard for bridge management.andM;The windows-based software polls the CMIP agent in each managed device forperformance, status, and configuration information.andP;  This information isstored along with inventory records, events, and alarms in a database at thenetwork management station.andP;  The program automatically updates thisinformation when a segment or managed device is added, removed, orreconfigured.andM;Managers can query the database using Structured Query Language (SQL)commands to view network and device configuration, analyze performance, andidentify trends.andP;  They can manually input and update data about alladdressable network devices.andM;Managers can enable or disable ports on bridges and repeaters and canreconfigure devices and network segments.andP;  Administrators can restrict accessto network segments and resources by defining access groups and by creatingaddress filters, protocol filters, and custom filters based on data packetcontents.andP;  Local management of devices can be disabled.andM;Network managers can create traffic or error thresholds that will generatealarms when exceeded.andP;  Events such as a power failure will cause the softwareto write text descriptions to the event record and to display color-codedalarms at the network manager's station.andP;  Managers can also create filtersthat restrict traffic flow between segments to improve network performance.andM;CabletronandM;Cabletron's concentrator, called the Multi Media Access Center (MMAC),supports Ethernet versions 1.0 and 2.0 and IEEE 802.3.andP;  The concentratorcomes in two sizes.andP;  MMAC-8 holds up to seven media modules; MMAC-3, up totwo.andP;  The first slot in either model must contain the Intelligent RepeaterModule (IRM).andM;The IRM is an IEEE 802.3 repeater, which retimes and regenerates each datapacket entering the MMAC segments bad ports from other ports if a problemoccurs, and automatically reconnects repaired ports.andP;  The IRM comes with orwithout network management software that lets users configure the MMACmanually or automatically, includes a set of alarms, and providespassword-protected access.andM;The rest of the MMAC slots can contain any other Media Interface Modules(MIMs).andP;  The TPT-MIM connects 12 stations over unshielded twisted pair or IBMType 1, 2, or 6 cabling.andP;  Each twisted-pair connection may run up to 150meters from the MMAC to a host device transceiver.andM;FOT-MIM provides 12 Fiber Optic Inter Repeater Link (FOIRL) compatibleattachments over 50-, 62.5-, or 100-micron core fiber cabling.andP;  Each port candrive a 3 kilometer link segment.andM;THN-MIM provides 12 connections over either thin coaxial cable or thickcoaxial cable through a balun.andP;  A thin coax segment may run 185 meters withup to 29 connections.andP;  A thick coax segment may run 500 meters with up to 99connections.andM;AUI-MIM provides eight AUI ports.andP;  Each attachment can support an externaltransceiver connection such as a FOT-1, TPT-2, or ST-500.andP;  These ports cansupport multiple backbone connections (fiber, coax, or twisted pair).andM;LANView is Cabletron's network management system that allows administratorsto control and manage the LAN.andP;  The MMAC's LEDs indicate when its ports arewell-connected to the network.andP;  The terminal version of the software can beaccessed from the IRM's console port.andP;  The PC version can be run from anyMS-DOS or Unix workstation on the Ethernet.andP;  Up to 40 MMACs can be controlledand monitored from one network workstation.andM;LANView lets the network manager define threshold values and actions thesoftware will take automatically when thresholds are reached.andP;  Alarm limitsmay be set for excessive numbers of good or error packets passing through aspecific port, board, or MMAC.andP;  The software will alert managers andautomatically turn off the port or board on which a threshold was reached,then reroute traffic automatically to another port or board.andP;  The softwarestores the time and date when an alarm limit is reached.andM;At user-defined time or event intervals, information is gathered and storedon the network, specific MIMs, and individual ports.andP;  Information includescurrent, average, and maximum number of good and error packets and the totalnumber of times an alarm limit was reached.andM;Cabletron manages at the card level, unlike SynOptics.andP;  If you don't buyCabletron cards, they you probably won't benefit from the full value ofCabletron's network management.andM;ChipcomandM;Chipcom's Online System Concentrator is a modular, fault-tolerant platformfor networks of all media types, including twisted-pair, fiber-optic, andthick and thin coaxial cable.andP;  Its TriChannel architecture allows anycombination of three independent networks (Ethernet, 4/16Mbps Token Ring, orFDDI) to operate within a single enclosure.andM;Capable of holding 17 media modules, the concentrator comes with a controllermodule, power supply, cable management tray (which keeps cables organizedbeneath the unit), and an adjustable rack-mount kit.andP;  Each media module canbe assigned to any of the three channels and can be configured andreconfigured through an onboard DIP switch or through remote networkmanagement.andM;The four-port fiber module allows connection to fiber-optic 802.3 andEthernet 2.0 networks.andP;  Point-to-point distances can reach 4.0 kilometers on62.5- and 50-micron fiber.andP;  For fault tolerance, this module containsswitchover logic between ports one and two and ports three and four.andP;  Thefiber module uses Chipcom's synchronous repeaterless design, the approachadopted in the current IEEE 10BaseF standard draft.andM;The eight-port, twisted-pair module complies with the IEEE 802.3 10BaseTdraft.andP;  A single module can support any mixture of shielded and unshieldedtwisted-pair connections.andP;  The module and its transceiver support anytwisted-pair cable specified between 80 and 150 ohms.andP;  The twisted-pairmodule features high/low squelch control for maximizing link distancs overtwisted pair.andP;  When low squelch is enabled at both sides of the twisted-pairlink, the ports will accept lower signal levels.andP;  Using low squelch insteadof high can lengthen link distances from 150 to 200 meters on UTP and from200 to 300 meters on STP, without sacrificing noise immunity.andM;An additional Ethernet Network Management Module lets network administratorsremotely control modules and ports.andP;  It provides network security, loadbalancing, and disaster recovery and prevention.andP;  Using this module, networkmanagers can reconfigure users among the concentrator's three channels on thefly.andP;

 Each has four fiber ports, four UTPports, and an AUI port for cascading hubs or connecting to existing Ethernetproducts.andP;  This hub should be used with 62.5/125-micron fiber, but itsupports other types.andP;  The fiber links can travel 1,000 meters and terminatewith ST-type connectors.andP;  The fiber hub includes a retiming repeater.andM;The supervisor module provides centralized management of ports.andP;  It has anRS-232 management port, superviisor link, traffic monitor, AUI port, initialconditions reset switch, and four status LEDs.andP;  A local or remote workstationcan access ExpressNet's out-of-band management system by connecting to thesupervisor module's RS-232 port.andP;  This port lets the management cable run upto 4,000 feet over a single twisted-pair connection.andP;  The management systemcan turn every individual port on and off.andM;A daughter board containing an 802.3 interface and expansion RAM may beattached to the supervisor module to support an in-band connection.andP;  Byadding firmware, a SNMP agent can be implemented in the concentrator.andM;David ExpressView version 1.0 management software runs under Windows 3.0 on a386-based machine containing an Ethernet board with NDIS drivers.andP;

 IBM no longer recommends that customers install Type 5fiber, but now recommends the less expensive, industry-standard62.5/125-micron multimode fiber.andM;Type 6 Data Cable is constructed of two twisted pairs of 26AWG strandedconductors with a dual foil-and-braid shield.andP;  It is for use as patch cablesand PC adapter card cables.andM;Type 8 Undercarpet Cable has two shielded, flat, parallel pairs of 26AWGsolid conductors for data communications.andP;  Although it has twice the losscharacteristics of Type 1 or Type 2 cable, Type 8 can provide highperformance with its low crosstalk and 150-ohm characteristic impedance.andP;  Itsflat, tapered jacket makes it suitable to place under carpeting.andM;Type 9 Plenum Cable resembles Type 6, but its two twisted pairs of 26AWG canbe either solid or stranded conductors.andP;  Like Type 6, it has a double overallshield for data communication, but unlike Type 6, it is intended forpermanent installation.andP;  Thinner than Type 1 and Type 2, Type 9 can be usedas a lower cost alternative to Type 1 plenum when performance and distancelimitations are not restrictive.andP;  However, thinner cable generally meanshigher attenuation over long distances.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
