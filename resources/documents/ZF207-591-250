(includes related articleon avoiding a macro virus)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Maykuth, Andy.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Rumor of a virus implanted in a spreadsheet macro and migratingfrom worksheet to worksheet is still just a rumor, but experts arepredicting its imminent appearance, or rather the appearance ofits destruction while it goes undetected by existing anti-virusprograms.andP;  To avoid a macro virus: back up data from eachspreadsheet in a non-spreadsheet format, do not download macrosfrom electronic bulletin boards, check results manually afterinitially using a macro, and always start a system from the harddisk.andP;  Security experts are urging software publishers to installdevices to protect their products and clients from potentialviruses.andP;  Lotus Development Corp, manufacturer of the Lotus 1-2-3spreadsheet program, the most common 'victim' in the rumors, hasno such plans, but it has increased security around themanufacturing process to prevent the possible discovery ofweaknesses that could be exploited.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Lotus Development Corp. (security measures).andO;Ticker:    LOTS.andO;Product:   Lotus 1-2-3 (Spreadsheet software) (defects).andO;Topic:     Computer VirusesSpreadsheetsMacrosData Security.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THE SPREADSHEET MACRO VIRUS: IS IT REAL?andM;It is the PC user's newest nightmare: a virus implanted in a spreadsheetmacro that migrates from worksheet to worksheet, undetected by existingantivirus programs.andP;  In its most evil incarnation, the virus erases itselfafter subtly altering a spreadsheet's data, leaving no clue as to what causedthe dirty work.andM;It may be only a bad dream--for now.andP;  But some computer security expertsbelieve that the dream can become a reality.andM;&quot;We really think this is a lot of smoke and mirrors,&quot; says Dan Rattner,manager of protective services at Lotus Development Corp., who is somewhatirked that the rumors of a macro virus most often have it attacking 1-2-3.andM;Even so, Lotus has taken steps to alert new customers to data-securityproblems.andP;  And because of more-powerful macro capabilities, the new releasesof 1-2-3 (2.2 and 3) may be more vulnerable than Release 2.01 to certaintypes of data-destroying viruses.andM;Accounts of the virus are something like sightings of the Loch Ness monster.andO;There are plenty of elaborately detailed stories making the rounds, butnobody confesses to encountering the beast in the real world.andP;  Then again,nobody has disproved its existence.andM;Hard to detectandM;&quot;The Lotus virus is real,&quot; insists Jon David, a Tappan, N.Y., computersecurity consultant.andP;  &quot;I can't give you names and companies that have beenhit by it.andP;  But from people in my position whom I trust, I understand thatsome companies have been hit by macro viruses.&quot;andM;The stories go something like this: The victim imports a spreadsheet templatethat contains a malicious autoexecuting macro.andP;  When the spreadsheet iscalled up, the macro unobtrusively alters data one cell at a time.andP;  Before itis discovered, the virus has not only spread to other worksheets but has alsocorrupted the user's backup files.andP;  Because it lurks in data files, the macromoves unnoticed by antivirus products that normally monitor only executableprograms.andM;&quot;How many people look at the data to see if it has been changed?&quot; asksMichael S. Riemer, executive vice president of FoundationWare Inc. andchairman of the Software Publishers Association's panel on security.andP;  &quot;Thewhole problem with this supposed virus is that it is very insidious.&quot;andM;Stories about a macro-based virus that attacks 1-2-3 were a hot topic at theComdex/Spring trade show, says Pamela Kane, the president of Panda Systems(Wilmington, Del.).andP;  &quot;People were speaking about it as though it were afact,&quot; says Kane, who devotes a chapter of her new book, V.I.R.U.S.andO;Protection (Bantam Books, 1989), to &quot;The Dreaded Lotus Computer Virus.&quot;andM;Computers andamp; Security, the International Federation of Information Processingcomputer-security journal, in its May issue was first to go public with astory about spreadsheet viruses.andP;  Dr. Harold Joseph Highland, the magazine'seditor, wrote that he had initially dismissed rumors as &quot;part of the masshysteria&quot; about viruses.andP;  But two inquiries from European securityspecialists piqued his curiosity.andP;  &quot;We had the impression that they knew morethan they said,&quot; wrote Highland.andP;  &quot;From the details given about how the virusworked, it was more than likely that one or both of these virus hunters hadencountered a live version of the virus.&quot;andM;Small data changesandM;Highland, however, was unable to put his hands on the real thing, so he didthe next best thing.andP;  He had his associates write &quot;a simple, demonstrationvirus&quot; for 1-2-3.andP;  The autoexecuting macro, which is called \0 in aworksheet, did as it was told: Each time the worksheet was loaded, itsearched a specific column in the spreadsheet and altered a number by a smallpercentage.andM;highland is not the only computer-security expert who has explored thehideous possibilities of a macro virus.andP;  Ralph Spencer Poore, senior managerof Ernst andamp; Winney (Baltimore), one of the Big Eight accounting firms, wrotean autoexecuting macro for 1-2-3 that replicated itself on otherspreadsheets.andP;  &quot;We are able to show that a macro virus is possible,&quot; he says,&quot;and not just in 1-2-3, but in a whole slew of products.&quot;andM;At a computer confab this spring, Poore mentioned his findings to some Lotusofficials.andP;  &quot;We explained to him that we were not really thrilled with hisusing 1-2-3 as a hypothetical case,&quot; says Rattner.andM;It was not the first time Lotus officials had heard about a virus designed toattack 1-2-3 spreadsheets.andP;  They deny, however, that they have ever seen sucha thing.andP;  &quot;These people swear up and down that they've seen them, but theyhaven't sent us a copy,&quot; says Peter C. Dichard, a software engineer at Lotus.andM;The security experts who have dabbled with writing the macro viruses saytheir intent was only to prove that such a creature is possible.andP;  &quot;Myresponse to that is, So what?,&quot; says Rattner.andP;  &quot;1-2-3 is a programmableproduct.andP;  You can make a macro that does good things and one that does badthings.&quot;andM;Lotus officials say that it would take very little imagination to write amacro that simply trashed every worksheet on a disk.andP;  Hence, they urge usersto make frequent backups, good advice under any circumstances.andM;But the strains of virus described by outside computer experts are moreinsidious and harder to detect than a macro that simply destroys all the datain a worksheet.andP;  Security consultant Jon David described a hypothetical virusthat &quot;takes a data file, inverts adjacent bytes every 17th record, and thengoes dormant for 10 days.&quot;andP;  It also manages to replicate itself in anotherworksheet at the same time.andP;  &quot;It's going to be a long time before you realizethere's a problem,&quot; he says, &quot;and by then, all your backups are messed up.&quot;andM;Noninfectious virusesandM;However, this and other so-called laboratory macro viruses may not reallywork in the real world.andP;  Scott Tucker, coauthor of the book Inside Lotus1-2-3 Macros (Brady Books, 1988) and Lotus's director of product design forthe PC Spreadsheet Division, notes that once a 1-2-3 Release 2.01 macroretrieves another file, it stops running.andP;  &quot;Therefore,&quot; says Tucker, &quot;a macrocan't infect other files in this manner.&quot;andM;In fact, there is no 1-2-3 macro command that modifies another worksheet fileon disk.andP;  Since the input/output commands in 1-2-3 are geared to ASCII files(WK1 files are binary), it's difficult to see how a macro virus might corruptanother worksheet file.andP;  &quot;You just don't have the control,&quot; Tucker says,&quot;that's necessary to write a macro virus that changes the data in differentworksheets.&quot;andM;Tucker says that even if such a macro were possible, it would be easy todetect.andP;  Simply combine the file into a blank worksheet and print the entirecontents.andP;  Scan the printout for the [OPEN] macro command.andP;  If it's notthere, you don't have a virus aimed at other files.andP;  If it is, it probablyworks with ASCII files.andP;  If it does something you don't understand and youdon't know its source, don't use it, he advises.andM;Tucker cautions, however, that 1-2-3 Release 3 and Release 2.2 havemore-powerful macro capabilities than Release 2.01.andP;  That includes theability for a macro to keep running after it retrieves another file.andP;  But thenew releases also make it easier to examine suspect files by permitting theuser to retrieve a file without running the autoexecuting macro.andP;  You canthen use the Range Search command to look for the [OPEN] macro command or theFile commands that you think may delete or modify your files.andM;In any case, the potential macro virus problem isn't confined to 1-2-3.andO;Security experts emphasize that any program that allows users to write theirown macros could be attacked by a virus.andP;  The most popular programs would bethe most vulnerable because users commonly exchange the templates that couldbe carriers of destructive code.andP;  Harvey Jeane, vice president of softwareproduct research at Ashton-Tate (Torrance, Calif.), says he has heard of noone using dBase code or macros to build a destructive virus.andP;  &quot;Is itpossible?andP;  Probably,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;I haven't given it a lot of thought.&quot;andM;Lotus tightens securityandM;Lotus officials say the rumors are likely being spread by some softwareproducers poised to capitalize on the fear.andP;  &quot;If you're in the antivirusbusiness, you want people to be worried about these things to sell yourproducts,&quot; says Rattner.andM;Still, Lotus is taking the rumors seriously.andP;  Rattner's principal concern isthat the tales might be misunderstood to imply that the product itself isinfected.andP;  &quot;There's a difference between a virus in a software product andone that attacks a software product,&quot; he says.andM;Rattner says that Lotus's position is that &quot;we're going to acknowledge thepotential problem and try to put it into perspective.&quot;andP;  With Release 3 thecompany, for the first time, has issued &quot;data-security hints&quot; withdocumentation.andP;  These urge users to be cautious about the sources of theirmacros.andM;Security experts, meanwhile, have urged large software publishers to installdevices to protect their products from malicious macros.andP;  Lotus has noimmediate plans for such devices, but it has tightened security around itsmanufacturing process.andP;  When asked what measures Lotus has taken, Rattnerdeclined to elaborate, saying: &quot;The last thing I want to do is challengesomeone to beat our security system.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
