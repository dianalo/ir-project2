The companies said they made the request on grounds of national security and in a letter delivered to the White House yesterday urged the president to exercise newly granted authority under the Defense Production Act. Gold Fields, based in London, owns 49.3% of New York-based Newmont Mining.    The proposed acquisition would be the largest purchase ever of U.S. assets by South African interests. The two companies contend that the acquisition would &quot;imperil U.S. access to strategic and precious metals vital to national security.&quot;    As previously reported, Minorco has bid $3.44 billion for the 70.6% of Consolidated Gold Fields it doesn't already own. Minorco, South Africa's most powerful mining conglomerate, is 60.1% owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and diamond mining interests of South Africa's influential Oppenheimer family. Consolidated is considered the largest gold-mining company outside of South Africa and has large mineral interests in the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom.    The two companies said Gold Fields produces such strategic materials as rutile and zircon and will soon produce platinum. Rutile is used in titanium metal, which has such defense applications as military aircraft. Zirconium, a product of zircon, is a critical component in U.S. nuclear submarines.    The acquisition would place a substantial portion of U.S. gold-mine reserves and the only U.S. natural rutile source in South African hands. &quot;The acquisition would further threaten U.S. national security by placing under South African control a substantial portion of Free World supplies of rutile, monazite, platinum metals, zircon and gold,&quot; the companies said.    The companies said that under the Defense Production Act, as amended by this year's trade bill, the president is empowered to investigate and suspend or halt mergers on grounds of national security. The president has 30 days from the date of such request to initiate an investigation. Gold Fields and Newmont Mining said they have urged the president to &quot;immediately enjoin&quot; the transfer of U.S. assets, pending completion of the investigation.    Last week, Rudolph Agnew, Consolidated Gold Fields chairman, said he would defend against the hostile takeover by letting the shareholders decide the issue based on the company's record and prospects, and didn't emphasize Minorco's South African ties. </TEXT></DOC>
