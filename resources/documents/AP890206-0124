The request was submitted by an Israeli diplomat to the StateDepartment's Bureau of Near East Affairs, which handles the MiddleEast, said the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity.   In Israel, Defense Minister Moshe Arens accused the PLO ofviolating its December pledge to renounce all acts of terrorism.   In a speech to the Conference of Presidents of Major AmericanJewish Organizations, Arens cited a clash Saturday in which Israelitroops killed five Palestinians on the northern border of Israel'sself-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.   The radical PLO factions of George Habash's Marxist Popular Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine and the Syrian-backed PalestinianLiberation Front took responsibility for trying to attack Israelipositions.   Last December, the United States overturned a 13-year ban ontalks with the PLO after the organization's chief, Yasser Arafat,promised to stop all acts of terrorism and declared that hisorganization recognizes Israel.   The U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau. met with PLOofficials Dec. 14 and twice more since then, the State Departmentsaid.   Department spokesman Charles Redman, said ``we're looking into''whether Saturday's attack violates Arafat's non-violence pledge.Other officials said the United States was seeking additionalinformation about the clash.   The complaint came as Israel's military chief of staff, Lt. Gen.Dan Shomron, began a visit to Washington as the guest of the DefenseDepartment. Shomron has been quoted as telling the Israeligovernment in closed-door session that the PLO has kept its promiseand refrained from attacking Israelis in south Lebanon or along theborder.   But other officials contend that while Arafat's mainstream Fatahgroup may be adhering to the non-violence pledge, other, moremilitant factions within the PLO are escaping Arafat's control.   Shomron is scheduled to meet with Pentagon officials and to tourArmy, Navy and Air Force installations.</TEXT></DOC>
