For the second year in a row, the firm with the mostindividual &quot;first team&quot; analysts -- or analysts rated tops intheir industry -- was Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc., aunit of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., with 13first-teamers. Shearson, with seven first-teamers, won theoverall top spot because it had many analysts in the second,third and &quot;runners-up&quot; positions, for a total of 51 pickedoverall.   Merrill, with 48 analysts picked, finished second overall.Tied for third was Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Donaldson.Meanwhile, scandal-wracked Salomon Brothers Inc., a unit ofSalomon Inc., retained its No. 11 spot.   The biggest gainer was Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co., jumping to No. 6 from No. 9. The biggestdecliner was CS First Boston Inc.'s First Boston Corp.,falling to No. 7 from No. 4. Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s No.5 finish was its best since 1985.   Shearson, a unit of American Express Co., has had a seriesof management and financial problems in recent years. ButShearson says its poll performance validates thereorganization last year of its research, trading, sales andinvestment banking efforts in a reconstituted Lehman Brothersdivision.   Institutional Investor said it surveyed 800 moneymanagement firms and other investors.
