(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal grand jury investigating PTLfounder Jim Bakker and several of his former aides reconvened Mondayamid speculation that indictments could be returned as early as theend of the week.   ``It's anybody's guess,'' said Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms ofHendersonville. ``All we can do right now is sit around and wait.   ``I would think they're not quite to that (indictments) butthey're not far from it,'' he said. ``They're still takingtestimony. I guess we could all be surprised. We're certainlygetting closer.''   Toms said earlier that he believes Bakker will be indicted.   ``It's a question of when,'' he said, ``and what the particularallegations will be.''   The 23-member grand jury went back to work Monday morning,hearing testimony from a number of PTL ``lifetime partners,'' peoplewho contributed money to the ministry in exchange for hotel lodgingat Heritage USA, the Christian theme park run by PTL.   Bakker, who resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after therevelation that he had a tryst with church secretary Jessica Hahnand paid her hush money, has denied any criminal wrongdoing. He hascalled the grand jury investigation ``a fishing expedition.''   Three months ago he predicted: ``I don't think I'll be indicted.I never have. If I am, I'll be shocked.''   Charles Alexander, the federal prosecutor handling the16-month-old investigation, wrote Bakker and at least two of hisformer associates last month informing them that they were targetsof the probe and inviting them to appear before the grand jury thisweek.   Bakker declined the invitation, but one of the others, RoeMessner, who was PTL's chief builder under Bakker, indicated lastweek he might testify before the grand jury.   As of late Monday, however, Messner had not shown up at thefederal courthouse in downtown Charlotte, where the special panel isconducting its investigation behind closed doors.   Toms said the timing of the indictments depends on whetherMessner agrees to testify or not.   ``My feeling is that if he does (testify) it would eat up a gooddeal of time,'' he said. ``At this point, I have not heard that heis not (going to appear).''   Toms said he has had several telephone conversations withAlexander, and his expectation that Bakker will be indicted is``just my impression based on my experience and the conversations. Ithink that's consistent with the kind of talk he's (Alexander) givenme.''   Toms speculated the indictments would be returned the week ofDec. 12, but he did not dismiss the possibility that they could comeas early as this week.   Bakker has been preaching at his new church, New Covenant Church,in Charlotte.</TEXT></DOC>
