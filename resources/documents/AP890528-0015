Rebel sources said the mujahedeen, or Islamic ``holy warriors,''began attacking communist government positions from all four sidesSaturday.   They claimed to have captured several government military postsand killed or wounded at least 70 communist troops. Rebels losseswere put at about 10 dead.   However, official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, saidgovernment forces repulsed the attack and gained new territoryaround the city. It said 55 ``enemy elements'' were killed and 46were wounded.   Both sides of the Afghan civil war often make exaggerated claimsthat contradict each other and usually cannot be verifiedindependently.   The mujahedeen, backed primarily by Pakistan and the UnitedStates, have fought unsuccessfully for Jalalabad since March 6. Thebattle began about three weeks after Soviet troops pulled the lastof their troops from Afghanistan, ending nine years of militarysupport for the Marxist government.   Afghan forces still hold the country's major cities but theguerrillas reportedly control more than 90 percent of thecountryside.   Communist troops have withstood relentless rebel rocket andartillery attacks on Jalalabad, where they still control the citycenter and the military airport to the east.   Guerrilla leaders earlier predicted that the Kabul governmentwould fall within weeks or months of the Soviet troop withdrawal.   However, President Najib has said his forces' tenacious defenseof Jalalabad proves the guerrills cannot win a military victory inAfghanistan.   He has made repeated overtures for peace talks with theinsurgents, but they have refused.   Mujahedeen leaders blame the ruling People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan for inviting the Soviet military intervention. Theydemand a complete capitulation of the Kabul government and theestablishment of an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.   Fighting since the Soviet pullout has concentrated on Jalalabad,42 miles west of the Pakistan border, and most recently Khost, agarrison town to the south.   Rebel commanders also say they are preparing an all-out assaulton Kabul.   Guerrilas during the weekend claimed to have overrun at leastthree government posts around Khost, killing 50 soldiers andcapturing four officers since Thursday. They said 18 rebels werekilled.   Radio Kabul, however, claimed Saturday night that 173 mujahedeenwere killed and 32 were wounded.   Foreign observers estimate that some 1.5 million Afghans havedied in the past 11 years of civil war. More than 5 millionAfghans, about one-third of the country's pre-war population of 15million, live as refugees in Pakistan and Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
