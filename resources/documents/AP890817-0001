Hunt andhis parents live on adjoining farms in Wilson County.   ``We just can't walk away from that,'' he said. ``You do yourduty to your family first.''   Helms defeated Hunt in 1984 by a 52-to-48 percent margin. Theyspent a combined $26 million, then a record for a Senate race. Thecampaign was marked by negative campaigning and personal slurs, butHunt said the grueling 1984 campaign was not the reason for hisdecision not to run.   Hunt, 52, is a partner in a Raleigh law firm. He served fouryears as lieutenant governor and was the first governor to servesuccessive four-year terms.   Helms, in a prepared statement, said he was relieved not to befacing Hunt again. ``Mr. Hunt has demonstrated in four electionsthat he is always a formidable opponent,'' Helms said. ``I would beless than honest if I did not acknowledge that I was glad to learnof his announcement today.''
