IBM said the new machines, which are made in Lexington, Ky., replace and expand existing lines.    IBM said it introduced an &quot;entry level&quot; machine, the Personal Wheelwriter, priced at about $600. It also introduced three &quot;display-based&quot; machines, two with 25 lines of display and another with one line. The fifth new machine is the Wheelwriter 10 Series II. The top-of-the-line machines are the Wheelwriter 30, 50 and 70 Series IIs. Also, five of the machines can be upgraded.    The modified machines, including the IBM Quietwriter 8, have been restyled to look like the rest of the new line.    IBM estimated the world-wide typewriter market at $3.5 billion to $4 billion. It declined to specify its own market share.    New features included on many of the machines are a 120,000-word version of its Spell Check software.    IBM discontinued some typewriter models, including the Wheelwriter and Quietwriter System/20 and Wheelwriter System/40. Other existing machines will be available on a limited basis.    Some of the new lines will be available immediately, IBM said, and the others will be available before late July. Prices will range from about $600 to $1,800. </TEXT></DOC>
