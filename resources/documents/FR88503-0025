The purpose of Statewide supported employment demonstration projects isto convert existing Statewide programs of rehabilitation for individualswith severe handicaps to programs that offer supported employment services.Grant funds are to be spent for the costs of program development and reorganization,staff training, and evaluation. While grant recipients must also provide,or ensure the provision of, direct services to individuals, grant fundscannot be used for this purpose. By contrast, community-based supported employment projects serve a morelocalized geographical area and must develop innovative approaches to improveand expand the delivery of supported employment services. These projectsare designed to enhance local service delivery capacity. Grant funds payfor direct services to individuals but only for a maximum period of 18months. Technical assistance projects provide assistance to State vocational rehabilitationagencies in implementing the State Supported Employment Services Programauthorized under Title VI, C of the Rehabilitation Act.Because the purposes of these three supported employment programs vary,the proposed regulations contain three different sets of selection criteriaat andSection;andSection; 380.11, 380.12, and 380.13. The proposed regulationsalso include information collection and reporting requirements that aremandated by statute. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291.

However, the regulations would not havea significant economic impact on the organizations affected because theregulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessaryFederal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirementsto ensure the proper expenditure of program funds. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 </ITAG>Sections 380.11, 380.12, 380.13, 380.20 and 380.21 contain informationcollection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sectionsto the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review.
