And, unlike old-fashioned pensions, today's increasinglypopular alternatives -- profit-sharing, 401(k), 457 and403(b) plans -- generally do make it possible to pull themoney out early under some hardship circumstances.   But taking advantage of that flexibility is usually acostly mistake. The tax consequences of early withdrawals canwipe out as much as half of the value of the money taken out.There may also be investment surrender penalties that canhack off an additional 6% or so.   Benefits consultants and accountants say that people whoare seriously considering dipping into their retirement moneyshould make sure they have exhausted the alternatives. &quot;Youshould use your retirement-plan money as a last resort,&quot; saysAndrew Zuckerman, national director of employee benefits ataccounting firm Grant Thornton.   For example, one of the first things people facingfinancial hardship should do is to stop contributing to401(k) plans and similar employer-sponsored plans that allowemployees to have money automatically withheld from theirpay. Similar plans include 403(b) plans, which are the typegenerally used by teachers and hospital workers, and 457plans, which are used by state and municipal employees.   Most employees forget to stop the withdrawals when theystart worrying about ways to conserve cash, but doing so canmake a difference of hundreds of dollars a month. A highlycompensated employee who is able to contribute the maximum of$8,475 a year to a 401(k) plan would be paying out about $700a month.   Most employer-sponsored plans allow employees to makechanges in the amount they contribute only quarterly, or oncea year. But &quot;if an employee said they needed to stop makingcontributions, the plan sponsor would probably let them dothat,&quot; says Scott Peterson, a retirementplan specialist withbenefits consulting firm Hewitt Associates in Rowayton, Conn.   It also is often possible to borrow from a retirementplan. Most profit-sharing, 401(k) and 403(b) plans allowemployees to borrow and use the money for any purpose.Borrowing certainly seems to be a popular option: About 25%of employees have loans outstanding from their 401(k) plans,according to a recent survey by Hewitt Associates.   Employees with less than $20,000 in their plans canusually borrow as much as $10,000. If their accounts arelarger, they can typically borrow the lesser of $50,000 or50% of the vested account balance. The interest rate istypically 1.3 percentage points above the prime rate, whichis currently 6.5%. The interest is paid back into theemployee's account.   Repayments begin immediately, and typically must becompleted within about three to five years. Employers usuallyset longer repayment periods -- in many cases as many as 20or 30 years -- if the money is used for a down payment on ahome.   Here's an especially important consideration for peoplethinking about changing jobs or worried about layoffs: If youdon't repay the money borrowed from your retirement plan whenyou leave your job, it's considered a withdrawal.   What's so bad about withdrawals? For one thing, you owetaxes on all the money, at your current tax rate. You alsohave to pay a 10% federal penalty on all the money withdrawnif you're under age 59 1/2. The only circumstances underwhich the 10% penalty for early withdrawals from a qualifiedplan wouldn't apply is if you use the money to payunreimbursed medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of adjustedgross income, become totally disabled, or are over age 55 andretired.   Moreover, there can be another potentially significantcost if the money being withdrawn is invested in annuities orother investments with surrender charges. Surrender chargeson annuities, for example, are typically 6% of the money inthe first year, declining over a period of years.   But if there isn't any way to borrow from your plan, andyou've already exhausted other ideas like drawing on ahome-equity loan, then a retirement-plan withdrawal may,indeed, be a last resort.   If your plan permits after-tax contributions and you havemade some over the years, this is the place to start.Employees who want to withdraw after-tax contributionsusually don't have to explain why they want the money. Andbecause they have already paid taxes on the money, they willhave to pay taxes only on the interest earned, plus pay a 10%federal tax penalty on the interest earned, when they takethe money out.   But the bulk of the money in employer-sponsored plansconsists of money contributed by employers and employees'beforetax contributions. If you are desperate -- and preparedto face the tax consequences -- that's the money you'll haveto tap.   To do so, employees under age 59 1/2 must demonstrate thata financial &quot;hardship&quot; exists. This is defined as an&quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; financial burden, such asunreimbursed medical expenses, tuition and related fees forpost-secondary school, expenses to prevent eviction orforeclosure, and expenses for the purchase of a principalresidence. Employees are required to show that the need can'tbe satisfied through other means, such as selling otherassets or taking a loan from the plan or other sources.   With 401(k), 403(b) and profit-sharing plans, gettingapproval when there's real need shouldn't be too difficult.Benefits offices have little incentive to investigate thevalidity of the employee's request. &quot;The regulations allowthe company to take your word for it,&quot; says Mr. Peterson ofHewitt Associates. While one company may require that anemployee merely sign a statement that a hardship exists,another company might ask for proof.   In 457 plans, getting permission to withdraw the money canrange from easy to virtually impossible, depending on theadministrator.   How much money can be withdrawn? Practically all of it.Only earnings since December 31, 1988, can't be withdrawn forhardship reasons. Many profit-sharing plans have additionaltwists: While many plans don't require that hardship bedemonstrated, the company may allow withdrawals only afterthe money has been in for two years, or the employee has beenat the company for five years.</TEXT></DOC>
