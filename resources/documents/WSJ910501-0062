The increase, which was formally proposed in March, willlift the annual premium to 23 cents from 19.5 cents for each$100 of domestic deposits. The higher rate will apply topremium payments for the second half of the year. Theincrease will cost 12,300 commercial banks and 500 savingsbanks $870 million annually.</LP><TEXT>   Both the increase and the $10 billion in borrowing it willsupport represent the first step in a Bush administrationplan to create a $70 billion line of credit to help thedeposit insurance fund through the current rash of bankfailures. Under this proposal, premiums could rise as high as30 cents to generate enough revenue to enable the bankingindustry to pay back the loans.   Congress, which must approve the $70 billion borrowingplan, is divided over how to proceed. Last month, Rep. HenryGonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of the House BankingCommittee, announced plans to rush through a more modest planto bolster the deposit insurance fund. But committeeRepublicans and a minority of the Democrats objected, sayingthey want broad banking legislation tied to therecapitalization plan. The administration wants the nation'sbanking laws modernized and strongly backs the broaderapproach.   The issue is becoming a political hot potato. Yesterday,House Speaker Thomas Foley met with Mr. Gonzalez and otherbanking committee Democrats to seek a compromise. If acceptedby a caucus of committee Democrats today, the compromisecould delay action on the insurance fund recapitalizationplan for about a month as the panel tries to agree on themakeup of a broader banking bill.   Also yesterday, the three leading bank regulators urged aHouse Banking subcommittee to pass broad legislation thatwould improve bank regulation, allow banks to branchnationwide and permit banks to affiliate with securities andother financial services firms. These changes would makebanks more efficient and competitive as well as improve thelong-term soundness of the banking system, Federal ReserveBoard Chairman Alan Greenspan argued.   The regulators also strongly opposed a General AccountingOffice proposal to impose a 40-cent special assessment onbanks this year to shore up the deposit fund. FDIC ChairmanWilliam Seidman said a premium increase of that size would&quot;have a very adverse effect on the banking system, on itsability to lend.&quot; The GAO recommendation has little supportin Congress. A 40-cent special assessment would generate $15billion this year, an amount almost equal to the commercialbanking industry's total profits of $16.6 billion last year.   At the House banking subcommittee hearing, which covered awide range of topics, Mr. Seidman and Comptroller of theCurrency Robert Clarke both expressed support for newstandards governing real estate lending by banks. Many banksare in trouble because they made too many bad real estateloans. The officials said the standards should be drafted byregulators, rather than set by law.   After approving the premium increase, the FDIC voted toclose a loophole that could allow savings-and-loanassociations to evade certain new regulations by becomingstate-chartered savings banks. The agency adopted an earlierproposal to prevent institutions that engage in theseso-called charter-flips from evading prohibitions againstholding high-risk, high-yield junk bonds and engaging in realestate development.</TEXT></DOC>
