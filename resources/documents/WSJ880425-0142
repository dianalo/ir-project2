The group has offered to pay $230 million, or $30.65 a share, for the Parisian stake it doesn't already own.    A leveraged buy-out is the purchase of a company by a small group of investors, financed largely by debt. Ultimately, the group's borrowings are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
