These noninvasive techniques maybe particularly useful in assessing the functional severity of coronaryartery disease in patients presenting with chest pain, and could be employedto assist in differentiating between ischemic and infarcted or scarredmyocardium. By the identification of high-risk and low-risk subsets basedon certain radionuclide and exercise test findings, coronary arteriographywith a view toward revascularization would be recommended in the formerand medical therapy in the latter. Patients with mild symptoms and alow-risk scintigraphic pattern or functional response to stress couldbe spared an invasive procedure until symptoms became progressive andrefractory to medical treatment. In this review, the value and limitationsof /sup 201/Tl scintigraphy and radionuclide angiography in the patientbeing considered for coronary bypass surgery, transluminal angioplasty,or who receives thrombolytic therapy are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
