The Agricultural Statistics Board, National AgriculturalStatistical Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture determines and announcesannually the average market prices for each type of tobacco. The penaltyrates are determined on the basis of this information.Since the determination of the 1988-1989 marketing year rates of penaltyreflect only mathematical computations which are required to be made inaccordance with a statutory formula, it has been determined that no furtherpublic rulemaking is required.Accordingly, it has been determined that the 1988-1989 marketing year ratesof penalty for kinds of tobacco subject to marketing quotas are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7</C><T4>Rate of Penalty</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[1988-1989 Marketing Year]</ITAG><H1>Kinds of tobacco </H1><H1>Cents per pound</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Flue-Cured <D>119</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Burley <D>117</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fire-Cured (Type 21) <D>99</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fire-Cured (Types 22, 23 and 24) <D>113</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dark Air-Cured (Types 35 and 36) <D>98</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Virginia Sun-Cured (Type 37) <D>77</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cigar-Filler and Binder (Types 42, 43, 44, 53, 54, and 55) <D>75</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC on June 29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Milton Hertz,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-15205 Filed 7-6-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-05-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
