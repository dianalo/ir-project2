The rule is the second in a series of three rules designed toestablish a comprehensive leasing and regulatory program for OCS mineralsother than oil, gas, and sulphur. The series of rules recognizes the specialcircumstances, issues, and requirements associated with those OCS minerals.It establishes practices and procedures for wise management of OCS resources,permitting balanced orderly leasing of minerals other than oil, gas, andsulphur while protecting the human, marine, and coastal environments; preservingand maintaining free enterprise competition; and minimizing or eliminatingconflicts between OCS mineral activities and other uses and users of theOCS pursuant to the Department of the Interior's (DOI) authority underthe Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), as amended (43 U.S.C. 1334).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> February 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> John V.

The newregulations are designed to recognize the differences between the OCS activitiesassociated with the discovery, development, and production of oil, gas,and sulphur and similar activities associated with OCS minerals other thanoil, gas, and sulphur. These regulations address issues identified by MMSas well as issues raised by representatives of industry (potential OCSmineral lessees and permittees under these regulations), other FederalAgencies, State and local governments, and the public. To accomplish thisgoal, it was felt that the regulatory regime should be designed to do thefollowing: (1) Recognize the special circumstances, issues, and requirements associatedwith the discovery, development, and production of OCS minerals other thanoil, gas, and sulphur; (2) Assure that States, and through the States local governments, thatare directly affected by OCS mineral mining activities are provided anopportunity for consultation and coordination on policy and planning decisionsrelating to the management of OCS resources; (3) Avoid or minimize conflicts between OCS mineral mining activities andother ocean users and uses; (4) Balance orderly mineral resource development with protection of thehuman, marine, and coastal environments; (5) Insure the public a fair and equitable return on the resources of theOCS;(6) Preserve and maintain free enterprise competition; (7) Encourage development of new and improved technology for OCS mineralresource development which will avoid or minimize risk of damage to thehuman, marine, and coastal environments; and (8) Establish practices and procedures for wise and efficient managementof the natural resources of the OCS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This rule establishes practices and procedures specific to the activitiesassociated with the leasing of OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur.A final rule is also being established to govern postlease operations.On April 19, 1985, MMS published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(ANPR) for regulations to govern the leasing of OCS minerals other thanoil, gas, or sulphur. Comments and recommendations received in responseto that ANPR were summarized in the Public Comments and Agency Responsesportion of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that was published onAugust 18, 1988 (53 FR 31424), to propose rules to govern leasing of mineralsother than oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS. On October 3, 1988, a Notice was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 38739) which extended the comment periodon the proposed rule from October 3, 1988, to November 2, 1988. A totalof 23 comments and recommendations were received. Five of those requestedthat the comment period be extended beyond October 3, 1988. The 18 remainingresponses to the August 18, 1988, NPR were comprised of 7 comments andrecommendations from State agencies; 1 comment from industry; 4 commentsfrom environmental organizations; 2 comments from individuals; 2 commentsfrom other Federal Agencies; 1 comment from a U.S. Senator; and 1 commentfrom a group comprised of representatives of State governments, environmentalorganizations, and industry. A review and discussion of those commentswill be found in the section entitled Public Comments and Agency Responses.The first part of the regulatory regime to govern OCS mineral mining activities(30 CFR Part 280) was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 5, 1988 (53 FR 25242), effective August4, 1988. It established practices and procedures specific to prospectingactivities associated with geological and geophysical (Gandamp;G) explorationand scientific research for OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur.The provisions of 30 CFR Part 280 are also applicable to Gandamp;G explorationand scientific research activities conducted by a lessee on unleased landsand those conducted on leased OCS lands by a person who is not the operatoror lessee. A final rule designed to govern operations under leases forsuch OCS minerals appears in another part of this <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">The DOI's Responsibilities</ITAG>This rule is an action within the statutory authority of the Secretaryof the Interior (Secretary) and is intended to promote and encourage privateenterprise in the development of an economically sound and stable domesticmaterials industry in the United States while providing an appropriatelevel of protection for the human, marine, and coastal environments.Section 8(k) of the OCSLA provides specific legal authority and responsibilityfor the leasing of minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS.This authority and responsibility exercised in conjunction with the 20other sections of the OCSLA which are applicable in whole or in part, andother laws provide the Secretary with adequate flexibility and guidelinesto establish and administer an OCS minerals leasing and mining programfor minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur.The DOI and MMS recognize the potential for adverse environmental impactsas a result of OCS mineral development activities. These potential impactswill be identified and appropriate mitigation measures determined as partof DOI's environmental review process. Under DOI's case-by-case approach,issues common to all forms of OCS mining activities associated with OCSminerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur will be covered by regulationsgoverning Gandamp;G prospecting and scientific research (30 CFR Part 280),leasing (30 CFR Part 281), and postlease operations (30 CFR Part 282).The planned lease sale for Norton Sound is an example of the way DOI carriesout its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) responsibilities. On March11, 1988, MMS published a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 8134) in association with a Request forComments and Nominations for a Lease Sale in Norton Sound. Lease sale EIS'ssuch as the one being prepared for Norton Sound will be augmented by additionalenvironmental documentation prior to the approval of postlease developmentand production operations.Using this case-by-case approach, mitigation measures can be defined withspecificity as mineral resource targets are identified and recovery methodsare defined. Commodity-specific issues will be covered by specially designedlease stipulations identified at the time the targeted OCS minerals areoffered for lease. Site-specific issues identified after the issuance ofa lease will be addressed through conditions of approval of Delineation,Testing, or Mining Plans for the conduct of postlease operations. Basedon this approach and information obtained from lessees in support of proposedoperations and as a result of MMS's Environmental Studies Program, MMSbelieves that protection of the environment is compatible with the recoveryof minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur from the OCS.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>During the period of 1954 through 1988, seven lease offerings were completedfor salt, sulphur, and phosphate minerals using the regulations promulgatedat 30 CFR Part 256 under the OCSLA. These lease offerings resulted in thereceipt of high cash bonus bids totaling more than $54 million.

Sand and gravel are being produced from Lake Erie and in Long IslandSound and New York Harbor in New York's and New Jersey's State waters.Interest has been expressed in acquiring prospecting permits for sand andgravel in Federal offshore waters. The MMS is working closely with nine coastal States through joint State/Federaltask forces and other arrangements to study the engineering, economic,and environmental aspects associated with the mining of OCS minerals otherthan oil, gas, and sulphur. These arrangements include a special workinggroup with Alaska and five task forces involving eight other coastal States:Hawaii; Oregon; Georgia; North Carolina; and Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi,and Texas. Minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur which may be discovered and producedfrom the OCS include over 80 different commodities, including a numberof strategic minerals with limited domestic availability. Although OCSmineral resource data are limited, estimated quantities of minerals associatedwith cobalt-rich manganese crusts would appreciably increase the U.S. reservebase for strategic materials such as cobalt, nickel, and manganese. Existingworld ore reserves of these minerals are adequate for the foreseeable future,but they are controlled by relatively few producer countries that couldpotentially exercise leverage over commodity prices. The OCS mineral deposits that have nearer term economic potential includeheavy mineral placers containing gold, chromium, platinum-group minerals,tin, and titanium, as well as sand and gravel for construction material.Phosphorite crusts and nodules, as well as extensive bedded deposits offthe U.S. east coast, are a potential future source of phosphate_now a majorU.S. mineral export and an essential mineral import to many world agriculturalregions. The rule establishes a broad regulatory framework; the subsequent leasestipulations will define site-, commodity-, and technology-specific requirements;and the appropriate public and environmental review of leasing proposalsand proposed postlease operations will facilitate the consultation andcoordination processes authorized under Federal law. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulation Organization </ITAG>This rule governs the leasing of minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphurin the OCS. The rule is divided into five subparts. Subpart A, General,contains requirements of a general nature such as qualifications of a lesseeand disclosure of information. Definitions applicable to the entire ruleare also contained in Subpart A. Subpart B, Leasing Procedures, establishesthe procedures which will be followed in preparing for and conducting leasesales. This subpart establishes many of the provisions which assure inputfrom States, industry, interest groups, and the public. Subpart C, FinancialConsiderations, establishes provisions for the determination and paymentof rent and royalty and the submission of bonds. Subpart D, Assignmentsand Lease Extensions, establishes provisions for the transfer of leasesand for the extension of leases in the event of a suspension of productionor other operations. Subpart E, Termination of Leases, establishes provisionsfor the relinquishment and termination of leases. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments and Agency Responses </ITAG>Provisions of the final rule are discussed below in a section-by-sectiondiscussion of the comments and recommendations received in response tothe August 18, 1988, NPR (53 FR 31424). General Comments <T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters stated that the rule was premature dueto the depressed conditions of the minerals markets and apparent lack ofindustry interest. One of the commenters suggested that any lease salesthat are to be held in the near future, such as the proposed sale off Alaska,could be accomplished through State/Federal agreements without regulationsin place. <T3>Response: </T3>The MMS does not agree that the rules are premature.Not all minerals markets are depressed and some minerals industry interestin leasing OCS minerals exists. Forty-five Gandamp;G exploration (prospecting)permits have been issued since the 1960's, with over 80 percent of thoseissued having been issued since 1982. The MMS agrees that lease sales couldbe held in the absence of these regulations. However, mining company representativeshave stated that without regulations, they cannot accurately predict theeconomics of the operation nor can they raise necessary venture capitalwithout regulatory certainty.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters asserted that the OCSLA was an inappropriateand inadequate vehicle for marine mining and recommended that DOI seeknew legislation. The reasons given for the recommendation include: (1)That the OCSLA was written for oil and gas and never intended for marinemining; (2) the OCSLA does not adequately balance national and State interestsand provides for little State involvement in the decisionmaking process;(3) the OCSLA does not provide for revenue sharing; (4) the OCSLA givesthe Secretary too much discretion in formulating a program to govern OCSmining; and (5) the requirement for a competitive upfront cash bonus bidis a disincentive. These commenters suggested that DOI desist from furtherpromulgation of rules under the OCSLA and seek new stand-alone legislation.<T3>Response:</T3> The suggestion to defer promulgation of rules in favorof new stand-alone legislation was not adopted. The OCSLA expressly extendsthe DOI's jurisdiction and responsibility to OCS minerals other than oil,gas, and sulphur. The responsible course of action is to tailor implementingregulations in the best fashion available under law to meet the requirementsof OCS mining. The OCSLA provides a clear legal basis for the promulgationof regulations to govern OCS mining. Sections 5 and 8(k) of the OCSLA,in combination with 19 other sections of the OCSLA which are applicablein whole or in part to minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur, clearlyand specifically grant authority and responsibility to the Secretary toprescribe terms and conditions appropriate to the regulation of OCS mining,including prelease prospecting, leasing, and postlease operations. Usedin conjunction with other applicable OCSLA provisions and other laws, thereis substantial and sufficient authority for ensuring appropriate balanceof national and State interests. It is true that there is no provisionfor revenue sharing with adjacent coastal States but such a provision,with a limited recent exception, is also not available for oil, gas, andsulphur. Proposals for revenue sharing have been opposed by the last severaladministrations. Recognizing that there are differences between oil andgas and other minerals, the OCSLA provides the Secretary with the necessaryflexibility for administration of a responsible OCS mining program.There is clear value in the establishment of a separate regulatory regimefor OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. While lease sales couldbe held and, in fact, have been held under existing regulations, miningcompany representatives have expressed a desire for regulations which wouldpermit them to more accurately predict the economics of projected operations.Greater regulatory certainty will facilitate the raising of necessary venturecapital.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters recommended that DOI prepare a programmaticEIS citing the need to deal with large areas and the cumulative effectsof mining. Commenters stated that the MMS Report No. 87-0035 ``Marine Miningon the OCS'' did not adequately address environmental effects. Commentersalso recommended that DOE commit to the preparation of an EIS prior toeach lease sale. Reasons cited included air quality concerns and the needto conduct an EIS when different technology is involved in a subsequentlease sale.Response: The MMS does not agree that preparation of a programmatic EISis necessary, desirable, or practical. The provisions of NEPA and the implementingregulations, together with DOI's interpretation of the situation and needwill determine when an EIS is prepared. The MMS anticipates that an EISwill be prepared prior to the first lease sale in an area, and that theobserved effects of mining activities in specific areas and the cumulativeeffects of actual mining operations will be addressed in subsequent NEPAdocuments prepared in anticipation of further lease sales. Those NEPA documentswould also consider the potential impacts of mining methods and other informationdeveloped subsequent to the most recent EIS. Thus, compliance with NEPAwould be accomplished on a case-by-case basis for subsequent lease sales.For lease sales subsequent to the first sale in an area, an EIS would beprepared when technology, mining methods, other conditions, or impactsare sufficiently different than the conditions or impacts considered foran earlier lease sale for which an EIS was prepared, or when otherwiserequired by NEPA.<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter recommended shared State/Federal managementof the program as a means of dealing with resolution of State/Federal disputeswhich may be jurisdictional issues or matters arising from the implementationof cooperative agreements.<T3>Response:</T3> The MMS anticipates that adjacent States will play anactive role in the leasing program for OCS minerals other than oil, gas,and sulphur. States are encouraged to join in, or to initiate requestsfor, the establishment of joint State/Federal coordination arrangements.Joint State/Federal task forces or other working arrangements can serveas vehicle for coordinating efforts to enforcement of safety, environmental,and conservation laws and regulations (43 U.S.C. 1334(a) and 1345(e)),or for addressing issues and concerns of the adjacent States early in theleasing process. The participants in these task forces and other workingarrangements can work toward resolution of issues of mutual concern. Itis MMS's responsibility to implement the authorities delegated to it underapplicable Federal laws and regulations. The DOI is committed to workingwith the adjacent States to resolve issues of mutual concern.<T3>Comment:</T3> Commenters recommended that MMS find a means of providingfinancial assistance for affected States so they can function as full partnersin the process.<T3>Response:</T3> The commenter was referring to the lack of provisionsin the regulations (and in the OCSLA) for revenue sharing. The MMS recognizesthe concerns of adjacent States. The MMS has attempted, through mechanismssuch as joint State/Federal task forces and information exchanges, to provideadjacent States an opportunity to cooperatively participate in planningand review of offshore mining activities. This joint approach can minimizethe cost to adjacent States associated with their review and assessmentof OCS minerals activities.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A_General</ITAG>Section 281.2 Authority.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters noted with regard to andSection; 281.2,that the OCSLA does not grant to DOI jurisdiction over those offshore areasthat are adjacent to U.S. territories and possessions.<T3>Response:</T3> The DOI agrees with the commenters that the OCSLA doesnot provide jurisdiction over those offshore areas adjacent to lands overwhich the United States exercises jurisdiction and control but which arenot States (e.g., Johnston Island). Jurisdiction over these areas is notessential to the establishment of a leasing or regulatory program and isnot relevant to the promulgation of this rule.Section 281.3 Definitions.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that in andSection; 281.3 thedefinition for lease be mineral and site specific.<T3>Response:</T3> The limitation on the rights granted by a lease withregard to the mineral covered and the location of the leasehold will bespecified in each OCS mineral lease. It is neither necessary nor appropriateto limit those rights through the definition of the term ``lease'' in theregulations. The merits of restricting the mineral rights granted by alease to a lessee are discussed further in response to comments concerningandSection; 281.9.In andSection; 281.3, the definition of ``production'' was deleted as unnecessary.Also, the definition of ``Governor'' was modified to conform to the OCSLAand the definition of ``person'' was modified to conform to the rules togovern operations associated with OCS minerals other than oil, gas andsulphur. No substantive change from the proposed rule is intended by thesechanges.There was no andSection; 281.4 in the proposed rule. To adjust for that omission,andSection;andSection; 281.5, 281.6, 281.7, 281.8, 281.9, and 281.10 in theproposed rule have been renumbered andSection;andSection; 281.4, 281.5, 281.6,281.7, 281.8, and 281.9 respectively.Section 281.4 (Proposed andSection; 281.5) Qualification of lessees.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed doubts that award of a leaseon the basis of the highest cash bonus bid, as provided for in andSection;281.5 (now andSection; 281.4), was the best alternative for the mineralsindustry and should not be required. The commenter also noted the factthat that basis is the only authorized mechanism under the OCSLA and isfurther evidence of the need for new legislation.<T3>Response:</T3> As discussed earlier, the DOI does not feel that newlegislation is essential for the establishment of a regulatory regime togovern mining on the OCS for minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur.Several industry representatives have expressed their willingness to participatein a competitive system.Section 281.8 (Proposed andSection; 281.9) Rights to minerals.<T3>Comment:</T3> It was recommended that rights specified under a lease(andSection; 281.9, now andSection; 281.8) should include the right to onlyspecific minerals and that any associated minerals should be specified.<T3>Response:</T3> This comment has not been adopted. Unless otherwisespecified in the Leasing Notice, a lease issued under Part 281 will includeall OCS minerals except oil, gas, sulphur, and pursuant to section 12(e)of the Act source materials essential to production of fissionable materials(andSection; 281.8(a)). This was done in order to minimize environmentaldamage and for the sake of efficiency. While a mining operation probablywould be designed initially to recover certain OCS minerals, the lesseeshould have the right to all minerals recovered during the mining process.After investing the effort and expense required to recover OCS minerals,the lessee should not be required to return valuable materials to the seaflooras tailings simply because the right to produce those materials is notconveyed by its lease.Several different mining operations should not be required when a singlemining operation could be undertaken which would result in the area beingdisrupted only once. One mine-through operation rather than several mine-throughoperations would minimize the potential for environmental damage. Whenone mining operation does not produce all valuable minerals, a second miningoperation or technique may be needed to recover the other minerals thatare present within the lease area.In order to be able to balance protection of the environment and mineraldevelopment, the Secretary retains the discretion to issue mineral specificleases or leases covering all minerals.Section 281.9 (Proposed andSection; 281.10) Jurisdictional controversies.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that dispute resolution optionsinvolving jurisdictional controversies under andSection; 281.10 (now andSection;281.9) should be extended to include cooperative agreements.Another commenter noted that neither the leasing nor operating rules addressedjurisdictional questions involving a mineral resource deposit that liesin an area involving both State and Federal jurisdiction.<T3>Response:</T3> Under andSection; 281.9 (proposed andSection; 281.10), theDOI construes the term ``controversy'' to mean litigation where the ``jurisdictionalcontroversy'' relates to a dispute regarding the location of the commonboundary between the OCS and State submerged lands. The Secretary may enterinto agreements with the State to resolve litigated boundary disputes.The situation where an OCS resource extends under adjacent State landsis best addressed by the unitization of the common orebody as providedfor in andSection; 281.11(d)(1) of this part. The fact that an orebody extendsunder both State and Federal lands does not in and of itself constitutea controversy.To address management of OCS mineral deposits which straddle State/Federaljurisdiction, DOI hopes to be able to develop an agreement with the adjacentState for joint management to the degree joint management is needed forthe enforcement of safety, environmental, and conversation laws and regulations(43 U.S.C. 1334(a)) and the protection of correlative rights. The agreementwould involve both the State and Federal lessees and assure coordinationand cooperation to the extent necessary to maximize efficiency, reducethe regulatory burden, and obtain an equitable return to all parties. Whena mineral deposit straddles the State/Federal boundary, the lessees typicallywill negotiate an appropriate agreement to cover mining operations on theleases and the allocation of costs and benefits to the owners of dividedinterests in the area embraced by the Federal and State leases that aremade subject to the unit agreement.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B_Leasing Procedures</ITAG>Section 281.11 Unsolicited requestfor a lease sale. (Formerly Request for a lease sale and submission ofinformation.)<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter recommended that MMS require submittal ofenvironmental information under andSection; 281.11 when a person requestsa lease sale.<T3>Response:</T3> The title of andSection; 281.11 has been modified to betterreflect the purpose of the section. The provisions of andSection; 281.11are voluntary, allowing those individuals with an interest in obtainingleases for OCS minerals to request that DOI initiate steps leading to alease sale. However, the person requesting a lease sale may not be in aposition to provide environmental information, and such a requirement shouldnot bar the person from requesting that the DOI initiate steps leadingto a lease sale. It would be in the interest of the person requesting theinitiation of steps leading to a lease sale to provide as much informationas possible. The more information that the DOI has to consider at the timeit considers a request for a lease sale, the less time will be requiredto obtain additional information that may be needed.<T3>Comment:</T3> A comment was made that the Governors of adjacent Statesshould be notified when there is a request under andSection; 281.11 for alease sale.<T3>Response:</T3> The Secretary intends to notify Governors of adjacentStates when followup action is being taken with respect to a request fora lease sale submitted under andSection; 281.11. Such notification wouldtypically occur as an early step in the decision process as to whetherto proceed with an OCS mineral lease sale. At that time, the Secretarymay invite the Governor of an adjacent State to join in, or the Governorof the adjacent State may request initiation of, a joint State/Federalcoordination arrangement. Should the Secretary decide from the offset notto initiate the steps leading to a lease sale, then there would be littleneed to advise the Governor of the adjoining State.Section 281.12 Request for OCS mineral information and interest.<T3>Comment:</T3> Commenters recommended that the Director's first stepin initiating a lease sale should be the publication of a request for informationand interest under andSection; 281.12. A commenter also recommended thatinformation should be requested on specific minerals in specific tracts.<T3>Response:</T3> It is anticipated that in most instances the Secretarywill request interest in and information on the offering of all availableOCS minerals for lease. The responses to the request should include informationrelating to the need to limit leasehold rights to specific mineral andtract. Under these regulations, the Secretary retains the discretion topublish a proposed Leasing Notice as a first step in the leasing processwhen it is determined that sufficient interest and information exist toproceed with the offering of OCS minerals for lease. An example may bethe offering of a tract adjacent to an existing lease where an orebodyextends onto unleased land or the reoffering of tracts in an area whereno new impacts need to be considered. Information concerning specific OCSminerals in a specific tract should be submitted in response to a requestfor information and interest. That information may also be submitted inresponse to a proposed Leasing Notice.Section 281.13 Joint State/Federal coordination.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters expressed the view that andSection;281.13 should require establishment of joint State/Federal task forcesor other arrangements rather than leaving that to the Secretary's discretion.These commenters also felt that the role of any such task force shouldbe clarified to ensure effective participation in the decisionmaking process.One of these commenters recommended that the rules provide that any recommendationsby a task force would be heeded by the Secretary, except when contraryto an overriding national interest.<T3>Response:</T3> The Governors of adjoining States are encouraged toparticipate fully in joint State/Federal task forces and other arrangements.The MMS, however, has no authority to require the Governor of a State toenter into one of these arrangements. Joint State/Federal task forces andsimilar working arrangements have an important role in the program. Theyare intended to provide early and continuous State involvement in the stepsin the leasing process; facilitate resolution of issues of mutual interest;provide a mechanism for planning, coordination, and consultation; and makerecommendations to the Secretary for his consideration in planning forand holding lease sales. These arrangements are expected to vary from Stateto State based on the number of concerns and needs of the adjacent Statesinvolved. Thus, the precise nature and role of a given working arrangementshould not be specified in the rule. It is anticipated that the Directorwill give great weight to the recommendation of a joint State/Federal taskforce.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters noted that the joint State/Federalcoordination arrangements in andSection; 281.13 excluded members of the public.<T3>Response:</T3> Members of the public, including representatives ofthe environmental community, are not precluded from participation in thejoint State/Federal coordination arrangements. In addition, meetings ofjoint State/Federal task forces are normally open to the public.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters recommended that andSection; 281.13of the rules be changed to require coastal zone consistency determinationfor lease sales under the provisions of the Coastal Zone Management Act(CZMA). Some commenters suggested that the case of <T3>Secretary of the Interior vs. California,</T3> 464 U.S. 312, appliedonly to oil and gas. Another commenter recommended that MMS voluntarilyrequire CZMA review and concurrence even if such review is not requiredby law.<T3>Response:</T3> The DOI believes that the CZMA does not apply to activitieson the OCS other than those originally covered by the CZMA or specificallyadded by amendment to the CZMA such as certain oil and gas related activitiesand that coastal zone consistency concurrence is not required prior toa lease sale of OCS minerals regardless of the commodity involved. Thisview is consistent with the views expressed in the October 4, 1988, memorandumopinion of the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice toAbraham D. Sofaer, Legal Adviser, Department of State. That position isconsistent with the findings in <T3>Secretary of the Interior vs. California</T3> and the position previouslytaken by DOI on this matter.Section 281.14 OCS mining area identification.<T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter recommended that environmental standardsto be used in identifying areas for leasing be added to andSection; 281.14.<T3>Response: </T3>The decision to identify areas to be considered forleasing is a preliminary one which precedes environmental analysis. Itwould be inappropriate to apply standards at this step. To clarify theprocess which will be followed for a lease sale, andSection; 281.14 was revisedto state that tracts which are to be considered in an environmental analysiswill be identified at the time of area identification.Section 281.15 Tract size.<T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters opposed specifying in andSection; 281.15that ``substantially larger'' tract sizes may be offered when the presenceof any minable orebody is unknown and additional prospecting is neededto discover and delineate OCS minerals. Commenters recommended that leasesshould not be offered until sufficient prospecting had occurred to identifythe presence of desired minerals and to provide sufficient environmentalinformation to make informed decisions. One commenter stated that fairmarket value requirements could not be met if a lease is offered withoutinformation about what minerals are present.<T3>Response: </T3>The MMS does not agree with these comments. Where sufficientinformation is available to generate interest in participating in a leasesale, MMS need not require that potential lessees make additional investmentprior to offering the area for lease. Such a requirement could serve toreduce the interest in leasing, since it would increase the financial riskto potential lessees by forcing them to make unnecessary investments inprospecting activities prior to obtaining a lease. Since information developedprior to leasing would not carry a right to lease, the requirement wouldbe a strong disincentive to potential lessee participation in the program.With respect to the concerns regarding the availability of environmentalinformation, it should be noted that there should be sufficient environmentalinformation at the time that the lease sale notice is published to makeinformed decisions. The fact that additional exploration is needed to identifya minable orebody does not mean that there is insufficient informationavailable to assure that exploration is carried out in an environmentallyresponsible manner. There will also be additional opportunities for theSecretary to review and assess potential environmental inpacts. For example,available information on environmental impacts will be assessed duringthe review of Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans. Finally, the commenton meeting fair market value requirements fails to recognize that the requirementon the Government is to obtain a fair return on the rights conveyed. Theinformation available at the time a lease is offered for sale will permitobtaining a fair return on the right conveyed since the value of the rightsconveyed is dependent on the conditions and information available at thetime of the sale.Editorial changes have also been made in the text of andSection; 281.15 toclarify the intent of the rule.Section 281.16 Proposed leasing notice.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters were concerned that under andSection;281.16 the Secretary only needs to consider Governors' comments. They recommendedthat a provision be added to give those comments greater weight. It wassuggested that OCSLA section 19 type requirements be applied. One commenteralso proposed that the joint State/Federal task force plays an active rolein developing the proposed leasing notice. Several commenters thought thatmore than 60 days are needed for Governors to submit comments.Several commenters stated that there should be an opportunity for publiccomment on the proposed leasing notice.One commenter stated that the leasing notice should specify the mineralsto be offered for lease and should include environmental stipulations.The same commenter said the rule should list criteria to be consideredin making a determination to hold the lease sale.<T3>Response: </T3>The MMS believes that joint State/Federal task forcesand other arrangements offer a substantial role for State participationin the leasing process. The joint arrangements used to date provide a meansfor early and continued State/Federal coordination and discussion of issuesof mutual interest as well as issues of special interest to adjacent States.Early establishment of these arrangements and the opportunities providedfor the Governor of an adjacent State to fully participate in the earlysteps in the leasing process should assure that few if any new issues willbe raised by the Governor of an adjacent State in response to a proposedleasing notice. The 60-day time period for response tracks the time allowedin section 19 of the OCSLA for the Governor of an adjacent State to commenton a proposed leasing notice. To clarify the role of State/Federal taskforces, andSection; 281.16(a) has been revised to explicitly state that theDirector shall consider the recommendations of any task force establishedpursuant to andSection; 281.13 to determine lease sale procedures to be prescribedand to develop a proposed leasing notice.The MMS believes that the proposed rule provides adquate opportunity forthe public to comment on the proposed leasing notice. No change in therule is needed. Prior to making a decision on the leasing notice, the Directorwill consider all available information, including comments which havebeen received from the public.The right to minerals conveyed by the lease are discussed in response tocomments of andSection; 281.8. A discussion of the environmental criteriato use for decisions appears in response to comments on andSection; 281.14.The leasing notice will contain specific lease stipulations, includingmeasures designed to mitigate potentially adverse impacts on the environment,and andSection; 281.16(a) has been rewritten to clarify this point.Section 281.17 Leasing notice.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that andSection; 281.17 shouldprovide at least a 90-day review period so that States will have the opportunityto review and respond to the leasing notice prior to the lease sale.<T3>Response: </T3>The MMS did not adopt these comments. By the time theleasing notice is published, the States will have had a number of opportunitiesto comment, including joint State/Federal coordination and consultationarrangements, responding to requests for information, and the 60-day commentperiod following publication of the proposed leasing notice. The MMS expectsthat major issues of concern to an adjoining State will have already beenaddressed by the time the leasing notice is published.The rights to minerals conveyed in the lease are discussed in responseto comments on andSection; 281.8. The environmental criteria to use in decisionmakingare discussed in response to comments on andSection; 281.14. Section 281.17already requires that the leasing notice shall specify any applicable leasestipulations. Lease stipulations would include measures required to mitigatepotentially adverse impacts on the environment.Section 281.18 Bidding system.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters recommended that cash bonus bidding underandSection; 281.18 should not be mandated. One commenter proposed that theminimum bid for a tract be specified in the regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>The use of competitive, cash bonus bidding is a statutoryrequirement of OCSLA. Minimum bids may be specified in the proposed leasingnotice and the leasing notice. When minimum bids are specified, they willbe based on the specific commodities offered for lease in the sale areaand the conditions at the time of the sale. Since no single minimum bidwould be appropriate for all cases, the minimum bid for a tract cannotbe specified in the rule.The final rule gives the Secretary the option to use deferred cash bonusbidding when specified in the leasing notice. When the deferred bonus optionis specified, the high bidder will be determined based upon the net presentvalue of each total bid. An appropriate discount rate will be specifiedin the leasing notice. High bidderes who use the deferred bonus optionmust pay at lease 20 percent of the cash bonus prior to lease issuance.At least a total of 60 percent must be paid on or before the 5th anniversaryof the lease, and payment of the remaining cash bonus must be paid on orbefore the 10th anniversary of the lease. The lessee may pay the bonusinstallments earlier than specified in the leasing notice. When a portionof the cash bonus bid is deferred, a separate bond that guarantees paymentof the deferred portion of the bonus must be submitted prior to issuanceof the lease. Upon payment of the full amount of the cash bonus bid, thebond guaranteeing payment will be released. This approach to the deferralof the payment of a portion of the high cash bonus bid results in all biddersbeing on an equal footing. Each bidder will have determined that amountof its bid, recognizing that other bids on the tract will be adjusted torecognize the time value of the portion of the bid which can be deferred.For lease sales using oral bids, the Secretary reserves the right to rejectall bids received, but it is anticipated that the high bid will normallybe accepted subject only to antitrust review by the Attorney General. Infrontier areas, where little is known about the resources, MMS believesthat factors such as unproven technology, uncertain commercial value, highrisk, and high cost to evaluate the lease will all affect the bids received.The bids of willing persons in those situations is a better indicationof value of the resources than an independent, and very speculative, assessmentof the value of the minerals on the lease. In other cases, where the valueof minerals can be estimated with greater confidence, MMS may wish to determinewhether the high bid represents a fair return for the rights conveyed.In addition, should for example, a single potential bidder attend a sale,the Secretary might wish to review the high bid to assure a fair returnto the public.Section 281.20 Submission of bids.A new andSection; 281.20, Submission of bids, was added to provide interestedparties with necessary information concerning the submission of bids (oraland sealed). Proposed andSection;andSection;281.20, 281.21, and 281.22 wererenumbered as andSection;andSection; 281.21, 281.22, and 281.23 respectively.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart C_Financial Considerations</ITAG>Section 281.26 Payments.Section 281.26(e) was revised by substituting ``person'' for ``party''and andSection; 281.26(f) (now andSection; 281.26(i)) was revised to reflectrevisions in the MMS's Royalty Management Program's regulations governingroyalty payments. Section 281.26(f) of the proposed rule referenced certainprovisions in the regulations governing product value and royalty computation.The substance of three of these provisions has been incorporated in thefinal rule as andSection;andSection; 281.26 (f), (g), and (h). Section 281.26(i)(proposed andSection; 281.26(f)) continues to reference appropriate provisionsof the Royalty Management regulations. No substantive change was intendedby these changes.Section 281.28 Royalty.It is anticipated that the royalty prescribed in leasing notices announcingtracts to be offered for lease will be comparable to the royalty prescribedin onshore leases which convey rights to similar mineral deposits. Wherethe royalty is based upon a percentage of the value or amount of the producedmineral, it will likely fall within the range of 2 to 5 percent.Section 281.28(b) provides for a royalty free period as did the proposedrule. It was revised to specify that, when prescribed in the leasing noticeand subsequently issued lease, the royalty will be reduced on OCS mineralsproduced from a leasehold for up to 5 consecutive years, as specified bythe lessee, during the first 15 years in the life of the lease. No royaltywill be due on production during any year of the specified 5-year periodthat occurs in the first 10 years of the lease, and one-half of the royaltyotherwise due will be due on production during any year of the 5-year periodthat occurs in the 11th through the 15th year in the life of the lease.For example, consider a lease with a royalty rate of 4 percent specifiedin the lease. If the lessee chooses to initiate the 5-year period of royaltyreduction starting with the 8th lease year, there would be no royalty dueon production during years 8, 9, and 10; and a royalty of 2 percent wouldbe due on production during years 11 and 12. If the lessee chooses to initiatethe period of royalty reduction at the beginning of the 13th lease yearfor this example, a royalty of 2 percent would be due on production duringyears 13, 14, and 15; and the full royalty of 4 percent would be due onproduction thereafter. This provision is designed to encourage early developmentof production on a lease.Section 281.30 Minimum royalty.Section 281.30 was modified to clarify when minimum royalty will applyand when it is to be paid.Section 281.33 Bonds and bonding requirements.This section was revised to include a provision governing the submissionof bonds in cases where payment of part of the cash bonus bid is deferredand to provide additional information concerning the submission of bonds.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart D_Assignments and Lease Extensions</ITAG>Section 281.41 Requirementsfor filing for transfers was revised to add provisions concerning transferof leases.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart E_Termination of Leases</ITAG>Section 281.47 Cancellation ofLeases.<T3>Comment: </T3>A comment was made that andSection; 281.47 of the regulationsallows too long a time period under suspension (5 years) before cancellation.<T3>Response: </T3>The length of time for holding a lease under suspensionbefore cancellation is a statutory provision of section 5(a)(2)(B) of theOCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(2)(B)) which is applicable under the circumstancesspecified in the OCSLA. A lessee may request lease cancellation before5 years have elapsed.<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter was concerned about how long a lease wouldremain in effect under andSection; 281.43 while it remained under suspension.Concern was expressed that there is no provision for compensation for mineralsleft in place in order to protect sensitive environmental or archeologicalvalues absent cancellation of the Lease. <T3>Response:</T3> It is conceivable that a lease could remain under asuspension for longer than 5 years where circumstances warrant the continuanceof an approved suspension beyond the original period of time specifiedin the approval of a lessee's request for a suspension of operations orproduction. The procedures for leases compensation for lost access to OCSminerals due to development and production restriction on a lease trackthe procedures contained in the OCSLA. Since leases issued under the regulationsin this Part are subject to the OCSLA and the regulations in Part 282,they are subject to compensation limits contained in the OCSLA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authors</ITAG>LeRon E.

Ziehl of the Bureau of Land Management; and John Padan ofthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The DOI has determined that this action does not constitute a major Federalaction affecting the quality of the human environment; therefore, an EISis not required. The DOI has also determined that the document is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291 because the annual economic effect is less than $100million. The overall effect is expected to be approximately $2.2 millionper year. The cost estimate is based on an expectation of two sales peryear. The DOI certifies that the final rule does not represent a governmentalaction capable of interference with constitutionally protected propertyrights. Thus, a Taking Implication Assessment need not be prepared pursuantto Executive Order 12630, ``Government Action and Interference with ConstitutionallyProtected Property Rights.'' The DOI also certifies that the rule will not have a significant effecton a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) as the entities that engage in OCS minerals related activitiesare not considered small due to the technical complexity and financialresources needed to conduct those OCS activities.
