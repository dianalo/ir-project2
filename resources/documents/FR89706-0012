Those regulations provide guidanceon the tax treatment of taxable and nontaxable fringe benefits and generalrules for the valuation of taxable fringe benefits. The regulations alsoprovide special rules for valuing employer-provided vehicles, flights onemployer-provided aircraft, employer-provided free or discounted flightson commercial airlines, and meals at employer-operated eating facilities.The text of those temporary regulations also served as the comment documentfor a notice of proposed rulemaking (``the proposed regulations'') publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for the same day (50 FR 52333).Many comments were received from the public on the proposed regulations.In addition, on April 29, 1986, the Internal Revenue Service held a publichearing concerning the regulations. In response to the comments receivedand the statements made at the public hearing, the proposed regulationshave been adopted as revised by this Treasury decision.The final regulations contained in this document apply as of January l,1989. The final regulations under section 61 are contained in andSection;1.61-21. The final regulations under section 132 are contained in andSection;1.132-0 through andSection; 1.132-8; andSection; 1.132-0 contains an outlineof the section 132 regulations. For benefits received in 1985, 1986, 1987and 1988, the temporary regulations published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for December 23, 1985, apply. Those regulationsare contained in andSection; 1.61-2T and andSection; 1.132-1T through andSection;1.132-8T.Certain provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1985 (COBRA) and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 apply to benefits receivedafter 1984. Even though these provisions are reflected in the final regulationsand not in the temporary regulations, the provisions are effective as ofJanuary 1, 1985. For these rules, see the following discussion concerningno-additional-cost services.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>Cost of Group-Term Life Insurance on the Life of an Individual Other Thanan EmployeeThe final regulations clarify that the cost of group-term life insuranceon the life of an individual other than an employee (such as the spouseof an employee), even if an incidental cost, is to be included in the employee'sgross income.Provider of a Fringe BenefitThe final regulations make clear that a fringe benefit provided to an employeeby someone other than the employer (such as a client or customer of theemployer) must be included in the employee's income, unless otherwise excluded.Election To Use Special Valuation RulesMany comments were received on the requirement that employers notify employeesof their intent to use a special valuation rule. Commentators questionedthe purpose of the notification requirement. Commentators also suggestedthat the regulations provide guidance on the manner of providing the noticeto employees and the information that must be contained in the notice.The purpose of the notification requirement is to advise employees of thesubstantiation requirements that apply when certain special valuation rulesare used. For example, if an employer intends to use the automobile leasevaluation rule or the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule, adequate recordsthat substantiate the employee's business use of the vehicle must be maintained(see section 274(d) and the regulations thereunder). On the other hand,if the commuting valuation rule is used, the employee need only keep trackof the number of one-way commutes in the vehicle. When the commuting valuationrule is used, the section 274(d) substantiation requirement is satisfiedby the employer's written policy statement and records that indicate thatthe conditions of the commuting valuation rule are satisfied. The final regulations provide that employers must notify employees of (1)the special valuation rule or rules that they intend to use, (2) the applicablesubstantiation requirements, and (3) the effect of failing to comply withthe substantiation requirements. The final regulations also provide thatthe notice must be provided in a manner reasonably expected to come tothe attention of all affected employees. For example, the notice may beprovided in a mailing or with the employees' paychecks. The final regulations also provide that employers need not notify employeesof their intention to continue using a particular valuation rule in a subsequentcalendar year. Therefore, if an employer notified an employee that theautomobile lease valuation rule would be used for 1989 the employer neednot provide additional notification that the same rule will be used for1990. Commentators questioned the effect of an employer's failure to satisfythe notification requirement with respect to a particular employee. Thefinal regulations provide that an employer may use a special valuationrule for a year even though the employer did not provide the requisitenotice for that year only if the employer receives a statement from theaffected employee indicating that the employee knows (1) that the employerintends to use a particular valuation rule for that year, (2) the applicablesubstantiation requirements, and (3) the effect of a failure to complywith such requirements. The employee statement must be received by January31 of the year following the year for which the notice was not provided.Automobile Lease Valuation Rule Commentators requested that the final regulations provide guidance on determiningthe fair market value of automobiles that are leased by an employer. Inresponse to the comments, the final regulations provide that employerswho lease automobiles may treat the manufacturer's suggested retail priceof an automobile less eight percent as the fair market value of the automobilefor purposes of calculating the Annual Lease Value of a leased automobile.It should also be noted that the determination of the fair market valueof an automobile that is purchased by an employer has been revised in thefinal regulations, so that sales tax and title fees attributable to thepurchase of an automobile are part of the purchase price of the automobile.The proposed regulations provide that the value of an automobile availableto an employee for less than 30 consecutive days is the Daily Lease Value.The Daily Lease Value is four hundred percent of a pro-rated Annual LeaseValue. With respect to three situations, commentators complained that theDaily Lease Value is not the appropriate measure of value. The first situation occurs when an automobile is provided to an employeefor a continuous period of more than 30 days, but the period of availabilitystraddles two calendar years. The final regulations permit use of a pro-ratedAnnual Lease Value in this case. The second situation occurs with respect to the provision of demonstrationautomobiles to employees of automobile dealerships. Commentators statedthat employees of automobile dealerships are provided automobiles on acontinuous basis, but that because the automobiles are included in thedealership's inventory and thus are subject to sale, a particular automobilemay not be available to an employee for at least 30 consecutive days. Becausethe employees have demonstration automobiles available on a continuousbasis for periods in excess of 30 days, the Annual Lease Value or a pro-ratedAnnual Lease Value more appropriately reflects the value of the benefitprovided to the employees. The final regulations permit this treatmentand provide that such values are generally determined by reference to theaverage of the fair market values of the automobiles available to the employees.The third situation involves fleet automobiles. Commentators stated thatemployees who have fleet automobiles continuously available for 30 or moredays may not have the use of the same automobile for at least 30 consecutivedays. The final regulations provide that if an employer is using the fleet-averagevaluation rule and makes fleet automobiles available to an employee fora period of at least 30 consecutive days, the employer may treat the employeeas having one of the fleet automobiles available to him for the entireperiod. In this case, the automobile deemed available is treated as havinga fair market value equal to the fleet-average value.The proposed regulations provided that the value of fuel provided in kindmay be valued at 5.5 cents per mile and that the cost of fuel reimbursementsor charges to the employer must be determined by reference to the actualamount of reimbursement or charge. Many commentators objected stating thatit is difficult to determine the amount reimbursed or charged when fuelis provided for many automobiles. They stated that the fuel valuation ruleshould be the same whether or not the fuel is provided in kind.For administrative convenience, the final regulations provide that an employerusing the fleet-average valuation rule may value fuel provided to employees(whether or not provided in kind) at 5.5 cents per mile if it would imposeunreasonable administrative burdens on the employer to determine the actualamount reimbursed or charged. Valuation of Chauffeur Services Commentators also requested that the regulations provide guidance on thevaluation of chauffeur services. The final regulations provide that theservices of a chauffeur may be valued by reference to either: (1) The fairmarket value of such services as determined in an arm's length transaction;or (2) the compensation of the chauffeur. For this purpose, the chauffeur'scompensation includes compensation as defined in section 414 (q) (7) aswell as the fair market value of nontaxable lodging (if any) provided tothe chauffeur by the employer. Under either method, the amount of timethat a chauffeur is on-call to perform driving services for the employeris included in the value of such services. If a chauffeur drives an employeefor both business and personal purposes, the value of the chauffeur's servicesthat is includible in the employee's income is based on the amount of timethe chauffeur spends driving or is on-call to drive the employee for personalpurposes. The final regulations elaborate upon these rules and provideexamples of the computations. An employee may exclude from gross income, as a working condition fringebenefit, the excess of the value of the chauffeur services over the valueof the chauffeur services for personal purposes as determined under andSection;1.61-21(b)(5). Moreover, if an employer provides an employee with a bodyguard/chauffeurfor a bona fide business-oriented security concern, and but for such bonafide business-oriented security concern, the employee would not have beenprovided such a bodyguard/chauffeur, the entire value of the services ofthe bodyguard/chauffeur is excludable from gross income as a working conditionfringe. A bodyguard/chauffeur must be trained in evasive driving techniques.Vehicle Cents-per-Mile Valuation Rule Many commentators were pleased that the proposed regulations provided avehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule. Commentators stated, however, thatthe rule is not available to value the personal use of vehicles valuedat greater than the threshold amount (e.g., $12,800 for 1988). Becauseapplication of the cents-per-mile rule to the personal use of vehiclesvalued at greater than the threshold amount results in undervaluation ofthe benefit provided, the final regulations retain the restriction containedin the proposed regulations. The threshold amount is determined by reference to the total recovery deductionsavailable with respect to a vehicle placed in service in the current year.The final regulations provide, that the threshold amount for vehicles placedin service before 1989 remains no more than $12,800. With respect to vehiclesplaced in service in or after 1989, the threshold amount is $12,800 asadjusted for the automobile price inflation adjustment. Commentators requested that the regulations provide guidance on the requirementthat the vehicle be regularly used in the employer's business. In response,the final regulations provide two safe harbor rules. A vehicle is consideredregularly used in an employer's business if the vehicle is generally usedeach workday to transport at least three employees in an employer-sponsoredcommuting vehicle pool. A vehicle is also considered regularly used inan employer's business if at least 50 percent of the miles placed on thevehicle during the year are for the employer's business. The requirementsfor the use of the vehicle cents-per-mile rule are relaxed in the finalregulations by deleting the requirement that the vehicle must be drivenby each employee who wants to take advantage of the rule at the rate of10,000 miles per year. Therefore, as long as the vehicle is driven 10,000miles during a year and meets the other requirements of the vehicle cents-per-milerule, each employee who makes use of that vehicle may take advantage ofthe vehicle cents-per-mile rule. Co-Owner or Co-Lessee To determine the fair market value of an automobile for purposes of applyingthe annual lease valuation rule or the dollar limitation required by thevehicle cents-per-mile rule, the final regulations provide special rulesfor calculating such amounts when a vehicle is owned or leased by bothan employer and an employee. Generally, if the employee receives an ownership interest in the vehicle,the fair market value of the vehicle for purposes of determining the AnnualLease Value, or for applying the vehicle cents-per-mile dollar limitationis computed by deducting the amount of the employee's contribution. Ifthe interest acquired by the employee in the vehicle is not proportionateto the employee's contribution, the reduction in fair market value is decreased.Similar rules apply in the situation of an employee contribution to a lease.If the employee does not receive an ownership interest in the employer-providedvehicle, then the fair market value is determined without regard to anyamount contributed by the employee. However, the amounts contributed bythe employee will then reduce the amount includible in the employee's incomefor the personal use of the vehicle. An example illustrates the applicationof this rule. Commuting Valuation Rule In General The commuting valuation rule is available to value the commuting-only useof employer-provided vehicles. The rule is not available if an employeeis allowed to make more than de minimis use of the vehicle for any personalpurpose other than commuting or if the employee in fact makes more thande minimis use of the vehicle for other personal purposes. The proposedregulations also provided that the rule is not available if the employeeis a control employee. The final regulations retain the control employeerestriction provided in the proposed regulations. The restriction was retainedbecause there was concern that employees who are able to control the useor assignment of employer-provided vehicles might not impose these usagerestrictions on themselves. There is also concern that control employeesare provided the commuting use of more expensive vehicles than are providedto non- control employees. The commuting valuation rule applies only if the employer requires theemployee to use the vehicle in the employer's business and provides thevehicle to employees for a bona fide noncompensatory business reason ofthe employer. Commentators stated that the commuting valuation rule shouldbe available when the vehicle is provided for use in an employer-sponsoredcommuting vehicle pool but does not meet these two requirements. The finalregulations provide that a vehicle generally used each workday to transportat least three employees to and from work in an employer-sponsored commutingpool is deemed to meet the business use and business reason requirements.Shared Vehicle Usage Although the proposed regulations set forth a number of special valuationrules for the use of a vehicle, those regulations did not address the situationof shared vehicle usage by more than one employee at the same time. Thefinal regulations provide that if an employer provides a vehicle to employeesfor use by more than one employee at the same time, the employer may useany of the special valuation rules that would otherwise be applicable tovalue the use of that vehicle. However, the employer must apply the samerule with respect to all such employees and must allocate the value ofthe use of the vehicle among the employees who share the use of the vehiclebased upon the relevant facts and circumstances.Control Employee Definition The preamble to the proposed regulations requested comments from the publicon the definition of a control employee of a government employer. Commentatorsrequested that the Service and Treasury clarify the definition of an executiveofficer of a state or local government. In response, the final regulationsreplace both the executive officer test and the appointment and confirmationtest of the proposed regulations with a single compensation test. Thus,under the final regulations, a control employee of a government employeris either an elected official or an employee whose compensation equalsor exceeds the compensation paid to a Federal Government employee holdinga position at Executive Level V, determined under chapter 11 of title 2,United States Code, as adjusted by section 5318 of title 5, United StatesCode. Since the temporary regulations were issued, some commentators have expressedconcern that the nongovernment control employee definition provided inthe proposed regulations may inappropriately treat certain employees ascontrol employees. For example, employees who are named officers of nongovernmentemployers but who do not have the authority to control the use or availabilityof employer-provided vehicles should not be treated as control employees.In response, the final regulations amend the definition of a control employeeof a nongovernment employer to provide that an officer of an employer isa control employee only if the officer's compensation equals or exceeds$50,000, as indexed (for 1988 the compensation level rose to $52,235).It is also apparent that many employees of nongovernment employers havethe ability to control the use or availability of employer-provided vehiclesbut are not officers or owners of the employer. Because these employeesshould be treated as control employees but were not under the definitionin the proposed regulations, the final regulations provide that an employeewhose compensation equals or exceeds $100,000 is a control employee, whetheror not the employee is also an officer or owner of the employer. To provide uniformity within the fringe benefits rules, the final regulationspermit an employer to treat all employees who are ``highly compensated''employees under the nondiscrimination rules of section 132 as control employeesin lieu of applying the commuting rule control employee definition. Underthis option, all employees who are ``highly compensated'' employees areconsidered ``control employees'' for purposes of the commuting valuationrule, and employees who are not ``highly compensated'' are not considered``control employees'' regardless of their positions. Noncommercial Aircraft Flight Valuation Rule Flight on an Employer-ProvidedAircraft The proposed regulations provided a single general valuation rule to determinethe fair market value of a personal flight on an employer-provided aircraft.The final regulations provide further guidance on the appropriate determinationand distinguish between a piloted aircraft and an aircraft furnished withouta pilot. The value of a flight on a piloted employer-provided aircraft solely forpersonal purposes is equal to the amount that an individual would haveto pay in an arm's-length transaction to charter the same or a comparablepiloted aircraft for that period for the same or a comparable flight. Thevalue of a flight on an employer-provided aircraft that is furnished withouta pilot solely for personal purposes is the amount that an individual wouldhave to pay in an arm's-length transaction to lease the same or comparableaircraft on the same or comparable terms for the same period in the geographicarea in which the aircraft is used. If the flight is for both business and personal purposes, then the portionattributable to personal purposes will be included in the employee's income.Moreover, a flight by any employee which is solely for business purposesmay be excludable from income pursuant to section 132(d) and andSection;1.132-5. Control Employee Definition Under the proposed regulations, the safe harbor value of a flight on anemployer-provided aircraft depends on whether the employee is a controlemployee. Those regulations define a control employee as any officer ofthe employer, limited to the lesser of one percent of all employees ofthe employer, or ten employees. If an employer is part of a controlledgroup of corporations or is otherwise required to be aggregated with otheremployers under certain aggregation rules, the proposed regulations providethat the officer test must be applied with respect to each separate employer,rather than with respect to the employer group. Commentators objected stating that the officer test should be applied withrespect to the employer group, rather than to each separate employer. Underthis approach, an employee would be a control employee only if the employeewere an officer of the controlled group of entities. Because employeesare generally officers of separate entities of a controlled group of corporations,rather than officers of the group, the final regulations retain the ruleof the proposed regulations. However, an officer of one entity of a controlledgroup of entities shall not be treated as an officer of any of the otherentities of the controlled group.A similar limitation rule is provided with respect to the highly-paid controlemployee test. The final regulations define a control employee as an employeewithin the top one-percent most highly-paid employees, limited to a maximumof 50 employees. The final regulations also provide guidance as to the circumstances underwhich a control employee who is no longer employed by the employer willcontinue to be treated as a control employee. The former employee ruledoes not affect the number of employees who may be treated as control employeesunder the officer and compensation limits of the control employee definitionused for the aircraft valuation rule. Seating Capacity Rule The proposed regulations provided a special seating capacity rule underwhich the value of a flight on an employer-provided aircraft may in somesituations be deemed to be zero. The special rule is based on the regularpassenger seating capacity of the aircraft. Commentators requested that the regulations provide additional guidanceon determining the regular passenger seating capacity of an aircraft. Inresponse, the final regulations provide that the regular passenger seatingcapacity of an aircraft does not include seats that cannot legally be usedduring takeoff and have not at any time been used during takeoff. Jumpseatsand removable seats used solely for purposes of flight crew training areincluded in the regular passenger seating capacity if the seats can legallybe used or have ever been used during takeoff for other than flight crewtraining. The final regulations also provide that the regular passengerseating capacity of an aircraft reflects any permanent reduction in thenumber of seats on the aircraft. However, if at any time within 24 monthsafter such reduction, any seats are added back to the aircraft, the totalpassenger seating capacity prior to the reduction will be counted for purposesof this rule. Under the seating capacity rule of the proposed regulations, if at least50 percent of the regular passenger seating capacity of an aircraft isoccupied by individuals whose flights are primarily for the employer'sbusiness, the value of a flight on the aircraft by an employee, his spouse,or dependent child is deemed to be zero. When determining whether the seatingcapacity rule is satisfied, the proposed regulations provide that the 50-percenttest must be satisfied when the individual whose flight is being valuedboards the aircraft and when the individual deplanes. Commentators stated that the 50-percent test should be applied either atthe time the individual boards the aircraft or at the time the individualdeplanes. Other commentators stated the seating capacity rule should bereplaced by a rule providing that the value of a flight is zero if at least50 percent of the passengers on board were flying for the employer's business.The seating capacity rule provided in the proposed regulations reflectsthe provisions of a Treasury Department letter addressed to Senator RobertDole (131 Cong. Rec. S6369 (daily ed. May 16, 1985)). For the reasons citedin the letter, the final regulations retain the seating capacity rule asproposed. Commercial Aircraft Flight Valuation Rule_Space Available Flight For purposes of the definition of a space available flight in the commercialflight valuation rule, the final regulations clarify that a flight willnot be considered a space available flight unless the nondiscriminationrequirements of andSection; 1.132-8 of the regulations is satisfied. No-Additional-Cost Services Prior to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA),a no-additional-cost service (such as a space-available flight on a commercialairline) was excludable from gross income if provided to an employee ofthe airline, the employee's spouse, or the employee's dependent child.The proposed regulations reflect this provision. COBRA amended this rule,however, to provide that the no-additional-cost service exclusion is alsoavailable in the case of air transportation provided to the parents ofan airline employee. The final regulations reflect the COBRA change whichis effective for flights taken after December 31, 1984. COBRA also provided rules concerning the applicability of the no-additional-costservice exclusion to space-available flights provided to employees workingin airline-related services and employees working for qualified air transportationorganizations. In addition, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provided rules concerningthe applicability of the no-additional-cost service exclusion to telephoneservice provided to pre-divestiture employees. The final requlations reflectthese rules which are effective January 1, 1985. Line of Business A no-additional-cost service or a qualified employee discount providedto an employee (or a no-additional-cost service provided pursuant to areciprocal agreement) is only available with respect to property or servicesthat are offered for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the sameline of business in which the employee receiving the property or serviceperforms substantial services. The final regulations clarify that the line of business limitation is notsatisfied if the employer's products or services are sold primarily toemployees of the employer, rather than to customers. Moreover, the finalregulations clarify that the line of business requirement is a limitationupon, and may not be used as a means to expand, the fringe benefits thatmay be offered to employees. Finally, the regulations provide for certain grandfather rules relatingto certain retail stores, telephone services provided to pre-divestitureretirees, certain affiliates of commercial airlines, affiliated groupsoperating airlines, and qualified air transportation organizations.Employer-Operated Eating Facility Rules Section 132(e) provides that gross income does not include the value ofmeals provided at an employer-operated eating facility if revenues fromthe facility normally equal or exceed the direct operating costs of thefacility and certain nondiscrimination rules are satisfied. The proposedregulations defined direct operating costs and provided that the directoperating costs test must be applied to each separate facility operatedby an employer. A special exclusion for the costs and revenues attributableto meals received by volunteers at a hospital, either free or at a discount,has been added in the final regulations. Many commentators stated that administrative burdens would be relievedif employers were allowed to aggregate the costs and revenues of theireating facilities to determine whether the direct operating costs testis met. The final regulations adopt this approach. It should be noted,however, that the final regulations do not permit employers to aggregateeating facilities for purposes of the nondiscrimination rules. The proposed regulations defined an employer-operated eating facility foremployees. One of the conditions provided in those regulations is thatsubstantially all of the use of the facility is by employees of the employer.As requested by commentators, the final regulations remove the restriction.Where the value of meals in an employer-operated eating facility may notbe excluded from income under these regulations, that value must be includedin the employee's income. The final regulations provide that the amountsto be included in the employee's income must be calculated separately withrespect to each separate eating facility, even if the facilities were aggregatedfor other purposes. The final regulations clarify that the individual meal subsidy rule isonly available if a charge is made to each employee for each meal selectionand if each employee is charged the same price for any given meal selection.Finally, for purposes of applying the total meal subsidy rule, the finalregulations provide that an employer may only allocate the total meal subsidyon a per-employee basis if such employer has information that would substantiatethat each employee was provided approximately the same number of mealsat the facility. Working Condition Fringes_In General The final regulations provide additional examples to illustrate many ofthe working condition fringe benefit rules.The final regulations further provide that in lieu of excluding the valueof a working condition fringe with respect to an automobile, an employerusing the automobile lease valuation rule may include in an employee'sgross income the entire Annual Lease Value of the automobile. Security Transportation The value of transportation provided for security reasons may be excludablefrom gross income as a working condition fringe to the extent a deductionunder section 162 or 167 would be allowable to the employee had the employeepaid for the same mode of transportation. The proposed regulations provided guidance on when bona fide business-orientedsecurity concerns exist both in and outside the United States. Commentatorsstated that the regulations should not distinguish between security providedin and outside the United States. In addition, commentators stated thatthe final regulations should provide that the security concerns listedin the proposed regulations are merely examples of when bona fide business-orientedsecurity concerns exist and are not the only ways to demonstrate such concerns.Commentators also suggested that the final regulations provide additionalexamples of when security concerns exist. In response to comments, the final regulations eliminate the domestic/foreigndistinction and provide the following examples of factors indicating theexistence of bona fide business-oriented security concerns_death threats,threats of kidnapping or serious bodily harm, and a history of violentterrorist activity in the relevant geographic area. If transportation is provided for security reasons to the spouse or dependentsof an employee, the proposed regulations provide that the security rulesmust be satisfied independently with respect to those individuals. Commentatorsstated that the security rules should be treated as satisfied with respectto the spouse and dependents of an employee if they are satisfied withrespect to the employee. The final regulations provide that if a bona fide business-oriented securityconcern is deemed to exist with respect to an employee, such concern isdeemed to exist with respect to the spouse and dependents of the employeeas well. If the requirements for a security program are then satisfiedwith respect to the spouse and dependents, the excess value attributableto security provided for their protection is excludable from the employee'sgross income. The final regulations provide that when an employee's spouse and dependentsfly on board the same aircraft as the employee for a bona fide business-orientedsecurity concern, the requirements for a security program are deemed tobe satisfied with respect to the spouse and dependents for that flight.In all other situations, the security program requirements must be satisfiedindependently with respect to the spouse and dependents of an employee.Moreover, the regulations clarify that for purposes of the working conditionsafe harbor for travel on an employer-provided aircraft because of a bonafide business-oriented security concern, the value of the safe harbor airfareis determined under the non-commercial flight special valuation rule byrequiring the employee to include in income 200 percent of the applicablecents-per-mile rate and then adding the applicable terminal charge. Commentators requested that the final regulations clarify the tax treatmentto the employee of a bodyguard/chauffeur provided to such employee forsecurity reasons. The final regulations provide that if the security rulesare satisfied, the entire value of the services of a bodyguard/chauffeurare excludable from the gross income of the protected employee as a workingcondition fringe. The final regulations require that a bodyguard/chauffeurbe trained in evasive driving techniques. Product Testing Based on the legislative history of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the proposedregulations provided that the value of the use of consumer goods providedto employees under a product testing program may be excluded from grossincome as a working condition fringe. Commentators also requested that the final regulations provide that certainconditions of the product testing exclusion are not violated if the employercharges the employee for the personal use of the product, such as an automobile.In response to this suggestion, the final regulations provide that anycharge by the employer for the personal use by an employee of a productbeing tested shall be taken into account in determining whether the employerhas imposed limits on the employee's use of the product that significantlyreduce the value of the personal benefit to the employee. Qualified Automobile Demonstration Use Section 132(h)(3) provides an exclusion for the value of the qualifiedautomobile demonstration use of demonstration automobiles by full-timeautomobile salesmen. The proposed regulations defined a full-time automobilesalesman as an individual who is employed by the dealership, customarilyspends substantially all of a normal business day on the sales floor sellingautomobiles of the dealership, and derives at least 85 percent of his grossincome from the dealership directly as a result of his sales activities.Commentators stated that full-time automobile salesmen do not necessarilyspend most of the business day on the sales floor, but that they engagein sales activities off the dealership premises. In response, the finalregulations amend the definition of a full-time salesman to provide thatthe employee must customarily spend at least half of a normal businessday performing the functions of a floor salesperson or sales manager andmust directly engage in substantial promotion and negotiation of salesto customers. In response to comments, the final regulations also reduce the 85-percentincome test to a 25-percent income test. Shared Usage of Qualified Nonpersonal Use Vehicle The proposed regulations provided that 100% of the value of the use ofa qualified nonpersonal use vehicle is excluded from the gross income ofthe employee. The final regulations provide that, in general, a workingcondition fringe is available to the driver and all passengers of a qualifiednonpersonal use vehicle. However, a working condition fringe exclusionfor a qualified nonpersonal use vehicle is available only with respectto the driver and not with respect to any of the passengers of a passengerbus or school bus.Parking The final regulations provide that if an employer provides an employeewith a general transportation allowance, and the employee is not requiredto use such allowance for parking, no portion of such amount is excludableas a parking expense even if those funds  are actually used for parking.De minimis Fringes The proposed regulations provided a special de minimis fringe exclusionfor the value of public transit passes that do not exceed $15 per monthprovided to employees to defray commuting expenses. Commentators statedthat this exclusion should also apply if the employer provides vouchersor similar instruments exchangeable solely for tokens, farecards, or otherinstruments that enable the employee to use the transit system. The finalregulations adopt this suggestion (subject to the $15 per month limit).The proposed regulations also provided a special de minimis exclusion foroccasional meal money or local transportation fare provided to employeeswhose normal workday is extended because of overtime work. Commentatorsrequested a definition of the term ``occasional.'' In response, the finalregulations provide guidance on this issue. The final regulations also provide special rules for local transportationfare provided in unusual circumstances and for security reasons. Theserules permit an exclusion from gross income for the fare that exceeds $1.50per one-way commute. The final regulations define when unusual circumstancesand security concerns exist. Nondiscrimination Rules The proposed regulations provided guidance concerning the nondiscriminationrequirements applicable to no-additional-cost services, qualified employeediscounts, and employer-operated eating facilities for employees. Underthese rules, the value of benefits provided to officers, owners, or highlycompensated employees could not be excluded from their gross incomes unlessthe benefits were available on substantially the same terms to either (1)all of the employees of the employer or (2) each member of a group of employeesthat is defined under a reasonable classification that does not discriminatein favor of such employees. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changes the prohibitedgroup of employees to ``highly compensated employees'' defined as any employeewho (1) is a five percent or greater owner, (2) received compensation inexcess of $75,000, (3) received compensation in excess of $50,000 and whowas in the top-paid 20 percent of employees, or (4) was an officer of theemployer at any time and received compensation greater than 150 percentof the section 415(c)(1)(A) limit for this year. The final regulationsreflect this change. The employees who may be excluded from consideration have been changedin the final regulations. The proposed regulations included unionized employeesunless all such employees were excluded. The final regulations excludethose employees who may be excluded from consideration under section 89(h).A special nondiscrimination rule applies for benefits allocated on a senioritybasis. In such circumstances, a benefit shall not fail to be treated asavailable to a group of employees on substantially the same terms if (1)notice of the terms of availability is provided to all employees in thegroup; and (2) the average value of the benefit provided per non-highlycompensated employee is at least 75% of that provided per highly compensatedemployee. In determining the average value of benefit provided, all employee'sof the employer are counted, including those who receive no benefit fromthe employer. Definition of Compensation Generally, for purposes of the final regulations, a uniform definitionof compensation has been added. Compensation is generally defined as theamount determined under section 414(q)(7). A chauffeur's compensation isdefined as the sum of the amount determined under section 414(q)(7) plusthe value of nontaxable lodging. Consumer Price Index Adjustments The final regulations generally provide that the limitations on the applicablevalues of vehicles for purposes of the special valuation rules (e.g., the$16,500 limitation on vehicles for use of the fleet average valuation rule)are to be adjusted annually for changes in the consumer price index automobilecomponent. Similar adjustments to reflect changes in the consumer priceindex are to be made to the compensation limitations provided in the definitionof control employee. Prizes and Awards These regulations do not address issues concerning prizes and awards. Separateguidance will be provided with respect to those issues. Frequent Flyer These regulations do not address issues concerning the tax treatment offrequent flyer bonus programs, and similar programs because these issuesare still under consideration. <ITAG tagnum="85">Executive Order 12291, Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Paperwork ReductionAct </ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this final ruleis not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291 and that a regulatoryimpact analysis is therefore not required. Although a notice of proposed rulemaking that solicited public commentwas issued, the Internal Revenue Service concluded when the notice of proposedrulemaking was issued that the regulations are interpretative and thatthe notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 did not apply.Accordingly, the final regulations do not constitute regulations subjectto the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. Chapter 6). <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of these final regulations is Rhonda G.

Section 61(a)(1) provides that, except as otherwiseprovided in subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, gross incomeincludes compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringebenefits, and similar items. For an outline of the regulations under thissection relating to fringe benefits, see paragraph (a)(7) of this section.Examples of fringe benefits include: an employer-provided automobile, aflight on an employer-provided aircraft, an employer-provided free or discountedcommercial airline flight, an employer-provided vacation, an employer-provideddiscount on property or services, an employer-provided membership in acountry club or other social club, and an employer-provided ticket to anentertainment or sporting event. (2) <T3>Fringe benefits excluded from income. </T3>To the extent that a particularfringe benefit is specifically excluded from gross income pursuant to anothersection of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, that sectionshall govern the treatment of that fringe benefit. Thus, if the requirementsof the governing section are satisfied, the fringe benefits may be excludablefrom gross income. Examples of excludable fringe benefits include qualifiedtuition reductions provided to an employee (section 117(d)); meals or lodgingfurnished to an employee for the convenience of the employer (section 119);benefits provided under a dependent care assistance program (section 129);and no-additional-cost services, qualified employee discounts, workingcondition fringes, and de minimis fringes (section 132). Similarly, thevalue of the use by an employee of an employer-provided vehicle or a flightprovided to an employee on an employer-provided aircraft may be excludablefrom income under section 105 (because, for example, the transportationis provided for medical reasons) if and to the extent that the requirementsof that section are satisfied. Section 134 excludes from gross income ``qualifiedmilitary benefits.'' An example of a benefit that is not a qualified militarybenefit is the personal use of an employer-provided vehicle. The fact thatanother section of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code addresses thetaxation of a particular fringe benefit will not preclude section 61 andthe regulations thereunder from applying, to the extent that they are notinconsistent with such other section. For example, many fringe benefitsspecifically addressed in other sections of subtitle A of the InternalRevenue Code are excluded from gross income only to the extent that theydo not exceed specific dollar or percentage limits, or only if certainother requirements are met. If the limits are exceeded or the requirementsare not met, some or all of the fringe benefit may be includible in grossincome pursuant to section 61. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (3) <T3>Compensation for services. </T3>A fringe benefit provided in connectionwith the performance of services shall be considered to have been providedas compensation for such services. Refraining from the performance of services(such as pursuant to a covenant not to compete) is deemed to be the performanceof services for purposes of this section. (4) <T3>Person to whom fringe benefit is taxable</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>A taxable fringe benefit is included in the incomeof the person performing the services in connection with which the fringebenefit is furnished. Thus, a fringe benefit may be taxable to a personeven though that person did not actually receive the fringe benefit. Ifa fringe benefit is furnished to someone other than the service providersuch benefit is considered in this section as furnished to the serviceprovider, and use by the other person is considered use by the serviceprovider. For example, the provision of an automobile by an employer toan employee's spouse in connection with the performance of services bythe employee is taxable to the employee. The automobile is considered availableto the employee and use by the employee's spouse is considered use by theemployee. (ii) <T3>All persons to whom benefits are taxable referred to as employees.</T3>The person to whom a fringe benefit is taxable need not be an employeeof the provider of the fringe benefit, but may be, for example, a partner,director, or an independent contractor. For convenience, the term ``employee''includes any person performing services in connection with which a fringebenefit is furnished, unless otherwise specifically provided in this section.(5) <T3>Provider of a fringe benefit referred to as an employer. </T3>The ``provider''of a fringe benefit is that person for whom the services are performed,regardless of whether that person actually provides the fringe benefitto the recipient. The provider of a fringe benefit need not be the employerof the recipient of the fringe benefit, but may be, for example, a clientor customer of the employer or of an independent contractor. For convenience,the term ``employer'' includes any provider of a fringe benefit in connectionwith payment for the performance of services, unless otherwise specificallyprovided in this section. (6) <T3>Effective date. </T3>Except as otherwise provided, this section iseffective as of January 1, 1989 with respect to fringe benefits providedafter December 31, 1988.

Therefore, for example, if the employee pays fair market value for whatis received, no amount is includible in the gross income of the employee.In general, the determination of the fair market value of a fringe benefitmust be made before subtracting out the amount, if any, paid for the benefitand the amount, if any, specifically excluded from gross income by anothersection of subtitle A. See paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) of thissection. (2) <T3>Fair market value.</T3> In general, fair market value is determinedon the basis of all the facts and circumstances. Specifically, the fairmarket value of a fringe benefit is the amount that an individual wouldhave to pay for the particular fringe benefit in an arm's-length transaction.Thus, for example, the effect of any special relationship that may existbetween the employer and the employee must be disregarded. Similarly, anemployee's subjective perception of the value of a fringe benefit is notrelevant to the determination of the fringe benefit's fair market valuenor is the cost incurred by the employer determinative of its fair marketvalue. For special rules relating to the valuation of certain fringe benefits,see paragraph (c) of this section. (3) <T3>Exclusion from income based on cost.</T3> If a statutory exclusionphrased in terms of cost applies to the provision of a fringe benefit,section 61 does not require the inclusion in the recipient's gross incomeof the difference between the fair market value and the excludable costof that fringe benefit. For example, section 129 provides an exclusionfrom an employee's gross income for amounts contributed by an employerto a dependent care assistance program for employees. Even if the fairmarket value of the dependent care assistance exceeds the employer's cost,the excess is not subject to inclusion under section 61 and this section.However, if the statutory cost exclusion is a limited amount, the fairmarket value of the fringe benefit attributable to any excess cost is subjectto inclusion. This would be the case, for example, where an employer paysor incurs a cost of more than $5,000 to provide dependent care assistanceto an employee. (4) <T3>Fair market value of the availability of an employer-provided vehicle</T3>_(i)<T3>In general.</T3> If the vehicle special valuation rules of paragraph(d), (e), or (f) of this section do not apply with respect to an employer-providedvehicle, the value of the availability of that vehicle is determined underthe general valuation principles set forth in this section. In general,that value equals the amount that an individual would have to pay in anarm's-length transaction to lease the same or comparable vehicle on thesame or comparable conditions in the geographic area in which the vehicleis available for use. An example of a comparable condition is the amountof time that the vehicle is available to the employee for use, e.g., aone-year period. Unless the employee can substantiate that the same orcomparable vehicle could have been leased on a cents-per-mile basis, thevalue of the availability of the vehicle cannot be computed by applyinga cents-per-mile rate to the number of miles the vehicle is driven. (ii) <T3>Certain equipment excluded.</T3> The fair market value of a vehicledoes not include the fair market value of any specialized equipment notsusceptible to personal use or any telephone that is added to or carriedin the vehicle, provided that the presence of that equipment or telephoneis necessitated by, and attributable to, the business needs of the employer.However, the value of specialized equipment must be included, if the employeeto whom the vehicle is available uses the specialized equipment in a tradeor business of the employee other than the employee's trade or businessof being an employee of the employer. (5) <T3>Fair market value of chauffeur services</T3>_(i) <T3>Determination of value</T3>_(A) <T3>In general.</T3> The fair market value of chauffeur services providedto the employee by the employer is the amount that an individual wouldhave to pay in an arm's-length transaction to obtain the same or comparablechauffeur services in the geographic area for the period in which the servicesare provided. In determining the applicable fair market value, the amountof time, if any, the chauffeur remains on-call to perform chauffeur servicesmust be included. For example, assume that A, an employee of corporationM, needs a chauffeur to be on-call to provide services to A during a twenty-fourhour period. If during that twenty-four hour period, the chauffeur actuallydrives A for only six hours, the fair market value of the chauffeur serviceswould have to be the value of having a chauffeur on-call for a twenty-fourhour period. The cost of taxi fare or limousine service for the six hoursthe chauffeur actually drove A would not be an accurate measure of thefair market value of chauffeur services provided to A. Moreover, all otheraspects of the chauffeur's services (including any special qualificationsof the chauffeur (e.g., training in evasive driving skills) or the abilityof the employee to choose the particular chauffeur) must be taken intoconsideration. (B) <T3>Alternative valuation with reference to compensation paid.</T3> Alternatively,the fair market value of the chauffeur services may be determined by referenceto the compensation (as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section)received by the chauffeur from the employer. (C) <T3>Separate valuation for chauffeur services.</T3> The value of chauffeurservices is determined separately from the value of the availability ofan employer-provided vehicle. (ii) <T3>Definition of compensation</T3>_(A) <T3>In general.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii), the term``compensation'' means compensation as defined in section 414(q)(7) andthe fair market value of nontaxable lodging (if any) provided by the employerto the chauffeur in the current year. (B) <T3>Adjustments to compensation</T3>_For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii),a chauffeur's compensation is reduced proportionately to reflect the amountof time during which the chauffeur performs substantial services for theemployer other than as a chauffeur and is not on-call as a chauffeur. Forexample, assume a chauffeur is paid $25,000 a year for working a ten-hourday, five days a week and also receives $5,000 in nontaxable lodging. Furtherassume that during four hours of each day, the chauffeur is not on-callto perform services as a chauffeur because that individual is performingsecretarial functions for the employer. Then, for purposes of determiningthe fair market value of this chauffeur's services, the employer may reducethe chauffeur's compensation by \4/10\ or $12,000 (.4andmultiply; ($25,000+$5,000)=$12,000).Therefore, in this example, the fair market value of the chauffeur's servicesis $18,000 ($30,000 ^$12,000). However, for purposes of this paragraph(b)(5)(ii), a chauffeur's compensation is not to be reduced by any amountspaid to the chauffeur for time spent ``on-call,'' even though the chauffeuractually performs other services for the employer during such time. Forpurposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii), a determination that a chauffeuris performing substantial services for the employer other than as a chauffeuris based upon the facts and circumstances of each situation. An employeewill be deemed to be performing substantial services for the employer otherthan as a chauffeur if a certain portion of each working day is regularlyspent performing other services for the employer. (iii) <T3>Calculation of chauffeur services for personal purposes of the employee.</T3>The fair market value of chauffeur services provided to the employee forpersonal purposes may be determined by multiplying the fair market valueof chauffeur services, as determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(i) (A)or (B) of this section, by a fraction, the numerator of which is equalto the sum of the hours spent by the chauffeur actually providing personaldriving services to the employee and the hours spent by the chauffeur in``personal on-call time,'' and the denominator of which is equal to allhours the chauffeur spends in driving services of any kind paid for bythe employer, including all hours that are ``on-call.'' (iv) <T3>Definition of on-call time.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph, theterm ``on-call time'' means the total amount of time that the chauffeuris not engaged in the actual performance of driving services, but duringwhich time the chauffeur is available to perform such services. With respectto a round-trip, time spent by a chauffeur waiting for an employee to makea return trip is generally not treated as on-call time; rather such timeis treated as part of the round-trip.(v) <T3>Definition of personal on-call time. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph,the term ``personal on-call time'' means the amount of time outside theemployee's normal working hours for the employer when the chauffeur isavailable to the employee to perform driving services. (vi) <T3>Presumptions. </T3>(A) An employee's normal working hours will be presumedto consist of a ten hour period during which the employee usually conductsbusiness activities for that employer. (B) It will be presumed that if the chauffeur is on-call to provide drivingservices to an employee during the employee's normal working hours, thenthat on-call time will be performed for business purposes. (C) Similarly, if the chauffeur is on-call to perform driving servicesto an employee after normal working hours, then that on-call time willbe presumed to be ``personal on-call time.'' (D) The presumptions set out in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) (A), (B), and (C)of this section may be rebutted. For example, an employee may demonstrateby adequate substantiation that his or her normal working hours consistof more than ten hours. Furthermore, if the employee keeps adequate recordsand is able to substantiate that some portion of the driving services performedby the chauffeur after normal working hours is attributable to businesspurposes, then personal on-call time may be reduced by an amount equalto such personal on-call time multiplied by a fraction, the numerator ofwhich is equal to the time spent by the chauffeur after normal workinghours driving the employee for business purposes, and the denominator ofwhich is equal to the total time spent by the chauffeur driving the employeeafter normal working hours for all purposes. (vii) <T3>Examples. </T3>The rules of this paragraph (b)(5) may be illustratedby the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>An employer makes available to employee A an automobileand a full-time chauffeur B (who performs no other services for A's employer)for an entire calendar year. Assume that the automobile lease valuationrule of paragraph (d) of this section is used and that the Annual LeaseValue of the automobile is $9,250. Assume further that B's compensationfor the year is $12,000 (as defined in section 414(q)(7)) and that B isfurnished lodging with a value of $3,000 that is excludable from B's grossincome. The maximum amount subject to inclusion in A's gross income foruse of the automobile and chauffeur is therefore $24,250 ($12,000+$3,000+$9,250).If 70 percent of the miles placed on the automobile during the year arefor A's employer's business, then $6,475 is excludable from A's gross incomewith respect to the automobile as a working condition fringe ($9,250andmultiply;.70).Thus, $2,775 is includible in A's gross income with respect to the automobile($9,250^$6,475). With respect to the chauffeur, if 20 percent of the chauffeur'stime is spent actually driving A or being on-call to drive A for personalpurposes; then $3,000 is includible in A's income (.20andmultiply;$15,000).Eighty percent of $15,000, or $12,000, is excluded from A's income as aworking condition fringe.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1) except thatin addition to providing chauffeur services, B is responsible for performingsubstantial non-chauffeur-related duties (such as clerical or secretarialfunctions) during which time B is not ``on-call'' as a chauffeur.

(ii) <T3>Value of flight.</T3> If an employee takes a flight on an employer-providedpiloted aircraft and that employee's flight is primarily personal (seeandSection; 1.162-2(b)(2)), the value of the flight is equal to the amountthat an individual would have to pay in an arm's-length transaction tocharter the same or a comparable piloted aircraft for that period for thesame or a comparable flight. A flight taken under these circumstances maynot be valued by reference to the cost of commercial airfare for the sameor a comparable flight. The cost to charter the aircraft must be allocatedamong all employees on board the aircraft based on all the facts and circumstancesunless one or more of the employees controlled the use of the aircraft.Where one or more employees control the use of the aircraft, the valueof the flight shall be allocated solely among such controlling employees,unless a written agreement among all the employees on the flight otherwiseallocates the value of such flight. Notwithstanding the allocation requiredby the preceding sentence, no additional amount shall be included in theincome of any employee whose flight is properly valued under the specialvaluation rule of paragraph (g) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph(b)(6), ``control'' means the ability of the employee to determine theroute, departure time and destination of the flight. The rules providedin paragraph (g)(3) of this section will be used for purposes of this sectionin defining a flight. Notwithstanding the allocation required by the precedingsentence, no additional amount shall be included in the income of an employeefor that portion of any such flight which is excludible from income pursuantto section 132(d) or andSection; 1.132-5 as a working condition fringe. (iii) <T3>Examples.</T3> The rules of paragraph (b)(6) of this section may beillustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> An employer makes available to employees A and Ba piloted aircraft in New York, New York. A wants to go to Los Angeles,California for personal purposes. B needs to go to Chicago, Illinois forbusiness purposes, and then wants to go to Los Angeles, California forpersonal purposes. Therefore, the aircraft first flies to Chicago, andB deplanes and then boards the plane again. The aircraft then flies toLos Angeles, California where A and B deplane. The value of the flightto employee A will be no more than the amount that an individual wouldhave to pay in an arm's length transaction to charter the same or a comparablepiloted aircraft for the same or comparable flight from New York City toLos Angeles. No amount will be imputed to employee A for the stop at Chicago.As to employee B, the value of the personal flight will be no more thanthe value or the flight from Chicago to Los Angeles. Pursuant to the rulesset forth in andSection; 1.132-5(k), the flight from New York to Chicagowill not be included in employee B's income since that flight was takensolely for business purposes. The charter cost must be allocated betweenA and B, since both employees controlled portions of the flight. Assumethat the employer allocates according to the relative value of each employee'sflight. If the charter value of A's flight from New York City to Los Angelesis $1,000 and the value of B's flight from Chicago to Los Angeles is $600and the value of the actual flight from New York to Chicago to Los Angelesis $1,200, then the amount to be allocated to employee A is $750 ($1,000/($1,000+$600)andmultiply;$1,200)and the amount to be allocated to employee B is $450 ($600/($1000+$600)andmultiply;$1,200).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatemployee A also deplanes at Chicago, Illinois, but for personal purposes.The value of the flight to employee A then becomes the value of a flightfrom New York to Chicago to Los Angeles, i.e., $1,200. Therefore, the amountto be allocated to employee A is $800 ($1,200/($1,200+$600)andmultiply;$1,200)and the amount to be allocated to employee B is $400 ($600/($1,200+$600)andmultiply;$1,200).</ITAG>(7) <T3>Fair market value of the use of an employer-provided aircraft for whichthe employer does not furnish a pilot.</T3> (i) <T3>In general.</T3> If the non-commercial flight special valuation ruleof paragraph (g) of this section does not apply and if an employer providesan employee with the use of an aircraft without a pilot, the value of theuse of the employer-provided aircraft is determined under the general valuationprinciples set forth in this paragraph (b)(7). (ii) <T3>Value of flight.</T3> In general, if an employee takes a flight onan employer-provided aircraft for which the employer does not furnish apilot, the value of that flight is equal to the amount that an individualwould have to pay in an arm's-length transaction to lease the same or comparableaircraft on the same or comparable terms for the same period in the geographicarea in which the aircraft is used. For example, if an employer makes itsaircraft available to an employee who will pilot the aircraft for a two-hourflight, the value of the use of the aircraft is the amount that an individualwould have to pay in an arm's-length transaction to rent a comparable aircraftfor that period in the geographic area in which the aircraft is used. Asanother example, assume that an employee uses an employer-provided aircraftto commute between home and work. The value of the use of the aircraftis the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm's-length transactionto rent a comparable aircraft for commuting in the geographic area in whichthe aircraft is used. If the availability of the flight is of benefit tomore than one employee, then such value shall be allocated among such employeeson the basis of the relevant facts and circumstances. (c) <T3>Special valuation rule_</T3>(1) <T3>In general.</T3> Paragraphs (d) through (j) of this section providespecial valuation rules that may be used under certain circumstances forcertain commonly provided fringe benefits. For general rules relating tothe valuation of fringe benefits not eligible for valuation under the specialvaluation rules, see paragraph (b) of this section. (2) <T3>Use of the special valuation rules</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> The special valuation rules may be used for incometax, employment tax, and reporting purposes. The employer has the optionto use any of the special valuation rules. However, an employee may onlyuse a special valuation rule if the employer uses the rule. Moreover, anemployee may only use the special rule that the employer uses to valuethe benefit provided; the employee may not use another special rule tovalue that benefit. The employee may always use general valuation rulesbased on facts and circumstances (see paragraph (b) of this section) evenif the employer uses a special rule. If a special rule is used, it mustbe used for all purposes. If an employer properly uses a special rule andthe employee uses the special rule, the employee must include in grossincome the amount determined by the employer under the special rule reducedby the sum of_(A) Any amount reimbursed by the employee to the employer, and (B) Any amount excludable from income under another section of subtitleA of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If an employer properly uses aspecial rule and properly determines the amount of an employee's workingcondition fringe under section 132 and andSection; 1.132-5 (under the generalrule or under a special rule), and the employee uses the special valuationrule, the employee must include in gross income the amount determined bythe employer less any amount reimbursed by the employee to the employer.The employer and employee may use the special rules to determine the amountof the reimbursement due the employer by the employee. Thus, if an employeereimburses an employer for the value of a benefit as determined under aspecial valuation rule, no amount is includable in the employee's grossincome with respect to the benefit. (ii) <T3>Vehicle special valuation rules</T3>_(A) <T3>Vehicle by vehicle basis.</T3> Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(7)(v)and (e)(5)(v) of this section, the vehicle special valuation rules of paragraphs(d), (e), and (f) of this section apply on a vehicle by vehicle basis.An employer need not use the same vehicle special valuation rule for allvehicles provided to all employees. For example, an employer may use theautomobile lease valuation rule for automobiles provided to some employees,and the commuting and vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rules for automobilesprovided to other employees. For purposes of valuing the use or availabilityof a vehicle, the consistency rules provided in paragraphs (d)(7) and (e)(5)of this section (relating to the automobile lease valuation rule and thevehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule, respectively) apply. (B) <T3>Shared vehicle usage.</T3> If an employer provides a vehicle to employeesfor use by more than one employee at the same time, such as with an employer-sponsoredvehicle commuting pool, the employer may use any of the special valuationrules that may be applicable to value the use of the vehicle by the employees.The employer must use the same special valuation rule to value the useof the vehicle by each employee who shares such use. The employer mustallocate the value of the use of the vehicle based on the relevant factsand circumstances among the employees who share use of the vehicle. Forexample, assume that an employer provides an automobile to four of itsemployees and that the employees use the automobile in an employer-sponsoredvehicle commuting pool. Assume further that the employer uses the automobilelease valuation rule of paragraph (d) of this section and that the AnnualLease Value of the automobile is $5,000. The employer must treat $5,000 as the value of the availability of theautomobile to the employees, and must apportion the $5,000 value amongthe employees who share the use of the automobile based on the relevantfacts and circumstances. Each employee's share of the value of the availabilityof the automobile is then to be reduced by the amount, if any, of eachemployee's working condition fringe exclusion and the amount reimbursedby the employee to the employer. (iii) <T3>Commercial and noncommercial flight valuation rules.</T3> Except asotherwise provided, if either the commercial flight valuation rule or thenon-commercial flight valuation rule is used, that rule must be used byan employer to value all eligible flights taken by all employees in a calendaryear. See paragraph (g)(14) of this section for the applicable consistencyrules. (3) <T3>Election to use the special valuation rules</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> A particular special valuation rule is deemed to havebeen elected by the employer (and, if applicable, by the employee), ifthe employer (and, if applicable, the employee) determines the value ofthe fringe benefit provided by applying the special valuation rule andtreats that value as the fair market value of the fringe benefit for income,employment tax, and reporting purposes. Neither the employer nor the employeemust notify the Internal Revenue Service of the election. (ii) <T3>Notification to employee.</T3> (A) <T3>Requirement to provide notice.</T3> An employer who elects to use aspecial valuation rule must notify the employee of the election by thelater of January 31 of the calendar year for which the election is to apply,October 31 for calendar year 1989 or 30 days after the employer first providesthe benefit to the employee. If an employer elected to use a special valuationrule for the immediately preceding calendar year and notified the affectedemployee in the manner prescribed by this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), then theemployer need not notify the employee that the employer elects to continueusing the same special valuation rule. If, consistent with the rules ofparagraphs (d)(7) and (e)(5) of this section, an employer elects to discontinueusing a special valuation rule and either elects to use another specialvaluation rule or applies general valuation principles to determine thevalue of the employer-provided benefit, the employer must notify the affectedemployee of the change in election in the manner prescribed by this paragraph(c)(3)(ii). (B) <T3>Content of notice.</T3> The notice required by this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)must state that an employer is electing to use a special valuation rulefor valuing a benefit provided to an employee (or is discontinuing theuse of such a rule if that is the case). The notice must also alert employeesto any applicable section 274(d) substantiation requirements and to theeffect of failure to comply with such requirements. In addition, the noticemust state the date on which the notice is provided. If an employer isnot certain which vehicle special valuation rule will be applied with respectto a particular employer-provided vehicle, the employer must notify theaffected employee of the special valuation rules that the employer mayapply. For example, if an employer intends to use either the automobilelease valuation rule or the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule dependingupon which rule yields a lesser amount of taxable income with respect tothe use of a particular vehicle (or, alternatively, with respect to theuse of a specific group of vehicles), the employer must notify the affectedemployee that the employer elects to use either of the specified valuationrules depending on which rule yields a lesser amount of taxable incomewith respect to the vehicle (or, alternatively, with respect to the specifiedgroup of vehicles). (C) <T3>Manner of providing notification to employee.</T3> The notice requiredby this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) must be provided in a manner reasonably expectedto come to the attention of all affected employees. For example, this maybe accomplished by providing the notice directly to the employee in a mailingor with the employee's paycheck, or by posting the notice at a locationwhere there is a strong likelihood that the notice will be read by allaffected employees. (D) <T3>Failure to provide notice.</T3> Except as provided in this paragraph(c)(3)(ii)(D), with respect to benefits provided in a calendar year, ifan employer does not provide notice of an election to use a special valuationrule at the time and in the manner prescribed by this paragraph (c)(3)(ii),the employer may not use any such special valuation rule or any relatedspecial valuation rule to value the benefit provided in such year to employeeswho were not so notified but rather must use general valuation principles.However, if before January 31 of the year following the year in which noticewas not provided, the employer receives written notification from an employeewho was not notified, and such notification clearly indicates that theemployee knows of (<T3>1</T3>) The employer's use of a special valuation rule,(<T3>2</T3>) The substantiation requirements that apply with respect tothe special valuation rule, and(<T3>3</T3>) The effect of a failure to comply with such requirements,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">the employer may use the special valuation rule identified in thewritten employee notification with respect to the benefit provided to suchemployee. The rules set out in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) also apply,with appropriate adjustments, when an employer is discontinuing the useof a special valuation rule.(4)<T3> Application of section 414 to employers.</T3> For purposes of paragraphs(c) through (j) of this section, except as otherwise provided therein,the term ``employer'' includes all entities required to be treated as asingle employer under section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o).(5) <T3>Valuation formulae contained in the special valuation rules.</T3> Thevaluation formula contained in the special valuation rules are providedonly for use in connection with those rules. Thus, when a special valuationrule is properly applied to a fringe benefit, the Commissioner will acceptthe value calculated pursuant to the rule as the fair market value of thatfringe benefit. However, when a special valuation rule is not properlyapplied to a fringe benefit (see, for example, paragraph (g)(13) of thissection), or when a special valuation rule is used to value a fringe benefitby a taxpayer not entitled to use the rule, the fair market value of thatfringe benefit may not be determined by reference to any value calculatedunder any special valuation rule. Under the circumstances described inthe preceding sentence, the fair market value of the fringe benefit mustbe determined pursuant to the general valuation rules of paragraph (b)of this section.(6)<T3> Modification of the special valuation rules. </T3>The Commissionermay, to the extent necessary for tax administration, add, delete, or modifyany special valuation rule, including the valuation formulae containedherein, on a prospective basis by regulation, revenue ruling or revenueprocedure. (7)<T3> Special accounting rule. </T3>If the employer is using the specialaccounting rule provided in Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B. 31, August5, 1985) (relating to the reporting of and withholding on the value ofnoncash fringe benefits), benefits which are deemed provided in a subsequentcalendar year pursuant to that rule are considered as provided in thatsubsequent calendar year for purposes of the special valuation rules (includingthe notice requirements). Thus, if a particular special valuation ruleis in effect for a calendar year, it applies to benefits deemed providedduring that calendar year under the special accounting rule.(d) <T3>Automobile lease valuation rule</T3>_(1) <T3>In general</T3>_(i) <T3>Annual Lease Value.</T3> Under the special valuation rule of this paragraph(d), if an employer provides an employee with an automobile that is availableto the employee for an entire calendar year, the value of the benefit providedis the Annual Lease Value (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section)of that automobile. Except as otherwise provided, for an automobile thatis available to an employee for less than an entire calendar year, thevalue of the benefit provided is either a pro-rated Annual Lease Valueor the Daily Lease Value (both as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section),whichever is applicable. Absent any statutory exclusion relating to theemployer-provided automobile (see, for example, section 132(a)(3) and andSection;1.132-5(b)), the amount of the Annual Lease Value (or a pro-rated AnnualLease Value or the Daily Lease Value, as applicable) is included in thegross income of the employee.(ii)<T3> Definition of automobile.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (d),the term ``automobile'' means any four-wheeled vehicle manufactured primarilyfor use on public streets, roads, and highways.(2) <T3>Calculation of Annual Lease Value</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> The Annual Lease Value of a particular automobileis calculated as follows:(A) Determine the fair market value of the automobile as of the first dateon which the automobile is made available to any employee of the employerfor personal use. For an automobile first made available to any employeefor personal use prior to January 1, 1985, determine the fair market valueas of January l of the first year the special valuation rule of this paragraph(d) is used with respect to the automobile. For rules relating to determinationof the fair market value of an automobile for purposes of this paragraph(d), see paragraph (d)(5) of this section.(B) Select the dollar range in column 1 of the Annual Lease Value Table,set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section corresponding to thefair market value of the automobile. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs(d)(2) (iv) and (v) of this section, the Annual Lease Value for each yearof availability of the automobile is the corresponding amount in column2 of the Table.(ii) <T3>Calculation of Annual Lease Value of automobile owned or leased byboth an employer and an employee</T3>_(A) <T3>Purchased automobiles.</T3> Notwithstanding anything in this sectionto the contrary, if an employee contributes an amount toward the purchaseprice of an automobile in return for a percentage ownership interest inthe automobile, the Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease Value, whicheveris applicable, is determined by reducing the fair market value of the employer-providedautomobile by the lesser of_(<T3>1</T3>) The amount contributed, or(<T3>2</T3>) An amount equal to the employee's percentage ownership interestmultiplied by the unreduced fair market value of the automobile.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">If the automobile is subsequently revalued, the revalued amount (determinedwithout regard to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A)) is reduced by an amountwhich is equal to the employee's percentage ownership interest in the vehicle).If the employee does not receive an ownership interest in the employer-providedautomobile, then the Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease Value, whicheveris applicable, is determined without regard to any amount contributed.For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A), an employee's ownership interestin an automobile will not be recognized unless it is reflected in the titleof the automobile. An ownership interest reflected in the title of an automobilewill not be recognized if under the facts and circumstances the title doesnot reflect the benefits and burdens of ownership.(B)<T3> Leased automobiles.</T3> Notwithstanding anything in this sectionto the contrary, if an employee contributes an amount toward the cost tolease an automobile in return for a percentage interest in the automobilelease, the Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease Value, whichever is applicable,is determined by reducing the fair market value of the employer-providedautomobile by the amount specified in the following sentence. The amountspecified in this sentence is the unreduced fair market value of a vehiclemultiplied by the lesser of_(<T3>1</T3>) The employee's percentage interest in the lease, or(<T3>2</T3>) A fraction, the numerator of which is the amount contributedand the denominator of which is the entire lease cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">If the automobile is subsequently revalued, the revalued amount (determinedwithout regard to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)) is reduced by an amountwhich is equal to the employee's percentage interest in the lease) multipliedby the revalued amount. If the employee does not receive an interest inthe automobile lease, then the Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease Value,whichever is applicable, is determined without regard to any amount contributed.For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B), an employee's interest inan automobile lease will not be recognized unless the employee is a namedco-lessee on the lease. An interest in a lease will not be recognized ifunder the facts and circumstances the lease does not reflect the true obligationsof the lessees.(C)<T3> Example. </T3>The rules of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of thissection are illustrated by the following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example.</T3> Assume that an employer pays $15,000 and an employeepays $5,000 toward the purchase of an automobile. Assume further that theemployee receives a 25 percent interest in the automobile and is namedas a co-owner on the title to the automobile. Under the rule of paragraph(d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the Annual Lease Value of the automobileis determined by reducing the fair market value of the automobile ($20,000)by the $5,000 employee contribution. Thus, the Annual Lease Value of theautomobile under the table in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section is$4,350. If the employee in this example does not receive an ownership interestin the automobile and is provided the use of the automobile for two years,the Annual Lease Value would be determined without regard to the $5,000employee contribution. Thus, the Annual Lease Value would be $5,600. The$5,000 employee contribution would reduce the amount includible in theemployee's income after taking into account the amount, if any, excludedfrom income under another provision of subtitle A of the Internal RevenueCode, such as the working condition fringe exclusion. Thus, if the employeeplaces 50 percent of the mileage on the automobile for the employer's businesseach year, then the amount includible in the employee's income in the firstyear would be ($5,600-2,800-2,800), or $0, the amount includible in theemployee's income in the second year would be ($5,600-2,800-2,200 ($5,000-2,800))or $600 and the amount includible in the third year would be ($5,600-2,800)or $2,800 since the employee's contribution has been completely used inthe first two years.</ITAG>(iii ) <T3>Annual Lease Value Table.</T3><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,8</C>  <H1>Automobile fair market value </H1><H2>(1) </H2><H1>Annual lease value </H1><H2>(2)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">$0 to 999 <D>$600 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,000 to 1,999 <D>850 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,000 to 2,999 <D>1,100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,000 to 3,999 <D>1,350 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4,000 to 4,999 <D>1,600 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5,000 to 5,999 <D>1,850 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6,000 to 6,999 <D>2,100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7,000 to 7,999 <D>2,350 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8,000 to 8,999 <D>2,600 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9,000 to 9,999 <D>2,850 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,000 to 10,999<D>3,100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11,000 to 11,999 <D>3,350 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12,000 to 12,999 <D>3,600 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13,000 to 13,999 <D>3,850 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14,000 to 14,999 <D>4,100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15,000 to 15,999 <D>4,350 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">16,000 to 16,999 <D>4,600 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">17,000 to 17,999 <D>4,850 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">18,000 to 18,999 <D>5,100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">19,000 to 19,999 <D>5,350 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20,000 to 20,999<D>5,600 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21,000 to 21,999 <D>5,850 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22,000 to 22,999 <D>6,100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">23,000 to 23,999 <D>6,350 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24,000 to 24,999 <D>6,600 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25,000 to 25,999 <D>6,850 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26,000 to 27,999 <D>7,250 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28,000 to 29,999 <D>7,750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30,000 to 31,999 <D>8,250 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">32,000 to 33,999 <D>8,750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">34,000 to 35,999 <D>9,250 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">36,000 to 37,999 <D>9,750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">38,000 to 39,999 <D>10,250 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40,000 to 41,999 <D>10,750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">42,000 to 43,999 <D>11,250 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">44,000 to 45,999 <D>11,750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">46,000 to 47,999 <D>12,250 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">48,000 to 49,999 <D>12,750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50,000 to 51,999 <D>13,250 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">52,000 to 53,999 <D>13,750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">54,000 to 55,999 <D>14,250 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">56,000 to 57,999 <D>14,750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">58,000 to 59,999 <D>15,250</D></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For vehicles having a fair market value in excess of $59,999, theAnnual Lease Value is equal to: (.25 andmultiply; the fair market value ofthe automobile) + $500. (iv) <T3>Recalculation of Annual Lease Value. </T3>The Annual Lease Values determinedunder the rules of this paragraph (d) are based on four-year lease terms.Therefore, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of thissection, the Annual Lease Value calculated by applying paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section shall remain in effect for the period thatbegins with the first date the special valuation rule of paragraph (d)of this section is applied by the employer to the automobile and ends onDecember 31 of the fourth full calendar year following that date. The AnnualLease Value for each subsequent four-year period is calculated by determiningthe fair market value of the automobile as of the first January 1 followingthe period described in the previous sentence and selecting the amountin column 2 of the Annual Lease Value Table corresponding to the appropriatedollar range in column 1 of the Table. If, however, the employer is usingthe special accounting rule provided in Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B.31, August 5, 1985) (relating to the reporting of and withholding on thevalue of noncash fringe benefits), the employer may calculate the AnnualLease Value for each subsequent four-year period as of the beginning ofthe special accounting period that begins immediately prior to the January1 described in the previous sentence. For example, assume that pursuantto Announcement 85-113, an employer uses the special accounting rule. Assumefurther that beginning on November 1, 1988, the special accounting periodis November 1 to October 31 and that the employer elects to use the specialvaluation rule of this paragraph (d) as of January 1, 1989. The employermay recalculate the Annual Lease Value as of November 1, 1992, rather thanas of January 1, 1993. (v) <T3>Transfer of the automobile to another employee. </T3>Unless the primarypurpose of the transfer is to reduce Federal taxes, if an employer transfersthe use of an automobile from one employee to another employee, the employermay recalculate the Annual Lease Value based on the fair market value ofthe automobile as of January 1 of the calendar year of transfer. If, however,the employer is using the special accounting rule provided in Announcement85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B. 31, August 5, 1985) (relating to the reporting ofand withholding on the value of noncash fringe benefits), the employermay recalculate the Annual Lease Value based on the fair market value ofthe automobile as of the beginning of the special accounting period inwhich the transfer occurs. If the employer does not recalculate the AnnualLease Value, and the employee to whom the automobile is transferred usesthe special valuation rule, the employee may not recalculate the AnnualLease Value. (3) <T3>Services included in, or excluded from, the Annual Lease Value Table</T3>_(i)<T3>Maintenance and insurance included. </T3>The Annual Lease Values containedin the Annual Lease Value Table include the fair market value of maintenanceof, and insurance for, the automobile. Neither an employer nor an employeemay reduce the Annual Lease Value by the fair market value of any serviceincluded in the Annual Lease Value that is not provided by the employer,such as reducing the Annual Lease Value by the fair market value of a maintenanceservice contract or insurance. An employer or employee who wishes to takeinto account only the services actually provided with respect to an automobilemay value the availability of the automobile under the general valuationrules of paragraph (b) of this section. (ii) <T3>Fuel excluded</T3>_(A) <T3>In general. </T3>The Annual Lease Values do not include the fair marketvalue of fuel provided by the employer, whether fuel is provided in kindor its cost is reimbursed by or charged to the employer. Thus, if an employerprovides fuel, the fuel must be valued separately for inclusion in income.(B) <T3>Valuation of fuel provided in kind. </T3>The provision of fuel in kindmay be valued at fair market value based on all the facts and circumstancesor, in the alternative, it may be valued at 5.5 cents per mile for allmiles driven by the employee. However, the provision of fuel in kind maynot be valued at 5.5 cents per mile for miles driven outside the UnitedStates, Canada or Mexico. For purposes of this section, the United Statesincludes the United States, its possessions and its territories. (C) <T3>Valuation of fuel where cost reimbursed by or charged to an employer.</T3>The fair market value of fuel, the cost of which is reimbursed byor charged to an employer, is generally the amount of the actual reimbursementor the amount charged, provided the purchase of the fuel is at arm's-length.(D) <T3>Fleet-average cents-per-mile fuel cost. </T3>If an employer with afleet of at least 20 automobiles that meets the requirements of paragraph(d)(5)(v)(D) of this section reimburses employees for the cost of fuelor allows employees to charge the employer for the cost of fuel, the fairmarket value of fuel provided to those automobiles may be determined byreference to the employer's fleet-average cents-per-mile fuel cost. Thefleet-average cents-per-mile fuel cost is equal to the fleet-average per-gallonfuel cost divided by the fleet-average miles-per-gallon rate. The averagesdescribed in the preceding sentence must be determined by averaging theper-gallon fuel costs and miles-per-gallon rates of a representative sampleof the automobiles in the fleet equal to the greater of ten percent ofthe automobiles in the fleet or 20 automobiles for a representative period,such as a two-month period. In lieu of determining the fleet-average cents-per-milefuel cost, if an employer is using the fleet-average valuation rule ofparagraph (d)(5)(v) of this section and if determining the amount of theactual reimbursement or the amount charged for the purchase of fuel wouldimpose unreasonable administrative burdens on the employer, the provisionof fuel may be valued under the rule provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B)of this section. (iii) <T3>Treatment of other services. </T3>The fair market value of any servicenot specifically identified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section thatis provided by the employer with respect to an automobile (other than theservices of a chauffeur) must be added to the Annual Lease Value of theautomobile in determining the fair market value of the benefit provided.See paragraph (b) (5) of this section for rules relating to the valuationof chauffeur services. (4) <T3>Availability of an automobile for less than an entire calendar year</T3>_(i)<T3>Pro-rated Annual Lease Value used for continuous availability of atleast 30 days</T3>_(A) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)of this section, for periods of continuous availability of at least 30days, but less than an entire calendar year, the value of the availabilityof an automobile provided by an employer electing to use the automobilelease valuation rule of this paragraph (d) is the pro-rated Annual LeaseValue. The pro-rated Annual Lease Value is calculated by multiplying theapplicable Annual Lease Value by a fraction, the numerator of which isthe number of days of availability and the denominator of which is 365.(B) <T3>Special rule for continuous availability of at least 30 days that straddlestwo reporting years. </T3>If an employee is provided with the continuousavailability of an automobile for at least 30 days, but the continuousperiod straddles two calendar years (or two special accounting periodsif the special accounting rule of Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B. 31,August 5, 1985) (relating to the reporting of and withholding on noncashfringe benefits) is used), the pro-rated Annual Lease Value, rather thanthe Daily Lease Value, may be applied with respect to such period of continuousavailability. (ii) <T3>Daily Lease Value used for continuous availability of less than 30days. </T3>Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of thissection, for periods of continuous availability of one or more but lessthan 30 days, the value of the availability of the employer-provided automobileis the Daily Lease Value. The Daily Lease Value is calculated by multiplyingthe applicable Annual Lease Value by a fraction, the numerator of whichis four times the number of days of availability and the denominator ofwhich is 365.(iii) <T3>Election to treat all periods as periods of at least 30 days.</T3>The value of the availability of an employer-provided automobile for aperiod of continuous availability of less than 30 days may be determinedby applying the pro-rated Annual Lease Value by treating the automobileas if it had been available for 30 days, if doing so would result in alower valuation than applying the Daily Lease Value to the shorter periodof actual availability. (iv) <T3>Periods of unavailability</T3>_(A) <T3>General rule.</T3> In general, a pro-rated Annual Lease Value (as providedin paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section) is used to value the availabilityof an employer-provided automobile when the automobile is available toan employee for a continuous period of at least 30 days but less than theentire calendar year. Neither an employer nor an employee, however, mayuse a pro-rated Annual Lease Value when the reduction of Federal taxesis the primary reason the automobile is unavailable to an employee at certaintimes during the calendar year. (B) <T3>Unavailability for personal reasons of the employee.</T3> If an automobileis unavailable to an employee because of personal reasons of the employee,such as while the employee is on vacation, a pro-rated Annual Lease Value,if used, must not take into account such periods of unavailability. Forexample, assume that an automobile is available to an employee during thefirst five months of the year and during the last five months of the year.Assume further that the period of unavailability occurs because the employeeis on vacation. The Annual Lease Value, if it is applied, must be appliedwith respect to the entire 12-month period. The Annual Lease Value maynot be pro-rated to take into account the two-month period of unavailability.(5) <T3>Fair market value</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> For purposes of determining the Annual Lease Valueof an automobile under the Annual Lease Value Table, the fair market valueof an automobile is the amount that an individual would have to pay inan arm's-length transaction to purchase the particular automobile in thejurisdiction in which the vehicle is purchased or leased. That amount includesall amounts attributable to the purchase of an automobile such as salestax and title fees as well as the purchase price of the automobile. Anyspecial relationship that may exist between the employee and the employermust be disregarded. Also, the employee's subjective perception of thevalue of the automobile is not relevant to the determination of the automobile'sfair market value, and, except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of thissection, the cost incurred by the employer in connection with the purchaseor lease of the automobile is not determinative of the fair market valueof the automobile. (ii) <T3>Safe-harbor valuation rule_</T3>(A) <T3>General rule.</T3> For purposes of calculating the Annual Lease Valueof an automobile under this paragraph (d), the safe-harbor value of theautomobile may be used as the fair market value of the automobile. (B) <T3>Automobiles owned by the employer.</T3> For an automobile owned bythe employer, the safe-harbor value of the automobile is the employer'scost of purchasing the automobile (including sales tax, title, and otherexpenses attributable to such purchase), provided the purchase is madeat arm's-length. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the safe-harborvalue of this paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) is not available with respect toan automobile manufactured by the employer. Thus, for example, if one entitymanufactures an automobile and sells it to an entity with which it is aggregatedpursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, this paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B)does not apply to value the automobile by the aggregated employer. In thiscase, value must be determined under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.(C) <T3>Automobiles leased by the employer</T3>. For an automobile leased butnot manufactured by the employer, the safe-harbor value of the automobileis either the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the automobile lesseight percent (including sales tax, title, and other expenses attributableto such purchase), or the value determined under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)of this section. (iii) <T3>Use of nationally recognized pricing sources.</T3> The fair marketvalue of an automobile that is_(A) Provided to an employee prior to January 1, 1985, (B) Being revalued pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2) (iv) or (v) of this section,or (C) A leased automobile being valued pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(ii) ofthis section, may be determined by reference to the retail value of suchautomobile as reported by a nationally recognized pricing source that regularlyreports new or used automobile retail values, whichever is applicable.That retail value must be reasonable with respect to the automobile beingvalued. Pricing sources consist of publications and electronic data bases.(iv) <T3>Fair market value of special equipment.</T3> When determining the fairmarket value of an automobile, the employer may exclude the fair marketvalue of any specialized equipment or telephone that is added to or carriedin the automobile provided that the presence of that equipment or telephoneis necessitated by, and attributable to, the business needs of the employer.The value of the specialized equipment must be included if the employeeto whom the automobile is available uses the specialized equipment in atrade or business of the employee other than the employee's trade or businessof being an employee of the employer. (v) <T3>Fleet-average valuation rule_</T3>(A) <T3>In general.</T3> An employer with a fleet of 20 or more automobilesmeeting the requirements of this paragraph (d)(5)(v) (including the business-useand fair market value conditions of paragraph (d)(5)(v)(D) of this section)may use a fleet-average value for purposes of calculating the Annual LeaseValues of the automobiles in the fleet. The fleet-average value is theaverage of the fair market values of all automobiles in the fleet. Thefair market value of each automobile in the fleet shall be determined,pursuant to the rules of paragraphs (d)(5) (i) through (iv) of this section,as of the date described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section. (B) <T3>Period for use of rule.</T3> The fleet-average valuation rule of thisparagraph (d)(5)(v) may be used by an employer as of January 1 of any calendaryear following the calendar year in which the employer acquires a sufficientnumber of automobiles to total a fleet of 20 or more automobiles. The AnnualLease Value calculated for the automobiles in the fleet, based on the fleet-averagevalue, shall remain in effect for the period that begins with the firstJanuary 1 the fleet-average valuation ru1e of this paragraph (d)(5)(v)is applied by the employer to the automobiles in the fleet and ends onDecember 31 of the subsequent calendar year. The Annual Lease Value foreach subsequent two-year period is calculated by determining the fleet-averagevalue of the automobiles in the fleet as of the first January 1 of suchperiod. An employer may cease using the fleet-average valuation rule asof any January 1. If, however, the employer is using the special accountingrule provided in Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B. 31, August 5, 1985)(relating to the reporting of and withholding on noncash fringe benefits),the employer may apply the rules of this paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) on thebasis of the special accounting period rather than the calendar year. (Thisis accomplished by substituting (<T3>1</T3>) the beginning of the special accounting period that beginsimmediately prior to the January 1 described in this paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B)for January 1 wherever it appears in this paragraph (d)(5)(v) (B) and (<T3>2</T3>) the end of such accounting period for December 31.) If thenumber of qualifying automobiles in the employer's fleet declines to fewerthan 20 for more than 50 percent of the days in a year, then the fleet-averagevaluation rule does not apply as of January 1 of such year. In this case,the Annual Lease Value must be determined separately for each remainingautomobile. The revaluation rules of paragraph (d)(2) (iv) and (v) of thissection do not apply to automobiles valued under this paragraph (d)(5)(v).(C) <T3>Automobiles included in the fleet.</T3> An employer may include ina fleet any automobile that meets the requirements of this paragraph (d)(5)(v)and is available to any employee of the employer for personal use. An employermay include in the fleet only automobiles the availability of which isvalued under the automobile lease valuation rule of this paragraph (d).An employer need not include in the fleet all automobiles valued underthe automobile lease valuation rule. An employer may have more than onefleet for purposes of the fleet-average rule of this paragraph (d)(5)(v).For example, an employer may group automobiles in a fleet according totheir physical type or use. (D) <T3>Limitations on use of fleet-average rule.</T3> The rule provided inthis paragraph (d)(5)(v) may not be used for any automobile the fair marketvalue of which (determined pursuant to paragraphs (d)(5) (i) through (iv)of this section as of either the first date on which the automobile ismade available to any employee of the employer for personal use or, iflater, January 1, 1985) exceeds $16,500. The fair market value limitationof $16,500 shall be adjusted pursuant to section 280F(d)(7) of the InternalRevenue Code of 1986. The first such adjustment shall be for calendar year1989 (substitute October 1986 for October 1987 in applying the formula).In addition, the rule provided in this paragraph (d)(5)(v) may only beused for automobiles that the employer reasonably expects will regularlybe used in the employer's trade or business. For rules concerning whenan automobile is regularly used in the employer's business, see paragraph(e)(1)(iv) of this section. (E) <T3>Additional automobiles added to the fleet.</T3> The fleet-average valuein effect at the time an automobile is added to a fleet is treated as thefair market value of the additional automobile for purposes of determiningthe Annual Lease Value of the automobile until the fleet-average valuechanges pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section. (F) <T3>Use of the fleet-average rule by employees.</T3> An employee may onlyuse the fleet-average rule if it is used by the employer. If an employeruses the fleet-average rule, and the employee uses the special valuationrule of paragraph (d) of this section, the employee must use the fleet-averagevalue determined by the employer. (6) <T3>Special rules for continuous availability of certain automobiles</T3>_(i)<T3>Fleet automobiles.</T3> If an employer is using the fleet-average valuationru1e of paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section and the employer provides anemployee with the continuous availability of an automobile from the samefleet during a period (though not necessarily the same fleet automobilefor the entire period), the employee is treated as having the use of asingle fleet automobile for the entire period, e.g., an entire calendaryear. Thus, when applying the automobile lease valuation rule of this paragraph(d), the employer may treat the fleet-average value as the fair marketvalue of the automobile deemed available to the  employee for the periodfor purposes of calculating the Annual Lease Value, (or pro-rated AnnualLease Value or Daily Lease Value whichever is applicable) of the automobile.If an employer provides an employee with the continuous availability ofmore than  one fleet automobile during a period, the employer may treatthe fleet-average value as the fair market value of each automobile providedto the employee provided that the rules of paragraph (d)(5)(v)(D) of thissection are satisfied. (ii) <T3>Demonstration automobiles</T3>_(A) <T3>In general.</T3> If an automobile dealership provides an employee withthe continuous availability of a demonstration automobile (as defined inandSection; 1.132-5(o)(3)) during a period (though not necessarily the samedemonstration automobile for the entire period), the employee is treatedas having the use of a single demonstration automobile for  the entireperiod, e.g., an entire calendar year. If an employer provides an employeewith the continuous availability of more than one demonstration automobileduring a period, the employer may treat the value determined under paragraph(d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section as the fair market value of each automobileprovided to the employee. For rules relating to the treatment as a workingcondition fringe of the qualified automobile demonstration use of a demonstrationautomobile by a full-time automobile salesman, see andSection; 1.132-5(o).(B) <T3>Determining the fair market value of a demonstration automobile.</T3>When applying the automobile lease valuation rule of this paragraph (d),the employer may treat the average of the fair market values of the demonstrationautomobiles which are available to an employee and held in the dealership'sinventory during the calendar year as the fair market value of the demonstrationautomobile deemed available to the employee for the period for purposesof calculating the Annual Lease Value of the automobile. If under the factsand circumstances it is inappropriate to take into account, with respectto an employee, certain models of demonstration automobiles, the valueof the benefit is determined without reference to the fair market valuesof such models. For example, assume that an employee has the continuousavailability for an entire calendar year of one demonstration automobile,although not the same one for the entire year. Assume further that thefair market values of the automobiles in the dealership inventory duringthe year range from $8,000 to $20,000. If there is not a substantial period(such as three months) during the year when the employee uses demonstrationautomobiles valued at less than $16,000, then those automobiles are notconsidered in determining the value of the benefit provided to the employee.In this case, the average of the fair market values of the demonstrationautomobiles in the dealership's inventory valued at $16,000 or more istreated as the fair market value of the automobile deemed available tothe employee for the calendar year for purposes of calculating the AnnualLease Value of the automobile. (7) <T3>Consistency rules</T3>_(i) <T3>Use of the automobile lease valuation rule by an employer.</T3> Exceptas provided in paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section, an employer mayadopt the automobile lease valuation rule of this paragraph (d) for anautomobile only if the rule is adopted to take effect by the later  of_(A) January 1, 1989, or (B) The first day on which the automobile is made available  to an employeeof the employer for personal use (or, if the commuting valuation rule ofparagraph (f) of this section is used when the automobile is first madeavailable to an employee of the employer for personal use, the first dayon which the commuting valuation rule is not used). (ii) <T3>An employer must use the automobile lease valuation rule for all subsequentyears.</T3> Once the automobile lease valuation rule has been adopted foran automobile by an employer, the rule must be used by the employer forall subsequent years in which the employer makes the automobile availableto any employee except that the employer may, for any year during which(or for any employee for whom) use of the automobile qualifies for thecommuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section, use the commutingvaluation rule with respect to the automobile. (iii) <T3>Use of the automobile lease valuation rule by an employee.</T3> Anemployee may adopt the automobile lease valuation rule for an automobileonly if the rule is adopted_(A) By the employer, and (B) Beginning with the first day on which the automobile for which theemployer (consistent with paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section) adoptedthe rule is made available to that employee for personal use (or, if thecommuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section is used whenthe automobile is first made available to that employee for personal use,the first day on which the commuting valuation rule is not used). (iv) <T3>An employee must use the automobile lease valuation rule for all subsequentyears.</T3> Once the automobile lease valuation rule has been adopted foran automobile by an employee, the rule must be used by the employee forall subsequent years in which the automobile for which the rule is usedis available to the employee. However, the employee may, for any year duringwhich use of the automobile qualifies for use of the commuting valuationrule of paragraph (f) of this section and for which the employer uses suchrule, use the commuting valuation rule with respect to the automobile.(v) <T3>Replacement automobiles.</T3> Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph(d)(7) to the contrary, if the automobile lease valuation rule is usedby an employer, or by an employer and an employee, with respect to a particularautomobile, and a replacement automobile is provided to the employee forthe primary purpose of reducing Federal taxes, then the employer, or theemployer and the employee, using the rule must continue to use the rulewith respect to the replacement automobile. (e) <T3>Vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule_</T3>(1) <T3>In general_</T3>(i) <T3>General rule.</T3> Under the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation ruleof this paragraph (e), if an employer provides an employee with the useof a vehicle that_(A) The employer reasonably expects will be regularly used in the employer'strade or business throughout the calendar year (or such shorter periodas the vehicle may be owned or leased by the employer), or (B) Satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section,the value of the benefit provided in the calendar year is the standardmileage rate provided in the applicable Revenue Ruling or Revenue Procedure(``cents-per-mile rate'') multiplied by the total number of miles the vehicleis driven by the employee for personal purposes. The cents-per-mile rateis to be applied prospectively from the first day of the taxable year followingthe date of publication of the applicable Revenue Ruling or Revenue Procedure.An employee who uses an employer-provided vehicle, in whole or in part,for a trade or business other than the employer's trade or business, maytake a deduction for such business use based upon the vehicle cents-per-milerule as long as such deduction is at the same standard mileage rate asthat used in calculating the employee's income inclusion. The standardmileage rate must be applied to personal miles independent of businessmiles. Thus, for example, if the standard mileage rate were 24 cents permile for the first 15,000 miles and 11 cents per mile for all miles over15,000 and an employee drives 20,000 personal miles and 45,000 businessmiles in a year, the value of the personal use of the vehicle is $4,150((15,000andmultiply;$.24)+(5,000andmultiply;$.11)). For purposes of this section,the use of a vehicle for personal purposes is any use of the vehicle otherthan use in the employee's trade or business of being an employee of theemployer. (ii) <T3>Mileage rule.</T3> A vehicle satisfies the requirements of this paragraph(e)(1)(ii) for a calendar year if_(A) It is actually driven at least 10,000 miles in that year; and(B) Use of the vehicle during the year is primarily by employees. For example,if a vehicle is used by only one employee during the calendar year andthat employee drives the vehicle at least 10,000 miles during the year,the vehicle satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) evenif all miles driven by the employee are personal. A vehicle is consideredused during the year primarily by employees in accordance with the requirementof paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section if employees use the vehicleon a consistent basis for commuting. If the employer does not own or leasethe vehicle during a portion of the year, the 10,000 mile threshold isto be reduced proportionately to reflect the periods when the employerdid not own or lease the vehicle. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii),use of the vehicle by an individual (other than the employee) whose usewould be taxed to the employee is not considered use by the employee. (iii) <T3>Limitation on use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule_</T3>(A)<T3>In general.</T3> Except as otherwise provided in the last sentenceof this paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A), the value of the use of an automobile(as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section) may not be determinedunder the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule of this paragraph (e) fora calendar year if the fair market value of the automobile (determinedpursuant to paragraphs (d)(5) (i) through (iv) of this section as of thelater of January 1, 1985, or the first date on which the automobile ismade available to any employee of the employer for personal use) exceedsthe sum of the maximum recovery deductions allowable under section 280F(a)(2)for a five-year period for an automobile first placed in service duringthat calendar year (whether or not the automobile is actually placed inservice during that year) as adjusted by section 280F(d)(7). With respectto a vehicle placed in service prior to January 1, 1989, the limitationon value will be not less than $12,800. With respect to a vehicle placedin service in or after 1989, the limitation on value is $12,800 as adjustedby section 280F(d)(7). (B) <T3>Application of limitation with respect to a vehicle owned by both anemployer and an employee.</T3> If an employee contributes an amount towardsthe purchase price of a vehicle in return for a percentage ownership interestin the vehicle, for purposes of determining whether the limitation of thisparagraph (e)(1)(iii) applies, the fair market value of the vehicle isreduced by the lesser of_ (<T3>1</T3>) The amount contributed, or (<T3>2</T3>) An amount equal to the employee's percentage ownership interestmultiplied by the unreduced fair market value of the vehicle. If the employeedoes not receive an ownership interest in the employer-provided vehicle,then the fair market value of the vehicle is determined without regardto any amount contributed. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(B),an employee's ownership interest in a vehicle will not be recognized unlessit is reflected in the title of the vehicle. An ownership interest reflectedin the title of a vehicle will not be recognized if under the facts andcircumstances the title does not reflect the benefits and burdens of ownership.(C) <T3>Application of limitation with respect to a vehicle leased by bothan employer and employee.</T3> If an employee contributes an amount towardthe cost to lease a vehicle in return for a percentage interest in thevehicle lease, for purposes of determining whether the limitation of thisparagraph (e)(1)(iii) applies, the fair market value of the vehicle isreduced by the amount specified in the following sentence. The amount specifiedin this sentence is the unreduced fair market value of a vehicle multipliedby the lesser of_ (<T3>1</T3>) The employee's percentage interest in the lease, or (<T3>2</T3>) A fraction, the numerator of which is the amount contributedand the denominator of which is the entire lease cost. If the employeedoes not receive an interest in the vehicle lease, then the fair marketvalue is determined without regard to any amount contributed. For purposesof this paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(C), an employee's interest in a vehicle leasewill not be recognized unless the employee is a named co-lessee on thelease. An interest in a lease will not be recognized if under the factsand circumstances, the lease does not reflect the true obligations of thelessees. (iv) <T3>Regular use in an employer's trade or business.</T3> Whether a vehicleis regularly used in an employer's trade or business is determined on thebasis of all facts and circumstances. A vehicle is considered regularlyused in an employer's trade or business for purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A)of this section if one of the following safe harbor conditions is satisfied:(A) At least 50 percent of the vehicle's total annual mileage is for theemployer's business; or (B) The vehicle is generally used each workday to transport at least threeemployees of the employer to and from work in an employer-sponsored commutingvehicle pool. Infrequent business use of the vehicle, such as for occasionaltrips to the airport or between the employer's multiple business premises,does not constitute regular use of the vehicle in the employer's tradeor business. (v) <T3>Application of rule to shared usage.</T3> If an employer regularlyprovides a vehicle to employees for use by more than one employee at thesame time, such as with an employer-sponsored vehicle commuting pool, theemployer may use the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule to value theuse of the vehicle by each employee who shares such use. See andSection;1.61-21(c)(2)(ii)(B) for provisions relating to the allocation of the valueof an automobile to more than one employee. (2) <T3>Definition of vehicle.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (e), theterm ``vehicle'' means any motorized wheeled vehicle manufactured primarilyfor use on public streets, roads, and highways. The term ``vehicle'' includesan automobile as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. (3) <T3>Services included in, or excluded from, the cents-per-mile rate_</T3>(i)<T3>Maintenance and insurance included.</T3> The cents-per-mile rate includesthe fair market value of maintenance of, and insurance for, the vehicle.The cents-per-mile rate may not be reduced by the fair market value ofany service included in the cents-per-mile rate but not provided by theemployer. An employer or employee who wishes to take into account onlythe particular services provided with respect to a vehicle may value theavailability of the vehicle under the general valuation rules of paragraph(b) of this section. (ii) <T3>Fuel provided by the employer_</T3>(A) <T3>Miles driven in the United States, Canada, or Mexico.</T3> With respectto miles driven in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, the cents-per-milerate includes the fair market value of fuel provided by the employer. Iffuel is not provided by the employer, the cents-per-mile rate may be reducedby no more than 5.5 cents or the amount specified in any applicable RevenueRuling or Revenue Procedure. For purposes of this section, the United Statesincludes the United States, its possessions and its territories. (B) <T3>Miles driven outside the United States, Canada, or Mexico.</T3> Withrespect to miles driven outside the United States, Canada, or Mexico, thefair market value of fuel provided by the employer is not reflected inthe cents-per-mile rate. Accordingly, the cents-per-mile rate may be reducedbut by no more than 5.5 cents or the amount specified in any applicableRevenue Ruling or Revenue Procedure. If the employer provides the fuelin kind, it must be valued based on all the facts and circumstances Ifthe employer reimburses the employee for the cost of fuel or allows theemployee to charge the employer for the cost of fuel, the fair market valueof the fuel is generally the amount of the actual reimbursement or theamount charged, provided the purchase of fuel is at arm's length. (iii) <T3>Treatment of other services. </T3>The fair market value of any servicenot specifically identified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section thatis provided by the employer with respect to a vehicle is not reflectedin the cents-per-mile rate. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for rulesrelating to valuation of chauffeur services. (4) <T3>Valuation of personal use only. </T3>The vehicle cents-per-mile valuationrule of this paragraph (e) may only be used to value the miles driven forpersonal purposes. Thus, the employer must include an amount in an employee'sincome with respect to the use of a vehicle that is equal to the productof the number of personal miles driven by the employee and the appropriatecents-per-mile rate. The term ``personal miles'' means all miles for whichthe employee used the automobile except miles driven in the employee'strade or business of being an employee of the employer. Unless additionalservices are provided with respect to the vehicle (see paragraph (e)(3)(iii)of this section), the employer may not include in income a greater amount;for example, the employer may not include in income 100 percent (all businessand personal miles) of the value of the use of the vehicle. (5) <T3>Consistency rules</T3>_(i) <T3>Use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule by an employer. </T3>Anemployer must adopt the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule of this paragraph(e) for a vehicle to take effect by the later of_(A) January 1, 1989, or (B) The first day on which the vehicle is used by an employee of the employerfor personal use (or, if the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f)of this section is used when the vehicle is first used by an employee ofthe employer for personal use, the first day on which the commuting valuationrule is not used). (ii) <T3>An employer must use the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule forall subsequent years. </T3>Once the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rulehas been adopted for a vehicle by an employer, the rule must be used bythe employer for all subsequent years in which the vehicle qualifies foruse of the rule, except that the employer may, for any year during whichuse of the vehicle qualifies for the commuting valuation rule of paragraph(f) of this section, use the commuting valuation rule with respect to thevehicle. If the vehicle fails to qualify for use of the vehicle cents-per-milevaluation rule during a subsequent year, the employer may adopt for suchsubsequent year and thereafter any other special valuation rule for whichthe vehicle then qualifies. If the employer elects to use the automobilelease valuation rule of paragraph (d) of this section for a period in whichthe automobile does not qualify for use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuationrule, then the employer must comply with the requirements of paragraph(d)(7) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (d)(7) of this section,the first day on which the automobile with respect to which the vehiclecents-per-mile rule had been used fails to qualify for use of the vehiclecents-per-mile valuation rule may be deemed to be the first day on whichthe automobile is available to an employee of the employer for personaluse. (iii) <T3>Use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule by an employee. </T3>Anemployee may adopt the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule for a vehicleonly if the rule is adopted_(A) By the employer, and (B) Beginning with respect to the first day on which the vehicle for whichthe employer (consistent with paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section) adoptedthe rule is available to that employee for personal use (or, if the commutingvaluation rule of paragraph (f) of this section is used when the vehicleis first used by an employee for personal use, the first day on which thecommuting valuation rule is not used). (iv) <T3>An employee must use the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule forall subsequent years. </T3>Once the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rulehas been adopted for a vehicle by an employee, the rule must be used bythe employee for all subsequent years of personal use of the vehicle bythe employee for which the rule is used by the employer. However, see paragraph(f) of this section for rules relating to the use of the commuting valuationrule for a subsequent year. (v) <T3>Replacement vehicles. </T3>Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph(e)(5) to the contrary, if the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule isused by an employer, or by an employer and an employee, with respect toa particular vehicle. and a replacement vehicle is provided to the employeefor the primary purpose of reducing Federal taxes, then the employer, orthe employer and the employee, using the rule must continue to use therule with respect to the replacement vehicle if the replacement vehiclequalifies for use of the rule. (f) <T3>Commuting valuation rule</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Under the commuting valuation rule of this paragraph(f), the value of the commuting use of an employer-provided vehicle maybe determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section if the followingcriteria are met by the employer and employees with respect to the vehicle:(i) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided to oneor more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade or businessand is used in the employer's trade or business; (ii) For bona fide noncompensatory business reasons, the employer requiresthe employee to commute to and/or from work in the vehicle; (iii) The employer has established a written policy under which neitherthe employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee,may use the vehicle for personal purposes, other than for commuting orde minimis personal use (such as a stop for a personal errand on the waybetween a business delivery and the employee's home); (iv) Except for de minimis personal use, the employee does not use thevehicle for any personal purpose other than commuting; and (v) The employee required to use the vehicle for commuting is not a controlemployee of the employer (as defined in paragraphs (f) (5) and (6) of thissection). Personal use of a vehicle is all use of the vehicle by an employee thatis not used in the employee's trade or business of being an employee ofthe employer. An employer-provided vehicle that is generally used eachworkday to transport at least three employees of the employer to and fromwork in an employer-sponsored commuting vehicle pool is deemed to meetthe requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. (2) <T3>Special rules. </T3>Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (f)(1) ofthis section to the contrary, the following special rules apply_(i) <T3>Chauffeur-driven vehicles. </T3>If a vehicle is chauffeur-driven, thecommuting valuation rule of this paragraph (f) may not be used to valuethe commuting use of any person (other than the chauffeur) who rides inthe vehicle. (See paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for other vehiclespecial valuation rules.) The special rule of this paragraph (f) may beused to value the commuting-only use of the vehicle by the chauffeur ifthe conditions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section are satisfied. For purposesof this paragraph (f)(2), an individual will not be considered a chauffeurif he or she performs non-driving services for the employer, is not availableto perform driving services while performing such other services and whoseonly driving services consist of driving a vehicle used for commuting byother employees of the employer.(ii) <T3>Control employee exception. </T3>If the vehicle in which the employeeis required to commute is not an automobile as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)of this section, the restriction of paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section(relating to control employees) does not apply. (3) <T3>Commuting value</T3>_(i) <T3>$1.50 per one-way commute. </T3>If the requirements of this paragraph(f) are satisfied, the value of the commuting use of an employer-providedvehicle is $1.50 per one-way commute (e.g., from home to work or from workto home). The value provided in this paragraph (f)(3) includes the valueof any goods or services directly related to the vehicle (e.g., fuel).(ii) <T3>Value per employee. </T3>If there is more than one employee who commutesin the vehicle, such as in the case of an employer-sponsored commutingvehicle pool, the amount includible in the income of each employee is $1.50per one-way commute. Thus, the amount includible for each round-trip commuteis $3.00 per employee. See paragraphs (d)(7)(vi) and (e)(5)(vi) of thissection for use of the automobile lease valuation and vehicle cents-per-milevaluation special rules for valuing the use or availability of the vehiclein the case of an employer-sponsored vehicle or automobile commuting pool.(4) <T3>Definition of vehicle. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph (f), theterm ``vehicle'' means any motorized wheeled vehicle manufactured primarilyfor use on public streets, roads, and highways. The term ``vehicle'' includesan automobile as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. (5) <T3>Control employee defined_Non-government employer. </T3>For purposesof this paragraph (f), a control employee of a non-government employeris any employee_ (i) Who is a Board- or shareholder-appointed, confirmed, or elected officerof the employer whose compensation equals or exceeds $50,000, (ii) Who is a director of the employer, (iii) Whose compensation equals or exceeds $100,000, or (iv) Who owns a one-percent or greater equity, capital, or profits interestin the employer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of determining who is a one-percent owner under paragraph(f)(5)(iv) of this section, any individual who owns (or is considered asowning under section 318(a) or principles similar to section 318(a) forentities other than corporations) one percent or more of the fair marketvalue of an entity (the ``owned entity'') is considered a one-percent ownerof all entities which would be aggregated with the owned entity under therules of section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o). For purposes of determiningwho is an officer or director with respect to an employer under this paragraph(f)(5), notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if anentity would be aggregated with other entities under the rules of section414 (b), (c), (m), or (o), the officer definition (but not the compensationrequirement) and the director definition apply to each such separate entityrather tha to the aggregated employer. An employee who is an officer ora director of an entity (the ``first entity'') shall be treated as an officeror a director of all entities aggregated with the first entity under therules of section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o). Instead of applying the controlemployee definition of this paragraph (f)(5), an employer may treat all,and only, employees who are ``highly compensated'' employees (as definedin andSection; 1.132-8(g)) as control employees for purposes of this paragraph(f). (6) <T3>Control employee defined_Government employer. </T3>For purposes ofthis paragraph (f), a control employee of a government employer is any_(i) Elected official, or (ii) Employee whose compensation equals or exceeds the compensation paidto a Federal Government employee holding a position at Executive LevelV, determined under Chapter 11 of title 2, United States Code, as adjustedby section 5318 of Title 5 United States Code.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of this paragraph (f), the term ``government'' includesany Federal, state or local governmental unit, and any agency or instrumentalitythereof. Instead of applying the control employee definition of paragraph(f)(6), an employer may treat all and only employees who are ``highly compensated''employees (as defined in andSection; 1.132-8(f)) as control employees forpurposes of this paragraph (f). (7) <T3>``Compensation'' defined. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph (f),the term ``compensation'' has the same meaning as in section 414(q)(7).Compensation includes all amounts received from all entities treated asa single employer under section 414 (b), (c) (m), or (o). Levels of compensationshall be adjusted at the sam time and in the same manner as provided insection 415(d). The first such adjustment shall be for calendar year 1988.(g) <T3>Non-commercial flight valuation rule</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Under the non-commercial flight valuation rule ofthis paragraph (g), except as provided in paragraph (g)(12) of this section,if an employee is provided with a flight on an employer-provided aircraft,the value of the flight is calculated using the aircraft valuation formulaof paragraph (g)(5) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (g),the value of a flight on an employer-provided aircraft by an individualwho is less than two years old is deemed to be zero. See paragraph (b)(1)of this section for rules relating to the amount includible in income whenan employee reimburses the employee's employer for all or part of the fairmarket value of the benefit provided. (2) <T3>Eligible flights and eligible aircraft. </T3>The valuation rule ofthis paragraph (g) may be used to value flights on all employer-providedaircraft, including helicopters. The valuation rule of this paragraph (g)may be used to value international as well as domestic flights. The valuationrule of this paragraph (g) may not be used to value a flight on any commercialaircraft on which air transportation is sold to the public on a per-seatbasis. For a special valuation rule relating to certain flights on commercialaircraft, see paragraph (h) of this section. (3) <T3>Definition of a flight</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(3)(iii)of this section (relating to intermediate stops), for purposes of thisparagraph (g), a flight is the distance (in statute miles, i.e., 5,280feet per statute mile) between the place at which the individual boardsthe aircraft and the place at which the individual deplanes. (ii) <T3>Valuation of each flight. </T3>Under the valuation rule of this paragraph(g), value is determined separately for each flight. Thus, a round-tripis comprised of at least two flights. For example, an employee who takesa personal trip on an employer-provided aircraft from New York City toDenver, then Denver to Los Angeles, and finally Los Angeles to New YorkCity has taken three flights and must apply the aircraft valuation formulaseparately to each flight. The value of a flight must be determined ona passenger-by-passenger basis. For example, if an individual accompaniesan employee and the flight taken by the individual would be taxed to theemployee, the employee would be taxed on the special rule value of theflight by the employee and the flight by the individual. (iii) <T3>Intermediate stop. </T3>If a landing is necessitated by weather conditions,by an emergency, for purposes of refueling or obtaining other servicesrelating to the aircraft or for any other purpose unrelated to the personalpurposes of the employee whose flight is being valued, that landing isan intermediate stop. Additional mileage attributable to an intermediatestop is not considered when determining the distance of an employee's flight.(iv) <T3>Examples. </T3>The rules of paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section maybe illustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Assume that an employee's trip originates in St.Louis, Missouri, with Seattle, Washington as its destination, but, becauseof weather conditions, the aircraft lands in Denver, Colorado, and theemployee stays in Denver overnight. Assume further that the next day theaircraft flies to Seattle where the employee deplanes. The employee's flightis the distance between the airport in St. Louis and the airport in Seattle.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume that a trip originates in New York, New York,with five passengers and that the aircraft makes a stop in Chicago, Illinois,so that one of the passengers can deplane for a purpose unrelated to thepersonal purposes of the other passengers whose flights are being valued.The aircraft then goes on to Los Angeles, California, where the other fourpassengers will deplane. The flight of the passenger who deplaned in Chicagois the distance between the airport in New York and the airport in Chicago.The stop in Chicago is disregarded as an intermediate stop, however, whenmeasuring the flights taken by each of the other four passengers. Theirflights would be the distance between the airport in New York and the airportin Los Angeles.</ITAG>(4) <T3>Personal and non-personal flights_</T3>(i) In <T3>general. </T3>The valuation rule of this paragraph (g) applies to personalflights on employer-provided aircraft. A personal flight is one the valueof which is not excludable under another section of subtitle A of the InternalRevenue Code of 1986, such as under section 132(d) (relating to a workingcondition fringe). However, solely for purposes of paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)and (g)(4)(iii) of this section, references to personal flights do notinclude flights a portion of which would not be excludable from incomeby reason of section 274(c). (ii) <T3>Trip primarily for employer's business. </T3>If an employee combines,in one trip, personal and business flights on an employer-provided aircraftand the employee's trip is primarily for the employer's business (see andSection;1.162-2(b)(2)), the employee must include in income the excess of the valueof all the flights that comprise the trip over the value of the flightsthat would have been taken had there been no personal flights but onlybusiness flights. For example, assume that an employee flies on an employer-providedaircraft from Chicago, Illinois, to Miami, Florida, for the employer'sbusiness and that from Miami the employee flies on the employer-providedaircraft to Orlando, Florida, for personal purposes and then flies backto Chicago. Assume further that the primary purpose of the trip is forthe employer's business. The amount includible in income is the excessof the value of the three flights (Chicago to Miami, Miami to Orlando,and Orlando to Chicago), over the value of the flights that would havebeen taken had there been no personal flights but only business flights(Chicago to Miami and Miami to Chicago). (iii) <T3>Primarily personal trip. </T3>If an employee combines, in one trip,personal and business flights on an employer-provided aircraft and theemployee's trip is primarily personal (see andSection; 1.162-2(b)(2)), theamount includible in the employee's income is the value of the personalflights that would have been taken had there been no business flights butonly personal flights. For example, assume that an employee flies on anemployer-provided aircraft from San Francisco, California, to Los Angeles,California, for the employer's business and that from Los Angeles the employeeflies on an employer-provided aircraft to Palm Springs, California, primarilyfor personal reasons and then flies back to San Francisco. Assume furtherthat the primary purpose of the trip is personal. The amount includiblein the employee's income is the value of personal flights that would havebeen taken had there been no business flights but only personal flights(San Francisco to Palm Springs and Palm Springs to San Francisco). (iv) <T3>Application of section 274(c). </T3>The value of employer- providedtravel outside the United States away from home may not be excluded fromthe employee's gross income as a working condition fringe, by either theemployer or the employee, to the extent not deductible by reason of section274(c). The valuation rule of this paragraph (g) applies to that portionof the value any flight not excludable by reason of section 274(c). Suchvalue is includible in income in addition to the amounts determined underparagraphs (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) of this section. (v) <T3>Flights by individuals who are not personal guests. </T3>If an individualwho is not an employee of the employer providing the aircraft is on a flight,and the individual is not the personal guest of any employee of the employer,the flight by the individual is not taxable to any employee of the employerproviding the aircraft. The rule in the preceding sentence applies wherethe individual is provided the flight by the employer for noncompensatorybusiness reasons of the employer. For example, assume that G, an employeeof company Y, accompanies A, an employee of company X, on company X's aircraftfor the purpose of inspecting land under consideration for purchase bycompany X from company Y. The flight by G is not taxable to A. No inferencemay be drawn from this paragraph (g)(4)(v) concerning the taxation of aflight provided to an individual who is neither an employee of the employernor a personal guest of any employee of the employer. (5) <T3>Aircraft valuation formula. </T3>Under the valuation rule of this paragraph(g), the value of a flight is determined under the base aircraft valuationformula (also known as the Standard Industry Fare Level formula or SIFL)by multiplying the SIFL cents-per-mile rates applicable for the periodduring which the flight was taken by the appropriate aircraft multiple(as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section) and then adding the applicableterminal charge. The SIFL cents-per-mile rates in the formula and the terminalcharge are calculated by the Department of Transportation and are revisedsemi-annually. The base aircraft valuation formula in effect from January1, 1989 through June 30, 1989, is as follows: a terminal charge of $26.48plus ($.1449 per mile for the first 500 miles, $.1105 per mile for milesbetween 501 and 1500, and $.1062 per mile for miles over 1500). For example,if a flight taken on January 15, 1989, by a non-control employee on anemployer-provided aircraft with a maximum certified takeoff weight of 26,000lbs. is 2,000 miles long, the value of the flight determined under thisparagraph (g)(5) is: $100.36 ((.313andmultiply;(($.1449andmultiply;500)+($.1105andmultiply;1,000)+($.1062andmultiply;500)))+$26.48). The aircraft valuation formula appliesseparately to each flight being valued under this paragraph (g). Therefore,the number of miles an employee has flown on employer-provided aircraftflights prior to the flight being valued does not affect the determinationof the value of the flight. (6) <T3>Discretion to provide new formula. </T3>The Commissioner may prescribea different base aircraft valuation formula by regulation, Revenue Rulingor Revenue Procedure in the event that the calculation of the StandardIndustry Fare Level is discontinued. (7) <T3>Aircraft multiples_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>The aircraft multiples are based on the maximum certifiedtakeoff weight of the aircraft. When applying the aircraft valuation formulato a flight, the appropriate aircraft multiple is multiplied by the productof the applicable SIFL cents-per-mile rates multiplied by the number ofmiles in the flight and then the terminal charge is added to the product.For purposes of applying the aircraft valuation formula described in paragraph(g)(5) of this section, the aircraft multiples are as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,8.1,10 </C>  <H1>Maximum certified take-off weight of the aircraft</H1><H1>Aircraft multiple for a control employee (percent)</H1><H1>Aircraft multiple for a non-control employee (percent)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">6,000 lbs. or less <D>62.5 </D><D>15.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6,001-10,000 lbs. <D>125 </D><D>23.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,001-25,000 lbs. <D>300 </D><D>31.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25,001 lbs. or more <D>400 </D><D>31.3</D></ITAG></ITAG>(ii) <T3>Flights treated as provided to a control employee.</T3> Except as providedin paragraph (g)(12) of this section, any fIight provided to an individualwhose flight would be taxable to a control employee (as defined in paragraphs(g) (8) and (9) of this section) as the recipient shall be valued as ifsuch flight had been provided to that control employee. For example, assumethat the chief executive officer of an employer, his spouse, and his twochildren fly on an employer-provided aircraft for personal purposes. Assumefurther that the maximum certified takeoff weight of the aircraft is 12,000lbs. The amount includible in the employee's income is 4andmultiply;((300percentandmultiply;the applicable SIFL cents-per-mile rates provided in paragraph(g)(5) of this section multiplied by the number of miles in the flight)plus the applicable terminal charge). (8) <T3>Control employee defined</T3>_<T3>Non-government employer</T3>_(i) <T3>Definition.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (g), a control employeeof a non-government employer is any employee_(<T3>A</T3>) Who is a Board- or shareholder-appointed, confirmed, or electedofficer of the employer, limited to the lesser of_(<T3>1</T3>) One percent of all employees (increased to the next highestinteger, if not an integer) or (<T3>2</T3>) Ten employees; (B) Who is among the top one percent most highly-paid employees of theemployer (increased to the next highest integer, if not an integer) limitedto a maximum of 50; (C) Who owns a five-percent or greater equity, capital, or profits interestin the employer; or (D) Who is a director of the employer. (ii) <T3>Special rules for control employee definition</T3>_(A) <T3>In general.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (g), any employee whois a family member (within the meaning of section 267(c)(4)) of a controlemployee is also a control employee. For purposes of paragraph (g)(8)(i)(B)of this section, the term ``employee'' does not include any individualunless such individual is a common-law employee, partner, or one-percentor greater shareholder of the employer. Pursuant to this paragraph (g)(8),an employee may be a control employee under more than one of the requirementslisted in paragraphs (g)(8)(i) (A) through (D) of this section. For example,an employee may be both an officer under paragraph (g)(8)(i)(A) of thissection and a highly-paid employee under paragraph (g)(8)(i)(B) of thissection. In this case, for purposes of the officer limitation rule of paragraph(g)(8)(i)(A) of this section and the highly-paid employee limitation ruleof paragraph (g)(8)(i)(B) of this section, the employee would be countedin applying both limitations. For purposes of determining the one-percentlimitation under paragraphs (g)(8)(i) (A) and (B) of this section, an employershall exclude from consideration employees described in andSection; 1.132-8(b)(3).Instead of applying the control employee definition of this paragraph (g)(8),an employer may treat all (and only) employees who are ``highly compensated''employees (as defined in andSection; 1.132-8(f)) as control employees forpurposes of this paragraph (g). (B) <T3>Special rules for officers, owners, and highly-paid control employees.</T3>In no event shall an employee whose compensation is less than $50,000 bea control employee under paragraph (g)(8)(i) (A) or (B) of this section.For purposes of determining who is a five-percent (or one-percent) ownerunder this paragraph (g)(8), any individual who owns (or is consideredas owning under section 318(a) or principles similar to section 318(a)for entities other than corporations) five percent (or one-percent) ormore of the fair market value of an entity (the ``owned entity'') is considereda five-percent (or one-percent) owner of all entities which would be aggregatedwith the owned entity under the rules of section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o).For purposes of determining who is an officer or director with respectto an employer under this paragraph (g)(8), notwithstanding anything inthis section to the contrary, if the employer would be aggregated withother employers under the rules of section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o), theofficer definition and the limitations and the director definition areapplied to each such separate employer rather than to the aggregated employer.An employee who is an officer or director of one employer (the ``firstemployer'') shall not be counted as an officer or a director of any otheremployer aggregated with the first employer under the rules of section414 (b), (c), or (m). If applicable, the officer limitations rule of paragraph(g)(8)(i)(A) of this section is applied to employees in descending orderof their compensation. Thus, if an employer has 11 board-appointed officersand the limit imposed under paragraph (g)(8)(i)(A) of this section is 10officers, the employee with the least compensation of those officers wouldnot be a control employee under paragraph (g)(8)(i)(A) of this section.(9) <T3>Control employee defined_Government employer.</T3> For purposes ofthis paragraph (g), a control employee of a government employer is any_(i) Elected official, or (ii) Employee whose compensation equals or exceeds the compensation paidto a Federal Government employee holding a position at Executive LevelV, determined under Chapter 11 of title 2, United States Code, as adjustedby section 5318 of title 5 United States Code. For purposes of paragraph (f), the term ``government'' includes any Federal,state or local governmental unit, and any agency or instrumentality thereof.lnstead of applying the control employee definition of paragraph (f)(6),an employer may treat all and only employees who are ``highly compensated''employees (as defined in andSection; 1.132-8(f)) as control employees forpurposes of this paragraph (f). (10) <T3>``Compensation'' defined.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (g),the term ``compensation'' has the same meaning as in section 414(q)(7).Compensation includes all amounts received from all entities treated asa single employer under section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o). Levels of compensationshall be adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as provided insection 415(d). The first such adjustment was for calendar year 1988. (11) <T3>Treatment of former employees.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph(g), an employee who was a control employee of the employer (as definedin this paragraph (g)) at any time after reaching age 55, or within threeyears of separation from the service of the employer, is a control employeewith respect to flights taken after separation from the service of theemployer. An individual who is treated as a control employee under thisparagraph (g)(11) is not counted when determining the limitation of paragraph(g)(8)(i) (A) and (B) of this section. Thus, the total number of individualstreated as control employees under such paragraphs may exceed the limitationsof such paragraphs to the extent that this paragraph (g)(11) applies. (12) <T3>Seating capacity rule</T3>_(i) <T3>In general_</T3>(A) <T3>General rule.</T3> Where 50 percent or more of the regular passengerseating capacity of an aircraft (as used by the employer) is occupied byindividuals whose flights are primarily for the employer's business (andwhose flights are excludable from income under section 132(d)), the valueof a flight on that aircraft by any employee who is not flying primarilyfor the employer's business (or who is flying primarily for the employer'sbusiness but the value of whose flight is not excludable under section132(d) by reason of section 274(c)) is deemed to be zero. See andSection;1.132-5 which limits the working condition fringe exclusion under section132(d) to situations where the employee receives the flight in connectionwith the performance of services for the employer providing the aircraft.(B) <T3>Special rules</T3>_(<T3>1</T3>) <T3>Definition of ``employee.''</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (g)(12),the term ``employee'' includes only employees of the employer, includinga partner of a partnership, providing the aircraft and does not includeindependent contractors and directors of the employer. A flight taken byan individual other than an ``employee'' as defined in the preceding sentenceis considered a flight taken by an employee for purposes of this paragraph(g)(12) only if that individual is treated as an employee pursuant to section132(f)(1) or that individual's flight is treated as a flight taken by anemployee pursuant to section 132(f)(2). If_(<T3>i</T3>) A flight by an individual is not considered a flight takenby an employee (as defined in this paragraph (g)(12)(i)), (<T3>ii</T3>) The value of that individual's flight is not excludable undersection 132(d), and (<T3>iii</T3>) The seating capacity rule of this paragraph (g) (12) otherwiseapplies, then the value of the flight provided to such an individual isthe value of a flight provided to a non-control employee pursuant to paragraph(g)(5) of this section (even if the individual who would be taxed on thevalue of the flight is a control employee). (<T3>2</T3>) <T3>Example.</T3> The special rules of paragraph (g)(12)(i)(B)(<T3>1</T3>) of this section are illustrated by the following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example.</T3> Assume that 60 percent of the regular passenger seatingcapacity of an employer's aircraft is occupied by individuals whose flightsare primarily for the employer's business and are excludable from incomeunder section 132(d). If a control employee, his spouse, and his dependentchild fly on the employer's aircraft for primarily personal reasons, thevalue of the three flights is deemed to be zero. If, however, the controlemployee's cousin were provided a flight on the employer's aircraft, thevalue of the flight taken by the cousin is determined by applying the aircraftvaluation formula of paragraph (g)(5) of this section (including the terminalcharge) and the non-control employee aircraft multiples of paragraph (g)(7)of this section.</ITAG>(ii) <T3>Application of 50-percent test to multiple flights.</T3> The seatingcapacity rule of this paragraph (g)(12) must be met both at the time theindividual whose flight is being valued boards the aircraft and at thetime the individual deplanes. For example, assume that employee A boardsan employer-provided aircraft for personal purposes in New York, New York,and that at that time 80 percent of the regular passenger seating capacityof the aircraft is occupied by individuals whose flights are primarilyfor the employer's business (and whose flights are excludable from incomeunder section 132(d)) (``the business passengers''). If the aircraft fliesdirectly to Hartford, Connecticut where all of the passengers, includingA, deplane, the requirements of the seating capacity rule of this paragraph(g)(12) have been satisfied. If instead, some of the passengers, includingA, remain on the aircraft in Hartford and the aircraft continues on toBoston, Massachusetts, where they all deplane, the requirements of theseating capacity rule of this paragraph (g)(12) will not be satisfied withrespect to A's flight from New York to Boston unless at least 50 percentof the seats comprising the aircraft's regular passenger seating capacitywere occupied by the business passengers at the time A deplanes in Boston.(iii) <T3>Regular passenger seating capacity.</T3> (A) <T3>General rule.</T3> Except as otherwise provided, the regular passengerseating capacity of an aircraft is the maximum number of seats that haveat any time on or prior to the date of the flight been on the aircraft(while owned or leased by the employer). Except to the extent excludedpursuant to paragraph (g)(12)(v) of this section, regular seating capacityincludes all seats which may be occupied by members of the flight crew.It is irrelevant that, on a particular flight, less than the maximum numberof seats are available for use because, for example, some of the seatsare removed. (B) <T3>Special rules.</T3> When determining the maximum number of seats thathave at any time on or prior to the date of the flight been on the aircraft(while owned or leased by the employer), seats that could not at any timebe legally used during takeoff and have not at any time been used duringtakeoff are not counted. As of the date an employer permanently reducesthe seating capacity of an aircraft, the regular passenger seating capacityis the reduced number of seats on the aircraft. The previous sentence shallnot apply if at any time within 24 months after such reduction any seatsare added in the aircraft. Unless the conditions of this paragraph (g)(12)(iii)(B)are satisfied, jumpseats and removable seats used solely for purposes offlight crew training are counted for purposes of the seating capacity ruleof this paragraph (g)(12). (iv) <T3>Examples.</T3> The rules of paragraph (g)(12)(iii) of this sectionare illustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Employer A and employer B order the same aircraft,except that A orders it with 10 seats and B orders it with eight seats.A always uses its aircraft as a 10-seat aircraft; B always uses its aircraftas an eight-seat aircraft. The regular passenger seating capacity of A'saircraft is 10 and of B's aircraft is eight. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatwhenever A's chief executive officer and spouse use the aircraft eightseats are removed. Even if substantially all of the use of the aircraftis by the chief executive officer and spouse, the regular passenger seatingcapacity of the aircraft is 10. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatwhenever more than eight people want to fly in B's aircraft, two extraseats are added. Even if substantially all of the use of the aircraft occurswith eight seats, the regular passenger seating capacity of the aircraftis 10. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4).</T3> Employer C purchases an aircraft with 12 seats. Threemonths later C remodels the interior of the aircraft and permanently removesfour of the seats. Upon completion of the remodeling, the regular passengerseating capacity of the aircraft is eight. If, however, any seats are addedwithin 24 months after the remodeling, the regular seating capacity ofthe aircraft is treated as 12 throughout the entire period.</ITAG>(v) <T3>Seats occupied by flight crew.</T3> When determining the regular passengerseating capacity of an aircraft, any seat occupied by a member of the flightcrew (whether or not such individual is an employee of the employer providingthe aircraft) shall not be counted, unless the purpose of the flight bysuch individual is not primarily to serve as a member of the flight crew.If the seat occupied by a member of the flight crew is not counted as apassenger seat pursuant to the previous sentence, such member of the flightcrew is disregarded in applying the 50-percent test described in the firstsentence of paragraph (g)(12)(i) of this section. For example, assume thatprior to application of this paragraph (g)(12)(v) the regular passengerseating capacity of an aircraft is one. Assume further that an employeepilots the aircraft and that the employee's flight is nor primarily forthe employer's business. If the employee's spouse occupies the other seatfor personal purposes, the seating capacity rule is not met and the valueof both flights must be included in the employee's income. If, however,the employee's flight were primarily for the employer's business (unrelatedto serving as a member of the flight crew), then the seating capacity ruleis met and the value of the flight for the employee's spouse is deemedto be zero. If the employee's flight were primarily to serve as a memberof the flight crew, then the seating capacity rule is not met and the valueof a flight by any passenger for primarily personal reasons is not deemedto be zero.(13) <T3>Erroneous use of the non-commercial flight valuation rule_</T3>(i)<T3>Certain errors in the case of a flight by a control employee.</T3>If_(A) The non-commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is appliedby an employer or a control employee, as the case may be, on a return asoriginally filed or on an amended return on the grounds that either_(<T3>1</T3>) The control employee is not in fact a control employee, or(<T3>2</T3>) The aircraft is within a specific weight classification, and(B) Either position is subsequently determined to be erroneous, the valuationrule of this paragraph (g) is not available to value the flight taken bythat control employee by the person or persons taking the erroneous position.With respect to the weight classifications, the previous sentence doesnot apply if the position taken is that the weight of the aircraft is greaterthan it is subsequently determined to be. If, with respect to a flightby a control employee, the seating capacity rule of paragraph (g)(12) ofthis section is used by an employer or the control employee, as the casemay be, on a return as originally filed or on an amended return, the valuationrule of this paragraph (g) is not available to value the flight taken bythat control employee by the person or persons taking the erroneous position.(ii) <T3>Value of flight excluded as a working condition fringe.</T3> If eitheran employer or an employee, on a return as originally filed or on an amendedreturn, excludes from the employee's income or wages all or any part ofthe value of a flight on the grounds that the flight was excludable asa working condition fringe under section 132, and that position is subsequentlydetermined to be erroneous, the valuation rule of this paragraph (g) isnot available to value the flight taken by that employee by the personor persons taking the erroneous position. Instead, the general valuationrules of paragraph (b) (5) and (6) of this section apply. (14) <T3>Consistency rules_</T3>(i) <T3>Use by the employer.</T3> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph(g)(13) of this section or andSection; 1.132-5 (m)(4), if the non-commercialflight valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is used by an employer to valueany flight provided to an employee in a calendar year, the rule must beused to value all flights provided to all employees in the calendar year.(ii) <T3>Use by the employee.</T3> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph(g)(13) of this section or andSection; 1.132-5 (m)(4), if the non-commercialflight valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is used by an employee to valuea flight provided by an employer in a calendar year, the rule must be usedto value all flights provided to the employee by that employer in the calendaryear. (h) <T3>Commercial flight valuation rule_</T3>(1) <T3>In general.</T3> Under the commercial flight valuation rule of thisparagraph (h), the value of a space-available flight (as defined in paragraph(h) (2) of this section) on a commercial aircraft is 25 percent of theactual carrier's highest unrestricted coach fare in effect for the particularflight taken. The rule of this paragraph (h) is available only to an individualdescribed in andSection; 1.132-1(b)(1).(2) <T3>Space-available flight. </T3>The commercial flight valuation rule ofthis paragraph (h) is available to value a space-available flight. Theterm ``space-available flight'' means a flight on a commercial aircraft_(i) Which is subject to the same types of restrictions customarily associatedwith flying on an employee ``stand-by'' or ``space-available'' basis, and(ii) Which meets the definition of a no-additional-cost service under section132(b), except that the flight is provided to an individual other thanthe employee or an individual treated as the employee under section 132(f).Thus. a flight is not a space-available flight if the employer guaranteesthe employee a seat on the flight or if the nondiscrimination requirementsof section 132(h)(1) and andSection; 1.132-8 are not satisfied. A flightmay be a space-available flight even if the airline that is the actualcarrier is not the employer of the employee. (3) <T3>Commercial aircraft. </T3>If the actual carrier does not offer, inthe ordinary course of its business, air transportation to customers ona per-seat basis, the commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph(h) is not available. Thus, if, in the ordinary course of its line of business,the employer only offers air transportation to customers on a charter basis,the commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (h) may not be usedto value a space-available flight on the employer's aircraft. If the commercialflight valuation rule is not available, the flight may be valued underthe non-commercial flight valuation rule of paragraph (g) of this section.(4) <T3>Timing of inclusion. </T3>The date that the flight is taken is therelevant date for purposes of applying section 61(a)(1) and this sectionto a space-available flight on a commercial aircraft. The date of purchaseor issuance of a pass or ticket is not relevant. Thus, this section appliesto a flight taken on or after January 1, 1989, regardless of the date onwhich the pass or ticket for the flight was purchased or issued. (5) <T3>Consistency rules</T3>_(i) <T3>Use by employer. </T3>If the commercial flight valuation rule of thisparagraph (h) is used by an employer to value any flight provided in acalendar year, the rule must be used to value all flights eligible foruse of the rule provided in the calendar year. (ii) <T3>Use by employee. </T3>If the commercial flight valuation rule of thisparagraph (h) is used by an employee to value a flight provided by an employerin a calendar year, the rule must be used to value all flights providedby that employer eligible for use of the rule taken by such employee inthe calendar year. (i) [Reserved.] (j) <T3>Valuation of meals provided at an employer-operated eating facilityfor employees</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The valuation rule of this paragraph (j) may be usedto value a meal provided at an employer-operated eating facility for employees(as defined in andSection; 1.132-7). For rules relating to an exclusion forthe value of meals provided at an employer-operated eating facility foremployees, see section 132(e)(2) and andSection; 1.132-7. (2) <T3>Valuation formula</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>The value of all meals provided at an employer-operatedeating facility for employees during a calendar year (``total meal value'')is 150 percent of the direct operating costs of the eating facility determinedseparately with respect to such eating facility whether or not the directoperating costs test is applied separately to such eating facility underandSection; 1.132-7(b)(2). For purposes of this paragraph (j), the definitionof direct operating costs provided in andSection; 1.132-7(b) and the adjustmentsspecified in andSection; 1.132-7(a)(2) apply. The taxable value of mealsprovided at an eating facility may be determined in two ways. The ``individualmeal subsidy'' may be treated as the taxable value of a meal provided atthe eating facility (see paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section) to a particularemployee. Alternatively, the employer may allocate the ``total meal subsidy''among employees (see paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section). (ii) <T3>``Individual meal subsidy'' defined. </T3>The ``individual meal subsidy''is determined by multiplying the amount paid by the employee for a particularmeal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total meal value andthe denominator of which is the gross receipts of the eating facility forthe calendar year and then subtracting the amount paid by the employeefor the meal. The taxable value of meals provided to a particular employeeduring a calendar year, therefore, is the sum of the individual meal subsidiesprovided to the employee during the calendar year. This rule is availableonly if there is a charge for each meal selection and if each employeeis charged the same price for any given meal selection. (iii) <T3>Allocation of ``total meal subsidy.'' </T3>Instead of using the individualmeal subsidy method provided in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, theemployer may allocate the ``total meal subsidy'' (total meal value lessthe gross receipts of the facility) among employees in any manner reasonableunder the circumstances. It will be presumed reasonable for an employerto allocate the total meal subsidy on a per-employee basis if the employerhas information that would substantiate to the satisfaction of the Commissionerthat each employee was provided approximately the same number of mealsat the facility.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection;

Special rules apply with respect to certain on-premises gyms and otherathletic facilities (andSection;1.132-1(e)), demonstration use of employer-providedautomobiles by full-time automobile salesmen (andSection;1.132-5(o)), parkingprovided to an employee on or near the business premises of the employer(andSection;1.132-5(p)), and on-premises eating facilities (andSection;1.132-7).(b) <T3>Definition of employee_(1) </T3><T3>No-additional-cost services and qualified employee discounts. </T3>Forpurposes of section 132(a)(1) (relating to no-additonal-cost services)and section 132(a)(2) (relating to qualified employee discounts), the term``employee'' (with respect to a line of business of an employer means_(i) Any individual who is currently employed by the employer in the lineof business, (ii) Any individual who was formerly employed by the employer in the lineof business and who separated from service with the employer in the lineof business by reason of retirement or disability, and (iii) Any widow or widower of an individual who died while employed bythe employer in the line of business or who separated from service withthe employer in the line of business by reason of retirement or disability.For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), any partner who performs servicesfor a partnership is considered employed by the partnership. In addition,any use by the spouse or dependent child (as defined in paragraph (b)(5)of this section) of the employee will be treated as use by the employee.For purposes of section 132(a)(1) (relating to no-additional-cost services),any use of air transportation by a parent of an employee (determined withoutregard to section 132(f)(1)(B) and paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section)will be treated as use by the employee. (2) <T3>Working condition fringes. </T3>For purposes of section 132(a)(3) (relatingto working condition fringes), the term ``employee'' means_ (i) Any individual who is currently employed by the employer, (ii) Any partner who performs services for the partnership, (iii) Any director of the employer, and  (iv) Any independent contractor who performs services for the employer.Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph (b)(2) to the contrary, an independentcontractor who performs services for the employer cannot exclude the valueof parking or the use of consumer goods provided pursuant to a producttesting program under andSection;1.132-5(n); in addition, any director ofthe employer cannot exclude the value of the use of consumer goods providedpursuant to a product testing program under andSection;1.132-5(n). (3) <T3>On-premises athletic facilities. </T3>For purposes of section 132(h)(5)(relating to on-premises athletic facilities), the term ``employee'' means_(i) Any individual who is currently employed by the employer, (ii) Any individual who was formerly employed by the employer and who separatedfrom service with the employer by reason of retirement or disability, and(iii) Any widow or widower of an individual who died while employed bythe employer or who separated from service with the employer by reasonof retirement or disability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), any partner who performs servicesfor a partnership is considered employed by the partnership. In addition,any use by the spouse or dependent child (as defined in paragraph (b)(5)of this section) of the employee will be treated as use by the employee.(4) <T3>De minimis fringes. </T3>For purposes of section 132(a)(4) (relatingto de minimis fringes), the term ``employee'' means any recipient of afringe benefit. (5) <T3>Dependent child. </T3>The term ``dependent child'' means any son, stepson,daughter, or stepdaughter of the employee who is a dependent of the employee,or both of whose parents are deceased and who has not attained age 25.Any child to whom section 152(e) applies will be treated as the dependentof both parents. (c) <T3>Special rules for employers_Effect of section 414. </T3>All employeestreated as employed by a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), (m),or (o) will be treated as employed by a single employer for purposes ofthis section. Thus, employees of one corporation that is part of a controlledgroup of corporations may under certain circumstances be eligible to receivesection 132 benefits from the other corporations that comprise the controlledgroup. However, the aggregation of employers described in this paragraph(c) does not change the other requirements for an exclusion, such as theline of business requirement. Thus, for example, if a controlled groupof corporations consists of two corporations that operate in differentlines of business, the corporations are not treated as operating in thesame line of business even though the corporations are treated as one employer.(d) <T3>Customers not to include employees. </T3>For purposes of section 132and the regulations thereunder, the term ``customer'' means any customerwho is not an employee. However, the preceding sentence does not applyto section 132(c)(2) (relating to the gross profit percentage for determininga qualified employee discount). Thus, an employer that provides employeediscounts cannot exclude sales made to employees in determining the aggregatesales to customers. (e) <T3>Treatment of on-premises athletic facilities_(1) </T3><T3>In general. </T3>Gross income does not include the value of any on-premisesathletic facility provided by an employer to its employees. For purposesof section 132(h)(5) and this paragraph (e), the term ``on-premises athleticfacility'' means any gym or other athletic facility (such as a pool, tenniscourt, or golf course)_   (i) Which is located on the premises of the employer, (ii) Which is operatedby the employer, and (iii) Substantially all of the use of which duringthe calendar year is by employees of the employer, their spouses, and theirdependent children. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of paragraph (e) (1) (iii) of this section, the term``dependent children'' has the same meaning as the plural of the term ``dependentchild'' in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The exclusion of this paragraph(e) does not apply to any athletic facility if access to the facility ismade available to the general public through the sale of memberships, therental of the facility, or a similar arrangement. (2) <T3>Premises of the employer. </T3>The athletic facility need not be locatedon the employer's business premises. However, the athletic facility mustbe located on premises of the employer. The exclusion provided in thisparagraph (e) applies whether the premises are owned or leased by the employer;in addition, the exclusion is available even if the employer is not a namedlessee on the lease so long as the employer pays reasonable rent. The exclusionprovided in this paragraph (e) does not apply to any athletic facilitythat is a facility for residential use. Thus, for example, a resort withaccompanying athletic facilities (such as tennis courts, pool, and gym)would not qualify for the exclusion provided in this paragraph (e). Anathletic facility is considered to be located on the employer's premisesif the facility is located on the premises of a voluntary employees' beneficiaryassociation funded by the employer. (3) <T3>Application of rules to membership in an athletic facility. </T3>Theexclusion provided in this paragraph (e) does not apply to any membershipin an athletic facility (including health clubs or country clubs) unlessthe facility is owned (or leased) and operated by the employer and substantiallyall the use of the facility is by employees of the employer, their spouses,and their dependent children. Therefore, membership in a health club orcountry club not meeting the rules provided in this paragraph (e) wouldnot qualify for the exclusion. (4) <T3>Operation by the employer. </T3>An employer is considered to operatethe athletic facility if the employer operates the facility through itsown employees, or if the employer contracts out to another to operate theathletic facility. For example, if an employer hires an independent contractorto operate the athletic facility for the employer's employees, the facilityis considered to be operated by the employer. In addition, if an athleticfacility is operated by more than one employer, it is considered to beoperated by each employer. For purposes of paragraph (e) (1) (iii) of thissection, substantially all of the use of a facility that is operated bymore than one employer must be by employees of the various employers, theirspouses, and their dependent children. Where the facility is operated bymore than one employer, an employer that pays rent either directly to theowner of the premises or to a sublessor of the premises is eligible forthe exclusion. If an athletic facility is operated by a voluntary employees'beneficiary association funded by an employer, the employer is consideredto operate the facility. (5) <T3>Nonapplicability of nondiscrimination rules. </T3>The nondiscriminationrules of section 132 and andSection;1.132-8 do not apply to on-premises athleticfacilities. (f) <T3>Nonapplicability of section 132 in certain cases</T3>_(1) Tax treatmentprovided for in another section. If the tax treatment or a particular fringebenefit is expressly provided for in another section of Chapter 1 of theInternal Revenue Code of 1986, section 132 and the applicable regulations(except for section 132 (e) and the regulations thereunder) do not applyto such fringe benefit. For example, because section 129 provides an exclusionfrom gross income for amounts paid or incurred by an employer for dependentcare assistance for an employee, the exclusions under section 132 and thissection do not apply to the provision by an employer to an employee ofdependent care assistance. Similarly, because section 117 (d) applies totuition reductions, the exclusions under section 132 do not apply to freeor discounted tuition provided to an employee by an organization operatedby the employer, whether the tuition is for study at or below the graduatelevel. Of course, if the amounts paid by the employer are for educationrelating to the employee's trade or business of being an employee of theemployer so that, if the employee paid for the education, the amount paidcould be deducted under section 162, the costs of the education may beeligible for exclusion as a working condition fringe. (2) <T3>Limited statutory exclusions. </T3>If another section of Chapter 1of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides an exclusion from gross incomebased on the cost of the benefit provided to the employee and such exclusionis a limited amount, section 132 and the regulations thereunder may applyto the extent the cost of the benefit exceeds the statutory exclusion.(g) <T3>Effective date. </T3>Sections 1.132-0, 1.132-1, 1.132-2, 1,132-3, 1.132-4,1.132-5, 1.132-6, 1.132-7 and 1.132-8 are effective as of January 1, 1989,except that andSection;andSection;1.132-1(b)(1) with respect to the use ofair transportation by a parent of an employee and 1.132-4(d) are effectiveas of January 1, 1985. See andSection;andSection;1.132-1T, 1.132-2T, 1.132-3T,1.132-4T, 1.132-5T, 1.132-6T, 1.132-7T and 1.132-8T for rules in effectfor benefits received from January 1, 1985, to December 31, 1988.   <T4>Par. 9. </T4>Section 1.132-2 is added and reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.132-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">No-additional-cost services.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general</T3>_(1) <T3>Definition.</T3> Gross income does not include the value of a no-additional-costservice. A ``no-additional-cost service'' is any service provided by anemployer to an employee for the employee's personal use if_(i) The service is offered for sale by the employer to its customers inthe ordinary course of the line of business of the employer in which theemployee performs substantial services, and(ii) The employer incurs no substantial additional cost in providing theservice to the employee (including foregone revenue and excluding any amountpaid by or on behalf of the employee for the service).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For rules relating to the line of business limitation, see andSection;1.132-4. For purposes of this section, a service will not be consideredto be offered for sale by the employer to its customers if that serviceis primarily provided to employees and not to the employer's customers.(2) <T3>Excess capacity services.</T3> Services that are eligible for treatmentas no-additional-cost services include excess capacity services such ashotel accommodations; transportation by aircraft, train, bus, subway, orcruise line; and telephone services. Services that are not eligible fortreatment as no-additional-cost services are non-excess capacity servicessuch as the facilitation by a stock brokerage firm of the purchase of stock.Employees who receive non-excess capacity services may, however, be eligiblefor a qualified employee discount of up to 20 percent of the value of theservice provided. See andSection; 1.132-3.(3) <T3>Cash rebates.</T3> The exclusion for a no-additional-cost service applieswhether the service is provided at no charge or at a reduced price. Theexclusion also applies if the benefit is provided through a partial ortotal cash rebate of an amount paid for the service.(4) <T3>Applicability of nondiscrimination rules.</T3> The exclusion for ano-additional-cost service applies to highly compensated employees onlyif the service is available on substantially the same terms to each memberof a group of employees that is defined under a reasonable classificationset up by the employer that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensatedemployees. See andSection; 1.132-8.(5) <T3>No substantial additional cost</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> The exclusion for a no-additional-cost service appliesonly if the employer does not incur substantial additional cost in providingthe service to the employee. For purposes of the preceding sentence, theterm ``cost'' includes revenue that is forgone because the service is providedto an employee rather than a nonemployee. (For purposes of determiningwhether any revenue is forgone, it is assumed that the employee would nothave purchased the service unless it were available to the employee atthe actual price charged to the employee.) Whether an employer incurs substantialadditional cost must be determined without regard to any amount paid bythe employee for the service. Thus, any reimbursement by the employee forthe cost of providing the service does not affect the determination ofwhether the employer incurs substantial additional cost.(ii) <T3>Labor intensive services.</T3> An employer must include the cost oflabor incurred in providing services to employees when determining whetherthe employer has incurred substantial additional cost. An employer incurssubstantial additional cost, whether non-labor costs are incurred, if asubstantial amount of time is spent by the employer or its employees inproviding the service to employees. This would be the result whether thetime spent by the employer or its employees in providing the services wouldhave been ``idle,'' or if the services were provided outside normal businesshours. An employer generally incurs no substantial additional cost, however,if the services provided to the employee are merely incidental to the primaryservice being provided by the employer. For example, the in-flight servicesof a flight attendant and the cost of in-flight meals provided to airlineemployees traveling on a space-available basis are merely incidental tothe primary service being provided (i.e., air transportation). Similarly,maid service provided to hotel employees renting hotel rooms on a space-availablebasis is merely incidental to the primary service being provided (i.e.,hotel accommodations).(6) <T3>Payments for telephone service.</T3> Payment made by an entity subjectto the modified final judgment (as defined in section 559(c)(5) of theTax Reform Act of 1984) of all or part of the cost of local telephone serviceprovided to an employee by a person other than an entity subject to themodified final judgment shall be treated as telephone service providedto the employee by the entity making the payment for purposes of this section.The preceding sentence also applies to a rebate of the amount paid by theemployee for the service and a payment to the person providing the service.This paragraph (a)(6) applies only to services and employees describedin andSection; 1.132-4 (c). For a special line of business rule relatingto such services and employees, see andSection; 1.132-4 (c).(b) <T3>Reciprocal agreements.</T3> For purposes of the exclusion from grossincome for a no-additional-cost service, an exclusion is available to anemployee of one employer for a no-additional-cost service provided by anunrelated employer only if all of the following requirements are satisfied_(1) The service provided to such employee by the unrelated employer isthe same type of service generally provided to nonemployee customers byboth the line of business in which the employee works and the line of businessin which the service is provided to such employee (so that the employeewould be permitted to exclude from gross income the value of the serviceif such service were provided directly by the employee's employer);(2) Both employers are parties to a written reciprocal agreement underwhich a group of employees of each employer, all of whom perform substantialservices in the same line of business, may receive no-additional-cost servicesfrom the other employer; and(3) Neither employer incurs any substantial additional cost (includingforgone revenue) in providing such service to the employees of the otheremployer, or pursuant to such agreement. If one employer receives a substantialpayment from the other employer with respect to the reciprocal agreement,the paying employer will be considered to have incurred a substantial additionalcost pursuant to the agreement, and consequently services performed underthe reciprocal agreement will not qualify for exclusion as no-additional-costservices.(c) <T3>Example.</T3> The rules of this section are illustrated by the followingexample:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example.</T3> Assume that a commercial airline permits its employeesto take personal flights on the airline at no charge and receive reservedseating. Because the employer forgoes potential revenue by permitting theemployees to reserve seats, employees receiving such free flights are noteligible for the no-additional-cost exclusion.</ITAG><T4>Par. 10. </T4>Section 1.132-3 is added and reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.132-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Qualified employee discounts.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general</T3>_(1) <T3>Definition.</T3> Gross income does not include the value of a qualifiedemployee discount. A ``qualified employee discount'' is any employee discountwith respect to qualified property or services provided by an employerto an employee for use by the employee to the extent the discount doesnot exceed_(i) The gross profit percentage multiplied by the price at which the propertyis offered to customers in the ordinary course of the employer's line ofbusiness, for discounts on property, or(ii) Twenty percent of the price at which the service is offered to customers,for discounts on services.(2) <T3>Qualified property or services</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> The term ``qualified property or services'' meansany property or services that are offered for sale to customers in theordinary course of the line of business of the employer in which the employeeperforms substantial services. For rules relating to the line of businesslimitation, see andSection; 1.132-4.(ii) <T3>Exception for certain property.</T3> The term ``qualified property''does not include real property and it does not include personal property(whether tangible or intangible) of a kind commonly held for investment.Thus, an employee may not exclude from gross income the amount of an employeediscount provided on the purchase of securities, commodities, or currency,or of either residential or commercial real estate, whether or not theparticular purchase is made for investment purposes.(iii) <T3>Property and services not offered in ordinary course of business.</T3>The term ``qualified property or services'' does not include any propertyor services of a kind that is not offered for sale to customers in theordinary course of the line of business of the employer. For example, employeediscounts provided on property or services that are offered for sale primarilyto employees and their families (such as merchandise sold at an employeestore or through an employer-provided catalog service) may not be excludedfrom gross income. For rules relating to employer-operated eating facilities,see andSection; 1.132-7, and for rules relating to employer-operated on-premisesathletic facilities, see andSection; 1.132-1(e).(3) <T3>No reciprocal agreement exception.</T3> The exclusion for a qualifiedemployee discount does not apply to property or services provided by anotheremployer pursuant to a written reciprocal agreement that exists betweenemployers to provide discounts on property and services to employees ofthe other employer.(4) <T3>Property or services provided without charge, at a reduced price, orby rebates.</T3> The exclusion for a qualified employee discount applieswhether the property or service is provided at no charge (in which caseonly part of the discount may be excludable as a qualified employee discount)or at a reduced price. The exclusion also applies if the benefit is providedthrough a partial or total cash rebate of an amount paid for the propertyor service.(5) <T3>Property or services provided directly by the employer or indirectlythrough a third party.</T3> A qualified employee discount may be providedeither directly by the employer or indirectly through a third party. Forexample, an employee of an appliance manufacturer may receive a qualifiedemployee discount on the manufacturer's appliances purchased at a retailstore that offers such appliances for sale to customers. The employee mayexclude the amount of the qualified employee discount whether the employeeis provided the appliance at no charge or purchases it at a reduced price,or whether the employee receives a partial or total cash rebate from eitherthe employer-manufacturer or the retailer. If an employee receives additionalrights associated with the property that are not provided by the employee'semployer to customers in the ordinary course of the line of business inwhich the employee performs substantial services (such as the right toreturn or exchange the property or special warranty rights), the employeemay only receive a qualified employee discount with respect to the propertyand not the additional rights. Receipt of such additional rights may occur,for example, when an employee of a manufacturer purchases property manufacturedby the employee's employer at a retail outlet.(6) <T3>Applicability of nondiscrimination rules.</T3> The exclusion for aqualified employee discount applies to highly compensated employees onlyif the discount is available on substantially the same terms to each memberof a group of employees that is defined under a reasonable classificationset up by the employer that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensatedemployees. See andSection; 1.132-8.(b) <T3>Employee discount</T3>_(1) <T3>Definition.</T3> The term ``employee discount'' means the excess of_(i) The price at which the property or service is being offered by theemployer for sale to customers, over(ii) The price at which the property or service is provided by the employerto an employee for use by the employee. A transfer of property by an employeewithout consideration is treated as use by the employee for purposes ofthis section. Thus, for example, if an employee receives a discount onproperty offered for sale by his employer to customers and the employeemakes a gift of the property to his parent, the property will be consideredto be provided for use by the employee; thus, the discount will be eligiblefor exclusion as a qualified employee discount.(2) <T3>Price to customers</T3>_(i) <T3>Determined at time of sale.</T3> In determining the amount of an employeediscount, the price at which the property or service is being offered tocustomers at the time of the employee's purchase is controlling. For example,assume that an employer offers a product to customers for $20 during thefirst six months of a calendar year, but at the time the employee purchasesthe product at a discount, the price at which the product is being offeredto customers is $25. In this case, the price from which the employee discountis measured is $25. Assume instead that, at the time the employee purchasesthe product at a discount, the price at which the product is being offeredto customers is $15 and the price charged the employee is $12. The employeediscount is measured from $15, the price at which the product is offeredfor sale to customers at the time of the employee purchase. Thus, the employeediscount is $15 ^$12, or $3.(ii) <T3>Quantity discount not reflected.</T3> The price at which a propertyor service is being offered to customers cannot reflect any quantity discountunless the employee actually purchases the requisite quantity of the propertyor service.(iii) <T3>Price to employer's customers controls.</T3> In determining the amountof an employee discount, the price at which a property or service is offeredto customers of the employee's employer is controlling. Thus, the priceat which the property is sold to the wholesale customers of a manufacturerwill generally be lower than the price at which the same property is soldto the customers of a retailer. However, see paragraph (a)(5) of this sectionregarding the effect of a wholesaler providing to its employees additionalrights not provided to customers of the wholesaler in the ordinary courseof its business.(iv) <T3>Discounts to discrete customer or consumer groups.</T3> Subject toparagraph (2)(ii) of this section, if an employer offers for sale propertyor services at one or more discounted prices to discrete customer or consumergroups, and sales at all such discounted prices comprise at least 35 percentof the employer's gross sales for a representative period, then in determiningthe amount of an employee discount, the price at which such property orservice is being offered to customers for purposes of this section is adiscounted price. The applicable discounted price is the current undiscountedprice, reduced by the percentage discount at which the greatest percentageof the employer's discounted gross sales are made for such representativeperiod. If sales at different percentage discounts equal the same percentageof the employer's gross sales, the price at which the property or serviceis being provided to customers may be reduced by the average of the discountsoffered to each of the two groups. For purposes of this section, a representativeperiod is the taxable year of the employer immediately preceding the taxableyear in which the property or service is provided to the employee at adiscount. If more than one employer would be aggregated under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o), and not all of the employers have the same taxableyear, the employers required to be aggregated must designate the 12-monthperiod to be used in determining gross sales for a representative period.The 12-month period designated, however, must be used on a consistent basis.(v) <T3>Examples. </T3>The rules provided in this paragraph (b)(2) are illustratedby the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Assume that a wholesale employer offers propertyfor sale to two discrete customer groups at differing prices. Assume furtherthat during the prior taxable year of the employer, 70 percent of the employer'sgross sales are made at a 15 percent discount and 30 percent at no discount.For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the current undiscounted price atwhich the property or service is being offered by the employer for saleto customers may be reduced by the 15 percent discount.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume that a retail employer offers a 20 percentdiscount to members of the American Bar Association, a 15 percent discountto members of the American Medical Association, and a ten percent discountto employees of the Federal Government. Assume further that during theprior taxable year of the employer, sales to American Bar Association membersequal 15 percent of the employer's gross sales, sales to American MedicalAssociation members equal 20 percent of the employer's gross sales, andsales to Federal Government employees equal 25 percent of the employer'sgross sales. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the current undiscountedprice at which the property or service is being offered by the employerfor sale to customers may be reduced by the ten percent Federal Governmentdiscount.</ITAG>(3) <T3>Damaged, distressed, or returned goods. </T3>If an employee pays atleast fair market value for damaged, distressed, or returned property,such employee will not have income attributable to such purchase.(c) <T3>Gross profit percentage</T3>_(1) <T3>In general</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>An exclusion from gross income for an employee discounton qualified property is limited to the price at which the property isbeing offered to customers in the ordinary course of the employer's lineof business, multiplied by the employer's gross profit percentage. Theterm ``gross profit percentage'' means the excess of the aggregate salesprice of the property sold by the employer to customers (including employees)over the employer's aggregate cost of the property, then divided by theaggregate sales price.(ii) <T3>Calculation of gross profit percentage. </T3>The gross profit percentagemust be calculated separately for each line of business based on the aggregatesales price and aggregate cost of property in that line of business fora representative period. For purposes of this section, a representativeperiod is the taxable year of the employer immediately preceding the taxableyear in which the discount is available. For example, if the aggregateamount of sales of property in an employer's line of business for the priortaxable year was $800,000, and the aggregate cost of the property for theyear was $600,000, the gross profit percentage would be 25 percent ($800,000minus $600,000, then divided by $800,000). If two or more employers arerequired to aggregate under section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o) (aggregatedemployer), and if all of the aggregated employers do not share the sametaxable year, then the aggregated employers must designate the 12-monthperiod to be used in determining the gross profit percentage. The 12-monthperiod designated, however, must be used on a consistent basis. If an employeeperforms substantial services in more than one line of business, the grossprofit percentage of the line of business in which the property is solddetermines the amount of the excludable employee discount.(iii) <T3>Special rule for employers in their first year of existence. </T3>An employer in its first year of existence may estimate the gross profitpercentage of a line of business based on its mark-up from cost. Alternatively,an employer in its first year of existence may determine the gross profitpercentage by reference to an appropriate industry average.(iv) <T3>Redetermination of gross profit percentage. </T3>If substantial changesin an employer's business indicate at any time that it is inappropriatefor the prior year's gross profit percentage to be used for the currentyear, the employer must, within a reasonable period, redetermine the grossprofit percentage for the remaining portion of the current year as if suchportion of the year were the first year of the employer's existence.(2) <T3>Line of business. </T3>In general, an employer must determine the grossprofit percentage on the basis of all property offered to customers (includingemployees) in each separate line of business. An employer may instead selecta classification of property that is narrower than the applicable lineof business. However, the classification must be reasonable. For example,if an employer computes gross profit percentage according to the departmentin which products are sold, such classification is reasonable. Similarly,it is reasonable to compute gross profit percentage on the basis of thetype of merchandise sold (such as high mark-up and low mark-up classifications).It is not reasonable, however, for an employer to classify certain lowmark-up products preferred by certain employees (such as highly compensatedemployees) with high mark-up products or to classify certain high mark-upproducts preferred by other employees with low mark-up products.(3) <T3>Generally accepted accounting principles. </T3>In general, the aggregatesales price of property must be determined in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles. An employer must compute the aggregatecost of property in the same manner in which it is computed for the employer'sFederal income tax liability; thus, for example, section 263A and the regulationsthereunder apply in determining the cost of property.(d) <T3>Treatment of leased sections of department stores</T3>_(1) <T3>In general</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>For purposes of determining whether employees ofa leased section of a department store may receive qualified employee discountsat the department store and whether employees of the department store mayreceive qualified employee discounts at the leased section of the departmentstore, the leased section is treated as part of the line of business ofthe person operating the department store, and employees of the leasedsection are treated as employees of the person operating the departmentstore as well as employees of their employer. The term ``leased sectionof a department store'' means a section of a department store where substantiallyall of the gross receipts of the leased section are from over-the-countersales of property made under a lease, license, or similar arrangement whereit appears to the general public that individuals making such sales areemployed by the department store. A leased section of a department storewhich, in connection with the offering of beautician services, customarilymakes sales of beauty aids in the ordinary course of business is deemedto derive substantially all of its gross receipts from over-the-countersales of property.(ii) <T3>Calculation of gross profit percentage.</T3> For purposes of paragraph(d) of this section, when calculating the gross profit percentage of propertyand services sold at a department store, sales of property and servicessold at the department store, as well as sales of property and servicessold at the leased section, are considered. The rule provided in the precedingsentence does not apply, however, if it is more reasonable to calculatethe gross profit percentage for the department store and leased sectionseparately, or if it would be inappropriate to combine them (such as whereeither the department store or the leased section but not both providesemployee discounts).(2) <T3>Employees of the leased section</T3>_(i) <T3>Definition.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (d), ``employees ofthe leased section'' means all employees who perform substantial servicesat the leased section of the department store regardless of whether theemployees engage in over-the-counter sales of property or services. Theterm ``employee'' has the same meaning as in section 132(f) and andSection;1.132-1(b)(1).(ii) <T3>Discounts offered to either department store employees or employeesof the leased section.</T3> If the requrements of this paragraph (d) aresatisfied, employees of the leased section may receive qualified employeediscounts at the department store whether or not employees of the departmentstore are offered discounts at the leased section. Similarly, employeesof the department store may receive a qualified employee discount at theleased section whether or not employees of the leased section are offereddiscounts at the department store.(e) <T3>Excess discounts.</T3> Unless excludable under a provision of the InternalRevenue Code of 1986 other than section 132(a)(2), an employee discountprovided on property is excludable to the extent of the gross profit percentagemultiplied by the price at which the property is being offered for saleto customers. If an employee discount exceeds the gross profit percentage,the excess discount is includible in the employee's income. For example,if the discount on employer-purchased property is 30 percent and the employer'sgross profit percentage for the period in the relevant line of businessis 25 percent, then 5 percent of the price at which the property is beingoffered for sale to customers is includible in the empoyee's income. Withrespect to services, an employee discount of up to 20 percent may be excludable.If an employee discount exceeds 20 percent, the excess discount is includiblein the employee's income. For example, assume that a commercial airlineprovides a pass to each of its employees permitting the employees to obtaina free round-trip coach ticket with a confirmed seat to any destinationthe airline services. Neither the exclusion of section 132(a)(1) (relatingto no-additional-cost services) nor any other statutory exclusion appliesto a flight taken primarily for personal purposes by an employee underthis program. However, an employee discount of up to 20 percent may beexcluded as a qualified employee discount. Thus, if the price charged tocustomers for the flight taken is $300 (under restrictions comparable tothose actually placed on travel associated with the employee airline ticket),$60 is excludible from gross income as a qualified employee discount and$240 is includible in gross income.<T4>Par. 11. </T4>Section 1.132-4 is added and reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.132-4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Line of business limitaiton.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general</T3>_(1) <T3>Applicability</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule.</T3> A no-additional-cost service or a qualified employeediscount provided to an employee is only available with respect to propertyor services that are offered for sale to customers in the ordinary courseof the same line of business in which the employee receiving the propertyor service performs substantial services. Thus, an employee who does notperform substantial services in a particular line of business of the employermay not exclude from income under section 132 (a)(1) or (a)(2) the valueof services or employee discounts received on property or services in thatline of business. For rules that relax the line of business requirement,see paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.(ii) <T3>Property and services sold to employees rather than customers. </T3>Becausethe property or services must be offered for sale to customers in the ordinarycourse of the same line of business in which the employee performs substantialservices, the line of business limitation is not satisfied if the employer'sproducts or services are sold primarily to employees of the employer, ratherthan to customers. Thus, for example, an employer in the banking line ofbusiness is not considered in the variety store line of business if theemployer establishes an employee store that offers variety store itemsfor sale to the employer's employees. See andSection; 1.132-7 for rules relatingto employer-operated eating facilities, and see andSection; 1.132-1(e) forrules relating to employer-operated on-premises athletic facilities.(iii) <T3>Performance of substantial services in more than one line of business.</T3>An employee who performs services in more than one of the employer'slines of business may only exclude no-additional-cost services and qualifiedemployee discounts in the lines of business in which the employee performssubstantial services.(iv) <T3>Performance of services that directly benefit more than one line ofbusiness</T3>_(A) <T3>In general</T3>. An employee who performs substantial services thatdirectly benefit more than one line of business of an employer is treatedas performing substantial services in all such line of business. For example,an employee who maintains accounting records for an employer's three linesof business may receive qualified employee discounts in all three linesof business. Similarly, if an employee of a minor line of business of anemployer that is significantly interrelated with a major line of businessof the employer performs substantial services that directly benefit boththe major and the minor lines of business, the employee is treated as performingsubstantial services for both the major and the minor lines of business.(B) <T3>Examples</T3>. The rules provided in this paragraph (a)(1)(iv) areillustrated by the following examples: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Assume that employees of units of an employer providerepair or financing services, or sell by catalog, with respect to retailmerchandise sold by the employer. Such employees may be considered to performsubstantial services for the retail merchandise line of business underparagraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assume that an employer operates a hospital and alaundry service. Assume further that some of the gross receipts of thelaundry service line of business are from laundry services sold to customersother than the hospital employer. Only the employees of the laundry servicewho perform substantial services which directly benefit the hospital lineof business (through the provision of laundry services to the hospital)will be treated as performing substantial services for the hospital lineof business. Other employees of the laundry service line of business willnot be treated as employees of the hospital line of business.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (2), except thatthe employer also operates a chain of dry cleaning stores. Employees whoperform substantial services which directly benefit the dry cleaning storesbut who do not perform substantial services that directly benefit the hospitalline of business will not be treated as performing substantial servicesfor the hospital line of business.</ITAG>(2) <T3>Definition</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>An employer's line of business is determined by referenceto the Enterprise Standard Industrial Classification Manual (ESIC Manual)prepared by the Statistical Policy Division of the U.S. Office of Managementand Budget. An employer is considered to have more than one line of businessif the employer offers for sale to customers property or services in morethan one two-digit code classification referred to in the ESIC Manual.(ii) <T3>Examples.</T3> Examples of two-digit classifications are general retailmerchandise stores; hotels and other lodging places; auto repair, services,and garages; and food stores.(3) <T3>Aggregation of two-digit classifications.</T3> If, pursuant to paragraph(a)(2) of this section, an employer has more than one line of business,such lines of business will be treated as a single line of business whereand to the extent that one or more of the following aggregation rules apply:(i) If it is uncommon in the industry of the employer for any of the separatelines of business of the employer to be operated without the others, theseparate lines of business are treated as one line of business.(ii) If it is common for a substantial number of employees (other thanthose employees who work at the headquarters or main office of the employer)to perform substantial services for more than one line of business of theemployer, so that determination of which employees perform substantialservices for which line or lines of business would be difficult, then theseparate lines of business of the employer in which such employees performsubstantial services are treated as one line of business. For example,assume that an employer operates a delicatessen with an attached servicecounter at which food is sold for consumption on the premises. Assume furtherthat most but not all employees work both at the delicatessen and at theservice counter. Under the aggregation rule of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii),the delicatessen and the service counter are treated as one line of business.(iii) If the retail operations of an employer that are located on the samepremises are in separate lines of business but would be considered to bewithin one line of business under paragraph (a)(2) of this section if themerchandise offered for sale in such lines of business were offered forsale at a department store, then the operations are treated as one lineof business. For example, assume that on the same premises an employersells both women's apparel and jewelry. Because, if sold together at adepartment store, the operations would be part of the same line of business,the operations are treated as one line of business.(b) <T3>Grandfather rule for certain retail stores</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> The line of business limitation may be relaxed underthe special grandfather rule of this paragraph (b). Under this specialgrandfather rule, if_(i) On October 5, 1983, at least 85 percent of the employees of one memberof an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504 without regard to subsections(b)(2) and (b)(4) thereof) (``first member'') were entitled to receiveemployee discounts at retail department stores operated by another memberof the affiliated group (``second member''), and(ii) More than 50 percent of the previous year's sales of the affiliatedgroup are attributable to the operation of retail department stores, then,for purposes of the exclusion from gross income of a qualified employeediscount, the first member is treated as engaged in the same line of businessas the second member (the opeator of the retail department stores). Therefore,employees of the first member of the affiliated group may exclude fromincome qualified employee discounts received at the retail department storesoperated by the second member. However, employees of the second memberof the affiliated group may not under this paragraph (b)(1) exclude anydiscounts received on property or services offered for sale to customersby the first member of the affiliated group.(2) <T3>Taxable year of affiliated group. </T3>If not all of the members ofan affiliated group have the same taxable year, the affiliated group mustdesignate the 12-month period to be used in determining the ``previousyear's sales'' (as referred to in the grandfather rule of this paragraph(b)). The 12-month period designated, however, must be used on a consistentbasis.(3) <T3>Definition of ``sales.'' </T3>For purposes of this paragraph (b), theterm ``sales'' means the gross receipts of an affiliated group, based uponthe accounting methods used by its members.(4) <T3>Retired and disabled employees. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph(b), an employee includes any individual who was, or whose spouse was,formerly employed by the first member of an affiliated group and who separatedfrom service with the member by reason of retirement or disability if thesecond member of the group provided employee discounts  to  tha t individual on  Octo- ber 5, 1983.(5) <T3>Increase of employee discount.</T3> If, after October 5, 1983, theemployee discount described in this paragraph (b) is increased, the grandfatherrule of this paragraph (b) does not apply to the amount of the increase.For example, if on January 1, 1989, the employee discount is increasedfrom 10 percent to 15 percent, the grandfather rule will not apply to theadditional 5 percent discount.(c) <T3>Grandfather rule for telephone service provided to predivestiture retirees.</T3>All entities subject to the modified final judgment (as defined insection 559(c)(5) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984) shall be treated as asingle employer engaged in the same line of business for purposes of determiningwhether telephone service provided to certain employees is a no-additional-costservice. The preceding sentence applies only in the case of an employeewho by reason of retirement or disability separated before January 1, 1984,from the service of an entity subject to the modified final judgment. Thisparagraph (c) only applies to services provided to such employees as ofJanuary 1, 1984. For a special no-additional-cost service rule relatingto such employees and such services, see andSection; 1.132-2(a)(6).(d) <T3>Special rule for certain affiliates of commercial airlines</T3>_(1)<T3>General rule. </T3>If a qualified affiliate is a member of an airlineaffiliated group and employees of the qualified affiliate who are directlyengaged in providing airline-related services are entitled to no-additional-costservice with respect to air transportation provided by such other member,then, for purposes of applying andSection; 1.132-2 (relating to no-additional-costservices with respect to such air transportation), such qualified affiliateshall be treated as engaged in the same line of business as such othermember.(2) <T3>``Airline affiliated group'' defined. </T3>An ``airline affiliatedgroup'' is an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504 (a)) one ofwhose members operates a commercial airline that provides air transportationto customers on a per-seat basis.(3) <T3>``Qualified affiliate'' defined.</T3> A ``qualified affiliate'' isany corporation that is predominantly engaged in providing airline-relatedservices. The term ``airline-related services'' means any of the followingservices provided in connection with air transportation:(i) Catering,(ii) Baggage handling,(iii) Ticketing and reservations,(iv) Flight planning and weather analysis, and(v) Restaurants and gift shops located at an airport.(e) <T3>Grandfather rule for affiliated groups operating airlines. </T3>Theline of business limitation may be relaxed under the special grandfatherrule of this paragraph (e). Under this special grandfather rule, if, asof September 12, 1984_(1) An individual_(i) Was an employee (within the meaning of andSection; 1.132-1 (b)) of onemember of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) (``firstcorporation''), and(ii) Was eligible for no-additional-cost services in the form of air transportationprovided by another member of such affiliated group (``second corporation''),(2) At least 50 percent of the individuals performing services for thefirst corporation were, or had been employees of, or had previously performedservices for, the second corporation, and(3) The primary business of the affiliated group was air transportationof passengers, then, for purposes of applying sections 132(a) (1) and (2),with respect to no-additional-cost services and qualified employee discountsprovided after December 31, 1984, for that individual by the second corporation,the first corporation is treated as engaged in the same air transporationline of business as the second corporation. For purposes of the precedingsentence, an employee of the second corporation who is performing servicesfor the first corporation is also treated as an employee of the first corporation.(f) <T3>Special rule for qualified air transportation organizations.</T3> Aqualified air transportation organization is treated as engaged in theline of busienss of providing air transportation with respect to any individualwho performs services for the organization if those services are peformedprimarily for persons engaged in providing air transportation, and areof a kind which (if performed on September 12, 1984) would qualify theindividual for no-additional-cost services in the form of air transportation.The term ``qualified air transportation organization'' means any organization_(1) If such organization (or a predecessor) was in existence on September12, 1984,(2) If such organization is_(i) A tax-exempt organization under section(c)(6) whose membership is limitedto entities engaged in the transportation by air of individuals or propertyfor compensation or hire, or (ii) Is a corporation all the stock of which is owned entirely by entitiesdescribed in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, and (3) If such organization is operated in furtherance of the activities ofits members or owners.(g) <T3>Relaxation of line of business requirement. </T3>The line of businessrequirement may be relaxed under an elective grandfather rule providedin section 4977. For rules relating to the section 4977 election, see andSection;54.4977-1T.(h) <T3>Line of business requirement does not expand benefits eligible forexclusion.</T3> The line of business requirement limits the benefits eligiblefor the no-additional-cost service and qualified employee discount exclusionsto property or services provided by an employer to its customers in theordinary course of the line of business of the employer in which the employeeperforms substantial services. The requirement is intended to ensure thatemployers do not offer, on a tax-free or reduced basis, property or servicesto employees that are not offered to the employer's customers, even ifthe property or services offered to the customers and the employees arewithin the same line of business (as defined in this section).<T4>Par. 12. </T4>Section 1.132-5 is added and reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1.132-5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Working condition fringes.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general_</T3>(1) <T3>Definition.</T3> Gross income does not include the value of a workingcondition fringe. A ``working condition fringe'' is any property or serviceprovided to an employee of an employer to the extent that, if the employeepaid for the property or service, the amount paid would be allowable asa deduction under section 162 or 167.(i) A service or property offered by an employer in connection with a flexiblespending account is not excludable from gross income as a working conditionfringe. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a flexible spending accountis an agreement (whether or not written) entered into between an employerand an employee that makes available to the employee over a time perioda certain level of unspecified non-cash benefits with a pre-determinedcash value.(ii) If, under section 274 or any other section, certain substantiationrequirements must be met in order for a deduction under section 162 or167 to be allowable, then those substantiation requirements apply whendetermining whether a property or service is excludable as a working conditionfringe.(iii) An amount that would be deductible by the employee under a sectionother than section 162 or 167, such as section 212, is not a working conditionfringe.(iv) A physical examination program provided by the employer is not excludableas a working condition fringe even if the value of such program might bedeductible to the employee under section 213. The previous sentence applieswithout regard to whether the employer makes the program mandatory to someor all employees.(v) A cash payment made by an employer to an employee will not qualifyas a working condition fringe unless the employer requires the employeeto_(A) Use the payment for expenses in connection with a specific or pre-arrangedactivity or undertaking for which a deduction is allowable under section162 or 167, (B) Verify that the payment is actually used for such expenses, and (C) Return to the employer any part of the payment not so used. (vi) The limitation of section 67(a) (relating to the two-percent flooron miscellaneous itemized deductions) is not considered when determiningthe amount of a working condition fringe. For example, assume that an employerprovides a $1,000 cash advance to Employee A and that the conditions ofparagraph (a)(1)(v) of this section are not satisfied. Even to the extentA uses the allowance for expenses for which a deduction is allowable undersection 162 and 167, because such cash payment is not a working conditionfringe, section 67(a) applies. The $1,000 payment is includible in A'sgross income and subject to income and employment tax withholding. If,however, the conditions of paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section are satisfiedwith respect to the payment, then the amount of A's working condition fringeis determined without regard to section 67(a). The $1,000 payment is excludiblefrom A's gross income and not subject to income and employment tax reportingand withholding. (2) <T3>Trade or business of the employee</T3>_(i) <T3>General. </T3>If the hypothetical payment for a property or servicewould be allowable as a deduction with respect to a trade or business ofan employee other than the employee's trade or business of being an employeeof the employer, it cannot be taken into account for purposes of determiningthe amount, if any, of the working condition fringe. (ii) <T3>Examples. </T3>The rule of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section maybe illustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Assume that, unrelated to company X's trade or businessand unrelated to employee A's trade or business of being an employee ofcompany X, A is a member of the board of directors of company Y. Assumefurther that company X provides A with air transportation to a companyY board of director's meeting. A may not exclude from gross income thevalue of the air transportation to the meeting as a working condition fringe.A may, however, deduct such amount under section 162 if the section 162requirements are satisfied. The result would be the same whether the airtransportation was provided in the form of a flight on a commercial airlineor a seat on a company X airplane. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1) except thatA serves on the board of directors of company Z and company Z regularlypurchases a significant amount of goods and services from company X. Becauseof the relationship between Company Z and A's employer, A's membershipon Company Z's board of directors is related to A's trade or business ofbeing an employee of Company X. Thus, A may exclude from gross income thevalue of air transportation to board meetings as a working condition fringe.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1) except thatA serves on the board of directors of a charitable organization. Assumefurther that the service by A on the charity's board is substantially relatedto company X's trade or business. In this case, A may exclude from grossincome the value of air transportation to board meetings as a working conditionfringe. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (3) except thatcompany X also provides A with the use of a company X conference room whichA uses for monthly meetings relating to the charitable organization. Alsoassume that A uses company X's copy machine and word processor each monthin connection with functions of the charitable organization. Because ofthe substantial business benefit that company X derives from A's serviceon the board of the charity, A may exclude as a working condition fringethe value of the use of company X property in connection with the charitableorganization.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Vehicle allocation rules</T3>_(1) <T3>In general</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>In general, with respect to an employer-providedvehicle, the amount excludable as a working condition fringe is the amountthat would be allowable as a deduction under section 162 or 167 if theemployee paid for the availability of the vehicle. For example, assumethat the value of the availability of an employer-provided vehicle fora full year is $2,000, without regard to any working condition fringe (i.e.,assuming all personal use). Assume Further that the employee drives thevehicle 6,000 miles for his employer's business and 2,000 miles for reasonsother than the employer's business. In this situation, the value of theworking condition fringe is $2,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numeratorof which is the business-use mileage (6,000 miles) and the denominatorof which is the total mileage (8,000 miles). Thus, the value of the workingcondition fringe is $1,500. The total amount includible in the employee'sgross income on account of the availability of the vehicle is $500 ($2,000^$1,500).For purposes of this section, the term ``vehicle'' has the meaning giventhe term in andSection; 1.61-21(e)(2). Generally, when determining the amountof an employee's working condition fringe, miles accumulated on the vehicleby all employees of the employer during the period in which the vehicleis available to the employee are considered. For example, assume that duringthe year in which the vehicle is available to the employee in the aboveexample, other employees accumulate 2,000 additional miles on the vehicle(while the employee is not in the automobile). In this case, the valueof the working condition fringe is $2,000 multiplied by a fraction, thenumerator of which is the business-use mileage by the employee (includingall mileage (business and personal) accumulated by other employees) (8,000miles) and the denominator of which is the total mileage (including allmileage accumulated by other employees) (10,000 miles). Thus, the valueof the working condition fringe is $1,600; the total amount includiblein the employee's gross income on account of the availability of the vehicleis $400 ($2,000^$1,600). If, however, substantially all of the use of theautomobile by other employees in the employer's business is limited toa certain period, such as the last three months of the year, the milesdriven by the other employees during that period would not be consideredwhen determining the employee's working condition fringe exclusion. Similarly,miles driven by other employees are not considered if the pattern of useof the employer-provided automobiles is designed to reduce Federal taxes.For example, assume that an employer provides employees A and B each withthe availability of an employer-provided automobile and that A uses theautomobile assigned to him 80 percent for the employer's business and thatB uses the automobile assigned to him 30 percent for the employer's business.If A and B alternate the use of their assigned automobiles each week insuch a way as to achieve a reduction in federal taxes, then the employermay count only miles placed on the automobile by the employee to whom theautomobile is assigned when determining each employee's working conditionfringe. (ii) <T3>Use by an individual other than the employee. </T3>For purposes ofthis section, if the availability of a vehicle to an individual would betaxed to an employee, use of the vehicle by the individual is includedin references to use by the employee. (iii) <T3>Provision of an expensive vehicle for personal use. </T3>If an employerprovides an employee with a vehicle that an employee may use in part forpersonal purposes, there is no working condition fringe exclusion withrespect to the personal miles driven by the employee; if the employee paidfor the availability of the vehicle, he would not be entitled to deductunder section 162 or 167 any part of the payment attributable to personalmiles. The amount of the inclusion is not affected by the fact that theemployee would have chosen the availability of a less expensive vehicle.Moreover, the result is the same even though the decision to provide anexpensive rather than an inexpensive vehicle is made by the employer forbona fide noncompensatory business reasons. (iv) <T3>Total value inclusion. </T3>In lieu of excluding the value of a workingcondition fringe with respect of an automobile, an employer using the automobilelease valuation rule of andSection; 1.61-21(d) may include in an employee'sgross income the entire Annual Lease Value of the automobile. Any deductionallowable to the employee under section 162 or 167 with respect to theautomobile may be taken on the employee's income tax return. The totalinclusion rule of this paragraph (b)(1)(iv) is not available if the employeris valuing the use or availability of a vehicle under general valuationprinciples or a special valuation rule other than the automobile leasevaluation rule. See section andSection; 1.162-25T for rules relating to theemployee's deduction. (v) <T3>Shared usage. </T3>In calculating the working condition fringe benefitexclusion with respect to a vehicle provided for use by more than one employee,an employer shall compute the working condition fringe in a manner consistentwith the allocation of the value of the vehicle under section 1.61-21(c)(2)(ii)(B).(2) <T3>Use of different employer-provided vehicles.</T3> The working conditionfringe exclusion must be applied on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. For example,assume that automobile Y is available to employee D for 3 days in Januaryand for 5 days in March, and automobile Z is available to D for a weekin July. Assume further that the Daily Lease Value, as defined in andSection;1.61-21(d)(4)(ii), of each automobile is $50. For the eight days of availabilityof Y in January and March, D uses Y 90 percent for business (by mileage).During July, D uses Z 60 percent for business (by mileage). The value ofthe working condition fringe is determined separately for each automobile.Therefore, the working condition fringe for Y is $360 ($400andmultiply;.90)leaving an income inclusion of $40. The working condition fringe for Zis $210 ($350andmultiply;.60), leaving an income inclusion of $140. If thevalue of the availability of an automobile is determined under the AnnualLease Value rule for one period and Daily Lease Value rule for a secondperiod (see andSection; 1.61-21(d)), the working condition fringe exclusionmust be calculated separately for the two periods. (3) <T3>Provision of a vehicle and chauffeur services</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule.</T3> In general, with respect to the value of chauffeurservices provided by an employer, the amount excludable as a working conditionfringe is the amount that would be allowable as a deduction under section162 and 167 if the employee paid for the chauffeur services. The workingcondition fringe with respect to a chauffeur is determined separately fromthe working condition fringe with respect to the vehicle. An employee mayexclude from gross income the excess of the value of the chauffeur servicesover the value of the chauffeur services for personal purposes (such ascommuting) as determined under andSection; 1.61-21(b)(5). See andSection; 1.61-21(b)(5)for additional rules and examples concerning the valuation of chauffeurservices. See andSection; 1.132-5(m)(5) for rules relating to an exclusionfrom gross income for the value of bodyguard/chauffeur services. When determiningwhether miles placed on the vehicle are for the employer's business, milesplaced on the vehicle by a chauffeur between the chauffeur's residenceand the place at which the chauffeur picks up (or drops off) the employeeare with respect to the employee (but not the chauffeur) considered tobe miles placed on the vehicle for the employer's business and thus eligiblefor the working condition fringe exclusion. Thus, because miles placedon the vehicle by a chauffeur between the chauffeur's residence and theplace at which the chauffeur picks up (or drops off) the employee are notconsidered business miles with respect to the chauffeur, the value of theavailability of the vehicle for commuting is includible in the gross incomeof the chauffeur. For general and special rules concerning the valuationof the use of employer-provided vehicles, see paragraphs (b) through (f)of andSection; 1.61-21. (ii) <T3>Examples. </T3>The rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section areillustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Assume that an employer makes available to an employeean automobile and a chauffeur. Assume further that the value of the chauffeurservices determined in accordance with andSection; 1.61-21 is $30,000 andthat the chauffeur spends 30 percent of each workday driving the employeefor personal purposes. There may be excluded from the employee's income70 percent of $30,000, or $21,000, leaving an income inclusion with respectto the chauffeur services of $9,000. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume that the value of the availability of an employer-providedvehicle for a year is $4,850 and that the value of employer-provided chauffeurservices with respect to the vehicle for the year is $20,000. Assume furtherthat 40 percent of the miles placed on the vehicle are for the employer'sbusiness and that 60 percent are for other purposes. In addition, assumethat the chauffeur spends 25 percent of each workday driving the employeefor personal purposes (i.e., 2 hours). The value of the chauffeur servicesincludible in the employee's income is 25 percent of $20,000, or $5,000.The excess of $20,000 over $5,000 or $15,000 is excluded from the employee'sincome as a working condition fringe. The amount excludable as a workingcondition fringe with respect to the vehicle is 40 percent of $4,850, or$1,940 and the amount includible is $4,850^$1,940, or $2,910.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Applicability of substantiation requirements of sections 162 and 274(d)</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The value of property or services provided to an employeemay not be excluded from the employee's gross income as a working conditionfringe, by either the employer or the employee, unless the applicable substantiationrequirements of either section 274(d) or section 162 (whichever is applicable)and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. The substantiation requirementsof section 274(d) apply to an employee even if the requirements of section274 do not apply to the employee's employer for deduction purposes (suchas when the employer is a tax-exempt organization or a governmental unit).(2) <T3>Section 274(d) requirements. </T3>The substantiation requirements ofsection 274(d) are satisfied by ``adequate records or sufficient evidencecorroborating the [employee's] own statement''. Therefore, such recordsor evidence provided by the employee, and relied upon by the employer tothe extent permitted by the regulations promulgated under section 274(d),will be sufficient to substantiate a working condition fringe exclusion.(d) <T3>Safe harbor substantiation rules</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Section 1.274-6T provides that the substantiationrequirements of section 274(d) and the regulations thereunder may be satisfied,in certain circumstances, by using one or more of the safe harbor rulesprescribed in andSection; 1.274-6T. If the employer uses one of the safeharbor rules prescribed in andSection; 1.274-6T during a period with respectto a vehicle (as defined in andSection; 1.61-21(e)(2)), that rule must beused by the employer to substantiate a working condition fringe exclusionwith respect to that vehicle during the period. An employer that is exemptfrom Federal income tax may still use one of the safe harbor rules (ifthe requirements of that section are otherwise met during a period) tosubstantiate a working condition fringe exclusion with respect to a vehicleduring the period. If the employer uses one of the methods prescribed inandSection; 1.274-6T during a period with respect to an employer-providedvehicle, that method may be used by an employee to substantiate a workingcondition fringe exclusion with respect to the same vehicle during theperiod, as long as the employee includes in gross income the amount allocatedto the employee pursuant to andSection; 1.274-6T and this section. (See andSection;1.61-21(c)(2) for other rules concerning when an employee must includein income the amount determined by the employer.) If, however, the employeruses the safe harbor rule prescribed in andSection; 1.274-6T(a) (2) or (3)and the employee without the employer's knowledge uses the vehicle forpurposes other than de minimis personal use (in the case of the rule prescribedin andSection; 1.274-6T(a)(2)), or for purposes other than de minimis personaluse and commuting (in the case of the rule prescribed in andSection; 1.274-6T(a)(3)),then the employees must include an additional amount in income for theunauthorized use of the vehicle. (2) <T3>Period for use of safe harbor rules. </T3>The rules prescribed in thisparagraph (d) assume that the safe harbor rules prescribed in andSection;1.274-6T are used for a one-year period. Accordingly, references to thevalue of the availability of a vehicle, amounts excluded as a working conditionfringe, etc., are based on a one-year period. If the safe harbor rulesprescribed in andSection; 1.274-6T are used for a period of less than a year,the amounts referred to in the previous sentence must be adjusted accordingly.For purposes of this section, the term ``personal use'' has the same meaningas prescribed in andSection; 1.274-6T (e)(5). (e) <T3>Safe harbor substantiation rule for vehicles not used for personalpurposes. </T3>For a vehicle described in andSection; 1.274-6T(a)(2) (relatingto certain vehicles not used for personal purposes), the working conditionfringe exclusion is equal to the value of the availability of the vehicleif the employer uses the method prescribed in andSection; 1.274-6T(a)(2).(f) <T3>Safe harbor substantiation rule for vehicles not available to employeesfor personal use other than commuting. </T3>For a vehicle described inandSection; 1.274-6T(a)(3) (relating to certain vehicles not used for personalpurposes other than commuting), the working condition fringe exclusionis equal to the value of the availability of the vehicle for purposes otherthan commuting if the employer uses the method prescribed in andSection;1.274-6T(a)(3). This rule applies only if the special rule for valuingcommuting use, as prescribed in andSection; 1.61-21(f), is used and the amountdetermined under the special rule is either included in the employee'sincome or reimbursed by the employee. (g) <T3>Safe harbor substantiation rule for vehicles used in connection withthe business of farming that are available to employees for personal use</T3>_(1)<T3>In general. </T3>For a vehicle described in andSection; 1.274-6T(b) (relatingto certain vehicles used in connection with the business of farming), theworking condition fringe exclusion is calculated by multiplying the valueof the availability of the vehicle by 75 percent. (2) <T3>Vehicles available to more than one individual. </T3>If the vehicleis available to more than one individual, the employer must allocate thegross income inclusion attributable to the vehicle (25 percent of the valueof the availability of the vehicle) among the employees (and other individualswhose use would not be attributed to an employee) to whom the vehicle wasavailable. This allocation must be done in a reasonable manner to reflectthe personal use of the vehicle by the individuals. An amount that wouldbe allocated to a sole proprietor reduces the amounts that may be allocatedto employees but is otherwise to be disregarded for purposes of this paragraph(g). For purposes of this paragraph (g), the value of the availabilityof a vehicle may be calculated as if the vehicle were available to onlyone employee continuously and without regard to any working condition fringeexclusion. (3) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate a reasonable allocationof gross income with respect to an employer-provided vehicle between twoemployees:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Assume that two farm employees share the use of avehicle that for a calendar year is regularly used directly in connectionwith the business of farming and qualifies for use of the rule in andSection;1.274-6T(b). Employee A uses the vehicle in the morning directly in connectionwith the business of farming and employee B uses the vehicle in the afternoondirectly in connection with the business of farming. Assume further thatemployee B takes the vehicle home in the evenings and on weekends. Theemployer should allocate all the income attributable to the availabilityof the vehicle to employee B. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assume that for a calendar year, farm employees Cand D share the use of a vehicle that is regularly used directly in connectionwith the business of farming and qualifies for use of the rule in andSection;1.2.4-6T(b). Assume further that the employees alternate taking the vehiclehome in the evening and alternate the availability of the vehicle for personalpurposes on weekends. The employer should allocate the income attributableto the availability of the vehicle for personal use (25 percent of thevalue of the availability of the vehicle) equally between the two employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (2) except thatC is the sole proprietor of the farm. Based on these facts, C should allocatethe same amount of income to D as was allocated to D in example (2). Noother income attributable to the availability of the vehicle for personaluse should be allocated.</ITAG>(h) <T3>Qualified nonpersonal use vehicles.</T3> (1) <T3>In general.</T3> Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section,100 percent of the value of the use of a qualified nonpersonal use vehicle(as described in andSection; 1.274-5T(k)) is excluded from gross income asa working condition fringe, provided that, in the case of a vehicle describedin paragraph (k) (3) through (8) of that section, the use of the vehicleconforms to the requirements of that paragraph. (2) <T3>Shared usage of qualified nonpersonal use vehicles.</T3> In general,a working condition fringe under paragraph (h) of this section is availableto the driver and all passengers of a qualified nonpersonal use vehicle.However, a working condition fringe under this paragraph (h) is availableonly with respect to the driver and not with respect to any passengersof a qualified nonpersonal use vehicle described in andSection; 1.274-5T(k)(2)(ii)(L) or (P). In this case, the passengers must comply with provisions ofthis section (excluding this paragraph (h)) to determine the applicabilityof the working condition fringe exclusion. For example, if an employerprovides a passenger bus with a capacity of 25 passengers to its employeesfor purposes of transporting employees to and/or from work, the driverof the bus may exclude from gross income as a working condition fringe100 percent of the value of the use of the vehicle. The value of the commutinguse of the employer-provided bus by the employee-passengers is includiblein their gross incomes. See andSection; 1.61-21(f) for a special rule tovalue the commuting-only use of employer-provided vehicles. (i) [Reserved]. (j) <T3>Application of section 280F.</T3> In determining the amount, if any,of an employee's working condition fringe, section 280F and the regulationsthereunder do not apply. For example, assume that an employee has availablefor a calendar year an employer-provided automobile with a fair marketvalue of $28,000. Assume further that the special rule provided in andSection;1.61-21(d) is used yielding an Annual Lease Value, as defined in andSection;1.61-21(d), of $7,750, and that all of the employee's use of the automobileis for the employer's business. The employee would be entitled to excludeas a working condition fringe the entire Annual Lease Value, despite thefact that if the employee paid for the availability of the automobile,an income inclusion would be required under andSection; 1.280F-6(d)(1). Thisparagraph (j) does not affect the applicability of section 280F to theemployer with respect to such employer-provided automobile, nor does itaffect the applicability of section 274 to either the employer or the employee.For rules concerning substantiation of an employee's working conditionfringe, see paragraph (c) of this section. (k) <T3>Aircraft allocation rule.</T3> In general, with respect to a flighton an employer-provided aircraft, the amount excludable as a working conditionfringe is the amount that would be allowable as a deduction under section162 or 167 if the employee paid for the flight on the aircraft. For example,if employee P and P's spouse fly on P's employer's airplane primarily forbusiness reasons of P's employer so that P could deduct the expenses relatingto the trip to the extent of P's payments, the value of the flights isexcludable from gross income as a working condition fringe. However, ifP's children accompany P on the trip primarily for personal reasons, thevalue of the flights by P's children are includible in P's gross income.See andSection; 1.61-21 (g) for special rules for valuing personal flightson employer-provided aircraft. (l) [Reserved.](m) <T3>Employer-provided transportation for security concerns_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The amount of a working condition fringe exclusionwith respect to employer-provided transportation is the amount that wouldbe allowable as a deduction under section 162 or 167 if the employee paidfor the transportation. Generally, if an employee pays for transportationtaken for primarily personal purposes, the employee may not deduct anypart of the amount paid. Thus, the employee may not generally exclude thevalue of employer-provided transportation as a working condition fringeif such transportation is primarily personal. If, however, for bona fidebusiness-oriented security concerns, the employee purchases transportationthat provides him or her with additional security, the employee may generallydeduct the excess of the amount actually paid for the transportation overthe amount the employee would have paid for the same mode of transportationabsent the bona fide business-oriented security concerns. This is the casewhether or not the employee would have taken the same mode of transportationabsent the bona fide business-oriented security concerns. With respectto a vehicle, the phrase ``the same mode of transportation'' means useof the same vehicle without the additional security aspects, such as bulletproofglass. With respect to air transportation, the phrase ``the same mode oftransportation'' means comparable air transportation. These same rulesapply to the determination of an employee's working condition fringe exclusion.For example, if an employer provides an employee with a vehicle for commutingand, because of bona fide business-oriented security concerns, the vehicleis specially designed for security, then the employee may exclude fromgross income the value of the special security design as a working conditionfringe. The employee may not exclude the value of the commuting from incomeas a working condition fringe because commuting is a nondeductible personalexpense. Similarly, if an employee travels on a personal trip in an employer-providedaircraft for bona fide business-oriented security concerns, the employeemay exclude the excess, if any, of the value of the flight over the amountthe employee would have paid for the same mode of transportation, but forthe bona fide business-oriented security concerns. Because personal travelis a nondeductible expense, the employee may not exclude the total valueof the trip as a working condition fringe. (2) <T3>Demonstration of bona fide business-oriented security concerns_</T3>(i)<T3>In general. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph (m), the existenceof a bona fide business-oriented security concern for the furnishing ofa specific form of transportation to an employee is determined on the basisof all facts and circumstances. Examples of factors indicating a bona fidebusiness-oriented security concern are_ (A) <T3>Terrorist activity. </T3>A recent history of violent terrorist activity(such as bombings) in the geographic area in which the transportation isprovided, unless that activity (<T3>1</T3>) is focused on a group of individuals which does not includethe employee or a similarly situated employee of an employer, or (<T3>2</T3>) occurs to a significant degree only in a location within thegeographic area where the employee does not travel; (B) <T3>Death threat. </T3>A threat on the life of the employee because ofthe employee's status as an employee of the employer, or on the life ofa similarly situated employee because of such employee's status as an employeeof an employer; (C) <T3>Threat of kidnapping. </T3>A threat of kidnapping the employee becauseof the employee's status as an employee of the employer, or of kidnappinga similarly situated employee because of such employee's status as an employeeof an employer; or (D) <T3>Threat of serious bodily harm. </T3>A threat of imposing serious bodilyharm on the employee because of the employee's status as an employee ofthe employer, or on a similarly situated employee because of such employee'sstatus as an employee of an employer. (ii) <T3>Establishment of overall security program. </T3>Notwithstanding anythingin paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section to the contrary, no bona fide business-orientedsecurity concern will be deemed to exist unless the employee's employerestablishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that an overall securityprogram has been provided with respect to the employee involved. An overallsecurity program is deemed to exist if the requirements of paragraph (m)(2)(iv)of this section are satisfied (relating to an independent security study).(iii) <T3>Overall security program_</T3>(A) <T3>Defined. </T3>An overall security program is one in which securityis provided to protect the employee on a 24-hour basis. The employee mustbe protected while at the employee's residence, while commuting to andfrom the employee's workplace, and while at the employee's workplace. Inaddition, the employee must be protected while traveling both at home andaway from home, whether for business or personal purposes. An overall securityprogram must include the provision of a bodyguard/chauffeur who is trainedin evasive driving techniques; an automobile specially equipped for security;guards, metal detectors, alarms, or similar methods of controlling accessto the employee's workplace and residence; and, in appropriate cases, flightson the employer's aircraft for business and personal reasons. (B) <T3>Application. </T3>There is no overall security program when, for example,security is provided at the employee's workplace but not at the employee'sresidence. In addition, the fact that an employer requires an employeeto travel on the employer's aircraft, or in an employer-provided vehiclethat contains special security features, does not alone constitute an overallsecurity program. The preceding sentence applies regardless of the existenceof a corporate or other resolution requiring the employee to travel inthe employer's aircraft or vehicle for personal as well as business reasons.(iv) <T3>Effect of an independent security study. </T3>An overall security programwith respect to an employee is deemed to exist if the conditions of thisparagraph (m)(2)(iv) are satisfied: (A) A security study is performed with respect to the employer and theemployee (or a similarly situated employee of the employer) by an independentsecurity consultant; (B) The security study is based on an objective assessment of all factsand circumstances; (C) The recommendation of the security study is that an overall securityprogram (as defined in paragraph (m)(2)(iii) of this section) is not necessaryand the recommendation is reasonable under the circumstances; and (D) The employer applies the specific security recommendations containedin the security study to the employee on a consistent basis. The value of transportation-related security provided pursuant to a securitystudy that meets the requirements of this paragraph (m)(2)(iv) may be excludedfrom income if the security study conclusions are reasonable and, but forthe bona fide business-oriented security concerns, the employee would nothave had such security. No exclusion from income applies to security providedby the employer that is not recommended in the security study. Securitystudy conclusions may be reasonable even if, for example, it is recommendedthat security be limited to certain geographic areas, as in the case inwhich air travel security is provided only in certain foreign countries.(3) <T3>Application of security rules to spouses and dependents.</T3> (i) <T3>In general.</T3> If a bona fide business-oriented security concernexists with respect to an employee (because, for example, threats are madeon the life of an employee), the bona fide business-oriented security concernis deemed to exist with respect to the employee's spouse and dependentsto the extent provided in this paragraph (m)(3). (ii) <T3>Certain transportation.</T3> If a working condition fringe exclusionis available under this paragraph (m) for transportation in a vehicle oraircraft provided for a bona fide business-oriented security concern withrespect to an employee, the requirements of this paragraph (m) are deemedto be satisfied with respect to transportation in the same vehicle or aircraftprovided at the same time to the employee's spouse and dependent children.(iii) <T3>Other.</T3> Except as provided in paragraph (m)(3)(ii) of this section,a bona fide business oriented security concern is deemed to exist for thespouse and dependent children of the employer only if the requirementsof paragraph (m)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section are applied independentlyto such spouse and dependent children. (4) <T3>Working condition safe harbor for travel on employer-provided aircraft.</T3>Under the safe harbor rule of this paragraph (m)(4), if, for a bona fidebusiness-oriented security concern, the employer requires that an employeetravel on an employer-provided aircraft for a personal trip, the employerand the employee may exclude from the employee's gross income, as a workingcondition fringe, the excess value of the aircraft trip over the safe harborairfare without having to show what method of transportation the employeewould have flown but for the bona fide business-oriented security concern.For purposes of the safe harbor rule of this paragraph (m)(4), the valueof the safe harbor airfare is determined under the non-commercial flightvaluation rule of andSection; 1.61-21(g) (regardless of whether the employeror employee elects to use such valuation rule) by multiplying an aircraftmultiple of 200-percent by the applicable cents-per-mile rates and thenumber of miles in the flight and then adding the applicable terminal charge.The value of the safe harbor airfare determined under this paragraph (m)(4)must be included in the employee's income (to the extent not reimbursedby the employee) regardless of whether the employee or the employer usesthe special valuation rule of andSection; 1.61-21(g). The excess of the valueof the aircraft trip over this amount may be excluded from gross incomeas a working condition fringe. If, for a bona fide business-oriented securityconcern, the employer requires that an employee's spouse and dependentstravel on an employer-provided aircraft for a personal trip, the specialrule of this paragraph (m)(4) is available to exclude the excess valueof the aircraft trips over the safe harbor airfares. (5) <T3>Bodyguard/chauffeur provided for a bona fide business-oriented securityconcern.</T3> If an employer provides an employee with vehicle transportationand a bodyguard/chauffeur for a bona fide business-oriented security concern,and but for the bona fide business-oriented security concern the employeewould not have had a bodyguard or a chauffeur, then the entire value ofthe services of the bodyguard/chauffeur is excludable from gross incomeas a working condition fringe. For purposes of this section, a bodyguard/chauffeurmust be trained in evasive driving techniques. An individual who performsservices as a driver for an employee is not a bodyguard/chauffeur if theindividual is not trained in evasive driving techniques. Thus, no partof the value of the services of such an individual is excludable from grossincome under this paragraph (m)(5). (See paragraph (b)(3) of this sectionfor rules relating to the determination of the working condition fringeexclusion for chauffeur services.) (6) <T3>Examples.</T3> The provisions of this paragraph (m) may be illustratedby the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Assume that in response to several death threatson the life of A, the president of X a multinational company, X establishesan overall security program for A, including an alarm system at A's homeand guards at A's workplace, the use of a vehicle that is specially equippedwith alarms, bulletproof glass, and armor plating, and a bodyguard/chauffeur.Assume further that A is driven for both personal and business reasonsin the vehicle. Also, assume that but for the bona fide business-orientedsecurity concerns, no part of the overall security program would have beenprovided to A. With respect to the transportation provided for securityreasons, A may exclude as a working condition fringe the value of the specialsecurity features of the vehicle and the value attributable to the bodyguard/chauffeur.Thus, if the value of the specially equipped vehicle is $40,000, and thevalue of the vehicle without the security features is $25,000, A may determineA's inclusion in income attributable to the vehicle as if the vehicle wereworth $25,000. A must include in income the value of the availability ofthe vehicle for personal use. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assume that B is the chief executive officer of Y,a multinational corporation. Assume further that there have been kidnappingattempts and other terrorist activities in the foreign countries in whichB performs services and that at least some of such activities have beendirected against B or similarly situated employees. ln response to theseactivities, Y provides B with an overall security program, including analarm system at B's home and bodyguards at B's workplace, a bodyguard/chauffeur,and a vehicle specially designed for security during B's overseas travels.In addition, assume that Y requires B to travel in Y's airplane for businessand personal trips taken to, from, and within these foreign countries.Also, assume that but for bona fide business-oriented security concerns,no part of the overall security program would have been provided to B.B may exclude as a working condition fringe the value of the special securityfeatures of the automobile and the value attributable to the bodyguardsand the bodyguard/chauffeur. B may also exclude the excess, if any, ofthe value of the flights over the amount A would have paid for the samemode of transportation but for the security concerns. As an alternativeto the preceding sentence, B may use the working condition safe harbordescribed in paragraph (m)(4) of this section and exclude as a workingcondition fringe the excess, if any, of the value of personal flights inthe Y airplane over the safe harbor airfare determined under the methoddescribed in paragraph (m)(4) of this section. If this alternative is used,B must include in income the value of the availability of the vehicle forpersonal use and the value of the safe harbor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (2) except thatY also requires B to travel in Y's airplane within the United States, andprovides B with a chauffeur-driven limousine for business and personaltravel in the United States. Assume further that Y also requires B's spouseand dependents to travel in Y's airplane for personal flights in the UnitedStates. If no bona fide business-oriented security concern exists withrespect to travel in the United States, B may not exclude from income anyportion of the value of the availability of the chauffeur or limousinefor personal use in the United States. Thus, B must include in income thevalue of the availability of the vehicle and chauffeur for personal use.In addition, B may not exclude any portion of the value attributable topersonal flights by B or B's spouse and dependents on Y's airplane. Thus,B must include in income the value attributable to the personal use ofY's airplane. See andSection; 1.61-21 for rules relating to the valuationof an employer-provided vehicle and chauffeur, and personal flights onemployer-provided airplanes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4).</T3> Assume that company Z retains an independent securityconsultant to perform a security study with respect to its chief executiveofficer. Assume further that, based on an objective assessment of the factsand circumstances, the security consultant reasonably recommends that 24-hourprotection is not necessary but that the employee be provided securityat his workplace and for ground transportation, but not for air transportation.If company Z follows the recommendations on a consistent basis, an overallsecurity program will be deemed to exist with respect to the workplaceand ground transportation security only. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (4) except thatcompany Z only provides the employee security while commuting to and fromwork, but not for any other ground transportation. Because the recommendationsof the independent security study are not applied on a consistent basis,an overall security program will not be deemed to exist. Thus, the valueof commuting to and from work is not excludable from income. However, thevalue of a bodyguard with professional security training who does not providechauffeur or other personal services to the employee or any member of theemployee's family may be excludable as a working condition fringe if suchexpense would be otherwise allowable as a deduction by the employee undersection 162 or 167.</ITAG>(n) <T3>Product testing_</T3>(1) <T3>In general.</T3> The fair market value of the use of consumer goods,which are manufactured for sale to nonemployees, for product testing andevaluation by an employee of the manufacturer outside the employer's workplace,is excludible from gross income as a working condition fringe if_(i) Consumer testing and evaluation of the product is an ordinary and necessarybusiness expense of the employer; (ii) Business reasons necessitate that the testing and evaluation of theproduct be performed off the employer's business premises by employees(i.e., the testing and evaluation cannot be carried out adequately in theemployer's office or in laboratory testing facilities); (iii) The product is furnished to the employee for purposes of testingand evaluation; (iv) The product is made available to the employee for no longer than necessaryto test and evaluate its performance and (to the extent not exhausted)must be returned to the employer at completion of the testing and evaluationperiod; (v) The employer imposes limits on the employee's use of the product thatsignificantly reduce the value of any personal benefit to the employee;and (vi) The employee must submit detailed reports to the employer on the testingand evaluation. The length of the testing and evaluation period must bereasonable in relation to the product being tested. (2) <T3>Employer-imposed limits.</T3> The requirement of paragraph (n)(1)(v)of this section is satisfied if_(i) The employer places limits on the employee's ability to select amongdifferent models or varieties of the consumer product that is furnishedfor testing and evaluation purposes; and (ii) The employer generally prohibits use of the product by persons otherthan the employee and, in appropriate cases, requires the employee, topurchase or lease at the employee's own expense the same type of productas that being tested (so that personal use by the employee's family willbe limited). In addition, any charge by the employer for the personal useby an employee of a product being tested shall be taken into account indetermining whether the requirement of paragraph (n)(1)(v) of this sectionis satisfied. (3) <T3>Discriminating classifications.</T3> If an employer furnishes productsunder a testing and evaluation program only, or presumably, to certainclasses of employees (such as highly compensated employees, as definedin andSection; 1.132-8(g)), this fact may be relevant when determining whetherthe products are furnished for testing and evaluation purposes or for compensationpurposes, unless the employer can show a business reason for the classificationof employees to whom the products are furnished (e.g., that automobilesare furnished for testing and evaluation by an automobile manufacturerto its design engineers and supervisory mechanics). (4) <T3>Factors that negate the existence of a product testing program.</T3>If an employer fails to tabulate and examine the results of the detailedreports submitted by employees within a reasonable period of time afterexpiration of the testing period, the program will not be considered aproduct testing program for purposes of the exclusion of this paragraph(n). Existence of one or more of the following factors may also establishthat the program is not a bona fide product testing program for purposesof the exclusion of this paragraph (n): (i) The program is in essence a leasing program under which employees leasethe consumer goods from the employer for a fee; (ii) The nature of the product and other considerations are insufficientto justify the testing program; or (iii) The expense of the program outweighs the benefits to be gained fromtesting and evaluation. (5) <T3>Failure to meet the requirements of this paragraph (n).</T3> The fairmarket value of the use of property for product testing and evaluationby an employee outside the employee's workplace, under a product testingprogram that does not meet all of the requirements of this paragraph (n),is not excludable from gross income as a working condition fringe underthis paragraph (n). (6) <T3>Example.</T3> The rules of this paragraph (n) may be illustrated bythe following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example.</T3> Assume that an employer that manufactures automobilesestablishes a product testing program under which 50 of its 5,000 employeestest and evaluate the automobiles for 30 days. Assume further that the50 employees represent a fair cross-section of all of the employees ofthe employer, such employees submit detailed reports to the employer onthe testing and evaluation, the employer tabulates and examines the testresults within a reasonable time, and the use of the automobiles is restrictedto the employees. If the employer imposes the limits described in paragraph(n)(2) of this section, the employees may exclude the value of the useof the automobile during the testing and evaluation period.</ITAG>(o) <T3>Qualified automobile demonstration use_</T3>(1) <T3>In general.</T3> The value of qualified automobile demonstration useis excludable from gross income as a working condition fringe. ``Qualifiedautomobile demonstration use'' is any use of a demonstration automobileby a full-time automobile salesman in the sales area in which the automobiledealer's sales office is located if_(i) Such use is provided primarily to facilitate the salesman's performanceof services for the employer; and (ii) There are substantial restrictions on the personal use of the automobileby the salesman. (2) <T3>Full-time automobile salesman_</T3>(i) <T3>Defined.</T3> The term ``full-time automobile salesman'' means anyindividual who_(A) Is employed by an automobile dealer;(B) Customarily spends at least half of a normal business day performingthe functions of a floor salesperson or sales manager;(C) Directly engages in substantial promotion and negotiation of salesto customers; (D) Customarily works a number of hours considered full-time in the industry(but at a rate not less than 1,000 hours per year); and (E) Derives at least 25 percent of his or her gross income from the automobi1edealership directly as a result of the activities described in paragraphs(o)(2)(i) (B) and (C) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of paragraph (o)(2)(i) (E) of this section, income isnot considered to be derived directly as a result of activities describedin paragraphs (o)(2)(i) (B) and (C) of this section to the extent thatthe income is attributable to an individual's ownership interest in thedealership. An individual will not be considered to engage in direct salesactivities if the individual's sales-related activities are substantiallylimited to review of sales price offers from customers. An individual,such as the general manager of an automobi1e dealership, who receives asales commission on the sale of an automobile is not a full-time automobilesalesman unless the requirements of this paragraph (o)(2)(i) are met. Theexclusion provided in this paragraph (o) is available to an individualwho meets the definition of this paragraph (o)(2)(i) whether the individualperforms services in addition to those described in this paragraph (o)(2)(i).For example, an individual who is an owner of the automobile dealershipbut who otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph (o)(2)(i) mayexclude from gross income the value of qualified automobile demonstrationuse. However, the exclusion of this paragraph (o) is not available to ownersof large automobile dealerships who do not customarily engage in significantsales activities. (ii) <T3>Use by an individual other than a full-time automobile salesman. </T3>Personaluse of a demonstration automobile by an individual other than a full-timeautomobile salesman is not treated as a working condition fringe. Therefore,any personal use, including commuting use, of a demonstration automobileby a part-time salesman, automobile mechanic, or other individual who isnot a full-time automobile salesman is not ``qualified automobile demonstrationuse'' and thus not excludable from gross income. This is the case whetheror not the personal use is within the sales area (as defined in paragraph(o)(5) of this section). (3) <T3>Demonstration automobile. </T3>The exclusion provided in this paragraph(o) applies only to qualified use of a demonstration automobile. A demonstrationautomobile is an automobile that is_ (i) Currently in the inventory of the automobile dealership; and (ii) Available for test drives by customers during the normal businesshours of the employee. (4) <T3>Substantial restrictions on personal use. </T3>Substantial restrictionson the personal use of a demonstration automobile exist when all of thefollowing conditions are satisfied: (i) Use by individuals other than the full-time automobile salesmen (e.g.,the salesman's family) is prohibited; (ii) Use for personal vacation trips is prohibited; (iii) The storage of personal possessions in the automobile is prohibited;and (iv) The total use by mileage of the automobile by the salesman outsidethe salesman's normal working hours is limited. (5) <T3>Sales area_(i) </T3><T3>In general. </T3>Qualified automobile demonstration use consists ofuse in the sales area in which the automobile dealer's sales office islocated. The sales area is the geographic area surrounding the automobiledealer's sales office from which the office regularly derives customers.(ii) <T3>Sales area safe harbor. </T3>With respect to a particular full-timesalesman, the automobile dealer's sales area may be treated as the areawithin a radius of the larger of_ (A) 75 miles or (B) The one-way commuting distance (in miles) of the particular salesmanfrom the dealer's sales office. (6) <T3>Applicability of substantiation requirements of sections 162 and 274(d).</T3>Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the valueof the use of a demonstration automobile may not be excluded from grossincome as a working condition fringe, by either the employer or the employee,unless, with respect to the restrictions of paragraph (o)(4) of this section,the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and the regulations thereunderare satisfied. See andSection; 1.132-5(c) for general and safe harbor rulesrelating to the applicability of the substantiation requirements of section274(d). (7) <T3>Special valuation rules. </T3>See andSection; 1.61-21(d)(6)(ii) for specialrules that may be used to value the availability of demonstration automobiles.(p) <T3>Parking_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The value of parking provided to an employee on ornear the business premises of the employer is excludable from gross incomeas a working condition fringe under the special rule of this paragraph(p). If the rules of this paragraph (p) are satisfied, the value of parkingis excludable from gross income whether the amount paid by the employeefor parking would be deductible under section 162. The working conditionfringe exclusion applies whether the employer owns or rents the parkingfacility or parking space. (2) <T3>Reimbursement of parking expenses. </T3>A reimbursement to the employeeof the ordinary and necessary expenses of renting a parking space on ornear the business premises of the employer is excludable from gross incomeas a working condition fringe, if, but for the parking expense, the employeewould not have been entitled to receive and retain such amount from theemployer. If, however an employee is entitled to retain a general transportationallowance or a similar benefit whether or not the employee has parkingexpenses, no portion of that allowance is excludable from gross incomeunder this paragraph (p) even if it is used for parking expenses. (3) <T3>Parking on residential property. </T3>With respect to an employee,this paragraph (p) does not apply to any parking facility or space locatedon property owned or leased by the employee for residential purposes. (q) <T3>Nonapplicability of nondiscrimination rules. </T3>Except to the extentprovided in paragraph (n)(3) of this section (relating to discriminatingclassifications of a product testing program), the nondiscrimination rulesof section 132 (h)(1) and andSection; 1.132-8 do not apply in determiningthe amount, if any, of a working condition fringe.<T4>Par. 13. </T4>Section 1.132-6 is added and reads as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.132-6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">De minimis fringes. </ITAG>(a) <T3>In general. </T3>Gross income does not include the value of a de minimisfringe provided to an employee. The term ``de minimis fringe'' means anyproperty or service the value of which is (after taking into account thefrequency with which similar fringes are provided by the employer to theemployer's employees) so small as to make accounting for it unreasonableor administratively impracticable. (b) <T3>Frequency</T3>_(1) <T3>Employee-measured frequency. </T3>Generally, the frequency with whichsimilar fringes are provided by the employer to the employer's employeesis determined by reference to the frequency with which the employer providesthe fringes to each individual employee. For example, if an employer providesa free meal in kind to one employee on a daily basis, but not to any otheremployee, the value of the meals is not de minimis with respect to thatone employee even though with respect to the employer's entire workforcethe meals are provided ``infrequently.'' (2) <T3>Employer-measured frequency. </T3>Notwithstanding the rule of paragraph(b)(1) of this section, except for purposes of applying the special rulesof paragraph (d)(2) of this section, where it would be administrativelydifficult to determine frequency with respect to individual employees,the frequency with which similar fringes are provided by the employer tothe employer's employees is determined by reference to the frequency withwhich the employer provides the fringes to the workforce as a whole. Therefore,under this rule, the frequency with which any individual employee receivessuch a fringe benefit is not relevant and in some circumstances, the deminimis fringe exclusion may apply with respect to a benefit even thougha particular employee receives the benefit frequently. For example, ifan employer exercises sufficient control and imposes significant restrictionson the personal use of a company copying machine so that at least 85 percentof the use of the machine is for business purposes, any personal use ofthe copying machine by particular employees is considered to be a de minimisfringe. (c) <T3>Administrability. </T3>Unless excluded by a provision of chapter 1of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 other than section 132(a)(4), thevalue of any fringe benefit that would not be unreasonable or administrativelyimpracticable to account for is includible in the employee's gross income.Thus, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the provisionof any cash fringe benefit is never excludable under section 132(a) asa de minimis fringe benefit. Similarly except as otherwise provided inparagraph (d) of this section, a cash equivalent fringe benefit (such asa fringe benefit provided to an employee through the use of a gift certificateor charge or credit card) is generally not excludable under section 132(a)even if the same property or service acquired (if provided in kind) wouldbe excludable as a de minimis fringe benefit. For example, the provisionof cash to an employee for a theatre ticket that would itself be excludableas a de minimis fringe (see paragraph (e)(1) of this section) is not excludableas a de minimis fringe. (d) <T3>Special rules</T3>_(1) <T3>Transit passes. </T3>A public transit pass provided at a discount todefray an employee's commuting costs may be excluded from the employee'sgross income as a de minimis fringe if such discount does not exceed $15in any month. The exclusion provided in this paragraph (d)(1) also appliesto the provision of tokens or fare cards that enable an individual to travelon the public transit system if the value of such tokens and fare cardsin any month does not exceed by more than $15 the amount the employee paidfor the tokens and farecards for such month. Similarly, the exclusion ofthis paragraph (d)(1) applies to the provision of a voucher or similarinstrument that is exchangeable solely for tokens, farecards, or otherinstruments that enable the employee to use the public transit system ifthe value of such vouchers and other instruments in any month does notexceed $15. The exclusion provided in this paragraph (d)(1) does not applyto the provision of any benefit to defray public transit expenses incurredfor personal travel other than commuting. (2) <T3>Occasional meal money or local transportation fare</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>Meals, meal money or local transportation fare providedto an employee is excluded as a de minimis fringe benefit if the benefitprovided is reasonable and is provided in a manner that satisfies the followingthree conditions: (A) <T3>Occasional basis. </T3>The meals, meal money or local transportationfare is provided to the employee on an occasional basis. Whether meal moneyor local transportation fare is provided to an employee on an occasionalbasis will depend upon the frequency i.e. the availability of the benefitand regularity with which the benefit is provided by the employer to theemployee. Thus, meals, meal money, or local transportation fare or a combinationof such benefits provided to an employee on a regular or routine basisis not provided on an occasional basis. (B) <T3>Overtime. </T3>The meals, meal money or local transportation fare isprovided to an employee because overtime work necessitates an extensionof the employee's normal work schedule. This condition does not fail tobe satisifed merely because the circumstances giving rise to the need forovertime work are reasonably foreseeable. (C) <T3>Meal money. </T3>ln the case of a meal or meal money, the meal or mealmoney is provided to enable the employee to work overtime. Thus, for example,meals provided on the employer's premises that are consumed during theperiod that the employee works overtime or meal money provided for mealsconsumed during such period satisfy this condition. In no event shall meal money or local transportation fare calculated onthe basis of the number of hours worked (e.g., $1.00 per hour for eachhour over eight hours) be considered a de minimis fringe benefit. (ii) <T3>Applicability of other exclusions for certain meals and for transportationprovided for security concerns. </T3>The value of meals furnished to anemployee, an employee's spouse, or any of the employee's dependents byor on behalf of the employee's employer for the convenience of the employeris excluded from the employee's gross income if the meals are furnishedon the business premises of the employer (see section 119). (For purposesof the exclusion under section 119, the definitions of an employee underandSection; 1.132-1(b) do not apply.) If, for a bona fide business-orientedsecurity concern, an employer provides an employee vehicle transportationthat is specially designed for security (for example, the vehicle is equippedwith bulletproof glass and armor plating), and the conditions of andSection;1.132-5(m) are satisfied, the value of the special security design is excludablefrom gross income as a working condition fringe if the employee would nothave had such special security design but for the bona fide business-orientedsecurity concern.(iii) <T3>Special rule for employer-provided transportation provided in certaincircumstances.</T3> (A) <T3>Partial exclusion of value.</T3> If an employer provides transportation(such as taxi fare to an employee for use in commuting to and/or from workbecause or unusual circumstances and because, based on the facts and circumstances,it is unsafe for the employee to use other available means of transportation,the excess of the value of each one-way trip over $1.50 per one-way commuteis excluded from gross income. The rule of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) isnot available to a control employee as defined in andSection; 1.61-21(f)(5) and (6). (B) <T3>``Unusual circumstances''.</T3> Unusual circumstances are determinedwith respect to the employee receiving the transportation and are basedon all facts and circumstances. An example of unusual circumstances wouldbe when an employee is asked to work outside of his normal work hours (suchas being called to the workplace at 1:00 am when the employee normallyworks from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm). Another example of unusual circumstancesis a temporary change in the employee's work schedule (such as workingfrom 12 midnight to 8:00 am rather than from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm for a two-weekperiod). (C) <T3>``Unsafe conditions''.</T3> Factors indicating whether it is unsafefor an employee to use other available means of transportation are thehistory of crime in the geographic area surrounding the employee's workplaceor residence and the time of day during which the employee must commute.(3) <T3>Use of special rules or examples to establish a general rule.</T3>The special rules provided in this paragraph (d) or examples provided inparagraph (e) of this section may not be used to establish any generalrule permitting exclusion as a de minimis fringe. For example, the factthat $180 (i.e., $15 per month for l2 months) worth of public transit passescan be excluded from gross income as a de minimis fringe in a year doesnot mean that any fringe benefit with a value equal to or less than $180may be excluded as a de minimis fringe. As another example, the fact thatthe commuting use of an employer-provided vehicle more than one day a monthis an example of a benefit not excludable as a de minimis fringe (see paragraph(e)(2) of this section) does not mean that the commuting use of a vehicleup to 12 times per year is excludable from gross income as a de minimisfringe. (4) <T3>Benefits exceeding value and frequency limits.</T3> If a benefit providedto an employee is not de minimis because either the value or frequencyexceeds a limit provided in this paragraph (d), no amount of the benefitis considered to be a de minimis fringe. For example, if an employer providesa $20 monthly public transit pass, the entire $20 must be included in income,not just the excess value over $15. (e) <T3>Examples_</T3>(1) <T3>Benefits excludable from income.</T3> Examples of de minimis fringebenefits are occasional typing of personal letters by a company secretary;occasional personal use of an employer's copying machine, provided thatthe employer exercises sufficient control and imposes significant restrictionson the personal use of the machine so that at least 85 percent of the useof the machine is for business purposes; occasional cocktail parties, groupmeals, or picnics for employees and their guests; traditional birthdayor holiday gifts of property (not cash) with a low fair market value; occasionaltheater or sporting event tickets; coffee, doughnuts, and soft drinks;local telephone calls; and flowers, fruit, books, or similar property providedto employees under special circumstances (e.g., on account of illness,outstanding performance, or family crisis). (2) <T3>Benefits not excludable as de minimis fringes.</T3> Examples of fringebenefits that are not excludable from gross income as de minimis fringesare: season tickets to sporting or theatrical events; the commuting useof an employer-provided automobile or other vehicle more than one day amonth; membership in a private country club or athletic facility, regardlessof the frequency with which the employee uses the facility; employer-providedgroup-term life insurance on the life of the spouse or child of an employee;and use of employer-owned or leased facilities (such as an apartment, huntinglodge, boat, etc.) for a weekend. Some amount of the value of certain ofthese fringe benefits may be excluded from income under other statutoryprovisions, such as the exclusion for working condition fringes. See andSection;1.132-5.(f) <T3>Nonapplicability of nondiscrimination rules.</T3> Except to the extentprovided in andSection; 1.132-7, the nondiscrimination rules of section 132(h)(1)and andSection; 1.132-8 do not apply in determining the amount, if any, ofa de minimis fringe. Thus, a fringe benefit may be excludable as a de minimisfringe even if the benefit is provided exclusively to highly compensatedemployees of the employer. <T4>Par. 14. </T4>Section 1.132-7 is added and reads as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.132-7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Employer-operated eating facilities. </ITAG>(a) <T3>In general</T3>_(1) <T3>Condition for exclusion</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule.</T3> The value of meals provided to employees at an employer-operatedeating facility for employees is excludable from gross income as a de minimisfringe only if on an annual basis, the revenue from the facility equalsor exceeds the direct operating costs of the facility. (ii) <T3>Additional condition for highly compensated employees.</T3> With respectto any highly compensated employee, an exclusion is available under thissection only if the condition set out in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this sectionis satisfied and access to the facility is available on substantially thesame terms to each member of a group of employees that is defined undera reasonable classification set up by the employer that does not discriminatein favor of highly compensated employees. See andSection; 1.132-8. For purposesof this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), each dining room or cafeteria in which mealsare served is treated as a separate eating facility, whether each suchdining room or cafeteria has its own kitchen or other food-preparationarea. (2) <T3>Employer-operated eating facility for employees.</T3> An employer-operatedeating facility for employees is a facility that meets all of the followingconditions_(i) The facility is owned or leased by the employer, (ii) The facility is operated by the employer, (iii) The facility is located on or near the business premises of the employer,and (iv) The meals furnished at the facility are provided during, or immediatelybefore or after, the employee's workday. For purposes of this section, the term ``meals'' means food, beverages,and related services provided at the facility. If an employer can reasonablydetermine the number of meals that are excludable from income by the recipientemployees under section 119, the employer may, in determining whether therequirement of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is satisfied, disregardall costs and revenues attributable to such meals provided to such employees.lf an employer can reasonably determine the number of meals received byvolunteers who receive food and beverages at a hospital, free or at a discount,the employer may, in determining whether the requirement of paragraph (a)(1)(i)of this section is satisfied, disregard all costs and revenues attributableto such meals provided to such volunteers. If an employer charges nonemployeesa greater amount than employees, in determining whether the requirementof paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is satisfied, the employer mustdisregard all costs and revenues attributable to such meals provided tosuch nonemployees. (3) <T3>Operation by the employer.</T3> If an employer contracts with anotherto operate an eating facility for its employees, the facility is consideredto be operated by the employer for purposes of this section. If an eatingfacility is operated by more than one employer, it is considered to beoperated by each employer. (4) <T3>Example.</T3> The provisions of this paragraph (a)(2) may be illustratedby the following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Assume that a not-for-profit hospital system maintainscafeterias for the use of its employees and volunteers. Only the employeesare charged for food service at the cafeteria and the policy of the hospitalis to charge the employees only for the costs of food, beverage and labordirectly attributable to the meal. Most of the cafeterias within the systemfurnish more free meals to volunteers than they serve paid meals to employees.For purposes of this paragraph, as long as the employer can accuratelydetermine the number of meals received free or at a discount by volunteers,the employer may disregard all the costs and revenues attributable to suchmeals provided to volunteers. Therefore, for purposes of this paragraph,the costs of the hospital system for furnishing meals to employees whopay for them are the costs to be compared to determine if the revenuesfrom the facility equal or exceed direct operating costs of the facility'sservice to employees.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Direct operating costs</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> For purposes of this section, the direct operatingcosts of an eating facility are_(i) The cost of food and beverages, and (ii) The cost of labor for personnel whose services relating to the facilityare performed primarily on the premises of the eating facility. Directoperating costs do not include the labor cost attributable to personnelwhose services relating to the facility are not performed primarily onthe premises of the eating facility. Thus, for example, the labor costsattributable to cooks, waiters, and waitresses are included in direct operatingcosts, but the labor cost attributable to a manager of an eating facilitywhose services relating to the facility are not primarily performed onthe premises of the eating facility is not included in direct operatingcosts. If an employee performs services relating to the facility both onand off the premises of the eating facility, only the portion of the totallabor cost of the employee relating to the facility that bears the sameproportion to such total labor cost as time spent on the premises bearsto total time spent performing services relating to the facility is includedin direct operating costs. For example, assume that 60 percent of the servicesof a cook in the above example are not related to the eating facility.Only 40 percent of the total labor cost of the cook is includible in directoperating costs. For purposes of this section, labor costs include allcompensation required to be reported on a Form W-2 for income tax purposesand related employment taxes paid by the employer. In determining the directoperating costs of an eating facility, the employer may include as partof the facility, vending machines that are provided by the employer andlocated on the same premises as the other eating facilities operated bythe employer. (2) <T3>Multiple dining rooms or cafeterias.</T3> The direct operating coststest may be applied separately for each dining room or cafeteria. Alternatively,the direct operating costs test may be applied with respect to all theeating facilities operated by the employer. (3) <T3>Payment to operator of facility.</T3> If an employer contracts withanother to operate an eating facility for its employees, the direct operatingcosts of the facility consist both of direct operating costs, if any, incurredby the employer and the amount paid to the operator of the facility tothe extent that such amount is attributable to what would be direct operatingcosts if the employer operated the facility directly. (c) <T3>Valuation of non-excluded meals provided at an employer-operated eatingfacility for employees.</T3> If the exclusion for meals provided at anemployer-operated eating facility for employees is not available, the recipientof meals provided at such facility must include in income the amount bywhich the fair market value of the meals provided exceeds the sum of_(1) The amount, if any, paid for the meals, and (2) The amount, if any, specifically excluded by another section of chapter1 of this subtitle. For special valuation rules relating to such meals, see andSection; 1.61-21(j).<T4>Par. 15. </T4>Section 1.132-8 is added and reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.132-8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fringe benefit nondiscrimination rules. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Application of nondiscrimination rules</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>A highly compensated employee who receives a no-additionalcost service, a qualified employee discount or a meal provided at an employer-operatedeating facility for employees shall not be permitted to exclude such benefitfrom his or her income unless the benefit is available on substantiallythe same terms to: (i) All employees of the employer; or (ii) A group of employees of the employer which is defined under a reasonableclassification set up by the employer that does not discriminate in favorof highly compensated employees. See paragraph (f) of this section forthe definition of a highly compensated employee. (2) <T3>Consequences of discrimination</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> If an employer maintains more than one fringe benefitprogram, i.e., either different fringe benefits being provided to the samegroup of employees, or different classifications of employees or the samefringe benefit being provided to two or more classifications of employees,the nondiscrimination requirements of section 132 will generally be appliedseparately to each such program. Thus, a determination that one fringebenefit program discriminates in favor of highly compensated employeesgenerally will not cause other fringe benefit programs covering the samehighly compensated employees to be treated as discriminatory. If the fringebenefits provided to a highly compensated individual do not satisfy thenondiscrimination rules provided in this section, such individual shallbe unable to exclude from gross income any portion of the benefit. Forexample, if an employer offers a 20 percent discount (which otherwise satisfiesthe requirements for a qualified employee discount) to all non-highly compensatedemployees and a 35 percent discount to all highly compensated employees,the entire value of the 35 percent discount (not just the excess over 20percent) is includible in the gross income and wages of the highly compensatedemployees who make purchases at a discount. (ii) <T3>Exception</T3>_(A) <T3>Related fringe benefit programs. </T3>If one of a group of fringe benefitprograms discriminates in favor of highly compensated employees, no relatedfringe benefit provided to such highly compensated employees under anyother fringe benefit program may be excluded from the gross income of suchhighly compensated employees. For example, assume a department store providesa 20 percent merchandise discount to all employees under one fringe benefitprogram. Assume further that under a second fringe benefit program, thedepartment store provides an additional 15 percent merchandise discountto a group of employees defined under a classification which discriminatesin favor of highly compensated employees. Because the second fringe benefitprogram is discriminatory, the 15 percent merchandise discount providedto the highly compensated employees is not a qualified employee discount.In addition, because the 20 percent merchandise discount provided underthe first fringe benefit program is related to the fringe benefit providedunder the second fringe benefit program, the 20 percent merchandise discountprovided the highly compensated employees is not a qualified employee discount.Thus, the entire 35 percent merchandise discount provided to the highlycompensated employees is includible in such employees' gross incomes. (B) <T3>Employer operated eating facilities for employees. </T3>For purposesof paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, meals at different employer-operatedeating facilities for employees are not related fringe benefits, so thata highly compensated employee may exclude from gross income the value ofa meal at a nondiscriminatory facility even though any meals provided tohim or her at a discriminatory facility cannot be excluded. (3) <T3>Scope of the nondiscrimination rules provided in this section. </T3>Thenondiscrimination rules provided in this section apply only to fringe benefitsprovided pursuant to section 132 (a)(1), (a)(2), and (e)(2). These ruleshave no application to any other employee benefit that may be subject tonondiscrimination requirements under any other section of the Code. (b) <T3>Aggregation of employees</T3>_(1) <T3>Section 132(a) (1) and (2). </T3>For purposes of determining whetherthe exclusions for no-additional-cost services and qualified employee discountsare available to highly compensated employees, the nondiscrimination rulesof this section are applied by aggregating the employees of all relatedemployers (as defined in andSection; 1.132-1(c)), except that employees indifferent lines of business (as defined in andSection; 1.132-4) are not tobe aggregated. Thus, in general, for purposes of this section, the term``employees of the employer'' refers to all employees of the employer andany other entity that is a member of a group described in sections 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) and that performs services within the same line ofbusiness as the employer which provides the particular fringe benefit.Employees in different lines of business will be aggregated, however, ifthe line of business limitation has been relaxed pursuant to paragraphs(b) through (g) of andSection; 1.132-4. (2) <T3>Section 132 (e) (2). </T3>For purposes of determining whether the exclusionsfor meals provided at employer-operated eating facilities are availableto highly compensated, the nondiscrimination rules of this section areapplied by aggregating the employees of all related employers (as definedin section andSection; 1.132-1(c)) who regularly work at or near the premiseson which the eating facility is located, except that employees in differentlines of business (as defined in andSection; 1.132-4) are not to be aggregated.The nondiscrimination rules of this section are applied separately to eacheating facility. Each dining room or cafeteria in which meals are servedis treated as a separate eating facility, regardless of whether each suchdining room or cafeteria has its own kitchen or other food-preparationarea. (3) <T3>Classes of employees who may be excluded. </T3>For purposes of applyingthe nondiscrimination rules of this section to a particular fringe benefitprogram, there may be excluded from consideration employees who may beexcluded from consideration under section 89(h), as enacted by the TaxReform Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085 (1986) and amended bythe Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-647, 102Stat. 3342 (1988). (c) <T3>Availability on substantially the same terms</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>The determination of whether a benefit is availableon substantially the same terms shall be made upon the basis of the factsand circumstances of each situation. In general, however, if any one ofthe terms or conditions governing the availability of a particular benefitto one or more employees varies from any one of the terms or conditionsgoverning the availability of a benefit made available to one or more otheremployees, such benefit shall not be considered to be available on substantiallythe same terms except to the extent otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)of this section. For example, if a department store provides a 20 percentqualified employee discount to all of its employees on all merchandise,the substantially the same terms requirement will be satisfied. Similarly,if the discount provided to all employees is 30 percent on certain merchandise(such as apparel), and 20 percent on all other merchandise, the substantiallythe same terms requirement will be satisfied. However, if a departmentstore provides a 20 percent qualified employee discount to all employees,but as to the employees in certain departments, the discount is availableupon hire, and as to the remaining departments, the discount is only availablewhen an employee has completed a specified term of services, the 20 percentdiscount is not available on substantially the same terms to all of theemployees of the employer. Similarly, if a greater discount is given toemployees with more seniority, full-time work status, or a particular jobdescription, such benefit (i.e., the discount) would not be available toall employees eligible for the discount on substantially the same terms,except to the extent otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.These examples also apply to no-additional-cost-services. Thus, if an employercharges non-highly compensated employees for a no-additional-cost serviceand does not charge highly compensated employees (or charges highly compensatedemployees a lesser amount), the substantially the same terms requirementwill not be satisfied. (2) <T3>Certain terms relating to priority. </T3>Certain fringe benefits madeavailable to employees are available only in limited quantities that maybe insufficient to meet employee demand. This situation may occur eitherbecause of employer policy (such as where an employer determines that onlya certain number of units of a specific product will be made availableto employees each year) or because of the nature of the fringe benefit(such as where an employer provides a no-additional-cost transportationservice that is limited to the number of seats available just before departure).Under these circumstances, an employer may find it necessary to establishsome method of allocating the limited fringe benefits among the employeeseligible to receive the fringe benefits. The employer may establish thepriorities described below. (i) <T3>Priority on a first come, first served, or similar basis. </T3>A benefitshall not fail to be treated as available to a group of employees on substantiallythe same terms merely because the employer allocates the benefit amongsuch employees on a ``first come, first served'' or lottery basis, providedthat the same notice of the terms of availability is given to all employeesin the group and the terms under which the benefit is provided to employeeswithin the group are otherwise the same with respect to all employees.For purposes of the preceding sentence, a program that gives priority toemployees who are the first to submit written requests for the benefitwill constitute priority on a ``first come, first served'' basis. Similarly,if the employer regularly engages in the practice of allocating benefitson a priority basis to employees demonstrating a critical need, such benefitshall not fail to be treated as available on substantially the same termsto all of the employees with respect to whom such priority status is availableas long as the determination is based upon uniform and objective criteriawhich have been communicated to all employees in the group of eligibleemployees. An example of a critical need would be priority transportationgiven to an employee in the event of a medical emergency involving theemployee (or a member of the employee's immediate family) or a recent deathin the employee's immediate family. Frustrated vacation plans or forfeiteddeposits would not be treated as giving rise to particularly critical needs.(ii) <T3>Priority on the basis of seniority. </T3>Solely for purposes of andSection;1.132-8, a benefit shall not fail to be treated as available to a groupof employees of the employer on substantially the same terms merely becausethe employer allocates the benefit among such employees on a senioritybasis provided that: (A) The same notice of the terms of availability is given to all employeesin the group; and (B) The average value of the benefit provided for each nonhighly compensatedemployee is at least 75% of that provided for each highly compensated employee.For purposes of this test, the average value of the benefit provided foreach nonhighly compensated (highly compensated) employee is determinedby taking the sum of the fair market values of such benefit provided toall the nonhighly compensated (highly compensated) employees, determinedin accordance with andSection;1.61-21, and then dividing that sum by thetotal number of nonhighly compensated (highly compensated) employees ofthe employer. For purposes of determining the average value of the benefitprovided for each employee, all employee's of the employer are counted,including those who are not eligible to receive the benefit from the employer.(d) <T3>Testing for discrimination. </T3>(1) <T3>Classification test. </T3>In the event that a benefit described insection 132 (a)(1), (a)(2) or (e)(2) is not available on substantiallythe same terms to all of the employees of the employer, no exclusion shallbe available to a highly compensated employee for such benefit unless theprogram under which the benefit is provided satisfies the nondiscriminationstandards set forth in this section. The nondiscrimination standard ofthis section will be satisfied only if the benefit is available on substantiallythe same terms to a group of employees of the employer which is definedunder a reasonable classification established by the employer that doesnot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. The determinationof whether a particular classification is discriminatory will generallydepend upon the facts and circumstances involved, based upon principlessimilar to those applied for purposes of section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) or, foryears commencing prior to January 1, 1988, section 410(b)(1)(B). Thus,in general, except as otherwise provided in this section, if a benefitis available on substantially the same terms to a group of employees which,when compared with all of the other employees of the employer, constitutesa nondiscriminatory classification under section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) (or, ifapplicable, section 410(b)(1)(B)), it shall be deemed to be nondiscriminatory.(2) <T3>Classifications that are per se discriminatory. </T3>A classificationthat, on its face, makes fringe benefits available principally to highlycompensated employees is per se discriminatory. In addition, a classificationthat is based on either an amount or rate of compensation is per se discriminatoryif it favors those with the higher amount or rate of compensation. On theother hand, a classification that is based on factors such as seniority,full-time vs. part-time employment, or job description is not per se discriminatorybut may be discriminatory as applied to the workforce of a particular employer.(3) <T3>Former employees. </T3>When determining whether a classification isdiscriminatory, former employees shall be tested separately from otheremployees of the employer. Therefore, a classification is not discriminatorysolely because the employer does not make fringe benefits available toany former employee. Whether a classification of former employees discriminatesin favor of highly compensated employees will depend upon the particularfacts and circumstances.(4) <T3>Restructuring of benefits. </T3>For purposes of testing whether a particulargroup of employees would constitute a discriminatory classification forpurposes of this section, an employer may restructure its fringe benefitprogram as described in this paragraph. If a fringe benefit is providedto more than one group of employees, and one or more such groups wouldconstitute a discriminatory classification if considered by itself, thenfor purposes of this section, the employer may restructure its fringe benefitprogram so that all or some of the members of such group may be aggregatedwith another group, provided that each member of the restructured groupwill have available to him or her the same benefit upon the same termsand conditions. For example, assume that all highly compensated employeesof an employer have fewer than five years of service and all nonhighlycompensated employees have over five years of service. If the employerprovided a five percent discount to employees with under five years ofservice and a ten percent discount to employees with over five years ofservice, the discount program available to the highly compensated employeeswould not satisfy the nondiscriminatory classification test; however, asa result of the rule described in this paragraph (d)(4), the employer couldstructure the program to consist of a five percent discount for all employeesand a five percent additional discount for nonhighly compensated employees.(5) <T3>Employer-operated eating facilities for employees</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>If access to an employer-operated eating facilityfor employees is available to a classification of employees that discriminatesin favor of highly compensated employees, then the classification willnot be treated as discriminating in favor of highly compensated employeesunless the facility is used by one or more executive group employees morethan a de minimis amount. (ii) <T3>Executive group employee. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5),an employee is an ``executive group employee'' if the definition of paragraph(f)(1) of this section is satisfied. For purposes of identifying such employees,the phrase ``top one percent of the employees'' is substituted for thephrase ``top ten percent of the employees'' in section 414(q)(4) (relatingto the definition of ``top-paid group''). (e) <T3>Cash bonuses or rebates. </T3>A cash bonus or rebate provided to anemployee by an employer that is determined with reference to the valueof employer-provided property or services purchased by the employee, istreated as an equivalent employee discount. For example, assume a departmentstore provides a 20 percent merchandise discount to all employees undera fringe benefit program. In addition, assume that the department storeprovides cash bonuses to a group of employees defined under a classificationwhich discriminates in favor of highly compensated employees. Assume furtherthat such cash bonuses equal 15 percent of the value of merchandise purchasedby each employee. This arrangement is substantively identical to the exampledescribed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section concerning related fringebenefit programs. Thus, both the 20 percent merchandise discount and the15 percent cash bonus provided to the highly compensated employees areincludible in such employees' gross incomes. (f) <T3>Highly compensated employee</T3>_(1) <T3>Government and nongovernment employees. </T3>A highly compensated employeeof any employer is any employee who, during the year or the preceding year_(i) Was a 5-percent owner, (ii) Received compensation from the employer in excess of $75,000, (iii) Received compensation from the employer in excess of $50,000 andwas in the top-paid group of employees for such year, or (iv) Was at any time an officer and received compensation greater than150 percent of the amount in effect under section 415(c)(1)(A) for suchyear. For purposes of determining whether an employee is a highly compensatedemployee, the rules of sections 414 (q), (s), and (t) apply. (2) <T3>Former employees. </T3>A former employee shall be treated as a highlycompensated employee if_ (i) The employee was a highly compensated employee when the employee separatedfrom service, or (ii) The employee was a highly compensated employee at any time after attainingage 55.
