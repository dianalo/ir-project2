The plan proposed by Gov. Bruce Sundlun balances financialrealities with political necessities: the deficit-riddenstate can't afford to fully cover the losses of the troubledinstitutions immediately, but it had to take some actionbecause the savings of hundreds of thousands of depositorsare at risk.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There really isn't a painless solution&quot; for the state ordepositors, said William Sweeney, an economics professor atBryant College in Smithfield, R.I. &quot;The state can't payeveryone all their money immediately because unfortunatelythe state of Rhode Island is broke.&quot; The bailout is similarto programs adopted by Ohio and Maryland, which closedinstitutions in 1985 after deposit insurers there failed.   The Rhode Island institutions being bailed out are themost troubled and among the largest of the 45 institutionsclosed by Gov. Sundlun following the failure of a privatedeposit insurer whose reserves were depleted by the collapseof a small bank. About half of the closed institutionsreopened yesterday after qualifying for federal depositinsurance, but the others -- which hold some $1 billion indeposits -- have been rejected because they are so weakfinancially.   The state House of Representatives said yesterday it willhire a banking lawyer from out of state to conduct a fullinvestigation into the banking crisis. State officials havebeen criticized for ignoring a 1985 report warning about theshaky condition of the private insurer, and for failing tomore closely regulate risky real estate loans by theinstitutions now closed.   The new governor, who closed the institutions shortlyafter his inauguration Jan. 1, hopes the plan will ease thebanking crisis, which has prompted a brief run on at leastone healthy bank in the state. In addition, hundreds ofthousands of residents in the state have been cut off fromtheir savings, and many have run short of cash needed to payfor basic necessities.   Under the plan, depositors in the troubled institutionswould begin receiving cash in two weeks, with smalldepositors getting a majority of their money quickly.Depositors would receive as soon as Jan. 21 all of the moneyin their checking accounts up to a maximum of $10,000 andhalf of the money in their savings accounts up to $2,500. Theplan must be approved by the closed institutions and thelegislature.   For the remaining money in checking and savings accounts-- and for all other savings, such as money in certificatesof deposit and individual retirement accounts -- customerswon't receive cash immediately. Instead, they would be givennoninterest bearing certificates of indebtedness from a newstate agency called the Depositors Economic Protection Corp.The agency would take over the assets at the closedinstitutions and pay depositors by liquidating assets.   Some depositors -- those with more than $100,000 in anaccount -- won't be made whole for the amount over $100,000.Moreover, Gov. Sundlun said it could take four years to paycash to depositors with certificates of indebtedness. &quot;Up tofour years isn't good,&quot; Mr. Sweeney said. &quot;I would be verydisheartened if I were a depositor at one of those {closedinstitutions}.&quot;   Still, the state said that eventually nearly alldepositors will receive the full amount in their accounts. &quot;Idon't know too many people in Rhode Island with over$100,000&quot; in an account, a spokesman for the governor said.Moreover, noting that the state wasn't legally obligated tobail out the institutions, he added, &quot;Given the way it couldhave been, getting all the money&quot; -- even if over an extendedperiod -- &quot;is much better than the alternative.&quot;   The state estimates the bailout will cost it up to $150million, which is the difference between the estimated valueof the assets it would take over and the amount of thedeposits in the institutions that remain closed. The costwill be spread over the years it takes to make the payouts.The governor's spokesman said the state can't afford to paydepositors all they are owed immediately because it alreadyfaces a $162 million deficit on its $1.5 billion budget.</TEXT></DOC>
