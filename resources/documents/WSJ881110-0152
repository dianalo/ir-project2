There is no cash. The Social Security surplus is held in the form of nonmarketable interest-bearing Treasury IOUs. The cash itself is commingled with the government's general revenues and spent in support of its annual budget. In the near term the surplus can be used to finance government budget deficits or to retire debt, a prospect that thrills the financial markets. However, this simply shifts the debt, which grows with accumulated interest, to the future. Then, when the Social Security surplus turns into a deficit, the Treasury has to redeem these IOUs by selling bonds in the market. </TEXT></DOC>
