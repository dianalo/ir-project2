Judging from available records, such people never die; they justkeep collecting their checks, the inspector general of theDepartment of Health and Human Services told Congress on Tuesday.   ``Those program benefits go on forever and ever,'' InspectorGeneral Richard Kusserow told the Senate Governmental AffairsCommittee.   Kusserow said the government doesn't know how widespread theproblem is, or how costly, or where it is greatest, because HHSdepends on local governments and the State Department to validatedeaths and tell Washington when to stop checks.   ``In rural Mexico or the Philippines ... a local constabulary isgoing to stop a benefit from going into a village? No,'' he toldthe panel.   Kusserow said he's also suspicious of the long lifespans ofpeople who retire to Poland, where the benefits are distributedthrough the government. But there's no evidence of wrongdoing, hesaid.   The panel's chairman, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, suggested proofcould be found ``when you have people who are obviously 120 yearsold'' collecting benefits.   The department's independent auditor said he liked a suggestionby Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, to impose regular check-inrequirements on people collecting benefits abroad.   ``I think it's a good idea that periodically they should produceevidence that they are alive and well,'' Kusserow said. ``Prettysoon we'll find people living throughout the world and not justTransylvania will never die.''</TEXT></DOC>
