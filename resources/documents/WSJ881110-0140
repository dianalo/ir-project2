Avtex Fibers Front Royal Inc., a closely held Front Royal, Va., fiber manufacturer is the nation's only producer of carbonized rayon yarn used to insulate solid-rocket nozzles. Ultimately, NASA said, the federal government and aerospace companies may pay Avtex $38 million to continue production.    Russell Bardos, a NASA propulsion expert who is overseeing negotiations with Avtex, said NASA hoped to get one year's supply of the carbonized cloth from Avtex. During that time, he said, NASA would try to find a second supplier of the material.    Mr. Bardos said NASA would make payments to Avtex during the next few weeks to keep the company in business. Should the company fail and close its doors again, Mr. Bardos said, NASA wanted to get possession of Avtex's formula for making the carbonized rayon.    &quot;We're providing feeder money to keep the plant from closing,&quot; Mr. Bardos said. NASA has said it has enough carbonized rayon for a dozen shuttle launches. The material also is used in the MX and Midgetman missiles and a host of tactical missiles.    Avtex, which closed its factory last week, said it planned to reopen immediately. It said it was forced to close its mill because it had lost business to foreign-owned rayon makers that used cheap raw materials from South Africa. But Avtex, which employs 1,300 people, also has been beset by a host of environmental and workplace-safety complaints that have cost it millions of dollars to try to correct.    Avtex Chairman John Gregg said NASA and the Pentagon helped the concern negotiate long-term contracts with aerospace companies, to help assure its survival. Carbonized rayon has represented a small portion of Avtex's business, but Mr. Gregg said the company would emphasize such specialty products to &quot;limit its vulnerability to unfair competition from foreign-owned competitors.&quot;    NASA and the Pentagon often prefer to buy crucial raw materials from U.S.-owned businesses to guard against supply cutoffs during emergencies. It also will be difficult and expensive for another company to win Defense Department and NASA approval to produce carbonized rayon and enter competition against Avtex. The company would have to pass a series of stringent tests, including rocket test firings, before the government would approve the new supplier.    Avtex's carbonized rayon is the raw material used in solid-fuel rocket-motor insulation. The Avtex material is processed and refined in three steps by three different companies before it is sold to such rocket makers as Morton Thiokol Inc., which cut and shape the material for rocket insulation.    An Air Force spokesman said he wasn't aware of the plan. Mr. Bardos said NASA just briefed the Pentagon late yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
