A: Uhh, it would be extremely difficult to get the money, ifthat's what you're saying, yeah.   Yes?   Q: Mr. President, Nancy Reagan says that you went to see her andsaid you agreed that Don Regan should leave as chief of staff, butthat when she asked you to go to President Reagan, you said thatwas not your role. Number one, is that the way you remember it? Andnumber two, now that Quayle is vice president, if he thought therewas someone who was not serving you well, do you agree that it'snot his role to come and tell you that?   A: No, I think it's his role to tell me anything that's on hismind, which is exactly the relationship I had with President Reaganand that's the way I worked as vice president.   Q: Mr. President, could you just answer the. ...   A: No, I can't help you on that. I don't want to get into thatone _ (laughter). (Laughs) What was the next question, why? Nevermind. (Laughter.)   Q: Mr. President, given that today is Election Day, I wonder ifyou're satisfied with the level of political discourse you see, ifyou think that this negativism that's being raised in one campaignafter another is excessive, and if you feel you can do anythingabout it yourself, given that your last campaign was quite negativeor critical, if you prefer that word?   A: I think everybody would prefer the positives. What someconsider negative, others consider factual. So, you always have ajudgmental problem there. But, I'm not sure there is much that apresident can do about it in terms of _ I don't want to inhibit acandidate from taking his case to the people or her case to thepeople in any way he or she sees fit. On the other hand, I thinkthe American people have a way of sorting out what's fair andwhat's not fair, what's ugly and what isn't ugly. And I have greatconfidence in that, that they're right this election day a yearago. I think they sorted through some of these allegations thatthis was the ugliest, dirtiest campaign, and I think they voted ona more positive basis than that.   Q: Mr. President, how _ coming off of Ken's question, though _how do you respond to those who suggest that the negativecampaigning that started earlier in this campaign than usual is alegacy of '88, when it was shown to be successful?   A: Well, I don't say anything started in 1988 that hadn't beentaking place in '86 or '84 or '82 or '80 or so _ you know _ and ifyou look into history, you're going to have certain things that areconsidered negative. I don't have to stand here and defend thecampaign of 1988. I'd be perfectly prepared to do it, but I waselected. I put confidence in the American people, their ability tosort through what is fair and what is unfair, what is ugly and whatis unugly. And be as positive as possible, but while people wererunning around, you know, in campaigns talking about _ talkingabout ads this year _ the candidates have been out there takingtheir case on various _ various issues out there. So, I _ I thinkwe're _ I think there's a little bit of a Beltway syndrome here interms of this intense focus on negativism. And, yet, if their trendis that way, maybe I can have a role in seeing that it gets alittle more positive.   Q: How would you do that?   A: Well, say I think it ought to be a little more positive.(Laughter). I mean, what else can you do? I'm certainly not goingto legislate it, and certainly not going to try to dictate to acandidate how he or she, you know, reacts in a certain situation.But, there will be _ I suppose there'll be a lot of interpretationon one candidate or another, and we'll all go back to whether thereneeds some other way to approach this. But when you get right downto it, I do not want to see legislation try to get into thisquestion. It gets into a censorship mode that I just would feelvery uncomfortable with.   Ann, and then I've got to go.   MORE</TEXT></DOC>
