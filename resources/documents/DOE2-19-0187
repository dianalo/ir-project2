The main objectives of the SSTOP enhancementswere to provide fuel consumption estimates, sensitivity analysis improvements,and theoretical refinements in order to increase the overall performanceof the program. The addition of fuel consumption estimates and economicanalysis to SSTOP provides the user with extra measures of effectivenessin order to evaluate data which are a direct result of the timing plans.Sensitivity analysis enhancements provide the user with greater modellingcapabilities by specifying volume conversion factors and stop penaltiesto individual links. Theoretical enhancements to SSTOP have increasedthe accuracy of the Random Delay component, which in turn will providea more realistic estimate of potential fuel consumption savings undervarious scenarios. The SSTOP program enhancements were tested on a networkof five signalized intersections. A manual review of the SSTOP outputconcluded that the program produced results which compare favourablywith manual results based on engineering judgement and experience.</TEXT></DOC>
