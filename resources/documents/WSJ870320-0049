The banks are said to be seeking an agreement despite the fact that South Africa has not indicated it will move toward the political and economic reforms the banks have been pushing for.    A meeting of South African debt negotiators and the country's major creditor banks is set for April 24. Chris Stals, South Africa's director-general of finance and head of its debt-negotiating team, confirmed he is &quot;in close contact&quot; with the so-called technical committee of the creditor banks. Renewal of the current agreement is the basis for the talks, but the accord may be subject to some modifications in the interests of both sides, he said.    Under the current pact, which was reached in February 1986, South Africa agreed to repay $2.5 billion last year, including $500 million of principal. The government had proposed much easier repayment terms, including a moratorium on payments until 1990. But South Africa has been meticulous in making debt payments on time since last year's agreement. Mr. Stals said last September that the country intends to repay a further $2 billion in 1987. The country's foreign debt is now around $21 billion.    Last year, creditor banks indicated their concern over South Africa's political and economic problems. They pressed for reforms, but didn't write preconditions into the February agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
