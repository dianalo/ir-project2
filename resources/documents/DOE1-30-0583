Included is adiagram of a cavity that may grow as a result of water entering a borehole.The fresh water may originate at the top and be withdrawn to anotheraquifer at the bottom of the salt bed. The reverse arrangement may alsooccur, and will be considered later. Salt will dissolve at the cavitywall. For the present, we will assume that the brine produced at thesalt face immediately mixes with bulk fluid at the same level in thecavity. Our objective is to calculate the rate of growth and shape ofthe cavity. To do this, we must also calculate the flow field withinthe bulk of the cavity and the bulk concentration profile, since thelatter affects the solution rate at each depth. Separate equations governthe brine concentration and the fluid flow, and these equations are coupled.The dissolving rate of salt is obtained from the mass-transfer coefficientand the difference between the concentration of salt in equilibrium withsolid salt and the concentration in the bulk fluid at the same depth.2 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
