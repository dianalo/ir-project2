It is difficult, if not impossible, to evaluatethe practical roles of current developments with any perspective, historicalor otherwise. Waves of enthusiasm come and go. A simple analysis by Cassenof the factors entering into an overall performance index of any scanningor imaging system clearly shows that appreciable advances in instrumentationdepend upon more efficient utilization of available gamma photons, andthat future advances will depend upon the availability of agents havinga greater photon yield and a smaller potential radiation dose. Further,the needs of the referring physician and improvements in other diagnosticmodalities will have an impact on the future of nuclear medicine imagingrequirements. For example, the availability of {sup 201}T1 for myocardialimaging significantly increased the demand for spatial resolution ofthe scintillation camera. Likewise, the introduction of gated blood-poolimaging increased the requirements for count rate capabilities and spatialresolution. The need to evaluate the myocardium in the intensive careunit resulted in the development of the portable scintillation cameraand computer. On the other hand, the introduction of CT for evaluatingthe brain had a significant impact on the value of nuclear medicine brainimaging. The impact of digital radiology and nuclear magnetic resonancecan only be speculated at this point. If anything, they will probablyserve as complements to nuclear medicine procedures in the diagnosticprocess, with nuclear medicine serving as the primary method of establishingfunctional information</TEXT></DOC>
