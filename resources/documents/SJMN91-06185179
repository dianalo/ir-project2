But his pitching arm will prevent him from basking in All-Starlimelight.;    The Minnesota Twins on Tuesday placed Erickson on the 15-daydisabled list with a strained right elbow, retroactive to Sunday. He'll beeligible to come off the D.L. on July 14, five days after the All-Star Game.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  INJURY ENDS ERICKSON'S ALL-STAR HOPES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The Twins said that in discussions with league President Bobby Brown andA's Manager Tony La Russa, who will manage the A.L. team, they were told thatErickson would have been selected to the team and in all likelihood named theleague's starting pitcher. The Twins' suggestion of Erickson being named tothe team in a non-participatory role was rejected.;    &quot;If it was possible, Iwould have liked to have pitched in the All-Star Game, but that's not going tobe the way it is,&quot; Erickson said. &quot;It's in my best interests to take a break.I'd rather be available at the end of the season than for the All-Star Game.&quot;;   Erickson said the elbow has been bothering him for the last five starts. Hesaid the discomfort in his arm isn't severe -- &quot;I'm aware of it; it'ssomething I think about when I'm pitching that I shouldn't have to&quot; -- and theTwins hope that rest is the only treatment needed.;    He was hit hard in hislast start, allowing seven runs on 11 hits in 6 1/3 innings in an 8-4 lossSaturday to the Chicago White Sox. Before Saturday, the 23-year-oldright-hander was unbeaten for more than two months.;    After losing his firsttwo starts, Erickson beat California on April 21 to begin a six-game winningstreak. He did not figure in the decision in an 11-inning loss to Texas on May23, then won his next six starts.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910703  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  330  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 3, 199100185179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
