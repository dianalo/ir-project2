It cited unidentified sources ``close to the rebel leadership''in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa. The Defense Ministry said ithad no information other than the report in Barricada, the officialnewspaper of ruling leftist party.   An estimated 11,000 of the rebels known as Contras, the bulk ofthe U.S.-supported force, are in Honduran camps in the border areawith their families.   In Honduras, Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras saidWednesday the rebel army should not be disbanded and its fightersrepatriated to Nicaragua until the Sandinista government fulfillsits promise of democratic reforms.   That implied a longer period for dismantling the rebel force andgreater linkage to reforms in Nicaragua than suggested by anagreement the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,Honduras and Nicaragua signed Feb. 14.   Lopez Contreras urged the United States to continue humanitarianaid to the Contras while they remain in Honduras.   ``An armed group devoid of humanitarian assistance andconcentrated on our border is a great danger to the security ofHonduras,'' he told a news conference.   The rebels are in the border province of El Paraiso in camps nearYamales, about 280 miles from Tegucigalpa.   A $27 million U.S. humanitarian aid package runs out March 31.Some members of Congress have proposed linking more aid, whichPresident Bush says he will request, to the Central American summitagreement. The United States halted military aid in February 1988.   Central American presidents agreed at the February 13-14 summitin El Salvador to develop a plan for dismantling the Contra forceand repatriating its members or relocating them, presumably outsidethe region.   They called for international verification of the accord, whichcontains provisions for early elections and democratic reforms inNicaragua.   Morris Busby, special U.S. envoy to Central America, met withLopez Contreras and President Jose Azcona Hoyo on Tuesday night andtold them the United States wants the Contras to return toNicaragua, the foreign minister said.   ``Repatriation would benefit the Contras,'' Lopez Contreras said.``It would benefit Nicaragua because it could achieve democracy asthe condition for repatration. And Honduras wouldn't have any morearmed groups or Nicaraguan refugees in its territory. So everyonewins.''   Barricada said Tuesday the Contras were moving deeper intoHonduras to avoid detection by international observers, who have notyet been deployed. Contra leaders in Miami denied the report.   On Wednesday, the paper said 6,000 Contras commanded by formerCol. Enrique Bermudez had moved out of the jungle camps to strategicpoints on the border.   It said they were preparing for ``offensive actions'' againstNicaraguan targets, not demobilization. The Contras have not agreedto the summit demobilization plan.   Bermudez said during the summit that some rebels might return toNicaragua and continue the war even without U.S. military aid.   The Contras and Sandinistas signed a temporary cease-fire a yearago and comparatively little fighting has been reported since.</TEXT></DOC>
