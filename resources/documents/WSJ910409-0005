Today's butchers, he says,offer up skinny sirloins, tremulous T-bones and pork chops sounporcine that they look like rejects from a singles bar athappy hour.   McDonald's plans to go national this month with a low-fatseaweed-and-beef concoction called the McLean Deluxe wonnutritionists' cheers. Mr. Burnham says the burger giantMcKnuckled under to anti-fat fanatics.</LP><TEXT>   America's war on fat has fat on the run, all right. Itsretreats and defeats litter the food chain. &quot;LOW FAT&quot; labelsdangle like surrender flags on supermarket shelves. &quot;FATFREE&quot; declarations invite consumers into entire liberatedzones of adipose-less edibles.   But isn't this good news? Not to Frank Burnham. For 20years, he's been one of fat's quixotic defenders as editorand publisher of Render, the National Magazine of Rendering,the bimonthly bible of meat industry byproducts. Animal fat,he says, is the much-maligned victim of vegetable oilpropagandists. Fat isn't the problem, he says. Abuse of fatis the problem.   &quot;Look, we have been consuming entirely too much fat inthis country, and we need to reduce fat intake across theboard,&quot; says the cheery, 67-year-old Mr. Burnham, who standssix feet tall and tips the scales at 240 pounds. &quot;But we feelthere's a place for animal fat.&quot;   Mr. Burnham goes to bat for fat in every 30-page,four-color issue of Render, which he puts together in hisCalimesa, Calif., home under the auspices of the NationalRenderers Association (NRA), the industry's Washington-basedtrade group.   About 7,000 copies go out free to the people who makeprofit off fat: rendering plant operators, meat packers andothers associated with rendering in a dozen countries.Renderers produce beef fat called tallow, pork fat calledlard and other fats and protein meals from meat, poultry andfish industry leftovers. Sure it's preaching to the choir,Mr. Burnham says, but the choir needs inspirational sermonsthese days: Fat's profits are thinning. And when renderershave a bone to pick, they know Render magazine will pick it.   Last fall, for example, McDonald's, Burger King andWendy's began replacing beef fat with vegetable oil in theirfrench fry cookers. Those three chains had gobbled up 30% ofU.S. edible tallow production. Render said the chains &quot;turnedtheir backs on pure edible beef tallow after 50 years of fastfrying&quot; just when &quot;new research indicates vegetable oils maybe far worse for the human system than animal fats were heldto be.&quot;   Nonsense, says Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition forthe Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington,D.C. &quot;There is no question in the minds of any scientists Iknow that animal fats are worse for you than vegetable oils,with the exception of tropical oils,&quot; she says.   In the face of such assaults, Render tries to keepindustry morale up with headlines such as &quot;More Good News forBeef Lovers: And That Means Good News for the Renderer.&quot; Butit isn't easy. The $2 billion-a-year rendering industry isbesieged, even though America would be hardpressed to dowithout it.   Renderers, going back to ancient Egypt, were among theworld's first recyclers. Without the 350 or so renderingplants left in the U.S., landfills would both bulge andsmell. The meat industry generates enough inedible meatbyproducts in a year to build a tower of fat, bones, viscera,hide and feathers 10 feet across and four and half mileshigh, Mr. Burnham says. That's because only 58% of, say, aslaughtered beef steer is used for food.   Renderers gather 36 billion pounds of what's left annuallyand either recycle it back into the food chain for people andanimals, or turn it into industrial raw materials &quot;withoutusing a penny of public tax money,&quot; Mr. Burnham notes.   They produce 18 billion pounds of products: edible andinedible tallow, lard, meatmeal, bonemeal, bloodmeal andfeathermeal. It's fed to chickens, put in pet food. It goesinto a wide range of lubricants, lipsticks, paints, inks,cosmetics, plastics, tires and emulsifiers. (Feathermeal,made from the feathers of some of the six billion chickensand turkeys slaughtered annually, is the chic protein of themoment. It's sprayed with recycled fat and fed back to newgenerations of food birds and animals.) American beef tallowis added to lean, imported ground beef to give burgers madefrom it an &quot;American taste.&quot;   But prices for these recycled fats and proteins havedropped so low that renderers who used to pay for meatleftovers and old restaurant grease increasingly charge shopsand restaurants to haul it away. Restaurants, unwilling topay, are increasingly, and usually illegally, dumping theirleftover grease down sewers, clogging them and creating havocat sewage treatment plants.   Animal fats are simply &quot;not welcome in domestic foodproduction,&quot; writes K.R. &quot;Dick&quot; Ellis, a former fat buyer forProctor andamp; Gamble who is a columnist for Render. Domesticdemand for beef fat is less than half of what it was fiveyears ago. Lard sales are so low that the U.S. Department ofAgriculture stopped keeping figures.   The rest of the world gobbled up about 2.5 billion poundsof American-exported fat last year. Mexico is the biggestcustomer.   There are a few tiny signs of a comeback for &quot;natural,&quot;tallow-based soaps. But at the moment, tallow's use in soapsis at a 45-year low.   Animal fat's biggest potential villain is a Proctor andamp;Gamble product called Olestra, an indigestible non-caloricfat substitute with many uses including deep frying. Renderderides it as &quot;fake fat.&quot; It still needs Food and DrugAdministration approval, which could take years. But, saysRender, &quot;Wide use of a non-caloric deep frying fat could allbut destroy the industry's single largest market.&quot;   Render isn't afraid to lard its readers with praise. &quot;Therendering guy has always been looked down upon and on theback street,&quot; says Mr. Burnham. For one thing, renderingplants stink. &quot;Traditionally, they've gotten as far away frompeople as possible, just like airports. But builders builtright up to edge, and then people complain about noise, orthe smell.&quot; But the plants don't emit hazardous wastes. &quot;Arose is a rose is a rose. It's in the nose of the beholder,&quot;says Mr. Burnham. &quot;You can live downwind of rendering plants.They're non-hazardous.   &quot;But they make major contributions to society,&quot; Mr.Burnham says. It was, he says, an &quot;invisible industry&quot; untilWest Coast renderers asked Mr. Burnham to start the magazinein 1972, after careers as newspaperman, Air Force informationofficer and aerospace writer. Now, when he isn't defendingfat, he's operations director of the California Civil AirPatrol.   Render is non-profit. The NRA puts up the working capital,but the magazine must break even annually. That means relyingon ads, many of which are for &quot;odor abatement equipment.&quot; Onead compares the Mona Lisa to the Svaertek Prebreaker, whichpromises &quot;to solve your raw material crushing and grindingproblems once and for all.&quot;   Ask him and Mr. Burnham will wax about fat's heroic past-- when housewives saved it and Boy Scouts collected it forthe war effort against the Nazis and Japanese; how stearicacid from it makes a great lubricant for extruding artilleryshells and bullets.   Fat helped America when it was down. Someday soon, Mr.Burnham expects America to return the favor.</TEXT></DOC>
