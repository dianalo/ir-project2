<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-0345 </DOCNO><TEXT>Although the technology associated with traditional low-temperature superconductivity(LTS) materials is relatively mature, the scientific foundations forthe newly discovered high temperature superconducting (HTS) materialsare in a more-rudimentary state, and the engineering parameters requiredfor definition of possible realms of exploration are largely unknown.Within the limitations imposed by these unknown factors, this documentsets forth a menu for a five-year Department of Defense SuperconductivityResearch and Development (DSRD) program. The goal of this program isto assure that the potential of HTS is realized at the earliest opportunityfor military applications, including both small- and large-scale applications.</TEXT></DOC>
