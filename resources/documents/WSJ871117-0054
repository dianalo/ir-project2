Prices of long-term Treasury issues advanced by about three-eighths of a point, or around $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. But trading volume was sluggish as dealers awaited details of the lengthy budget negotiations between Reagan administration officials and congressional leaders.    &quot;Right now, the government market is a captive of the budgetary process,&quot; said Alfred G. Roth, senior vice president at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. &quot;Nobody is willing to make a substantive commitment until we see something definitive coming out of Washington on the budget.&quot;    The seemingly never-ending budget talks failed to produce an agreement yesterday. However, White House and congressional negotiators have said they are optimistic about reaching a compromise accord of roughly $30 billion before Friday, when across-the-board cuts are scheduled to go into effect under the Gramm-Rudman law.    &quot;If we don't get a deficit reduction of $30 billion or more, it's not going to sit well with investors,&quot; contended Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. in San Francisco.    Mr. Maude, speaking at a luncheon with clients and reporters here, predicted that investors would react &quot;much more positively&quot; to a deficit-reduction plan coming mainly from government spending cuts, rather than tax increases. This view is shared by numerous other investment strategists, including some who fear Congress will rely too heavily on tax increases and trigger a deep economic slump.    Some analysts say a large budget-reduction accord might encourage the Federal Reserve System to drive down short-term interest rates further. But Fed officials haven't provided any assurances, and several economists argue that the Fed can't afford to ease credit any more because such a move might prove inflationary.    Manuel Johnson, the Reserve Board's vice chairman, said yesterday the Fed, which eased credit in the wake of the stock market collapse Oct. 19, must be ready to pull back &quot;if and when things return to normal.&quot; Answering questions after speaking to a conference sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank, Mr. Johnson also strongly defended the central bank's tightening of monetary policy before Oct. 19.    Although some analysts accused the Fed of tightening credit too much earlier this year, Mr. Johnson said such a move was needed to counter rising inflationary expectations. In addition, he said that confidence appears to be returning to the nation's credit markets and that it's too soon to measure any fallout from the market plunge on the economy.    Mr. Johnson said in his speech that &quot;it appears that to date, the Fed has been able to accommodate the strong liquidity demands that have developed&quot; since the stock plunge. Immediately after the crash, the Fed moved to increase substantially the funds available to financial institutions.    After his speech, Mr. Johnson explained that a central bank must take an &quot;elastic&quot; approach to policy in the wake of such an event, meaning &quot;it must be prepared to withdraw liquidity&quot; if the situation demands it. But, as usual, he wouldn't discuss current monetary policy or make any forecasts of when the Fed might change its strategy.    Mr. Johnson insisted that the Fed's tightening of monetary policy before Oct. 19 wasn't responsible for the stock market drop. &quot;I certainly don't believe it (the market's huge decline) was associated with monetary policy,&quot; he said, arguing that tighter credit was needed to counter rising inflationary expectations at the time. In retrospect, some administration officials believe the Fed erred in raising its discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, to 6% from 5.5% on Sept. 4. At the time, the Treasury supported the move.    Mr. Johnson made it clear he hasn't changed his mind. He contended that rising commodity prices and long-term bond yields and a weakening dollar were all signs of rising fears of inflation at the time and had to be dealt with promptly. &quot;The point is, if you don't deal with inflationary expectations, you can't expect to be credible&quot; in fighting inflation, he said. &quot;It would be hard to argue that these modest actions . . . were a source of instability.&quot;    He acknowledged that investors may have had &quot;some concern&quot; over credit-tightening moves by central banks in other countries, but said &quot;our own unilateral actions were justified.&quot; He noted that the Fed emphasized that it didn't think the market's fears of price acceleration were justified.    Mr. Johnson said a narrowing of the yield differentials between Treasury securities and riskier financial instruments suggests that market &quot;confidence is being restored.&quot; But he said the spread remains wider than before the crash, suggesting that the situation hasn't totally returned to normal.    Mr. Maude of Midland Montagu said the Fed probably will leave policy essentially unchanged until the middle of next year. &quot;I don't think we'll see a discount-rate cut unless we get another major move downward&quot; in stock prices, he said.    &quot;My view is that any impact (from the stock market's Oct. 19 debacle) probably won't be reflected in the economy until the first half of 1988,&quot; he said. He contended that the economy will expand this quarter at about a 3% to 3.5% annual clip, after adjusting for inflation. He sees little or no expansion in next year's first quarter, followed by a 2% growth clip in the final three quarters of the year. He also expects long-term interest rates to drop sharply in the first half of next year and then bounce back up in the second half.    &quot;If we get a credible deficit-reduction package, I see a chance that 30-year Treasurys will make a run at 8% to 8 1/4%&quot; by next spring, down from 8.90% now, Mr. Maude said. However, by the end of next year, he expects the yield on these issues to reach about 9 1/2% to 10%.    Among the major developments in the credit markets yesterday:    --The price of the latest 30-year Treasury bond rose to 99 22/32 from 99 9/32 last Friday. Its yield declined to 8.90% from 8.94%.    --The latest 10-year Treasury notes increased to 100 14/32 from 100 4/32, while the yield dipped to 8.81% from 8.86%.    --Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds climbed 4.26 points to 1252.03. The index hovered in an unusually narrow range. The high was 1253 and the low was 1248.01.    --The latest three-year Treasury notes wound up little changed, yielding about 8.01%.    --Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills sold yesterday by the government were higher than at the previous week's auction. The average rate on new 13-week bills increased to 6.01% from 5.74% last week, while the average on new 26-week bills increased to 6.33% from 6.24%.    --The federal funds rate surged, averaging 7.15% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was up from Friday's average of 6.80%. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.68% in the week ended last Wednesday. Several analysts agreed that the higher funds rate yesterday was caused by temporary technical factors and that the rate will drop back down to the 6 3/4% level soon.    In the municipal market, the volume of new bond issues expected soon remains extremely light. This has been a horrendous year for municipal bond dealers and underwriters, mainly because of congressional curbs on tax-exempt issuance. The situation has gotten even worse lately because of uncertainty about possible new limits that might be approved by White House and congressional negotiators.    In the short-term end of the municipal market, New York City officials said yesterday the city will sell up to $325 million of notes sometime between Nov. 24 and Dec. 15. The notes will mature June 30 of next year. The offering, which an official said is designed to meet the city's &quot;seasonal financing needs,&quot; will be a competitive sale.    New York City plans to sell a maximum of $225 million of revenue anticipation notes, backed by state aid payments, plus a maximum of $100 million of tax anticipation notes, which are backed by real estate taxes, according to a city spokesman.    The exact size of the note sale will be set by &quot;cash flow projections shortly before bids are solicited,&quot; according to a statement issued by the city comptroller, Harrison J. Goldin. The timing will depend on market conditions. Bidders will be given 24 hours to submit bids for amounts in excess of $25 million.    Here are details of the government's regular weekly auction yesterday of shortterm Treasury bills:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                13-Week           26-Week    Applications ......... $29,637,315,000   $21,985,715,000    Accepted bids ........  $6,427,475,000    $6,401,875,000    Accepted at low price              10%               78%    Accepted noncompet'ly      952,520,000       749,355,000    Average price (Rate)    98.481 (6.01%)    96.800 (6.33%)    High price (Rate) ....  98.483 (6.00%)    96.820 (6.29%)    Low price (Rate) .....  98.478 (6.02%)    98.795 (6.34%)    Coupon equivalent ....           6.20%             6.65%   Both issues are dated Nov. 19.
