Congress and a growing number of states are moving to toughen employers' obligations to workers who leave to have or care for a child, and businesses -- especially small ones -- are up in arms.    Already this year, proposals for family- or medical-leave legislation were introduced in at least 26 states, according to the Women's Legal Defense Fund. And six states -- Louisiana, Oregon, Minnesota, Tennessee, Connecticut and Rhode Island -- have passed laws this year specifically addressing maternity or parental leave. Some type of maternity-leave protection was already required in 11 other states.    The recent flurry of activity follows a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in January. The court upheld a nine-year-old California statute that requires employers to grant women disability leave for pregnancy and childbirth and to guarantee to reinstate them in the same or similar jobs.    Parental leave is &quot;still a very new issue,&quot; says Meryl Frank, director of the infant-care leave project at the Yale Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy. However, she adds, &quot;this has moved much faster than we ever thought it would.&quot;    The scope of the states' legislation ranges from limited pregnancy-disability leave for mothers, as in the law enacted in Tennessee, to such measures as those in Oregon's new law, which calls for up to 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child. (Parental leave applies to both men and women.)    Congress is considering measures that would require businesses to offer family- and medical-leave plans, including time off to care for seriously ill children. A House proposal also would provide for leave to care for ill parents.    Proponents say such legislation is needed to help parents balance the competing demands of work and home, and is long overdue. More women -- especially new mothers -- are working outside the home than ever before, they note, and fathers are beginning to play a larger role in child rearing.    According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 52.6% of married women with children under a year old are employed, more than double the percentage in 1970. Yet it is estimated that more than 60% of working mothers have no paid maternity leave, and parental leave is even less available.    Advocates argue, too, that they aren't seeking anything extraordinary. The federal proposals are &quot;extremely modest legislation,&quot; says Sheila Kamerman, chairman of the department of social work at Columbia University. &quot;We're talking unpaid leave. I'm startled at the lobbying by businesses, and that there is any debate at all.&quot;    However, the very idea of lawmakers' mandating parental leave upsets many small-business owners. They say the measures will be expensive and disruptive and will curtail their flexibility.    Susan Andrews, a board member of the National Federation of Independent Business who owns a development company in Nashville, Tenn., has lobbied vigorously against her state's maternity-leave measure -- even though she, like many other federation members, is exempt from both the Tennessee and proposed federal measures, which target only larger firms. The federation has mounted an intense national campaign to fight such measures.    &quot;Governments' mandating what employers must do is very dangerous to the competitiveness of our companies,&quot; she says, arguing that such measures would soon be extended to smaller firms.    Some big businesses have similar objections about the mandatory nature of the plans. Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. and BP America are among numerous large concerns to have joined the Concerned Alliance of Responsible Employers, a lobbying group that opposes mandatory benefits.    The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been equally adamant in battling the federal legislation, and told Congress its proposals would cost $16.2 billion a year. After widespread criticism that the figure was too high, the Chamber conceded the estimate presumed a worst-case scenario, and offered an estimate of $2.6 billion annually for more moderate use of parental-leave privileges. The General Accounting Office says both estimates seem greatly inflated.    &quot;The cost isn't the centerpiece of our opposition,&quot; responds Virginia Lamp Thomas, a labor-relations lawyer for the Chamber who says the estimate was demanded by the government. &quot;We're saying Congress shouldn't be playing the ultimate personnel manager. Whenever that happens, it's done with such a broad brush, from small to large employers, that it's unworkable.&quot;    Many employers regard required parental leave as part of a worrisome trend toward required benefits, such as mandatory health insurance. And while the laws thus far call for unpaid leave, employers fear that paid-leave benefits are the next logical step.    But even unpaid-leave laws would take a toll, they say. &quot;There's no one in our business we can give 90 days off and not be really hurt,&quot; says Jan Bovee, who employs 20 people at Rainbow Furniture Manufacturing Inc. in Salem, Ore. &quot;Hiring someone to replace them requires start-up costs, and if you then lay that person off you have to pay their unemployment.&quot;    Employers also argue that benefit packages are a zero-sum equation, and that mandating one benefit hampers their flexibility in designing plans responsive to all employees. (The parental-leave law passed in Oregon this year tries to retain flexibility by exempting employers who offer &quot;cafeteria&quot;-style benefit packages that have options equal to the statute.)    Despite differences of opinion, legislators appear to be listening to what small businesses are saying.    In California, for example, where employers stridently opposed a parental-leave bill in the legislature, the measure was softened to provide unpaid rather than paid leave and to cover only businesses with at least 25 employees instead of a minimum of 15. However, the measure was recently vetoed by the governor.    Meanwhile, a House family- and medical-leave bill was modified two weeks ago to exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees instead of fewer than 15, as originally drafted (after three years, however, the threshold could drop to 35 if Congress takes no further action). The changes also pared the maximum family leave to 10 weeks from 18, and excluded companies' highest-paid employees, if firms can demonstrate a business necessity. Moreover, the bill calls for a study of the effects of the law on small business.    &quot;My concern was that we not only have a bill that recognizes working families' problems in contemporary society, but also takes into consideration the impact on small business,&quot; says Rep. Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican who negotiated the compromise bill.    A House committee is expected to vote on the measure within several weeks. A final Senate subcommittee hearing on the issue is set for Oct. 29.    ---                Giving Time Off for Childbirth    A comparison, according to company size, ofmaternity-leave benefits.
