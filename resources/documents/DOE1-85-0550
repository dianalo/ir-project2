To provide an answer the present study utilized exercisethallium imaging as a guide to the performance of angioplasty in 85 patientswith multivessel coronary disease. Preangioplasty exercise thallium imaginghelped to identify the primary stenosis (culprit lesion) in 93% of patients.Two weeks to 1 month after dilation of this lesion, repeat thallium imagingidentified two patient groups: Group 1, 47 patients with no evidenceof ischemia in a second vascular distribution and Group 2, 38 patientswith evidence of further angioplasty. In Group 2 47% of patients hadangioplasty of a second vessel and 79% required multivessel angioplastyat 1 year follow-up. In contrast, only six Group 1 patients (13%) requiredangioplasty of a second vessel at 1 year. Thus, incomplete revascularizationmay be an acceptable approach in many patients with multivessel coronarydisease. Stress thallium-201 imaging may be a useful technique in theevaluation and management of these patients.</TEXT></DOC>
