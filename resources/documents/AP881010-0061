(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A divorced father is helping to make amovie about his seven-year custody-visitation battle over hisdaughters, but the girls' mother has gone to court in hopes ofstopping what she sees as exploitation.   Don Chavez, president of the National Congress for Men inWashington and founder of the Albuquerque-based Dads AgainstDiscrimination, said the movie will be about ``Dad trying to regaina meaningful place in the lives of his children.''   The plot has a father organizing a group of other fathers in thesame situation in an attempt to change the way judges award custodyand visitation rights.   ``What fathers do not see coming is the reality of gettinglaundered from their children or emotionally amputated from theirchildren when they get divorced from their wives, and that's whathappened to me,'' Chavez said. ``And so the story starts with thatkind of a loving father who struggles for the better part of adecade to regain his status as a real parent.   ``A real parent does not mean being Uncle dad or a Disneylanddad who visits with his children on weekends.''   The girls' mother, Marilyn Chavez Newhouse, has asked stateDistrict Judge Robert Thompson to appoint a guardian to determineif the movie is in their best interest and to decide how to protectthem from future publicity.   Daughters Leticia, 13, and Michelle, 11, live with Chavez, 38, aBureau of Indian Affairs administrator, during the school year andwith their remarried mother during the summer.   Mrs. Newhouse contends in her petition that Chavez, who also hasremarried, failed to consult with her about ``the effect oradvisability of exposing the children to additional mediaexploitation.''   Chavez said Mrs. Newhouse won't communicate with him exceptthrough their attorneys. He said his daughters favor the idea of amovie.   Chavez would not say what production company is making the film,and said he's unsure when the movie will be ready because of delayscaused first by the writers' strike and now by the HollywoodTeamsters' strike.</TEXT></DOC>
