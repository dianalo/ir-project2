(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Beth FreedmanandM;Small developer Alpha Software Corp. has merged the power of a relationaldatabase with the ease of use of a menu-driven file manager in a new versionof its Alpha software, hoping to offer database users the best of bothworlds.andM;The Alpha Four software, announced last week, incorporates unique featuresthat let non-programmers build such sophisticated applications as accounting,inventory-control and invoicing systems, according to Richard Rabins,president of the Burlington, Mass., firm.andM;However, unlike traditional relational databases, which require programmingto create links between databases, Alpha Four lets users establishrelationships through menu selection.andM;Its predecessor, Alpha/three, is a flat-file manager requiring users to turnto database languages such as Ashton-Tate's dBASE III Plus to create advancedapplications, Rabins said.andM;Like Alpha/three, the new version is file-compatible with dBASE, allowing itto share data with any other dBASE program.andM;The principal relational type of feature in Alpha Four is a new ''sets''technique, Rabins explained.andP;  This capability allows as many as 10 relateddatabases to be linked in a set, which users can then query as if it were asingle database, he said.andM;''I can pull information from multiple databases into one report, which Icouldn't do before in Alpha/three -- I'd have to do it in dBASE,'' said BillSampson, a beta tester of Alpha Four and a PC coordinator at General ElectricCo. in Bloomington, Ill.andP;  ''Doing it in Alpha Four is easier because it'smenu-driven.''andM;''We plan to see how far we can push Alpha Four without doing anyprogramming, because then we can expose it to more users,'' said BennettLandsman, assistant director of office automation and microcomputing for theState of New Jersey, in Trenton.andM;Alpha Four's use of outlines to generate applications is another uniquefeature, according to Rabins.andM;Much like the familiar outlining technique used to create documents, thisfeature lets non-programmers produce custom applications by completing anoutline of the menus, submenus and procedures required for the application,he explained.andM;Alpha Four produces a working application from the menu outline and allowsusers to substitute their own menus for Alpha Four menus to customize theapplication further, Rabins said.andM;Alpha Four also boasts a new what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) reportwriter.andM;The report writer allows users to merge data from as many as 10 relateddatabases, and it can include 50 built-in functions for doing calculations,Rabins added.andM;The program is priced at $549; it will be available March 31.andP;  The cost forAlpha/three users to upgrade to the new version is $125.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
