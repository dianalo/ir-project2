<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-47-1078 </DOCNO><TEXT>The yields of /sup 111/In and of other indium radioisotopes produced weredetermined by semiconductor gamma spectrometry for bremsstrahlung ofthe maximum energy of 19 MeV. Its value was found to be 430 kBq.{mu}A/sup-1/.h/sup -1/.g/sup -1/ (/sup 112/Sn). Radiochemical purity of the /sup111/In preparation obtained from natural Sn was acceptable for nuclearmedicine 15 hours following In separation. It was significantly higherfor an enriched target. The prospects are outlined of the future productionof /sup 111/In and other radionuclides on microtrons in the CSSR. (author).2 tabs., 15 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
