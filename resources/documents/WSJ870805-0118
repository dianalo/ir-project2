At the same time, Mr. Mallick was angling for a stake in a partnership that aims to turn Fort Worth's historic stockyards area into &quot;the Williamsburg of the West&quot; with the help of federal funds earmarked for the city by Mr. Wright. Messrs. Wright and Mallick say there's nothing amiss in all this.    But these dealings threaten to mar the Texan's auspicious start as a strong Democratic leader of the House. The savings-and-loan controversy and the Mallick ties are reviving old questions about Mr. Wright's ethics and judgment, which Republicans see as an inviting target.    &quot;We currently have the least ethical speaker in the 20th Century,&quot; charges GOP backbencher Newt Gingrich of Georgia, citing a history of controversies.    Mr. Wright's finances improved markedly after he became majority leader in 1977. His once-skimpy net worth soared to as much as $899,997 in 1981, by his own accounting. Recent troubles in the Texas oil and real estate industries cut that to a maximum of $464,996 last year, but he still reported outside income of at least $129,764 and possibly as much as $291,758. (Mr. Wright isn't required to disclose income or assets in exact amounts, only broad ranges.) As House speaker, he earns $100,800 a year.    Mr. Mallick is responsible for much of Mr. Wright's financial success but says he has never asked the speaker for a favor. The speaker wouldn't discuss the matter but an aide says &quot;Mr. Wright has never used his official position nor exerted any influence with an agency of the federal government to achieve a financial benefit for himself.&quot;    The speaker's ventures with Mr. Mallick paid him a minimum of $17,502 last year, the congressman's financial reports show. Last year they sold their interest in the &quot;BMW Drilling Fund,&quot; which held a 1/32nd interest in 16 oil wells. Mr. Mallick says, &quot;It earned some dough and we got some tax advantages,&quot; but says it wasn't as profitable as hoped.    The speaker values at more than $100,000 his stake in their remaining joint company, Mallightco, a name that blends the two families' surnames. The company has recently done &quot;very well&quot; importing rubies and other gemstones, Mr. Mallick says, and also invests in publicly traded stocks of regional companies.    The closely held company remains something of a mystery. Incorporated by the two men and their wives in 1979, Mallightco doesn't have to disclose its dealings. Instructions issued by the House Ethics Committee, however, tell members to disclose underlying holdings of such investment corporations but Rep. Wright doesn't. &quot;He isn't much interesting in doing that,&quot; an aide says. This wasn't always Mr. Wright's attitude. In the 1960s he voluntarily made public his income-tax returns, and in 1975 he wrote that all lawmakers should be required to do the same. He declined a request to release his 1986 returns, however.    The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, in one of several stories about Mr. Wright's ties to Mr. Mallick, disclosed that the speaker used a two-bedroom, garden apartment owned by Mr. Mallick as his Fort Worth residence, without paying rent. Mr. Wright now pays about $20 a day in rent when he is in Fort Worth, Mr. Mallick says. The speaker's wife, Betty, drew a salary from Mallightco for researching some real estate transactions that didn't pan out, and Mr. Mallick says the rent-free apartment was then part of her compensation.    The Star-Telegram also reported Mr. Mallick's involvement with &quot;Stockyards 85,&quot; a partnership planning for federally aided development of an area where it owns 102 acres. Mr. Mallick says he and a son were promised 27% of a new corporation that would take over the financially troubled partnership if he could locate $100 million or more in private financing. That transaction fell through a few days ago, he says, but he says he still stands to gain a finder's fee if loan arrangments can be completed with some Europeans.    Mr. Mallick's involvement raised eyebrows because the developers envision benefits from $11.8 million that Mr. Wright earmarked for the area in two federal money bills. In June, a Reagan administration official denounced the project publicly because the grant would be more than 20 times larger than the average economic development grant, and would bypass the normal requirement that the city pay a share. &quot;The folks at the Fort Worth Stockyards didn't even know what they wanted the money for,&quot; said the official, Orson Swindle, head of the Economic Development Administration. &quot;It simply is not right.&quot;    Fort Worth hasn't applied for the money yet. The developers' plans once included a 10,000-seat amphitheater, with 70 private sky boxes, which Mr. Mallick says the developers hoped the city would build on their land using federal funds. That idea was dropped about three months ago and now the developers envision a &quot;fetitval market&quot; selling Western gear to tourists. &quot;I think they would use part of the (federal) grant funds and part private money,&quot; Mr. Mallick says. Mr. Wright's aides say he wouldn't get any financial benefit from the project in any case, whatever his business partner's involvement. And Mr. Mallick says the main idea is to improve the city: &quot;Although I am out of it, this is a civic project.&quot;    Mr. Wright has a history of such controversies. In 1977, for example, he used more than $98,000 in political donations to pay personal debts, taking advantage of a loophole in House rules. That loophole was later tightened to prohibit personal use of campaign money by House members. In addition, it is now a violation of federal law for members who took office after 1979 to convert campaign funds to personal use. Mr. Wright's aides said that a Washington tax lobbyist, J.D. Williams, pointed out the loophole to Mr. Wright and helped him raise the money.    And in 1979 Mr. Wright, as majority leader, lobbied the U.S. and Egyptian governments trying to save the Sinai Peninsula investments of a Fort Worth oilman, Monty Moncrief, who allowed him to buy into two East Texas oil wells at about the same time.    Now his partner Mr. Mallick is helping shape his attitude toward federal Sandamp;L regulators. Mr. Mallick, in telephone interviews, says the speaker asked him to organize a small luncheon to hear complaints from developers and Sandamp;L officials last October at the Ridglea Country Club in Fort Worth. &quot;It got all over the state, and we ended up with more than 150 people there,&quot; he says.    They flocked to complain directly to Mr. Wright that federal regulators were being too zealous. Some accused Federal Home Loan Bank officials of using &quot;Gestapo tactics.&quot; Subsequently, according to Mr. Mallick and others, Mr. Wright summoned the Bank Board's chairman, Edwin Gray, to his office to relay the complaints, made calls to Mr. Gray on behalf of insolvent Sandamp;Ls run by Democratic campaign contributors, and pushed for legislation to rein in regulators.    He even summoned civil-rights experts from the Judiciary Committee to discuss whether a case could be made that Republican regulators were illegally persecuting Democratic developers and thrifts, according to a House staff employee.    Mr. Mallick says he prepared for the speaker a confidential, 25-page report on the Sandamp;L industry that blames its problems on bad economic conditions rather than the fraud or mismanagement alleged by federal regulators. It also faults regulators for bearing down too hard. &quot;They were just trying to foreclose, foreclose, foreclose,&quot; he says. &quot;It was just making the property values fall.&quot; Mr. Mallick has substantial property holdings in the Fort Worth area. He says none are financed by thifts.    He says Texas deserves federal help, just as Congress aided Chrysler Corp. and New York City. He concedes that a number of Texas Sandamp;Ls were reckless and that bailing out the nation's thrift industry will be costly. &quot;It's in such a mess it's going to cost billions,&quot; he says. Fifty billion? &quot;It could easily be $50 billion. . . . Yes, the speaker realizes that,&quot; says Mr. Mallick, &quot;and he's worried about it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
