In Europe, prices of the U.K. benchmark North Sea Brent crude traded 35 cents higher, at $18.65 a barrel. Brent prices have been rising because one buyer that had bought heavily -- betting incorrectly that prices would rise after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in December -- has purchased and is now &quot;sitting on&quot; most of the January-delivery Brent cargoes, analysts said.    By putting this so-called squeeze on the market, the buyer can drive up prices and make some of its lost money back.    The squeeze involves as much as 18 million barrels of oil, estimated Nauman Barakat, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. Another analyst said the squeeze will probably last until the end of the week, although some effects of it will spill over to the February Brent market.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude-oil rose 16 cents, to $17.85 a barrel. But even with crude's strength based on the Brent squeeze, heating oil &quot;led the market,&quot; said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Responding to freezing temperatures, and thus the perceived demand for heating oil, futures prices rose 0.83 cent, to 53.59, adding to a 2.77-cent gain made Monday.    &quot;Heating oil has been the main show the last couple of days,&quot; said James Ritterbusch, vice president, energy futures, at PaineWebber Inc., Chicago.    While heating oil's rally is weather-induced, Mr. Ritterbusch said, crude oil, even without the weather, would be getting support from the Brent squeeze.    The Brent squeeze is possible, other analysts explained, because oil companies and traders are buying less than they had contracted for from OPEC countries, and are scrambling to find oil on the spot, or non-contract, market.    Oil at official OPEC prices, based on an $18-a-barrel benchmark, has lately been too expensive relative to the spot market. Analysts say there are indications many OPEC countries won't offer discounts from those official prices.    David T. Mizrahi, editor of the MidEast Report newsletter, New York, had another theory for this week's oil rally. He said Saudi Arabia's now-scuttled plan, announced two days ago, to impose an income tax on foreign workers has been viewed as bullish by some traders because it shows the kingdom needs money and thus won't let oil prices fall.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Prices rose after their sharp drop the session earlier, partly on &quot;bargain hunting&quot; in world markets by investors attracted to lower-than-expected gold and silver prices. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery regained $2.80 of the $8.10 it lost Monday, to close at $480.90 an ounce; silver jumped 37.5 cents to $6.845 an ounce. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum soared $8.30 to $504.60 an ounce. The stock market's strength this week &quot;took the edge off recession fears,&quot; which usually hold down metals prices, said Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc., New York.    STOCK INDEXES: A stronger dollar sent futures prices higher for the second consecutive session, although late afternoon profit-taking erased much of the gains, traders said. &quot;There's a good chance the market will be higher down the road, but people want to see it consolidate some first,&quot; said Gerald Walsh, a futures analyst with Refco Group Ltd., New York. Arbitrage-related program trading in the first hour sent stock and stock-futures markets sharply higher before they leveled off for most of the session prior to the afternoon sell-off. Bellwether Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures for March settlement closed 2.4 points higher at 259.8, after trading as high as 264 early in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16.25 to close at 2,031.5. &quot;There's still a lot of skepticism out there that doesn't turn to optimism quickly,&quot; said Peter Grennan, a Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. senior vice president.    COCOA: Prices rose on optimism that the International Cocoa Organization will be able to re-establish its buffer-stock buying program to absorb surplus supplies, which are creating pressure on prices. The March cocoa contract rose $44 to $1,884 a metric ton. The organization's producing and consuming members scheduled a meeting for next Wednesday through Jan. 15 in London to discuss the matter. One analyst said, &quot;In view of the ill-fated history of such meetings, there is little to be optimistic about.&quot; He referred to last December's meeting, when an apparent agreement collapsed because of renewed discord over minor points. Another analyst said the planned January session was constructive because the meeting was sooner than expected. &quot;But the differences are so great,&quot; she said. &quot;If they ever make it to the finish with a working agreement it will be a whole other story.&quot;    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat prices rose amid rumors that the U.S. Agriculture Department is mulling whether to subsidize additional sales of U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union, said Ted Mao, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York. The rumors are that an Agriculture Department official is meeting in London with Soviet officials and that this week the Soviets sent two chartered ships to U.S. grain ports in the Gulf of Mexico. Grain analysts said they wouldn't be surprised if the U.S. approves more subsidized sales to the Soviets. Agriculture Department officials have said they are anxious to work down big U.S. wheat stockpiles, and the Soviet Union has shown strong interest in U.S. wheat. It has bought about 4.8 million tons under subsidies since last fall, exceeding its obligation under a long-term trade agreement with the U.S. The Agriculture Department subsidizes overseas trade by compensating exporters which sell U.S. wheat to targeted countries at lower world prices. Prices were also elevated by speculation that frigid high winds in the Midwest could erode topsoil and expose the soft red winter wheat crop planted last fall, said Daniel Basse, an analyst at GNP Commodities Inc., Chicago. </TEXT></DOC>
