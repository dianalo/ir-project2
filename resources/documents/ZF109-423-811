(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>First off, let's get it clear in our heads what Interactive Voice Response(or IVR - lately one of the more murky terms being tossed about telecom) isand isn't.andP;  In a very basic nutshell, it's a voice processing applicationthat gives callers specific information based on unique information callershave given it.andP;  Thus, we're talking interactive communication, folks.andP;  Getit?andM;For example, let's run through one of the most common IVR applicationspopping up today - the bank-account query.andP;  A caller rings his/her bank up,after an initial auto attendant application (which routes the caller to thearea of the application he/she is interested in - say, checking-accountbalance check), the IVR system says touchtone in your checking account number(this is the unique part, everybody's number is different), the system thengoes to a computer (usually a big computer in this type of application),grabs the information based on the caller's input (which, Of course, isspecific to that individual) and gives it to the caller.andM;This interaction between caller and system makes IVR the highest end of voiceprocessing's application spectrum.andP;  It's not auto attendant, which simplyroutes callers based on touchtone information but doesn't give any Specificinformation (though press 1 for this and two for that is often used inconjunction with IVR).andP;  And it's not audiotex, which gives every caller thesame information.andM;We want to stress that last part.andP;  Audiotex and IVR are different, thoughwe're finding a lot of people are getting them mixed up.andP;  For instance, oneguy we talked to when we were Putting this feature together said, &quot;IVR? Sure!andO;Our system can do IVR.andP;  No problem.andP;  In fact, we just set up an applicationthat gives people their horoscopes in seven different languages  ..&quot;andM;We stopped him there.andP;  That's not IVR.andP;  That's auto attendant and audiotex.andO;Every Aries is going to route his/her astrological butt to the samerecording.andP;  Basically, audiotex is nothing more than souped up voice mailwithout the mail part.andP;  The voice processing system is merely broadcastingthe same recorded information to all callers.andM;In IVR, again, the machine is giving the caller different information basedon what the caller has given it.andP;  Obviously, then, we're talking accessingdatabases to a great extent.andP;  Consequently, it's damn tricky stuff, as you'llsee a little later, to set up from a system standpoint.andP;  But from an userstandpoint, it's a piece of cake.andM;The reason it's so simple for the user (and why this, technology is going togo boom in  90s, you can bank on it) is the phone, essentially, becomes a avery easy-to-use computer terminal in IVR.andP;  Granted, it's a somewhat limitedterminal, but it's also the most ubiquitous, nonproprietary, familiarterminal in the universe.andP;  Telephones! Why not let people use them to get atinformation? They're everywhere !andP;  So, too, it seems, are the applications.andM;We were explaining the technology to somebody the other day and she said, &quot;Ohyeah, my college has it.andP;  We can register for our courses.andP;  We just call up,enter our student number, it spells out our last name, we tell it if it hasit right, enter class codes, add or drop courses.andP;  It's great.andP;  They musteven have it hooked up to some sort of printer, because two days later youget your schedule in the mail.andP;  It's fantastic!&quot;andM;Using IVR,.andP;  people can get stock-market updates from a constantly refresheddatabase over the phone.andP;  Sports scores too.andP;  Order entry/order status can beautomated and done completely over the phone.andP;  Telephone directory assistancecan be given to callers without the need for breathing humans (punch in thename and get the number or vice versa).andP;  You can set up dealer locatorservices (wherein the caller bangs in his/her phone number or zip codes andgets the nearest dealer).andP;  Cable TV pay-perview can be totally automatedwithout the need for Julie the Manhattan Cable operator standing by.andM;We could even vote for our next president using IVR.andM;Please enter your social security number and voter registration number now.andO;Thank you.andP;  Press one for Cuomo/Bradley or press zero for Bush/Quayle (orwill it be Bush/Baker?).andP;  Thank you for being an American.andM;Who knows? Maybe our voting turnout would rise if we didn't force people toschlepp to the local high school and, heaven forbid, miss that BeverlyHillbillies rerun on TBS at 6:00.andP;  Theoretically, we could increase it, say,to an astonishing 40% to 45% (sarcasm, sadly, intended) !andP;  TO THE CHARTandM;Okay, you know where we're coming from as far as IVR now.andP;  Our next job, asis always the case with TELECONNECT, is to give you some information on theIVR systems available - what they have, what they can do and, mostimportantly, what their phone number is so you can call them to find out howmuch it really costs (Hint: This stuff doesn't come cheap, but if you'rereally thinking IVR you're probably a big company with lots of money tospend.andP;  Payback on one of these systems, though, is usually excellent).andM;We sent out a survey to all of the players we knew of (and then some).andP;  Theresults are listed in the following beautiful, albeit daunting, chart.andP;  Butbefore you plunge head-long into that fountain of information, we're going togo through each of the variables of the chart and explain, to an extent (thisstuff is complicated!), what it is and what it means to you.andM;Sorry, but you have to read this.andM;Configuration andamp; SystemandM;PriceandM;Phone line capacity: This gives the system's minimum and maximum number ofphone lines.andP;  Things to remember here.andP;  First, look for a nice overlap fromthe same maker's different systems, so you can grow the system easily.andP;  Makesure it will be able to meet your growth needs.andP;  Most people like to sticktheir toes in the water first in an IVR application, but they quickly becomehooked and dive right in.andP;  Like any piece of telecom hardware, make sure yourIVR system doesn't crap out on you as far as growth.andM;With IVR, a four-line system is usually the minimum.andP;  Anything under that andit's hard for the system to be cost effective.andP;  Here's why.andM;IVR systems replace people.andP;  Typically, one line equals one person's routinework in your company.andP;  Actually, it's more than that because it works 24hours a day, seven days a week.andP;  But use that as a benchmark.andP;  Meanwhile, theinitial software cost (it ain't cheap) for an IVR system is not really basedon the amount of lines.andP;  It's not linear.andP;  Generally, it's going to berelatively the same no matter how many lines in the system (to a point).andP;  Soif you're only replacing, say, two people, it's hard to get any kind ofdecent payback with the system, i.e.andP;  replacing two employees who make$15,000 a year with a $40,000 system.andM;Hours of Voice Storage: This gives minimum to maximum number of voice storagehours.andP;  This isn't nearly as important as it is, of course, in a voicemessaging system.andP;  You do need a minimum so you can take care of all thevoice prompts in the system, but it can be as low as 15 minutes.andP;  However, ifyou're integrating IVR with voice messaging it becomes much more important.andO;But with strict IVR, this isn't that important.andM;System Price: Estimated ball-park price range.andP;  Look at things in aprice-per-port format.andP;  Again, IVR replaces a person who does a routine tasklike handling the logistics of setting up a student's course schedule).andP;  Eachport equals roughly one person.andP;  Compare price-per-port againstprice-per-person.andP;  Host Computer InterfacesandM;Now we're into the way the IVR system actually interfaces with a computer.andO;The following are the most common ways people are doing it.andP;  Generally, IVRpeople emulate (mimic) things that already are interfacing with thecustomer's host computer.andP;  It gets very tricky, but this will at leastfamiliarize you with some of the methods.andM;Asynchronous RS-232 Interface (Single Port): This is the most commonnonproprietary interface going, of course.andP;  And that's good.andP;  It's also easyto use, easy and cheap to test and generally the simple way to go.andP;  Thatsimplicity makes it very flexible.andM;That's important because depending on what kind of host you're interfacingwith, the overall IVR system has to be very different.andP;  For instance, withthe previously mentioned bank-account query application, even though it'stransparent to the caller, the system is going to be completely different ifit's working off, say, a Tandem or an IBM mainframe.andP;  Asynch RS-232 usuallymakes it easy (relatively speaking) regardless of the host.andM;It's especially geared for Tandem computers, Stratus computers, DEC VAX, PCs(every PC comes with an RS-232 port) and LAN gateways among other things.andO;And it's generally the most cost effective way to accomplish IVR.andM;One other good thing about this interface is its ability to handle exoticrequirements.andP;  You can drive protocol converters to take care of weirdprotocols like Poll/Select, which is only used by Burroughs' Unisys, and X.25packet switched stuff Both of those are not common enough to write specialsoftware for, but with RS-232 you can easily get around them.andM;As an IVR interface, its shortcoming is its limitation as far as bandwidth.andO;It's limited to a data stream of 19.2 Kbps (though people will debate that).andO;That sounds big, but as far as IVR goes it's not.andP;  Thus, you can't grow thesystem that incredibly large.andP;  Ballpark estimate of how high you can grow thesystem is about 16 lines.andM;So, as an IVR interface, it wouldn't be good for Chase Manhattan and theirbank query system.andP;  They need a garden hose.andP;  This interface is more like astraw.andP;  It probably wouldn't be good for a large cable pay-per-viewapplication as well, because they take such big hits (everybody waits tillthe last possible minute before they decide to watch Revenge of the Nerds,Part 2).andP;  Even with enough phone lines, it's hard to handle high-trafficapplications with a single port RS-232 interface.andM;Multi-Port Asynchronous RS-232 Interface: It has the same benefits as above -common, cost effective, easy to use, etc.andP;  But it obviously has a biggercapacity and, thus, can handle more applications.andM;IBM 3174/3274 Cluster Controller Emulation: This interface is the mostefficient way to connect t6 the entire line of IBM mainframes.andP;  It'ssupported by all of them.andP;  There's a bunch.andM;Now IBM mainframes let people and terminals hang off of them.andP;  You know, likein a call center environment, with all those terminals and their accompanyinghuman beings tapping in caller information.andM;Well, those people are not actually hooked up directly to the mainframe.andO;They're connected to something called a cluster controller.andP;  Up to 32terminals can be hooked up to the cluster controller.andP;  The controller, inturn, is hooked up to the mainframe.andM;Among other things, the controller takes care of the presentation of data toand from the mainframe.andP;  It's kind of a concentrator, streamlining thecommunication between the terminals and the mainframe.andM;When an IVR system does cluster controller emulation, you literally unplugthe controller and plug in the IVR system.andP;  It mimics the controller and its32 terminals.andP;  Thus, instead of having 32 people punching in, say, airlinereservations, you have a single machine doing it.andP;  It's important that themachine apes exactly the way the people work at their terminals, even down tothe actual key strokes.andP;  That way you don't have to rewrite anything on themainframe side.andP;  It still thinks it's dealing with the cluster controller.andM;Yes, it's tricky.andP;  But they're doing it.andM;IBM 5251 Cluster Controller Emulation: This is for IBM's mid ranges (minis) -System 36, 38 and the newer AS/400.andP;  It's a smaller cluster controller,supporting up to eight terminals.andP;  Works pretty much just like above.andM;Local Area Network  LAN) Interface: The key here is looking like an actualnode in the network.andP;  But it's not just a matter of throwing a network cardinto the box.andP;  The IVR system can look like just another human workstation,so the old programs don't know it's not a human tapping in the thosekeystrokes.andM;This is a small application but it's growing fast.andM;IBM 3278 Terminal Emulation: This is one of those terminals that hangs off amainframe cluster controller.andP;  IVR makers can make their systems look likeone of these too.andP;  It's not the most efficient way to do things in regards tovolume, but it has its place.andP;  Could be cost effective in smallerapplications.andM;And some people don't know how to look like a cluster controller.andP;  Toocomplicated.andM;IBM 5250 Terminal Emulation: Same deal as above, just with their mid ranges.andM;Dumb TTY Terminal Emulation: This is a plain ASCII terminal (TTY stands forteletype).andP;  They were prevalent in the days of time share, but they're stillused a lot.andM;There's a small irony here.andP;  As a terminal for humans, TTYs are not userfriendly.andP;  But for IVR, they're very easy to emulate.andM;VIP 100/200 Terminal Emulation: These are DEC terminals, but a lot of peoplehave adopted this protocol, like Hewlett-Packard, because it's very popular.andO;They have a simple screen, not nearly as fancy as IBM.andP;  Kind of bare bones asfar as frills.andP;  Because of that, they are easy to emulate.andM;Interface to Multiple Host Computers Simultaneously: Often times in an IVRapplication, you'll need to interface with multiple hosts because the datayou need to get at resides on two or more different computers.andM;For example, a company is in the distribution business.andP;  They want toautomate order taking and they want people to pay with credit cards, both viaIVR.andP;  They handle the order information in-house on their IBM mainframe, butthey also want to run credit checks.andP;  To do that, they have to call anoutside number and find their way to some other far flung host.andM;It can get wild, one maker's customer we know is in the information servicebiz.andP;  They give callers stock quotes, sports scores, etc., etc.andP;  They get allthat information from a bunch of different computers and sources, evensatellites.andP;  It can get really bizarre.andM;Automatic Log On/Log Off/Keepahve Supported: Whenever you deal withmainframes, especially mainframes, you don't just walk up to it and say,&quot;Hey, idiot, give me a bank balance.&quot;andM;You have to identify who you are, go through several layers of passwordprotection and other security measures, find your way into a certainenvironment within the huge host and then get into a certain program orprograms before you're ready to give it information, like a bank accountnumber.andM;Furthermore, every time a computer goes down (we've all heard it, I'm sorry,our computer is down), you have to start from the beginning.andP;  Automatic logon streamlines all this.andM;You can't just turn off your machine either.andP;  There are steps to follow.andO;Auto log off gets you through all that.andP;  A lot of times it's just thereverse.andM;Keepalive is important.andP;  In periods of no activity, a lot of host computerswill throw you off after they see a period of inactivity, like at night whennot too many callers are accessing the IVR.andP;  Keepalive prevents this fromhappening.andP;  It sends something to the host, making it talk back to the IVRsystem so you don't get thrown offandM;Like a conscientious lover, it whispers sweet nothings to the host in themiddle of the night.andM;Alarm for Host Computer Down Condition: When the host goes down, this featuresends out an alarm.andP;  A lot of the time, the IVR system knows when the host isdown before anybody else.andP;  It can be an audible alarm or it could send out aremote alarm to, say, a technician.andM;Automatic Recovery from Host Computer Down Condition:andM;When a host computer goes down, you want to know the status of everything inyour system as it died.andP;  This feature goes in and verifies and/or resetsstatus according to what the IVR system needs.andM;It usually starts from the inside and works its way outside to log off.andP;  Whenit's sure everything's all right, it logs on again.andM;Pre/Post Processing on Host Computer Transmissions:andM;This is an important efficiency function.andP;  It allows the IVR system to addthings before or after the interaction with the host computer.andM;For example, pre processing could filter out stuff the host is sending theIVR system because it still thinks if s dealing with a human at a terminal.andO;It gets very complicated.andM;Database AccessandM;This is for getting at databases residing on the IVR system, not someuncaring, huge mainframe host.andP;  There are several reasons why you would wantto work from a database that's not actually on the host computer.andP;  Securityis a big one.andP;  Speed of processing is another.andP;  And a lot of times mainframesare not up 24 hours a day.andP;  Whatever.andP;  There are three major things to lookfor here.andM;Read Only Access to Database: You can only get information from the database.andO;You can't put anything into it.andP;  This is the simplest form.andM;Read/Write Access to Database: You can update the database.andP;  You can do thisbased on what's happening on the IVR system as well.andP;  This gets complicated.andM;In Memory File Support: In this mode, the data is held in RAM.andP;  Thus, there'sno seek time.andP;  It knows things instantly.andP;  Real, real fast.andP;  This allows yourapplication to rid itself of awkward pauses just so you can go checksomething.andM;Its importance is based on your application.andP;  For instance, a dealer locatorapplication, where the caller punches in his/her area or zip codes and getsthe nearest dealer, should be fast.andP;  In this mode, as soon as the callerbangs their information in, zip-zip, the system comes back with theinformation.andP;  Makes things more eloquent.andM;ProgrammabilityandM;The programmability of host computer interfaces and database access, ofcourse, is incredibly important in IVR Once you have the host connectivitydown, every IVR application is custom.andP;  This is where you tell the systemwhat information it needs to get and how to get it.andP;  This is where youcustomize.andM;High Level Programming Language such as C: This is the hardest.andP;  You needthis, however, to get down to the nitty gritty of an application sometimes.andO;It helps to accomplish something really weird.andM;Script Level Voice Processing Language: This makes things much easier to setup an application.andP;  But it's still not something a non-computer head canfigure out.andP;  But since it was created to work specifically in the voiceprocessing environment, it has many advantages over something like C.andM;Menu Driven Voice Processing Application Generator.andP;  The easiest.andP;  You'reguided through the application development process by making selections frommenus and by answering prompts.andP;  For instance, you tell it to grab thenumbers that appear in a particular place on the host computer screen and sayit to the caller as dollars and cents ...andP;  Bingo! Account balance inquiryandM;An IVR system should really have all three of the above.andP;  They each havetheir places.andP;  Again, the key is customizing the application to meet theexact needs of the user.andP;  You can't have a simple menu driven applicationgenerator that can cover every user's needs.andP;  So you need the other two aswell.andM;Voice mail &quot;RULES&quot;andM;These  rules' come from Tom Fermazin.andP;  Tom is a Fortune 500 telecom managersoured on voice mail.andP;  What can we do for him and others like him? Here arehis voice mail rules'- the editors.andM;1.andP;  You can always reach the wrong person - that is, the person you didn'twant to talk to.andM;2.andP;  (Corollary to rule number 1.) You can never reach the right person - theone you really need to talk to.andM;3.andP;  Everyone can say,  Leave a detailed message.&quot; But no one has figured outhow to do it yet.andM;4.andP;  All command of the English language ceases when someone tries to leave avoice-mail message.andM;5.andP;  Anyone who thinks voice mail eliminates 'telephone tag' also believesDick Tracy is a real person.andM;6.andP;  Beware of voice mail vendors bearing  solutions.' Make sure you know whatthe &quot;problems&quot; are first.andM;7.andP;  The term  integrate, as in -  &quot;This voice mail system will totallyintegrate with your present PBX' - is synonymous with the terms,  virtually,&quot;kind of and  You know what I mean,' etc.andM;8.andP;  MTBF (mean-time-between-failure) is a ludicrous term when applied tovoice mail systems.andP;  ANY time is a MEAN TIME for a voice mail system to FAILandM;9.andP;  The three lies of voice mail are: I'm away from my office right now,Please leave a message and I'll return your call shortly; and If you want totalk to someone who is taking calls for me, please dial..andM;10.andP;  Humans have approximately fifty-billion brain cells.andP;  Voice mail systemshave none.andP;  In spite of this, voice mail systems usually win out inhead-to-head competition.andM;A Nice Little HouseandM;King Hassan's new palace at Agadir, Morocco, was inaugurated on March third.andO;It is decorated with carved cedar-wood, gold leaf, marble and mosaic.andP;  Oneroom contains an 11-ton Venetian chandelier.andP;  Within the palace grounds liethree golf courses ...andP;  The royal pile reputedly cost $360 million.andP;  This ishis 10th palace.andP;  And he is building an 11th and a 12th.andM;Why so many?
