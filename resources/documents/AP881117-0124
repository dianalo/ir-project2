The Forest Service has identified 500 rivers in its 123 nationalforests that are eligible for protection and expects ``that at aminiumum 200 will be included,'' said Kevin Coyle of AmericanRivers, who said he was also speaking for George Leonard, associatechief of the Forest Service.   Frank Snell, chief of the recreation, wilderness and culturalresources division of the Bureau of Land Management, said his agencywas studying another 60 to 80 rivers on its lands. He did not sayhow many were expected to be recommended for protection.   Leonard's flight was delayed and he could not be at a newsconference sponsored by American Rivers, a conservation groupchiefly interested in preserving free-flowing rivers.   The Wild and Scenic River System was established by Congress 20years ago to preserve free-flowing rivers from damming, developmentalong their banks or other harm. So far only 119 segments totaling9,200 miles have been protected, of which 44 rivers and 1,429 milesin Oregon were mandated by a bill passed by Congress and signed byPresident Reagan last month.   The 9,200 miles are only 0.2 percent of the total U.S. riversystem. W. Kent Olson, president of American Rivers, said the groupestimates that 17 percent of the total has been dammed. ``We arequite hopeful that the Wild and Scenic System will quadruple overthe next 10 years,'' he said.   In President-elect George Bush and Secretary of State-designateJames Baker, We have a fisherman as president and a fisherman assecretary of state and things are looking up,'' Olson said.   Stewart L. Udall, interior secretary for Presidents Kennedy andJohnson, said he was preparing an open letter to Bush that wouldsay, among other things, ``If you are looking for things that don'tcost a lot of money, the wild rivers system is certainly acandidate.''   The letter will tell Bush he has the chance ``to preside over thepreservation of more miles of free-flowing rivers that all of yourpredecessors combined,'' Udall said.   In 1982 the National Park Service identified 1,524 river segmentstotaling 62,000 miles as worthy of study to see if they met thecongressionallly criterion of having ``outstandingly remarkable''features. Olson said it might take 50 years to bring that many underprotection.   For some years the service has been studying the idea of a``river park,'' protecting a river along its entire length. DeputyDirector Denis Galvin said the idea was still being considered for``a handful _ two or three'' rivers, but the service had not beenable to ``put together the right factors to make the proposalacceptable'' to all jurisdictions along the lengths of thecandidates.   He identified only one candidate, the Buffalo River in Arkansas.   While rivers are being studied, the Forest Service and the Bureauof Land Management impose a quarter-mile buffer zone on each bankwhere timbering, stock-watering and similar activities are banned.   But they cannot prevent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissionfrom granting licenses from small hydroelectric dams, favored by1978 legislation aimed at diversifying energy supplies. Thecommission grants about 200 licenses a year.   Olson said many Westerners saw protection as a ``river grab,''but ``rivers that are designated often act as an enhancer of localproperty values.''</TEXT></DOC>
