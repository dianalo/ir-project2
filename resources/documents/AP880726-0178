The five-year-old program, ordered by Congress, still is ``notadequate to assess'' whether the weapons will work in combat, thecongressional watchdog agency reported.   The GAO review centered on the Pentagon's Office of OperationalTest and Evaluation, which is headed by Jack Krings, a formerlobbyist for McDonnell Douglas. It was the second time in two yearsthe GAO had criticized the operation of the office.   Congress created the office in 1983 as part of an effort to do amore realistic job of testing weapons. The legislation wastriggered by the discovery of serious flaws in several majorweapons systems after they were well into development.   Among those weapons were the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle,which has been plagued with problems, and the Army's Sergeant Yorkgun, which was canceled because of poor performance, but not untilmore than $1.5 billion had been spent on it.   The GAO review looked at the testing of six new major weapons,including the Navy's Aegis air defense, the sophisticated trackingsystem that was involved in the July 3 shootdown by the Navycruiser Vincennes of an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf. ThePentagon says the shootdown was a case of mistaken identity.   The other weapons reviewed by the GAO included the Army's Aquiladrone plane; The Army's helicopter improvement program; NavyTomahawk conventional cruise missile; the newest targeting systemfor the Air Force Maverick missile; and the Air Force LANTIRNsystem for night-time targeting.   ``We found significant problems and limitations in the planning,execution, realism, analysis, and service test agency reporting ofthe six'' programs, the GAO said.   ``Some of these problems are limitations were unavoidable due totime, resource or safety constraints, although numerous others werenot,'' it said.   The report was released by the Congressional Military ReformCaucus, a group of 140 legislators created to seek Pentagonmanagement changes.   Members of the caucus told a news conference that Krings shouldquit. ``It's time for Mr. Krings to resign,'' said Rep. DennySmith, R-Ore., ``the sooner the better.''   At the Pentagon, spokesman Dan Howard said ``I haven't seen thereport. It is my understanding that GAO was instructed not tocontact DOD for its views on the matter. So we will have to waitand see.''   ``I have a comment in general terms,'' Howard added. ``I haveseen several of these stories recently put out by certaincongressmen ... The difficulty is that those who do not wish toinform themselves, who very carefully guard their ignorance,obviously are not going to learn about the details of our testingprograms.   ``The stories attacking the Aegis system that I saw in the pressby and large were four-year-old stories. They were based on anearlier phase of the Aegis testing program, in 1983, and subsequentto those tests and those reports, an additional $30 million worthof testing was done on Aegis and it performed magnificently inthose tests.''   Other Pentagon comment came from spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi, whosaid ``this attack on Mr. Krings is inappropriate and unjustified.... We feel that Mr. Krings is successfully carrying out theresponsibilities of his office.''   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., said, ``we need a back-to-basicsapproach to weapons testing. Approving a weapon that doesn't workis like graduating a high school student who can't read. It's easy,but it hurts everybody.''   Congress had ordered that testing be as realistic and close tocombat-type conditions as possible, but that wasn't done, the GAOsaid.   For example, ``the prevailing problem for operational users wasthat they were selected from an operator pool that was atypicallyhigh in skill or experience level _ that is, so-called `goldencrews,''' the review said.   Another example cited was the fact that in some case,contractors were permitted to help military crews maintain theweapons ``although that contractor support would not be availablein the field,'' it said.   When the test data was available, it was often wronglyinterpreted, the GAO said.   ``In five of six cases, we found problems with the variousassumptions underlying the analyses of the test data,'' it said.``In at least two cases, such assumptions led to overly optimisticestimates of the system's capability, one of which was contractedby available data.''   There were other ``questionable practices'' in interpreting dataand their impact ``was significant,'' the GAO said. ``Theyfrequently allowed a system to appear to meet its performancerequirements.''   Among the flaws cited by the report was the fact that crews usedfor both the Army helicopter tests and Maverick tests werespecifically trained for the tests, rather than being normal crews;and tests of the Tomahawk occurred only over pre-tested fightroutes.</TEXT></DOC>
