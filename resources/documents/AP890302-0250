What a surprise to realize it's only three hours long. ``DayOne'' airs on one day, Sunday, on CBS.   Certainly, a movie about the development of the A-bomb, theManhattan Project as it was called, sounded like it had a lot ofpotential _ the race against time, the dangerous testing, and mostimportantly, the deep moral questions about developing sodestructive a weapon.   Unfortunately, the script by producer David Rintels, based onPeter Wyden's book, ``Day One: Before Hiroshima and After,'' isdeadly dull.   To his credit, Rintels avoids pat answers and explores complexquestions _ was it really necessary to bomb Japan to end World WarII, or did Congress just want to see the bang that $2 billion worthof taxpayers' bucks had bought?   And Rintels refuses to junk up an inherently dramatic true storywith a lot of phony made-for-TV love interests and subplots.   It's just that it takes extremely good writing to turn historicalaccuracy into drama, especially when the story is mostly talk andlittle action.   It's also difficult following all the characters. Much of thestory winds through the Washington bureaucracy. A narration mighthave helped, eliminating the need for awkward, unlikely dialogue toexplain identities, such as, ``You're the supreme commander of theAllied forces that won the war. Of course, he'll care what youthink.''   The movie does boast an impressive cast, including Hume Cronynand Barnard Hughes in supporting roles. Brian Dennehy and DavidStrathairn do their level best with the two leads.   Dennehy plays Gen. Leslie Groves, a military disciplinarian incharge of the Manhattan Project, who had little use for scientistsstanding around all day kibbitzing about fission and implosion.   There is an interesting relationship between Groves and hisseeming opposite, the intellectual Dr. Robert Oppenheimer(Strathairn), who impresses the general with his bluntness. MichaelTucker is admirably sympathetic as Leo Szilard, the German scientistwho turned against the bomb that he was instrumental in creating.   But pair Rintels' script with Joseph Sargent's unimaginativedirection, and no acting can save scene after plodding scene oftalking heads spouting platitudes.   ``It's about our responsibility for the development of this mostterrible weapon by which modern civilization could be completelywiped out,'' Secretary of War Henry Stimson (Hughes) explains toPresident Harry Truman (Richard Dysart). ``But on the other hand, ifthe problem of proper use of this weapon can be solved, we'll havethe opportunity to save world peace and our civilization.''   Groves talks to Oppenheimer. Szilard talks to the secretary ofstate. Oppenheimer talks to Szilard. Oppenheimer and Groves talk tothe Cabinet.   This wordiness is relieved only occasionally when the scientistsat the research center in Los Alamos stand on a sand dune and blowup an iron pipe, then run over to examine it.   Rintels tries to build suspense leading up to the first testdetonation _ a potentially riveting moment _ with endless discussionof the weather, which is about as suspenseful as endless discussionof the weather.   When the first mushroom cloud ever ignites the desert sky, one ofthe scientists exclaims, ``It's brighter than a star!'' ``It'sbrighter than two stars!'' Groves adds.   The dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima is portrayed through use ofarchival footage. Then there is an almost-powerful scene when thescientists who developed the bomb and cheered its success see slidesof the devastation it has wrought. But by then, unfortunately,viewers will be too bored to be moved.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   BE STILL OUR HEARTS _ And mark our calendars.
