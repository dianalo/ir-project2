JohnWarner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, prior to final passage of the legislation.   By a vote of 95-4, the Senate approved its version of thedefense authorization bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 _ ablueprint that bears no resemblance to House legislation thatgutted or severely cut the president's big-ticket weapons systems.   The Senate bill endorses the president's two mobile-missileplan, including the request of $1.1 billion for the MXrail-garrison and $100 million for the Midgetman.   The legislation also makes a modest cut of $400 million in the$4.9 billion request for Star Wars and trims $300 million from the$4.7 billion proposal for the B-2 stealth bomber.   The Senate backed the costly bomber, priced at $530 million acopy, if it meets flight test and radar-evasion standards, andaccepted Bush's decision to cancel the F-14D Tomcat jet fighter.   But the chamber diverged from the president on the Marine Corps'V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor assault transport that takes off like ahelicopter but can fly like a plane. The Senate approved $255million in research and development for the Bell-Boeing aircraft.   The House and Senate meet in conference in early September tocomplete a final version of the two defense blueprints the chambershave crafted. The final product will include $295 billion for theDefense Department, plus $10 billion for the Department of Energy.   ``We have more profound differences this year than we've had ina long, long time,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of theSenate Armed Services Committee. ``We face a difficult conferencewith the House on this bill.''   The money still has to be dispersed through appropriations bills.   Last week, the House slashed $1.8 billion from the Star Warsrequest, limited production of the B-2 bomber to two planes nextyear and two the year after that _ half what the administrationsought, required the Pentagon to come up with a program cheaperthan $70 billion for the planned 132 planes and cut $502 millionfrom the MX missile.   The House also eliminated all $100 million for the Midgetman andrestored the V-22 Osprey and the F-14D jet fighter, the two planesBush proposed canceling.   Overwhelming Senate approval of the bill was not without somedissent.   ``Our motto ought to be: In Bombs We Trust. That's our nationalethic _ that is the example we are setting _ here on this floor,''said Sen. Mark Hatfield, the Oregon Republican who entered Congressduring the Vietnam War and was one of the first serviceman on thescene after the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.   Voting against were Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Tom Harkin,D-Iowa; Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Hatfield. Sen. DonaldRiegle, D-Mich., did not vote.   In other developments on the bill, which kept lawmakers willpast midnight on Wednesday and then throughout the day, senators:   _Approved by voice vote a non-binding resolution urging Bush tocontinue development of the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, thetilt-rotor aircraft the administration sought to cancel. Thedefense bill includes $255 million for research and development ofthe Bell-Boeing V-22, which takes off like a helicopter but can flylike a plane.   _By voice vote, the Senate approved an amendment by Sen. TrentLott, R-Miss., requiring graduates of the nation's militaryacademies to serve six years of service after graduation ratherthan the eight years the bill would have required. The currentrequirement is five years. Lott argued that the eight-yearrequirement would drive applicants away from the academies.   The effort to table the amendment failed 55-45 prior to thevoice vote. There is no comparable provision in the House versionof the bill.   _Accepted by voice vote a non-binding resolution instructing theCIA and Defense Department to report by Sept. 1 on how best tolocate and rescue American hostages in Lebanon. The report mustdetail how additional money and agents can be used to find thehostages and win their release.   _Voted 53-44 against a plan to spend $100 million for theeffective deployment of 100 ground-based interceptor missiles inGrand Forks, N.D., by 1995. The interceptors, part of theAccidental Launch Protection System, would have been used againstsudden terrorist missile attacks.   _Approved a series of ``burden-sharing'' amendments aimed atincreasing the contributions to defense by U.S. allies in Europeand Asia.   _Declined to vote on a proposal to restore former Marine Lt.Col. Oliver L. North's $23,000 pension. North has been convicted onthree felony counts in the Iran-Contra affair, and the Senateordered its Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on the subject ofhis pension.   The defense bill legislation contains $200 million foranti-satellite weapons in addition to unspecified amounts in theStar Wars budget.   Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and James Jeffords, R-Vt., hadproposed restrictions to bar such tests unless the administrationcould certify that the Soviets had engaged in tests of their own,had refused to bargain in good faith in limitations and had blockedinternational verification efforts.   The efforts to block attempts to chip away at Bush's defensepackage were evident earlier this morning when the Senate avoided avote on an amendment transferring $450 million from theadministration's $4.9 billion request for the Star Warsanti-missile shield to the war on drugs.   Instead, the Senate approved a compromise drafted by Sen. SamNunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that wouldshift unspent balances in federal programs left over at the end ofthe fiscal year ending Sept. 30 to the anti-drug effort.   The measure exempts entitlement programs, including SocialSecurity, Medicare, and subsidized housing. But all othergovernment programs and agencies, including the Defense Department,would be compelled to contribute.   The Senate has sought to avoid following the House lead ingutting or severely cutting back Bush's strategic programs. Lastweek the House voted to cut $1.8 billion from Star Wars, imposestrict limitations on the B-2 stealth bomber, slash $502 millionfrom the $1.1 billion request for the MX nuclear missile andeliminate all $100 million for the Midgetman missile.   The House and Senate meet in conference in early September tocomplete a final version of the two defense blueprints the chambershave crafted.</TEXT></DOC>
