Dorfman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN BNK </IN><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   Congress is about to make credit-card issuers reveal more about their plastic before it goes into consumers' wallets.    In most parts of the country, the proposed law -- which is expected to be adopted this spring -- will greatly increase the amount of information credit-card applicants will get about fees, rates and other terms. But it is also likely to protect card issuers from some tougher state requirements. House and Senate versions of the bill, which will be reconciled in conference committee, would prevent states from passing their own disclosure rules and could pre-empt state laws already on the books.    The congressional proposals require &quot;just the basic minimum disclosures,&quot; says Leslie Gainer, a lobbyist for U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer organization. &quot;To prevent the states from requiring additional disclosures undercuts consumer protection.&quot;    The legislation's supporters in Congress, however, say it is tough enough. And they say the disclosure requirements may prompt card issuers to lower their interest rates as consumers use the information to shop around for the best deal.    &quot;My goal is to make the marketplace work -- sort of break the oligopoly that the big credit-card issuers have,&quot; says Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who introduced the House-passed bill. He says disclosure &quot;will put pressure on banks to come down&quot; on their rates.    The House and the Senate versions of the legislation have mostly minor differences, and there is no strong opposition to the proposals, even from the banking industry. The House bill, which passed 408-1 in October, would require card issuers to disclose the annual percentage rate, the annual fee, and the grace period a cardholder has before interest charges start to accrue. These three items would have to be shown in a standardized table in solicitation materials.    The Senate's version, introduced by Connecticut Democrat Christopher Dodd and passed by voice vote in December, covers the same three items, but also would require disclosure of the method used to calculate a customer's balance and the amount of any transaction fees.    The requirements, for the most part, would apply to all solicitations -- including telephone pitches as well as ads with forms customers can return to apply for a card. Currently, in most states, a card's interest rate and fees needn't be disclosed until the card is delivered.    About 54% of banks don't reveal the interest rate in their credit-card application forms and other solicitation materials, according to a survey of 175 major card-issuing banks by RAM Research Bankcard Update, a Frederick, Md., newsletter. The survey, conducted in December and January, found that 47% don't disclose the annual fee and that 69% don't reveal the grace period.    Many card issuers have started providing such information in the past couple of years, however, under pressure from consumer groups and state legislatures. The percentage of banks that disclose credit-card interest rates in solicitation materials, for instance, climbed to 46% last year, from 34% in 1986, according to Bankcard Update's tally. In the past month or two, as new state laws have taken effect, some banks that already disclosed the interest rate have started providing additional information, such as details of the grace period and finance charges.    Some consumer advocates say the proposed federal legislation doesn't help consumers as much as certain state disclosure laws, though. For instance, neither the House bill nor the Senate version requires disclosure of miscellaneous fees such as cash-advance fees, fees for exceeding the credit limit and fees for late payment. By contrast, says Michelle Meyer, counsel for government affairs for Consumers Union, at least four states -- Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin -- already require that such information be provided.    Under both versions of the bill sent to the conference committee, states would be prohibited from adopting their own disclosure rules that might give consumers additional protection. Moreover, the House bill would pre-empt the 10 existing state laws on credit-card disclosure, meaning that consumers in some states could actually end up getting less information than now mandated. The Senate version would preserve the existing state laws if legislatures re-enacted them within two years.    For their part, card issuers say they prefer the federal legislation because of the cost of complying with a patchwork of state disclosure rules. Shelly Porges, senior vice president of retail marketing for San Francisco-based Bank of America, says a nationwide rule &quot;simplifies our ability to maintain the same standard for all our customers.&quot; It also avoids the cost of training people to deal with a welter of varying state laws, she says.    But Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a consumers group, says that card issuers &quot;are asking for special privileges here.&quot; He points out that insurance companies, securities firms, and other financial services are all subject to state and federal jurisdiction, and he sees no reason why credit-card issuers shouldn't be as well.    Rep. Schumer says that without the preemption provision, card issuers would have opposed the disclosure bill, delaying and possibly defeating it. &quot;I'll take that three-quarters of a loaf any time,&quot; he says. &quot;To have a dispute over pre-emption kill the bill would be a disservice to consumers.&quot; Besides, he adds, &quot;It is a national market. It makes sense to have a national rule.&quot;    Whether more information will lead to lower rates remains to be seen. Darrell Dreher, a partner in the Columbus, Ohio, office of the national law firm Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue, which often represents banks on credit-card matters, has his doubts. &quot;I don't think it's a whole lot different from shopping for a hamburger,&quot; Mr. Dreher says. &quot;Some people will shop for the cheapest. But many people will stop at a convenient place on the way home.&quot;    ---                     What a Credit Card Costs   Rates and terms are for standard MasterCard and Visa cards issued by the five banks with the largest U.S. market shares                         MARKET  INTEREST ANNUAL    GRACE      BANK               SHARE   RATE     FEE       PERIOD Citibank                8.4%    19.8%*   $20.00    30 days Bank of America         4.8     19.8      18       25 days Chase Manhattan         4.1     17.5      20.00**  25 days First Chicago           3.6     19.8***   20.00**  25 days Manufacturers Hanover   Trust                 2.9     17.8      15.00    25 days AVERAGE (25 banks with   Low interest rates)****       14.8%    $17.76    22 days   *Lower rate (16.8%) available on some cards   **Waived if purchase volume exceeds $2,400 annually   ***Variable rate (prime plus 9.4%) also available, currently 17.9%   ****Includes savings institutions   Source: RAM Research, Bank Credit Card Observer</TEXT></DOC>
