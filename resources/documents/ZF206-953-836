(IEI).andM;The proposed revisions would be similar to royalty schedules used byIntelligent Electronic's retailing subsidiary, Todays Computer BusinessCenters (TCBC).andP;  The revisions were widely supported by Entre franchiseesattending the chain's annual networking meeting here last week.andM;''We're looking at ways to reduce corporate overhead and lower royalties,''said Bert Helfinstein, president and CEO of the McLean, Va., chain, whoseNovember purchase by Intelligent Electronics in a $58 million deal wasfinalized Jan.andP;  4.andP;  Together, the two companies form the industry'ssecond-largest chain, with close to 400 stores.andM;At issue is the development of a new royalty structure that would reducecosts for dealers but would not sacrifice services to corporate clients.andM;''There are only so many dollars available.andP;  .  .  .  Dealers are telling us'I don't need those services,' and we're here to listen to them,'' saidHelfinstein..andM;Although both TCBC and Entre are franchised operations, they offer theirdealers different royalty structures: TCBC requires that its 205 franchiseespay the cost of products sold plus a royalty, while Entre stipulates that its183 dealers pay a royalty on the total value of products sold.andM;Since Entre dealers purchase 90 percent of their products from the corporatedistribution facility, under the current structure they are paying fees onthe remaining 10 percent of the products they purchase elsewhere.andM;A reduction in royalties would enable Entre dealerships to become moreprofitable, said Helfinstein, who was also named vice chairman of IEI.andP;  Hewill report directly to Chairman Richard Sanford.andM;Reduced fees, however, would result in fewer of the services that Entrecurrently offers its dealers, but that TCBC does not.andP;  While TCBC caters tothe small and medium-sized business markets, Entre focuses on sales toFortune 1000 companies, which require more extensive support.andM;Greater profits, however, require that vendors help to stabilize streetprices and control eroding margins.andP;  Already, ''margins are beginning tostabilize,'' said Helfinstein.andM;The merged companies have begun to consolidate resources to reduce operatingcosts.andP;  Two weeks ago, IEI merged its distribution operations into Entre'swarehouse and distribution center in Chantilly, Va.andP;  Total consolidation isexpected to take 18 months.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
