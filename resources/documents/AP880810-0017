The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved the measure ona voice vote Tuesday. The House is expected to vote on the proposalshortly after lawmakers return in September from their next recess.   Similar legislation has yet to progress very far in the Senate.With congressional leaders hoping for adjournment in early October,dramatic movement would have to occur for the measure to have anychance of becoming law this year.   Sponsor Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., called the legislation a``tough, common sense bill,'' and said it was justified because ofthe ``stunning stories of greed'' that continue to emanate fromWall Street in the form of insider trading cases.   Under the legislation, securities firms would be required toconstruct mechanisms for detecting insider trading by theiremployees. Companies could face fines if they do inadequate jobs ofpreventing the release of confidential financial information bytheir workers.   The bill would boost the maximum penalty for criminal insidertrading from $500,000 to $2.5 million per violation for companies,and from $100,000 to $1 million for individuals.   People who provide the government with information about illegalinsider trading could receive bounties which would be a portion ofthe profits that were earned illicitly.   The maximum jail term for insider trading convictions would belengthened from five years to 10 years.   Another section would authorize the Securities and ExchangeCommission to cooperate with foreign countries that areinvestigating insider trading cases, in hopes that this wouldencourage the other nations to help U.S. authorities pursuingsimilar cases abroad.   Securities companies have unsuccessfully sought inclusion in thebill of a definition of insider trading so firms would know whenthe law was being broken. Currently, the courts and governmentagencies make their own interpretations of when insider tradingoccurs.   Opponents of putting such a definition in the law have arguedthat including that language would enable violators to skirt theprohibition.   The measure has drawn support from Republicans as well asDemocrats. Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., said the bill shows that``insider trading will not be tolerated in our securities markets.''</TEXT></DOC>
