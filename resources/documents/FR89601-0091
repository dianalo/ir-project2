Sources_Operating.'' The surveillance requirementincludes a table showing the minimum amperage which each battery must becapable of delivering as a function of time when called upon to deliveremergency loads. The licensee has recalculated these emergency loads andthe resulting battery profiles to account for current safety equipmentconfigurations. The amendment inserts currently applicable values intothe table. In making the calculation, the licensee used a different aging factor forthe 250 volt batteries than for the 24 volt and 125 volt batteries. Thesurveillance requirement is revised to include separate criteria applicableto the 250 volt batteries for the periodic performance discharge tests.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated March 18, 1988, as supplemented by letter dated April 12,1989. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed amendment is required to ensure that the batteries are capableof providing emergency loads. The periodic surveillance required by thetechnical specifications is intended to show that the batteries are capableof meeting the actual expected loads. The licensee has recently reevaluatedemergency loads and has recomputed the battery requirements for these loads.The amendment will place these up-to-date values into the technical specifications.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action This action does not involve a change to equipment or to operating procedures.It is limited to a revision to the calculated emergency battery loads.An existing license requirement would be amended to reflect the new calculations.The staff has completed its safety evaluation of the proposed amendmentand finds the change acceptable. The proposed action does not involve a significant change in the probabilityor consequences of any accident previously evaluated, nor does it involvea new or different kind of accident. Consequently, any radiological releasesresulting from an accident would not be significantly greater than previouslydetermined. The proposed amendment does not otherwise affect routine radiologicalplant effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are nosignificant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposedamendment. The Commission also concludes that the proposed action willnot result in a significant increase in individual or cumulative occupationalradiation exposure. With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment does notaffect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiologicalenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Because the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmentalimpacts associated with the proposed action, there is no need to examinealternatives to the proposed action. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the Final Environmenal Statement related to operationof Nuclear Project No. 2, dated December 1981. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request that supports the proposedamendment. The NRC staff did not consult other agencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludesthat the proposed action will have not significant adverse effect on thequality of the human environment. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 18, 1988 (53 FR 17810). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated March 18, 1988 and supplement dated April 12, 1989, whichare available for public inspection at the Commission's Public DocumentRoom, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Richland CityLibrary, Swift and Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 25th day of May 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George W.
