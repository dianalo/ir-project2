Haan, the principalshareholders of Telesphere Communications.andM;It's a stock deal, with each ITI shareholder getting a fraction of a share ofTelesphere common currently held by GH worth 80 cents, based on the averageclosing price of Telesphere common for the 2 weeks prior to closing.andO;Estimates are the deal will be worth between .33 and .44 of a Telesphereshare for each ITI share.andM;As part of the transaction, GH Ventures will use its best efforts to transferITI's network contracts from MCI to Telesphere, and ITI will ultimatelybecome a part of Telesphere.andP;  Like many companies in the old alternativeoperator business, ITI and Telesphere have hit hard financial times as majorfirms like ATandamp;T exploit their higher prices and run ads telling people how toget around them.andP;  Telesphere, in fact, recently got out of the 1+ longdistance business, concentrating all its energies on alternative operatoroperations and its 800 and 900 lines.andM;(Dana Blankenhorn/19910405/Press Contact: Phil Sawyer, InternationalTelecharge, 214-653-1265)</TEXT></DOC>
