At a time some competitors are racked by financial losses andlabor tensions, American plans to spend up to $14 billion through1994 to modernize its fleet. Over the last two months American, thenation's second-largest carrier, has gone on an aircraft shoppingspree exceeding $10 billion.   Executives of the Ft. Worth, Tex.-based carrier held a newsconference to announce orders for up to 150 Fokker-100 short-haulplanes and 35 Boeing jetliners.   Fokker, the Amsterdam, Netherlands-based aerospace group,disclosed March 16 that it was negotiating the order.   American has a fleet of 478 planes that already is one of theyoungest in the industry at an average of about 9.4 years. Thecarrier plans to reduce the average to around 8.4 years by 1992,with a fleet of more than 600 planes by 1991.   The industry average age was about 12.67 years as of July 1,1988, the last date reliable statistics were available, according toAvmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm in Arlington, Va.   ``The public wants to fly on airlines that have younger, quieteraircraft,'' Robert Crandall, American's chairman and president, toldthe news conference.   Last week, American announced a $95 million expansion of itscorporate headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, and began distributing$121 million in profit sharing to employees. The carrier also planswithin the next several weeks to announce the location for a new$200 million maintenance facility.   Industry analysts say the expenditures indicate American'sfinancial strength and reflect its strategy for fleet upgrading androute expansion.   AMR Corp., American's parent, earned a company-record $476million last year on $8.8 billion in revenue, making the airline thenation's most profitable.   Crandall said the twin-engine Fokkers, which seat about 100people each, would enable the company to retire older Boeing 727sand replace aging British Aerospace planes used primarily forflights of less than 1,000 miles.   American made firm orders for 75 Fokkers and options for another75 in a deal potentially worth $3.09 billion. The Dutch aircraftmaker indicated last week that the order was being negotiated.   The Boeing order is for 25 757-200s and 10 767-300ER aircraft,with an estimated value of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. The latestBoeing acquisition will bring American's total orders of theseaircraft to 85 firm and 85 options.   American also said it had placed an order with Rolls-Royce Inc.for 238 engines valued at up to $1.7 billion to power the Fokkersand 757s. The 767s will be powered by General Electric engines, theairline said.   The new orders came on the heels of American's giant deal lastmonth with McDonnell Douglas Corp. to buy eight long-range MD-11widebody jetliners with options for another 42. In that accord,American also took options on 100 MD-80s, a smaller plane designedto replace the Boeing 727.   Analysts placed the value of the McDonnell Douglas deal at about$7 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
