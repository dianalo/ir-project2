At press conference  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  LOUISIANA; GOVERNOR; ELECTION; CANDIDATE; RACIAL; CRIME  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  Your articles concerning David Duke bring back many memories of my life inLouisiana. During the '60s and early '70s the state was the target of nationalattention concerning bigotry and racist treatment of blacks.;   Theestablished business environment was one where blacks were still servants andwhites were the bosses. Through the efforts of many conscientious white andblack citizens, Louisiana brought about a social harmony that was often enviedin areas outside the South. Then commenced the current decline in the state'sfinancial fortunes. The tension between white and black, poor and rich beganto emerge.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DEMAGOGUES LIKE DUKE EMERGE IN HARD TIMES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     Who is to blame for these financial problems? The increase in welfareexpenditures that concerns Duke is a symptom of the underlying problem, not acause. The source is insufficient jobs, growth, opportunity and capitalformation. This is a problem for all of the state's citizens, not merely thewhite Christians.;   The voters' interest in a better Louisiana and a bettercommercial environment can be brought about by insisting the federalgovernment adopt measures to ensure and promote capital formation, economicgrowth and reform in education while simultaneously affirming the civil rightsof all Americans.;   The growing gap between the U.S. economy and its fullpotential is, of course, the responsibility of Washington, not Baton Rouge.Since 1988, the economy has grown at 1.3 percent per year in real terms. Thisis far below its 4 percent per year norm. This deficit explains the growingdisillusionment and frustration of the middle class.;   It is easy tounderstand, then, the appeal that Duke has in his campaign for lessgovernment, reduction of certain types of social programs and the proposedreduction of tax rates. His argument that the former governor is ill-suited tothis task is also very persuasive.;   Troubling, however, is the price thatthe citizens of the state will pay for this &quot;reform.&quot; Their concern over theircheckbooks seems to overrule other important issues. When other societies havebeen faced with similar, apparently unrecoverable economic turmoil, thendemagogues such as Duke appear. Their message is parallel. &quot;We will fix thisproblem and improve your situation, voter, but of course, we need to diminishthe lot of others. After all, they are getting more than their share.&quot;;  Whether it is the poor or the blacks of Louisiana (or even the Jews inGermany), the end result is the same. The informed voters must look beyond thetemporary economic gain they believe will be secured with Duke's direction.The loss of dignity and violation of their own ethical standards will hauntthem long into the next generation.;   -- Thomas E.
