But this time, some non-bugs have joined the choir. Theseinvestors, with no known penchant for gold, say they alsothink the metal is about to have another fling in the sun.</LP><TEXT>   One of those investors is Paul Tudor Jones, who is amongthe biggest commodity traders on Wall Street. &quot;I think gold,from a supply-demand standpoint, can stand on its own twolegs right now,&quot; says Mr. Jones, whose Tudor Investment Corp.has more than $500 million under management.   Gold fever has also bitten Comstock Partners, whichmanages Dreyfus Capital Value Fund and Comstock PartnersStrategy Fund. Comstock is telling aggressive clients toinvest 15% of their assets in gold stocks. Michael Aronstein,president of the company, says the metal could climb morethan 15% to 20% -- the minimum for any investment to enticethe partners -- as more investors abandon &quot;paper assets&quot; forthe security of gold.   The gold recommendations come as James Dines -- one of theoriginal gold bugs who endorsed it in 1960 at $35 an ounce --has once again turned bullish. In fact, he predicts gold'sprice, which hasn't been higher than the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage since 1980, will almost certainly rise above theaverage this decade, &quot;depending upon how stupid Congress is&quot;with respect to government spending.   Investors have good reason to be skeptical about all thebullishness. Gold has been dullsville since brieflyrollicking above $500 an ounce after the 1987 stock-marketcrash. At the London afternoon fix Friday, gold was $370.25,up $1. In New York, gold for August delivery closed Wednesdayat $370.20; the Commodity Exchange was closed Thursday andFriday.   Except for two years in the late 1970s and early 1980s,investors who bought gold usually haven't fared well.   As the chart accompanying this article shows, anyone whobought gold in June 1978 and held on until June 1991 earned acompound 5.4% a year (see accompanying chart -- WSJ July 8,1991). In contrast, the stocks in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500index earned 15.9% a year with dividends reinvested. Golddoesn't pay dividends like stocks or interest like bonds.   Investors who bought gold in any subsequent June since1978 did even worse. A June 1987 purchaser suffered a 5%average annual decline through June 1991. Even investors whohad the prescience to buy gold in 1960 at $35 an ounce, asMr. Dines suggested, would have earned an annual compoundreturn of only 7.8%.   Gold's proponents can't dispute this sorry track history,but they remain adamant. Mr. Jones's director of research,Peter Borish, says gold is an &quot;underowned asset&quot; comparedwith stocks, which he considers overvalued. He says the sameforces that might hurt stocks -- the big public and privatedebt in the U.S. and fear that the Federal Reserve and otherbig nations' central banks will try to lighten that debtburden through inflation -- could boost gold prices. Unliketrue gold bugs, who can be spotted by their stratosphericpredictions -- such as more than $3,000 from Mr. Dines -- Mr.Borish says a &quot;significant move&quot; for gold would be to $550 anounce.   Comstock's Mr. Aronstein says the shakeout that began withthe weakest credits -- junk-bond issuers, Latin Americadebtor countries and marginal property developers funded bysavings and loans -- is spreading to more solid credits suchas big banks, state municipal governments and the Japanesefinancial system. Investors will turn to gold, he says, &quot;forthe same reason people get out of the water when they see afin&quot; -- because they are scared to death.   On the other hand, some economists believe that if therecovery from the recession lasts the length of an averageexpansion, the economy will grow enough to cover the baddebts of the savings and loan associations and banks.   James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observernewsletter, agrees that investors want the perceived safetyof gold. He predicts the &quot;ultimate outcome of the financialexcesses of the last decade&quot; will be higher gold prices.While investors were searching for yield with little regardfor risk in the 1980s, they will be driven in the 1990s by anunreasonable demand for safety, Mr. Grant says.   The great hope of gold fans is runaway inflation, whichdevalues the dollar and other investments that compete withgold.   For example, Dave Davis, editor of the Switch Fund Timingletter in Rochester, N.Y., in late May made his first goldrecommendation in 1 1/2 years. His reasoning: The federalgovernment's deficit problems will spark a rise in inflationthat could send gold up to about $500. He told hissubscribers to put 15% of their investable funds in gold orgold stocks.   Of course, gold bugs have predicted inflation before.Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie-MellonUniversity and a visiting scholar at the American EnterpriseInstitute, says anyone who predicts higher precious-metalsprices based on increasing inflation is on shaky ground.&quot;Commodity prices and wages indicate to me a fall in the rateof inflation, not an increase,&quot; the professor says.   Despite Comstock's bullish argument, a debt collapse wouldbe deflationary for gold, claims Robert Brinker, editor ofthe Marketimer letter in Princeton, N.J. In such a collapse,&quot;the most valuable asset would be a 30-year Treasury bond,&quot;he asserts.   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Activity in the oil markets is expected to pick up thisweek as traders return from the extended July Fourth holiday.Market participants will continue to focus on crude oil andpetroleum product inventories.   Last week both the American Petroleum Institute and theEnergy Department reported that crude oil stocks decreased.However, the American Petroleum Institute said gasolineinventories increased while the government said theydeclined. The disparity has created some uncertainty in thegasoline outlook, which was looking bearish.   At the same time, traders said they will also examinedemand figures for any signs of a pickup in the sluggishthird quarter related to a recovery in the U.S. economy. Ifthe U.S. shows further signs of coming out of the recession,energy demand should increase. However, no one expectssurging demand this time of year, which historically is oneof slack energy demand. By the winter months demand normallypicks up again. Friday's activity was very light on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange as many market participants took theday off. Crude oil and gasoline contracts advanced.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          After the close of trading Thursday, the AgricultureDepartment is expected to forecast larger corn and soybeanharvests than last year.   Estimates of the potential crops vary. Some traders arespeculating that the nation's average corn yield could reacha record of more than 122 bushels an acre. Generally, growingconditions were ideal throughout much of the Midwest earlierthis year.   Other traders, however, think the corn yield could averagebetween 117 bushels an acre and 119 bushels an acre. Much ofthe corn crop in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota got alate start because of an unusually wet spring. A dry June inmuch of Illinois might have also trimmed potential productionthere, analysts said.   Weather conditions in July and August will also have alarge bearing on the size of the harvests.   Don Roose, a grain analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc., DesMoines, Iowa, said he is expecting a 1991 corn harvest of8.05 billion bushels, compared with the 1990 crop of 7.93billion bushels. He is basing his forecast on an average U.S.corn yield of 117 bushels an acre.   Mr. Roose also said he expects a soybean harvest of 1.96billion bushels, compared with the 1990 crop of 1.92 billionbushels.</TEXT></DOC>
