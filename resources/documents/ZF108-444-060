AUTOMATOR 2.3BandM;Automator is an extremely powerful package with a myriad of uses.andP;  DirectTechnology refers to it as a &quot;software robot,&quot; and although it was originallydesigned for automating micro-to-mainframe communications, Automator can beused to automate and simplify any complex process.andM;LEarn, the development environment, requires 160K bytes of memory andcomprises a program generator with a built-in editor.andP;  LEarn allows skeletonAutomator Control Language (ACL) programs to be built, by monitoring anoperator's keystrokes and by defining windows on the screen to query forspecific content.andM;ACL is a high-level structured language, complete with arrays, string andnumeric variables and complex screen control.andP;  ACL provides access to memorythrough PEEK and POKE, and to machine ports.andP;  It also has full DOS file I/O,including indexed files.andM;Automator's compiler is used to compile ACL programs, which are executed byits 70K-byte run-time interpreter.andM;Because Automator controls the operation of the PC, it can make use of anysystem resources.andP;  This capability enabled the test application, with somemodification, to work as well asynchronously as it did with DCA's IRMA boardand software.andM;Automator allows users to easily design custom menu-driven user interfaceswith pop-up menus and help screens.andM;The documentation is well-written and thorough, but is somewhat difficult touse because of its small print and lack of graphics.andP;  Prior programmingexperience is highly recommended to take full advantage of Automator.andM;Direct Technology Ltd., based in England, has U.S.andP;  headquarters in New Yorkand can be reached at (212) 475-2747.andM;Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;Before deciding on Automator, Dennis Hunter, systems engineer for EastmanKodak Co., an imaging and chemical products manufacturer in Rochester, N.Y.,andO;evaluated Attachmate's Now!.andP;  &quot;Personally, I didn't like [Now!] at all --Automator's features are far superior,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;With Automator, you havean editor, and because everything is memory-resident, you can run [Automator]from the same environment without going through separate editing, compilingand debugging functions.andM;&quot;You do not have all of these features in [Now!],&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Some of the applications I've written [with Automator] have saved $40,000 to$50,000 a year on routine data-entry jobs that can be automated,&quot; he said.andM;However, Hunter would like to see some improvements in Automator.andP;  &quot;I wouldlike to see the ability to pass parameters and procedures,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;Another omission is that [Automator] does not deal with floating-pointarithmetic, and the manual is not well indexed.&quot;andM;Another buyer, Kent Cole, communications analyst for Rush-Presbyterian-St.andO;Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, also praised the product.andM;&quot;Automator has advanced scripting capabilities,&quot; said Cole.andP;  &quot;You can entercommands, look at responses, and base the next commands on the results.andM;&quot;A lot of times, we use Automator to detect errors in the connection sequenceand recover from them,&quot; he added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
