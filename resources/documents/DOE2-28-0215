These experiments were coducted in the Bureau'sintermediate-scale fire tunnel, which simulates environmental conditionsin underground mines. Smoke characteristics, gas concentrations, massloss, and ventilation were measured. From these values, heat-releaserates, particle sizes, obscuration rates, combustion yields, and productionconstants were calculated. The information was sought as part of a comprehensivestudy of combustible materials that will ultimately advance the designof more efficient fire detection and suppression systems. The coal combustionmeasurements presented in the report, together with previous analysesof wood and transformer fluid fires, form a data base by which futurestudies of other mine combustibles can be compared.</TEXT></DOC>
