Background on the Pennsylvania Program </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">II. Submission of Amendment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">III. Public Comment Procedures </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background on the Pennsylvania Program</ITAG>The Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Pennsylvania programon July 31, 1982.

Submission of Amendment </ITAG>By letter dated May 7, 1985, (Administrative Record No. PA 552), the PennsylvaniaDER submitted an amendment to revise the Pennsylvania program. The proposalwill reduce DER's approved staffing level from 405 positions to 388 positions.OSMRE published a notice announcing receipt of this amendment and the openingof the public comment period in the June 18, 1985, <T4>Federal Register </T4> (50 FR 25265-25266). The public comment periodended July 18, 1985. In November 1984, Pennsylvania combined the coal mining program which waspreviously housed in two bureaus (Bureau of Mining and Reclamation andBureau of Water Quality Management) into one bureau. Pennsylvania indicatedthat as a result of this reorganization and other changes to improve efficiency,the State requires fewer people to administer the program. OSMRE reviewed the proposed amendment and determined that additional informationand clarification was necessary before deciding on whether to approve ordisapprove the submission. In response to OSMRE's request, Pennsylvaniasubmitted on February 20, 1986, May 1, 1986, and August 3, 1987, workloadanalyses, staffing charts, and detailed narratives describing functionsand responsibilities under the new DER organizational structure (AdministrativeRecord No's. PA 596, PA 604, and PA 670). OSMRE analyzed this informationand held discussions with DER on significant concerns which included staffingnecessary to meet the required inspection frequencies and to handle a backlogof civil penalty cases.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comment Procedures </ITAG>OSMRE is reopening and extending the public comment period for Pennsylvania'sproposed amendment in order to provide the public an opportunity to reconsiderthe amendment's adequacy in light of the additional information submittedby DER and changes in the scope of the State's regulatory program whichhave occurred since the amendment was submitted. Specifically, OSMRE isseeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicableprogram approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15(d). If the amendment is deemedadequate, it will become part of the Pennsylvania program. <ITAG tagnum="84">Written Comments </ITAG>Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposedin this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter'srecommendations.
