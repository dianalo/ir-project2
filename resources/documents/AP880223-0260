In a statement, Balladur said the 886 million franc, or $158million, deal that was signed Jan. 11 between Pearson and Les Echoowner Jacqueline Beytout ``is subject to the explicit authorizationof the French authorities.''   Mrs. Beytout called the government's position ``exclusivelypolitical,'' and the management of Les Echos said the newspaperwouldn't publish on Tuesday in protest.   Under regulations, takeovers involving French companies andother European entities must be submitted for approval by theFrench treasury. If no objection is raised after a two-monthperiod, the transaction goes ahead automatically.   The ministry noted, however, that a 1986 press law stipulatesthat individuals or corporate entities that don't reside in theEuropean Community can't acquire a stake of more than 20 percent inthe capital of a French publishing company without prior governmentapproval.   The ministry said ``the European character of the Pearson groupdoesn't appear to be durably established at this time.''   Ministry officials said the main stumbling block to the sale isthe 20.5 percent stake in Pearson held by media magnate RupertMurdoch.   News Corp, Murdoch's Australian press group, disclosed Jan. 13that it had increased its stake in Pearson by purchasing a 4.9percent block of shares from Cerus SA, the French investment arm ofItalian financier Carlo de Benedetti.   Aides to Balladur said the government is concerned that Murdochmight be tempted to seek a controlling interest in Pearson,although Murdoch has denied any such plans.  </TEXT></DOC>
