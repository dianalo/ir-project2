The International Fund for Ireland, an outgrowth of the 1985Anglo-Irish pact, sought to ease the two decades of violence betweenCatholics and Protestants in British-ruled Northern Ireland byimproving economic conditions, thereby reducing deep-seededresentments.   The fund, run by an independent commission appointed jointly byBritain and the republic of Ireland, fuels economic projects acrossNorthern Ireland and in border counties in the republic, areas whereboth tensions and unemployment run rampant.   The program got off the ground in 1986 largely due to athree-year, $120 million U.S. aid package pushed personally by twoof America's most famous Irishmen, Ronald Reagan and then-HouseSpeaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass.   But concern has grown over how the agency is doling out the money.   ``Up until this point, the policy of the fund has been to spreadthe money around, take what I call a scatter-gun approach to it,under the theory that all areas in Northern Ireland and the bordercounties have been affected by the troubles. And that's true,'' saidRep. Brian J. Donnelly, D-Mass. ``But the reality is some areas havebeen affected more than others.''   Some of the projects backed by International Fund grants havebeen praised, such as the creation of an industrial park forfledgling businessmen near the Protestant-Catholic divide in Belfast.   But others have come under sharp criticism, including therefurbishing of a bank, which later returned the grant, and aid fora parachute school, which fund officials said was given to helppromote tourism and lift the local economy.   More importantly, according to Donnelly, some Catholicnationalists who oppose British rule of Northern Ireland felt theywere being excluded from the program. The money, he said, was notalways going to the neediest areas.   Donnelly, an O'Neill protege who has led the fight in Congressfor Irish aid since the House speaker retired two years ago, metwith fund officials in Ireland last month and was told the systemrecently has been revamped.   The fund now will target grants to areas most adversely affectedby the violence and economic depression, such as West Belfast, hesaid.   Fund managers also have hired their own staff to help nationalistcommunities apply for grants.   ``My position has been that if mistakes have been made, and Ithink some have, I think the fund managers have learned from themand let's wait and see what the next go-round of grants bring,''Donnelly said in an interview last week.   Donnelly, chairman of the Friends of Ireland caucus in Congress,and other leading proponents of Irish aid, including Sen. Edward M.Kennedy, D-Mass., and his nephew, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,D-Mass., are prepared to push for more money for the fund this year.   Sen. Kennedy said he was optimistic Congress would continue tosupport the fund despite the criticism.   ``Encouraging economic development is one of the most effectiveroles that the United States can play in ending the conflict,'' thesenator said.   But U.S. financing for the program has remained a tenuousproposition since the three-year package ran its course last year.Levels that had averaged $40 million a year for the first threeyears were reduced to about $10 million last year. Donnelly andIrish officials attribute the decrease to budget constraints withinCongress rather than a dissatisfaction with the program, but otherssay criticisms of the program are expected to result in it beingcarefully scrutinized on Capitol Hill this year.   Donnelly predicts Congress will continue to fund the program, butconcedes it was never a State Department favorite.   ``Ronald Reagan personally supported it, but I think within thebureaucracy (at State) there has been less than enthusiasm,'' hesaid.   The current Reagan budget, as the previous one, proposed no moneyfor the Irish fund.</TEXT></DOC>
