The static model, which defines application objectswhen the Broker is set up on the network, originates from the jointHewlett-Packard Co-Sun-NCR Corp-Object Design Inc submission.andP;  The RequestBroker gives developers a choice between the two methods - it has aninterface for each - though each of the six firms say they will incorporateboth topologies into their Object Request Broker-compliant products.andP;  Adevelopment language - the Interface Definition Language - merges the twoelements, enabling object-oriented developers to write just one set of code.andO;There are, however, performance differences between the two approaches.andP;  TheBroker specification, which also includes an Object Adaptor and an InterfaceRepository, is out in January of next year, and costs $50.andP;  The RequestBroker will be followed by the Object Model specification, a common languageenabling objects to communicate with each other, in the first quarter of nextyear; specifications of object services will start shipping during the thirdquarter of 1992.andM;DEC, X/Open offer supportandM;One year old Data General Corp spin-out HyperDesk Inc said it would offer itsdistributors an object management system based on the Broker specification inJanuary, including applications development features and services.andP;  SunSoftand Hewlett-Packard promised their joint Distributed Object ApplicationFramework, already a year in development, by the second half of 1992, withsource code available to developers by the second quarter.andP;  DEC, whichsubmitted its NAS Applications Control Architecture Technology as part of theBroker said that ACA Services on VMS and Ultrix was &quot;the first commerciallyavailable distributed object-oriented software to implement the ORB&quot;.andP;  As forconsortia, X/Open, the Open Software Foundation, Unix International Inc andthe Interactive Multi-Media Association all offered support, with X/Opencommitting to publish the specification as a preliminary requirementsdocument.andP;  Notably absent were Microsoft Corp and the new IBM Corp-AppleComputer Inc Taligent venture.andP;  Retro-fitting existing object-orientedtechnology, such as Microsoft Windows or Pink, to the Broker, was describedas &quot;non-trivial but manageable&quot;, and Object Management Group president ChrisStone predicted that IBM-Apple would offer more concrete information in thefuture.andP;  Hewlett-Packard and NCR are among those integrating the ObjectRequest Broker with Windows applications.andM;IBM and Apple plan to keep the best bits ofandM;Taligent Pink to themselvesandM;Apple Computer Inc executives have been revealing to MacWeek magazine alittle more about how the futuristic object-oriented Taligent operatingsystem will co-exist with existing software.andP;  Ed Birss, senior vice-presidentof Apple's object-based systems division, tipped as the future chiefoperating officer of Taligent Inc, told the paper that Apple and IBM Corpwould address the problem through a set of Taligent objects calledPersonalities.andP;  These, running under the Taligent operating system, shouldprovide full emulation of operating systems including MacOS, IBM's AIX andApple's A/UX Unix versions, and even OS/2.andP;  When an application is launched,the Taligent operating system will know which Personality it should run, andwill automatically set up the interface and the application.andP;  But what aboutnew features? Taligent should make it easier to develop and customise genericapplications, said Birss, with a solid set of objects that enable &quot;newapplication categories to be developed that aren't possible now, because theyare economically infeasible to develop and support&quot;.andP;  A three-dimensionalversion of Apple's QuickDraw application could be an example of an objectthat Apple or IBM could take and layer into their current operating systems,providing some of the functionality of the fully object-based system.andP;  Suchobjects will even find their way into IBM mainframes, Birss predicts.andP;  Butthere are plenty of issues still unresolved.andP;  While Taligent's operatingsystem will be available from Apple, IBM, Taligent and authorised third partycompanies, it is not known if the Personalities will be freely available, orsimply bundled in with machines from Apple or IBM.andP;  For instance, will IBMand third parties be able to sell the MacOS Personality on its machines?andO;Birss hints that they won't.andP;  &quot;There are certain advantages that Apple andIBM, as founders of Taligent, would have.andP;  It's not our objective to foster aclone business.&quot; The operating system user interface will take &quot;the best ofwhat's available from both IBM and Apple, so that customers don't have tore-learn how to use a Taligent machine&quot;.andP;  Birss says that Taligent will runon a wide range of machines, including Intel Corp iAPX-86 and Motorola 68000family systems, as well as the IBM PowerPC RISC.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
