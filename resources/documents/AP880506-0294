(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A class action suit was filed Fridayon behalf of Texaco Inc. shareholders who claim takeover strategistCarl Icahn manipulated the price of the oil giant's shares so hecould buy them cheaply.   The suit is a companion to one filed by Texaco earlier this weekalleging massive securities law violations by Icahn, who isTexaco's largest shareholder and chairman of Trans World AirlinesInc.   Stanley Bernstein, an attorney who helped file the shareholdersuit, said he expected the case to be joined with the main Texacoaction at U.S. District Court in White Plains. Texaco isheadquartered in nearby Harrison, N.Y.   The shareholder suit claims that Icahn, along with associatesand companies he controls, deceived, manipulated and harmed otherTexaco shareholders to advance his own interests since buying a bigblock of Texaco stock last fall.   Icahn was out of his office and unavailable for comment on thesuit.   He began buying the stock while Texaco was negotiating asettlement with rival Pennzoil over a $10.3 billion judgmentawarded Pennzoil after a Texas jury found Texaco had illegallyinterfered with Pennzoil's merger with Getty Oil Co.   Texaco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 ofthe bankruptcy code last year and emerged last month under acourt-approved reorganization plan.   The shareholder suit charges Icahn interfered with thereorganization process, traded on inside information, circulatedfalse and misleading information and otherwise engaged in actswhich constituted a ``manipulative or deceptive device'' prohibitedby the federal securities laws.   Such actions allowed Icahn to purchase an estimated 30 millionshares of Texaco between October 1987 and May 1988 below marketvalue, the suit said.   The suit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of all those Texacoshareholders who sold stock during the period Oct. 2, 1987 and May3, 1988.   The suit was filed in Manhattan but was expected to betransfered to White Plains.   Texaco's suit, filed Tuesday, seeks to invalidate Icahn attemptto install himself and some associates on the company's board ofdirectors.</TEXT></DOC>
