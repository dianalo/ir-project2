The male-dominated 90-plus folk-dance troupe allbut raised the rafters and tore apart the wings on the tiny (48-foot-wide)stage in San Francisco's Orpheum Theater on Tuesday night, opening a week'srun.;   Moiseyev presents virtuosic folk dance at its best. Never mind thatthe Orpheum lighting team still needs about 15 rehearsals before they canfollow a dancer on stage with a spot.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE ALL-STARS OF RUSSIAN FOLK DANCE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related article on page 5H of this section. Dance  </MEMO><TEXT>     But, despite all the Soviet crises and government changes, The eye-poppingMoiseyev virtuosos are as strong as ever: Their keenly disciplined formationsare reminiscent of the best ballet corps. They explode into movement, whetherit's the laser-straight line of voluptuous &quot;village women&quot; or the lean,gymnastic males exhibiting their prowess. The last dancer looks as polished asthe first. The precision is immaculate.;   The accomplishments of the troupe,back in the United States for the eighth time since 1958, are a triumph forartistic director/choreographer Igor Moiseyev, a living legend who turns 86 inJanuary. He founded this joyous celebration in 1937 and is still sharp as anicicle. In this era of tired-blood touring companies, Moiseyev shows how anall-star ensemble should look.;   Touches of the theatrical;   His specialsecret is the element of theater. Mixed with the dances are appealing humantouches: the knowing wink, the jovial laugh, the flirtation, the oldstersreliving a courtship, the revelers forging a friendship. Moiseyev's uses hiskeen eye to flesh out the personalities and produce touching, heartwarmingmoments amid the feats of agility. And when the fireworks come, they're donewith such genial ease and modesty that it's ingratiating.;   Moiseyev's &quot;GreekSuite&quot; (1991), receiving its U.S. premiere on this tour, marks a sedate newdirection for the choreographer, sidestepping acrobatics for the graceful linedances inspired by Greek wedding receptions. The new score of bouzouki musicfrom Mikis Teodorakis sounds like a &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; rerun. The suite isexquisitely low-key and maddeningly authentic: Yawn.;   Moiseyev's &quot;Masks,&quot; awork created in 1947, should have had its U.S. premiere then rather than now.It's a dated, garish, eclectic impressionistic piece blending Mongolian legendand Peking opera. But if you've seen the real thing, this doesn't ring true.&quot;Masks&quot; involves giants, demons, a dragon, snakes (produced by sleight ofhand), a beheading, wild histrionics and a startling transformation of asedate chorus line into devils.;   The program's biggest hit remainsMoiseyev's signature piece, &quot;Partisans,&quot; where cloaked figures glide about thestage as if on rollers. This amazing technique of smooth walking/running helpsilluminate a tale of devil-may-care Soviet resistance fighters marshaledagainst invading Nazi troops.;   Conjures up the exotic;   The folk traditionsechoed here extend far beyond the Soviet borders, wherever they may be thisweek. The Moldavian dances of &quot;Zhok,&quot; for instance, recall the hot-bloodedhora and klezmer music heard in Israel. And the nimble boldness and happyabandon showcased in the Crimean &quot;Tartar Dance&quot; (1939) could be at home onseveral continents.;   The male dancers stop the show with their flying splitsand prisadki -- those squat-kicks characteristic of the Russian tradition.There's also an athletic male who dances on his booted toes.;   For an encorethe troupe brought down the house Tuesday with a Virginia reel danced to&quot;Turkey in the Straw.&quot;;   This is a joyous show for the whole family. But gothis week, or forget it. After Sunday's last curtain, the troupe returns toMoscow.; Moiseyev Dance Company; Where: Orpheum Theatre, 1192 Market St. (atEighth Street), San Francisco; Through: Sunday (no performance ThanksgivingDay); Tickets: $25-$45; Call: (408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL HERTELENDY, Mercury News Dance Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5H  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  643  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, November 28, 199100333079,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
