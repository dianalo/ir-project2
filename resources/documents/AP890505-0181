He is very proud of bothappointments and thinks they are outstanding men who should beconfirmed,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.   Gregg, who was Bush's national security adviser when Bush wasvice president, has been nominated as ambassador to South Korea.Negroponte, Honduran ambassador when Bush was vice president, hasbeen tapped as the Bush administration's emissary to Mexico.   Negroponte attended a White House celebration of Cinco de Mayo,a Mexican holiday, and was warmly introduced by the president asthe next ambassador.   Fitzwater also told reporters the president has not discussedthe question of whether to pardon Oliver North after the formerWhite House aide's conviction Thursday on three felony counts inconnection with the Iran-Contra case.   In the past, Bush has called North a hero and said he hoped theformer Marine officer would be acquitted.   Fitzwater refused any further comment on the North verdict ortrial documents that suggested Bush was involved in a Reaganadministration plan to make a quid-pro-quo arrangement withHonduras in return for its assistance to the Contra rebels inNicaragua.   But when asked if trial documents, which have caused somelawmakers to express reservations about Negroponte and Gregg, mightinfluence Bush to back away from the nominations, Fitzwaterindicated that would not be the case.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Asia subcommittee, is said to have asked Secretary ofState James A. Baker III to reconsider Gregg's nomination becausetrial materials raised doubts about Gregg's past assertions that hedid nothing illegal or improper in his contacts with North andother Iran-contra figures.   Gregg's relationship with Felix Rodriguez, a key figure inNorth's private aid network to help the Contras during thecongressional ban on aid, was a controversial topic throughout theIran-Contra investigations. Gregg has repeatedly bolstered Bush'sassertion that as vice president he did not know the extent ofNorth's clandestine efforts.   Gregg's confirmation hearing is scheduled for next week.   The Foreign Relations Committee delayed a vote on Negroponte'snomination last month after some Democratic senators requested moretime to review whether as ambassador to Honduras he was involved ina quid pro quo arrangement to entice Honduras to help the rebels.   John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, has cited a cable fromNegroponte as proof that Bush did not engage in a discussion ofsuch arrangements for the Contras when he met with HonduranPresident Roberto Suazo in early 1985.   Fitzwater said the appropriate congressional committees would bebriefed on confidential cables that described Bush's activities inthat regard.   Bush on Thursday denied being involved in any quid pro quoarrangement nd denied knowing of any such effort by others in theadministration.   Documents from the North trial had Bush and Suazo meeting at atime when internal Reagan administration memos suggested a plan inwhich continuing U.S. aid to Latin American countries would belinked to assistance for the rebels.   The document never asserted that Bush discussed a quid pro quoarrangement with Suazo. But it said he explained to the Honduransthat they were to receive a great deal more U.S. economic and otheraid _ aid that the document said was part of a deal approved bythen-President Reagan.</TEXT></DOC>
