Open Desktop, is not just a single piece of software ,,'t is an integrated collection of programs.andP;  These are all built around thebasic Unix operating system and offer both users and developers severallayers of operability, with the highest level being the full graphical userinterface.andP;  in addition, there are programs which provide the user withfacilities such as network management and use of an SQL database system.andM;The hierarchical structure of ODT is shown in Figure I,.andP;  The system has beendesigned to run on 80386 processors and to make optimum use of this chip'scapabilities.andP;  At the lowest level is the Unix operating system.andP;  This isSCO's standard Unix System V/386.andP;  This is a well-established product andrepresents the latest generation of the world's best selling Unix software.andO;It offers users a full multi-user, multitasking OSa SCO Unix System V/386fully conforms to all the major Unix standards.andP;  This gives ODT the advantageof being able to run any of over 2500 different Unix and Xenix applicationscurrently on the market.andP;  Merge 386andM;The number of commercial PC Unix programs is small when compared to more than50,000 programs which are now available under DOS.andP;  This is an applicationbase which no one can ignore, and it is not surprising, therefore, thatsupport for DOS is included in ODT.andP;  This  DOS-Unix System Integrationsoftware is based around Merge 386 from Locus Computing Corporation.andP;  Thisallows DOS applications to be transparently integrated with Unix, with fulluse being made of ODT's multitasking environment.andP;  Merge 386 also allowsdevelopers to build applications which simultaneously use both DOS and Unixsystem facilities.andM;Lying immediately above tile operating syvstem in the hierarchy is thenetwork man- agement software.andP;  This is primarily in- tended to support anEthernet based LAN, however support for Token Ring will be added in the nearfuture.andP;  Again these facilities are provided by integrating another wellestablished product into the ODT framework.andP;  The product in this case iscomposed of three packages, SCO TCP/IP, Ingres/NET, and SCO NFS.andP;  The SCOTCP/IP software provides high performance Ethernet and asynchronous communications to a wide range of operating systems and computers, includingboth DOS Net- BIOS and OS/2 LAN Manager.andP;  SCO NFS provides support for adistributed file sys- tem which is full\.andP;  compatible with other LAN basedNFS implementations, and allows full seamless data and resources sharing.andO;Ingres/NET allows sophisticated network database applications to trans-parently operate in a heterogeneous environment.andP;  Together, these programsprovide the foundations for implementing sophisticated LAN systems which canincorporate everything from a PC to a mainframe.andM;Two products lie at the next highest level in the ODT hierarchy.andP;  The firstis X Window, and the other is the Ingres information management package.andP;  XWindow is a well-known industry standard product, first developed by MIT.andO;This version, known as SCO Xsight, is based on X Window System Version 11, orX11, which is the most recent system standard and is currently supported byover 50 companies.andP;  SCO Xsight was originally developed by Locus ComputingCorporation.andP;  It provides the foundation for ODT's high resolution windowingas well as networked access to the processing power of remote systems.andM;The Ingres/386 information management package is a relational database whichincorporates the standard ANSI Level 1 SQL.andP;  Ingres gives ODT a fully,integrated database service, with published open interface specificationswhich are in accordance with the General Common Architecture.andP;  Fordevelopers, this is a very, useful feature since there is full access to theback-end database engine.andP;  To further help developers there are SCO ISAMroutines in C, for creating and manipulating indexed file yvstems.andO;Ingres/386 also supports both client/ server and distributed databasenetworks, and full distributed processing systems can thus be created byremotely accessing the back-end database engine.andP;  Its open architecture alsoprovides connectivity, to other major networked relational database systems.andM;We come finally to the highest level in the ODT hierarchy, the graphical userinter- or GUI.andP;  The  ODT GUI is fully compatible with the Open SoftwareFoundation's OSF/Motif standard.andP;  It is in fact based upon the XLJI Toolkit,as developed by.andP;  Digital Equipment Corporation, and gives the user both the look and feel of OS/2's Pre- sentation Manager.andP;  The only real difference isthe  3D appearance  of HP's Window, bars and so on.andP;  These effects arederived from the incorporation of HP's Window Manager technology into the ODT GUI.andM;At first sight, the collection of programs which mikes up Open Desktop looksjust that - a collection of programs which has been hundled together.andP;  Infact they.andP;  have all been very carefully integrated by  SCO to create arobust, powerful and highly versatile integrated operating environment.andP;  Thatthe constituent components are already well establislied products in theirown right is a big plus for ODT.andP;  The com- ponents are all well debugged, andequally importantly, many developers will  already have experience of writingapplicaitons which utilise them.andP;  The result is that the Open Desktopintegrate 1 operating en- vironment should gain market acceptance much morerapidly than products like OS/2.andM;ODT and OS/2 Operating systems are strange things - they seem to inspire inpeople in almost religious degree of support.andP;  Everyone swears that theirfavourite operating sys- is the only thing anyone in their right mind couldpossibly use, and pity the poor idiots who use anything else.andP;  There aredevoted supporters of DOS who, it seems, would rather the than use OS/2.andO;Similarly many DOS and OS/2 users dismiss Unix as being a top heavy, and userullfriendly operating system which is best confined to being run on mini andmainframe computers.andM;The prejudice against Unix which is held by many in the PC world is, likemost pre- judices, founded on ail obsolete truth.andP;  It is certainly true thatUnix was ill suited to running on a 4.77 MHz 8088 PC with 512K of RAM and nohard disk.andP;  However, with 80386 based systems it is increasingly.andP;  hard todraw a distinction in terms of computing power and functionality between sucha system and a conventional mini computer.andP;  With a small single-user PC therewas little point in having an operating system which supported multiple usersand multitasking.andP;  It made applications impossibly slow nents, such as menus,scroll bars, dialogue boxes an so on.andP;  Any of these can be set up when thewindow is created by using the appropriate API calls to the window manager.andO;Additional windows are created within the main window as child or grandchildwindows, using a similar definition process.andM;Window-based applications are created using the XUI Toolkit.andP;  Here thefundamental abstraction and data type is the widget, which is a combinationof an X Window and its associated semantics.andP;  Logically, a widget is arectangular display with associ- ated input and output semantics.andP;  Somewidgets display information, such as text or graphics; others are merelycontainers for other widgets, for example, a menu box.andP;  Some widgets are foroutput only, and thus do not react to mouse or keyboard input.andP;  others changetheir display in response to an input which invokes functions that anapplication has attached to them.andP;  A large part of writing any ODTapplication is related to the creation and use of widgets.andP;  The basemechanism for building widgets within XUI Toolbox are known as Intrinsics.andO;These Intrinsics are in fact a library package layered on top of the basicXlib functions and thus allow an extensions of the basic programmingabstractions provided by X Window.andP;  There are three ways in which aprogrammer using XLJI Toolbox can create an instance of a widget - he can usea low level function to create it using Xlib, a high level function usingIntrinsics or a special XUI user interface language.andP;  This user interfacelanguage, or Ull,, 'is a very important feature of XUI Toolbox since it makesthe creation of a GUI based application much easier.andM;The UILandM;The XUI User Interface Language is a specification language for describingthe initial state of a user interface for an application written using XUIToolkit.andP;  This specification describes the objects (menus, dialogue boxes,buttons, labels etc) which are used in the interface.andP;  It also specifies theroutines which are to be called whenever the interface changes state as aresult of user interaction.andP;  The programmer specifies the user interface in aUIL module which is stored in a UIL specification file.andP;  This file is thentranslated by the UIL compiler into a User Interface description, or UID,file.andP;  By including Resource Manager, or RM routine calls into theapplication program it is then possible to access the UID file.andP;  This meansthat the RM will build the run time structures necessary to create the userinterface.andM;Using the UIL compiler, a programmer can specify the objects, widgets andgadgets which comprise the application's interface.andP;  The attributes orresources of each object can also be specified, as can the callback routinesfor each widget.andP;  The UIL compiler has tables which contain information aboutall the widgets.andP;  Also, for every object, the compiler knows which otherobjects are its valid children, its arguments and valid callback reasons.andM;If you'd rather not use the UIL, programming can be done using the high levelIntrinsics or the low level Xlib commands in a conventional C compiler.andO;However, coding an application's user interface is far easier, and quicker,with UIL.andP;  It is quicker because the programmer does not need to know thespecific creation routines nor the format of their argument lists.andP;  All thatis necessary is to include just t arguments which must be changed, and thesearguments can be specified in any order.andP;  The lack of any need for order isbecause UIL is a specification language and consequently there is no controlflow.andP;  This tends to make both programming and applicationspecification/design much easier.andM;Programming in UIL is not dissimilar to programming in a declarativelanguage.andP;  There is a separation of form from function.andP;  A programmer definesan application interface in terms of separate UIL modules rather than byhaving the application program directly call XUI Toolkit creation routines.andO;This lets the programmer separate the form the interface takes from thefunctions provided by the application.andP;  This means that it is possible tohave multiple interfaces which share a common set of functions, which notonly reduces programming time but which also substantially reduces the numberof errors.andM;The nature of the UIL language also means that it is ideal for development ofprototype application interfaces.andP;  The reduced programming time makes this apractical proposition.andP;  It also makes it far easier t divide the programmingtask between a team of programmers.andP;  in this ble to have the applicationinterface programmers working with the end users, and making full use ofUIL's prototyping capability to ensure that the user interface is exactlywhat the end user requires.andP;  It also means that if necessary it is relativelysimple and not that expensive to create a customised interface for a client.andM;So that you can compare Xlib and UIL, I have included two samples of code.andO;ConclusionandM;Open Desktop is only three months old at present.andP;  However, it is creatingquite a stir amongst software developers - already about 200 development kitshave been sold, to companies which include most of the biggest names in PCsoftware.andP;  It is without doubt a very good product, which I am certain willgive OS/2 some very serious competition.andP;  Because it is built up from wellestablished components it is robust and well engineered.andP;  it is also verywell supported by Santa Cruz Operation both in the UK and worldwide.andP;  As faras programming ODT is concerned, I have only had time to examine a small, butvitalyv important, part of the whole system.andP;  Certainly with the use of UILit is far easier to create ODT GUI compatible applications interfaces than itis to create similar interfaces with Presentation Manager and OS/2.andP;  Thereare a lot of features of Open Desktop which should prove very appealing to agreat many application program developers, in particular its informationmanagement facilities and multi-user capability.andP;  These are features whichwill also make it appealing to system developers and installers of corporateinformation management  systems.andP;  On this score it should be noted that SCO'sconfidence in their product is sufficiently strong that they feel able to runa thousand-employee company stretched right across the world using just adistributed network of PCs.andP;  The company has no mainframe, vet every employeehas a terminal.andP;  It is a very impressive corporate network which certainlyconvinced me about the quality of ODT and the power of Unix based PC LANsystems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
