OPMmakes its determination by comparing the latest Department of Health andHuman Services state-by-state population counts on primary medical caremanpower shortage areas with U.S. Census figures on state resident population.This is a purely mechanical calculation and could not be changed undercurrent law. Any change in the status of a state reflects a change in thedata provided to OPM. Thus, we see no reason to issue proposed regulationsand invite comments every year. Instead, OPM proposes to announce the resultsof its annual determination in a public notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. OPM's proposed change in its way of providingthis information would begin with its determination for calendar year 1989(which will be made before the November 1988 FEHP open season).<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because they primarily affectFederal employees, annuitants, and former spouses.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 890</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedures, Government employees, Health insurance.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
