(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Living in this coastal town, Elwot Averylearned to pay careful attention to the weather, and on theafternoon of Sept. 21, 1938, his nose told him to expect an``autumnal sou'wester.''   It soon became clear it was something much worse. Trees werealready down when a two-car garage was lifted by the winds beforehis eyes.   ``It went up whole, like a kite, and flew on over the tops ofthe trees and smashed in the road just like so much kindlingwood,'' recalls Avery, now 89.   Impelled beyond reason to see more, Avery left his wife andstepped outside.   His hilltop home had become an island; neighboring houses wereswamped in 5 feet of water. The wind nearly blew him off his feet.He crawled back on his hands and knees.   The Great New England Hurricane of 1938, which had turned inlandvirtually without warning, was the worst natural disaster to hitthe region. Its torrential rains, 30-foot waves and 186 mph windspulverized granite seawalls, twisted railroad tracks like spaghettiand leveled whole forests.   Moreover, the storm was aimed like a giant wrecking ball at themost densely populated part of the country, the so-called GoldCoast between New York and Boston. It wiped out 4,500 homes andbadly damaged 15,000 other buildings, smashed 26,000 cars, sank6,000 boats and tore down nearly 20,000 miles of electric lines.   The death toll was generally calculated at 580 killed, 100missing. Nowhere was it heavier per capita than in Westerly, a townof barely 20,000 inhabitants today and fewer then.   Within hours of the storm's passing, the old Westerly HighSchool became a temporary morgue where bodies _ eventually morethan 100 _ were brought for identification.   Avery, as owner of a funeral home, was put in charge. Since allthe telephone lines were down, he got a ham radio operator to ordera truckload of caskets. Then he worked round the clock for threedays _ ``living on tomato soup and whiskey'' _ to bury the dead.   Among them was his own mother, whose beachside cottage had beensmashed to pieces by huge waves. The last time anyone saw heralive, he says, she was standing in the surf holding the handle ofa suitcase. The suitcase itself had been torn away by the wind.   There were similar scenes of terror everywhere the hurricanestruck, from Long Island to Maine.   As the waves swept through downtown Providence, people ran forhigher ground. Some drowned in the streets.   Claire Powell, who was 9 years old, remembers the terror shefelt when her father did not come home that night.   ``It turned out he climbed a light pole and hung on until he wasrescued,'' she says, still exuding relief 50 years later.   Short circuits caused by flooding set off the worst fire thatNew London, Conn., had seen since Benedict Arnold and the Britishtorched the city in 1781. The flames quickly consumed 30 buildingsand threatened the entire business district.   Firefighters, floundering in water above their waists, watchedin frustration as the hurricane blew the spray from their hosesback into their faces. Only a shift in the wind saved the city.   Across the region, the storm cut power, transportation andtelephones, isolating whole communities. In Somerville, Mass.,physicians delivered babies by candlelight.   As the Connecticut River rose 25 feet and spilled over itsbanks, 10,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas ofSpringfield, Mass.   After the flooding came looting. Fall River, Marlboro andNorthampton, Mass., were under martial law. National Guardsmen withfixed bayonets patroled Providence and Westerly.   But there were also many instances of heroism.   The New Haven Railroad's Bostonian express was trapped, with 600aboard, by floodwaters at a trestle near Stonington, Conn. Hulks ofcottages and boats slammed against the cars. Passengers screamed asthe train swayed dangerously.   The engineer ordered everyone into the first car and the tenderof his locomotive. Wading into shoulder-deep water, he uncoupledthe other cars, then climbed back aboard and opened the throttle,nudging aside a house that had been tossed onto the tracks anddriving the locomotive inch-by-inch across the buckling trestle tosafety.   On open water, it was a rare boat that was able to ride out thestorm. In Somerset, Mass., a 600-foot oil tanker was tossed ashore.In Warwick, R.I., the wind picked up a 30-foot sloop like a toy anddeposited it 40 feet above the ground in the branches of an elm,where it remained perched and little damaged.   Katherine Phillips of Providence was blown half-a-mile acrossNarragansett Bay clinging to a wooden door.   Mary Haggerty of East Providence looked out the window of thesmall office building where she was working and realized it wasfloating in the Seekonk River. She made her way to the roof as thebuilding swept toward the India Point Bridge. At the moment ofimpact, she grabbed the bridge's rail and held on.   In Hartford, the clock in the Old State House stopped at 4:10p.m. An 80 mph wind, the highest recorded in the city, tore offroofs, uprooted trees and toppled buildings.   In Boston, the historic frigate Constitution was ripped from itsmoorings and damaged. Throughout the city, windows bent, then burstout toward the wind, showering the streets with glass. Some 2,000injuries were reported.   The hurricane's damage, in 1938 dollars, was estimated at $400million _ the equivalent of several billion dollars today. But someobservers believe its effects went well beyond damage to propertyand loss of life.   ``It has been described as an act of God in an age ofinnocence,'' says Everett S. Allen, who covered the storm as areporter for the Standard-Times of New Bedford and wrote a bookabout it, ``A Wind To Shake the World,'' in 1976.   ``We lived at that time with a general sense that things wouldalways remain largely as they were. What the storm proved, at firstblush, was that landmarks do not have to endure,'' he says.</TEXT></DOC>
