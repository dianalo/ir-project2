(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Erica SchroederandM;Hewlett-Packard Co. has made a splash with NewWave 3.0, delivering anicon-based user interface that dramatically improves upon Windows 3.0,according to users.andP;  One of the main advantages of NewWave for Windows 3.0 isthe added functionality and memory management delivered on top of Windows3.0.andM;&quot;Just using Windows alone was not sufficient,&quot; said Bob Liotta, a systemsprogrammer for a data-communications firm in Middlebury, Conn.andP;  &quot;NewWave isan easier way to use my computer.andP;  It has allowed me to get data by simplytouching an icon.&quot;andM;&quot;We haven't had particularly good luck with Windows,&quot; said Glenn Pearston, acomputer consultant at Iowa State University in Ames.andP;  &quot;Occasionally thesoftware would lock up the machine, but we haven't had those problems withNewWave.&quot;andM;&quot;Memory management has been a rather large problem for us.andP;  People usingNewWave have found ease of use to be a major benefit,&quot; Pearston said.andP;  &quot;Butfrom the angle of supporting hardware and software, memory management hasbeen the biggest asset.&quot;andM;Bob Chival, a PC analyst for the Putnam Berkeley Group, a New York publishingfirm, agreed.andM;&quot;Hewlett-Packard managed to get around memory management and performanceproblems, accomplishing what Windows does not,&quot; he said.andM;With NewWave Agent, an improved Task Manager and compound document feature,NewWave provides high functionality in an easy-to-use manner, according tobuyers.andM;Liotta praised the power of NewWave Agent and its task language.andP;  &quot;The TaskManager has allowed me to automate a lot of tasks.andP;  It's got a calendar and ascheduler,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;With the compound document [feature], when I change adocument, it automatically changes any occurrence of that documentinstantly.&quot;andM;Dianah Neff, director of information resources for the city of Palo Alto,Calif., initially considered using only Windows 3.0, but felt NewWave wouldprovide additional integration of applications.andM;&quot;The city does a lot of incorporating graphics and spreadsheets and wordprocessing,&quot; Neff said.andP;  &quot;We have repetitive tasks the Agent is able to do.&quot;andM;Integrating both Windows 3.0 and DOS applications is a snap for experiencedcomputer users, but it is sometimes awkward for novices, according to severalbuyers.andM;Liotta, who uses Samna Corp.'s Ami Professional, Software Publisher's Corp.'sHarvard Graphics and Lotus 1-2-3 2.2 under NewWave, said, &quot;It's allmenu-driven and doesn't allow you to make a mistake.andP;  It looks at the programand guides you through it.andM;&quot;For the average user, there's still some difficulty,&quot; said Liotta.andP;  &quot;Youstill need to know a little bit about the application.andP;  [Integratingnon-Windows DOS applications] is the same thing.andP;  Either way, it's the sametool.&quot;andM;Iowa State University's Pearston easily incorporated Computer Support Corp.'sArts andamp; Letters DOS package into NewWave.andM;&quot;The software itself did most of the work, and we haven't had any problemswith it so far.andP;  So I would rate [ease of integrating applications] fairlyhigh,&quot; he said.andM;In addition, Liotta noted that customizing the NewWave Office is just aseasy.andP;  &quot;It's very easy to do.andP;  Everything is in a menu, so you don't have toremember anything,&quot; he said.andM;NewWave's documentation, however, received mixed reviews from buyers.andM;&quot;I'm still spending too much time trying to figure it out,&quot; said JoelDiamond, technical director of the National Windows User Group Network, inMedia, Pa.andM;&quot;There need to be more examples of integrating Windows 3.0 non-NewWaveapplications, &quot; Diamond said.andP;  &quot;I've had to resort to using the macro keyrecorder, which is not even mentioned in the documentation.&quot;andM;&quot;The documentation is acceptable, but not overly impressive,&quot; said PutnamBerkeley Group's Chival.andP;  &quot;For the type of product it is, it should be muchbetter.&quot;andM;Liotta, however, reported a much higher level of satisfaction with NewWave'sdocumentation.andM;&quot;It's excellent, even from an installation standpoint, which is where most[vendors] miss.andP;  If you have a problem, it's in that book.&quot;andM;In spite of the generally high marks from buyers, some noted that there isstill room for improvement.andM;&quot;I would like to see a more extensive report-writing capability,&quot; said Neff.andO;&quot;NewWave gives us integration with our mail system.andP;  It allows you to puttogether a report, but it doesn't give you things like page layout and thenice things you'd like to have in a report.&quot;andM;NewWave's network performance also prompted praise from Diamond.andM;&quot;I can see why Novell and other companies are now offering complete systemswith NewWave.andP;  It really takes sharing information on a network to a wholenew level of integration.andP;  The library checkout feature is great,&quot; he said.andM;The lack of NewWave-compliant applications is also a drawback, according toDiamond.andP;  However, with the new features in the developer's kit, such asanimated views, defined global searches and generic snapshots, forthcomingapplications would be well worth the wait.andM;&quot;When and if NewWave applications start shipping with some of these goodies,I see user satisfaction with NewWave will explode,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
