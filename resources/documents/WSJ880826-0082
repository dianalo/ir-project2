The cards are letting them pay in advance in an expanding list of places -- including toll booths, video-game centers, ski resorts and taxis. Japanese will soon be able to use the prepaid cards for McDonald's hamburgers and drinks at some bars.    Similar cards are in limited use in the U.S., for instance in Washington D.C.'s subway system. But in Japan, where consumers shelled out $1.5 billion for phone and commuter-rail cards last year, the uses are more varied and growing so quickly that analysts say the prepaid card industry could total $15 billion within a few years.    &quot;They're safe, compact and fashionable,&quot; says Atsushi Matsushita, an economist at Daiwa Securities Research Institute.    The cards are simple to use. They are sold for between $4 and $200; a consumer then pays with the card by inserting it into a machine. A digital readout on the machine tells how many units are left. After the card is spit out, it can have a small hole punched in it to show how many units are left.    Nippon Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which started the boom six years ago with its Telephone Card, saw its card sales increase 150% last year. A major boost for the industry could come following the development of a common card that could be used at various places. The Japanese operations of Baskin-Robbins and McDonald's are expected to start sharing a card -- now usable in Coke machines -- for their food products.    The cards appeal to the Japanese, who disdain debt. They're also convenient; people no longer have to carry a lot of change around. And with the cards displaying anything from landscapes to teen idols to nudes, they even attract collectors.    Meanwhile, companies like them because they seem to spur purchasing. Sega Enterprises Ltd., which makes prepaid-card machines for video games, found that people played up to 30% more video games when they used cards to pay.    Putting More Fiber   In Soft Drinks   LIKE AMERICANS, many Japanese are growing concerned that they aren't getting enough fiber in their diets. So Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., maker of a Gatorade-type sports drink, saw an opportunity: a soft drink with as much dietary fiber as half a cabbage.    &quot;Fiber tasted bad, so we tried to make it easier to take,&quot; says Shunichi Kameishi, an Otsuka executive. Its Fibe-Mini isn't exactly lip-smacking or cheap. It tastes like watered-down orange soda, and a slim four-ounce bottle costs about 75 cents.    But spurred by clever television commercials, consumers have downed more than 120 million bottles since January, twice what Otsuka expected.    Now, other companies are jumping in, with tropical fruit and other flavors. Swiss-based Nestle S.A. designed its fiber fruit drink, Fibre Up, specifically for the Japanese market. Analysts say that sales of fiber drinks may hit 400 million bottles this year.    Commercials Become   A Bit Less Obtuse   JAPANESE TV commercials are legendary for their indirectness -- evocatively filmed, but hopelessly obtuse, with the product left unnamed until the final seconds.    That's changing. Japanese ads are getting more direct, ironically at a time when U.S. advertising is adopting more of the soft-sell Japanese style. Cosmetics giant Shiseido Co., well-known for its indirect ads, now runs ads spelling out the benefits of its makeup. Popular ads for Morinaga andamp; Co.'s Chocoballs, chocolate-covered peanuts, feature two singing comedians who repeat, &quot;Eat. Eat. Eat.&quot; Says Toshio Yamaki, professor of advertising at Tokyo Keizai University, &quot;That's nothing but direct.&quot;    &quot;We are seeing the mingling of the two cultures,&quot; says Steven L. Bretschneider, chairman of Hakuhodo SSC andamp; B:Lintas Co., which has had success selling Capt. Igloo frozen fish sticks in Japan by using a direct-sell ad.    The reason for the new directness, marketing experts agree, is the growing competitiveness of Japan's domestic market. But it's more than that. &quot;Japanese ads are becoming more direct because Japanese are getting more direct, especially young people,&quot; says Yumiko Nakamura, an advertising consultant with Tokyo Kikaku Co. But, she adds, advertisers &quot;mix it up with images to make a good impression. They try to make it look like it isn't direct.&quot;    Tamotsu Kishii, a top senior creative director at Japan's Dentsu Inc., the world's largest ad agency, doubts that direct ads will catch on. He says good ads here make consumers identify with the group using the product. &quot;Just pushing information at people and repeating, repeating just doesn't work,&quot; he says.    Odds and Ends   STRANGE NEW Products Dept.: Textile makers imbed microscopic scent capsules between thread and start a fad, smelly neckties. They are only about 10% more expensive than regular ties, but are rejuvenating a mature market. Even though less than 2% of the Japanese use perfume, scented scarfs, socks, pajamas, sheets, sweaters and knitting yarn using the same technology are proving popular. . . . Tokyo's Platinum Pen Co. introduces a radio shaped like a pen. It says the radio is perfect for the office goof-off who doesn't want to get caught goofing off. </TEXT></DOC>
