Actually, the Democratic candidate for governorunderstates its significance. Joe Scott, a Californiapolitical commentator, may be closer to the truth. &quot;It's theBattle of the Marne,&quot; he says, &quot;and the stakes are enormous.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The prize to be won goes beyond the opportunity to governthis sprawling nation-state of 30 million people, which addedsix million residents in the 1980s alone. Withreapportionment after this year's census, California will getmore representation in the U.S. House of Representatives andwill account for one of every eight members. If Ms. Feinsteinwins, she and the Democratic-controlled legislature stand tomake California a Democratic juggernaut for the rest of thisdecade.   They would have free rein to draw the lines for state andfederal legislative districts. They might even manage tocarry California for the Democrat in a presidential election,which is a feat the party has accomplished just once since1948 (with Lyndon Johnson in 1964).   And as the first woman to be governor of California, the57-year-old Ms. Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco,would automatically become a national figure, perhaps aninternational figure.   She has star quality. She pulled San Francisco together ata tragic moment following the murders in November 1978 ofMayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the city'sfirst avowedly gay elected official. (She inherited themayor's job.) Her prominence as a female Democraticofficeholder caused Walter Mondale to seriously consider heras his vice presidential running mate in 1984. In June, shewent through the primary election on a roll, defeating JohnVan de Kamp, the state's attorney general. She cuts ahandsome figure on the campaign trail -- tall and elegant inher trademark red.   Republican hopes to avoid Democratic hegemony in the staterest on the slight shoulders of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. Thebaby-faced ex-Marine and popular former mayor of San Diego,who was elected to the Senate in 1982, is going up againstMs. Feinstein in the November election. At the moment, heseems to enjoy a narrow lead, at least in recent privatepolls. Public polls have the race too close to call.   Mr. Wilson's most effective weapon, one Ms. Feinstein hasbeen known to deploy herself: the power of negativecampaigning.   Where there are issues of any substantial sort, thereisn't much difference in the candidates' positions. Ms.Feinstein and Mr. Wilson both are scrupulously cautious,middle-of-the-road politicians. Both support abortion rights,the death penalty, spending money to fight crime.   So if the race isn't to be decided on issues, it willhinge on mudslinging and, of course, personality.   &quot;Personality matters,&quot; says Adriane Urband, a hotel clerkin Monterey. &quot;They don't have to be the most appealing personin the world, but they mustn't turn me off,&quot; she says.   The outcome of this race looks to be in the hands of theimage-makers, consultants and fund-raisers. Television ads,more than anything else, should determine the outcome.   In a campaign like this, the spoils go to whoever can makethe opponent look worse, particularly this time in matterspertaining to the national savings and loan scandal. PeteWilson is proving to be very good at this sort of thing, andhis organization knows how to win votes in California.   &quot;Pete Wilson wants a down-and-dirty campaign, and he'sgetting it,&quot; says Democratic pollster Paul Maslin. &quot;If thisrace stays punch-counterpunch, both sides slinging negativeads, it's Pete's game, and he wins.&quot; Adds Richard Maullin, ademographics and marketing expert: &quot;Pete Wilson knows moreabout how the process works in California.&quot;   The voters are understandably frustrated. &quot;All we'rehearing is this sleaze stuff,&quot; says Elizabeth Kemper, a LosAngeles lawyer. &quot;My reaction is: Oh, come on.&quot;   Harold Lape, a Macy's shoe salesman in San Francisco, sayshe laughs at the ads. &quot;Each of them is trying to do anegative number on the other. If they're doing those ads forme, they're missing the target.&quot;   Voters want issues, at least they say they do. But in acampaign essentially devoid of any such thing, the ads dohave their effect. And the effect so far is mostly againstMs. Feinstein, who, among her other disadvantages, has lessmoney with which to buy time.   She shares a point of vulnerability that has troubledother successful women in politics -- a wealthy husband withbusiness interests that invite investigation. GeraldineFerraro, chosen ultimately as Mr. Mondale's running mate in1984 (over Ms. Feinstein) spent weeks trying to explain thereal-estate dealings of her husband, John Zaccaro. InBritain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher from time to timehas been criticized for the interests and investments of herhusband, Dennis.   Ms. Feinstein's husband is investment banker Richard C.Blum, who reported personal income last year of more than $7million. His firm, Richard C. Blum andamp; Associates, investshundreds of millions of dollars for nearly a dozen corporateclients, including BankAmerica Corp. and Fireman's FundCorp., not to mention some wealthy individuals he won'tidentify.   He and Ms. Feinstein (she has kept the name of her secondhusband) have lent her campaign about $3 million.   Ms. Feinstein's detractors charge that Mr. Blum is tryingto buy the election for his wife, and the state RepublicanParty has filed a suit saying his loans to the campaign areillegal. &quot;They're flouting the law,&quot; says Sen. Wilson,striding up and down his suite at an airport hotel here,sipping from a bottle of mouthwash. The case probably won'tbe heard until after election day.   Ms. Feinstein and her husband have been reluctant to pumpmore of their own cash into the campaign. And as a result,they are being outspent, with Mr. Wilson picking up millionsmore in fund-raising events, including one on Sept. 17 thatfeatured President Bush.   In a way, Ms. Feinstein's people brought the problems downupon themselves, and, accordingly, on her. They knew from thestart that Mr. Wilson would make Mr. Blum an issue, so theydecided on a pre-emptive surgical strike. In a TV ad, theycharged that Sen. Wilson had received $243,000 in campaigncontributions from savings and loan association executives,more than anyone else in the Senate, plus $9,000 in Sandamp;Lhonorariums.   But though the charge was accurate, the attackboomeranged. As it turned out, Mr. Blum himself has beenheavily involved with Sandamp;Ls. Mr. Wilson and his campaign staffseized the opportunity to put twice the money Ms. Feinsteinhad spent into a TV spot of their own. It pointed out thatMr. Blum had profited hugely from the bailout of JacksonCounty Savings andamp; Loan, in Medford, Ore., in 1988. His paymentfor putting the deal together came to $325,000.   &quot;What they did,&quot; says George Gorton, Mr. Wilson's campaignmanager, speaking of the Feinstein campaign, &quot;is calledhypocrisy.&quot;   &quot;She got hurt&quot; in the volley of charges, says Sen. Wilson.&quot;I didn't.&quot;   A counterpart to the TV ads has been a rash ofinvestigative stories in newspapers around the stateanalyzing Mr. Blum's financial dealings. The latest,appearing Sept. 14 in the Los Angeles Times, noted that Mr.Blum sold $2.7 million in stock -- 15% of his holding -- inNational Education Corp., of Irvine, Calif., in the two dayspreceding the announcement of a management shake-up, whichcaused the share price to plummet. Mr. Blum says he didn'tknow about the imminent happenings when he sold his shares.   The normally cool Ms. Feinstein has been forced to defendher husband's ethics. &quot;He's the most honest person I know,&quot;she says. &quot;I recognize what's happening here, and what'shappening here is {they are} using him to get at me.&quot;   The result of what has been happening is clear enough.&quot;They {the voters} liked Dianne at first,&quot; says pollster Mr.Maslin, &quot;but now some of the bloom is off the rose.&quot;   That is certainly true for at least one California voter,Ted Stemp, a retired aerospace manufacturing engineer inMurrieta. &quot;She seemed pretty appealing at one time,&quot; he saysof Ms. Feinstein, &quot;but now politics is too much in herblood.&quot;   The race is still eminently winnable by Ms. Feinstein, ofcourse. The two candidates are too close in current polls tosay that either is leading. The professionals are counselingher to move on to higher ground. &quot;She needs to paint PeteWilson as a politician of the past,&quot; says Democratic pollsterAlex Evans. &quot;She needs to remember this is the most exciting,most media-driven state in the nation, where being differentis a way of life. She needs to talk about the future ofCalifornia.&quot;   &quot;The theme is still there for her,&quot; says Mr. Maslin. &quot;Thevoters know something has gone wrong in California. They talkabout the pride they used to have in the public schools. Allgone now. They talk about highway congestion, pollution,crime and drugs. They see the {Democratic-controlled}legislature run through cronyism and controlled by specialinterests. Dianne Feinstein ought to take the lead on allthis.&quot;   Bill Carrick, Ms. Feinstein's campaign manager, isn't sosure about that. Yes, Californians worry about crime,education, the environment. &quot;But there isn't an army ready tomarch for an agenda of change,&quot; he says. &quot;They want to do allthese things without raising taxes.&quot;   Moreover, an emotional campaign could just as easily playinto Mr. Wilson's hands. Even though California's populationis becoming less white, largely because of Asian and Latinimmigration, whites still are the overrwhelming majority ofthose who vote. The state's white voters are largelysuburban, and growing old. &quot;This predominantly whitepopulation worries about the exploding minority population,&quot;Mr. Maullin, the demographer, said.   These are Pete Wilson's voters -- regular Republicans andtepid Democrats, white people who live in SouthernCalifornia, especially in the pulsing suburbs surrounding LosAngeles that now stretch eastward all the way to Riversideand San Bernardino.   Ms. Feinstein is painfully aware of her standing in theburbs. At a breakfast fund-raiser in the heavily HispanicEcho Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, she claimed to have80% of the black vote and nearly 70% of Hispanics. &quot;Whitemen,&quot; she said, &quot;are a problem.&quot;   If Ms. Feinstein can find a way to take the initiative andraise the needed cash for TV ads, she does have someimportant cards to play. She favors a sweeping environmentalballot proposal (called Big Green) that would, among otherthings, ban carcinogenic pesticides; Mr. Wilson opposes it.Her running mate, incumbent Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, is thesponsor of a ballot proposal that would increase the statesales tax by half a percentage point, so as to fight a waragainst crime and drugs, which are big concerns amongCalifornia voters.   That is a specifically targeted spending proposal thatseems to be popular with voters. The cautious Mr. Wilson, whohas made crime-fighting the centerpiece of his campaignrhetoric, has no plan of his own to pay for it. Heunenthusiastically suggests that he might actually vote forthe initiative himself.   Meanwhile, he calls his next round of TV attacks a &quot;taleof two cities&quot; -- his record as mayor of San Diego from 1971to 1982 against her record as mayor of San Francisco from1978 to 1988. &quot;I cut taxes when I was mayor,&quot; says Mr.Wilson. &quot;When she was mayor of San Francisco, she raisedtaxes.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
