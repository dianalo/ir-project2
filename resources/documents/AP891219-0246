The Soft-Switch products will be sold by both IBM andSoft-Switch. They will be available Dec. 29 and will be priced from$40,000 to $250,000, IBM said.   Separately Tuesday, IBM introduced the most powerful member ofits Personal System-2 computer family, a model based on IntelCorp.'s i486 microprocessor.
