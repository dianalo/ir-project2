The latest development was a conditional offer of assistancefrom the spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah,believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem factions holding mostof the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon.   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, during a Friday prayer servicein Beirut, said he was ready to help free the hostages if the Westhelps release Arab prisoners in Israel.   Fitzwater and State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler,using identical language at separate briefings, called it ``aninteresting statement.''   ``They should release the hostages,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``Youdon't need to talk about it. Just release the people who are heldagainst their will by Hezbollah. Any help which any party canprovide in the unconditional, safe and immediate release of thehostages is welcome.''   Fitzwater said the administration has not had any direct contactwith Hezbollah and isn't seeking any. Ms. Tutwiler reiterated theadministration position that it was willing to talk with anyone.   Elaborating on his answer, Fitzwater said, ``We always said we'dtalk to anybody and seek any avenue for getting the release of thehostages, but there's never really been an opportunity for directdiscussions'' with the hostage holders.   ``Partly they haven't wanted to. We've said we won't negotiatefor hostages. It just hasn't been fruitful.''   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,expressed skepticism about Fadlallah's offer.   ``This is the kind of thing we've seen him say on frequentoccasions, and he's never done anything,'' the official said.   Fitzwater, describing that state of play after two weeks ofintense activity, said, ``It's a long process and we need to bepatient and let discussions flow back and forth.''   He said President Bush has a sense of urgency on ``the overallsituation, but the most important traits right now are patience anddetermination, to not let urgency push you to say things or dothings that would be counterproductive.''   Insisting there were no new developments, Fitzwater said, ``Wewould like to lower our voices a little and let these issues playout for a few days and see what happens.''   Fitzwater also played down the prospect of direct U.S. contactswith Iran after saying a day earlier that the administrationexpected there would eventually be talks with Tehran on thehostages and communications through third parties.   ``The whole question of direct contacts has gotten so far out ofproportion that I don't want to lend any credence to it,'' he said.   ``We are having any number of contacts through any number ofchannels ... but this direct-contacts business, I'm afraid, hasgotten you off track in terms of focusing on what's reallyhappening there,'' Fitzwater said.   ``There's no miracle there (in direct talks with Iran). It's notthat big a deal. There's all kinds of contacts that can and will bemade _ that have to be made preparatory to direct (talks), andthere need never be direct contacts to solve many of these issues,to change relationships and so forth.''   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported today that Soviet andU.S. officials said Moscow had sent messages to Iran, Syria andPalestinian groups urgently appealing for release of the Westernhostages.   ``The Soviet response has been constructive, helpful andforthcoming,'' the newspaper quoted an administration official.``It's less than we would like them to do, but more than they wouldhave done in the past.''</TEXT></DOC>
